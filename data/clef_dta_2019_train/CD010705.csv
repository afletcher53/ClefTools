CD010705,0,22442316,0,Molecular detection of rifabutin-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"Rapid assays are still needed to detect rifabutin (RFB) susceptibility for proper tuberculosis treatment. To assess the use of the GenoType MTBDRplus assay and subsequent rpoB gene sequencing on detection of RFB susceptibility, we analyzed 800 multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, and 13% (104/800) were RFB susceptible. Of the 104 RFB-susceptible isolates, 71 (68.3%) isolates were rapidly identified using two molecular assays, while the remaining isolates could be determined using conventional drug-susceptibility testing according to the clinician's decision."

CD010705,0,23159109,1,Underestimation of the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to second-line drugs by the new GenoType MTBDRsl test.,"The GenoType MTBDRsl is a new-generation PCR-based line-probe assay for the detection of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). This study evaluated the performance of MTBDRsl in detecting genotypic resistance to ethambutol, kanamycin, and ofloxacin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains. The drug resistance of 262 unique clinical MTB isolates from China was analyzed with MTBDRsl, traditional TB drug susceptibility testing (DST), and sequencing. Sensitivity of MTBDRsl was 62.4% (93/149; 95% CI = 54.1 to 70.2) for detection of ethambutol resistance, 57.9% (55/95; 95% CI = 47.3 to 68) for kanamycin resistance, and 81% (111/137; 95% CI = 73.4 to 87.2) for ofloxacin resistance; specificity was 76.8% (86/112; 95% CI = 67.9 to 84.2), 98.8% (164/166; 95% CI = 95.7 to 99.9), and 91.1% (113/124; 95% CI = 84.7 to 95.5), respectively. Sequencing suggested that 36.9% (55/149) of ethambutol-resistant strains had no embB306 mutation and that 26.8% (40/149) had embB497 mutation not covered by MTBDRsl. Furthermore, MTBDRsl indicated ethambutol resistance in 23.2% (26/112) of ethambutol-susceptible strains, of which 92.3% (24/26) were confirmed resistant by sequencing. This study demonstrated that genotypic resistance to ethambutol, kanamycin, and ofloxacin in MTB can be quickly determined with the MTBDRsl. As a rapid and convenient genetic method, this assay could function as a supplement to traditional DST. More relevant genetic markers are needed to improve sensitivity."
CD010705,0,17035488,0,"Use of smear-positive samples to assess the PCR-based genotype MTBDR assay for rapid, direct detection of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex as well as its resistance to isoniazid and rifampin.","Isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) are two of the most important antituberculosis drugs, and resistance to both of these drugs can often result in treatment failure and fatal clinical outcome. Resistance to these two first-line drugs is most often attributed to mutations in the katG, inhA, and rpoB genes. Historically, the identification and testing of the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains takes weeks to complete. Rapid detection of resistance using the PCR-based Genotype MTBDR assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) has the potential to significantly shorten the turnaround time from specimen receipt to reporting of results of susceptibility testing. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine (i) the sensitivity and accuracy of the Genotype MTBDR assay for the detection of MTBC strains and (ii) the ability of the assay to detect the presence of INH and RIF resistance-associated mutations in katG and rpoB from samples taken directly from smear-positive clinical specimens. The results were compared with those obtained with the reference BACTEC 460TB system combined with standard DNA sequencing analysis methods for katG, inhA, and rpoB. A total of 92 drug-resistant and 51 pansusceptible smear-positive specimens were included in the study. The Genotype MTBDR assay accurately and rapidly detected MTBC strains in 94.4% of the 143 specimens and showed a sensitivity of 94.4% for katG and 90.9% for rpoB when used directly on smear-positive specimens. The assay correctly identified INH resistance in 48 (84.2%) of the 57 specimens containing strains with resistance to high levels of INH (0.4 microg/ml) and RIF resistance in 25 (96.2%) of the 26 specimens containing RIF-resistant strains."
CD010705,0,19634711,0,Comparison of performance of two DNA line probe assays for rapid detection of multidrug-resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"Infections with multidrug-resistant (resistant at least to rifampicin, RIF and isoniazid, INH) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are associated with high case fatality rates. Rapid identification' of MDR-TB strains is important for early institution of appropriate therapy. Two DNA line probe assays, GenoType MTBDR (GT-MTBDR) and INNO-LiPA Rif. TB (INNO-LiPA) were compared for their abilities to detect resistance to INH and RIF in 80 M. tuberculosis isolates. The test results were compared to those obtained by conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST), DNA sequencing and/or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of regions of interest of M. tuberculosis genome. Compared to the DST and katG codon 315 PCR-RFLP results, GT-MTBDR test results were concordant for INH resistance for 63 of 80 (78.7%) isolates. For RIF resistance, GT-MTBDR and INNO-LiPA test results were concordant with DST for 74 of 80 (92.5%) and 76 of 80 (95%) strains, respectively. The GT-MTBDR test results correlated with sequencing results for 77 of 80 (96.2%) while INNO-LiPA results for 79 of 80 (98.7%) isolates. Both the tests are useful for rapid detection of MDR-TB strains, however, GT-MTBDR assay offers the advantage of detecting the resistance to both INH and RIF simultaneously when MDR-TB is suspected."
CD010705,0,21562102,1,Performance assessment of the GenoType MTBDRsl test and DNA sequencing for detection of second-line and ethambutol drug resistance among patients infected with multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"The GenoType MTBDRsl test and DNA sequencing were used to rapidly detect second-line drug- and ethambutol (EMB)-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The ability of these two assays to detect the presence of mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones (FLQ), aminoglycosides/cyclic peptide (AG/CP), and EMB in the gyrA, rrs, and embB genes (for the GenoType MTBDRsl test) and gyrA, gyrB, rrs, eis, embC, embA, embB, and embR genes (for DNA sequencing) was compared to that of conventional agar proportion drug susceptibility testing (DST). We evaluated 234 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates. The two molecular methods had high levels of specificity (95.8 to 100%). The sensitivities for FLQ resistance detection for both methods were 85.1%. For AG (kanamycin [KM] and amikacin [AM]) and CP (capreomycin CAP]), the sensitivities of resistance detection using the GenoType MTBDRsl test were 43.2%, 84.2%, and 71.4%, respectively, while with the inclusion of an extra gene, eis, in sequencing, the sensitivity reached 70.3% for detection of KM resistance. The sensitivities of EMB resistance detection were 56.2% and 90.7% with the GenoType MTBDRsl test and sequencing, respectively. We found that the GenoType MTBDRsl test can rapidly detect resistance to FLQ, CAP, and AM. The accuracy of the GenoType MTBDRsl test for the detection of FLQ and AM resistance was comparable to that of conventional DST; however, the test was less accurate for the detection of KM and EMB resistance and demonstrated a poor predictive value for CAP resistance. We recommend including new alleles consisting of the eis promoter and embB genes in molecular analysis. However, conventional DST is necessary to rule out false-negative results from molecular assays."

CD010705,0,21832013,0,DNA extracted from stained sputum smears can be used in the MTBDRplus assay.,"We examined the feasibility of using DNA extracted from stained sputum smears for the detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance with the commercial MTBDRplus assay from Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany. Overall sensitivity was initially low (70.0%) but increased to 96.7% when a multiplex PCR preamplification step was added. We then tested stored Mycobacterium tuberculosis-positive stained smears prepared from 297 patients' sputum samples. Species identification and drug susceptibility testing (DST) had been performed at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. Overall, the performance of the MTBDRplus assay applied to slide DNA was similar to that obtained in other studies with DNA extracted from clinical specimens. With the ready availability of stained smears in routine diagnostic laboratories and their easy transport and storage at room temperature, this approach should be useful for optimizing the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and for conducting resistance surveys aimed at identifying hot-spot regions and breaking chains of transmission."
CD010705,0,20852939,0,Application of genotype MTBDRplus in rapid detection of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex as well as its resistance to isoniazid and rifampin in a high volume laboratory in Southern China.,"The alarmingly worsening epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) call urgent need for a simple method for the rapid detection of drug-resistant TB in clinical settings. In an attempt to establish a rapid procedure for laboratory diagnosis of TB and investigate the local TB epidemiology, molecular line probe assay of the Genotype MTBDRplus was used to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and detect mutations conferring resistance to two most active first-line drugs against TB: Rifampin and Isoniazid. 96 acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear- positive sputums and 18 PCR-positive non-sputum specimens have been determined for the MTBC and resistance to Rifampin and Isoniazid. The MTBC detection rates in two sources of specimens were 93.8% (90/96) and 77.8% (14/18) respectively. The overall drug resistance (Rifampin or Isoniazid) occurred in 34.6% (36/104). Resistance to rifampin (RMP) was 28.8% (30/104) and 25% (26/104) was to Isoniazid (INH), in which high level drug resistance accounted for 88.5% (23/26) and low level drug resistance accounted for 7.7% (2/26). Multidrug resistance (MDR), defined as resistant to both RMP and INH, was found in 19.2% (20/104) of clinical samples, which was double that of official statistics. In addition, 63.3% (19/30) RMP-resistant mutations were identified in the region of RopB 530-533 and 57.9% (11/19) were the S531L mutation. 84.6% (22/26) of resistance to INH was mediated by Kat S315T1 mutations which conferred the high-level resistance to INH. The Genotype MTBDRplus line probe assay is a suitable and applicable method for establishing the rapidness in detection of drug-resistant TB in clinical laboratory. It will be a valuable addition to the conventional TB diagnostic approaches."

CD010705,0,19386845,1,"Feasibility of the GenoType MTBDRsl assay for fluoroquinolone, amikacin-capreomycin, and ethambutol resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and clinical specimens.","The new GenoType Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance second line (MTBDRsl) assay (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) was tested on 106 clinical isolates and directly on 64 sputum specimens for the ability to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones, injectable drugs (amikacin or capreomycin), and ethambutol in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. A total of 63 strains harboring fluoroquinolone, amikacin/capreomycin, or ethambutol resistance and 43 fully susceptible strains were comparatively analyzed with the new MTBDRsl assay, by DNA sequencing, and by conventional drug susceptibility testing in liquid and solid media. No discrepancies were obtained in comparison with the DNA sequencing results. Fluoroquinolone resistance was detected in 29 (90.6%) of 32, amikacin/capreomycin resistance was detected in 39/39 (84.8%/86.7%) of 46/45, and ethambutol resistance was detected in 36 (69.2%) of 52 resistant strains. A total of 64 sputum specimens (42 smear positive, 12 scanty, and 10 smear negative) were tested with the new MTBDRsl assay, and the results were compared with those of conventional drug susceptibility testing. Fluoroquinolone resistance was detected in 8 (88.9%) of 9, amikacin/capreomycin resistance was detected in 6/7 (75.0%/87.5%) of 8, and ethambutol resistance was detected in 10 (38.5%) of 26 resistant strains. No mutation was detected in susceptible strains. The new GenoType MTBDRsl assay represents a reliable tool for the detection of fluoroquinolone and amikacin/capreomycin resistance and to a lesser extent also ethambutol resistance. In combination with a molecular test for detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance, the potential for the detection of extensively resistant tuberculosis within 1 to 2 days can be postulated."
CD010705,0,22301019,0,First evaluation of an improved assay for molecular genetic detection of tuberculosis as well as rifampin and isoniazid resistances.,"The commercially available line probe assay MTBDRplus 2.0 (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) was evaluated for its ability to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and mutations conferring resistance to rifampin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) directly in smear-negative and smear-positive pulmonary clinical specimens under routine laboratory conditions. A total of 348 samples originating from Moldova, a high-incidence country for tuberculosis (TB), were investigated. Two hundred fifty-seven (73.9%) were smear negative, 12 samples were excluded, and 81 (23.3%) were smear positive. Two DNA extraction methods were applied. Compared to culture and clinical data as the reference standard (adapted from Vadwai V et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 49:2540-2545, 2011), overall sensitivity and specificity were 87.6 and 99.2%, respectively. One hundred four of the 257 smear-negative samples turned out to be culture positive, and 20 were MTBC culture negative but were positive based on clinical symptoms. The combined sensitivity and specificity in the subgroup of smear-negative samples were calculated to be 79.8 and 99.2%, respectively. MTBDRplus 2.0 detected RMP and INH resistance with sensitivity and specificity of 94.3 and 96.0%, respectively. In conclusion, the MTBDRplus 2.0 assay is a rapid and highly sensitive test for the detection of M. tuberculosis strains from smear-positive and -negative clinical specimens and provides additional information on RMP and INH resistance status, which can easily be included in routine laboratory work flow."

CD010705,0,18614561,0,GenoType MTBDR assays for the diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a meta-analysis.,"The global extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) response plan calls for implementation of rapid tests to screen patients at risk of drug-resistant TB. Currently, two line probe assays exist, the INNO-LiPA(R)Rif.TB assay (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) and the GenoType MTBDR assay (Hain LifeScience GmbH, Nehren, Germany). While LiPA studies have been reviewed, the accuracy of GenoType assays has not been systematically reviewed. The present authors carried out a systematic review and used meta-analysis methods appropriate for diagnostic accuracy. After the literature searches, 14 comparisons for rifampicin and 15 comparisons for isoniazid were identified in 10 articles that used GenoType MTBDR assays. Accuracy results were summarised in forest plots and pooled using bivariate random-effects regression. The pooled sensitivity (98.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 95.9-99.1) and specificity (98.7%, 95% CI 97.3-99.4) estimates for rifampicin resistance were very high and consistent across all subgroups, assay versions and specimen types. The accuracy for isoniazid was variable, with lower sensitivity (84.3%, 95% CI 76.6-89.8) and more inconsistent than specificity (99.5%, 95% CI 97.5-99.9). GenoType MDTBR assays demonstrate excellent accuracy for rifampicin resistance, even when used on clinical specimens. While specificity is excellent for isoniazid, sensitivity estimates were modest and variable. Together with data from demonstration projects, the meta-analysis provides evidence for policy making and clinical practice."

A total of 103 multidrug-resistant (MDR; i.e., at least resistant to RMP and INH) and 40 fully susceptible strains isolated in Germany in 2001 in which resistance mutations have been previously defined by DNA sequencing and real-time PCR analysis were investigated. The Genotype MTBDR assay identified 102 of the 103 MDR strains with mutations in the rpoB gene (99%) and 91 strains (88.4%) with mutations in codon 315 of katG. All 40 susceptible strains showed a wild-type MTBDR hybridization pattern. The concordance between the MTBDR assay and the DNA sequencing results was 100%. Compared to conventional drug susceptibility testing, the sensitivity and specificity were 99 and 100% for RMP resistance and 88.4 and 100% for INH resistance, respectively. In conclusion, the MTBDR assay is a rapid and easy-to-perform test for the detection of the most common mutations found in MDR M. tuberculosis strains that can readily be included in a routine laboratory work flow."

The performances of these two assays in detecting the presence of rifampin (rifampicin) (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance-associated mutations in the rpoB, katG, inhA regulatory region, inhA, and oxyR-ahpC genes were compared to that of a conventional agar proportion drug susceptibility test. A total of 242 MDR and 30 pansusceptible M. tuberculosis isolates were evaluated in this study. The sensitivities obtained for RIF-resistant detection by the GenoType MTBDRplus test and by resistance gene sequencing were 95.5% and 97.9%, respectively. The sensitivities for INH resistance detection by the GenoType MTBDRplus test and by resistance gene sequencing were 81.8% and 93.4%, respectively. Together, the sensitivity for MDR tuberculosis detection was 78.5% with the GenoType MTBDRplus test and 91.3% by resistance gene sequencing. The specificity for RIF resistance, INH resistance, and MDR detection was 100% by both methods. The GenoType MTBDRplus test has the advantage of a short turnaround time for drug-resistant M. tuberculosis detection. Overall, the two assays performed equally well in detecting RIF resistance (P = 0.13). However, DNA sequencing demonstrated superior performance in detecting INH resistance (P < 0.001) and MDR tuberculosis (P < 0.001). We suggest that new alleles of INH resistance genes should be evaluated to improve the sensitivity of the GenoType MTBDRplus test, especially for different geographic areas with genetically diverse M. tuberculosis strains."

CD010705,0,16825369,0,Use of genotype MTBDR assay for molecular detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains isolated in Italy.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with a high case fatality rate. Rapid identification of resistant strains is crucial for the early administration of appropriate therapy, for prevention of development of further resistance, and to curtail the spread of MDR strains. The Genotype MTBDR (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) is a reverse hybridization line probe assay designed for the rapid detection of rpoB and katG gene mutations in clinical isolates. The ability of this technique to correctly identify resistant and MDR-TB strains was tested on 206 isolates from the Italian drug resistance surveillance system. This panel included the majority of MDR strains isolated in Italy in the past 3 years. The results of the test were compared to conventional drug susceptibility test performed on isolated strains and verified by sequencing the regions of interest of the bacterial genome. The rate of concordance between the results of the MTBDR and those obtained with ""in vitro"" sensitivity was 91.5% (130 of 142) for rifampin and 67.1% (116 of 173) for isoniazid. We also applied this test directly to a panel of 36 clinical specimens collected from patients with active TB. The MTBDR correctly identified the two cases of MDR-TB included in the panel. These results show that the MTBDR test is useful in the detection and management of tuberculosis when MDR disease is suspected."

The overall rates of concordance of the MTBDRplus assay and the Bactec 460TB system for the detection of RIF and INH susceptibility in clinical strains were 98.3% (61/62) and 79% (49/62), respectively. The rate of concordance between the Bactec 460TB system and the MTBDRplus test for the detection of INH resistance in the group of 27 strains with low-level resistance was 62.9% (17/27), and that for the detection of INH resistance in the group of 21 strains with high-level resistance was 85.71% (18/21). Valid test results were obtained for 78.45% (51/65) of the clinical samples tested. The rates of concordance between both assays for the detection of drug resistance in these samples were 98% (50/51) for RIF and 96.2% (49/51) for INH. Taking into account only one sample per patient, the overall rate of concordance between both tests was 92.85% (26/28). The GenoType MTBDRplus assay is easy to perform and is a useful tool for the management of tuberculosis, as it allows the detection of resistance to RIF and INH in M. tuberculosis strains and also in clinical samples."

CD010705,0,16825346,0,Evaluation of the Genotype MTBDR assay for rapid detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates.,"A novel PCR-based reverse hybridization method Genotype MTBDR assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) was evaluated for rapid detection of rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance in Turkish Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. The Genotype MTBDR assay is designed to detect mutations within the 81-bp hotspot region of rpoB and mutations at katG codon 315. A total of 41 RIF-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates with rpoB mutations that were previously tested by the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB kit and also characterized by DNA sequencing were included in the study. Thirty-seven of these isolates were also resistant to INH. RIF resistance was correctly identified in 39 of 41 isolates (95.1%) with the Genotype MTBDR assay probes specific for these mutations. One isolate with a Gln-490-His mutation and another one with a CGG insertion between codons 514 and 515 were identified as RIF sensitive by the Genotype MTBDR assay. While the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB kit was able to determine the CGG insertion between codons 514 and 515, the Gln-490-His mutation outside the 81-bp hotspot region was not detected by the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB kit. These isolates had MICs of >or=32 microg/ml for RIF. The Genotype MTBDR assay also correctly identified 27 of 37 INH-resistant isolates (73%) with mutations in katG codon 315. In conclusion, the Genotype MTBDR assay may be useful for the rapid diagnosis of the most common mutations found in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. However, the test results should always be confirmed with phenotypic methods."

CD010705,0,19401789,0,Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: rapid molecular detection with MTBDRplus assay in clinical samples.,"Nowadays, the greatest concern of tuberculosis control programmes is the appearance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. Rapid determination of drug resistance in clinical samples, with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), is the prerequisite for initiating effective chemotherapy, ensuring successful treatment of the patient and preventing further spread of drug-resistant isolates. The aim of our study was to determine the sensitivity of the new MTBDRplus assay in comparison to culture, identification and classic DST, directly from smear-positive clinical specimens. A total of 68 smear-positive sputum specimens were processed by both the classical mycobacteriological methods and the molecular assay, MTBDRplus. MTBDRplus assay allowed an accurate identification of MTC species by detection of the specific band in all samples, from which we also isolated and identified MTC strains by culture methods. In the samples from which we isolated susceptible strains (63.2%), wild type patterns were found using MTBDRplus assay. The samples from which we isolated resistant strains (36.8%) showed specific mutations associated with the correspondent resistant phenotype. Our study indicated that this assay allows rapid detection of resistance, always in agreement with classic methods."
CD010705,0,20335420,1,Detection by GenoType MTBDRsl test of complex mechanisms of resistance to second-line drugs and ethambutol in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates.,"The GenoType MTBDRsl test rapidly detects resistance to ethambutol, fluoroquinolones, and second-line aminoglycosides (amikacin and kanamycin) and cyclic peptide (capreomycin) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A set of 41 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis strains, 8 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis strains, and 3 non-MDR M. tuberculosis strains were tested by the MTBDRsl test and by DNA sequencing of the resistance-determining regions in gyrA and gyrB (fluoroquinolones [FQ]), rpsL (streptomycin), rrs and tlyA (aminoglycosides and/or cyclic peptide), and embB (ethambutol). The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl test were as follows: 87% and 96%, respectively, for fluoroquinolones; 100% for both for amikacin; 77% and 100%, respectively, for kanamycin, 80% and 98%, respectively, for capreomycin; and 57% and 92%, respectively, for ethambutol. Analysis of the discrepant results indicated that three FQ-resistant strains (including one XDR strain) with mutations in gyrB were missed by the MTBDRsl test and that one FQ-susceptible strain, identified as resistant by the MTBDRsl test, had a double mutation (T80A-A90G) in GyrA that did not confer resistance to FQ. Five strains (including two XDR strains) without mutations in rrs were monoresistant to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide and were missed by the MTBDRsl test. Finally, 12/28 ethambutol-resistant strains had no mutation at codon 306 in embB, while 2/24 ethambutol-susceptible strains had such a mutation. In conclusion, the MTBDRsl test efficiently detects the most common mutations involved in resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides/cyclic peptide, and ethambutol and accurately assesses susceptibility to amikacin. However, due to mutations not included in the test (particularly in gyrB) or resistance mechanisms not yet characterized (particularly those related to ethambutol resistance and to monoresistance to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide), the wild-type results yielded by the MTBDRsl test should be confirmed by drug susceptibility testing."

The Xpert MTB/RIF assay was endorsed for use on patient material, regardless of smear gradation, while the GenoType MTBDRplus (version 1) has been limited for use on smear-positive patient material. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF and GenoType MTBDRplus (version 2) assays on smear-positive and smear-negative patient specimens submitted to a high-throughput diagnostic laboratory. A total of 282 consecutive specimens were subjected to the two new molecular assays, and their performance characteristics were assessed relative to the routine diagnostic standard. Both assays showed similar diagnostic performance characteristics. The sensitivities of the GenoType MTBDRplus (v2.0) and Xpert MTB/RIF assays for the detection of culture-positive M. tuberculosis were 73.1% and 71.2%, respectively, while the specificities of both assays were 100%. Both assays were able to diagnose the presence of M. tuberculosis in 57 to 58% of smear-negative cases, suggesting that the performance characteristics were dependent on bacillary load. The detection of M. tuberculosis in culture-negative specimens confirmed that molecular assays should not be used for treatment monitoring. The sensitivity and specificity for rifampin resistance detection were 100% in both assays; however, the GenoType MTBDRplus (v2.0) assay provided additional information on isoniazid susceptibility. The GenoType MTBDRplus (v2.0) assay will complement the Xpert MTB/RIF screening assay by validating rifampin susceptibility and providing information on isoniazid susceptibility. In addition, the GenoType MTBDRplus (v2.0) assay will provide pharmacogenetic information that may be critical in guiding appropriate treatment."

Heteroresistance of MTB is considered a preliminary stage to full resistance. To date, no mechanism causing heteroresistance of MTB has been proven. Clinical specimens and cultures from 35 TB patients from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, were analysed using the Genotype MTBDR assay (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany), which is designed to detect genetic mutations associated with resistance to rifampin and isoniazid. Cases of heteroresistance were further subjected to genotyping using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat typing, spoligotyping and IS6110 fingerprinting. Heteroresistance to rifampin and/or isoniazid was found in seven cases (20%). In five of them, heteroresistance was caused by two different strains and in two by a single strain of the Beijing genotype. The latter cases had a history of relapse of their TB. For the first time, two different mechanisms of heteroresistance in tuberculosis have been proven using a stepwise molecular-biological approach: 1) superinfection with two different strains, which is of interest for clinical infection control practitioners; and 2) splitting of a single strain into susceptible and resistant organisms. The latter mechanism is most likely to be related to poor treatment quality and could serve as a quality marker for tuberculosis therapy programmes in the future."

The test simultaneously detects resistance to ethambutol, aminoglycosides/cyclic peptides, and fluoroquinolones through detection of mutations in the relevant genes. The assay format is identical to the MTBDR Hain assay. The assay was evaluated for the detection of second-line-drug resistance in Vietnamese isolates using two sample sets from the microbiology department of Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, with existing conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility results for second-line drugs: 41 consecutive fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates and 21 consecutive multidrug-resistant but fluoroquinolone-sensitive isolates. The sensitivity for detection of fluoroquinolone resistance was 75.6% (31/41) (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 59.7% to 87.6%), and for kanamycin resistance, the sensitivity was 100% (5/5) (95% CI, 47.8% to 100%).

In total, 106 RMP(r)/INH(r), 10 RMP(s)/INH(r), and 80 RMP(s)/INH(s) MTBC strains were comparatively analyzed with the new and the old MTBDR assays. Besides the detection of mutations within the 81-bp hot spot region of rpoB and katG codon 315, the GenoType MTBDRplus assay is designed to detect mutations in the regulatory region of inhA. The applicability of the new assay directly to specimens was shown, since 71 of 72 results for smear-positive sputa and all 125 results for clinical isolates were interpretable and no discrepancies compared with the results of real-time PCR or DNA sequencing were obtained. In comparison to conventional drug susceptibility testing, both assays were able to identify RMP resistance correctly in 74 of 75 strains (98.7%) and 30 of 31 specimens (96.8%). The misidentification of RMP resistance was obtained for two strains containing rpoB P533L mutations. Compared to the old MTBDR assay, the new GenoType MTBDRplus assay enhanced the rate of detection of INH resistance from 66 (88.0%) to 69 (92.0%) among the 75 INH-resistant strains and 36 (87.8%) to 37 (90.2%) among the 41 specimens containing INH-resistant strains.

This report demonstrates that rapid molecular methods may provide information concerning both the level of resistance and cross-resistance to other anti-TB drugs that is important for optimal clinical management. Specific mutations detected by the Hain GenoType MTBDRplus test, recently approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for rapid TB diagnosis and drug resistance testing, could inform the decision of whether to include high dose isoniazid (INH) when treating patients with INH mono-resistant TB, MDR-TB or XDR-TB. The presence of mutations in the inhA gene or promoter region generally confers low level INH resistance that can be overcome by high dose INH. The same mutations also confer resistance to ethionamide indicating little benefit from its inclusion in second line treatment regimens in such cases. This information has high clinical relevance since inhA mutations account for a large proportion of INH resistance, and optimized therapy regimens are crucial to improve patient outcomes and reduce the spread of drug resistant TB.

One hundred thirteen M. tuberculosis isolates were tested. The nucleotide sequences of the katG and inhA genes and the mabA-inhA promoter region were also determined. The MTBDR assay detected 100% and 67% (n = 64) of the strains resistant to RIF and INH, respectively. Among the latter, 62 strains carried a Ser315Thr mutation in katG, 59 of them displaying a high level of resistance to INH. Two strains with a low level of INH resistance had a Ser315Asn mutation. No mutation was found by the MTBDR assay for 31 INH-resistant strains (33%), of which 24 showed a low level of resistance. By DNA sequencing, we found among them various mutations in the KatG protein for 7 strains, a C-->T mutation in position -15 of the mabA-inhA promoter in 17 strains, and a Ser94Ala mutation in InhA for 7 strains. In conclusion, the MTBDR assay, which fits easily in the workflow of a routine laboratory, enabled the detection of 100% of the RIF-resistant strains and 89% of the INH-resistant strains with a high level of resistance but only 17% of the strains characterized by a low level of INH resistance, indicating that the test can be used as a rapid method to detect in the same experiment the rifampin-resistant and the high-level isoniazid-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis."

We tested 175 strains and 59 clinical specimens interpreting the results according to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy recommendations. All the strains were also investigated by spoligotyping and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units-Variable Number of Tandem Repeats typing. The performances of the MTBDRsl in detecting resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQ), second-line injectable drugs (SLID), and ethambutol (EMB) on clinical isolates were similar (specificity ∼ 99%, sensitivity ∼ 70%, and positive predictive value (PPV) ∼ 99%).

We detected a significant association between mutations in the rrs gene and Beijing lineage. The MTBDRsl can be used to ""rule in"" extensively drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis in a high risk group; the low sensitivity and negative predicted value (NPV) make confirmation by conventional drug susceptibility testing mandatory when mutations are not identified. NPV for SLID is higher in Beijing strains, showing that the predictive values of the molecular tests are related to the genetic background."

The proportion of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains in the collections ranged from 21.8% (in Estonia) to 55.9% (in Russia). In a routine non-trial context, the assay reliably detected both rifampicin and isoniazid resistance. The absence of statistically significant differences between sites suggested that the comparable performance obtained using these assays has helped demonstrate the formation of a successful diagnostic trial network."

CD010705,0,22740709,0,Genetic determinants of drug-resistant tuberculosis among HIV-infected patients in Nigeria.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a growing problem in resource-limited settings. Adequate infrastructure for testing drug sensitivity and sufficient evidence of first-line resistance are currently unavailable in Nigeria. We collected sputum samples from HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Harvard PEPFAR/APIN Plus program over 12 months at two PEPFAR antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the southwest and north central regions in Nigeria. Smear-positive sputum samples were submitted for GenoType MTBDRplus testing (n = 415); mutations were confirmed through sequencing. Our results show high rates of DR-TB in Nigerian HIV-infected individuals (7.0% for rifampin [RIF] and 9.3% for RIF or isoniazid [INH]). Total RIF resistance indicative of MDR-TB in treatment-naive patients was 5.52%, far exceeding the World Health Organization predictions (0 to 4.3%). RIF resistance was found in 6/213 (2.8%) cases, INH resistance was found in 3/215 (1.4%) cases, and MDR-TB was found in 8/223 (3.6%) cases. We found significantly different amounts of DR-TB by location (18.18% in the south of the country versus 3.91% in the north central region [P < 0.01]). Furthermore, RIF resistance was genetically distinct, suggesting possible location-specific strains are responsible for the transmission of drug resistance (P < 0.04). Finally, GenoType MTBDRplus correctly identified the drug-resistant samples compared to sequencing in 96.8% of cases. We found that total DR-TB in HIV-infection is high and that transmission of drug-resistant TB in HIV-infected patients in Nigeria is higher than predicted."
CD010705,0,19621606,0,[Evaluation of the genotype MTBDR assay for rapid detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance in clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates].,"Rapid identification of resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates is quite important for the establishment of early and appropriate therapy. The Genotype MTBDR (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) is a commercially available DNA strip assay designed for the rapid detection of rpoB and katG gene mutations in clinical isolates. This study was conducted to determine the mutation types of phenotypically drug resistant 26 M. tuberculosis complex clinical isolates [15 isoniazid (INH), 1 rifampin (RMP) and 10 INH and RMP resistant] by Genotype MTBDR (G-MTBDR) DNA strip assay and to compare the diagnostic performance of this test. Sixteen of 25 (64%) INH-resistant and 9 of 11 (81.8%) RMP-resistant clinical isolates were correctly identified with the presence of hybridization in mutation probe or lack of hybridization at least by one of the wild type probes, by G-MTBDR assay. Hybridization with mutation probes was detected in only 5 of the RMP resistant isolates. We observed rpoB MUT3 (S531L, Ser-->4Leu) mutation in 4 and rpoB MUT1 (D516V) in one of these isolates. In 56% (14/25) of the INH-resistant isolates, katG T1 (S315T1) hybridization pattern was observed at katG mutation probe. G-MTBDR assay couldn't identify two of the 11 (18.2%) RMP-resistant isolates and one of these iSolates was shown to have a mutation at codon 531 (TCG-GCG) and the other at codon 545 (CTG-->ATG), possibly not associated with resistance, by sequence analysis. In four of the eight (8/25; 32%) INH-resistant isolates not identified by G-MTBDR assay, DNA cycle sequencing revealed different nucleotide changes outside the most common mutation zone. One of these were at codon 293 (GCT-->ACT) in katG, one with dual mutation at 279 (GGC-->ACC) in katG and at 15th C-->T in inhA gene, one at 15th C-->T in inhA gene and one at 279 (GGC-->ACC) in katG gene region. DNA membrane strip assay can be a use ful tool for the rapid detection of resistant M. tuberculosis complex isolates and therefore accelerate th initiation of the appropriate treatment. However, due to its restrictions in the determination of relatively rare mutations, this rapid screening test should be used together with conventional susceptibility tests in routine laboratory practices."

Of the total 207 isolates included in this study, 90 (42.0%) were RIF resistant, 107 (50.7%) were INH resistant whereas 86 (41.5%) were multidrug resistant (MDR) by DST. According to genotypic analysis, 37.0% (77/207) were RIF resistant, 50.2% (105/207) INH resistant and 70 (33.8%) were MDR. Among the total 90 RIF resistant isolates, 85.5% (77/90) showed mutation in 81 bp of rpoB gene and the mutation locus were distributed as follows; MUT1 Asp516Val (16.7%; 15/90), MUT2A His526Tyr (6.6%; 6/90), MUT2B His526Asp (5.5%; 5/90) and MUT3 Ser531Lue (56.7%; 51/90). Among the total 107 INH resistant isolates, the mutation located in katG gene was 98.1% (105/107) and in inhA MUT1 gene was (16.8%; 18/107).

CD010705,0,24197880,0,Evaluation of GeneXpert MTB/RIF for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis.,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Microbiological confirmation is rare, and treatment is often delayed, increasing mortality and morbidity. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF test was evaluated in a large cohort of patients with suspected tuberculous meningitis. Three hundred seventy-nine patients presenting with suspected tuberculous meningitis to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, between 17 April 2011 and 31 December 2012 were included in the study. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were tested by Ziehl-Neelsen smear, mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Rifampin (RIF) resistance results by Xpert were confirmed by an MTBDR-Plus line probe assay and all positive cultures were tested by phenotypic MGIT drug susceptibility testing. Overall, 182/379 included patients (48.0%) were diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis. Sensitivities of Xpert, smear, and MGIT culture among patients diagnosed with TBM were 59.3% (108/182 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 51.8 to 66.5%]), 78.6% (143/182 [95% CI, 71.9 to 84.3%]) and 66.5% (121/182 [95% CI, 59.1 to 73.3%]), respectively. There was one false-positive Xpert MTB/RIF test (99.5% specificity). Four cases of RIF resistance (4/109; 3.7%) were identified by Xpert, of which 3 were confirmed to be multidrug-resistant (MDR) TBM and one was culture negative. Xpert MTB/RIF is a rapid and specific test for the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. The addition of a vortexing step to sample processing increased sensitivity for confirmed TBM by 20% (P = 0.04). Meticulous examination of a smear from a large volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains the most sensitive technique but is not practical in most laboratories. The Xpert MTB/RIF represents a significant advance in the early diagnosis of this devastating condition."
CD010705,0,20554815,1,Comparative study on genotypic and phenotypic second-line drug resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates.,"The mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT960) automated liquid medium testing method is becoming the international gold standard for second-line drug susceptibility testing of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates. We performed a comparative study of the current gold standard in the Netherlands, the Middlebrook 7H10 agar dilution method, the MGIT960 system, and the GenoType MTBDRsl genotypic method for rapid screening of aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance. We selected 28 clinical multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis complex strains and M. tuberculosis H37Rv. We included amikacin, capreomycin, moxifloxacin, prothionamide, clofazimine, linezolid, and rifabutin in the phenotypic test panels. For prothionamide and moxifloxacin, the various proposed breakpoint concentrations were tested by using the MGIT960 method. The MGIT960 method yielded results 10 days faster than the agar dilution method. For amikacin, capreomycin, linezolid, and rifabutin, results obtained by all methods were fully concordant. Applying a breakpoint of 0.5 microg/ml for moxifloxacin led to results concordant with those of both the agar dilution method and the genotypic method. For prothionamide, concordance was noted only at the lowest and highest MICs. The phenotypic methods yielded largely identical results, except for those for prothionamide. Our study supports the following breakpoints for the MGIT960 method: 1 microg/ml for amikacin, linezolid, and clofazimine, 0.5 microg/ml for moxifloxacin and rifabutin, and 2.5 microg/ml for capreomycin. No breakpoint was previously proposed for clofazimine. For prothionamide, a division into susceptible, intermediate, and resistant seems warranted, although the boundaries require additional study. The genotypic assay proved a reliable and rapid method for predicting aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance."
CD010705,0,21632897,1,Evaluation of two molecular assays for rapid detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to fluoroquinolones in high-tuberculosis and -multidrug-resistance Settings.,"The Russian Federation is a high-tuberculosis (TB)-burden country with high rates of drug resistance, including multidrug and extensive drug resistance to TB (M/XDRTB). Rapid diagnosis of resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) using molecular assays is essential for the implementation of appropriate drug regimens and prevention of the transmission of XDR strains. A total of 51 individual MDRTB strains were tested by pyrosequencing of the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrA gene and the GenoType MTBDRsl assay (Hain Lifescience, GmbH, Nehren, Germany), and the results were evaluated against those obtained by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Mutations were detected in 25 (78.1%) FQ-resistant strains, with the majority of mutations (n = 19 [73.0%]) found in codon 94 of the gyrA gene; the novel mutation 1457 C→Τ was found in the gyrB gene. Three mixed allelic variants were detected, which is a well-known phenomenon in areas with high TB and drug-resistant TB rates. The sensitivity and specificity of pyrosequencing (86.2 and 100%, respectively) and MTBDRsl (86.2 and 100%, respectively) were high; however, the results for 5.9% of the analyzed strains were unreadable when MTBDRsl was used. The MTBDRsl and pyrosequencing assays offer a rapid and accurate means for diagnosing resistance to FQs in high-TB-burden areas."
CD010705,0,22515295,0,The GenoType® MTBDRplus assay for detection of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Sweden.,"The performance of the GenoType(®) MTBDRplus assay was compared with conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) in 604 patients with tuberculosis. The study comprised 477 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates and 127 preparations of DNA from clinical specimens which had been tested positive for M. tuberculosis by COBAS(®)TaqMan(®) 48. By DST, isoniazid (INH) monoresistance was diagnosed in 56 (9.3%), rifampicin (RMP) monoresistance in 2 (0.3%) and multidrug resistance (MDR) in 21 (3.5%) of the cases. The sensitivity of the MTBDRplus assay was 87.5%, 100% and 95.2% for INH resistance, RMP resistance and MDR respectively. The specificity was 100% for all resistance patterns. The dominating mutations in RMP and INH resistant isolates were in codon 531 of the rpoB gene and codon 315 of the KatG gene. The turnaround time for detection of drug resistance can be shortened from a median of 21 days for DST to 7 days for the MTBDRplus assay. This may have a significant impact on routine work flow of a mycobacteriology laboratory."
CD010705,0,22790204,0,Comparison of two in-house real-time PCR assays with MTB Q-PCR Alert and GenoType MTBDRplus for the rapid detection of mycobacteria in clinical specimens.,"An in-house IS6110 real-time PCR (IH IS6110), MTB Q-PCR Alert (Q-PCR) and GenoType MTBDRplus (MTBDR; Hain Lifescience) were compared for the direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in 87 specimens following automated NucliSENS easyMAG DNA extraction. This included 82 first smear-positive specimens and three smear-negative specimens. Another in-house real-time PCR with a Mycobacterium genus-specific probe for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (IH ITS) was used to allow a full comparison with culture results. The sensitivities of IH IS6110, Q-PCR, MTBDR and IH ITS for MTBC detection were 100, 92, 87 and 87 %, respectively, compared with culture. Both IS6110-based real-time PCRs (in-house and Q-PCR) were similar in performance, with 91.2 % concordant results for MTBC detection. Inhibition rates were low, with zero to three specimens producing uninterpretable results. However, the Q-PCR failed to detect MTBC in five samples that were smear negative or had few acid-fast bacilli (one to 10 bacilli in 10 microscopic fields) detected by IH IS6110. IH ITS was the least sensitive assay but may be useful when used in conjunction with IS6110 PCR results to determine the presence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in smear-negative specimens. None of the real-time PCR assays tested provided drug-resistance data. It was concluded that an IH IS6110 assay could easily be incorporated into the workflow of a diagnostic laboratory for rapid and accurate identification of MTBC from clinical specimens. The inclusion of an internal control and amplification of an ITS target enhance the diagnostic utility of the test."

CD010705,0,23689727,0,Epidemiology of isoniazid resistance mutations and their effect on tuberculosis treatment outcomes.,"Isoniazid resistance is highly prevalent in Vietnam. We investigated the molecular and epidemiological characteristics and the association with first-line treatment outcomes of the main isoniazid resistance mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in codon 315 of the katG and in the promoter region of the inhA gene. Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with phenotypic resistance to isoniazid from consecutively diagnosed smear-positive tuberculosis patients in rural Vietnam were subjected to Genotype MTBDRplus testing to identify katG and inhA mutations. Treatment failure and relapse were determined by sputum culture. In total, 227 of 251 isoniazid-resistant strains (90.4%) had detectable mutations: 75.3% in katG codon 315 (katG315) and 28.2% in the inhA promoter region. katG315 mutations were significantly associated with pretreatment resistance to streptomycin, rifampin, and ethambutol but not with the Beijing genotype and predicted both unfavorable treatment outcome (treatment failure or death) and relapse; inhA promoter region mutations were only associated with resistance to streptomycin and relapse. In tuberculosis patients, M. tuberculosis katG315 mutations but not inhA mutations are associated with unfavorable treatment outcome. inhA mutations do, however, increase the risk of relapse, at least with treatment regimens that contain only isoniazid and ethambutol in the continuation phase."

CD010705,0,20881173,0,Rifampin-isoniazid oligonucleotide typing: an alternative format for rapid detection of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"A reverse line blot DNA hybridization format for rapid detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was developed. Simultaneous detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance in clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was based on the same amplification/reverse hybridization principle of the widely used spoligotyping. The test involved probing nine DNA regions that are targets of common drug resistance-associated mutations in the genes rpoB, katG, and inhA. Addition of quaternary amine tetramethyl ammonium chloride to the hybridization buffer promoted multiple hybrid formations at a single annealing temperature irrespective of the different GC contents of probes. The assay was standardized using 20 well-documented strains from the Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium) and evaluated blindly in a central laboratory with 100 DNA samples that were obtained from cultured clinical isolates and shipped dried from three other countries. Compared with drug susceptibility testing, both sensitivity and specificity for rifampin resistance detection were 93.0% while for isoniazid the values were 87.7% and 97.7%, respectively. Compared with sequencing and GenoType MTBDRplus methods, sensitivity and specificity reached 96.4% and 95.5% for rifampin and 92.7% and 100% for isoniazid. Altogether, 40/45 (89%) multidrug-resistant isolates were correctly identified. Advantages of this in-house development include versatility, capacity to run up to 41 samples by triplicate in a single run, and reuse of the membrane at least 10 times. These features substantially reduce cost per reaction and make the assay an attractive tool for use in reference laboratories of countries that have a high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis but that cannot afford expensive commercial tests because of limited resources."

We evaluated the performance of the GenoType MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) assay on smear-positive sputum specimens obtained from 90 HIV-infected MDR TB patients from Russia. Test interpretability was over 98%. Specificity was over 86% for all drugs, while sensitivity varied, being the highest (71.4%) for capreomycin and lowest (9.4%) for kanamycin, probably due to the presence of mutations in the eis gene. The sensitivity of detection of XDR TB was 13.6%, increasing to 42.9% if kanamycin (not commonly used in Western Europe) was excluded.

However, there are known geographic variations in the mutations associated with drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and especially in South America, there is a paucity of information regarding the frequencies and types of mutations associated with resistance to first- and second-line antituberculosis drugs. We therefore evaluated the performance of the GenoType kits in this region by testing 228 M. tuberculosis isolates in Colombia, including 134 resistant and 94 pansusceptible strains. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the GenoType MTBDRplus test ranged from 92 to 96% and 97 to 100%, respectively; the agreement index was optimal (Cohen's kappa, >0.8). The sensitivity of the GenoType MTBDRsl test ranged from 84 to 100% and the specificity from 88 to 100%. The most common mutations were katG S315T1, rpoB S531L, embB M306V, gyrA D94G, and rrs A1401G. Our results reflect the utility of the GenoType tests in Colombia; however, as some discordance still exists between the conventional and molecular approaches in resistance testing, we adhere to the recommendation that the GenoType tests serve as early guides for therapy, followed by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing for all cases."
CD010705,0,20504986,0,Evaluation of the analytical performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay.,"We performed the first studies of analytic sensitivity, analytic specificity, and dynamic range for the new Xpert MTB/RIF assay, a nucleic acid amplification-based diagnostic system that detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampin (RIF) resistance in under 2 h. The sensitivity of the assay was tested with 79 phylogenetically and geographically diverse M. tuberculosis isolates, including 42 drug-susceptible isolates and 37 RIF-resistant isolates containing 13 different rpoB mutations or mutation combinations. The specificity of the assay was tested with 89 nontuberculosis bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay correctly identified all 79 M. tuberculosis isolates and correctly excluded all 89 nontuberculosis isolates. RIF resistance was correctly identified in all 37 resistant isolates and in none of the 42 susceptible isolates. Dynamic range was assessed by adding 10(2) to 10(7) CFU of M. tuberculosis into M. tuberculosis-negative sputum samples. The assay showed a log-linear relationship between cycle threshold and input CFU over the entire concentration range. Resistance detection in the presence of different mixtures of RIF-resistant and RIF-susceptible DNA was assessed. Resistance detection was dependent on the particular mutation and required between 65% and 100% mutant DNA to be present in the sample for 95% certainty of resistance detection. Finally, we studied whether assay specificity could be affected by cross-contaminating amplicons generated by the GenoType MTBDRplus assay. M. tuberculosis was not detected until at least 10(8) copies of an MTBDRplus amplicon were spiked into 1 ml of sputum, suggesting that false-positive results would be unlikely to occur."

This assay has demonstrated good performance and a rapid time to results, making this a promising tool to accelerate MDR-TB diagnosis and improve MDR-TB control. Validation of rapid tests for MDR-TB detection in different settings is needed to ensure acceptable performance, particularly in Asia, which has the largest number of MDR-TB cases in the world but only one previous report, in Vietnam, about the performance of the GenoType MDRplus assay. Thailand is ranked 18th of 22 ""high-burden"" TB countries in the world, and there is evidence to suggest that rates of MDR-TB are increasing in Thailand. We compared the performance of the GenoType MTBDRplus assay to Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube for Antimycobacterial Susceptibility Testing (MGIT AST) for detection INH resistance, RIF resistance, and MDR-TB in stored acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-positive sputum specimens and isolates at a Public TB laboratory in Bangkok, Thailand."

CD010705,0,21653771,0,Suitability of Xpert MTB/RIF and genotype MTBDRplus for patient selection for a tuberculosis clinical trial.,"Participation criteria for clinical trials in pulmonary tuberculosis commonly include confirmation of sputum positive for mycobacteria and an indication of drug susceptibility before treatment is initiated. We investigated the suitability of two novel sputum-based nucleic acid amplification methods for patient selection in a recent early bactericidal activity study. Spontaneously expectorated sputum samples of 140 consecutive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were examined with direct fluorescence microscopy, Genotype MTBDRplus assay (MTBDR), Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert), and liquid mycobacterial culture. The methods detected mycobacteria or mycobacterial DNA in 96.8%, 90.5%, 92.9%, and 92.1% of samples, respectively. MTBDR, Xpert, and liquid culture were 100% concordant for detection of resistance to rifampin. Sensitivity and specificity of MTBDR for detection of isoniazid resistance were 83.3% and 100%, respectively. For quantification of mycobacterial sputum load, we found a correlation between Xpert DNA amplification cycle thresholds, time to positivity, and microscopy smear grade. The best correlation was found between Xpert and time to positivity (r = 0.54), which were both correlated with smear microscopy with r values equal to -0.40 and -0.48, respectively. We conclude that MTBDR and Xpert are suitable screening tools for determining rifampin resistance in sputum microscopy smear-positive patients before participation in tuberculosis trials. Xpert should be further explored as a surrogate measurement for sputum mycobacterial load."

CD010705,0,22075597,1,GenoType MTBDRsl for molecular detection of second-line-drug and ethambutol resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and clinical samples.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the GenoType MTBDRsl assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) for its ability to detect resistance to fluoroquinolones (FLQ), injectable second-line antibiotics [kanamycin (KM) and capreomycin (CM)], and ethambutol (EMB) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains and directly in clinical samples. A total of 34 clinical strains were characterized with the Bactec 460 TB system. Fifty-four clinical samples from 16 patients (5 were smear negative and 49 were smear positive) were also tested directly. The corresponding isolates of the clinical specimens were also analyzed with the Bactec 460TB. When there was a discrepancy between assays, pyrosequencing was performed. The overall rates of concordance of the MTBDRsl and the Bactec 460TB for the detection of FLQ, KM/CM, and EMB susceptibility in clinical strains were 72.4% (21/29), 88.8% (24/27), and 67.6% (23/34), whereas for clinical samples, rates were 86.5% (45/52), 92.3% (48/52), and 56% (28/50), respectively. In conclusion, the GenoType MTBDRsl assay may be a useful tool for making early decisions regarding KM/CM susceptibility and to a lesser extent regarding FLQ and EMB susceptibility. The test is able to detect mutations in both clinical strains and samples with a short turnaround time. However, for correct management of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, results must be confirmed by a phenotypical method."
CD010705,0,23267627,0,First evaluation in Argentina of the GenoType® MTBDRplus assay for multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection from clinical isolates and specimens.,"Tuberculosis (tB) and multidrug and extensively drug-resistant (dR) tB are important public health problems that are spreading worldwide. The aims of this study were to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the genotype® mtBdRplus assay from smear-positive clinical specimens and isolates and to explore its possible application in routine work. Clinical samples were previously decontaminated using naoH-n-acetyl-l-cystein or naoH-Clna hypertonic solution for Ziehl-neelsen staining and cultures. The leftover sediments of smear-positive samples were stored at -20 °C, 70 of which were selected to be included in this study according to their dR profile. thirty dR Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were also assessed. Sequencing was used as gold standard to detect mutations conferring isoniazid (InH) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance. Valid results were obtained in 94.0 % of the samples and 85.5 % (53/62) of the InH-R samples were properly identified. mutations in the katGS315t gene and inhA C-15t gene promoter region were present in 59.7 % (37/62) and 25.8 % (16/62) of the InH-R samples, respectively. the system could also identify 97.7 % (41/42) of the RIF-R samples; the mutations found were rpoBS531l (66.7 %, 28/42), d516V (19.0 %, 8/42), H526Y and S531p/W (4.8 %, 2/42 each one), and S522l/Q (2.4 %, 1/42). a 98.8 % concordance between the genotype assay and sequencing was obtained. genotype® mtBdRplus has demonstrated to be easy to implement and to perform in clinical laboratories and useful for a rapid detection of dR M. tuberculosis from decontaminated sputa and clinical isolates. Therefore, this assay could be applied as a rapid tool to predict InH-R and/or RIF-R in dR risk cases."

We investigated an unexpected case of rifampicin (RMP) resistance on Xpert using repeat Xpert, smear microscopy, MTBDRplus assay, culture, drug susceptibility testing, spoligotyping and rpoB gene sequencing. A false-positive result was most likely, given the wild type rpoB gene sequence and exclusion of both mixed infection and mixture of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant populations. When decentralising Xpert, test performance characteristics need to be understood by health care workers and methods of confirmation of RMP resistance need to be accessible."

In izoniazid-resistant isolates, the most prevalent mutation was found to be the Ser315Thr substitution in the katG gene (15.8%) whereas the most frequent mutations in multidrug-resistant isolates were Ser531Leu and Ser315Thr in the rpoB and katG genes (26.3%), or a combination of these two substitutions with a T15 mutation in the inhA gene (5.3%). We compared performance of three molecular assays--""TB-BIOCHIP"" (""BIOCHIP-IMB"", Ltd, Russia), Xpert MTB/RIF (""Cepheid"", USA) and GenoType MTBDRplus (""Hain Life-science"", Germany), with the efficiency of luminescent microscopy, and phenotypic drug-suscepibility testing in an automated system BACTEC MGIT 960 (Becton, Disckinson and Company, USA). Xpert MTB/RIF, TB-BIOCHIP and GenoType MTBDRplus detected MTB in sputum in 92, 78 and 49% of all culture-positive cases, respectively. The agreement between standard cultural data and molecular DST results for Xpert MTB/RIF (resistance towards rifampicin), for TB-BIOCHIP and GenoType MTBDRplus (resistance towards rifampicin and izoniazid) amounted to 100, 97 and 100% respectively. Summing up, Xpert MTB/RIF was concluded to be the most efficient assay for primary detection of MTB, whereas the TB-BIOCHIP was shown to be the only molecular assay sensitive enough for simultaneous detection of MTB DNA and for revealing multidrug resistance in sputum (i.e. resistance to both first-line anti-TB drugs, rifampicin and izoniazid)."

CD010705,0,24172155,0,Discordance across several methods for drug susceptibility testing of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in a single laboratory.,"Given the increases in drug-resistant tuberculosis, laboratory capacities for drug susceptibility testing are being scaled up worldwide. A laboratory must decide among several endorsed methodologies. We evaluated 87 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates for concordance of susceptibility results across six methods: the L-J proportion method, MGIT 960 SIRE AST, Gene/Xpert MTB/RIF, GenoType MTBDRplus line probe assay, MycoTB MIC plate, and a laboratory-developed mycobacteriophage quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based method. Most (80%) isolates were multidrug resistant. Of the culture-based methods, the mycobacteriophage qPCR method was fastest, the L-J proportion method was the slowest, and the MGIT method required the most repeat testing (P < 0.05). For isoniazid (INH), 82% of isolates were susceptible by all methods or resistant by all methods, whereas for rifampin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), and streptomycin (STR), such complete concordance was observed in 77%, 50%, and 51% of isolates, respectively (P < 0.05 for INH or RIF versus EMB or STR). The discrepancies of EMB and STR stemmed largely from diminished concordance of the MGIT EMB results (kappa coefficient range, 0.26 to 0.30) and the L-J STR result (kappa range, 0.35 to 0.45) versus other methods. Phage qPCR and the MycoTB MIC plate were the only methods that yielded second-line susceptibilities and revealed significant quantitative correlations for all drugs except cycloserine, as well as moderate to excellent kappa coefficients for all drugs except for para-aminosalicylic acid. In summary, the performance of M. tuberculosis susceptibility testing differs by platform and by drug. Laboratories should carefully consider these factors before choosing one methodology, particularly in settings where EMB and STR results are clinically important."

CD010705,0,22378910,1,Detection of resistance to second-line antituberculosis drugs by use of the genotype MTBDRsl assay: a multicenter evaluation and feasibility study.,"The rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) has been steadily increasing in countries of the former USSR. The availability of rapid and reliable methods for the detection of drug resistance to second-line drugs is vital for adequate patient management. We evaluated the performance of the Genotype MTBDRsl assay compared to that of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (Becton Dickinson Bactec MGIT 960 system) with a test panel of 200 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates at four sites in Eastern Europe. The interpretability of the Genotype MTBDRsl assay was over 95%. The sensitivity for the detection of resistance to fluoroquinolones, ethambutol, amikacin, and capreomycin varied between 77.3% and 92.3%; however, it was much lower for kanamycin (42.7%). The sensitivity for the detection of XDR TB was 22.6%. The test specificity was over 82% for all drugs. The assay presents a good screening tool for the rapid detection of resistance to individual second-line drugs and can be recommended for use in countries with a high burden of MDR/XDR TB. The sensitivity for the detection of kanamycin resistance needs improvement."

The survey was carried out on a collection of 144 strains (126 of which were resistant to rifampicin) isolated on patients from 15 countries. Sensitivity to antituberculosis drugs was determined by a liquid culture system and the reference method was the amplification and sequencing of a target region of the rpoB gene whose mutations are responsible for rifampicin resistance (codons 507 to 533). The assessed kit was based on a reverse hybridization technique using eight overlapping probes covering the target region and four probes representing the most-frequently observed mutations. The assay performance was found excellent, specificity: 100%, sensitivity: 99.2%; 17 mutations affecting 10 codons were reported, two of which were newly identified."

Assay performance as applied directly to consecutive unselected sputum samples has not been established. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of the MTBDRplus test for direct detection of M. tuberculosis (in sputum) and for drug resistance in consecutively submitted sputum samples. In this cross-sectional study in South Africa, one sputum specimen from each person suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis was tested by smear microscopy, direct MTBDRplus, and Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) culture with MGIT drug susceptibility testing. MGIT results were the reference standard. We tested 2,510 sputum samples, and 529 (21.1%) were positive for M. tuberculosis by MGIT. Direct MTBDRplus identified M. tuberculosis in 256 of 529 specimens (sensitivity, 48.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 44.1, 52.7). The sensitivity of MTBDRplus for M. tuberculosis detection by sputum smear status was as follows: smear negative, 13.7% (95% CI, 9.8, 18.4); smear scanty, 46.2% (95% CI, 19.2, 74.9); smear 1+, 69.1% (95% CI, 55.2, 80.9); smear 2+, 86.3% (95% CI, 73.7, 94.3); smear 3+, 89.8% (95% CI, 83.7, 94.2). Direct MTBDRplus testing was negative for 1,594/1,612 sputum samples that were culture negative for M. tuberculosis (specificity, 98.9%; 95% CI, 98.2, 99.3). For specimens positive for M. tuberculosis by MTBDRplus, this assay's sensitivity and specificity for rifampin resistance were 85.7% (95% CI, 57.2, 98.2) and 96.6% (95% CI, 93.2, 98.6) and for isoniazid resistance they were 62.1% (95% CI, 42.3, 79.3) and 97.9% (95% CI, 94.8, 99.4). For sputum testing, the sensitivity of MTBDRplus is directly related to the specimen's bacillary burden. Our results support recommendations that the MTBDRplus test not be used for direct testing of smear-negative or paucibacillary sputum samples."
