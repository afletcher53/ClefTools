CD010657,0,11696792,0,Fetal intervention for myelomeningocele: effect on postnatal bladder function.,"Myelomeningocele is the most common congenital malformation of the central nervous system noted on prenatal ultrasound. Due to its significant postnatal sequelae, treatment in utero could potentially have a profound impact on the newborn. Others have reported fetal surgical techniques for in utero repair of myelomeningocele and its potential benefits on motor and neurological function. We report our urodynamic findings in the newborn after in utero repair of spina bifida in an effort to characterize postnatal bladder function."
CD010657,0,8251316,0,Ultrasonographic evaluation of bladder volume in children.,"Although ultrasound has been recently used to estimate bladder volume, several different formulae are used. We analysed the accuracy of ultrasound evaluation of bladder volume with an ultrasound scanner equipped with a videocassette recorder. We determined three dimensions of the bladder, i.e. depth (D), height (H) and width (W) by reviewing videotapes in 53 children. D x H x W (DHW) showed a good linear relationship with actual bladder volume (r = 0.96). Estimation of bladder volume by the regression equation gave errors of 12.5 +/- 8.6% (mean +/- SD) with errors above 25% in only 6% of children. Estimation of the volume by simply multiplying DHW by a correction factor of 0.80 gave a greater error of 18.9 +/- 14.0% (P < 0.001) with errors above 25% in 24% of children. Thus, the use of the formula volume (ml) = DHW (cm3) x 0.68+4 was sufficiently accurate in the ultrasound estimation of bladder volume in children."
CD010657,0,26069177,0,Clinical Course and Effective Factors of Primary Vesicoureteral Reflux.,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is one of the most important causes of urinary tract infection and renal failure in children. It is a potentially self-limited disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical course and significant factors in children with primary VUR. The medical charts of 125 infants and children (27.2 % males, 72.8% females) with all grades of primary VUR were retrospectively reviewed. Mean age at diagnosis was 22.3 ± 22.9 months. 52% of patients had bilateral VUR. Mild reflux (Grade I, II) was the most common initial grade. 53.6% of patients achieved spontaneous resolution. 30.1% of patients had decreased renal function on initial DMSA renal scan, significantly in males and severe VUR. Reflux nephropathy occurred in 17.6% of patients, especially in renal damage and male sex. No significant association was observed between recurrent urinary tract infection with the severity of VUR, and the presence of renal damage at admission. Age at diagnosis, gender, grade, laterality, the absence of recurrent urinary tract infection and renal damage had a significant correlation between spontaneous VUR resolution. Spontaneous resolution of primary VUR occurred significantly in female patients, age ≤ 30 months at diagnosis, mild-to-moderate VUR, unilateral reflux, the absence of recurrent urinary tract infection, and renal damage."
CD010657,0,14752568,0,Urinary tract infection in infants and children: an update with special regard to the changing role of reflux.,"The aim of this study was to present current theories of pathogenesis and prognosis in urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal scarring during infancy and childhood, with special regard to new insights concerning the role of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR). For a long time VUR and UTI were considered the only risk factors for renal scarring in childhood. Now a wider spectrum of contributing conditions is commonly accepted, which all may pose different clinical consequences and require different imaging approaches. Particularly bilateral renal scarring causes long-term sequalae; therefore, renal involvement in UTI with potential scarring has become the clinical and imaging focus, and proper diagnosis of UTI as the key factor for further management has become even more important. The VUR still remains one issue on a list of important factors such as treatment onset and response, bacterial virulence, immunological factors, genetic disposition, anatomical variants, and lower urinary tract dysfunction. Recent advances in knowledge leading to changed patho-physiological concepts, and new imaging techniques, may consecutively impact the presently established standard imaging algorithms. New, advanced imaging techniques offer improved and accelerated comprehensive imaging of the paediatric urinary tract. At present, this is complimentary to the established gold standard techniques. Strong research efforts have to be made before suggesting significant changes of current imaging concepts; however, based on recent technical advances and new insight on the natural history of paediatric urological diseases, potential changes of established imaging algorithms need to be discussed and evaluated."

Hydronephrosis accounts for 75% of prenatally diagnosed fetal renal abnormalities with, in many cases, renal dysplasia, oligohydramnios and Potter's sequence. With ultrasound is possible to diagnose most urinary tract obstructions that occurs in 1% of all pregnancy, but only 0.2% have clinical relevance. We have conceived an ultrasonographic protocol to evaluate the renal and urinary tract morphology, the cystis, the amniotic fluid and the external genitalia for a more easy ultrasonographic diagnosis and for the exact pre and postnatal management."
CD010657,0,19582482,0,Outcome and management of isolated moderate renal pelvis dilatation detected at postnatal screening.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and outcome of isolated moderate renal pelvis dilatation (RPD) [anterior-posterior diameter (APD) 10-15 mm] in an unselected population of 2-month-old infants prospectively followed for up to 12-14 months of life. Isolated moderate renal pelvis dilatation was detected in 282 of the 11,801 (2.4%), infants screened; 240 infants with normal renal ultrasound were enrolled as the control group. Resolution of RPD was considered when an APD <or= 5 mm was found on two consecutive sonograms. Urological investigations were initiated if the RPD persisted or if urinary tract infection (UTI) occurred during follow-up, and antibiotic therapy was administered only when UTI occurred. The events of interest were resolution of the RPD, presence of uropathy and UTI. At follow-up, RPD persisted only in 18 infants; of these, four infants were diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux (grade 1-3) and 14 with ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Of the 223 infants with RPD and 230 control infants who completed follow-up, UTI occurred in 3.6 and 2.5%, respectively. The incidence rate of UTI per 1000 person-months was 5.98 episodes in the patient group and 5.22 episodes in the control group. The rate ratio was 1.146 (95% confidence interval 0.389-3.54, p = 0.8). Our data suggest that isolated moderate RPD is essentially a self-limiting condition and that antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of UTI should not be performed. A non-invasive ultrasound scan performed during the follow-up is sufficient to diagnose a potentially dangerous and persistent RPD."

CD010657,0,19375898,0,[Urinary tract infections in children].,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is relatively frequent in children. The younger the child is, the more symptoms are atypical. UTI is often associated with functional or malformative uropathy, such as vesico-ureteral reflux or obstruction. Appropriate imaging studies should be carried out in every infected child. The prognosis of uncomplicated UTI is very good, but is less favorable when the UTI is associated with urological abnormalities. Development of pyelonephritic scars can lead to kidney scarring, for which the occurrence of intrarenal reflux is probably responsible . Short-term treatment is recommended for uncomplicated UTI. Uncomplicated UTI with frequent relapses requires prophylactic chemotherapy; this treatment should also be considered when UTI is associated with vesico-ureteral reflux. Surgery is indicated in the presence of major urological malformations. Whether medical or surgical, the treatment of UTI should be followed by urine cultures whenever the child presents with fever. The antibiotic treatment of acute pyelonephritis must be started immediately, preferentially by intravenous route. A switch to oral treatment can be made after obtaining the results of the antibiogram. UTI represents a major risk in neonates; it should preferably be managed in specialized centers."

CD010657,0,14676444,0,Clinical characteristics and outcome of hydronephrosis detected by prenatal ultrasonography.,"The widespread use of prenatal ultrasound results in an increased recognition of fetal hydronephrosis. To determine clinical characteristics and postnatal outcome of fetal hydronephrosis, we performed a retrospective study in children diagnosed as having fetal hydronephrosis between 1990 and 2001. 341 children with 427 dilated kidneys were included. Dilatation of the renal pelvis was caused by primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction in 65.6%, multicystic kidney in 9.4%, vesicoureteral reflux in 7.0%, duplex system in 5.4%, ureterovesical junction obstruction in 4.0%, and posterior urethral valves in 3.0%. Hydronephrosis resolved spontaneously in 126 (29.5%) kidneys, with 52.7% of mild hydronephrosis, and 2.6% of severe hydronephrosis. Mean interval to spontaneous resolution was 1.39 (+/- 1.41, SD) yr. Surgery was performed in 174 kidneys, including pyeloplasty in 105, ureteroneocystostomy in 23, transurethral incision in 11 and nephrectomy in 9. Most patients had initially high-grade hydronephrosis (p<0.05). Mild hydronephrosis appears to be relatively benign, and in most cases, dilatation improves with time, and thus surgical intervention is not required. On the other hand, moderate or severe hydronephrosis often results in a significantly poor outcome and requires surgical intervention, and therefore, requires closer follow-up both antenatally and postnatally."

CD010657,0,12928758,0,Intrarenal reflux: diagnosis with contrast-enhanced harmonic US.,"The objective of this case report is to demonstrate the possibility of visualizing intrarenal reflux (IRR) in children using contrast-enhanced harmonic voiding urosonography (VUS). A 10-month-old girl underwent VUS as part of the work-up of acute pyelonephritis of the right kidney. Before and after intravesical administration of US contrast medium (Levovist) the urinary tract was scanned in harmonic imaging mode. Bilateral vesicoureteric reflux was detected (right grade IV, left grade III). Moreover, at the height of the reflux the right kidney parenchyma turned markedly echogenic, corresponding to massive IRR. The voiding cystourethrography that followed confirmed the results of the VUS."
CD010657,0,9102939,0,[Detection of vesicoureteral reflux with radionuclide cystography].,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) an be detected by both X-ray and radionuclide cystography. The principal advantage of radionuclide method is considerably lower radiation dose used. 201 girls with urinary tract infection were evaluated for vesicoureteral reflux by direct radionuclide cystography (DRCG). VUR was detected in 60 children (30%). Comparative study between DRCG and voiding uretrocystography (VCUG) performed in 54 girls demonstrated no significant difference in sensitivity between these methods. Thus, DRCG could be recommended as alternative and complementary method to the conventional VCUG, for evaluation of VUR. Indications for application of radionuclide method are discussed."

CD010657,0,1433600,0,Fetal vesicoureteral reflux: outcome following conservative postnatal management.,"Of 222 infants with a urinary tract abnormality detected antenatally 30 male and 9 female patients (64 renal units) were found to have primary vesicoureteral reflux. Grade of reflux was predominantly severe, with grade III or higher noted in 83% of the patients. Prenatal and postnatal ultrasound failed to detect any abnormality in 29 refluxing units (45%) discovered contralateral to the known abnormal system, although 19 had grade III or higher reflux. Of the 64 refluxing units 8 underwent primary ureteral reimplantation, 12 were lost to followup and 44 were managed conservatively for a mean of 3.3 years. Reflux ceased in 61% of the cases, improved in 14% and remained unchanged in 23%. In only 1 unit did the grade of reflux increase. Documented urinary tract infection occurred in 6 of the 39 reflux patients. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renography performed in 21 infection-free patients demonstrated global reduction in renal parenchyma in 4 units, focal parenchymal defects in 3 and normal function in 14. Conservative postnatal management of fetal vesicoureteral reflux is justified. Global and focal parenchymal changes can occur in the kidneys of infants with reflux despite the absence of urinary tract infection."
CD010657,0,1433601,0,Commentary: importance of antenatal diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux.,"Although hydronephrosis detected by prenatal ultrasonography often is assumed to be secondary to obstructive uropathy, in approximately 10% of the cases renal pelvic dilatation results from primary vesicoureteral reflux. More than 80% of neonates with reflux are male and two-thirds have bilateral reflux. Approximately 80% have at least grade III reflux. At birth between a third and half may have reduced renal function on isotope renography, even in the absence of urinary infection. Approximately 20% of neonates with grade IV or V reflux followed nonoperatively experience spontaneous reflux resolution by age 2 years. However, in approximately 25% of boys followed nonoperatively urinary tract infections developed by age 2 years despite antimicrobial prophylaxis. Because the majority of these boys have been uncircumcised, circumcision seems advisable. Ureteral reimplantation should be reserved for those with breakthrough urinary tract infection, new renal scars or persistent high grade reflux."

CD010657,0,11417754,0,Renal scars masquerading as complex masses in a patient with vesicoureteral reflux nephropathy.,"Vesicoureteral reflux can lead to chronic pyelonephritis, renal scarring, and renal failure. We present a case of renal scarring masquerading as bilateral, complex renal masses. A 35-year old woman who was diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux as a child presented for evaluation of recently developed hypertension and an abnormal renal ultrasound. Her serum creatinine level was 2.5 mg/dL and she had subnephrotic-range proteinuria. A renal sonogram showed small, echogenic kidneys and bilateral complex renal masses of 3.8 (right) and 4.4 (left) cm in greatest dimensions. CT scan of the kidneys revealed slightly contrast-enhancing masses with irregular walls. Renal angiogram showed decreased blood supply to the areas coinciding with the masses consistent with renal scarring. There was no increased vascularity. This case demonstrates that renal scarring may masquerade as renal masses. A step-wise, comprehensive approach is necessary to rule out potentially malignant lesions in these patients."
CD010657,0,23086593,0,Can postpyelonephritic renal scarring be prevented?,"Pyelonephritis in childhood may, in the worst cases, lead to long-term cardiovascular morbidity due to tubulointerstitial renal scarring. Renal damage is the end result of an interplay between (1) urinary tract anatomy and function, (2) bacterial virulence factors, and (3) the host innate immune system, which on the one hand manages bacterial clearance, but on the other causes tubulointerstitial inflammation, which underlies the renal scarring. It is unclear how common postpyelonephritic scarring is, and how many of the ""scars"" in fact represent congenital renal hypoplasia. We do, however, know that some situations have an increased risk for scars, i.e., large renal-uptake defects on initial renal scintigraphy or pyelonephritis in young girls with dilating vesicoureteral reflux. It seems logical that antiinflammatory or antioxidant therapy given concomitantly with antibiotics should lower the risk of postpyelonephritic scarring. Animal studies give some support to this idea, but research on humans has been surprisingly scant. In this issue of Pediatric Nephrology, we publish a study that indicates that antioxidant therapy with vitamin A or E given to children with pyelonephritis may indeed lower the risk for renal scarring. This is a track that needs to be pursued further."

CD010657,0,3908917,0,[Diagnostic value of sonography in vesico-ureteral reflux in infancy and childhood].,"The direct demonstration of reflux by filling of the urinary bladder using real time sonography is a new method avoiding radiation exposure. Since 1979 we use this technique (Miktions-Cysto-Sonographie, MCS) as routine procedure. In 117 cases with 163 radiologically diagnosed refluxes we could demonstrate, that refluxes of grad II or higher gave a positive sonogram. As a consequence it is proposed, that for children with urinary tract infections the first examinations should be the sonography of kidneys and the sonographic evaluation of reflux. In the cases of conservatively treated refluxes the check-up of the reflux is carried out only sonographically. The same is valid for the control after antireflux surgery. Thus radiological examinations are necessary only for sonographically suspicious findings. The urinary tract obstruction after antireflux operations is detected sonographically, too. In 99 cases of antireflux operations it could be shown, that the urinary flow came back to the normal state within 3 months post operation."

CD010657,0,23636578,0,Does the ureteric jet Doppler waveform have a role in detecting vesicoureteric reflux?,"Data reported in this issue of Pediatric Nephrology suggest that the ureteric jet Doppler waveform can predict the occurrence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Many different methods are currently used to detect VUR, including traditional X-ray micturating cystourethrogram, indirect and direct nuclear imaging and contrast enhanced ultrasonography. These methods are invasive, do have some radiation burden and are also quite uncomfortable to paediatric patients. This relatively new non-invasive method is therefore of interest, but its efficacy needs to be confirmed in further studies and, in particular, in babies and infants before it can possibly be considered as a good method to provide clinical information on VUR. Once such studies have been performed, this method may also prove to be a useful approach to obtain modern knowledge on the occurrence of VUR in healthy children."
CD010657,0,11260484,0,Extravesical ureteroneocystostomy with and without internalized ureteric stents in pediatric renal transplantation.,"The use of ureteric double-J stents and the Lich-Gregoir (extravesical) technique of ureteroneocystotomy have both been shown to decrease the rate of urologic complications in adult kidney transplantation (Tx). There are, however, few studies of the systematic use of stents in pediatric renal Tx. Between 1991 and 1997, 32 consecutive pediatric renal transplant recipients routinely received a 6F-12 cm indwelling double-J stent and were studied prospectively. These patients were compared with 32 consecutive pediatric recipients in whom a stent was not used. The latter were transplanted between 1987 and 1991 and formed the control group. All patients had a Lich-Gregoir ureteroneocystotomy. Stents were removed under general-anesthetic cystoscopy 2 3 weeks after Tx. Immunosuppression for stented patients was polyclonal antibody induction, delayed (7-10 days) cyclosporin A, azathioprine, and prednisone. The control group received the same triple drug regimen but with no induction in 29 of the 32 patients. All patients were followed-up with at least one ultrasound evaluation in the first month, and a renal scan and repeat ultrasound were performed if there was any rise in serum creatinine. In the stented group there were two patients with urinary leak and no obstructions. In the non-stented group there were no leaks and one obstruction. There was no graft loss owing to urologic complications in either group. There were three cases of stent expulsion (all in girls) and one case of stent migration in the posterior urethra (a boy). The 1-yr graft survival rate was 90.6% in the stented group and 65.6% in the non-stented group. The prophylactic use of an indwelling ureteral stent in pediatric renal Tx did not reduce the risk of urinary leakage or obstruction. Stent migration is a common phenomenon and, while not a serious complication, is traumatic to children. Furthermore, removal of an internalized double-J stent requires a general anesthetic. We recommend using a stent for selected patients only."

There is sufficient information on the technical validity of the various imaging tests. Through calculating probabilities, this information can be used in the process of diagnostic decision making. Nevertheless, the diagnostic yield offered by these tests is unclear; some of the estimations of costs, efficacy and risks suggest that certain diagnoses have little clinical importance. The current strategy of routine use of imaging tests should probably be replaced by an individually-tailored approach, in which tests are indicated by taking into account the information available at each stage of the process, patients' and relatives' opinions, and clinicians' judgment on the probability of the diagnoses and the risks and benefits of each test."

CD010657,0,8410507,0,Prevalence of hypertension in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux.,"This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of hypertension in children with primary, uncomplicated vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and to evaluate the relationship between blood pressure (BP), grade and duration of reflux, and renal scarring. Subjects were identified retrospectively during a 17-year period; of 146 subjects who agreed to participate, 129 (88.4%) were female. Mean age at diagnosis was 5.0 years (range, 1 month to 16 years), and at follow-up was 14.4 years (range, 5 months to 21 years). Mean duration of follow-up was 9.6 years. Renal scarring was detected in 34.3% of patients by intravenous pyelogram, ultrasonography, or both. The BP at diagnosis was linearly related to the grade of reflux, but values were not higher than expected norms for age. At follow-up, mean systolic and diastolic BP were at the 41.6 percentile and the 18.7 percentile, respectively. No patient's BP was above the 55th percentile. After a mean follow-up period of 10 years, we conclude that primary, uncomplicated VUR, regardless of the number of documented urinary tract infections, duration and severity of reflux, modality of therapy, presence of renal scarring, and duration of follow-up, is not associated with the development of hypertension. Hypertension does not appear to be a complication of VUR and urinary tract infection unless there is preexisting dysplasia."

CD010657,0,11387761,0,"Megaureter: classification, pathophysiology, and management.","The term megaureter does not define a specific pathological condition, because it can be due to different underlying abnormalities.

Each group can be divided into two subgroups: primary megaureter; secondary megaureter. With the advent of antenatal ultrasound an increased number of cases are identified prior to the onset of symptoms. The common used investigation are: urinary tract ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography, urography, serial diuretic renography and pressure-perfusion studies (Whitaker test). The advent of prenatal and neonatal echography has modified the natural history of megaureter. Nowadays non operative management is preferred. Operative intervention is indicated only in these cases: significant impairment to urine flow; worsening renal function during the observation time; recurrent UTI in spite of adequate antibiotic prophylaxis."

CD010657,0,3544745,0,Imaging in acute renal infection in children.,"Infection is the most common disease of the urinary tract in children, and various imaging techniques have been used to verify its presence and location. On retrospective analysis, 50 consecutive children with documented upper urinary tract infection had abnormal findings on renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-glucoheptonate. The infection involved the renal poles only in 38 and the poles plus other renal cortical areas in eight. Four had abnormalities that spared the poles. Renal sonograms were abnormal in 32 of 50 children. Excretory urograms were abnormal in six of 23 children in whom they were obtained. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 34 of 40 children in whom voiding cystourethrography was performed. These data show the high sensitivity of renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-glucoheptonate in documenting upper urinary tract infection. The location of the abnormalities detected suggests that renal infections spread via an ascending mode and implies that intrarenal reflux is a major contributing factor."

CD010657,0,10649899,0,[The captopril test--an aid in the detection of scarring nephropathy as a cause of arterial hypertension in children].,"Renal scarring with and without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been now recognized as an important cause of paediatric hypertension for many years [1-5]. However, its pathogenesis has still remained uncleared. The widespread concept implicated the activation of renin-angiotensin system finding a powerfull support in higher peripheral plasma renin activity (PRA) in children with reflux nephropathy than in controls [6, 7] and in beneficial antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors. The latter, in form of captopril, has also been used in captopril test and in renal scintigraphy and isotope renography following the administration of captopril to provide evidence for renin dependent hypertension [8, 9]. Published studies of captopril test have centred on the identification of renovascular as opposed to essential hypertension [10-18, 20-22]. The aim of our study was to assess the usefulness of captopril test in differentiation between hypertensive children with renal scarring from those with essential hypertension. We studied blood pressure (BP) and PRA responses to a single dose of captopril in two groups of hypertensive children. Group A consisted of 29 patients, 14 boys and 15 girls, who had renal scaring as demonstrated by renal 99mTc dimercaptosuccinid acid scan (99m Tc DMSA) and/or intravenous pyelography. Group B included 19 patients, 19 boys and 10 girls who had arterial hypertension, while clinical examination excluded renal and other definable causes of BP elevation, and they were therefore considered to have essential hypertension. At the time of the study all patients had normal glomerular filtration rate and were not salt depleted. They did not receive any antihypertensive medication for at least two weeks. The test was performed in the morning in fasting sitting patients. At the start of the test a small vein in the hand or forearm was cannulated to permit blood sampling. BP was measured 10, 20, and 30 minutes before captopril administration to get baseline BP (mean of these three measurements) and to allow the children to become accustomed to the test procedure. A single oral dose of captopril 0.64 +/- 0.04 mg/kg body weight was given to patients from group A and almost the same dose of captopril, 0.63 +/- 0.05 mg/kg body weight, to patients from group B. The patients remained sitting and BP was measured every 15 minutes during an hour. Blood for PRA was drown in the sitting position (17 patients from group A and 16 patients from group B) before and one hour after the dose of captopril. Samples of blood for basal PRA were collected from 16 patients from group A and in 14 patients from in B in lying position after waking up in the morning. PRA was measured by radioimmunoassay using a commercially available kit, SB-REN 2, from CIS Bio International. According to the criteria of Muller et al. [10] the captopril test was positive if the post-captopril PRA (ng/ml/h) was greater than or equal to 12 with an increase of greater than or equal to 10 and relative increase of greater than or equal to 15% (400% if initial PRA was < 3). The results of our study are presented in Tables 1 and 2 and in Graphs 1 and 2. The age of patients, doses of captopril, initial BP and PRA before the use of captopril did not much differ between studied groups. Fall of BP and PRA increase were highly significant (p < 0.001) both in group A and group B. However, the hypotensive reaction of diastolic BP and MAP were more pronounced in group A (14.45 +/- 1.67% and 15.81 +/- 1.62%) than in group B (6.95 +/- 2.21% and 8.96 +/- 1.75%; p < 0.01), but there were no significant differences in PRA and systolic BP changes and positive results of captopril test between the studied groups. Hypotensive responses of diastolic BP and MAP greater than 10% of initial values were found to be more frequent in group A (79.32% and 79.31%) than in group B (26.61% and 31.57 degrees %; p < 0.001 and p < 0.01).

Both primary, secondary and complex reflux were included. The reflux had disappeared in 90 of 133 refluxing ureters, the grade of reflux had diminished in 17 and were unchanged in 26 at the control three months after treatment. After re-STING in 22 reflux ureters, reflux disappeared in 13, was reduced in six and unchanged in three. Reappearance of low grade reflux was seen in eight of 88 ureters between the three months and one year control, but only one needed re-STING. Open surgery was performed in 13 patients (18 reflux ureters) because of unchanged reflux after STING, most of them due to complex reflux: duplex ureters, ectopic ureters, ureteroceles and paraureteral diverticula. It is concluded that most patients with vesicoureteral reflux can be successfully treated by using subureteric teflon injection."
CD010657,0,7609187,0,Regional renal blood flow measurements using radioactive microspheres in a chronic porcine model with unilateral vesicoureteral reflux.,"95Niobium labeled radioactive microspheres were used to determine regional renal blood flows in a porcine model of chronic sterile vesicoureteral reflux. Unilateral vesicoureteral reflux was surgically created in 5 mini-pigs and regional renal blood flows were determined by microsphere injection 6 months later. The contralateral nonrefluxing kidney acted as a control. There was a significant reduction of flow in the inner cortical regions of the middle (78% of control, p < or = 0.0437) and lower poles (69% of control, p < or = 0.0274), and the juxta-medullary cortical region of the lower pole (67% of control, p < or = 0.0124). There was no difference in flow in the other regions or when comparing whole kidneys. There were no differences between refluxing and nonrefluxing kidneys when comparing ratios of inner to outer cortical flow level by level. These observations are in contrast to those in acutely created vesicoureteral reflux in a porcine model, which had no significant differences in flow in any region using the microsphere technique. Decreases of blood flow in certain cortical regions may help explain some of the physiological changes in vesicoureteral reflux in children and experimental models of reflux."

Children with VUR who had been on antibiotic prophylaxis for at least 2 y and were free of urinary tract infections (UTI), had normal voiding patterns, and no hydronephrosis or new kidney scarring, had antibiotic prophylaxis discontinued, were followed up prospectively with urine cultures, voiding cystourethrography, and technecium-99m dimercaptosuccinate renal scintigraphy. The findings were compared with those of the same patients while they were on antibiotic prophylaxis. In 54 children (39 girls and 15 boys), antibiotic prophylaxis was discontinued. The mean follow-up time on and off antibiotic prophylaxis was 4.4+/-2.1 and 4.4+/-2.2 y, respectively. Nine UTI episodes occurred during the on- and 8 during the off-prophylaxis period.

The Teflon granuloma that occurs after the injection anchors the submucosal ureter, thereby preventing reflux. This paper reviews the ultrasound and cystographic findings in 88 patients with 115 refluxing ureters followed-up for periods ranging from 3 months to 3 years. Reflux disappeared in 91 ureters (79.1%) and the degree of reflux improved in 22 ureters (19.1%). In this follow-up study, the size of the granuloma on ultrasound was assessed in relation to the number of injections, the total volume of Polytef paste used and the outcome of the procedure. A well circumscribed granuloma was seen at the orifices of 92 ureters. There was no ureteric granuloma evident in 23 ureters and Teflon plaques were found at the trigone in six patients. Complications were rare. One large granuloma caused severe obstruction requiring re-implantation. The size of the granuloma appears to depend on individual tissue reaction rather than on the other factors. The presence or the size of the granuloma bears no direct relationship to the success of the procedure."

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of urinary tract anomalies and acute renal damage in neonates who presented with first urinary tract infection in the first 8 weeks of life. We reviewed the records of 95 infants, who were hospitalised with UTI during a 6-year period (1994-1999). Patients with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and incomplete radiological investigations were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 57 patients, 42 were boys and 15 girls. The mean age at diagnosis was 32 days (range 5-60 days). All patients underwent renal ultrasonography (US), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Urinary tract abnormalities were detected in 20 (35%) patients. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was found in 19 (33%) neonates, 7 girls and 12 boys. Acute cortical defects on DMSA scan were present in 19 kidneys of patients with VUR and in 25 of those without reflux. Only one-third of neonates after first symptomatic UTI had VUR. We recommend that US, VCUG, and DMSA scan should be routinely performed after the first UTI in infants younger than 8 weeks."
CD010657,0,12172760,0,ACE gene polymorphism and renal scar in children with acute pyelonephritis.,"The pathogenesis of renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children is multifactorial. In addition to well-known risk factors (young age, high grade of vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, and treatment delay), a role for genetic predisposition has been suggested. Since the ACE gene deletion polymorphism is a known risk factor for progressive glomerulosclerosis in chronic renal diseases, we have investigated the relationship between the ACE genotypes and the development of renal scarring after APN. Fifty-nine children (43 males and 16 females) with APN diagnosed by urine culture and technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99)Tc-DMSA) renal scan were studied. ACE genotypes were determined as II, ID, and DD using the polymerase chain reaction technique. A follow-up (99)Tc-DMSA renal scan was performed to evaluate the development of renal scars 3-6 months after treatment. The distribution of ACE genotypes and the allele frequencies were compared in the renal scar-positive ( n=39) and -negative group ( n=20). ACE genotype frequency after stratification by risk factors was also evaluated. The distribution of ACE genotypes did not differ between the renal scar-positive (II 25.9%, ID 35.9%, DD 28.2%) and -negative group (II 35.0%, ID 45.0%, DD 20.0%), before and after stratification by each risk factor.

CD010657,0,24659313,0,Voiding urosonography with second-generation ultrasound contrast versus micturating cystourethrography in the diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux.,"Vesicoureteric reflux has been associated with paediatric urinary tract infection. Fluoroscopic micturating cystourethrography (MCU) has been the gold standard of diagnostic test for decades; however, it has been criticized owing to its lower detection rate and radiation dose to children. Therefore, new radiation-free reflux imaging modalities have been developed, in which ultrasound-based contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS) is a good example. However, ultrasonography has been considered as an operator-dependent examination. Therefore, our study aimed to examine the inter-observer agreement of this sonographic technique, which has not been evaluated before. Moreover, the second-generation ultrasound contrast SonoVue has been recently marketed, and the data on its efficacy on intravesical use in ceVUS is relatively scarce. Thus, we also aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance and safety profile of SonoVue-enhanced VUS in the diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux. Our prospective comparative study compared the diagnostic performance of ceVUS with MCU in young children presenting with first episode of urinary tract infection. We performed sequential ceVUS and MCU examinations in 31 patients (62 pelvi-ureter units). Perfect inter-observer agreement (Cohen’s kappa statistics = 1.0, p < 0.001) was achieved in ceVUS, suggesting its good reliability in reflux detection and grading. Using MCU as reference, ceVUS had 100 % sensitivity and 84 % specificity and carried higher reflux detection rate than MCU (p < 0.001). There was no complication encountered. Conclusion: Voiding urosonography is a reliable, sensitive, safe and radiation-free modality in the investigation of vesicoureteric reflux in children. It should be incorporated in the diagnostic algorithm in paediatric urinary tract infection."

There were 9 simplex kidneys, the differential function was between 33% and 43% (mean 38%). On follow-up to date (mean 6.7 years) all kidneys show stable differential function with neither improvement nor deterioration. Only 8 children had a urinary tract infection.

The urinary excretion of the high molecular weight protein albumin was taken as an index of glomerular alterations and the excretion of retinol-binding protein (RBP), beta 2-microglobulin and brush border antigens (BBA) (measured by monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was taken as an index of tubular alterations. All such markers were increased in children with VUR and were related to the degree of renal function. Patients showing reduced creatinine clearance had very high levels of albuminuria, microproteinuria and BBA, with all these variables reciprocally correlated. In children with normal renal function however, only microproteins (not albumin or BBA) were slightly increased, thus indicating an isolated tubular defect without involvement of the proximal segment of the tubule. However, microprotein excretion did not correlate with the grade of scarring (99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan), both RBP and beta 2-microglobulin excretion being normal in 75% of children with radioisotopic signs of renal lesions but increased in 17% of children without scars. Therefore, tubular proteinuria identifies different groups of children with VUR but is not related to renal scarring. Prospective studies will define the usefulness of proteinuria as a reliable indicator of renal outcome."

CD010657,0,15705091,0,The role of indirect radionuclide cystography during the acute phase of pyelonephritis in young women.,"To review our experience using dynamic 99mTc-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid renal scintigraphy combined with indirect radionuclide cystography (IRC) in the acute phase of pyelonephritis, as a possible alternative to the conventional imaging, as investigating acute pyelonephritis usually includes imaging the upper urinary tract during the acute phase, to exclude obstruction, and delayed voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG) when underlying vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) is suspected."
CD010657,0,8361142,0,[Follow-up and prognosis of pyelonephritis in infancy].,"128 infants between 1 and 18 months, 80 girls and 48 boys suffering from their first pyelonephritis (PN), were investigated and followed up over 2.9 +/- 2.2 years (mean +/- SD). 20 children showed urinary tract obstructions. In 49 of 108 cases (45%) with nonobstructive PN a vesico-uretero-renal reflux (VUR) was found and surgically corrected in 13 cases. In 36 patients (52 renal units) the VUR disappeared in most cases under medical management within 3 years. Recurrences of urinary tract infections (UTI) were found in the same frequency in children with and without reflux (28%), but those with VUR showed significantly more PN. 22 of 108 patients with nonobstructive PN (20%) developed renal scars, 39% of children with reflux (mostly VUR III. or IV. degree), 5% of those without reflux. In more than half of these cases renal scars were found already after the first PN. We conclude that a reduction of the risk of renal damage and an improvement of the prognosis can achieved by the following measures: 1. early detection of obstruction by pre- or postnatal sonographic screening, 2. early and exact diagnosis of PN and antibiotic therapy without delay. PN has to be excluded in all infants with unclear fever. 3. In all infants with PN a voiding cystography should be performed. In children with VUR, long-term chemoprophylaxis is necessary to avoid recurrence of PN."
CD010657,0,9542222,1,[The utility of gammagraphy with Tc 99-labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in the protocol for studying urinary infection in a 2nd-level hospital].,Not all hospitals in our country have their own nuclear medicine laboratory. Most small and medium size hospitals must arrange their radioisotope studies with private clinics. The objective of this study was to assess if a single DMSA scan performed after an acute infection in a group of patients chosen according to certain risk criteria would allow the selection of those who run the risk of progressive renal damage.
CD010657,0,16585276,0,Urine interleukin-8 as a marker of vesicoureteral reflux in infants.,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common finding in children presenting with urinary tract infection (UTI) and prenatally diagnosed urinary tract dilatation and in relatives of index patients. Children with VUR are at risk for ongoing renal damage with subsequent infections. Detecting VUR and renal scarring currently depends on imaging modalities with associated problems of radiation, invasiveness, and expense. Noninvasive methods would greatly facilitate diagnosis and would also help in identifying relatives of index cases who should be screened. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is produced by epithelial cells of the renal tract in response to inflammatory stimuli and has been shown to increase during acute UTI. The objective of this study was to assess the urine levels of IL-8 as a noninvasive marker of VUR in infants in the absence of a recent UTI episode."
CD010657,0,23489509,0,Transurethral neo-orifice (TUNO) a novel technique for management of upper pole obstruction in infancy.,"Ureteral duplication is the most common urologic abnormality. The upper pole ureter can sometimes be associated with a ureterocele. In rare cases the ureteral insertion is extravesical and can result in significant hydroureteronephrosis. Patients can present with urinary tract infection, abdominal mass or urinary obstruction. Traditional procedures include ureteral reimplantation, ureteroureterostomy or heminephroureterectomy. These reconstructive procedures are technically challenging in small infants, especially when the hydroureteronephrosis is severe. In some cases a distal cutaneous ureterostomy is performed for immediate drainage followed by definitive surgery when the child is older. We describe our initial experience with a novel cystoscopic technique which provides drainage of the upper pole ureter and avoids the need for an incision or stoma."
CD010657,0,7218460,0,Early postoperative assessment of the functional patency of ureterovesical junction following ureteroneocystostomy.,"We studied 37 children soon after ureteroneocystostomy using diuretic radionuclide urography to assess the patency of the ureterovesical junction. Postoperative obstruction was excluded correctly in 90 per cent of the patients. Transient ureterovesical obstruction occurred in 5 patients, identification of which was useful in assigning risk and in guiding followup studies. Because it is a safe, noninvasive and relatively low radiation test the diuretic radionuclide urogram proves to be an attractive alternative to the excretory urogram in the early and late followup of patients undergoing a ureterovesical junction operation."
CD010657,0,12524941,0,[Contrast-medium enhanced reflux ultrasound in children. A comparison with radiologic imaging up to now].,"Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) has long been the method of choice for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Especially in the course of conservative treatment, the radiation dose involved might become quite high over the years. Since the development of such ultrasound echo-enhancing agents as Levovist (Schering, Germany), we now have the ability to assess the diagnostic efficacy of this agent in the evaluation of VUR with a view to replacing VCUG with the radiation-free ultrasound methodology. A total of 104 children with a mean age of 5.4 years were examined using echo-enhancing ultrasound after informed consent had been obtained from their parents. For control purposes, all children were examined by standard VCUG as well. The diagnosis of VUR was judged to be positive when microbubbles appeared in the ureter or renal pelvis. Correlations were sought between the sonographic findings and those obtained by standard VCUG. In 76 (37%) of the 208 ureter-kidney units investigated, VUR was detected by both technologies. VUR was diagnosed by ultrasonography only in 5 units and by VCUG only only in 3 units. All reflux grades (I-V) were identified. The specificity and sensitivity of the contrast reflux ultrasound were significantly high. The long contrast time of up to 30 min combined with the high contrast effect resulted in convincing images with high levels of diagnostic confidence. Our results clearly demonstrate that the safety and accuracy of the diagnosis of VUR by means of contrast-enhanced ultrasound is statistically comparable to those of standard radiologic VCUG. Therefore, this methodology is an exceptional approach to reducing the number of children being exposed to ionising radiation especially during conservative follow-up of children with reflux."
CD010657,0,12524945,0,"[Magnetic resonance tomography of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. Epidemiology, pathogenesis and symptoms].","Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare chronic infection of the kidney. In this overview article we reevaluated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of our four patients with histologically proven XGP and correlated them with the CT and ultrasound findings described in the literature. Additionally, we give an overview of the pathogenesis and epidemiology. The following criteria were found in MRI: hydronephrosis and/or urethral stricture, vesicoureteral reflux or neurogenic bladder depletion disorders, and calculus as the origin of urinary obstruction. Moreover, in contrast to normal pyelonephritis, XGP is accompanied by fatty deposits in the peripelvic parenchyma, which demonstrate contrast enhancement and form the typical so-called bear paw sign. As XGP is often accompanied by severe kidney failure, contrast-enhanced CT with nephrotoxic contrast agents should be avoided and MRI should be performed instead. Because of proven reduced nephrotoxicity of gadolinium chelates, MRI seems to be superior to CT in patients with suspected XGP. Essential for the correct diagnosis is consideration of the complete medical history including recurrent pyelonephritis to avoid malpractice."
CD010657,0,22649872,0,Postnatal evaluation and outcome of infants with antenatal hydronephrosis.,"This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical outcome of infants with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis. Our objective was also to determine whether there is a significant correlation between anterior posterior pelvic diameter (APPD) and urinary tract abnormalities detected. We retrospectively analyzed data of 145 infants collected between January 2000 and May 2010. Inclusion criteria were the presence of APPD > or = 5 mm on prenatal US scan after 20 weeks of gestation, at least 6-month follow-up and at least two postnatal US scans. Most patients underwent renal scintigraphy (n = 140, 96.6%) and micturating cystourethrography (n = 141, 97.2%). Of 145 infants, 77 (53.1%) had idiopathic or transient hydronephrosis. The second most common diagnosis was vesicoureteral reflux found in 21 (14.4%) infants, followed by ureteropelvic junction obstruction without significant kidney damage found in 18 (12.4%) infants. The relative risk of significant urologic abnormality according to the degree of antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) was 21.25 (95% CI: 2.95-156.49) for severe ANH, 1.57 (95% CI: 0.94-2.62) for moderate ANH and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.33-0.66) for mild ANH. There was a significant increase in the riskper increasing degree of hydronephrosis. In 19 out of 145 (13.2%) infants, immediate surgery was required. These data support the need of antenatal detection and long-term postnatal follow-up of infants with ANH."
CD010657,0,9922697,0,[Renal and urinary tract abnormalities in small children].,"The purpose of this study was to investigate frequency and pattern of urological abnormalities in children younger than two years of age in the county of Frederiksborg, Denmark, with a catchment area of about 350,000 people, and furthermore to investigate in which way the urological abnormalities were diagnosed. From 1994-1996 a total of 35 children younger than two years of age were found to have urological abnormalities. Fourteen patients had a ultrasonographical prenatally diagnosed urological abnormality, which was confirmed postnatally. Twenty-one children were diagnosed with urological abnormalities after presentry with their first urinary tract infection. The obstructive urological diagnoses: congenital hydronephrosis, congenital megaureter and posterior urethral valves made up to 57% (20/35) of the abnormalities. Nine boys were operated upon; three for unilateral hydronephrosis, two for posterior urethral valves, one for unilateral megaureter and three for phimosis. Two girls were treated with oestrogen for labial fusion. Urological abnormalities which were treated were found among the ultrasonographically diagnosed abnormalities, apart from phimosis and labial fusion. The frequency of urological abnormalities was 0.25% in children younger than two years of age in Frederiksborg county. In conclusion, in 1994-1996 the frequency and pattern of urological abnormalities in Frederiksborg county was in accordance with the figures in the literature. Urological abnormalities requiring treatment were diagnosed in 11 children; 55% (6/11) ultrasonographically and 45% (5/11) by examination of the external genitalia of children younger than two years of age at the time of the first diagnosed urinary tract infection."
CD010657,0,20578136,0,Holoprosencephaly and genitourinary anomalies in fetal methotrexate syndrome.,"Prenatal exposure to methotrexate (MTX) in the first trimester may lead to fetal death, and surviving children have increased risks for cranial dysostosis, dysmorphic facies, skeletal malformations, limb defects, growth retardation, and, in some cases, developmental delay, a pattern of defects recognized as fetal MTX syndrome (FMS). We report on a male infant who, in addition to severe FMS, showed previously undescribed central nervous system (CNS) and genitourinary anomalies that contributed to the further delineation. The propositus was born to a G2, 20-year-old mother with an irregular menstrual history. The unplanned pregnancy was complicated by oral MTX treatment (5 mg/day) for suspected systemic lupus erythematosus for 14 days at the 5th week post-conception, as dated by the first trimester sonogram. In addition to the typical features of the FMS, our propositus exhibited congenital penile curvature, vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, and severe CNS anomalies including semilobar holoprosencephaly (HPE). A single previous report of lobar-type HPE in an infant with FMS led us to confirm that the HPE observed in the propositus is a feature attributable to MTX teratogenicity, although the exact mechanisms of the HPE production need to be further elucidated. Also, this case serves to highlight the presence of genitourinary anomalies in patients with FMS, a fact that requires intentional searches in future patients in order to confirm this as being characteristic of the entity."
CD010657,0,23274271,0,Onabotulinumtoxin A for treating overactive/poor compliant bladders in children and adolescents with neurogenic bladder secondary to myelomeningocele.,"This retrospective study was performed to verify the efficacy and safety of Onabotulinumtoxin A (BTX-A) in treating children with neurogenic bladder (NB) secondary to myelomeningocele (MMC) with detrusor overactivity/low compliance. From January 2002 to June 2011, 47 patients out of 68 with neuropathic bladder were selected (22 females, 25 males, age range 5-17 years; mean age 10.7 years at first injection). They presented overactive/poor compliant neurogenic bladders on clean intermittent catheterization, and were resistant or non compliant to pharmacological therapy. Ten patients presented second to fourth grade concomitant monolateral/bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). All patients were incontinent despite catheterization. In the majority of patients Botulinum-A toxin was administered under general/local anesthesia by the injection of 200 IU of toxin, without exceeding the dosage of 12 IU/kg body weight, diluted in 20 cc of saline solution in 20 sites, except in the periureteral areas. Follow-up included clinical and ultrasound examination, urodynamics performed at 6, 12 and 24 weeks, and annually thereafter. Seven patients remained stable, 21 patients required a second injection after 6-9 months and 19 a third injection. VUR was corrected, when necessary, in the same session after the BT-A injection, by 1-3 cc of subureteral Deflux®. Urodynamic parameters considered were leak point pressure (LPP), leak point volume (LPV) and specific volume at 20 cm H(2)O pressure. The results were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. All patients experienced a significant 66.45% average increase of LPV (Wilcoxon paired rank test = 7169 × 10(-10)) and a significant 118.57% average increase of SC 20 (Wilcoxon paired rank test = 2.466 × 10(-12)). The difference between preoperative and postoperative LPP resulted not significant (Wilcoxon paired rank test = 0.8858) No patient presented severe systemic complications; 38/47 patients presented slight hematuria for 2-3 days. Two patients had postoperative urinary tract infection. All patients were hospitalized for 24 h with catheterization. Thirty-eight out of 47 patients achieved dryness between CIC; nine patients improved their incontinence but still need pads. Ten patients have resumed anticholinergic agents. Our results suggest that the use of BTX-A is safe and effective in patients with MMC with a positive effect on their dryness and quality of life."

CD010657,0,2557799,0,Serial 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans after urinary infections presenting before the age of 5 years.,"Forty five children presenting with a first proven urinary tract infection under the age of 5 years were studied by sequential 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans. Forty nine kidneys in 40 children had definite defects at presentation, and 39 (80%) of these defects were still present when the DMSA scan was repeated. Changes in the appearance of defects were independent of the presence or degree of reflux at presentation and of symptomatic recurrence of infection, though the combination of new infection and grade 3 reflux (reflux reaching the renal calices with distension) was associated with deterioration. No kidney with a relative DMSA uptake of less than 35% showed any improvement in its cortical defects. Only two kidneys that were initially without defects, in a single patient who had bilateral grade 3 reflux and breakthrough infections, developed defects on subsequent scans. The outcome after urinary tract infection is dependent on the effect of the first infection on the kidney. Occasionally children with grade 3 reflux develop damage during subsequent infections. More widespread use of DMSA scans should improve our understanding of the factors that determine the development of renal damage."

It does not involve exposure to contrast medium and radiation; low costs, minimal stress to the young patients, high diagnostic accuracy and easy reproducibility are further benefits. Postoperative follow-up of obstructive disorders can be easily performed and the results quantified by means of ultrasound. Morphometric data correlate well with renal function. As urologists become more familiar with ultrasonic morphologic and morphometric data, X-ray examinations in childhood will be confined to a few specific indications."
CD010657,0,22048628,1,The impact of therapeutic delay time on acute scintigraphic lesion and ultimate scar formation in children with first febrile UTI.,"We assessed the role of therapeutic delay time (TDT) in acute renal cortical scintigraphic lesion (ASL) and ultimate scar formation (USF) in children with first febrile UTI and whether it is affected by the presence of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR). 230 children, 90 girls and 140 boys with first febrile UTI were included. Radiologic (USG, DMSA, and VCUG), clinical (age, gender, peak fever, therapeutic delay time) and laboratory (CBC with differential count, ANC (absolute neutrophil count), BUN, Creatinine, urine analysis, gram stain, culture, CRP and ESR) variables were analysed. DMSA was performed within 5 days and after six months. VCUG was performed after acute phase of UTI. The differences in TDT according to the presence of ASL, USF and VUR were assessed. And the correlation between ASL or USF with the duration of TDT was assessed. Of 230 patients enrolled, 142 patients had refluxing UTI and 88 patients had non-refluxing UTI. TDT was the risk factor associated with ASL and USF along with presence of VUR. TDT was longer in ASL positive group compared with the ASL negative group. Also USF group showed longer TDT compared with those without USF in both refluxing UTI and non refluxing UTI. The TDT was significantly shorter in USF group with the presence of VUR. Positive linear association was noted between prevalence of ASL and USF and duration of TDT. In conclusion, the impact of UTI on formation of USF may be enhanced by the presence of VUR with shorter duration of TDT."
CD010657,0,1616829,0,Five-year study of medical or surgical treatment in children with severe reflux: radiological renal findings. The International Reflux Study in Children.,"The renal findings on intravenous urography (IVU) are reported in 306 children (73 boys, 233 girls) from eight European centres entered into an international study comparing medical and surgical management of children with urinary tract infection and severe vesico-ureteric reflux followed for 5 years. One hundred and fifty-five children were randomly allocated to medical and 151 to surgical treatment. Protocol and investigative techniques were standardised and randomisation, data collection and analysis were performed centrally in Essen, Germany. At entry 149 (49%) has established renal scarring (79 medical, 70 surgical). Children with normal kidneys (105), areas of thinned parenchyma (52) and grade of reflux were also evenly distributed. IVU was repeated at 6, 18 and 54 months and serial urine culture, 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans and plasma creatinine estimations were performed. Two hundred and seventy-two children (89%) completed this follow-up. In 174 children (57%), (90 medical, 84 surgical) there was renal growth without morphological change. New renal scars developed in 19 children treated medically and 20 surgically; 12 (5 medical, 7 surgical) developed in previously normal kidneys. Six followed post-operative obstruction. No significant difference in outcome was found between medical or surgical management in terms of the development of new renal lesions or the progression of established renal scars."
CD010657,0,15309597,0,Screening for vesicoureteral reflux and renal scars in siblings of children with known reflux.,"The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in the general population is less than 1%, but it is high in families with reflux. The reported prevalence of VUR among siblings of index patients with reflux has ranged from 4.7% to 51%. Reflux carries an increased risk of pyelonephritis and long-term renal impairment. The purpose of this study was to identify the age-related incidence and severity of reflux, and the frequency of associated renal parenchymal damage in siblings of children with reflux in order to assess the use of screening at different ages. Between October 1994 and February 2003, 40 siblings of 34 index patients were screened with direct voiding cystography. 99( m ) technetium (Tc)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) nuclear renal scans were performed in siblings with VUR to detect renal scarring. The cystograms were interpreted as showing the presence or absence of VUR and the DMSA scan as symmetrical or asymmetrical differential function, with or without renal scarring. Of 40 siblings, 17 had VUR, representing an incidence of 42.5%. The mean age at study entry of the 15 boys and 25 girls was 63 months (range 6 months to 12 years). The majority of siblings with abnormal DMSA scans were asymptomatic. Reflux was unilateral in 12 siblings and bilateral in 5. Of the 17 refluxing siblings (22 refluxing ureters), 7 (41.17%) had a history of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). The frequency of VUR was nearly equal in siblings over 6 years and those younger than 6 years. Of the 17 siblings with VUR, 16 had DMSA scintigraphy. Of these, 5 were normal and 11 (68.75%) showed abnormalities (7 asymmetrical differential function and 4 parenchymal defect), which was bilateral in 7 and unilateral in 4. In conclusion, this study confirms a significant overall incidence of VUR and renal parenchymal damage in the siblings of patients with known reflux. The prevalence of reflux in older siblings is similar to that in younger siblings. Our review suggests that all siblings over 6 years should undergo a screening cystogram, even in the absence of urinary tract infection. DMSA scintigraphy of asymptomatic siblings appears to be beneficial in preventing renal injury."
CD010657,0,8560356,0,[Unusual presentation of bilateral ureterocele in an adult Black male. Clinical case].,"Ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intra-bladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder. The abnormality leads to urinary retention and recurrent urinary tract infection which can cause irreversible damage to the kidney. Antenatal ultrasound diagnosis of ureterocele is possible but remains difficult. The disease is confirmed during radiologic examination after birth, and renal function is assessed by 99mTc-DMSA. Ureterocele, while not an uncommon pediatric urologic problem, has been reported only rarely in adults. It is bilateral in 10% of cases, is rare in black people, and requires thoughtful management decisions. A relatively uncommon case of bilateral ureterocele with single ureter, associated with left vesicoureteral reflux, in African black man is reported. The patient was investigated by ultrasonography and intravenous urography. Surgical transvesical right ""osteoplasty"" and excision of the left ureterocele plus ureteric reimplantation, using Politano-Leadbetter technique, were performed. The surgical approach to ureterocele is discussed and we underlined the difficulty of therapeutic decisions, especially if surgery is considered."
CD010657,0,2642358,0,Radiographic evaluation of subureteric injection of teflon to correct vesicoureteral reflux.,"The imaging studies of 83 children (115 ureters) with vesicoureteral reflux who were treated by subureteric injection of Teflon (STING) were reviewed. On plain films, the Teflon rarely may be seen as faintly radiodense. On sonography, it is echogenic and has variable acoustic shadowing. On CT it is dense (160-466 H). Postsurgical cystography showed cessation of reflux in 83 ureters (72%). Complications of STING were uncommon. No granulomatous masses were identified in the region adjacent to the STING. Transient, free peritoneal fluid developed in three children and ureteral dilatation in six, three of whom required intervention. In one child, most of the Teflon disappeared from the original site of injection, as noted on a follow-up CT scan; possibly it had been extruded into the bladder. The STING procedure probably will become more popular. Knowledge of its radiologic appearance is important for the radiologist in order to effectively evaluate these children postoperatively."

Prenatal ultrasound findings included bilateral hydroureteronephrosis; a large, smooth, thin-walled bladder, and normal volume of amniotic fluid. Postnatal studies demonstrated grades 4 to 5 bilateral reflux, a large bladder without obstruction and in 2 infants nonfunction of a kidney or renal moiety. Of 7 infants initially managed nonoperatively 5 have undergone surgery due to persistent reflux or breakthrough urinary infections. The prenatal diagnosis of the megacystis-megaureter association can be suspected with reasonable accuracy. Prompt postnatal continuous antibiotic prophylaxis and uroradiological confirmation allow for nonemergency management of this condition with excellent results."
CD010657,0,9280914,0,[Chronic renal failure secondary to vesicoureteral reflux: is the prevention possible?].,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the commonest cause of end-stage renal failure reported by the ITALKID (Italian Register of Chronic Renal Failure) (CRF) in children (0-15 years). Herein we report 131 children (53 M and 78 F) with a diagnosis of VUR made in our Centre between 1987 and 1994. Diagnosis was made in 69% of cases (85/131) during the 1st year of life and in 31% of cases (47/131) afterwards. VUR was demonstrated following a prenatal ultrasonography suspicion in 24/131 and after symptoms such as urinary tract infection (94/131) and poor growth (6/131). 75/131 of patients were treated conservatively (continuous chemoprophylaxis) while 56/131 underwent an antireflux surgery. CRF was found in 14% (19/131) of cases even though the diagnosis of VUR was performed in most of the cases (79%) during the 1st year of life. In conclusion prenatal ultrasonography has a low sensibility in the diagnosis of VUR. In addition, an early diagnosis made during the 1st year of life do not prevent CRF. The study was carried out in a Centre where patients with urological problems are referred from a large part of Northern East of Italy and this may explain the high prevalence of CRF and of children receiving a surgical treatment."
CD010657,0,20228505,0,Frequency of occurrence of vesico-ureteral reflux in kidney transplanted patients with the new technique of uretero-neo- cystostomy (Barry-Taguchi).,"There are several ways of performing vesico-ureteral anastomosis in kidney trans-plantation (Tx); they are broadly classified into two categories: extra-vesical and intra-vesical. Extra-vesical methods are preferred in kidney transplantation. In this study, we attempt to integrate two extra-vesical techniques of Barry and Taguchi and to evaluate the frequency of occurrence of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) with this technique. Also, an attempt is made to compare the results with other techniques reported in the literature. Fifty consecutive transplant recipients, who underwent uretero-neo-cystostomy (uretero-vesical anastomosis) by the new technique of Barry-Taguchi were evaluated for VUR by sonography and cystoureterography, six months after Tx. The mean age of the study subjects was 34.8 years; there were 33 males and 17 females. The mean time between Tx and evaluating for VUR was 6.6 months. Two cases of asymptomatic VUR (4%) were detected at the end of the study period. The occurrence of 4% asymptomatic VUR suggests that this technique is more acceptable compared to others. Because of the simple nature of the procedure as well as the short time required, this technique could be a suitable choice in kidney transplantation."

The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures."

Following a UTI there is concern with recurrences which can contribute to scarring which may lead to hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension and even renal failure in later years. Prospective studies using 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) have shown that 30%-40% of children will have renal scarring after febrile UTI, regardless of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Many studies have demonstrated that VUR is an important risk factor for renal scarring after UTI. Hypertension affects at least 10% of children with renal scarring, and in adults with reflux nephropathy (RN), the prevalence of hypertension is also much higher (38%-50%). UTI, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) or renal function deterioration alone or in some combination has been reported to be as high as 39% in women with renal scarring. RN is one of the important causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. Prevention of renal scar development should reduce the incidence of hypertension in patients as they age. The appropriate management of childhood UTI includes education of parents, patients and general physicians to be sure that everyone is aware of not only the current condition, but also the possibility of future UTI-related situations."

CD010657,0,17874139,0,Acute focal bacterial nephritis in 25 children.,"Acute focal bacterial nephritis (AFBN), formerly known as lobar nephronia, is a rare form of interstitial bacterial nephritis. Most often described in adults with diabetes, there is only limited knowledge of AFBN in children. Ultrasound shows circular hypoechogenic, hypoperfused parenchyma lesions, which may be misdiagnosed as a renal abscess or tumor. From 1984 to 2005, AFBN was diagnosed in 30 children at the University Hospital Münster and the General Hospital Celle, Germany. Data of 25 cases (14 girls, 11 boys) were available for retrospective evaluation. Twenty-five children with AFBN, mean age 4.5 years (range: 0.25-17.5 years), were followed up on average 4.2 years (range: 0.5-11 years). All children were admitted to hospital due to fever and rapid deterioration of clinical condition, initially suspected of having meningitis (four patients), urinary tract infections (five patients), renal tumor (three patients), pneumonia (two patients), appendicitis (one patient), or with only unspecific symptoms (ten patients). AFBN was diagnosed by ultrasound on average 3 days (range: 1-10 days) after onset of symptoms. Pyuria was found in 18/25 children, bacteriuria in 20/25 children, and hematuria in one patient. Blood cultures were negative in all but one patient. Urinary tract abnormalities were found in 12 children, including vesicoureteral reflux (8), megaureter (1), urethral valves (1), unilateral renal hypoplasia (1), and one patient with megacystis, megaureter, caudal dystopic left kidney combined with hypoplasia and dysplasia of the right kidney. High-resolution ultrasound showed AFBN lesions to have resolved completely within 12 weeks after onset of intravenous antibiotic therapy in 20/25 children. Renal parenchymal cysts remained in three cases and focal scarring in two. Blood pressure and renal function was normal in 24/25 cases. AFBN should be suspected in children with fever and rapid deterioration of clinical condition. Residual lesions such as cysts or scarring of renal parenchyma could remain."

CD010657,0,9173406,0,[The prenatal diagnosis and early endoscopic section of ureterocele].,"The endoscopic incision of ureterocele in children is still a controversial procedure. In two Departments of Pediatric Surgery, between January 1990 and December 1994, 47 patients (34 females, 13 males), for a total of 53 ureteroceles, underwent endoscopic incision of the ureterocele as the primary form of treatment; 41 ureteroceles were in duplex kidney. In 33 cases (70%) the prenatal ultrasound had observed hydronephrosis or duplex kidney or the presence of the ureterocele; these babies were free of urinary infection before treatment. 45 of the 47 babies were less than 6 months old at the time of the endoscopic incision. Vesico-ureteral reflux developed in none of the single systems, and in 32% of the duplex systems; however a preexisting reflux spontaneously disappeared in 41%. At 1 year follow-up the mean increase in renal parenchyma as evaluated at ultrasound was from 6.4 to 11.1 mm in single systems, and from 3.4 to 6.3 mm in duplex kidneys. Scintigraphy or urography showed a stable or improved renal function in all previously functioning units; 40% of the non-functioning units before section showed signs of function at 1 year follow-up. One to 3 years after section, 14 children underwent open surgery for persisting vesico-ureteral reflux, urinary infections or non-functioning unit: 9 ureteroneocystostomies and 5 heminephrectomies were performed. The endoscopic incision is proposed as the early first treatment of ureteroceles, mainly in cases of prenatal diagnosis, possibly performed in the neonatal age. In the Authors' experience it has been effective in preventing sepsis in all patients and in preserving the renal function of the involved unit; surgery has been avoided in over 60% of cases and when necessary it has been safely postponed after more than 1 year of age."

The first-choice technique for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux is voiding cystourethrography, followed by cystoscintigraphy; cystoscintigraphy, however, has the advantage of only minor irradiation of the patient, but it does not allow the morphological evaluation of bladder and vesicoureteral reflux grading. Colour-Doppler cystosonography with echocontrast is a recently introduced method for imaging vesicoureteral reflux. The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of colour-Doppler cystosonography with echocontrast in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Twenty children (11M, 9F) aged between 0.4 and 4.9 y underwent colour-Doppler cystosonography using a diluted solution of Levovist (Schering, Germany), after filling up the bladder with saline. In all patients, vesicoureteral reflux diagnosis and grading had been performed previously by voiding cystourethrography within 5 d from ultrasonography. Our data showed high accuracy in the detection of medium to severe vesicoureteral reflux (grades III-V), confirmed by radiological features in 9/9 patients. Conversely, in the 11 patients with mild vesicoureteral reflux (grades I-II), this technique showed extremely low sensitivity, allowing diagnosis in only four cases."

We have tested the sensitivity of ultrasound screening of the urinary tract. 1061 unselected newborn infants born during 1986 were examined by ultrasound and the findings were recorded on videotape. Babies with dilated renal collecting systems underwent further investigations (micturating cystourethrography, intravenous urography, or radioisotope study). With these methods, 11 children were found to have renal disorders. A postal follow-up survey was carried out when the children were 3 years old. 657 (62%) families responded. We searched for non-responders among children born in 1986 who had subsequently had a renal radioisotope investigation: 5 non-responders were found among these children. Of the total, 24 children had had a urinary-tract infection: 3 more children with ureteric reflux were found; their neonatal ultrasound scans had suggested no abnormality. Thus, more than half the children of this cohort in whom hydronephrosis or ureteric reflux developed had only slight dilatation (less than 5 mm) on the neonatal scan. On review of the original videotapes there was no difference in internal dimension between left and right kidneys: the internal dimension was 5 mm or less in both kidneys in 96.3% of babies and 4 mm or less in 93.3%. Routine renal ultrasound scanning of newborn babies is of no value in detecting those who may have ureteric reflux: the number of other renal abnormalities likely to be detected is small."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of VUS compared with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in the detection of VUR. One hundred and eighteen patients, aged 3 weeks to 16 years, with 234 ureterorenal units, were investigated by VUS with ultrasonography contrast medium and radiographic VCUG in one session. The indications were predominantly urinary tract infection and follow-up of previously detected VUR. During the sonographic examination, the bladder was filled with saline solution and an ultrasonography contrast medium (Levovist) was administered through a catheter. Reflux was diagnosed when echogenic bubbles were observed in the ureter or in the renal pelvis. Afterwards, conventional VCUG was performed. Concordant findings were obtained in 210 of 224 ureterorenal units (93.7%). Reflux was excluded by both methods in 174 units (77.7%). With the VCUG as the reference, the sensitivity of VUS was 90%, the specificity 94.6%, the positive predictive value 78.3%, and the negative predictive value 97.8%. The accuracy was 93.7%. In conclusion, VUS with ultrasonography contrast medium is a reliable diagnostic tool for the detection of VUR in children."
CD010657,0,21672365,0,The necessity of voiding cystourethrography in children with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis.,"The postnatal persistence of fetal hydronephrosis requires further evaluation to establish whether pathological abnormalities are present. This study determined the necessity for voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) to identify vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children (n = 195) with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis. Among the study population, the prevalence of VUR was 17.4% (24 males, 10 females). There was a poor correlation between the severity of hydronephrosis, ureteral dilatation, presence of bilateral hydronephrosis and presence of VUR. Except for the frequency of urinary tract infections and the presence of renal damage on (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans, VCUG was the only reliable method for confirming VUR in this study. The diagnosis of VUR is important for the early detection of renal damage. Further information is needed to develop the optimal approach to the evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis, with reliable parameters that avoid invasive procedures such as VCUG."

DMSA scans performed within 72 hours of presentation in 65 previously healthy children with acute urinary tract infection were abnormal in 34 (52%). The scan appearances of 30 of 36 (83%) initially abnormal kidneys improved or became normal on the repeat DMSA study performed at 3 to 6 months after the acute urinary tract infection. A cystogram demonstrated significant vesicoureteral reflux in 11 of 45 cases (24%). Of these 11 cases 10 had abnormal DMSA studies and 1 had dilated upper tracts on ultrasound. Several conclusions may be drawn from our study. The incidence of DMSA abnormalities at the time of acute urinary tract infection is high but these abnormalities tend to resolve with time. An abnormal DMSA study at the time of urinary tract infection identifies most children with significant vesicoureteral reflux, and in our series a combination of ultrasound and DMSA identified all cases. This study may have major implications for the clinical investigation of children with urinary tract infection."

CD010657,0,1314912,0,Renal scarring following reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis in children: evaluation with 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy.,"99mTechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is the imaging modality of choice for the detection of acute pyelonephritis and chronic renal scarring in children. Using the DMSA scan we prospectively evaluated renal scarring after reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis in children. The study population consisted of 33 patients with acute pyelonephritis documented by a DMSA renal scan at infection. The children were evaluated for renal scarring with a followup DMSA scan 4 to 42 months (mean 10.7 months) after the acute infection. All new scarring on followup DMSA scans occurred at sites corresponding exactly to areas of acute inflammation on the initial DMSA scan. Therefore, only those kidneys with acute changes on the initial scan were subsequently analyzed. Of 38 kidneys new or progressive scarring developed in 16 (42%), including 6 of 15 (40%) with associated vesicoureteral reflux and 10 of 23 (43%) without demonstrable reflux. New renal scarring developed in 6 of the 7 kidneys (86%) associated with a neuropathic bladder or posterior urethral valves. In contrast, new scarring developed in only 10 of 31 kidneys (32%) associated with a normal bladder (p = 0.028). Excluding the kidneys associated with a neuropathic bladder or posterior urethral valves, new renal scarring developed in 3 of 12 (25%) with primary reflux, compared with 7 of 19 (37%) without vesicoureteral reflux. Except for the white blood count and the species of infecting bacteria, no other statistically significant differences could be found between those cases in which scars did or did not develop. We conclude that acquired renal scarring only occurs at sites corresponding to previous areas of acute pyelonephritis, the acute parenchymal inflammatory changes of acute pyelonephritis are reversible and do not lead to new renal scarring in the majority of cases, and once acute pyelonephritis has occurred ultimate renal scarring is independent of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux."
CD010657,0,1331545,0,Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy for the evaluation of pyelonephritis and scarring: a review of experimental and clinical studies.,"Renal cortical scintigraphy has been reported to be useful in children for confirmation of the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Subsequent experimental studies have demonstrated that dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, when compared directly with histopathology, is highly reliable for the detection and localization of parenchymal inflammatory changes associated with acute pyelonephritis. Recent clinical studies of acute pyelonephritis using DMSA scintigraphy reveal that the majority (50 to 91%) of children with febrile urinary tract infections have abnormal DMSA renal scan findings and that the majority of these children do not have demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux. However, when vesicoureteral reflux is present, renal cortical abnormalities are demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy in 79 to 86% of the kidneys. In children with febrile urinary tract infections routine clinical and laboratory parameters are not reliable in the differentiation of acute pyelonephritis, documented by DMSA renal scan findings, from urinary tract infections without parenchymal involvement. Furthermore, the presence of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli associated with febrile urinary tract infections does not reliably predict those kidneys that have acute parenchymal inflammation demonstrated by DMSA renal scans. DMSA is also the isotope agent of choice for the detection of renal scarring. Clinical studies report greater sensitivity of DMSA renal scintigraphy for the detection of renal scarring when compared with the excretory urogram, particularly in infants and young children. In a recent prospective study of post-pyelonephritic renal scarring in children we found that acquired renal scarring only occurs in sites corresponding exactly to previous areas of acute pyelonephritis demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy at the time of infection. Furthermore, once acute pyelonephritis occurs, ultimate renal scarring is independent of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux. These findings provide convincing evidence that renal parenchymal infection, rather than vesicoureteral reflux, is the prerequisite for acquired (postnatal) renal scarring. Vesicoureteral reflux as a risk factor for acquired renal scarring is directly related to its role as a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis. We conclude that DMSA scintigraphy is a valid tool for confirming the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children and for identifying kidneys at risk for subsequent renal scarring."

The 64 infants, children and young adults ranged from 2 days to 28 years old (median age 2 years), and 28 were less than 1 year old. Intubation was used in only 4 patients: 2 who also underwent ureteral reimplantation for vesicoureteral reflux, 1 with stones in the renal pelvis and 1 with pyonephrosis. We successfully repaired 60 of 64 nonintubated renal units (93.4 per cent). Temporary postoperative ureteral stenting was required for extravasation from 8 renal units (12.5 per cent). Two patients later underwent repeat ureteropyeloplasty for recurrent obstruction. Nephrectomy was performed for pyonephrosis in 1 patient and for a nonfunctioning kidney that had exhibited poor function preoperatively in 1. Prolonged ileus necessitated extended hospitalization in 3 patients (4.6 per cent). We conclude that nonintubated dismembered ureteropyeloplasty for uncomplicated, primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction can be performed safely and successfully, and should be considered the standard treatment. Positioning of the Penrose drain is critical to avoid urinoma formation. When persistent urinary leakage occurs temporary diversion is easy and well tolerated. Hospital stay averaged 12.1 days for patients with extravasation compared to 4.3 days when no extravasation occurred. Immediate preoperative retrograde pyelography did not seem to contribute to postoperative urinary extravasation by causing edema of the ureteral orifice."

Sonography was done in all cases within 8 hours of a voiding cystourethrogram. Vesicoureteral reflux was documented in 272 of 986 kidneys on voiding cystourethrography and there were 201 refluxing kidneys with normal ultrasound (25 with grade I reflux, 119 with grade II, 50 with grade III, 6 with grade IV and 1 with grade V). In 71 of the refluxing kidneys the ultrasound was abnormal due to pelvicaliceal dilatation in 45, a duplication anomaly in 6 and renal fossae abnormality in 20. Of the kidneys with vesicoureteral reflux 74% were sonographically normal. Sonography was not sufficiently sensitive or specific for detecting vesicoureteral reflux, since 28% of the missed refluxing kidneys had grade III or higher reflux."

The data were collected prospectively between 1998 and 2010. Infants with a fetal pelvis diameter of >5 mm identified with antenatal ultrasound were followed-up. Body height and weight were expressed as HZ scores (observed height - median height/standard deviation) and WZ scores (observed weight - median weight/Standard deviation). The nutritional status was evaluated and the body weight was transformed to a weight-for-height index (WHI = weight/median weight for the height age × 100). The HZ and WZ scores or WHI were calculated for each patient at the first and last visits. The chi-square and Student's t tests were used for statistical analysis. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. The study included 178 (134 males, 44 females) patients. Of these, 29 were diagnosed by vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), 87 by obstructive uropathy, and 54 by normal. Of 134 males, 111 infants were circumcised. The mean monitoring time was 45±24.9 months and the mean age of circumcision was 14 ± 16.06 months. The pre-circumcision UTI frequency (2.97 ± 1.14/y) was significantly higher than post-circumcision period (0.25 ± 0.67/y) (p < 0.05). Also, pre-circumcision UTI frequency (2.97 ± 1.14/y) was significantly higher than the UTI frequency observed in female cases (0.85 ± 0.91/y) and in the overall study group (0.73 ± 0.79/y) (p < 0.05). In all patients, the HZ of the circumcised subjects (0.18 ± 1.01) was statistically higher than uncircumcised subjects (-0.26 ± 0.92) (p < 0.05). Although statistically insignificant, the HZ of the circumcised males (0.13 ± 1.24) with VUR was higher than the uncircumcised patients (0.03 ± 0.55) (p > 0.05). In obstructive uropathy groups, the HZ of the circumcised males (-0.13 ± 0.54) was also found to be higher than uncircumcised males (-0.49 ± 0.66) (p < 0.05). Although nutrition scores were found to be better in circumcised males, no statistically significant effect of circumcision on the nutrition status was detected. In conclusion, postnatal early circumcision of infants with AH seems to prevent frequent UTIs and nutritional disturbances enabling normal growth."

The time-dependent curves of changes in signal intensity observed in the renal cortex and renal medulla brought about by the paramagnetic contrast agent allowed insight into excretory kinetics. The time at which the cortical and medullary curves cross, the cortico-medullary (C-M) junction time, was delayed with a decrease in glomerular function. The mean C-M junction time in both kidneys showed a significant inverse correlation with total creatinine clearance (Ccr), indicating the glomerular filtration rate. The C-M junction time in an individual kidney also showed an inverse correlation with individual Ccr in each kidney. Results suggest that dynamic MR imaging is a useful tool in evaluating renal morphology and in evaluating semiquantitatively the glomerular function of the kidneys, singly and together, in a manner analogous to radionuclide scintigraphy."

Medical records of 103 male and 83 female infants with mean age at entry 5.97 months were reviewed. Diagnosis was established using radiographic voiding cystourethrogram. At diagnosis, a renal ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy were performed in all children. The follow-up included blood pressure measurements, serial urine cultures, haematological and biochemical tests, radionuclide cystography, renal ultrasounds and renal scintigraphy. The majority of infants with reflux, 176/186, presented with one or more episodes of urinary tract infections. In 113 children, reflux resolved spontaneously, 27 underwent surgical or endoscopic correction and 46 are being followed-up to date. Spontaneous resolution after prophylaxis was more frequent in boys (p < 0.0001), in children with grade I or II (p < 0.0001) and unilateral reflux at diagnosis (p = 0.0215). No significant difference could be established with respect to the presence of scars (p = 0.1680) and the number of breakthrough urinary tract infections (p = 0.1078).

CD010657,0,16025288,0,Postnatal management of infants with antenatally detected hydronephrosis.,"With the increasing use of antenatal sonography, fetal hydronephrosis has been reported more frequently. Because of the lack of consensus regarding treatment of these infants, the postnatal approach toward fetal renal pelvis enlargement remains controversial. The aim of this prospective study is to demonstrate the postnatal investigation, treatment, and outcome of infants with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis. Infants whose antenatal ultrasound scan showed a fetal renal pelvis of 5 mm or greater were investigated postnatally using ultrasound (US) and voiding cystourethrography. When indicated, isotope studies and intravenous urograms were also performed. We followed prospectively neonates with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and recommended management guidelines on the basis of our findings. In 156 neonates (193 kidney units) that were found to have hydronephrosis, the average gestational age at which the diagnosis was made was 32.94+/-5.10 weeks. The mean duration of postnatal follow-up was 26.3+/-13.56 months (range 3-60 months). The mean APPD of the fetal renal pelvis was 10.35+/-3.24 mm (5-9 mm in 84 kidneys, 10-14 mm in 96 kidneys and > or =15 mm in 13 kidneys). Of the 193 kidney units, 145 units were found to be pathological. The most common detected underlying abnormalities were ureteropelvic junction obstruction (in 91 kidneys; 62.7%) and vesicoureteral reflux (in 24 kidneys; 16.6%). Postnatally, 23 (45%) of 51 patients whose first US was normal were diagnosed postnatally as having urinary tract abnormality. There was a negative correlation between APPD and the rate of spontaneous resolution and positive correlation between APPD and the rate of surgery (P<0.01). In conclusion, because it is not possible to determine an upper limit of normal for the antenatal renal pelvis, any baby with AH should not be considered clinically insignificant. Infants with antenatal renal pelvis measurements > or =5 mm should be investigated postnatally. A normal postnatal ultrasound scan does not preclude the presence of urinary tract abnormality."
CD010657,0,2552216,0,[Evaluation of renal scarring in children with primary VUR by 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy].,"Renal scarring in 271 kidneys of 172 children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was evaluated by 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy. 58% of refluxing kidneys were with renal scar by the initial DMSA renoscintigraphy. Only 52% of these kidneys showed good correlation between the findings on IVP and DMSA renoscintigram. Of the 144 refluxing kidneys with normal IVP, 41% had renal scarring on DMSA renoscintigram. DMSA renoscintigram revealed widespread renal scarring in 28% of kidneys with only calyceal clubbing and in 60% of those with segmental cortical thinning on IVP. It is realized that IVP was an in-sensitive method to evaluate renal scarring of refluxing kidneys and such kidneys with segmental renal scar on IVP accompanies more widespread scar on DMSA renoscintigram. These cases were allocated to 2 age groups, younger than 3 years and older than 4 years. In the former group less than 10% of kidneys with low grade VUR and about 40% with high grade UVR had widespread renal scarring. On the contrary, in the latter group severe renal scar was recognized in more than 20% of kidneys with low grade VUR and in about 60% with high grade UVR."

In addition, it has been shown that VUR and UTIs are associated with renal scarring, predisposing to serious long-term complications, i.e., hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency and complications of pregnancy. Therefore, diagnostic imaging for the detection of VUR in the high-risk groups of children has been a standard practice. However, none of these associations has been validated with controlled studies, and recently the value of identifying VUR after a symptomatic UTI has been questioned. In addition, several studies have shown that renal damage may occur in the absence of VUR. On the other hand, some patients, mainly males, may have primary renal damage, associated with high-grade VUR, without UTI. Recently, increasing skepticism has been noted concerning how and for whom it is important to investigate for VUR. It has been suggested that the absence of renal lesions after the first UTI in children may rule out VUR of clinical significance and reinforces the redundancy of invasive diagnostic techniques. Therefore, the priority of imaging strategies should focus on early identification of renal lesions to prevent further deterioration."

In the district of the hospital the evaluated incidence of MK was 0.3 per 1000 live-born children. 12 of the patients were infants aged under one year. Two of these died soon after birth; one had severe extraurinary anomalies and the other had bilateral MK. The removal of MK was performed in ten cases. In ten operated and two autopsied patients the cystic dysplasia involved the kidney entirely. There was no discernible normal renal parenchyma and the ipsilateral ureter was always abnormal. On the opposite side one patient had a severe ureteric stenosis with hydronephrosis, and 4 patients had vesicoureteral reflux. Extraurinary anomalies were also common. Three patients had a significant cardiovascular abnormality. The accurate diagnosis could usually be obtained preoperatively. It was found that typical findings of physical examination, plain films, intravenous urography and B-mode ultrasound give sufficient information for accurate diagnosis to be made in most cases. Mictiocystography and endoscopy were required for associated urinary anomalies. Following the diagnosis, the removal of MK should be performed at the correct time, and also if asymptomatic, because these can become symptomatic later in life."
CD010657,0,8022020,0,An alternative approach to myelodysplasia management: aggressive observation and prompt intervention.,"We have adopted an approach to the management of myelodysplasia patients which is contrary to that most commonly supported by the existing literature. We screen patients shortly after birth with ultrasound, urine culture and serum creatinine, and then follow patients at 3 to 6-month intervals with similar studies. Cystography and urodynamics are done only as required clinically or by a change in the sonogram. Clean intermittent catheterization is indicated for continence or medical reasons. With this approach of aggressive observation and prompt intervention, we observed a rate of renal deterioration (diminished function on renal scan or parenchymal loss on imaging studies) of 5%. Renal deterioration was associated statistically with urinary tract infections and reflux. Patients started on clean intermittent catheterization for medical indications had greater risk for renal deterioration than those started on it for continence. Renal deterioration occurred with equal frequency between patients with abnormal and normal urodynamic studies, that is urodynamics did not predict renal deterioration. Our data show a rate of renal deterioration similar to other reports. We believe that aggressive observation with prompt intervention for problems once identified represents a reasonable alternative to managing patients with myelodysplasia."

The findings were: Most high-grade vesicopelvic refluxes were detected by both methods consistently. Discrepant results of high-grade vesicopelvic refluxes were seen in 6 kidneys from 4 children. Main advantages of RNVC are the quick results and the ease of interpretation of these results. In RNVC the whole urinary tract can be observed during the filling phase as well as during the voiding and postvoiding phase. In sonography, the different parts of the urinary tract must be explored one after another during the filling, voiding, and postvoiding phase. The investigation by sonography is time consuming and a strongly investigator-dependent procedure."

CD010657,0,21352744,0,[Postnatal evaluation and management of fetal pyelectasis on prenatal ultrasound].,"Fetal pyelectasis is the most frequently encountered anomaly on prenatal ultrasound. The ultrasound diagnostic criteria are well established: nature of dilated structures, degree of dilatation, ultrasound appearance of the kidneys, volume of amniotic fluid. Ultrasound can also determine if the anomaly is isolated or not, which is important for the management and prognosis of the pregnancy. Ultrasound is the initial postnatal study to evaluate the urinary tract. Further management will be based on suspected diagnosis. In cases of suspected vesico-ureteral reflux, VCUG is performed. In cases of obstructive uropathy or complex malformation (duplications), MRI is performed at 6 months of age to further define the anatomy of the urinary tract. Radionuclide renogram, performed in most cases, allows evaluation of split renal function. Follow-up ultrasound is important to monitor renal development, urinary tract dilatation and appearance of the renal parenchyma. Functional follow-up is assured by radionucline renography. This comprehensive follow-up is recommended to prevent complications and progressive loss of renal function."

The kidney length and echogenicity, the volume of the collagen, the mean length of the urinary jet, the longitudinal and transverse angles, and the distance between the origin of the jet and the midline of the bladder were measured 1 day, 1 month, and 3 months after SCIN and compared to the results of micturating cystourethrograms (MCUs) performed 3 months after SCIN. The collagen was hyperechogenic compared to the bladder wall at the time of injection, and was isoechogenic 1 and 3 months after SCIN. CDUS showed the relationship between the injected collagen and the position of the ureteral orifice. The measurements of jet length, angle, and distance of the ureteral orifice from the midline did not correlate with vesicoureteral reflux assessed by MCU. Although CDUS may demonstrate the location, the size of the injected collagen implant, and its relationship to the ureteral orifice, it is as yet unable to predict vesicoureteral reflux after SCIN."
CD010657,0,10452281,0,ACE I/D gene polymorphism predicts renal damage in congenital uropathies.,"We investigated angiotensin converting enzyme gene (ACE I/D) polymorphism as a risk for progressive renal damage in congenital uropathies. The ACE I/D genotype was determined in 196 Caucasian patients with congenital uropathies and 163 individuals with no clinical or sonographic evidence of any urological malformations. The study group included patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (n=49), primary obstructive megaureter (n=19), primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (n=67), and posterior urethral valves (n=27). Thirty-four patients were excluded because of additional diseases or insufficient follow-up. There was no difference in the ACE I/D distribution between children with uropathies and normal controls (II 16%, ID 56%. DD 28% vs. II 26%, ID 50%, DD 24%). Renal lesions were found in 99 of 162 children by ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography, and nuclear scans. In these children there was significant over-representation of the DD genotype (II 11%, ID 53%, DD 36%) compared with normals (P<0.005, X2=14.9) or with patients with uropathies but no renal lesions (II 23%, ID 62%, DD 15%, P<0.005, X2=14.9). Because ACE I/D has been linked with progressive deterioration of renal function, we evaluated a subset of patients with initially normal kidneys who developed radiographic renal lesions (n=28). Among these patients there was an even greater over-representation of the DD genotype (II 0%, ID 43%, DD 57%, P<0.001, X2=22.6) compared with patients with uropathies but no radiographic lesions. Multivariate analysis revealed that the DD genotype is a risk factor for parenchymal destruction, which was independent of time of diagnosis, surgical intervention, or urinary tract infection. This finding was particularly relevant in patients with VUR who constituted the majority with initially normal kidneys who developed radiographic damage (22/28). Indeed, the odds ratio of developing parenchymal damage with VUR was significantly increased if the individual had the DD genotype (4.2, 95% confidence interval 1.4-13.0). In conclusion the ACE I/D gene polymorphism is a risk factor for renal parenchymal damage in patients with congenital urological abnormalities and appears particularly relevant in children with VUR, where it is an independent predisposing factor."

Eight hundred thirty-seven patients were included in the study. Patients ranged in age from <1 month to 18.7 years, with a median age of 1.3 years. Five hundred sixty-nine were female and 268 were male. In this retrospective study, each patient underwent a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and a renal ultrasound examination. The presence of hydronephrosis and bladder filling status in 131 renal units with VUR grade IV or V was evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity for hydronephrosis to detect the presence of VUR grades IV and V were 60 and 92 %, respectively. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 74 and 87 %, respectively. Odds ratios for the relationship between hydronephrosis and severe VUR was significant (p = 0.046)."

A medical disease prediction may be viewed as a pattern classification problem based on a set of clinical and laboratory parameters. Probabilistic Neural Network models were assessed in terms of their classification accuracy concerning medical disease prediction. A Genetic Algorithm search was performed to examine potential redundancy in the diagnostic factors. This search led to a pruned ANN architecture, minimizing the number of diagnostic factors used during the training phase and therefore minimizing the number of nodes in the ANN input and hidden layer as well as the Mean Square Error of the trained ANN at the testing phase. As a conclusion, a number of diagnostic factors in a patient's data record can be omitted without loss of fidelity in the diagnosis procedure."

The present study is an analysis of the data collected over an 80-month period of 76 patients whose urinary tract malformation was suspected prenatally and confirmed after birth. Patients with lethal malformations whose disease led to abortion or intrauterine death were excluded. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction was present in 47% of the patients and obstructive uropathy accounted for 67% of all malformations. In contrast, vesicoureteric reflux was found only in eight patients. Thirty seven infants (49%) required surgical intervention and 61% of all operations were performed during the first month of life. 57% of these early interventions were temporary diversions. The indication for surgical treatment was based on sonographic and radiological assessment of the malformation and on the results of functional assessment. In many instances surgery was delayed until indicated on the basis of the findings of the follow-up studies. All reconstruction operations were successful. Prenatal diagnosis benefitted most children, especially those with the most severe malformations. No patient died as a result of the renal condition and the prognosis is grave in only one child, who is likely to go into terminal renal failure in childhood."

It represents a rare sex chromosome aneuploidy syndrome. Some consider it as the most severe variant of Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY). The approximate incidence is 1 in 85,000 male births. The karyotype arises from maternal non-disjunction during both meiosis I and meiosis II. The clinical presentations of 49, XXXXY syndrome include mental deficiency, hypogonadism, severe speech delay, multiple skeletal anomalies, cardiac defects and characteristic facial features. It might be mistaken for Down syndrome and needs chromosome analysis for confirmation. According to literature review, urinary tract anomaly in association with 49, XXXXY syndrome was extremely rare.

We describe the case of boy with congenital anomalies in urinary tract including bilateral double collecting system, dilatation of double collecting system in the right kidney and dilatation of lower pelvis in left kidney and bilateral dilatation of ureters. Anomalies were detected in prenatal and then confirmed in postnatal ultrasonography. Voiding cystourethrograhy, which was performed on the 4th day of life revealed grade IV vesicoureteral reflux to the lower part of double collecting system in the right kidney and grade V vesicoureteral reflux to the left kidney. In cystoscopy posterior urethral valves were excluded and presence of double ureters was confirmed. Dynamic scintigraphy (99mTc-EC) detected impaired parenchymal secretory function in the lower pole of left kidney. The patient was qualified for surgical treatment including left lower heminephoureterectomy. Before surgery procedure computed tomography urography was performed and revealed congenital anomalies in urinary tract: bilateral double collecting system, bilateral hydronephrosis of the lower part of kidneys, dilatation of ureters associated with high grade of vesicoureteral refluxes, narrow cortex of left kidney. Computed tomography urography with iterative reconstruction techniques enables precise visualization of urinary tracts with reduced radiation dose. It replaces conventional X-ray urography because of much better visualization of urinary tracts with comparable or even lower radiation dose."

Seventy-four infants with pyelonephritis, 44 girls and 30 boys (mean age at their first pyelonephritic episode 4.12 months, median 3 months), were enrolled in the study. Voiding cystourethrography (VCU) and ultrasonography (US) were performed within 6 weeks following the infection. DMSA was performed at least 4 months after the urinary tract infection (UTI). The renal parenchymal pathology was defined as focal or multifocal defects or as a split renal uptake of less than 45%. DMSA scintigraphy revealed that 19% (14/74) of the children had renal damage. Renal parenchymal findings were observed only when VUR was present, and its grade was above 3/5. No abnormality was found in 51 renal units without reflux, 9 with VUR grade 1/5, and 54 with grade 2/5. Renal pathology was observed in 9/24 renal units with VUR grade 3, 3/8 with grade 4, and 2/2 with grade 5. No correlation was found between renal parenchymal defects and clinical presentation of the pyelonephritis, type of the microorganism, presence of bacteremia, or the number of recurrent infections. In adequately treated infants, renal damage is probably due to a reflux-associated, preexisting, congenital renal parenchymal pathology and not to the inflammatory process. We suggest that DMSA scintigraphy should not be performed routinely in every infant with UTI and should be reserved primarily for children with VUR grade 3 and above."

Urological examinations were ultrasonography of bladder and kidney, voiding cystourethrography (VCG), and urodynamic cystometry. In those of them, 6 patients had already had urinary dysfunction at preoperative stage, but 4 patients' spinal lipoma was one complication of cloaca exstrophy and 2 patients' spinal lipoma after repairment of their myelomeningocele. In the remaining 30 cases, 18 patients (60.0%) as the group 1 did not have urinary dysfunction and abnormality in any urological examinations. Another 7 patients (23.3%) as group 2 also did not have urinary dysfunction, but abnormal vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was found out in their VCG examination. At postoperative stage, abnormal VUR resolved or improved in all these 7 cases, but one of them showed transient urinary retention. Two patients of 18 in the group 1 had to require clean intermittent self-catheterization at postoperative stage. These observations confirmed that children with spinal lipoma were more likely to present with urological findings, and so it was imperative that a diagnosis be made and treatment be instituted as early as possible."

Their ages ranged from 3 to 13 years. The authors used a complex of methods for the examination of the functional condition of the kidneys, upper urinary tract (excretory urography, renoscintigraphy, electroureterography, clearance tests), lower urinary tract (cystography, cystoscopy, cystotonometry, urethroprofilometry, electromyography of the detrusor and its obturator apparatus), bacterio- and immunological studies (determination of the microbial number, bacteria covered with antibodies, immunoglobulins G, A, and M). The results of the study were analysed in 3 groups in which VUR was linked with normoreflexia (33.3%, group 1), hyperreflexia (48.6%, group 2), and hyporeflexia (18.1%, group 3). There was an obvious growth of cystitis incidence in patients with bladder dysfunction. The data of computed scintigraphy showed partial renal dysfunction in patients with unilateral VUR not only on the side of the affection but also in the contralateral intact kidney. It is assumed that there is a clear relation between the degree of renal dysfunction, the ureteral motor activity, and bladder dysfunction. The treatment included: (1) pharmacotherapy of neurogenous bladder dysfunction with belladonna preparations (in hyperreflex) and aceclidine (in hyporeflex urinary bladder) in optimization of the organism's bioenergetic processes; (2) percutaneous bladder electrostimulation; (3) combination of the listed methods together with cerucal.

Renal scarring is an important cause of chronic renal failure and hypertension in children. Effective prevention necessitates an early diagnosis of urinary tract pathology. The aim of this work was to examine renal morphology and function in VUR using radioisotope techniques and to compare the sensitivity of the planar technique and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of renal scarring. The following examinations were performed in 45 children with VUR: ultrasonography, renoscintigraphy with technetium-99m-etylenedicysteine (EC-Tc-99m) or technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-Tc-99m) in planar and SPECT modes. The stage of VUR correlated with cortical lesions as reflected by effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and scarring as shown by static scintigraphy. The use of SPECT increased diagnostic sensitivity in the case of small and isolated scars. Thus, SPECT would be recommended in children at risk of renal scarring. The correlation between ERPF and DMSA scintigraphy findings supports the use of EC-Tc-99m renoscintigraphy to monitor the process of renal scarring."

A routine karyotype analysis showed 7 fetuses with chromosomal defects. Nine cases with isolated bilateral urinary tract dilatation underwent pelvic fetal urine sampling in order to assess antenatal renal function. The 142 cases comprised 107 children born alive (group I) and 35 intrauterine fetal deaths (group II). In group I, 79 kidneys had a transient pyelectasis, and 11 kidneys had a hydronephrosis which disappeared at postnatal examination. Among 103 pyelectasis cases detected during the second trimester of pregnancy, 22 kidneys were pathological after birth (positive predictive value (PPV) = 21.4%) with 17 ureteropelvic junction obstructions. The PPV was 66% when ultrasound showed hydronephrosis at the end of pregnancy. In that group, 15 cases had vesicoureteric reflux, with 5 cases where the homolateral upper urinary tract was morphologically normal in utero.

Further controversy stems from management of the underlying pathology. This article first discusses the patient characteristics that are important in the evaluation of pediatric patients with UTIs, and the indications for screening tests (such as voiding cystourethrograms, ultrasound, dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy, and intravenous pyelography). Following this, the author reviews what is known about three controversial aspects about the management of these patients. First, although the role of the prepuce in pediatric UTI is well established, the role of routine circumcision is not. Second, the natural history and etiology of antenatally detected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has provoked us to view the concept of ""primary reflux"" in a new light.

The current diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux involves voiding cystourethrograms, which are invasive and costly. Consequently, vesicoureteral reflux screening in siblings and offspring is not routinely practiced, because of the known high risk. Early detection of vesicoureteral reflux will be valuable for prevention of reflux nephropathy, because the incidence of reflux nephropathy can be reduced effectively by antibiotic prophylaxis. Furthermore, the presence of reflux nephropathy can only be accurately assessed currently by dimercapto-succinic acid nuclear scans, which are costly, time and labor intensive, and often require conscious sedation by a pediatric anesthesiology team. As a result, the clinical assessment of reflux nephropathy is also not routinely practiced. There is a pressing need to develop less invasive and less costly tests for the early diagnosis of primary vesicoureteric reflux and reflux nephropathy. Recent molecular and genetic studies have greatly increased our understanding of vesicoureteral reflux and provide a promise of novel non-invasive tests. Targeted disruption of angiotensin type II receptor and uroplakin III genes result in the phenotype of primary vesicoureteral reflux. There are characteristic patterns of message and protein changes in the knockout animals, providing the basis for detection of genetic mutations leading to vesicoureteral reflux in humans by studying differential gene expression by functional genomics methodology. The urothelium is also known to secrete proteins into the urine. Preliminary studies showed unique fingerprints in urinary protein patterns in children with primary VUR, providing the basis for developing novel noninvasive molecular diagnostic tests of vesicoureteral reflux by proteomics methodology."
CD010657,0,3540885,1,Ultrasonography as a screening procedure in children with urinary tract infection.,"Renal ultrasonography, excretory urography and radionuclide-voiding cystography or conventional voiding cystourethrography were performed in 76 children with urinary tract infection. Forty children had functional or anatomical abnormalities. Twenty-eight children had vesicoureteral reflux and 12 children had an obstructive lesion. All 12 children with obstructive lesions as well as 4 children with reflux and hydronephrosis required corrective surgery. Ultrasonography as the initial procedure detected 14 of these cases and the other 2 were discovered in voiding cystourethrography. Our data and those in the literature suggest that renal ultrasonography may be the method of choice in children with urinary tract infection. This is followed by voiding cystourethrography or radionuclide-voiding cystography. Excretory urography is not necessary in the initial evaluation of these patients, but it should be utilized when the other imaging methods show an abnormality and more detailed anatomical visualization of the upper urinary tract is required. Using this protocol in children with urinary tract infection, unnecessary radiation, discomfort and expense will be avoided."
CD010657,0,16427220,0,Management of neonatal hydronephrosis.,"Management of neonatal hydronephrosis is a clinical challenge. The natural history of hydronephrosis has shown that most resolve spontaneously; however, there are a significant number that do not. Although hydronephrosis does not always mean obstruction, it becomes the clinician's role to determine when obstruction will eventually lead to renal damage. Work-up of hydronephrosis diagnosed prenatally starts with a postnatal ultrasound. Using the Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) grading of hydronephrosis based on ultrasonography, a management and treatment algorithm can be constructed. Other studies include a voiding cystourethrogram to evaluate for vesicoureteral reflux or in severe cases of bilateral hydronephrosis to evaluate for posterior urethral valves. Diuretic renography is useful in many cases to evaluate the degree of obstruction and determine differential renal function. The goal is to select the patients who would benefit from early surgical intervention. To achieve that goal, aggressive observation is often required."

As regards the management of these cases, 109 vesico-ureteric reimplantations were performed, 83 using Cohen's technique and 26 using Leadbetter's associated in some cases with a unicornous bladder. The results were excellent except in patients presenting with a severe renal insufficiency. Radical surgery was required in twenty cases.

CD010657,0,8142221,0,Clinical outcome and follow-up of prenatal hydronephrosis.,"Between 1987 and 1991, 160 hydronephrotic kidneys were diagnosed prenatally and confirmed postnatally in 100 infants. The aim of the study was to describe the natural history and management of primary hydronephrosis detected prenatally. We devised a new classification of obstructive uropathy outcome using ultrasonography and the diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid scan. Accordingly, we classified the patients as having mild, moderate or severe hydronephrosis. Nine patients had pyeloplasties and 5 had ureteric reimplantations. We conclude that in most cases there is no need for immediate surgery, and that the initial approach to the management of congenital hydronephrosis should be conservative. We suggest that anti-bacterial prophylaxis be conventionally given to infants with vesicoureteral reflux and for the first 6 months of life to infants demonstrating moderate to severe newborn primary hydronephrosis."

CD010657,0,24969214,0,Primary vesicoureteral reflux in Sudanese children.,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common congenital renal tract anomaly in children. Reports from Sudan are scanty. We report the characteristics, presentation and outcome of primary VUR in a tertiary care hospital. The records of 30 patients (16 males; 53%) followed-up between January 2004 and December 2010 were reviewed. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 4 ± 3.9 years and 47% were <2 years of age. Renal ultrasound scan (USS) failed to predict VUR in 17% of the patients. On voiding cysturethrogram (VCUG), VUR was bilateral in 57% and severe grade in 64%. Grades were not significantly associated with age, gender or site of VUR. Initial dimercaptosuccinic acid radionuclide scan showed renal damage in 61.5% of the patients. Renal damage was significantly associated with female gender and severe VUR, but not with age of onset or history of urinary tract infection (UTI). Thirteen patients (43.3%) presented with acute UTI, eight (26.6%) with non-specific urinary tract symptoms and nine (30%) with persistently elevated serum creatinine. Urine cultures were positive in 73% of patients, and E. coli was the most common pathogen. Renal impairment at presentation was significantly associated with bilateral severe VUR and history of UTI but not age or gender. After a mean follow-up period of 1.78 years (6 months to 5 years), 70% of patients remained with normal renal function and 30% progressed to chronic kidney disease; two of them died. In conclusion, our data is different from many studies. Features of primary VUR in Sudanese children are late age of onset, equal gender affection and predominance of severe grade. Presentation is associated with a high rate of UTI, renal damage and advanced renal impairment. Measures to improve early detection and treatment of VUR may reduce the risk of kidney damage."

Our investigation focused on the associated urological abnormalities, particularly on the contralateral side, and the results of voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). Four of the seven patients (57%) had urological abnormalities other than MCDK: three exhibited vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) of the contralateral side including one patient who also had an ipsilateral ectopic ureter, and the fourth patient had a ureterocele of the ipsilateral side. The results indicate that contralateral VUR, was the most common abnormality associated with MCDK. Two infants had high-grade VUR and underwent anti-reflux surgery soon after the diagnosis. Both have remained free of recurrent urinary tract infection."

CD010657,0,10961818,0,UTI: diagnosis and evaluation in symptomatic pediatric patients.,"We retrospectively reviewed data on 260 hospitalized pediatric patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). To ascertain the colony-forming units (CFU)/mL compatible with the diagnosis of UTI, a culture from a catheterized urine specimen containing >1,000 CFU/mL was considered diagnostic of UTI and resulted in imaging by renal ultrasound, voiding cystourethrography, and renal nuclear scan with Tc99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). A positive DMSA renal scan is indicative of pyelonephritis. We used logistic regression analysis to determine which patient characteristics were predictive of pyelonephritis. We determined that, in hospitalized pediatric patients, the colony count of the positive urine culture, the type of organism grown in culture, and the voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) result (positive or negative for vesicoureteral reflux) did not predict which patients had pyelonephritis. In females, advancing age of the patient and positive renal ultrasound results were predictive of which patients had pyelonephritis when we controlled for other factors. We feel this emphasizes the importance of a thorough evaluation of hospitalized symptomatic patients, including patients with colony counts of 1,000 to 50,000 CFU/mL, to locate the level of infection and plan appropriate therapy."

CD010657,0,10588266,0,Diagnosis of vesico-ureteric reflux.,"The demonstration and grading of reflux is crucial in examination and follow-up of any child with upper urinary tract infection. A variety of factors can influence the occurrence of reflux, e.g. race, genetics, state of maturation of the ureterovesical valve, diuresis, infection and bladder dysfunction, including obstruction and neurogenic disorders. Even when reflux is investigated under strictly standardized conditions, two consecutive bladder fillings frequently show different grades of reflux. Voiding cystourethrography is, to date, the only method with a generally accepted, well-defined grading of reflux. It also allows detection of intrarenal reflux and anatomical and functional information about the bladder and urethra that is unobtainable by other methods. It is therefore usually considered the method of choice. Radionuclide cystography and, possibly, contrast enhanced ultrasonography can be complementary to voiding cystourethrography, but mainly for postoperative follow-up and screening of siblings."

CD010657,0,2374215,0,The effect of back closure on detrusor function in neonates with myelomeningocele.,"To determine the effect of back closure on the detrusor-external sphincter coordination, we reviewed the medical records of 40 neonates with myelodysplasia studied prospectively with urodynamic assessment and renal ultrasonography before closure of the spinal defect, within 7 days of closure and at 3-month intervals thereafter. Only 31 of the 40 neonates met all criteria for inclusion. All renal sonograms were normal before and after closure. Urodynamic evaluation demonstrated coordinated detrusor-sphincter activity in 18 neonates before and after closure. During prolonged followup 1 patient had detrusor areflexia and 4 had detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Of 11 neonates who demonstrated detrusor areflexia and no external sphincter activity before closure 10 were unchanged on initial post-closure evaluation (4 had detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia during followup), while 1 demonstrated detrusor areflexia with external sphincter overactivity and vesicoureteral reflux after closure. The latter patient subsequently had detrusor hyperreflexia, more severe reflux and upper tract deterioration. She was temporized with a cutaneous vesicostomy. One patient demonstrated detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia before closure and detrusor areflexia with no external sphincter activity after closure, the consequence of surgical division of the neural placode during back closure. The remaining patient demonstrated detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia before and after closure. This patient had coordinated detrusor-sphincter activity during followup. Those neonates who presented with or later had detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia were managed initially with neuropharmacological agents and clean intermittent catheterization. An unsuccessful outcome was managed by cutaneous vesicostomy. Our study demonstrates that neonatal closure of the spinal cord defect does not appear to affect detrusor-sphincter coordination adversely, and re-emphasizes the need for careful and regular followup in children with myelodysplasia to detect deterioration of the urinary tract."
CD010657,0,10588269,0,Vesico-ureteric reflux and other risk factors for renal damage: identification of high- and low-risk children.,"This article reviews the literature with respect to various risk factors for permanent renal damage in children with urinary tract infection. Vesico-ureteric reflux is an important risk factor, but renal damage can occur in the absence of reflux. Renal damage does not always occur in the presence of gross reflux. Renal scars always develop at the same site as a previous infection in the kidney. Recurrent pyelonephritis and delay in therapy increase the likelihood of renal damage, although it is not known how long a delay is dangerous to the human kidney. Recent studies using 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy have not confirmed the findings of previous studies showing that children below 1 y of age are more vulnerable to renal damage. It is more likely that all children run the risk of renal scarring in cases of acute pyelonephritis. The role of bladder pressure is still not entirely understood. Therefore more studies are needed in order to determine the relationship between high voiding pressures in some, otherwise healthy, children with urinary tract infection and renal scarring. The importance of bacterial virulence in the development of renal scarring is unclear. DMSA scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography are the most reliable tools for identifying children at risk of renal scarring. As a single method DMSA scintigraphy appears to be better than voiding cystourethrography."

CD010657,0,16110405,0,[Obstructive uropathy in childhood].,"""Obstructive uropathy"" is a generic term which combines different diseases in infants and childhood. Both the upper and lower urinary tract may be affected. Diseases of the urinary tract can cause an intrinsic obstruction. Sometimes tumours may cause a compression and as secondary effect an obstruction (extrinsic). Ultrasound is the key diagnostic tool and shows dilatation of the obstructed urinary tract. But for the functional exploration of babies and toddlers, renal scanning and X-ray examinations are necessary. These examinations lead to an exposure to radiation which necessitates careful indication. Some of the congenital diseases (for example ureteropelvic junction obstruction, megaureter) show a maturation without any intervention. So one has to decide whether to wait and see or to operate. A percutaneous nephrostomy or a DJ-catheter is not often used in the treatment of obstruction in general. These forms of drainage are more often used in the treatment of stones or of extrinsic obstruction. A pyelocutaneostomy or ureterocutaneostomy is a special surgical procedure in pediatric urology for transient drainage of the upper urinary tract (megaureter). The operation of a seriously ill new-born should be done in a centre for pediatric urology and pediatric nephrology. When the upper urinary tract is dilated, patients may need an antibiotic prophylaxis, because the dilatation of the upper urinary tract increases the risk of urinary tract infections (UTI). The indication for antibiotic prophylaxis should by guided by the criteria of the APN-Consensus Paper. Long-term follow-up is necessary and should comprise ultrasound, physical examination, controlling the blood pressure, urine analysis and blood tests. The aims of diagnostics, treatment and long-term follow-up are the preservation of renal function and to protect the children from UTI. This goal must be reached under conditions that are appropriate for children and their parents."

In a series of 64 consecutive children with urinary tract infection in whom an intravenous pyelogram, renal ultrasound, and voiding cystogram were performed, only one treatable abnormality (calyceal dilation) was identified by intravenous pyelogram, and it was not detected by ultrasound. Eleven children showed vesicoureteral reflux on the cystogram. In an additional 43 children in whom intravenous pyelogram was done only if the ultrasound or cystogram were abnormal, there were five abnormal cystograms. Four treatable abnormalities were identified by ultrasound, and there were confirmed by the intravenous pyelogram. Ultrasound should replace the intravenous pyelogram in children with a normal cystogram because of its accuracy, safety, and high patient acceptance.

There was no significant relationship between the severity of hypoplasia and the presence or absence of obstruction. Severe acquired cortical loss was found in 68 of 86 patients. There was no significant association between the severity of cortical loss and the presence or absence of obstruction, age at nephrectomy or degree of coexisting hypoplasia. The findings suggest a strong association of hypoplasia and vesicoureteral reflux. Therefore, early postnatal presentation with minimal renal function need not necessarily reflect a failure of management but rather a pre-existing limitation of renal capacity. Furthermore, in a significant proportion of fetuses with ultrasonographic evidence of urinary tract abnormality, renal pathology may be present prior to the time at which in utero surgical intervention may be considered."

CD010657,0,7981167,0,Duplex ureteroceles: is radical surgery always necessary?,To answer the question about the best therapeutic procedure in duplex ureteroceles a prospective and retrospective study was performed. In a first group we summarized the patients operated from 1971 to 1986. These infants and children were compared to a group operated from 1987 to 1992. In the first group the operative procedure was chosen according to the presence or absence of reflux into the lower pole system. All patients with reflux were corrected radically in one operation. The control showed a reoperation rate of 45% (8 of 18 patients). 3 patients lost a functioning renal unit. In the second group the operative procedure was chosen according to the function of the upper pole. It was resected if its function was below 10% measured by DMSA-scintigraphy. In cases with functioning upper pole a pyeloureterostomy was performed. Only in two cases the ureterocele was resected primarily. In this group a second operation was necessary in only 3 of 16 patients and renal function was preserved in all cases. Our results show that radical surgery in duplex ureteroceles is seldom necessary and a staged procedure is the method of choice.

A retrospective study of the records of 415 children, which comprised renal function tests, radiology and scintigraphy, confirmed the value of the radioisotope technique. Graphs of height, kidney uptake and kidney uptake density in relation to age were established, showing highly significant correlations with renal function tests and intravenous urography results, but many dissociations were encountered. Separate renal function evaluation by radioisotope scintigraphy seems to be more reliable than evaluation extrapolated from measurement of the cortical areas at intravenous urography. In vesico-ureteral reflux scintigraphy makes it possible to detect reflux nephropathy at an earlier stage than with other methods."

Seven of the cases were associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and two with congenital hydronephrosis. These anomalies have been already treated surgically before entering this study. DMSA renal uptake rate of 8 children was the same as that of the controls (51.8 +/- 3.7%; mean +/- SD). However, the uptake rate of 10 cases were more than 2SD below the mean of the controls. In five of them, including two children with no other urinary tract anomaly, the uptake rate was less than 70% of the mean of the controls. Half of 14 children evaluated with alpha 1-MG showed high values. In 6 of these 7 cases, DMSA renal uptake rate was more than 2SD below the mean of the controls. Urinary microalbumin was not correlated with urinary alpha 1-MG or DMSA renal uptake rate. Three of 4 children with high values of urinary microalbumin were more than 10 years old. Nine of 12 children evaluated with all the indices mentioned above showed high values of urinary alpha 1-MG and/or microalbumin. Low DMSA renal uptake rate was revealed in 7 out of these 9 children including two cases without urinary tract anomaly. These results indicate that, in the cases with solitary kidney even though no other urinary tract anomaly is recognized, renal overload may have already developed in early life."

Total renal clearance of DTPA was calculated with a disappearance curve derived from the largest extrarenal area in the field of view of a gamma camera with diverging collimator. Split renal function was estimated with the slopes of second phase renograms. The plasma disappearance clearance of DTPA, calculated using one compartment model with two late blood samples, gave similar results with the clearance estimated from the body disappearance curves. The proportional planimetric renal parenchymal areas had good correlation with the split clearance estimated from renogram slopes. The method offers data on renal function and urinary tract dynamics which is very valuable in the follow-up of children with recurrent urinary tract infection and vesicoureteric reflux."

The purposes of this retrospective study were (1) to assess the relationship between DRF obtained during acute pyelonephritis and at follow-up, and (2) to elucidate the value of initial DRF in predicting subsequent renal scars. A total of 47 children were enrolled. All had both unilateral acute pyelonephritis diagnosed by initial DMSA renal scans, and follow-up DMSA renal scans. We found the correlation between initial and follow-up DRF poor (adjusted R2 = 0.396). Whether or not renal scars developed determined the follow-up DRF. Vesicoureteral reflux was significantly more common in children who developed renal scars. In addition, the higher the grade of vesicoureteral reflux, the lower the follow-up DRF and the improvement in DRF. When using a DRF of 46% as the cut-off value to predict subsequent renal scars, the sensitivity and specificity were 47.8% and 83.3%, respectively. Owing to the low sensitivity, initial DRF is not suitable for predicting the occurrence of renal scars."

There were 61 girls and 33 boys, with nine girls and 17 boys aged less than 1 year, 31 girls and nine boys aged between 1 and 5 years, the remaining 28 children were over 5 years of age. All children had a micturating cystourethrogram and a 99mTc (technetium) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Forty two of the 188 kidneys were scarred and 70 of the kidneys had VUR. Only 37.1% of the kidneys with reflux were scarred but 61.9% of the scarred kidneys had VUR. In children of less than 1 year, 48% of kidneys with VUR were scarred whereas 70.6% of scarred kidneys had reflux. In children between 1 and 5 years of age only 36.4% of kidneys with VUR were scarred but 63.2% of scarred kidneys had VUR. There is good correlation between the detection of a scarred kidney on DMSA and the presence of vesicoureteric reflux. However the detection of reflux particularly in children over 1 year of age shows poor correlation with renal scarring. This suggests that the primary imaging in children over 1 year of age presenting with a urinary tract infection should be of the kidney: a cystogram should be performed only if the DMSA scan is abnormal."

CD010657,0,19237812,0,Causes and outcome of prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis.,"Hydronephrosis is the most common abnormal finding in the urinary tract on prenatal screening with ultrasonography (U/S). Hydronephrosis may be obstructive or non-obstructive; obstructive lesions are more harmful to the developing kidneys. The aim of the study was to evaluate the causes of renal pelvic dilatation and the outcome of postnatal treatment in infants with hydronephrosis diagnosed prenatally with U/S. We prospectively studied 67 (60 males) newborns with hydronephrosis diagnosed prenatally and confirmed postnatally with U/S from Sept. 2005 to Oct. 2007. The patients were allocated to three groups based on the mea-surement of the anteroposterior renal pelvic diameter (APRPD) in transverse plane: mild (6-9.9 mm), moderate (10-14.9 mm) and severe (> or =15 mm) hydronephrosis. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was obtained in all of the patients to rule out vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). In cases with negative VUR, Diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) scan with diuretic renography was performed to detect ureteropelvic joint obstruction (UPJO). Twenty two cases (32.8%) had mild, 20 (29.9%) had moderate, and 25 (37.3%) had severe hydronephrosis. The causes of hydroneph-rosis were VUR (40.2%), UPJO (32.8%), posterior urethral valves (PUVs) (13.4 %), and transient hydronephrosis (13.4 %). The lesion was obstructive in 37 (55.2%) infants. Totally, 33 (49.2%) patients with hydronephrosis (9 mild, 9 moderate, and 15 severe) subsequently developed com-plications such as UTI and renal insufficiency, or required surgery.

CD010657,0,19282698,0,Hirschsprung disease and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT): a novel syndromic association.,"Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) can be associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Based on the common genetic background of enteric nervous system and kidney development, the reported association of CAKUT and HSCR seems underestimated. Therefore, we designed a prospective study aimed at determining the prevalence of CAKUT in HSCR patients and at identifying RET, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and GDNF family receptor alpha1 (GFRalpha1) mutations or haplotypes associated with this subset of HSCR patients. Eighty-four HSCR patients consecutively admitted to our department between July 2006 and July 2007 underwent interviews, notes review, ultrasound screening (further investigation according to detected anomaly), urinalysis, and DNA extraction for molecular genetics study. Another 27 patients with isolated CAKUT were included as a control group for the molecular genetics study. Twenty-one patients (25%) with HSCR had associated CAKUT, with hydronephrosis and hypoplasia being the most frequent diagnoses. Nine of 21 CAKUT were symptomatic. Six additional patients had other non-CAKUT anomalies (for example, stones, Barter syndrome) that were excluded from association and molecular genetics analysis to avoid bias of inclusion criteria. RET mutations were found in 5 patients (4 HSCR, 1 HSCR + CAKUT, 0 CAKUT) and GDNF mutations in 3 (2 HSCR, 1 CAKUT, 0 HSCR + CAKUT). No GFRalpha1 mutations were found. Finally, the HSCR-predisposing T haplotype of RET proto-oncogene was found in 64% of HSCR, 50% of HSCR + CAKUT, and in 24% of CAKUT patients. The incidence of CAKUT in HSCR patients is 4- to 6-fold higher than expected. Therefore, a patient with HSCR has a 3- to 18-fold higher risk of developing a CAKUT, particularly hydronephrosis or hypoplasia. If we consider that the proportion of predisposing haplotype in HSCR + CAKUT patients resembles that of other syndromic HSCR, we can conclude that HSCR + CAKUT has to be considered a novel syndromic association. These results need to be confirmed in a larger series. At present, we strongly suggest considering ultrasound screening of the urinary tract in every patient with a diagnosis of HSCR."

The past decade has seen significant advances in radiopharmaceutical design and instrumentation. It is expected that the next decade will produce an even greater advance in this field."
CD010657,0,16898507,0,[Serum TGF-beta1 level in children with reflux nephropathy].,"Reflux nephropathy is a progressive renal scarring due to chronic pyelonephritis developing in patients with vesico-ureteral reflux. TGF-beta1 is thought to be one of the most important factor that initiates reflux nephropathy and stimulates its progression. The purpose of the study was to assess serum TGF-beta1 level in children with reflux nephropathy. The study comprised 36 children (12 boys and 24 girls) aged 1-17 years with vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring confirmed by scintigraphic evaluation. In most children recurrent urinary tract infections were observed. In 13 (27.8%) children, a first episode of urinary tract infection occurred in infancy. Primary vesico-ureteral reflux was diagnosed in 18 (50.0%) children. Secondary vesico-ureteral reflux due to anatomic or functional subvesical obstruction were recognized in 11 (30.6%) and 7 (19.4%) children, respectively. Serum TGF-beta1 levels were measured by ELISA. The mean serum TGF-beta1 level in children with reflux nephropathy was significantly lower than that in controls (92.04 +/- 33.14 ng/ml vs 141.73 +/- 45.38 ng/ml). This might be a result of increased influx of serum TGF-beta1 into renal parenchyma and/or increased urinary TGF-beta1 excretion due to tubular damage in children with reflux nephropathy."

CD010657,0,2645564,0,Intravenous pyelography in children with urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux.,"In a previous study of the radiologic evaluation of children with urinary tract infection it was recommended that IVP be performed in all patients with either abnormal ultrasonographic or voiding cystourethrographic findings. However, the benefit from IVP was believed to be questionable in children with normal ultrasonography findings and vesicoureteral reflux of only a low grade (I or II of V). To gain a better understanding of the need for IVP in the radiologic evaluation of such children, the database was expanded and the findings concerning ultrasonography and IVP were analyzed in 52 children with urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux seen during the last 3 years. Of a total of 72 instances of reflux, 44 (61.1%) were of low grade (I or II), 14 of medium grade (III), and 14 of high grade (IV or V). Of the 44 urinary systems with low-grade reflux, results were as follows: renal ultrasonography appeared normal in 38 and in 34 of these, the IVP also appeared normal; in the other four, only minor and negligible changes were seen with IVP. Surgical intervention was not necessary in any of these 38 urinary systems. In six systems with low-grade vesicoureteral reflux but with abnormal ultrasonography findings, IVP results were also abnormal, and surgery was necessary in two instances. Of the 14 urinary systems with medium-grade reflux, ultrasonography appeared normal in ten but in six of these the IVP appeared abnormal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Familial clustering and renal hypodysplasia phenotypes observed in transgenic animal models suggest a genetic contribution. Uroplakin IIIa (encoded by UPIIIA) is an integral membrane protein present in urothelial plaques, and the murine UPIIIa knockout is associated with urothelial anomalies and vesicoureteral reflux. De novo UPIIIA mutations recently were identified in 4 of 17 patients with severe bilateral renal adysplasia."
CD010657,0,7776433,0,Pyeloplasty improves renal function and somatic growth in children with ureteropelvic junction obstruction.,"We studied the systemic effects of pyeloplasty in 38 children with unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Mean patient age at surgery was 2.5 years and 22 patients were age 1 year or younger. Mean followup was 18 months. We recorded serum creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate calculated by the Schwartz formula body growth, the degree of dilatation and the excretory curve of the diuresis renogram. Pyeloplasty was effective in decreasing the degree of ultrasonographic dilatation and the excretory curve of the renogram in 36 cases. Two patients required reoperation. Individual renal function improved significantly in children younger than 1 year with preoperative differential function less than 45% but not in older children. Serum creatinine level decreased significantly after pyeloplasty in all children. Likewise, glomerular filtration rate improved significantly in all children. Preoperatively, 72% of children younger than 1 year were below the 50th percentile in height. The distribution of heights became normal after surgery. Overall, percentile rank for height increased in a significant number of patients of all ages. We conclude that unilateral hydronephrosis systemically affects body growth and overall renal function, the salutary effect of pyeloplasty goes beyond the affected kidney and pyeloplasty may be of greater benefit when performed in infancy. These parameters must be considered in protocols designed to compare outcomes in children with hydronephrosis treated surgically with those who are simply observed."

These children did not have hydronephrosis, renal failure or urinary tract obstruction. In all cases both studies were conducted within a 10-month period. The findings from both modalities were in agreement for 51 of the 64 renal units evaluated (80 per cent). Evaluation of the excretory urogram indicated 6 cases of diffuse and 2 of focal scarring that were not detected by evaluation of the renal scan. The sensitivity of excretory urography to detect renal scars was 84 per cent and the specificity was 83 per cent. The 99mtechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan showed 5 cases of focal renal scarring not detected by excretory urography. The sensitivity of the renal scan to detect renal scars was 77 per cent and the specificity was 75 per cent. We conclude that neither study alone could effectively replace the other for the detection of renal scars, and recommend that both be included in the initial evaluation and followup of patients with renal scars."
CD010657,0,15134223,0,[Urinary tract infections in children].,"The diagnosis of urinary tract infections is based on the number of colony-forming units that grow on the culture media. The criteria for the diagnosis depends on the method of collection: clean void and bags > 10(5)/mL; transurethral catheterization > 10(4)/mL. The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis or cystitis is based on clinical and biological signs: unexplained fever, abdominal pains, signs of neonatal infections, elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive or sedimentation rate. After an urinary tract infection, it is important to look for a lithiasis, an obstructive uropathy, a vesico-ureteral reflux and a bladder dysfunction. The child should have a sonogram and a voiding cystourethrography. In case of cystitis the antimicrobial therapy is given orally. In case of pyelonephritis, most of the time the treatment is initially administered parenterally for 3 days and then completed by a 10-day antimicrobial course orally. In a child over 18 months of age who is not toxic appearing without severe uropathy, the antimicrobial therapy can be initiated orally."

CD010657,0,7681890,0,[Studies on reflux nephropathy--renal tubular and glomerular damage evaluated by various urinary indices].,"Measurements were performed on beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG), alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha 1-MG), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as indices of renal tubular damage and microalbumin as an index of renal glomerular damage in 204 cases with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Investigations were made on the relationship between each index and extent of renal cortical damage from the findings of 99mTc-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) renoscintigraphy, and also on the changes of each index before and after antireflux operation. At the first examination, high values of urinary beta 2-MG, alpha 1-MG, NAG and albumin were noted in 36%, 40%, 50% and 34% of cases with VUR respectively. Almost all the cases with high indices values before the operation showed improvement in those values accompanied with disappearance of VUR after the operation. These findings suggest that renal tubular and glomerular damage were induced by the sterile reflux itself. High values of urinary indices were confirmed in 16% (beta 2-MG), 40% (alpha 1-MG), 27% (NAG) and 32% (albumin) cases after a lapse of 2 years or longer since antireflux operation or spontaneous disappearance of VUR. In some of these cases indices values showed some improvement but have not returned to normal levels, and in other cases indices were within normal limits preoperatively but turned out to be high levels during the observation period even after the disappearance of VUR. Most of these cases were accompanied with severe cortical damage of unilateral or bilateral kidneys on DMSA renoscintigraphy. Based on these findings, we suggest that overload to residual nephron, caused by reduced mass of functional nephron, is playing an important role on raising the values of various urinary indices."

He was presented due to repeated seizures over previous 3 days. The patient was born after 40 weeks of gestation with birth weight of 2930 g, and was the first-born baby of healthy Korean parents. Hypoparathyroidism was first noticed due to seizure. A multicystic left dysplastic kidney and vesicoureteral reflux were detected by ultrasound after birth.

In infants and young children they may be easily overlooked because of nonspecific symptoms. This leads to an underestimation of their true prevalence. The severity of these infections is a function of the balance between the various host defense mechanisms and the virulence of the microorganism. The assessment of symptomatic infants and children requires a complete radiographic evaluation (renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram), because of the high frequency of anatomic abnormalities, particularly vesicoureteral reflux. The major issues in the management of children with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections are whether a single dose or short course of therapy is as efficacious as the conventional 7-10 days, and whether asymptomatic bacteriuria requires treatment."

Severe tortuosity and dilation of the upper urinary tracts in the presence of progression of hydronephrosis or a persistently elevated creatinine may favor a proximal urinary diversion rather than primary valve ablation or cutaneous vesicostomy. Because of a persistently elevated serum creatinine, a nonfunctioning kidney with grade 4/5 vesicoureteral reflux and worsening contralateral hydronephrosis despite lower tract drainage, a left cutaneous pyelostomy was performed, contralateral to the kidney involved with VURD. Postoperatively the serum creatinine stabilized at 1.0 mg/dl and decreased to 0.3 mg/dl at one month of age."

Sixty-two children were reinvestigated approximately 2 months later when intravenous urography (IVU) and micturition cysto-urethrography were also performed. During infection, 92% of the children showed changes in the DMSA scan with 69% by US, and the two investigations agreed in 58% of the kidneys. At follow-up, 68% showed changes in the DMSA scan, 47% by US and 48% by IVU. The DMSA scan and IVU agreed in 60% of the kidneys. Twenty-nine percent of the children had vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). The presence of grade greater than or equal to 3 VUR was associated with greater defects on the DMSA scan during infection, and at follow-up with a higher frequency of persistent changes compared with no VUR (P less than 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). During infection the size of the defect on the DMSA scan correlated with renal volume and C-reactive protein and inversely with the glomerular filtration rate, and at follow-up it correlated inversely with the renal concentration capacity. The DMSA scan is a sensitive method for diagnosing and localizing APN in children, and findings on DMSA scan show a weak but significant correlation with routine clinical and radiological parameters. It is suggested that persistent renal damage after APN in children without VUR may be more common than previously assumed."

About 85% of the patients had positive Tc99-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and 58% had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Kidney sonography aided in the diagnosis and treatment in 10% of the patients. Age, sex, presence or laterality of VUR did not contribute to defective DMSA scan (pyelonephritis) (P > 0.05). Delayed diagnosis and treatment of febrile UTI is associated with a high incidence of positive findings of DMSA scan irrespective of age, sex or presence/absence of VUR. In mild VUR, the DMSA scan may be normal while in patients with moderate and severe VUR the DMSA scan is almost always abnormal. Thus, our study shows that a normal DMSA scan can help in ruling out moderate to severe forms of VUR and that cystography remains an excellent and standard tool for the diagnosis of VUR."
CD010657,0,22089776,0,The safety and efficacy of endoscopic incision of orthotopic ureterocele in adult.,"Endoscopic incision is a good management option for orthotopic ureterocele. But most of the literature has shown its efficacy only in children. We have done this retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic incision of orthotopic ureterocele in adults. From March 2004 to January 2008, at our center, 26 adults underwent transurethral, transverse incision of an ureterocele. The perioperative data of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. The literature was reviewed to identify all the reported options for management of this relatively rare condition in adults. Unilateral ureterocele was present in 24 patients and two patients had bilateral ureterocele. One patient had associated upper tract stones. Three patients had associated stones in ureterocele. Transurethral, transverse incision of ureterocele was given in all patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 50.5 h. Twenty-three patients were available for follow-up at three, six and 12 months. All patients were symptom free. At three months ultrasound and intravenous urography revealed no residual ureterocele but four patients showed residual hydronephrosis, but with a decrease in the grade indicating decompression. Micturating cystourethrography revealed vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) in two patients and the reflux persisted in one patient even at 6 months. We conclude that in adults, management with endoscopic incision of orthotopic ureterocele is safe and effective. VUR may occur in a few cases."
CD010657,0,1572017,0,[Vesicoureteral reflux: a familial study].,"In order to assess the familial incidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) the authors examined a group of 54 families of children treated on account of this disease. Genealogical analysis revealed the same defect in two parents (1.8%), i.e. mothers and in five siblings (7.6%). Other urological abnormalities were found in 11 (6.3%) grade I relatives of children with VUR. Screening of the kidneys was made in 156 (91%) of grade I relatives. VUR was thus revealed in three siblings, incl. one where it was detected prenatally. In 18 families further abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary pathways were detected. Most frequently it was duplication of the urinary pathways which was detected in 12 grade I relatives (7%). The authors diagnosed furthermore: in mothers once right-sided hydronephrosis, once a dystopic kidney with pyelonephritic changes, once sponge kidneys, twice kidneys altered by pyelonephritis. The finding of hitherto clinically not manifested abnormalities which were thus revealed in 21 (12.1%) grade I relatives leads to the recommendation of ultrasound screening of the kidneys in families with VUR. The presence of VUR in eight (12.3%) siblings indicates the important role of genetic factors in the development of this defect."

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has proven increased sensitivity over planar scintigraphy for lesion detection in the heart, liver and brain. However, its role in the evaluation of renal cortical defects compared to planar scintigraphy has not been fully assessed. We wished to determine whether SPECT increases the sensitivity for detecting renal cortical defects in children compared to high-resolution planar scintigraphy. Forty-one children (90 renal units) with underlying vesicoureteric reflux and/or recently treated urinary tract infection (UTI) were evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of defects detected between a single-head SPECT system and high-resolution planar scintigraphy, 24 and 20, respectively (P = 0.54). There were four defects detected by SPECT not reported by planar scintigraphy; two of these were only seen retrospectively on planar scintigraphy. There were two children with renal cortical defects detected by SPECT and not by planar scintigraphy. All defects defected by planar scintigraphy were detected by SPECT. It is concluded that although the risk of missing renal cortical defects is low when using high-resolution, three-view planar scintigraphy, SPECT should be employed whenever feasible. Single photon emission computed tomography detected renal cortical defects in children not diagnosed by planar scintigraphy and hence patient management may be altered."

The positive study rate for renal defects depended on the severity of VUR. The overall positive rates for renal cortical defects obtained by DMSA SPECT imaging and DMSA planar imaging were 60% and 43%, respectively, and the difference between these was significant (p less than 0.005). The mean absolute individual renal uptake (/injected dose) at 2 hours post-injection was decreased in kidneys with defects detected by SPECT alone. The positive study rate for intravenous urography (IVU) depended on the grade of VUR and was 15% overall. DMSA SPECT imaging detects renal cortical defects at greater frequency than previously achieved."
CD010657,0,16397077,0,Vesicoureteric reflux and urinary tract infection in children.,"An association between vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and renal damage was found in 1960. In 1973, the term reflux nephropathy (RN) was first used to describe the renal damage caused by VUR. Follow up studies show that about 10%-20% of children with RN develop hypertension or end stage renal disease. It is now evident that there is a sex difference in the development of RN. In most males with RN, the kidneys are congenitally abnormal. In females it is an acquired condition, the most severe damage being sustained by recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The purpose of current UTI guidelines is to identify VUR or any other abnormality of the urinary tract. Since the advent of routine antenatal ultrasonography, there is no longer a need to identify an abnormality of the urinary tract after the first reported UTI. Routine investigations are not required. Recurrent UTIs and a family history of VUR need further evaluation. There is also an urgent need to establish the long term value of prophylactic antibiotics in children with VUR."

Three children (age range 6-9 years) reported here illustrate some physiological features of micturition readily seen only on IRC.

In 99 a micturating cysto-urethrography and in 83 an intravenous urography was also done. The occurrence of fever and increased WBC count, CRP and ESR were also studied. It appeared from this retrospective study that 47% of the kidneys had a cortical or patchy pattern of decreased uptake of 99mTc DMSA, as compared to 23% with abnormal findings on US. Vesico-ureteral reflux was present in 38% of the kidneys with parenchymal involvement on 99mTc DMSA scan. Although fever, leucocytosis and elevated CRP and ESR were significantly correlated with abnormal 99mTc DMSA scan, they were also observed in children without renal parenchymal involvement. Our results suggest that 99mTc DMSA scan is a sensitive method for the detection of parenchymal involvement during acute UTI. The exact nature of these lesions and their relation with scars need, however, to be defined."

Study and conclusions].,"Since uropathy started to be diagnosed by means of ultrasonography during the prenatal period, paediatric urologists have experienced a major increase in neonatal consultations, which involve healthy children without any symptoms of urinary tract infection. Thereby the criteria for an adequate treatment of these uropathies have been modified. With our study, we intend to analyse the changes regarding the management of such cases in our Service for the last 10 years. 294 cases prenatally diagnosed and confirmed by means of postnatal sonography have been reviewed, taking into account the type of explorations carried out in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Ultrasonography, cystourethrography, pyelography, scintigraphy and isotopic renography have determined both degree of obstruction and the renal function of the patient so as to value the kidney viability. We have found 169 cases of pelviureteral junction (PUJ) obstruction, 52 of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), 48 of megaureter, 13 of ureterocele, 8 of ectopic ureter, 5 of urethral valves, 26 of multicystic dysplasic kidney, 35 of renal duplication, 4 of renal cyst, 2 of ectopic kidney, 2 of renal agenesia, 3 of bladder diverticular, 1 of renal hypoplasia and 1 of Bolande's tumour. 32 children were operated upon due to PUJ obstruction, 27 due to VUR, 14 megaureter, 21 due to ureterocele and ectopic ureter, 5 due to valves, 5 multicystic kidneys, 3 vesical diverticula, 2 renal cysts and 1 due to Bolande's tumour. From a total of 367 diagnoses, 109 patients have undergone an operation, which equals a 29.7%. The rest of the patients have been subject to a medical follow-up. Only 3 patients had to be operated on due to an aggravation of their obstruction. To sum up, the main advantage of prenatal diagnosis is that it presents the patient without urinary infection. Double-diuretic scintigraphy has proved to be the best option to explore the obstruction when dilated despite its limitations in the case of deficient renal function. The most frequent diagnosis, which has undergone a major increase in the last few years, is PUJ obstruction in the manner of pyelic dilatation. Many of them are not confirmed postnatally and most of them (more than 70%) do not need surgical treatment."

This has been achieved as a result of the safe profile and the increased stability of microbubbles persisting in the bloodstream for several minutes, and also by the availability of specialized contrast-specific US techniques, which allow a definite improvement in the contrast resolution and suppression of signal from stationary tissues. CEUS with low transmit power allows real-time scanning with the possibility of prolonged organ insonation. Several reports have described the effectiveness of microbubble contrast agents in many clinical applications and particularly in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. CEUS allows the assessment of the macrovasculature and microvasculature in different parenchymas, the identification and characterization of hepatic and splenic lesions, the depiction of septal enhancement in cystic renal masses, and the quantification of organ perfusion by the quantitative analysis of the echo-signal intensity. Other fields of application include the assessment of abdominal organs after traumas and the assessment of vesico-ureteral reflux in children.

Radiologic investigation is an important source of clinical information in lower urinary tract disorders but should not inconvenience the patient, expose the patient to unnecessary radiation, or delay surgical correction. In pediatric patients with suspected underlying urologic structural anomalies, screening ultrasonography is commonly the initial diagnostic study. If dilatation of the urinary tract is confirmed, voiding cystourethrography is performed to determine the presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and other causes of upper tract dilatation. If VUR is confirmed, follow-up with nuclear cystography or echo-enhanced cystosonography may be performed. If VUR is excluded, nuclear diuresis renography is the primary test for differentiating between obstructed and nonobstructed megaureter. Intravenous urography can be used to specifically identify an area of obstruction and to determine the presence of duplex collecting systems and a ureterocele. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are unsuitable for general screening but provide superb anatomic detail and added diagnostic specificity. MR imaging is mandatory in the evaluation of associated spinal anomalies. MR urography can demonstrate ectopic extravesical ureteric insertions, thereby providing a global view of the malformation. Familiarity with anomalies of the lower urinary tract is essential for correct diagnosis and appropriate management."
CD010657,0,19112220,0,Evaluating kidney damage from vesico-ureteral reflux in children.,"To review the most relevant clinical studies that evaluate kidney damage in children with primary vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR), we reviewed and compared randomized controlled trials and clinical trials from scientific literature. In these studies, vesico-ureteral reflux was diagnosed by voiding cystourethrogram and kidney damage was assessed by either DMSA scan or urography. Relative risk with 95% confidence intervals was calculated using Review Manager Software (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2000). The overall relative risk of kidney damage shown by DMSA scan and urography was statistically higher in children with vesico-ureteral reflux of various degrees than in controls (3.7 times and 2.8 times, respectively). However, in high-grade VUR, the relative risk of congenital kidney damage was 5.6 times that of controls. We conclude that severe VUR is frequently associated with early kidney damage, perhaps with prenatal onset. Progression of kidney damage may depend on the severity of VUR and untreated urinary tract infections. Prevention of congenital kidney damage from severe VUR is possible when there is early intervention, even during fetal growth."

The study was performed on children aged two to 12 years; female children with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) and clinical suspicion of VUR and males with history of UTI and VUR who attended follow-up during the six months study period were selected. Non-cooperative patients were excluded from the study. A total of 90 patients were studied. The data gathering method was sequential. The following sonographic parameters were assessed in all the study patients: antero-posterior pelvic diameter, distal ureteric diameter and stasis of urinary system, which were measured at rest and during and after the Valsalva maneuver. Also, the vesicoureteral junction distance and distance of vesicoureteral junction to the midline were measured on both sides at rest.

The aims of the study were to determine the actual rate of VUR in neonates with UTI and to define the clinical clues to its diagnosis. The study sample included term infants with a diagnosis of UTI during their first month of life who were seen in this hospital between January 1997 and May 1999. All infants underwent complete diagnostic work-up (renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography [VCUG]). The medical files were reviewed for patient sex, age at UTI diagnosis, laboratory findings (including causative pathogen), and ultrasonographic findings. These parameters were correlated with the finding of VUR on VCUG. Sixty-four neonates (55 males, 9 females) with UTI were included in this study. UTI was 6 times more common in males than females, although the incidence of VUR was equal between the sexes (about 20%). The presence of VUR was associated with a significantly younger age at presentation of UTI (11.4+/-4 vs 16.9+/-6.6 days, p<0.01). VUR was diagnosed at a fourfold higher rate in neonates with Klebsiella-induced UTI compared to those with E. Coli-UTI. In 80% of those with significantly abnormal ultrasonographic findings VUR was found on VCUG. Jaundice was noted at UTI diagnosis 3 times more often in infants with VUR, and elevated creatinine level, 2.5 times more often."

Follow-up at the age of 4 depicted bilateral reflux deterioration; an urodynamics study that followed revealed functional bladder instability in both girls and the oral antispasmodic oxybutynin was initiated with good results. Evaluation for reflux should be prompt in infants with urinary infection. Patient siblings display a higher relative reflux risk, being highest in identical twins. Heredity issues, the impact of age and dysfunctional voiding in the clinical course, and the contribution of nuclear medicine in VUR management are discussed."

Of 16 renal tracts with VUR radiologically classified as gross all had reflux demonstrated on RMC and in 15 of these the reflux reached the renal pelvis. Eight of the 12 renal tracts with moderate VUR and three of four with slight VUR were shown to reflux on RMC. RMC should prove valuable for following the course of patients with VUR treated surgically or conservatively because of the lower gonadal radiation dose resulting from this technique compared with the conventional radiological method.

Day wetting constitutes a heterogeneous group of syndromes, which should be considered as functional urinary incontinences and which require differentiated diagnostics and therapies. General aspects of functional urinary incontinence are discussed, including: classification, epidemiology, symptomatology, especially the association with urinary tract infections, vesicoureteral reflux, obstipation and encopresis. The rate of psychiatric problems seems to be increased compared to children with nocturnal enuresis. Methodological problems of previous studies are discussed. General guidelines regarding diagnostics and therapy include the requirement of sonography, uroflowmetry with pelvic-floor-EMG, urinalysis and specific therapy-forms. The three most important syndromes are urge incontinence with urge symptoms, frequent micturition, holding manoeuvres due to a physiological instability of the detrusor and lower, mostly secondary psychiatric symptoms. Voiding postponement is a general refusal syndrome with a psychiatric etiology, characterized by a postponement of micturition and retention of urine. The detrusor-sphincter-dyscoordination has as the main symptom a paradox contraction instead of relaxation of the bladder sphincter during micturition. It is recommended hat the previous classification should be left in favour of more specific diagnoses to ensure specific, causally effective therapies."

CD010657,0,20069314,0,Catheter-free methods for vesicoureteric reflux detection: our experience and a critical appraisal of existing data.,"In recent years, the exact role of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in general has become controversial, though in some groups of children the knowledge of the existence or non-existence of VUR is still a very important issue. The number of techniques available for the assessment of VUR is increasing, and a new classification taking into account their real characteristics (direct/indirect, catheter-using/catheter-free, radiation-giving/radiation-free) has been proposed. The purpose of the following review is to evaluate the currently available evidence supporting the use of various catheter-free methods for VUR detection. We believe that as the clinical role of VUR has been questioned, it is even more important for the method of its detection to be user-friendly as regards catheterisation, radiation and availability. There is still no evidence supporting the assertion that any of the catheter-free methods of VUR detection might be the optimal one for any child. However, there are some groups of children who would benefit from using them. New studies using new, catheter-free methods of VUR detection or a combination of two or more of the methods described may prove useful in improving sensitivity and providing additional data on this important issue."
CD010657,0,2186541,0,Early ureteral surgery for posterior urethral valves.,"The obstruction caused by posterior urethral valves may be responsible for profound dysfunction of the entire proximal urinary tract. The pathophysiologic relations between the valves and function of the ureterovesical junction and upper urinary tract are key in determining the need for upper tract surgery. In most cases, function of the ureters and ureterovesical junction is directly related to high intravesical pressure and will normalize when pressures drop after valve destruction. However, upper tract function remains abnormal in some cases and leads to complications that necessitate early ureteral and upper tract surgical intervention. The second crucial relation in the management of patients with posterior urethral valves is that between renal dysfunction and urinary tract obstruction. The surgeon is compelled to maximize the potential for renal function. The relation between renal dysplasia, obstructive uropathy, and urinary tract obstruction complicates the management of patients with posterior urethral valves and challenges us to develop new methods to measure potential renal function. Patients born with posterior urethral valves are treated initially with bladder drainage, which is undertaken by placement of a urethral catheter at the time diagnosis is made with the voiding cystogram. During this initial period of evaluation and stabilization, the patient's medical status is optimized, giving the surgeon information concerning renal function and prognosis to allow the most efficient surgical management. In almost all cases, posterior urethral valves are destroyed primarily, most often by transurethral fulguration. This usually leads to rapid improvement of bladder, upper tract, and renal function. When primary fulguration is not advisable, drainage through a vesicostomy is a useful alternative. Utilizing either method, low-pressure bladder drainage is a primary goal in the initial management of patients in most centers. As with many problems in surgery, our ability to accurately identify patients who would benefit from surgery is more limited than our surgical effectiveness. Voiding cystograms allow us to diagnose reflux and to follow bladder emptying and function. Serial ultrasound scans, nuclear medicine scans, and pressure-perfusion studies give us insight into upper urinary tract function. Too often, however, limitations of the patient's condition and size and the severe degree of urinary tract abnormalities make the results difficult to interpret. Although diagnostic tests are invaluable in making decisions about upper tract surgery in patients with posterior urethral valves, these decisions are most often based on the classic clinical urologic problems of urinary extravasation, obstruction, infection, reflux, and azotemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This paper reviews this protocol to determine: (1) the prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in isolated ANH and (2) the value of performing VCUG in cases of mild hydronephrosis, defined as renal pelvis dilatation <10 mm on postnatal ultrasonography (US). A retrospective chart review was performed on infants referred with ANH. The inclusion criterion was isolated ANH. Exclusion criteria were (1) presence of additional genitourinary abnormalities and (2) no VCUG. Pelviectasis was categorized according to the anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis. There were 111 infants with isolated ANH. All except 3 underwent VCUG. There were 68 children (63%) with normal postnatal US or mild pelviectasis (<10 mm). VUR was detected in 16 patients, of whom 10 had mild or absent pelvic dilatation. There was no correlation between the degree of pelviectasis on postnatal US and the presence or severity of VUR ( P=0.567 and P=0.802). VUR was detected in 15% of children with isolated ANH, many of whom had normal postnatal US or mild postnatal pelviectasis. VCUG is the only reliable test for detecting postnatal VUR."

Data of patients who were examined by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy between 1995 and 2005 were evaluated retrospectively. Gender, age, reflux grade, presence/development of scarring, breakthrough UTIs, and resolution of reflux, were recorded. The relation of gender, age and VUR grade to preformed scarring and the relation of gender, age, VUR grade, presence of preformed scarring, number of breakthrough UTIs and reflux resolution to new scarring were assessed. There were 138 patients [male/female (M/F) 53/85]. Multivariate analysis showed that male gender [odds ratio (OR) 2.5], age > or = 27 months in girls (OR 4.2) and grades IV-V reflux (OR 12.4) were independent indicators of renal scarring. On the other hand, only the presence of previous renal scarring was found to be an independent indicator for the development of new renal scar (OR 13.4). In conclusion, while the most predictive variables for the presence of renal scarring among children presenting with a UTI were male gender, age > or = 27 months in girls, and grades IV-V reflux, the best predictor of new scar formation was presence of previous renal scarring."
CD010657,0,16377104,0,Obstructive uropathy.,"Routine second trimester ultrasound screening has resulted in more infants diagnosed with antenatal hydronephrosis. Current recommendations suggest postnatal evaluation of all infants with a renal pelvic diameter >5 mm with ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG.) There are many etiologies of obstructive uropathy including ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction, posterior urethral valves (PUV), prune belly syndrome, and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Obstructive uropathy can result in tubular damage and decreased nephron number. Tubular damage can result in sodium wasting, hyperkalemic acidosis, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Most patients do not require renal replacement therapy in the neonatal period; however, chronic renal insufficiency can occur if the neonate has a significant reduction in nephron number or progressive renal damage from obstruction or infection."
CD010657,0,22569440,1,Predisposing factors for renal scarring in children with urinary tract infection.,"This study was undertaken to determine the predisposing factors for renal scarring in children with urinary tract infection. In this prospective cohort study, 176 children with documented urinary tract infection were categorized into four groups: ≤1 year old, 1-2 years old, 2-7 years and 7-14 years old. Ultrasonography and Technetium-99 m-DMSA scan were used to detect the possible abnormalities. Infants under 12 months old presented as the most common group for renal scarring (27 cases, 52.9%), and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed in 29 cases (56.8%). Fifteen (41.67%) children between the ages of one and two years had renal scar, and VUR was detected in half of the patients. In the third group, 36.3%, and in fourth group, 41.6% of the patients had renal scar. Also, 38.6% in group three and 50% in the final group had VUR. A co-incidental finding that was observed in this study was the high incidence of pseudohypoaldesteronism (PHA) in our patients: in 39.2% of the children in group one, 22.2% in group two and 4% in group three. In group four however, none of the patients had PHA. Risk of scar formation with urinary tract infection (UTI) was higher in the younger age group and in those with recurrent UTIs."

Comparison with dimercaptosuccinic acid planar scintigraphy and intravenous pyelography.,"The value of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) planar renal scintigraphy, DMSA single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of renal injury related to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was examined in 60 kidneys of 32 pediatric patients (28 bilateral, 4 unilateral) with primary VUR. The results were: (1) detection of minor renal lesions was best with MRI, then DMSA-planar and DMSA-SPECT, and (2) in comparing the positive rate, DMSA-SPECT (85%) and MRI (83.3%) were superior to intravenous pyelography (55%) and DMSA-planar scintigraphy (65%). These results suggest that DMSA-SPECT or MRI may be more sensitive than DMSA-planar scintigraphy and intravenous pyelography in detecting renal injury related to VUR in pediatric patients."
CD010657,0,3015828,0,The detection of vesicoureteral reflux in the child.,"Reflux is often an important phenomenon in the urinary tract of a child, and many methods have been advocated to detect it. The single most sensitive, accurate, and efficient way currently available to detect and characterize reflux is direct VCUG under fluoroscopic control with the contrast material instilled through a urethral catheter. Nuclear cystography is the most efficient method for screening for reflux in appropriate situations, for making sure the reflux has disappeared after corrective surgery, and for following reflux that is likely to subside spontaneously."

CD010657,0,8176559,0,Congenital renal damage associated with primary vesicoureteral reflux detected prenatally in male infants.,"To assess the course of vesicoureteral reflux, we performed cystography, renal scintigraphy, and urography in all neonates with the prenatal diagnosis of renal pelvic dilation and revealed the presence of primary reflux (grades I to V) in 27 cases. Higher grades of reflux were associated with congenital renal damage, as shown by reduced tracer uptake during scintigraphy. Reflux was diagnosed more frequently in male infants (male/female ratio, 6:1), in many of whom bladder abnormalities were found by cystography. In another group of seven infants, in whom the reflux was associated with other urologic abnormalities, there was no sex prevalence. We conclude that severe primary reflux associated with hydronephrosis usually affects male infants and may be due to abnormal embryologic development of the male urethra, and that the kidney damage is primary and not the result of urinary tract infections. This pattern differs from that of vesicoureteric reflux diagnosed at an older age, which is observed most commonly in female patients."

CD010657,0,22152906,0,Metanephric stromal tumor: a challenging diagnostic entity in children.,"A case with a renal mass diagnosed as metanephric stromal tumor is presented. A 6-year-old boy presented with frequently recurring urinary tract infections. He had been followed up at different medical centers for the last 2 years with a 2 × 2 cm simple cyst localized in the inferior pole of the left kidney. At our center, ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous mass in the left kidney with a central cystic component. The patient underwent operation for left renal mass, and heminephrectomy was performed. The 5 × 4 × 2.5 cm left heminephrectomy specimen showed a partially cystic mass composed of bland spindle cells distributed haphazardly, entrapping tubules and glomeruli and producing fine collarettes around some tubules. The cysts were lined with a 1-layered flat or cuboidal epithelium. Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as metanephric stromal tumor. Metanephric stromal tumor is a rare renal neoplasm of childhood that can present as a cystic mass, and the solid component can go radiologically undetected because of the blurring infiltrative margins. By presenting this rare entity, the authors suggest that this should be included in the differential diagnosis, thereby helping to avoid complications and unnecessary treatment."

The radiation exposure of the patient is 50-200 times less than the established reference method (X-ray refluxcystography). However, the amount of reflux, i.e. the stage of disease can only be determined by the radiologic method. On the basis of our results it is therefore recommended to use the radionuclide reflux-cystography method as basic investigation and for follow-up. If the basic investigation shows a reflux classification of the reflux has to be evaluated by X-ray reflux-cystography."

In our series 36 boys with epididymitis underwent noninvasive urodynamic studies to determine whether a physiological defect could be assigned as an etiology. The 2 mechanisms proposed are similar to that in children with vesicoureteral reflux associated with dyssynergia or bladder instability and to a cause of recurrent urinary tract infection in children (the infrequent voider syndrome). Urinalysis and urine culture are recommended in all children with epididymitis and urethral swabs are obtained from those who are sexually active. We recommend renal/bladder ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography in all infants and young children with epididymitis. In the older child we advocate detailed questioning regarding voiding symptoms and the performance of noninvasive urodynamic studies."

CD010657,0,9312745,0,[Total agenesis of the sacrum and neurogenic bladder dysfunction].,"Total Sacral Agenesis (TSA) is a rare congenital anomaly of the lower vertebral column, frequently associated with bladder dysfunction. The diagnosis is often delayed until the evidence of neurological disorders addresses at neuro-radiological examination. In the last 9 years we observed 7 children, 3 males and 4 females, with TSA. The average age at diagnosis was 8 years (range: 1-15 years). Maternal diabetes was present only in one case. In 5 patients, urological ones have been the symptoms of presentation. In one case, TSA has been discovered because of the presence of a sacral mass (lipoma) and the subsequent development of club-foot. The neurological screening, performed in all patients with anorectal anomalies, led to the diagnosis of total sacral agenesis in a child with anteriorized anus. All patients have been evaluated by means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, renal ultrasound, voiding cystography, renal nuclear scan and urodynamics. The functional evaluation of the lower urinary tract has shown a pattern of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in all children, while bilateral vesico-ureteral reflux has been detected in 2 cases. Intermittent clean catheterization (ICC) has been instituted at the diagnosis in all children. Surgery for continence and protection of upper urinary tract (bladder augmentation and bilateral ureteral reimplantation) has been performed in one patient. At a medium follow-up of 3 years (range: 1-5 years) 2 patients have been lost, normal renal function and urinary continence have been achieved in 4 and one child is continent but has renal failure. An early diagnosis and a correct neuro-urological evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent urinary tract damage and achieve urinary continence in these patients. Symptoms, clinical findings and relationship with maternal diabetes are discussed.

According to the results of these examinations, the patients were divided into three groups. In Group 1 (71 patients), abnormal sonographic findings were confirmed by the radiographic studies. Patients in Group 2 (51 patients) had discrepancies between sonographic and radiographic findings, the most important of which concerned the assessment of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). In Group 3 (118 patients), sonographic and subsequent radiographic investigations were normal. Although ultrasonography can sometimes detect VUR, major reflux can be missed by sonography alone. In young children at risk for reflux nephropathy, ultrasound examination of the urinary tract must be accompanied by a VCU or isotope cysto-urethrogram."

We analyzed kidney growth and renal function in 33 children with prenatally diagnosed unilateral MCDK in a long-term study. The mean observation period was 4.9 years with a range of 1-11.6 years. Abnormalities of the contralateral kidney were found in 10 of 33 patients (30%): ureteropelvic junction obstruction (5), ureterovesical junction obstruction (2), and vesicoureteral reflux (3). In 6 children the dysplastic kidney had been removed. Complete involution was observed in 48% and a decrease of size in 33% of 27 dysplastic kidneys. At the time of last examination, 27 of 29 children showed a volume of the contralateral kidney above the normal range (>145%). Hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney, defined as kidney length above 2 standard deviation scores (SDS), was seen in 24% of 33 children at birth, thus showing that hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney starts in utero and continues throughout childhood. The extent of contralateral hypertrophy was independent of associated abnormalities in this study. Mean creatinine was increased in the whole group (mean +1.13 SDS). Calculated creatinine clearance in 21 patients over 2 years was within normal limits, with a median of 102 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (range 84-143). Based on the results of this and previous studies, nephrectomy cannot be recommended in typical cases, but a regular follow-up of these patients seems necessary."

This study reports the clinical features of 19 pediatric patients with UTIs in whom associated hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules were incidentally diagnosed by the imaging tests performed for the UTI. Hepatic nodules in five patients were detected on ultrasound scans, and pulmonary nodules and both hepatic and pulmonary nodules were detected in 12 and two children by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. The mean age of the patients was 24.5 months. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected in nine of 17 patients (52.9%), acute pyelonephritis was identified in nine of 18 patients, and renal scarring was found in 57.1% patients with pyelonephritis. On follow-up, the hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules regressed in all patients. About 85.7% of patients experienced a recurrence of UTI within 1 year. In comparison with age- and sex-matched controls with UTIs without pulmonary or hepatic nodules, the presence of VUR and the recurrence of UTI within 1 year were higher in patients with UTIs and nodules (P<0.05). The hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules identified on the ultrasound scan and by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy may provide a valuable diagnostic marker for the proper management of patients with an UTI."

CD010657,0,14618532,0,A giant fetal urinoma in a neonate without detectable obstructive uropathy.,"Fetal urinoma is an uncommon finding in prenatal investigations. Most previous reports have, almost in every case, referred to the presence of an obstructive uropathy and thus to very high pressure in the upper urinary tract during fetal life. In this paper we present a prenatally detected fetal giant urinoma occurring in the absence of an apparent obstructive uropathy but associated with an ipsilateral vesico-ureteral reflux."
CD010657,0,10451891,0,[Vesico-ureteral reflux: diagnostic and therapeutic procedures].,"The vesico ureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common uropathy associated to urinary tract infections (UTI). The identification of V.U.R. is very important to avoid reflux nephropathy and it's complications. To avoid the exposure to unnecessary and injurious x-rays, the authors propose patient selection based on the presence or absence of distal ureteral dilatation and on the time elapsed between typical or atypical symptoms of u.t.i. and fever. First of all, it is essential to diagnose pielonephritis. After ultrasound and radionuclide scintigram with DMSA they select the infants who need cystourethrography. The infants with V.U.R. undergo antibiotic prophylaxis until spontaneous or surgical recovery. The duration of prophylaxis depends on the degree of V.U.R. and the age of the infant at diagnosis."
CD010657,0,1904256,0,[Obstructive urethral disease in neonates].,"In the past eight years, we observed 23 cases of neonatal urethral obstruction: 15 posterior urethral valves, one urethral polyp, two urethral diverticula, one penile urethra hypoplasia, two syringoceles, one scafoid urethra, one urethral agenesis in Prune Belly syndrome. In most cases a prenatal diagnosis of uropathy had been made by ultrasonography that allowed a faster diagnosis and possibly a long-term better prognosis in those patients in which early treatment reduced postnatal damage. In all patients endoscopic resection was performed under direct view. In 14 of them endoscopic treatment solved the problem, while further surgery on the upper urinary tract was needed in the others. We had no stenotic nor other-short and medium-term complications. The incidence of renal dysplasia is high with posterior urethral valves, while upper urinary tract damages are sensibly less frequent with more distal obstructions."

CD010657,0,3829531,0,Grading of reflux by radionuclide cystography.,"Over a three-year period, radionuclide cystography (RC) was performed on 145 patients. Of these, 31 nephroureteral units in 25 patients demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux by RC and also by radiographic cystography (XC). The RC and XC studies were performed within three months of one another. The grading of reflux was determined by RC and then compared with that of XC using the criteria for grading as established by the International Reflux Study Committee (IRSC). Of 18 nephroureteral units in 14 patients with grade II reflux by XC, 14 were similarly graded by RC (78%). Of five nephroureteral units in five patients with grade III reflux by XC, the correlation by RC was 100%. However, when grades II and III were combined into a single category of low-grade reflux, the correlation achieved between the two cystographic techniques was 100%. Of five nephroureteral units in four patients with grade IV reflux by XC, the correlation was 60%, and in three units in two patients with grade V reflux the correlation was 100%. When grades IV and V are combined into a category of high-grade reflux, a correlation of 100% is achieved. When the reflux is graded into the five IRSC categories, the overall unequivocal correlation between the two studies is 80%. However, when only two categories are used (low grade = grades II and III, and high grade = grades IV and V), a correlation of 100% is obtained."

Correlation with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), performed ont he same day, was obtained in all patients. Thirty-six patients with normal VCUG results and normal renal and bladder ultrasound (US) studies served as the control group for 39 patients with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and 26 patients with urinary tract disorders other than reflux. The site of the ureteric orifice and duration, direction, and turbulence of the jets were recorded. Duration varied from 0.4 sec to 7.5 sec and depended largely on fluid intake. Duration varied in an individual patient by up to 2 sec from one jet to another. The direction of the normal jet was anteromedial and upward. Jets from refluxing ureters can appear normal. Severe renal parenchymal scarring reduced frequency and amplitude of the jets. Doppler analysis of the ureteric jet does not allow diagnosis or exclusion of VUR. Color Doppler was more sensitive in demonstrating ureteric jets than was gray-scale, real-time US and facilitated the study, but it was equally unable to help predict reflux."

CD010657,0,1870925,0,Renal obstructive dysplasia: ultrasound diagnosis and therapeutic implications.,"57 cases of renal obstructive dysplasia (defined as the abnormal development of nephronic and ductal structures due to in utero obstruction of the urinary tract) were evaluated in terms of sonographic findings, renal and other associated anomalies, and current status of the child. More than one-third of the cases had bilateral disease and although not uniformly fatal bilateral involvement was associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In 12 of the 33 cases with unilateral dysplasia there was an association with contralateral renal problems including uretero-pelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux and aplasia. Almost one-half of the cases had congenital anomalies, these included VACTERL association, congenital heart disease, cranial abnormalities and gastrointestinal malformations. Fifteen stillborns and 12 of the patients with bilateral involvement and four with unilateral involvement have died. Four patients are on dialysis (two with bilateral involvement and two with unilateral renal obstructive dysplasia). Only one-quarter are otherwise normal. More serious problems are reported in this mixed age population of patients with obstructive renal dysplasia than has been identified in previous studies. Management decisions of the fetus and child must be based on this new age-expanded population."

Two were initially thought to have the salt-losing form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Although prompt diagnosis of this potentially fatal condition is critical, its mimicry by urosepsis in infants with VUR is actually more common.

Although it is known that vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) predisposes to UTIs and it seems to have an important role in the development of renal lesions, some recent published studies question that relation. The aim of the study was to evaluate renal scarring by using renal scintigraphy 99mTc-DMSA and see the relation with or without the presence of VUR."
CD010657,0,1433589,0,Followup of conservatively treated children with high and low grade vesicoureteral reflux: a prospective study.,"A total of 202 children (mean age 31.5 +/- 23.3 months) with vesicoureteral reflux identified during the investigation that follows a urinary tract infection entered this prospective study dealing with the medical management of reflux. The diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux was made significantly earlier in boys than in girls regardless of reflux grade (p < 0.001). At entry reflux nephropathy was present on a dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in 44% of 314 refluxing kidneys. There was no significant difference between boys and girls in the prevalence of reflux nephropathy. The renal lesions were more severe in boys independently of the grade of vesicoureteral reflux (p < 0.05). Breakthrough urinary tract infection was significantly more common in girls than in boys, regardless of vesicoureteral reflux grade (p < 0.05). Mean followup was 68.7 +/- 31.2 months. Patient age at the time of the first of 2 radionuclide cystograms without vesicoureteral reflux was considered the age of spontaneous resolution of reflux. Using life table estimations and analyzing data stratified to sex and grade of vesicoureteral reflux, we found that although reflux lasted longer in boys compared to girls, this difference was not statistically significant. During followup new scars developed in 7 patients related to breakthrough urinary tract infection. There was no significant difference between boys and girls in the development of new scars. To understand the natural history of vesicoureteral reflux children must be stratified by sex and grade of reflux."

CD010657,0,19593590,1,The efficacy of ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in predicting vesicoureteral reflux in children below the age of 2 years with their first febrile urinary tract infection.,"We evaluated the efficacy of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and ultrasound (US) in comparison with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in predicting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children below the age of 2 years. Medical records and radiologic studies of children (<2 years) suffering their first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) between January 2001 and May 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of US and DMSA scans in diagnosing VUR. Among 220 children with their first febrile UTI, VUR was detected in 67 (30.4%). The detection rate of VUR by US was 41.7% and 86% in the low (I, II) and high grade (III~IV) groups, respectively. Detection rate of VUR by DMSA scan was 37.5% and 88.4% in the low and high grade groups, respectively. Combining US and DMSA scan, we found that the detection rate of high grade VUR was 95.3% and that of low grade was 62.5%. During follow up, most of the low grade VURs with normal DMSA and US scans resolved or were downgraded. Most high grade VURs could be detected by US and DMSA scan, but the prediction rate was not as high in low grade VURs. However, we can anticipate spontaneous improvement without complications in patients with either low or high grade reflux and negative findings on US and DMSA scan."

Sonographically a VUR was assumed if a retrovesical dilated ureter and/or an increase of the separation of the central renal echo complex (CRC) could be detected. By means of sonography VUR grades III and IV were seen in 100%, grade II in 84% of all cases. There was a false positive rate of 10%. Sonographic reflux study is a sensitive and specific screening and follow-up procedure for VUR."

Bilateral renal stones and pyelonephritis were diagnosed after roentgenography, ultrasonography and urinalysis. Pyelonephritis was successfully treated with antibiotics and the left renal stone was completely disintegrated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Spectrophotometric analysis revealed that the stone was composed of pure ammonium urate (AU). The patient had not experienced any episodes of urinary tract infection from the antireflux surgery until the present event, but had lost 20 kg in body weight during the last year due to a low-caloric diet and laxative abuse. AU urinary stones have been infrequently reported in Japan, and they are supposed to be associated with a low-caloric diet, laxative abuse, and anorexia nervosa."
CD010657,0,22117375,0,[Four infants with upper urinary tract infection due to extended-spectrum bata lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli].,"Bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) are detected mainly in adult urinary specimens, and are believed to cause hospital-acquired infection due to their resistance to many drugs. The incidence of community-acquired infection due to such bacteria is increasing, but few cases of infant upper urinary tract infection (UUTI) have been reported in Japan. We treated four infants with UUTI caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, as determined by genotyping. Using medical records, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical course, antibiotic use and efficacy, antimicrobial susceptibility results, and the presence of underlying disease. One of the four had been previously hospitalized for occult bacteremia. Two developed UUTI after antibiotic treatment, indicating that previous antibiotic use may have been a risk factor in these cases. We could not identify the infection route in all cases. Two of the four had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Renal scintigraphy was done in three. Although an initial dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) defect was detected in all four, only one had renal scarring. E. coli isolates from all four showed PCR signals for blaCTX-M-; one isolate positive for the blaCTX-M3 group and three positive for blaCTX-M14. Antimicrobial susceptibility test results showed all isolates to be resistant to cephalosporins, but discrepancies existed between antimicrobial susceptibility results and actual clinical efficacy. Clinically, cefazolin (CEZ) was effective in two subjects and ceftazidime (CAZ) effective in one. Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) was effective in one. None of the four developed sepsis or meningitis. Post hospitalization antibiotic prophylaxis showed that none of the four has had UUTI recur. Japan's ESBL-producing bacterial infection incidence is increasing, so medical professionals should watch for such UUTI even in first-case occurrence in infants."

In order to study foetal VUR and its consequences, newborns with foetal hydronephrosis were investigated by ultrasound, micturating cystourethrogram and 99mTechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA), after beginning of chemoprophylaxis. Twenty-eight infants with VUR (bilateral in 15 cases) were identified giving a total 43 renal units for study. There was a predominance of males (86%), moderate/severe reflux (84%) and renal damage (51%). Presence of renal damage was correlated with the severity of reflux. VUR should be investigated in cases of foetal hydronephrosis and our results support that renal damage is frequently congenital and not secondary to urinary tract infection."

CD010657,0,22271698,0,Urinary proteome analysis to exclude severe vesicoureteral reflux.,"High-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, grade IV or V) is a risk factor for renal scarring, impaired renal function, and arterial hypertension. Voiding cystourethrography is the gold standard for detecting the severity of VUR. High-grade VUR is present in the minority of children with urinary tract infection (UTI), thus exposing the majority to invasive diagnostics that have no surgical consequence. We therefore aimed at establishing a noninvasive test to identify children with high-grade VUR."
CD010657,0,20151788,0,Dizygotic twin pregnancy with a normal fetus and a nodular embryo associated with a partial hydatidiform mole.,"Although twin pregnancies complicated by a coexisting complete hydatidiform mole are uncommon, those with partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) are exceedingly rare; there are only several well-documented cases diagnosed antenatally. Here we present the first case of a twin placenta containing a nodular embryo associated with PHM diagnosed on routine placental examination. This dizygotic twin pregnancy featured viable embryos at 8 weeks' gestation, death of 1 embryo at 12 weeks, and delivery of a healthy infant by caesarean section at 28 weeks because of worsening maternal reflux nephropathy. Macroscopic and microscopic placental examination and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed one part of the placenta to be diploid and the other to contain a vanishing triploid embryo and a PHM, which had eluded antenatal ultrasound diagnosis. Careful pathologic examination of vanishing twins and their placentas may disclose an unexpected PHM, which can be associated, albeit infrequently, with persistent gestational trophoblastic disease or a trophoblastic tumor."
CD010657,0,20545465,0,Severe complications after endoscopic injection of polydimethylsiloxane for the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux in early childhood.,"Endoscopic subureteral injection of bulking agents has become a widespread treatment for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children. Various biological and plastic materials have been introduced for this purpose with different success and complication rates. Evaluations of this method in previous studies have focused on the success rate of eliminating VUR, whereas complications have been less frequently reported in detail. This report describes four children with VUR grade I to IV-V who experienced severe complications after endoscopic treatment with polydimethylsiloxane at the age of 5 months to 7 years. Three children developed urosepsis and two patients obstructive acute renal failure. These complications required repeated hospitalizations with extensive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Percutaneous nephrostomy was necessary in three patients and ureteroneocystostomy was eventually performed in all. These observations suggest that endoscopic treatment of VUR in childhood with polydimethylsiloxane can lead to severe postoperative complications and that a standardized follow-up should be an integral part of endoscopic procedures."
CD010657,0,2242311,0,Quantitation of vesico-ureteral reflux by radionuclide cystography and urodynamics.,A method is described for the quantitation of vesico-ureteral reflux by synchronous combined direct radionuclide cystography and urodynamics. Intravesical pressures and volumes are co-ordinated with volumes of reflux. Peak reflux volumes in 11 children diagnosed as having severe (grades 3-4) reflux on conventional contrast cystography ranged from 1 to 50 ml/kidney. A number of different patterns of reflux were observed. Reflux may occur progressively throughout low pressure filling or incrementally with unstable bladder contractions. Reflux during voiding may be maximal as detrusor pressure falls. The method requires wider application to explore the potential for a functional classification of the reflux problem.

CD010657,0,14674222,0,Renal abscess in children: a clinical retrospective study.,"A renal abscess is rare in children and diagnosis is not readily apparent before hospitalization, because symptoms are often insidious and nonspecific. To evaluate the diagnostics and therapy of renal abscess in the pediatric group, we will report eight cases of renal abscess in children to illustrate the variable features of this condition. Eight patients, 6 to 156 (mean, 45.9) months old, with renal abscesses in 9 kidneys were identified. Ultrasound and computed tomography proved to be the most valuable diagnostic tool, revealing a hypoechoic or hypodense mass. Fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis were common presenting features, but no child presented symptoms of loin pain. Escherichia coli was identified in the urine culture among the 6 cases and blood culture in one case. Three children were associated with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. All patients had an intensive antibiotic treatment, which led to resolution of the abscess in eight of the nine kidneys. In one case, the abscess had to be drained using the CT-guided percutaneous drainage. During follow-up, seven children received 99mTc DMSA renal SPECT and only two of them had complete remission without sequelae of renal scar. We concluded that the renal abscesses must be assumed, especially, in children with prolonged fever, abdominal pain, and a high value of CRP. Ultrasonography is just a screening test to detect renal swelling, bulging, and enlargement; however, a CT scan is more sensitive and can detect abscess formation, as well as define the extent of the disease for planning conservative antibiotic treatment or additional drainage. Finally, DMSA renal SPECT is the best and the most sensitive examination for detecting the extension area of renal inflammation and correlated with the renal outcome."

CD010657,0,3184292,0,Optimal use of 99mtechnetium-glucoheptonate scintigraphy in the detection of pyelonephritic scarring in children: a preliminary report.,"Renal scintigraphy represents the optimal modality for the detection of renal scars. 99mTechnetium-glucoheptonate is rapidly accumulated by the kidney through glomerular filtration and active transport by renal tubular cells. This permits rapid visualization of the renal parenchyma in the early phase (1 to 3-minute images) and subsequent imaging of the collecting system and ureters. About 10 to 15 per cent of the injected activity remains in the kidney, labeling the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules (late phase or 1 to 2-hour images). The late phase has been used more commonly to assess renal parenchymal damage. Early and late phase glucoheptonate scanning was performed in 42 children as part of the evaluation of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections with or without a history of vesicoureteral reflux. Inter-observer reliability to interpret glucoheptonate scans was good (early, 83 per cent agreement and late, 93 per cent agreement). The ability of glucoheptonate scanning to detect renal scarring in children with febrile urinary tract infections was equivalent with the early or late phase of the study. In 6 patients renal scarring was detected on only the early phase scan and in 7 scarring was detected only in the late phase. Although the detection rates are equivalent the over-all detection of scarring is improved by using both phases. Therefore, the early phase of the glucoheptonate scan may be a valuable adjunct to conventional glucoheptonate scan methodology used for the detection of renal scarring in children with recurrent urinary tract infections."

Evaluation of the child with urinary tract infection and identification of those at risk for infection are of paramount importance. With early diagnosis and early institution of proper therapy, the likelihood of renal scarring can be significantly reduced, and thus outcome can be improved. This review points to the controversies surrounding the ability to accurately distinguish between upper and lower tract urinary infection, and whether this distinction is important in the care of the child with urinary infection. Vesicoureteric reflux as a risk factor is discussed. Ultrasound examination and voiding cystourethrogram or radionuclide cystogram are generally recommended for evaluating the lower urinary tract of infants and preschool children who have urinary tract infection. The role of dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning in evaluating the upper tract is debated."
CD010657,0,8021983,0,Primary dilated megaureter: long-term followup.,"Previously, we reported on the changing concepts in the management of 35 neonates with primary obstructive megaureters, 25 of whom were observed without surgery for a mean of 28 months while 10 were surgically treated. We report the long-term outcome of the 25 patients who were managed without surgery. This group consists of 19 male and 6 female neonates with 19 unilateral and 6 bilateral dilated ureters. Of the patients 17 presented with an antenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis, 2 with infection and 6 with incidental findings. None of the patients had vesicoureteral reflux. Followup serial imaging (2 or more studies per case) consisted of excretory urography in 18 of the 25 cases, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scan in 16 and/or sonogram in 10. Mean followup was 7.3 years (range 4.8 to 12.4) for 24 patients and 1 was lost to followup after 1.5 years. Excretory urography showed improvement in urinary tract dilatation in 12 cases and stable dilatation in 6. Renal scans demonstrated expected interval increases in the glomerular filtration rate with age without any deterioration in per cent of renal function in all 16 cases. None of the patients had stones, pain or pyelonephritis. We conclude that it is safe to follow a select group of patients with primary dilated megaureters in the absence of vesicoureteral reflux. We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis and serial urinary tract imaging to confirm renal growth and preservation of renal function."

CD010657,0,8021985,0,The selective use of dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,"Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scans were performed on 75 children (115 refluxing renal units) to determine the efficacy of routine scanning in patients with various grades of vesicoureteral reflux. Cystourethrography demonstrated grades I and II reflux in 75 renal units and grades III to V in 40. Of the patients 51 presented with febrile urinary tract infection and 24 were asymptomatic (patients presenting with nonfebrile urinary tract infections or those undergoing sibling screening). Renal ultrasounds were performed in 60 patients. All patients were initially managed with medical therapy and 19 (25%) ultimately underwent antireflux surgery. DMSA scans demonstrated scarring in 17 of 40 renal units (43%) of patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and 6 of 75 renal units (8%) of those with low grade reflux. Renal ultrasounds that were interpreted as normal always correlated to a normal DMSA scan in asymptomatic patients. In patients presenting with febrile urinary tract infections the correlation between ultrasound and DMSA scan was inconsistent. We advocate a tailored approach in the evaluation of patients with vesicoureteral reflux. Renal sonography may be sufficient in the assessment of renal scarring in asymptomatic patients with reflux and those with low grade reflux. Conversely, in patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux, a history of febrile urinary tract infections and abnormal renal ultrasound DMSA renal scans appear to be most useful."

At presentation (mean age 5 years) all had VUR (grade III-V in 68) and urinary tract infection (UTI); there was renal scarring in 85 (acquired before referral in 11 and during follow-up in 1), hypertension in 6 and impaired renal function in 5. They were managed and followed prospectively by one paediatrician; 63% of these children remained free from UTI; VUR persisted in 63 and had resolved in 69% of 193 children managed medically. At follow-up, 61% of adults had remained free from infection; 17 adults had hypertension and/or raised plasma creatinine, 16 with scarred kidneys. Their deterioration was predictable because of scar type, blood pressure or plasma creatinine levels in childhood. No new scars developed after puberty. Renal growth rates were unaffected by initial severity or persistence of VUR. On the later questionnaire, 9 further adults, mean age 38 years, had moderate hypertension. The adults with complications were those with extensive renal scarring and/or at least borderline hypertension in childhood. Those with VUR, but no scarring, and managed carefully in childhood, did not suffer serious consequences as adults. There is a need for early recognition and treatment of children with VUR and UTI to limit scar development."

To evaluate whether simple Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty without symphysiotomy is effective for relief of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) in HK, we studied the records of ten children, two of whom had bilateral UPJO. Only one child presented with calculi; 11 units were operated upon for UPJO, 1 needed a partial nephrectomy. The surgical outcome was evaluated with emphasis on the changes in renal drainage and function assessed by ultrasonography and diuretic renal scans. Associated vesicoureteral reflux was observed more often (25%) than with UPJO in normal kidneys. Obstruction was caused by a crossing lower-pole vessel in three cases, a high ureteral insertion in two and narrowing of the UPJ 7. Postoperative follow-up (mean 5.5 years) revealed improved renal function and good drainage in all cases. Hydronephrosis vanished in 7, whereas grade 2 hydronephrosis remained in two children with former refluxive megaureter and grade 3 in one. All children are doing well and have no symptoms due to the persistent isthmus (Rovsing syndrome). It is concluded that simple Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty via a flank incision is a highly effective and safe procedure for treating UPJO in HK."

The data and images of 205 paediatric patients who had renal ultrasound and VCUG performed were reviewed. Abnormalities of renal length and kidney morphology were compared with degree of reflux on VCUG for each renal unit. A total of 407 renal units were evaluated. When the sonographic diagnosis of reflux was based solely on morphological criteria and degree of dilatation, correlation with VCUG results was poor. However, the fraction of kidneys of anomalous size increased markedly with grade of reflux, from 10% of non-refluxing renal units to 50% of renal units subjected to grade 4 and 5 VUR. Taking abnormal kidney length into account as well, dilative VUR was diagnosed by ultrasound with a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 82%-100%) and a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 63%-72%), P<0.001."

There were 8 neonates with unilateral obstruction of the ureter, and 2 with urethral valves and reflux. Nephrectomy because of hydronephrosis was necessary in 2 instances. The prenatal diagnosis of a urinary tract obstruction is of great importance, because the neonate may be operated upon without delay. Thus the diseased kidney can be saved.

CD010657,0,14521548,0,Medical management of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract.,"Renal damage in children has been found to be more congenital in origin than was previously thought. Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) involve renal dysplasia, renal hypoplasia, urinary tract obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux. CAKUT are sometimes bilateral and different types often coexist. Depending on their types and severity, children with CAKUT often have varying degrees of a reduced number of nephrons at birth. CAKUTare now the leading cause of renal failure in children. Children with renal dysplasia or obstructive uropathy may have abnormal renal tubules, and tend to lose essential water and sodium in urine. This can lead to poor body growth unless they are supplemented with water and sodium. Children with severe ureteric reflux often develop urinary infection and renal scarring. Renal scarring can further increase the risk of renal failure in children who already have other CAKUTand fewer nephrons than normal. Hypertension and proteinuria may develop in children with renal dysplasia and further aggravate renal function unless they are treated. Recent advances in the understanding and management of CAKUT make it possible for children with CAKUT to grow normally, have fewer complications such as urinary infection, have longer renal survival, and survive even with end-stage renal diseases through renal replacement therapy."
CD010657,0,14521549,0,"Changing concepts in urological management of the congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract, CAKUT.","Recent advancement in ultrasonographic evaluation has prompted early detection and diagnosis of congenital anomalies in the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in the asymptomatic phase. Consequently, early surgical intervention has become possible in the asymptomatic phase for the purpose of controlling manifestations early, thereby avoiding renal functional deterioration. However, some lesions detected by ultrasonography have been shown to often resolve or disappear without intervention. Thus, it has become more important to identify and understand the natural history of CAKUT. For the precise evaluation of the results of surgical intervention, one must understand the maturational process of renal function during infancy. Without considering this process, we cannot differentiate the renal significance of the surgical management from the natural course of CAKUT. Recent advancement in the field of radioisotopic studies has also made a major contribution to the more precise assessment of renal function. Recent progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology and the natural history of CAKUT has helped rationalize its treatment and management. Improvement in the surgical techniques and tools, together with improvements in pediatric anesthesiology, have made an appreciably positive impact on the outcome. Herein, we present the emerging concepts in the urological management of CAKUT, specifically, multicystic dysplastic kidney, vesicoureteral reflux, congenital hydronephrosis, ectopic ureters and ureteroceles."

Seventy-one patients were studied prospectively with voiding cystourethrography, sonography, and excretory urography; each examination was reviewed independently and without knowledge of the results of the others. Compared with urography the sensitivity and specificity of sonography was 100% and 51%, respectively, provided sonograms were of good technical quality. In a few instances, however, focal renal parenchymal scars were clearly seen only on urography. The findings suggest that in the absence of vesicoureteral reflux children with urinary tract infection should be studied with sonography. No further study is needed if a good-quality sonogram is within normal limits. In the presence of vesicoureteral reflux, however, or a suspicious or abnormal sonogram, excretory urography appears to be still necessary, at least at the present level of knowledge and technical expertise."

The current diagnostic tools are diuretic renography and ultrasound, after vesicoureteral reflux has been excluded. The realization that obstructive renographic drainage curves were not reliable indicators of obstruction in this patient group eventually altered the therapeutic approach from early operative intervention to a more conservative management in patients with a good relative kidney function.

A total of 183 children with 366 kidney-ureter units (KUUs) underwent VUS and VCUG in the same session with the same catheterization. VUS was performed after intravesical administration of 1 ml of a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent (UCA; SonoVue, Bracco, Italy). VUR was detected in 140 out of 366 cases (38%); in 89 (24.3%) by both methods, in 37 (10.1%) by VUS only, and in 14 (3.8%) by VCUG only. Although there was considerable agreement in the diagnosis of VUR by VUS and VCUG (κ=0.68, standard error [κ]=0.04), the difference in the detection rate of reflux between VUS and VCUG was significant (p<0.00001). The grade of VUR detected with VUS showed moderate agreement with grading by VCUG.

CD010657,0,18368911,0,[Vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring].,"Reflux nephropathy is an acquired focal renal scarring due to the combination of vesicoureteral (VUR) and intrarenal reflux (IRR) associated with urinary tract infections (IUT) and/or permanently high intravesical pressure. Up to 30-60% of children with VUR and a history of symptomatic IUT have renal scarring at the time of their initial studies. The onset of renal scarring usually occurs early in life, usually before age five years and most frequently before three years of age. Girls are at greater risk for developing reflux nephropathy, because of increased incidence of IUT. Reflux nephropathy is different from a diffuse congenital renal scarring (hypo-dysplasia), which is usually discovered antenatally or during infancy in boys with severe VUR. Without serial follow-up (ultrasonography, intravenous pyelourography, 99mTc-DMSA scan) from birth, it is not always possible to differentiate congenital renal scarring from reflux nephropathy. In contrast to reflux nephropathy, congenital renal scarring cannot be prevented. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is the gold standard technique (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) for the diagnosis of reflux nephropathy, but ultrasound is a good modality to monitor kidney growth over time. Reflux nephropathy and hypodysplasia are the main causes of chronic renal failure and arterial hypertension in children and adolescents in our country. The long-term follow-up of children with reflux nephropathy is mandatory, since its complications may take 10 to 20 years to develop. Uncontrollable arterial hypertension and proteinuria are the predictors of poor prognosis. The selective use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers is the efficient antihypertensive therapy, which also modify intrarenal haemodynamics and can preserve renal function."

In total, 38 children (10 girls, 28 boys) were studied: 21 with RA and 17 with MCDK. In 14 children (37%) anomalies of the urinary tract were suspected prenatally in ultrasound studies. In the remaining 24 children the diagnosis of RA/MCDK was made postnatally: in 13 (34%) in the first 7 days of life, in 11 (29%) at the age of 8 days to 34 months, mean 10.6+/-8.05 months. Voiding cystourethrography was done in 36 (95%) children, the isotopic 99mTc-EC/DMSA scan of the kidney in 29 (67%), and urography in 8. Urological anomalies were present in 11 (29%) children: in 7 (33%) with RA and in 4 (24%) with MCDK.

Among them, 2 children demanded surgery on the contralateral urinary tract: pyeloplasty in 1, antireflux procedure in 1; while 9 children were treated conservatively.

CD010657,0,2186540,0,Emergency treatment and long-term follow-up of posterior urethral valves.,"Posterior urethral valves have a broad spectrum of clinical severity determined by the degree and reversibility of the long stepwise sequence of secondary pathology. Neonatal azotemia and severe bilateral reflux are particularly important negative prognostic factors. In the mild cases, valve ablation with or without delayed reconstruction is good therapy. In the very severe cases, our interpretation of all the clinical and experimental information now available suggests that the time interval and the level of decompression are extremely important. Achievement of consistent low caliceal pressure without stasis and infections should be achieved as soon as possible. We do not agree with the philosophy of ""valve ablation and wait and see"" for secondary reconstruction as applied to the severe cases. An analogous philosophy would be treating all respiratory infections as upper respiratory infections and applying aggressive appropriate therapy for pneumonia only if the patient does not respond clinically. However, all controversy aside, the management of neonatal infants with posterior urethral valves remains a difficult and challenging problem for us all. The real challenge will be to improve published management results to the point that the family faced with decisions regarding an in utero diagnosis of posterior urethral valves will have enough hope to continue the pregnancy."

Whether these factors are best controlled by medical treatment or by surgical correction has been the source of some controversy. Although medical treatment may have improved over the years, so have the results of reconstructive surgery. Because the syndrome is a spectrum disorder, there will certainly be many patients who require little or no surgical intervention. The majority, however, will benefit from carefully planned and well-executed reconstructive surgery. Even in these cases, there should be a period of medical treatment and surveillance with interval re-evaluation. In a few patients, early stabilization will not be possible, and a drainage procedure such as vesicostomy will be necessary in the first days of life. Regardless of how an individual patient might be treated, he will require long-term follow-up surveillance.

However, it is not known whether DMSA scintigraphy performed during acute UTI has any prognostic value for outcome assessment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of DMSA scintigraphy performed during UTI as a predictor of patient outcome, to identify children at risk of events [vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) or recurrent UTI] that may lead to the development of progressive renal damage. One hundred and fifty-two children (including 78 girls) with a mean age of 20 months (range 1 month to 12 years) with first febrile UTI were evaluated by DMSA scintigraphy during acute UTI. After acute UTI, children were explored by voiding cysto-urethrography. Children who presented an abnormal DMSA study, or a normal DMSA study but VUR or recurrent UTI, underwent a DMSA control study 6 months after UTI. Children with VUR were followed up by direct radionuclide cystography. DMSA scintigraphy performed during acute UTI was normal in 112 children (74%). In 95 of these children, follow-up DMSA scintigraphy was not performed owing to a good clinical outcome. In the remaining 17 children, follow-up scintigraphy was normal. Forty children (26%) presented abnormal DMSA study during acute UTI. Twenty-five of them presented a normal follow-up DMSA, and 15 presented cortical lesions. Children with abnormal DMSA had a higher frequency of VUR than children with normal DMSA (48% vs 12%). It is concluded that children with normal DMSA during acute UTI have a low risk of renal damage. Children with normal follow-up DMSA and low-grade VUR have more frequent spontaneous resolution of VUR."

CD010657,0,9352548,0,A follow-up study of vesico-ureteric reflux and renal scars in asymptomatic siblings of children with reflux.,"The objectives of this study were to follow up children with vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) and renal scars, to evaluate kidney growth and to determine the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) and elevated blood pressure in 40 asymptomatic siblings of children with VUR, in whom VUR had been detected at an early age, and to gather additional data which could help to evaluate the need for screening for VUR in asymptomatic siblings. During the follow-up period of 3-7 years, two children (5%) had UTI; 66% of VUR grade 1 and 2 disappeared. The progression of scars was only detected in two of nine children with renal scars on the initial study, both of whom had high-grade VUR. Renal ultrasound was normal in all siblings and none developed hypertension. The results indicate that low-grade sterile VUR may not play a major role in renal scarring, but this may not be the case with high-grade sterile VUR. Considering the correlations among VUR, UTI and reflux nephropathy, routine screening for VUR at an early age in asymptomatic siblings of children with VUR seems to be justified to identify those at the greatest risk of subsequent renal damage."

In only four kidneys, showing reflux radiologically, was this not observed on the isotope examination; in view of the low radiation dose, the catheter-free isotope method can be recommended as the most suitable investigation. The need for serial investigations or contrast allergies are important indications for using this method. The relatively high frequency with which reflux shown by the isotope method could not be confirmed radiologically (nine kidneys) indicates that the isotope is more sensitive than the radiological investigation."

Twenty-eight girls and three boys (aged 19 days to 10 years; mean, 30 months) were operated on between 1968 and 1994. Twenty-four of the children presented for evaluation of dribbling urinary incontinence and/or febrile urinary tract infections; seven presented after prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis of hydronephrosis. The location of the ectopic orifice was identified in 25 children: bladder neck (6), posterior urethra (6), vagina (7), and vestibule (6). Upper pole nephroureterectomy was performed in 16 children who had nonfunctioning renal segments. Ureterovesical reimplantation was performed in 10 children who had functioning segments. In five borderline cases, temporary cutaneous ureterostomy was performed, followed by ureteropyelostomy (2), ureterovesical reimplantation (2), and upper pole nephrectomy (1). Histological examination of the polar nephrectomy specimens showed lesions of dysplasia in only four cases (24%). The follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 20 years (mean, 66 months). All children who presented with incontinence became continent after polar nephrectomy or conservative surgery. One child required surgical revision of the ureteropyelostomy anastomosis.

A total of 143 cases with confirmed UTI all received renal sonography (RS), voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and IVP, to evaluate for G-U tract anomaly. Associated G-U tract anomalies were noted in 67 cases (46.85%). No single method was adequate in detecting all abnormalities. Based on the anomalies detected, we proposed and compared two different conditions in which IVP was required. In condition A, in which IVP was performed when abnormal finding were found in RS or VCUG, 67 of 143 cases with UTI (46.85%, 67/143) were required to have IVP, among them 32 cases yielded positive results and 35 cases negative results. Two cases of duplex collecting system (DCS) were found only on IVP would be completely undetected under this proposed condition. However, when IVP was recommended and performed at the time of high grade VUR in VCUG or any abnormality in RS (condition B), 43 of 143 patients (30%, 43/143) with UTI were required to undergo IVP, yielding abnormal findings in 30 cases (70%, 30/43) and normal findings in 13. This would leave four cases of DCS undetected, including the 2 detectable only by IVP plus 2 more that showed low grade VUR on VCUG.

The third trimester renal sonography is the most important to detect hydronephrosis amenable to treatment.Classically, the prenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis, unilateral renal agenesis, or MDKD initiates postnatal investigations, including sonography, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and isotopic renography. The exact degree of renal pelvic dilatation that requires full postnatal investigation is still not entirely resolved. Most authors accept the upper limit of 7 mm for the AP diameter of the renal pelvis. The US examination should be performed after the physiological dehydration period, namely 3-5 days after birth, in an urgent case on the 1st day. A meticulous ultrasound examination performed by a physician who is familiar with the renal abnormalities shows the whole extent of underlying pathology.

Overall, 7 (22.6%) of the 31 were symptomatic (recurrent urinary tract infections, abdominal pain, hypertension, hydronephrosis), while 77.4% (24/31) were completely free of symptoms at the time of follow-up. Ultrasound revealed that the ectopic kidney was on the left in 64.5% (20/31) of these cases. Nuclear scans performed both at the time of the initial diagnosis and at follow-up were available for 11 of the 31 children and showed a mild improvement of the partial function of the pelvic kidney, from a mean of 25.6% to a mean of 34.6%. In conclusion, whenever renal agenesis is suspected on ultrasonographic examination, the investigator should first consider renal ectopia; ultrasound examination with the bladder full is the definitive diagnostic procedure. For asymptomatic cases we recommend regular ultrasound monitoring of the kidney -- at first every 6 months and later once a year. In cases with complex anatomy MRI is a suitable method for further diagnostic work-up."
CD010657,0,17684074,0,Vesicoureteric reflux in the adult.,"Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a well-recognized entity in the paediatric population, but is not well described or understood in the adult population. This is partly explained by the fact that its incidence declines with advancing age. Its diagnosis is, however, still important, with VUR accounting for at least 10% of adult patients with end-stage renal disease. With early detection and careful management, the secondary complications of VUR such as renal failure can be prevented. Imaging plays a major role in the detection and evaluation of VUR in the adult patient. Conventional techniques such as micturating cystourethrograms have now been supplemented by cross-sectional imaging with CT and MRI. In this review article, we comprehensively review the up to date status of imaging the adult patient with VUR and discuss important subgroups of patients such as pregnant and transplant patients."

The study material comprised 124 consecutive infants and children referred to uroradiological workup, usually because of a relapsing febrile urinary tract infection. Both examinations were done during the same session. Consistent findings were obtained on 232 ureters, of which 37 displayed II. and 19 III. + reflux. II. reflux was found in 12 ureters by cystography only; thus one-fourth of low-grade refluxes escaped the diagnosis by ultrasound. The false negative findings of ultrasound examination included also two ureters showing III. reflux in cystography. As calculated for therapy-requiring (grade III or higher) reflux, the sensitivity of ultrasound was 90 per cent and its specificity 100 per cent. We conclude that ultrasound can be used as a primary diagnostic technique for girls, and in the follow-up of both boys and girls."

CD010657,0,9142619,1,Use of ultrasonography in the detection of ureteric reflux in children suspected of having urinary infection.,"The present study investigated whether ultrasonography was effective in detecting ureteric reflux in children suspected of having urinary infection. Seventeen children with febrile episodes and pyuria were enrolled. The ultrasound examination revealed ballooning of the renal pelvis during bladder contraction in 4 children, dilatation of the distal ureters in 6, and small kidney in 2. Cystography was performed on the 6 children with these ultrasound abnormalities and 1 child with two episodes of suspected urinary infection. Four children showed reflux. All of the 4 children had been found to have renal pelvic ballooning on ultrasound. None of the 10 children who did not undergo cystography had recurrence of urinary infection or significant bacteriuria during a median follow-up period of 12 months. Thus, scanning during bladder contraction was effective in detecting significant ureteric reflux."

All the patients were assessed for VUR grade by voiding cystoureterography and for presence of renal scarring by (99 m) technetium dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy. All infants with VUR were given low-dose prophylactic antibiotics and followed-up until resolution of the reflux. Grade of reflux and number of urinary tract infection (UTI) episodes (≥3) were found to be statistically significant risk factors for renal scarring (P <0.05). However, gender, familial history and laterality of the disease were not found to be statistically significant risk factors (P >0.05). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference of frequency of renal scarring among the different age groups (P >0.05). We conclude that recurrences of UTI and VUR severity are significant risk factors for renal scarring in children with VUR. Therefore, identification of VUR at an early age may offer the opportunity to prevent episodes of UTI and possible formation of renal scars that may result in end-stage renal failure."

Abdominal distension, electrolyte imbalance, and an elevated BUN/serum creatinine ratio were noted at the time of hospitalization in both cases. These laboratory values promptly returned to normal after the establishment of appropriate urinary drainage, accomplished through bladder catheterization in case 1 and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy in case 2.

CD010657,0,16079971,0,[Modern imaging technology for childhood urinary tract infection].,"Imaging in childhood urinary tract infection (UTI) is still a matter of debate. There are established guidelines, however new knowledge and the changed medical environment have enhanced this ongoing discussion. These new insights have impacted therapy and consequently the imaging algorithm. Modern imaging methods -- particularly MRI and modern ultrasound (US) -- are less invasive with a lower radiation burden. Additionally, it has been shown that VUR is a poor predictor for renal scarring out, which affects long-term results. Furthermore, the majority of UT malformations is depicted by prenatal US. The most crucial aspect of improving long-term outcome appears to be the early and reliable depiction of UTI and effective treatment to prevent renal scarring. This review tries to present this new knowledge and to discuss the potential of modern imaging. Recent changes in imaging algorithms are highlighted and an outcome-oriented algorithm that addresses these recent developments is proposed, without lightly abandoning established standards. It consists of an orienting US and -- for depiction of renal involvement -- amplitude coded color Doppler sonography or renal static scintigraphy (considered the gold standard, particularly for evaluating scars); in future MRI may play a role. Based on this concept, only patients with renal damage as well as patients with complex urinary tract malformations or intractable recurrent UTI may have to undergo VCUG."

This ear feature was only recorded in 16 cases among 100 control children. The observation of abnormalities of the auricle (flattened structure of the pinna, deformed shape of the helix) should thus prompt to investigate a possible urinary tract malformation (vesico-renal reflux, mega-ureter). The identification of this disorder should occur as early as possible in order to perform corrective surgery before irreversible kidney damage. Any urinary disorder associated to atypical morphology of the external ear should lead to abdominal echography. Urinary infections, sometimes mistaken for upper respiratory tract infections, will sometimes provide a diagnostic lead, confirmed by cyto-bacteriological examination of urine. These observations further confirm the concomitant development of the external ear and urinary tract during embryogenesis."

Sonography was performed during UTI and about one month later. UTI was classified as upper and lower UTI according to the clinical and laboratory findings; radiological investigations (voiding cystoureterography = MCU) were performed in all infants. 40 infants were classified to have upper UTI. There was a high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for detection of renal involvement by sonography. Incidence for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was significantly higher in infants with repeated pathological findings on sonography. In contrast, no VUR was detected on MCU in all 12 infants with normal findings in both sonographic examinations. Yet, sonography without catheterization could not detect VUR in all infants with radiologically confirmed reflux. Our results show, that sonography is of definite value in infants with UTI, but cannot replace radiological work up."

The target population is limited to children between 2 months and 2 years of age who are examined because of fever without an obvious cause. Diagnosis and management of UTI in this group are especially challenging for these three reasons: 1) the manifestation of UTI tends to be nonspecific, and cases may be missed easily; 2) clean voided midstream urine specimens rarely can be obtained, leaving only urine collection methods that are invasive (transurethral catheterization or bladder tap) or result in nonspecific test results (bag urine); and 3) a substantial number of infants with UTI also may have structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract that put them at risk for ongoing renal damage, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD)."

CD010657,0,8877352,0,One-stage reconstruction of bladder exstrophy.,"From 1984 to 1990 a primary one-stage reconstruction of bladder exstrophy was performed at our hospital on 15 consecutive infants. Reconstruction included Cohen's ureteral reimplantation, bladder neck reconstruction according to Young-Dees, bladder closure, symphyseal bone approximation, abdominal wall closure, and repair of epispadias in females. Postoperatively, all patients were immobilized by overhead extension. Iliac osteotomy was done in 9 children, but was abandoned in recent years for infants less than one month old Follow-up examinations included an interview with the parents, clinical examinations, blood and urine analyses, uroflowmetry, and ultrasound scan of the abdomen. Nuclear renal scan, i.v. pyelography, and cystography were carried out as indicated. At the time of last evaluation the children were between 3 and 9 years of age. The cosmetic results were satisfactory in all cases. Eight of 15 children were dry day and night with micturition intervals more than 3 hours during day time (complete continence). Five children were dry during day time with micturition intervals up to 3 hours, but occasionally wet their beds (partial continence). Two children were incontinent. Eleven of 15 children had a bladder capacity of more than 100 ml. Renal function was normal in all patients. Two children showed a mild VUR, and no other abnormalities of the upper urinary tracts were found. Iliac osteotomy did not influence the functional or cosmetic results, but in two patients asymmetry of pelvic bones with consecutive lumbar scoliosis was found. Comparing these results with reports on staged reconstructive procedures, we conclude that by primary complete one-stage reconstruction a well acceptable success rate is achieved, and that by this method possibly some advantages are offered to patients with bladder exstrophy."
CD010657,0,12488985,0,Cystosonography and voiding cystourethrography in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux.,"The availability of US (ultrasonography) contrast media in the last few years has prompted investigation into their use in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children, a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) or pyelonephritis. We performed voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and cystosonography (CSG) in the same session in 158 children (M/F 97/61, mean age 3.9 years, age range 0.1-12.7 years) with clinical suspicion of VUR, studied over a year with an ATL plus 3000 real-time scanner (ATL Ultrasound, Bothell, USA), equipped with 2- to 4- and 4- to 7-MHz convex transducers. US contrast medium Levovist (Schering, Berlin, Germany) was used. VCUG and CSG diagnosed 74 (24.2%) and 77 (25.2%) cases of VUR, respectively. There was no agreement in 67 cases (22%). The percentage of false negatives was similar and high with both techniques. CSG seems to be more sensitive in detecting intermediate (second- and third-degree) VUR. In spite of the moderate relative diagnostic adequacy of both methods, we believe that CSG is an alternative to VCUG, avoiding the risk of ionizing radiation, in the following conditions: (1) first diagnosis in females (not in males, due to the poor vesical and urethral anatomical detail it provides), (2) VUR follow-up, (3) VUR diagnosis in megaureters and/or in ureteroceles, and (4) VUR diagnosis in transplanted kidneys. Further improvements of CSG, both in US contrast media and in US technique, could possibly increase its sensitivity."

We applied the principles of SPECT imaging to renal cortical scintigraphy in the assessment of renal defects. We evaluated retrospectively 35 children who were undergoing 99mtechnetium-glucoheptonate renal cortical scintigraphy. Each child underwent planar, SPECT and pinhole imaging. Of the 35 children 9 had normal systems bilaterally and the remaining 26 had at least 1 defect in 1 or both kidneys. Over-all, we identified 29 abnormal renal units. Planar imaging identified 59% of the defects, while pinhole and SPECT imaging identified 83% of the defects. When combining any 2 studies (that is planar and pinhole, planar and SPECT or pinhole and SPECT) we were able to identify 97% of the defects, which approached but was not statistically significant at p = 0.09. When data from all 3 studies were combined 100% of the defects were identified, which was a statistically significant increase in defects noted when compared to only planar images (p = 0.016). SPECT imaging was found to be a technically feasible undertaking with conventional equipment, although its clinical applicability at this time is limited."
CD010657,0,10353409,1,Comparison of ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy changes in acute pyelonephritis.,"The strategy for morphological investigations in children with acute pyelonephritis (APN) remains debatable. We studied 70 children (median age 2.0 years) admitted with a first episode of pyelonephritis using a high-resolution ultrasound technique (RUS) and compared the results with 99m technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy. The DMSA scan was abnormal in 62 children (89%). However, using a high-frequency transducer we found abnormal sonogram changes in 61 children (87%), consisting of an increased kidney volume in 42, and/or a thickening of the wall of the renal pelvis in 42, and/or a focal hyper- or hypoechogenicity in 36, and/or a diffuse hyperechogenicity in 31 children. Micturating cystourethrography was performed in all children, revealing vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in 22 (31%). Among those children with VUR, 4 had a normal DMSA scan, 2 an abnormal RUS, and 2 a normal DMSA scan and RUS. Our data suggest that B-mode RUS performed with a high-frequency transducer by a trained radiologist is nearly as sensitive as the DMSA scan in diagnosing renal involvement in children with unobstructed APN and in predicting VUR."

CD010657,0,18924514,0,[Urinary tract infections--pediatric urologist point of view].,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) could present with different clinical forms dependent on intensity and localization of infection and child's age. The symptoms could be non specific in children. Condition that provoke to urinary stasis, especially voiding dysfunction is the favourable factor for UTI appearance. Gram-negative enteric bacteria is the most common pathogen. Urine culture is the basic investigation that allow to identify pathogen and its drug sensitiveness but simultaneous urinalysis is necessary to recognize the inflammation of urinary organs. In addition, the number of leukocytes gives an idea about inflammation intensity. Ultrasonographic (USG) scan is necessary to examine urostasis. DMSA study performed during febrile UTI allow to identify children with acute pyelonephritis and when repeated 6 months later - those with renal scars. A normal USG and DMSA scan during infection makes voiding cystourethrography (VCU) unnecessary in the primary examination. The presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) not always predispose children to renal lesions. Early and appropriate treatment of UTI, especially during the first 24 hours, diminishes the likelihood of renal involvement during the acute phase of infection but does not prevent scar formation. The proper hygiene of the urethral meatus, voiding and drinking habits and preventing of constipation are crucial in UTI prophylaxis."

CD010657,0,15558286,0,Initial and long-term management of posterior urethral valves.,"Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of congenital obstructive uropathy, resulting in renal failure in childhood. Nowadays, in most cases, diagnosis is suggested by antenatal ultrasound. However, antenatal intervention has not resulted in a significantly improved outcome. Endoscopic valve ablation is the initial treatment in most of these neonates, but others procedures, like vesicostomy or ureterostomy, can also be justified in some particular cases in order to improve renal function prognosis. Different factors like bladder dysfunction, VUR, polyuria and proteinuria, can be responsible for the slow and progressive deterioration in renal function that some of these patients show over the years.

The frequency of persistent lesions in kidneys with mild-moderate lesions (less than 50% of kidney involvement) in the presence of VUR or in non-refluxing kidneys was similar (P=0.1447), while the frequency of persistent lesions in kidneys with severe lesions in the presence of VUR was significantly higher than the frequency of persistent lesions in non-refluxing kidneys (P=0.0089). The extent of kidney involvement and the presence of VUR make possible the identification of different categories of risk of scarring: in the ""low risk group"" (normal kidney with/without VUR) the risk of scarring is 0%; in the ""intermediate risk group"" (mild lesions with/without VUR; extensive lesions without VUR) the risk of scarring is between 14% and 38%, while in the ""high risk group"" (extensive lesions with VUR) the risk of scarring is 88%.

Six patients required antihypertensive treatment, 30 (13% of girls, 17% of boys) had at least one episode of urinary tract infection. The number of clinical complications did not differ in patients who underwent nephrectomy in comparison to those who did not. The dysplastic kidney decreased in size in 65% of kidneys with repeated ultrasound values; no change occurred in 16%, while an increase in maximal diameter was observed in 19%. Contralateral kidney length of more than 2 standard deviation scores (SDS) was seen in 30% of patients. There is evidence for a slight impairment of renal function in the whole study group given by a median of serum creatinine level of 0.63 SDS in all patients available for analysis. Among those 35 patients with contralateral anomalies (mainly obstructive changes and vesico-ureteral reflux), all 3 patients with contralateral changes suggestive of hypoplasia and 22% with obstruction, but only 1/7 (14%) with reflux showed elevated serum creatinine level >2 SDS."
CD010657,0,18666470,0,[Procalcitonin and prediction of vesico-ureteral reflux in pediatric urinary tract infection].,"An estimated 7% of girls and 2% of boys will have a urinary tract infection before 6 years of age, and between 20 and 40% of these children are diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux. Reflux is a risk factor for recurrent infections and renal scarring, which can lead to hypertension and kidney failure. Pediatric guidelines recommend routine voiding cystourethrography, but this is a painful and expensive examination that exposes children to radiation. Reliable non invasive markers of reflux would therefore be extremely useful. Ultrasonography and clinical decision rules have poor sensitivity for vesicoureteral reflux. In contrast, the level of procalcitonin, a marker of the severity of bacterial infections, is a good predictor of cystographic findings in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. Indeed, a procalcitonin level below 0.5 ng/ml predicted the absence of radiological reflux with a sensitivity of more than 75% in the French princeps study. This was validated by a prospective European study, in which sensitivity reached 100% for high-grade reflux. Procalcitonin assay can thus avoid voiding cystourethrography in 40 to 50% of young children with febrile urinary tract infections."

Our findings are that less than 50% of the patients had infection. The others had a wide variety of apparent causes for the thickening which include obstruction, surgery, edema induced by chemicals and other processes. Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 50% of the patients studied by cystography. We concluded that renal pelvic thickening is a non-specific finding."

Subsequent fetal US identified progressive urinary tract dilatation, ascites and oligohydramnios. At 22 weeks, the fetal bladder was drained under US guidance. A gradual resolution of oligohydramnios was detected on US performed after 26 weeks of gestation. Delivery by cesarean section was performed at 34 weeks of gestation. The newborn had typical features of PBS with a vesico-cutaneous fistula but did not show respiratory distress. Imaging studies showed hypoplastic left kidney, slightly dysplastic but functioning right kidney, megaureter, megacystis, vesicoureteral reflux and dilated prostatic urethra. The early detection of genitourinary system abnormalities and serial US suggest that a distal urethral obstruction may be the underlying mechanism of PBS.

Excretory urography is done to search for anomalies predisposing to infection and for signs of previous episodes of pyelonephritis or reflux and to serve as a baseline for future studies. Voiding cystourethrography is done to search for abnormalities in the natural barriers that protect the renal medulla from infection. If reflux is found to be present and sequential reflux studies are done, they should be performed by the radionuclide method to observe changes in degree or cessation."

Even though this defect is common among siblings and parents of index patients (27-40%), the mode of inheritance is not well defined. Parents and siblings (three female and two male) of a 13-year-old girl with end-stage renal failure (ESRF) due to reflux nephropathy were screened for VUR although they had not presented episodes of urinary tract infection. VUR was identified in the father (44 years old) and in all the three sisters (aged 15 years, 16 years and 18 years) while the two brothers (aged 5 years and 8 years) had normal renal ultrasonograms and cystograms. A technetium-99m di-mercapto-succinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scan demonstrated renal scars in the father and in two of the sisters with VUR. No episodes of urinary infection had been documented for any relatives. Haplotype analysis on the X-chromosome confirmed paternity. This is the first description of VUR compatible with an X-dominant trait. This mode of inheritance must be added to what is already known on familial VUR, and future studies should also consider this possibility."
CD010657,0,20488488,1,Practice guidelines for imaging studies in children after the first urinary tract infection.,Urinary tract infection is common in children and may be associated with significant urinary tract pathology. Many children are investigated for vesicoureteral reflux after the first urinary tract infection but less than a quarter have reflux. Imaging with voiding cystourethrogram is not without risk. An approach was proposed to predict reflux in children with a urinary tract infection. We sought to validate a preestablished clinical decision rule to target voiding cystourethrogram more efficiently in children after the first urinary tract infection.

CD010657,0,17618429,0,Voiding urosonography with ultrasound contrast agents for the diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux in children. I. Procedure.,"Voiding urosonography (VUS) encompasses examination of the urinary tract with intravesical administration of US contrast agent (UCA) for diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). The real breakthrough for US examination of VUR came with the availability of stabilized UCAs in the mid-1990s. This article presents a comprehensive review of various procedural aspects of VUS. Different US modalities are available for detecting the echogenic microbubbles: fundamental mode, colour Doppler US, harmonic imaging and dedicated contrast imaging with multiple display options. The reflux is graded (1 to 5) in a similar manner to the system used in voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). The most commonly used UCA for VUS, Levovist, is galactose-based and contains air-filled microbubbles. The recommended concentration is 300 mg/ml at a dose of 5-10%, or less than 5%, of the bladder filling volume when using fundamental or harmonic imaging modes, respectively. There are preliminary reports of VUS using a second-generation UCA, SonoVue. Here the UCA volume is less than 1% of the bladder filling volume. There is no specific contraindication to intravesical administration of UCA. The safety profile of intravesical Levovist is very high with no reports of side effects over a decade of use in VUS."

I describe here a case of reflux nephropathy in a patient with crossed renal ectopia with fusion. A 14-year-old boy was referred to our hospital for further examination of proteinuria, detected by the school's annual urinary screening program. Laboratory study revealed proteinuria and renal insufficiency. Abdominal computed tomography and voiding cystography disclosed crossed renal ectopia with fusion and vesicoureteral reflux in each moiety. Renal biopsy of the orthotopic kidney showed diffuse interstitial fibrosis and mononuclear cell infiltration, periglomerular fibrosis, glomerular hypertrophy, and focal and global glomerulosclerosis, which were compatible with reflux nephropathy.

CD010657,0,12666492,0,[Management of isolated fetal dilatations of the kidney pelvis].,"The most common sonographic abnormality found in the fetal urinary tract is collecting system dilatation, accounting for 4.5% of examinations. Numerous renal pelvis measurements and various gestational age cut-off points have been recommended in the assessment of obstructive fetal uropathy. As a result, renal pelvic measurements are not well standardized. The first measurements of the renal pelvis diameter in the 80's suggested that a threshold value of 10 mm was significant in order to distinguish between physiologic and pathologic dilatations. The routine use of prenatal ultrasound and the improving resolution of ultrasound equipment allow the detection of smaller dilatations. The third-trimester threshold value for the antero-posterior renal pelvis diameter of 7 mm is the best ultrasound criterion to predict postnatal renal abnormalities with a positive predictive value of 69%. A renal pelvis dilatation during the second trimester of pregnancy can be used as a warning sign for urinary tract malformation, and should not be ignored even if there is no further progression in the third trimester, because this finding may reveal a significant urologic abnormality in 12% of cases. Isolated pyelectasis can signal the presence of vesico-ureteral reflux. Normal appearing urinary tract on 2 successive neonatal ultrasound rarely coexist with significant abnormal findings on voiding cysto-urethrography. Therefore, in such cases, invasive investigations are not justified."

Sixteen infants had bilateral reflux--a total of 41 refluxing units. The high proportion of males (84%) contrasts with clinically presenting reflux, which is dominated by females. Prenatally diagnosed reflux is generally of a higher grade--usually grade IV. Eight children (32%) had coexistent congenital abnormalities. Chemoprophylaxis was completely effective in 17 children (68%), who remained infection-free; 3 children (12%) had a single urinary infection and were managed conservatively whilst 5 (20%) experienced 2 or more infections and required reimplantation or vesicostomy. Spontaneous cessation of reflux was observed in 6 (35%) of 17 refluxing ureters reassessed after a mean interval of 2.1 years. The significance of isotope findings was sometimes difficult to assess but results in 30 refluxing units support the concept that focal renal scarring is usually a consequence of infected reflux in postnatal life."
CD010657,0,9017803,0,Ureteral duplication and its complications.,"Duplication of the ureters is a common anomaly and is frequently encountered by radiologists. Duplication may be either complete or incomplete and is often accompanied by various complications. Incomplete duplication is most often associated with ureteroureteral reflux or ureteropelvic junction obstruction of the lower pole of the kidney. Complete duplication is most often associated with vesicoureteral reflux, ectopic ureterocele, or ectopic ureteral insertion, all of which are more common in girls than in boys. Vesicoureteral reflux affects the lower pole and can be outgrown, as in nonduplicated systems. Ectopic ureterocele and ectopic ureteral insertion affect the upper pole. The ectopic ureterocele produces a filling defect of variable size in the bladder; it can be identified with contrast material studies or ultrasound. Ectopic ureters may function poorly, be difficult to detect, and cause enuresis in girls. A fourth complication, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, occurs only in the lower pole and is seen in more boys than girls. Anatomic variants or anomalies as well as suboptimal imaging techniques can either simulate or obscure duplication, making diagnosis difficult. However, familiarity with the embryology of duplication and an awareness of the potential pitfalls of excretory urography and voiding cystourethrography will foster an understanding of the varied appearances and associated complications of both incomplete and complete duplication."

A total of 11 studies were published between 1998 and 2007. Children with very high procalcitonin levels during urinary tract infections are likely to be at risk of renal damage and vesico-ureteral reflux. Therefore, the prediction of long-term renal damage showed contradictory results. However, high procalcitonin values at diagnosis and positive scintigraphic scans may suggest the need to investigate for vesico-ureteral reflux. Consequently, procalcitonin levels should be included in follow-up protocols for urinary tract infections to aid in decision making concerning scintigraphic scans and voiding cystourethrograms."

With the total number of scars serving as the gold standard, the sensitivity (94%) and specificity (100%) in identifying renal scars in children were highest for the DMSA scan. Intraobserver (95%) and interobserver (90%) reliability were also high for the DMSA scan. However, the clinical interpretation of the increased sensitivity of the DMSA scan is unknown.

However, postnatal management of AHN is controversial. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes of infants with AHN and to contribute to the definition of the postnatal evaluation of these patients. One hundred and thirty-six infants with AHN were prospectively followed up to 18 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to the degree of sonographic hydronephrosis (HN) on days 5-7: group I (n = 87, 64%) included patients who had grades 1 and 2 (64%) and group II (n = 49, 36%) included patients who had grade 3 and above HN. The grade of HN was found to be correlated with the increased risk of urologic pathologies. Frequency of vesicoureteral reflux was found to be significantly lower in patients with mild HN (6%) as compared to patients with severe AHN (29%) (p = 0.005). In addition, the risk of urinary tract infection increases with increasing grades of HN (10% vs. 29%, p = 0.006). The frequency of spontaneous resolution in patients with mild AHN (64%) was also significantly higher than in patients with severe HN (29%) (p < 0.001). The degree of AHN can be used for making decision about further diagnostic imaging and treatment. Our results strongly suggest that low-grade HN is a relatively self-limited condition and needs minimal investigation. In contrast, the outcome of more severe degrees of AHN needs clarification."

CD010657,0,21896378,0,CKD and bladder problems in children.,"Approximately 35% of children with CKD who require renal replacement therapy have a significant urological abnormality, including posterior urethral valves, a neuropathic bladder, prune belly syndrome, Hinman syndrome, or severe vesicoureteral reflux. In such children, abnormal bladder function can have a significant deleterious effect on the renal function. In children with bladder outlet obstruction, bladder compliance and capacity often are abnormal, and a sustained intravesical pressure of >40 cm H(2)O impedes drainage from the upper urinary tract. Consequently, in these conditions, regular evaluation with renal sonography, urodynamics, urine culture, and serum chemistry needs to be performed. Pediatric urological care needs to be coordinated with pediatric nephrologists. Many boys with posterior urethral valves have severe polyuria, resulting in chronic bladder overdistension, which is termed as valve bladder. In addition to behavioral modification during the day, such patients may benefit from overnight continuous bladder drainage, which has been shown to reduce hydronephrosis and stabilize or improve renal function in most cases. In children with a neuropathic bladder, detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia is the most likely cause for upper tract deterioration due to secondary vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, and recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). Pharmacologic bladder management and frequent intermittent catheterization are necessary. In some cases, augmentation cystoplasty is recommended; however, this procedure has many long-term risks, including UTI, metabolic acidosis, bladder calculi, spontaneous perforation, and malignancy. Nearly half of children with prune belly syndrome require renal replacement therapy. Hinman syndrome is a rare condition with severe detrusor-sphincter discoordination that results in urinary incontinence, encopresis, poor bladder emptying, and UTI, often resulting in renal impairment. Children undergoing evaluation for renal transplantation need a thorough evaluation of the lower urinary tract, mostly including a voiding cystourethrogram and urodynamic studies."

Investigations included early 99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan (which was performed at a median of 27 days), ultrasonography, micturating cysto-urethrography and indirect voiding radionuclide cystography using 99mTc DTPA. Follow-up DMSA scan was carried out after 6 months. Twenty-one of 102 of initial DMSA studies showed diminished uptake of radionuclide and 12 showed cortical scarring. Twenty-nine patients had significant vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The finding of diminished uptake on the initial scan was significantly associated with fever, systemic upset, length of symptoms and a peripheral blood leucocytosis, (p less than 0.05). In addition the finding was associated with fever and loin pain in the older child. Both diminished uptake and scarring were more common in refluxing kidney units. We propose that, in children with UTI, diminished uptake on early DMSA scan localises infection in the renal parenchyma."

CD010657,0,15088914,0,Ultrasonic measurement of bladder weight as a novel urodynamic modality.,"Although pressure-flow studies (PFS) are currently recognized as the gold standard for the diagnosis of infravesical obstruction, their clinical use is limited, due to the invasive nature of procedure. Recently, we developed a new urodynamic parameter, ultrasound estimated bladder weight (UEBW), which was calculated from the bladder wall thickness measured ultrasonically and intravesical volume. Our comparative study between UEBW and PFS showed that UEBW diagnosed infravesical obstruction with a diagnosis accuracy of 73% using a cut-off value of 35 gm. UEBW could also be used as a reliable tool in monitoring therapeutic effects on BPH patients in terms of the relief of obstruction. In addition, UEBW is of clinical use in the management of neurogenic bladder dysfunction, in which there was a significant negative correlation noted between UEBW and bladder compliance. Consequently, UEBW could be a reliable predictor for a low-compliant bladder. Since UEBW can be obtained non-invasively, it is readily applicable to pediatric urology. In healthy children, UEBW increased significantly with age. For the evaluation of UEBW in an individual child patient, the deviation from age-matched UEBW, obtained from the formula of the linear correlation between UEBW and age, was employed. In our recent studies, the deviation from age-matched UEBW is likely to be used as a predictor for bladder dysfunction in children, such as secondary vesicoureteral reflux and a low-compliant bladder. In conclusion, UEBW is promising as a non-invasive urodynamic modality capable of evaluating bladder hypertrophy with its functional abnormalities."

CD010657,0,12579398,0,Renin-angiotensin system polymorphisms and renal scarring.,"The purpose of the study was to determine whether DNA polymorphisms at the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) genes were associated with evolution to renal scar formation and, consequently, with reflux nephropathy (RN) in patients with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Some authors have suggested that the DD genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene would be an adverse renal prognosis factor. We recruited 246 patients (aged 3 months to 22 years) from four Spanish hospitals. These included 69 patients with VUR, 110 with RN (determined by absence/presence of renal scarring on dimercaptosuccinc acid scan), 27 with chronic renal failure due to RN, and 40 patients (control group) with urinary tract infection and normal findings on renal ultrasonography and voiding cystoureterogram. The ACE I/D, angiotensin II type 1 receptor AT1 A1166C, angiotensin II type 2 receptor A3123C AT2, and angiotensinogen AGT M235T polymorphisms were determined on the basis of polymerase chain reaction amplification. ACE serum levels were determined by spectrophotometric methods. We found no statistical differences in the distribution of RAS polymorphisms between the different groups. The ACE D allele was linked to higher ACE serum levels. We found no association between ACE I/D polymorphism and presence of hypertension, proteinuria, grade of VUR, or unilateral/bilateral VUR. Patients with the DD genotype had a lower incidence of febrile urinary tract infection as a first symptom of VUR/RN (P<0.05). We conclude that genetic polymorphisms of RAS components are not independent prognostic indicators of renal scarring in patients with VUR."

CD010657,0,15290204,0,The role of imaging in urinary tract infections.,"The aim of imaging in urinary tract infections (UTI) is to detect conditions that must be corrected to avoid imminent deterioration of kidney function, or to prevent recurrent infections and long-term kidney damage. The most threatening conditions are obstruction of an infected upper tract and abscesses of the genitourinary system. An image-guided percutaneous drainage can be lifesaving. The role of imaging in small children with UTI is controversial in terms of the importance of anatomical and functional disorders in relation to the preventive measures to be taken. In newborns identified with hydronephrosis during pregnancy or by neonatal screening, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal scarring are congenital and not caused by infection. Most of these patients are males and the VUR is of a higher grade than VUR detected in girls after the first UTI. Imaging in children with UTI should only be ordered after a thorough evaluation of the risk of renal damage and the benefits of preventive measures. In adult females, no imaging is necessary in cystitis, while ultrasonography and plain films are recommended in acute pyelonephritis. Since uncomplicated UTI in men is rare, diagnostic imaging should be started early to rule out complicating factors in the urinary tract. In prostatitis, vesiculitis, epididymitis and orchitis the role of imaging is to rule out abscess formation and testicular malignancies."

Of the units 6 had grade I reflux, 16 grade II, 23 grade III, 14 grade IV and 6 grade V. Only patients with primary reflux were included in this study. The success rate was 100% for grades I to III, 92.9% for grade IV and 66.7% for grade V. Overall, the reflux was cured in 62 of the 65 operated renal units (95.4%) or 95.6% of the patients (43 of 45). Postoperative morbidity and complications were minimal. No cases of postoperative obstruction were detected on excretory urography 6 weeks postoperatively. Seven children (16%) suffered from transient inadequate bladder emptying as assessed by post-void ultrasound residual evaluations. This problem resolved spontaneously after a maximum of 4 weeks of clean intermittent catheterization.

CD010657,0,9924638,1,Should renal ultrasonography be done routinely in children with first urinary tract infection?,"To reassess the impact of renal ultrasonography on the care of children with first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) we conducted a computer search and review of medical records of (1) all children who were admitted to our hospital with first febrile urinary tract infection and underwent renal ultrasonography during a 25-month period beginning February 1, 1995, (2) all children diagnosed by ultrasound to have hydronephrosis during the same time period. Of a total of 124 patients with UTI, renal ultrasound appeared normal or showed evidence of acute pyelonephritis in 105 (84.7%), and in another nine (7.2%) it showed only minor findings. In 10 children (8.1%) ultrasound showed hydronephrosis and/or hydroureter. In eight of the latter 10, voiding cystourethrography showed vesicoureteral reflux; in one, posterior urethral valves; and in one, who had a unilateral nonobstructed dilatated system, cystography appeared normal. Except for the last patient, who was given prophylactic antibiotics and continued to have urinary tract infections, in no other case did ultrasound alone have any impact on the patient's management. Four children with both abnormal-appearing renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography required surgical intervention. One hundred of the 124 children had a voiding cystourethrogram. In 38 children it detected vesicoureteral reflux and, in another two, bladder abnormalities. Thirty-five of those with abnormal-appearing cystogram but without an indication for surgery were given prophylactic antibiotics. During the same 25-month period, 63 children without urinary tract infection were diagnosed by ultrasound with hydronephrosis. In 45 of them (71.4%) the urologic abnormality had already been detected by prenatal ultrasound. Fourteen of these 45 children (31.1%) required surgery, all for congenital anomalies related to obstructive uropathy. We conclude that routine renal ultrasonography in children with first urinary tract infection has negligible influence on their clinical management. This seems to be due to the recent widespread use, in industrialized countries, of maternal-fetal ultrasonography, which already detects a significant number of children with congenital obstructive uropathy prenatally. On the other hand imaging of the lower urinary tract is of high yield and contributes significantly to patient care. Therefore, whereas imaging of the lower urinary tract should continue to be done routinely in children with first urinary tract infection, renal ultrasound may be reserved for more select cases."

CD010657,0,9639626,0,Upper-tract changes after treatment of posterior urethral valves.,"This paper discusses the long-term sequelae in the upper urinary tract with respect to hydroureteronephrosis (HUN), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), renal parenchymal disease, and their correlation with renal function in 84 boys with posterior urethral valves followed for 1 to 21 years. Thirty-one boys (39.3%) were adolescents or older at the time of review. The incidence of high-grade VUR (grade III or more) was 47.6% at presentation, and resolution following decompression of the lower urinary tract occurred in 38.7% of refluxing units. VUR was associated with a high incidence of chronic renal failure (CRF) (30%) on long-term follow up; however, 16% of non-refluxing patients also progressed to CRF. The incidences of renal parenchymal disease and persistent upper-tract dilatation in the non-refluxing group were 25% and 50% of renal units respectively. Gross HUN persisted in 12.3% of patients despite decompression and reconstructive surgery, with vesicoureteral junction (VUJ) obstruction being documented in 1 patient only. Moderate and mild upper-tract dilatation persisted in 31.6% and 43.9% of patients, respectively. Persistent gross HUN was associated with a very high incidence of CRF (92.3%), while 88.4% of those with persistent mild/moderate dilatation maintained normal renal function over a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 21 years. This study emphasizes the need for systematic evaluation to exclude VUJ obstruction and abnormal urodynamics as a cause of persistent HUN so that effective therapy can be instituted early to relieve back-pressure and to provide a low-pressure reservoir with effective emptying. In the absence of either of these causes, persistent ureterectasis after treatment is presumably due to secondary peristaltic failure as a consequence of ureteral fibrosis, ureteral tortuosity, or developmental dysplasia."

CD010657,0,21322515,0,Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in children.,"Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins.

CD010657,0,7779526,0,Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of renal parenchymal damage by 99mTc-DMSA planar and SPECT scintigraphy.,"The initial 99mTc-DMSA studies carried out over a four year period in 229 patients with various heterogenic causes of lower urinary tract abnormalities were reviewed. Anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma was graded by means of planar and SPECT studies into a six group classification proposed by Monsour et al.: grade 0 (normal), I (equivocal), II (single defect), III (more than 2 defects), IV (contracted or small) and V (no visualization). Parenchymal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA was quantitated from planar images at 2 hours postinjection by a computer assisted gamma camera method. SPECT studies could enhance the pick-up rate for parenchymal uptake defects by a factor of 1.5 in comparison with planar imaging. The incidence of anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma increased with a high radiological grade for VUR, and renal uptake per injection dose of 99mTc-DMSA by the individual kidney significantly decreased in grades III and IV of the anatomical classification. These data revealed that 99mTc-DMSA planar is still useful for evaluating gross structural damage and for quantitative evaluation of the kidney with computer assistance. SPECT scintigraphy is more effective in disclosing anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma than planar, although it needs further discussion as to whether SPECT may increase sensitivity with minimal or no adverse affect on specificity."
CD010657,0,16967282,0,Mild hydronephrosis in newborns and infants: can ultrasound predict the presence of vesicoureteral reflux.,"The objective of our study was to determine the significance of mild hydronephrosis in newborns and infants as an indicator of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) of 573 patients aged 0-18 months with mild, sonographically detected hydronephrosis were reviewed for VUR. Patients with secondary reflux or anomalies making an exact reflux grading impossible were excluded. Normal kidneys, contralateral to hydronephrotic ones, were included. Each kidney was considered separately, forming a total of 1,146 renal units. Mild hydronephrosis was defined as an anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis of 0.5-1.5 cm without caliectasis. The International Grading System was used to grade VUR. Seven hundred and thirty-six kidneys had mild hydronephrosis. VUR occurred in 189 out of 736 (25.7%) of these kidneys, and in 108 out of 410 (26.3%) non-distended kidneys, contralateral to hydronephrotic ones (p=0.806). No statistical differences in the frequency of VUR and dilatation were found between the subgroups of patients with and without infection, except for a higher grade of reflux in the group with infection. The frequency of VUR in mildly dilated kidneys was not significantly different from that in non-distended ones. There was a poor correlation between VUR and mild hydronephrosis. The latter should not be considered in itself an indication for VCUG in asymptomatic neonates and infants."

Despite its prevalence, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the clinical impact after birth. Prognosis depends on the severity of the dilation. Expectant prenatal management is the rule with fetal intervention rarely needed in a few select cases.

Two groups were compared: 49 who presented with a urinary tract infection and 39 who were identified through prospective screening. Based on the distribution of grade and the presence of parenchymal scarring, the severity of vesicoureteral reflux was comparable in the two groups. Of note, more males with reflux were identified in the noninfected group, whereas sex distribution was almost equal in the infected group. Ultrasound alone was found to be highly inaccurate in identifying reflux or parenchymal changes. In conclusion, screening of at-risk groups of children without a history of urinary tract infection may identify patients with clinically significant vesicoureteral reflux."

The treatment was carried on in Department of Pediatric Surgery in Poznan between 1983 and 1992. All these children were operated on with antireflux Politano-Leadbetter technique, modified by Sarrazin, protecting reimplanted ureters with stenting catheters. Duplicated ureters were reimplanted ""en bloc"" according to Bettex technique, also with Sarrazin modification. Preoperative parameters included: history, radiological evaluations: voiding cystourethrogram, intravenous pyelogram or ultrasound imaging, endoscopic evaluations--cystourethroscopy (with meatal calibration in girls), laboratory blood and urine results. The reflux degree was estimated according to international classification IRSC. There were 12 (2%) children with II degree, 498 (80%) with III degree, 101 (16%) with IV degree and 11 (2%) patients with V degree reflux. In order to compare the results of operative treatment, all analyzed children were subdivided into groups: 303 (48.7%) patients with primary reflux, 77 (12%) with reflux to duplicated pyelo-ureteral systems, 17 (2.7%) with refluxing megaureters, 66 (10%) with reflux to hypoplastic kidney, 99 (15.9%) with cystic cystitis and 114 (18%) children with urethral meatal stricture. Good recovery with uncomplicated postoperative course was obtained in 606 (97.4%) patients. Early postoperative complications occurred in 16 (2.6%). In outpatient control the results of urinalysis and urine cultures, ultrasound imaging and voiding cystourethrograms were tested. Urine cultures were negative in 501 (80.5%) patients 3-4 weeks after discharge increasing to above 92% of patients 6 months after operation. In postoperative imaging control, 600 (96.5%) patients presented with normal status of upper urinary tract, in 14 (2.2%) transient dilatation of reimplanted ureters was observed and in 8 (1.3%) ureters had to be reimplanted because of secondary dilatation. After 6 months postoperative voiding cystourethrograms showed cessation of reflux in 589 (94.6%) patients, in 33 (5.2%) recurrent reflux was observed, which disappeared in 20 of them in control.

CD010657,0,11221026,0,[Diagnostic approach to newborns with prenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis].,"Prenatal ultrasound examination has radically changed physician's attitude toward hydronephrosis. Fetal hydronephrosis must be searched out and looked at with a wider vision than it was done in the past. A mechanical obstruction must be suspected indeed, but often we have to face a functional dilatation, caused by immaturity, which can clear up in uterus or which will simply require a careful follow-up during the post natal period. Vesicoureteral reflux may count for 10 to 33% of urinary tract dilatations. There are no pathological limit values clearly stated in literature: a pyelectasis can only be the expression of a normal anatomical variability, without features of disease. In creating a diagnostic protocol for the newborn with prenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis, all these possibilities must be accounted for the risk of focusing on mechanical obstruction is to overestimate and over-treat children that will never obtain any benefit from a surgical procedure."

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of VUR and associated renal changes in a group of Arab Kuwaiti children with their first documented febrile UTI and to compare our findings with those reported from other racial groups. One hundred and seventy-four children (38 males and 136 females) fulfilled the study criteria and were divided into three age groups (<1 year, 1-5 years, and >5 years). Patients in each group had both micturating cystourethrography (MCUG) and 99m-Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan after diagnosis. VUR was detected in 39 children (22%). Two-thirds of cases had mild reflux (grade I and II). Females ( n=32) had more reflux than males ( n=7) (24% vs. 18%). Sixty-three patients (36%) had abnormal (DMSA) renal scans (acute pyelonephritis [AP] or renal scars). Of these, 79% were children below 5 years. Abnormal DMSA scans were found in 4 of 38 males (11%) versus 59 of 136 females (43%). Abnormal scans in children with VUR were seen in 1 of 7 males (14%) versus 19 of 32 females (59%). In total, the combination of abnormal scan with VUR occurred in 1 of 38 males (3%) and in 19 of 136 females (14%), whereas abnormal scan without demonstrable VUR was seen in 3 of 38 males (8%) versus 40 of 136 females (29%). Our data showed that the frequency of VUR in Arab Kuwaiti children with febrile UTI is midway between Caucasian and other racial groups. In this study, males had a lower-risk profile than females, the latter having a higher rate of reflux as well as a higher rate of abnormal DMSA scans, irrespective of demonstrable VUR."
CD010657,0,20127383,0,A patient with Bartter syndrome accompanying severe growth hormone deficiency and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.,"Bartter syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive, salt-losing disorder characterized by hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. A 10-year-old boy had severe growth retardation (height standard deviation score -8.15). He had a thin, triangular face, prominent ears and forehead, and big eyes. Megacystis, bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, and residual urine were detected in ultrasonography, but there was no vesicoureteral reflux. Lumbosacral magnetic resonance (MR) showed posterior disc bulging at L4-5. Serum sodium and chloride levels were normal, but mild hypokalemia was overlooked initially. During follow-up, hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis developed, with high urinary chloride and potassium excretion (52 and 43 mEq/L, respectively). The patient, with renal salt loss, was thought to have classic Bartter syndrome due to absence of nephrocalcinosis, presence of persistent hypercalciuria and sensorineural deafness, and presence of relatively mild clinical and laboratory findings, except polyuria initially. The child was treated with indomethacin, spironolactone, and oral potassium in addition to growth hormone (GH). During treatment, he had considerable increase in weight and height compared with the period of GH therapy only. We present this case because, although growth retardation is a major feature of Bartter syndrome, associated GH deficiency is rarely reported in the literature. Diagnosis of Bartter syndrome was made later, as our patient was followed for megacystis and megaureter secondary to the neurogenic bladder and GH deficiency initially; and proteinuria associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis responded to treatment for Bartter syndrome."

Five children had bilateral anomalies. Principal diagnoses associated with the complete duplex system were: 18 ureteroceles (UC) (11 extravesical [EUC] with bladder-neck or urethral extension, 7 intravesical [IUC]), 5 ectopic ureters without UC and 28 lower-polar vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) associated in 6 with upper polar VUR. The initial assessment was based on a voiding cystogram and radionuclide scan. Renal-polar function was severely impaired when major ureteral ectopia or severe primary reflux was present. Primary surgery was performed in 8 patients, demolitive in 4 (3 upper-polar nephrectomies, 1 nephrectomy) and reconstructive in 4 (duplex en-bloc reimplantation); staged management with minimal endoscopic incision was undertaken in 15 UCs (9 EUCs and 6 IUCs). Expectant management was elected in all cases of mild primary, single, or double VUR not associated with UC and was followed by spontaneous reduction in one-half of the cases. Secondary VUR complicated endoscopic incision in 2 of 6 IUCs and 5 of 9 EUCs; a certain degree of functional improvement after decompression could be observed in all IUCs versus only 2 EUCs. Twenty-one patients requested secondary surgery; 17 needed an open intravesical procedure for ureteral reimplantation, combined in 8 with UC excision and bladder-floor reconstruction and in 5 with upper-pole nephrectomy. A nephrectomy was required in 4 cases. All primary or secondary demolitive procedures involved 9 of 11 EUCs extravesical and 2 of 5 ectopic ureters. EUCs and ureteral ectopia were associated with severe renal-polar damage, and function was rarely affected by primary decompressive procedures even in prenatally detected, uninfected cases. Endoscopic incision of EUCs was frequently followed by secondary VUR, which made secondary intravesical operations more complex. For these reasons, primary elective resection of a dysplastic upper pole is preferable in most cases to temporary decompressive measures. Conservative surgery is always indicated in IUC, which may benefit from endoscopic decompression. Isolated VUR involving the lower pole of a completely duplicated system may respond to expectant management in a significant number of cases."

Almost non-existent ipsilateral renal function (26 cases), treated by heminephrectomy and ureterocelic aspiration, and in the remaining a nephrectomy was done for ipsilateral non-existent renal function. 2 cases treated by endoscopic incision presented vesicoureteral reflux, and 4 cases treated by nephrectomy had a low grade reflux. There is no a definite treatment established. The choice should by made based on renal function. Endoscopic incision is a good choice in obstructed cases with good renal function. In those with no function at all, heminephrectomy with aspiration of the ureterocele will be the best treatment if we consider that almost 50 percent of the patients will need a second surgical procedure."

Accordingly, contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography has become a valuable alternative in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. It is possible to achieve significant reduction in radiation exposure replacing the conventional radiologic methods used for reflux diagnosis with contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Through the introduction of harmonic imaging, an ultrasound scanning modality with high spatial and contrast resolution has become available. The modality was initially propagated as one to be applied in difficult-to-scan adults. However, initial experiences in pediatric applications are demonstrating the significant improvement it can bring in the ultrasound image quality, for example, in intestinal ultrasound.

CD010657,0,11045394,0,Clinical course and outcome for children with multicystic dysplastic kidneys.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical course and outcome for children with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) disease and to non-invasively predict which of these patients are at significant risk for developing urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal insufficiency. Patients were divided, on the basis of postnatal physical examination and renal ultrasonography, into simple or complex MCDK. Simple MCDK was defined as unilateral renal dysplasia without additional genitourinary (GU) abnormalities. Complex MCDK included patients with bilateral renal dysplasia or unilateral renal dysplasia with other GU abnormalities. The designation as simple or complex MCDK was independent of reflux, since routine voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was not performed. The charts of all patients with the diagnosis of MCDK disease seen from August 1995 to March 1999 at Yale University School of Medicine were examined to determine: (1) if UTI had occurred and (2) the level of renal function at last follow-up. Thirty-five patients were evaluated: 28 (80%) patients had unilateral MCDK, 7 (20%) were bilateral, and 14 (40%) had associated GU anomalies. Overall, 21 patients had unilateral MCDK without GU abnormalities (simple MCDK), while 14 had complex MCDK. The final outcome for patients with simple MCDK was quite good, with normal renal function and compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney in all patients. Although the patients with simple MCDK did not have routine VCUG or prophylactic antibiotics, the development of UTI was infrequent, damage to the contralateral kidney did not occur, and renal function was well preserved. In contrast, patients with bilateral disease or associated GU anomalies had a higher incidence of UTI and progression to renal failure. Complex MCDK was associated with a worse outcome (50% chronic renal insufficiency or failure)."

Renal pelvis dilation was found in 3.8% of pregnancies followed by our obstetrics department. In nine (17.6%) infants renal anomalies were detected after birth, the remaining cases remained unchanged or resolved over a 1-year postnatal follow-up. In our series dilations of less than 10 mm in utero resolved in the first months after birth while dilations greater than 15 mm were all associated with malformations of the genitourinary tract. The choice of the most appropriate follow-up for dilations between 10 and 15 mm remains an issue because these dilations can herald renal anomalies."

CD010657,0,2406486,0,[Perinatal management of congenital anomalies of the urinary tract detected in utero].,"The routine use of maternal ultrasonography has led to frequent discovery of fetal anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract. Herein we report on 35 cases with congenital urogenital anomalies which were found during the last 5 years by the prenatal ultrasonography and referred to our clinic either for treatment or consultation. 1. Findings of prenatal ultrasonography There were 12 cases of hydronephrosis, 7 of multicystic dysplastic kidney, 4 of megaureter, 3 of posterior urethral valve, 2 of ureterocele, 2 of vesicoureteral reflux and 5 other cases. Fetal anomalies were diagnosed during routine maternal examination, as intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios, or the recurrent risk secondary to genetic risk factor or previous abnormal pregnancies. Prenatal diagnosis was made as early as 20 weeks of gestation in a case of hypoplastic urethra with large bladder diverticula. In about 30% of cases, abnormalities were found before 30 weeks of gestation. Oligohydramnios was evident in 5 cases. Prenatal diagnosis was correct in about 60% of cases. In the remainder the diagnosis was either incomplete or incorrect. Errors in the diagnosis resulted from difficulties in the differentiation of dilated ureter, intestinal dilation or intraperitoneal cystic masses. 2. Management in newborn periods Of the patients, 12 were treated urologically in newborn periods. Although patients with distended bladder and dilatation of upper tracts first underwent therapeutic placement of the urethral catheter, upper tract diversion with nephrostomy or tubeless ureterocutaneostomy was required in 2 because of continued elevation of serum creatinine levels. In 2 neonates nephrectomy was indicated for unilateral multicystic kidney, because the large cystic mass might compress the intestine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010657,0,17493220,0,Frequency of urinary tract infection in pediatric liver transplantation candidates.,"An increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. The tendency of patients in this population to acquire UTI is not completely understood. We aimed at investigating the incidence of UTI in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. Twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. On admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of UTI. Serum biochemistry, complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. Ten of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic UTI. Urine cultures revealed E. coli in five (50%), Klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), Enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and Enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. The etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with UTI were BA in five, PFIC in three, Wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. We found a significantly greater number of UTIs in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). The mean age of the patients with UTI was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without UTI (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). Levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with UTI than in those without UTI. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, AST, GGT, BUN, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and PELD scores. In patients with bacteriuria, renal USG revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. Scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with UTI. VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. In conclusion, symptomatic UTI is common in children with cirrhosis. It occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. In febrile children with chronic liver disease, UTI should be considered in the differential diagnosis."
CD010657,0,2143223,0,Methodologic limitations in the literature on vesicoureteral reflux: a critical review.,"We analyzed studies concerned with four important aspects of vesicoureteral reflux in infancy and childhood: the imaging procedures for the evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux, the treatment of reflux, and the correlation between reflux and later development of hypertension and end-stage kidney disease. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the validity and reliability of the current literature, to draw conclusions, and to recommend future studies for unresolved issues. We reached the following conclusions: (1) Retrograde cystography should be the gold standard for diagnosing vesicoureteral reflux. When ultrasonography and cystography are performed together, all clinically important abnormalities in the urinary system are detected. Intravenous pyelography is needed only when either or both of these studies are abnormal. (2) Other than abolishing reflux, surgery offers no short-term advantages (in terms of preventing breakthrough urinary tract infections, improving renal function, or preventing the development of new scars, hypertension, or end-stage kidney disease) over medical management. (3) The short periods of follow-up and methodologic flaws encountered in the reviewed studies make determination of the incidence of hypertension in children with vesicoureteral reflux impossible. (4) Although indications for an association between vesicoureteral reflux and end-stage kidney disease exist, the strength of this association has not been determined."

CD010657,0,9605611,0,Postnatal follow-up of hydronephrosis detected by prenatal ultrasound: the natural history.,"Babies with hydronephrosis detected antenatally who were born at or referred to our hospital from 1990 to 1995 were followed up with ultrasound (U/S), micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) or nuclear medicine studies after birth. One hundred and three patients were diagnosed antenatally at 17-42 weeks gestation. Twelve cases were excluded from the analysis of the results because of incomplete data. Fifty-one (56%) patients had hydronephrosis without organic obstruction, and 80% of these became normal in 3 years. Fifteen patients (17%) had a normal scan 4 days after birth. This suggests the possibility of antenatal spontaneous regression. Seven (8%) had a ureterocele and 4 (5%) had pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction. Four (5%) had vesicoureteric reflux, and 4 (5%) had primary megaureter. Two (2%) had posterior urethral valves (PUV), 3 (3%) had refluxing primary megaureter, and 1 (1%) had urethral atresia. Fifteen patients (17%) underwent surgical intervention. Six had a nephrectomy, 1 a vesicostomy, 3 an Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty, 3 had the ureterocele unroofed, 1 had a ureteric reimplant, and 1 ablation of valves. In 42 infants with 60 abnormal kidneys, the renal anteroposterior diameter of the pelvis was measured. Retrospectively, 48 kidneys diagnosed as having hydronephrosis, antenatally had a renal pelvis diameter > or = 4 mm before 33 weeks gestation or > or = 7 mm after 33 weeks gestation. One patient with PUJ obstruction lost kidney function, but there is no good marker to detect these patients. Early unroofing of ureteroceles may rescue kidney function. Our follow-up protocol for antenatal hydronephrosis is U/S at 4 days, 1 month and 1 year of age. An MCU is not required unless the ureter is seen on antenatal U/S. If dilatation persists past 1 month, a radionucleotide (MAG3) scan and repeat U/S are performed at 3 months. The methods for assessing obstruction and the indications for surgical intervention in these patients require reexamination."

ET for VUR using newly available bulking agents is a reliable and safe alternative procedure to open ureteral reimplantation for the treatment of VUR in children. We retrospectively reviewed our experience over 10 years of patients with primary VUR who underwent ET and had at least one year of follow-up at our center from 1998 to 2008. We looked at laterality, success rate, need for a second procedure and complication rate. We observed 321 patients with ET for VUR during this period; 115 (35.8%) of them were males and the total intervened ureters were 480. Correction of VUR was defined as either the resolution of reflux or a downgrading to grade 1 revealed with a follow-up voiding cystourethrogram and no ipsilateral renal or ureteric dilatation detected on renal ultrasound. At two to three months of follow-up, VUR was corrected in 393/480 (81.8%) refluxing ureters after a single endoscopic injection. With a second, repeated injection in the failed cases, VUR was corrected in a total of 418 (87.1%) refluxing ureters. Only three patients had post-operative complications (<1%). We conclude that our study suggests that the majority of patients will be cured after undergoing, as out-patients, this endoscopic procedure. We believe that the widely reported safety of bulking agents and the short learning curve will make ET the standard treatment for VUR once surgical correction is warranted."

CD010657,0,1328692,0,Use of 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid to study patterns of renal damage associated with prenatally detected vesicoureteral reflux.,"Static isotope imaging with 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid was performed at a mean age of 34 days in 32 children (50 kidneys) whose vesicoureteral reflux had been identified as a result of prenatal ultrasound scanning. Three patterns of isotope uptake were observed: 1) noninfected primary vesicoureteral reflux (15 children, 24 kidneys), 2) noninfected secondary (obstructed) vesicoureteral reflux (9 patients, 11 kidneys) and 3) infected primary reflux (8 infants, 15 kidneys). In 20 pattern 1 kidneys (83%) renal morphology and differential isotope were normal. In the 4 kidneys (17%) that showed evidence of impaired function this took the form of global parenchymal loss, that is small kidneys rather than focal scarring. In pattern 2 the combination of fetal vesicoureteral reflux and obstruction was a potent cause of renal damage with total or near total loss of function in 7 of 9 refluxing units associated with posterior urethral valves and in 2 kidneys with secondary ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Appearances of focal scarring were confined in pattern 3 and were found in 4 kidneys (27%). This overall incidence of detectable renal damage was lower than expected. Even when infection occurs, prenatal diagnosis may lessen the risk of scarring by enabling treatment to be instituted promptly. The findings suggest that uncomplicated primary vesicoureteral reflux is a relatively benign insult to the fetal kidney and that reflux nephropathy found in children presenting clinically is the result of infected vesicoureteral reflux in postnatal life. Any comparison of published studies will prove difficult until there is a more standardized approach to imaging technique and patient selection."

On initial examination, all patients showed severe bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter on sonographic findings, dilatation of the prostate urethra and trabeculation of the bladder wall in the voiding cystourethrogram; only one patient showed vesicoureteral reflux. Type I urethral valves were present in all patients. Retrograde transurethral ablation of the valves was performed in four patients with good preoperative renal function. The postoperative courses were smooth except for vesicoureteral reflux in one patient and systemic fungus infection in another. Reimplantation of the ureter was done for the vesicoureteral reflux, and the fungus infection was treated by amphotericin B. Cutaneous vesicostomy was performed for a newborn since the urethral orifice was small. He presented with poor renal function and ascites. Delayed antegrade ablation of the valves per vesicostomy and closure of the vesicostomy were done three months later after restoration of the renal function.

Even more curious is the fact that in the same child, bilateral, symmetrical and infected reflux with distension of the urinary tract may be accompanied by severe involvement of one kidney whilst the contralateral kidney is not only free of any problem but sometimes even in a state of compensatory hypertrophy. Eight examples (out of a series of 310 cases of reflux in the child) are reported, renal function being assessed by quantitative renal scintigraphy.

Genital anomalies associated with unilateral renal agenesis are more common in females. We report the case of a 13 months girl allowed for assessment of recurrent urinary tract infection; abdominal examination did not objectified palpable mass, the external genitalia were without abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a left renal space is empty with a retrovesical cyst. Cystography was requested that objectified a large pelvic cystic mass retrovesical communicating with the bladder, there was also a left vesicoureteral reflux. Uro- MRI showed a cystic formation retrovesical communicating with the bladder, the right pelvic kidney; uterus is normal size for age. DMSA scintigraphy confirmed the absence of the left kidney with the right kidney that ensures 100% of total renal function. To surgical exploration we found a hernia of the bladder through the left broad ligament, the uterus was dislocated on the right side; left ovary was hypoplasic; the ipsilateral ureter was blind with renal agenesis, we performed by reduction of the bladder then closing the hernial orifice, dissection of the ureter with its ligation and section at the vesical stoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. Evolution is favorable.

In patients aged between 1 month and 24 months with a first febrile UTI (FUTI; n = 205) the leading pathogen was Escherichia coli (E. coli) (83.4%). In comparison with patients with FUTI, those with RUTI (n = 24) had more Enterococcus and Enterobacter infections and higher resistance rates of E. coli against trimethoprim (TMP), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) or ampicillin (AMP). Boys with ultrasound-detected renal abnormalities (n = 71) showed 14.2% Pseudomonas and 59.1% E. coli infections versus girls (n = 48) (2.1% Pseudomonas and 93.7% E. coli).

Treatment with TMP, SXT and AMP alone appeared to be insufficient in many cases because of high resistance rates of E. coli and other uropathogens."
CD010657,0,7925538,0,Color flow Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux.,"We describe an alternative technique using color flow Doppler sonography (CFDS) for detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Twenty-one children, ages 2-16 years, were investigated for VUR using voiding cystourethrography (VCU) and CFDS. Forty-two ureterovesical junctions were studied and a total of 27 were found to be refluxing at VCU. Five of these 21 patients were operated for VUR and they were also reevaluated 3 and 6 months after the operation. With good diuresis ureteric jets could easily be detected with CFDS and if there was a reflux of urine into the ureter this could also be displayed. Afterwards, the patient was asked to urinate and if reflux into the ureter was detected, particular attention was paid to the detection of ureteral and pelvicalyceal dilatation by conventional gray-scale sonography. Taking VCU as the gold standard, CFDS revealed reflux in all cases except 1. There were 3 patients who had only one-sided reflux at VCU and bilateral reflux at CFDS examination (false-positive: 20%). Correlation of CFDS and VCU was 90, 100 and 75% in low grade, grade III and grade IV reflux, respectively. The results of CFDS correlated well with the results of VCU during the follow-up of 5 patients who had antireflux operations. As a conclusion, CFDS could be used as an adjunct to standard ultrasonography for detection of VUR."

CD010657,0,16356021,0,Controversies in the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in children.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common childhood bacterial infections, after upper respiratory tract and middle ear infections. The current goal of management is to prevent detrimental effects of UTI by early detection and treatment. Recommendations for the imaging of children depend upon age at presentation and sex. All children aged <5 years who have had a febrile UTI require a radiologic evaluation to identify any underlying genitourinary pathology. Older children can undergo a more tailored work-up depending on whether there is a febrile UTI or cystitis-type symptoms. Dysfunctional voiding and urge syndrome significantly increase the risk of developing UTIs in children. Vesicoureteral reflux can increase the risk of pyelonephritis and renal scarring in children with UTIs. For the most part, pyelonephritis can be diagnosed on clinical grounds in the majority of patients and a subsequent (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan can be reserved to identify post-nephritic renal scarring. When renal scarring is identified, the child and parents need to be educated regarding the possibility of hypertension, proteinuria, progressive nephropathy, and the risk of complications in future pregnancies. Treatment of UTI is started in the unwell child before the culture results are available and subsequently changed to culture-specific antimicrobial therapy. A short course of treatment is required for acute uncomplicated UTIs. A child with acute pyelonephritis requires 10-14 days of antibacterial treatment. The oral route in young children often causes vomiting, which implies therapeutic delay, a well known risk factor for scarring."

They were divided into two groups. Group A included 34 babies (25M/9F) with a prenatal diagnosis of pelvic dilatation. Mean age at presentation was 12 days and no urinary tract infection (UTI) occurred before our first examination. VUR was unilateral in 21 (62%) patients and bilateral in 13 (38%). It was mild (grades I-III) in 12 (25%) refluxing renal units (RRU) and severe (grades IV-V) in 35 (75%). Renal damage (RD) was present, at diagnosis, in 40 (85%) RRU. There was a greater prevalence of abnormal kidneys in male units (88%) than in female units (75%). Group B included 59 infants (22M/37F) less than 1 year old with UTI. The mean age at first examination was 7.6 months. VUR was unilateral in 32 (54%) infants and bilateral in 27 (46%), mild in 60 (70%) RRU and severe in 26 (30%). At diagnosis, 54 (63%) RRU presented RD, which was more common in females (66%) than in males (44%). Our study confirms that primary VUR associated with prenatal hydronephrosis usually affects males and is severe. VUR diagnosed after UTI, instead, is more common in females and is frequently mild. Although in the first type of reflux RD is often present at diagnosis, then probably congenital, it may always progress after UTI; hence the importance of early diagnosis and careful follow-up in each infant with primary VUR."

The urine IL-6 and IL-8/creatinine quotients were also related to the urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and albumin/creatinine quotients. Presence of DMSA uptake defects, reflecting local inflammation, in children in the acute phase of pyelonephritis, were associated with elevated urine IL-6/creatinine quotients (median 27 pg/mumol); in children without DMSA changes there was no increase in quotients (median non-detectable) (P < 0.05). Persistent DMSA changes at the 1-year follow-up, probably reflecting renal scarring, were only seen in children with increased urine IL-6/creatinine quotients in the acute phase (P < 0.01). No correlation was found between urine IL-8 and DMSA uptake defects. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) at 6-8 weeks did not correlate with the urine cytokine levels in the acute phase. The urine excretion of NAG and albumin, reflecting renal dysfunction, was associated with values of both urine IL-6 and IL-8/creatinine quotients, but not with DMSA defects or VUR. Thus, the initial urine IL-6/creatinine quotients might be used as an indicator of risk for persistent renal damage in acute pyelonephritis."

All patients presented with urinary tract infections and voiding disfunction symptoms. 5 children had vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystography and 10 patients had established scars on DMSA scan at initial presentation. Urodynamic study showed constriction of the urinary sphincter during voiding and increase of post-voiding residual urine volume in all children, with bladder instability 20 (80%). Treatment consisted of voiding reeducation, anticholinergics, antibiotic prophylaxis and muscle relaxants. The mean of follow-up was 22 months. Clinical remission occurred prior to urodynamic remission in all girls. Clinical recurrence was observed in 2 girls after cessation of treatment prior to normalization of urodynamic pattern. Non-coordinated voiding should be diagnosed and treated at pediatric age to avoid its possible progression to renal failure in other period of life."

Cystourethrography after nephrostomy showed bilateral vesicoureteral reflex (VUR). On the left side, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) stenosis was found. Left fistelography showed hydronephrosis, but the ureter was not visualized. A mechanism like a valve at the left UPJ was suggested; the bladder urine was able to ascend to the pelvis but not to be drained from the pelvis. The left renal function was not expected to recover from the findings of renal scintigram and CT. Left nephroureterectomy and right anti-VUR operation were performed. The extirpated renal and ureteral specimens revealed a nonpapillary tumorous structure like a valve at the left UPJ. The histological examination of the valve-like structure revealed the presence of two muscle layers without an adventitia folded at the UPJ."

CD010657,0,19603195,0,ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism and renal scarring in children with urinary tract infections.,"Urinary tract infection is a common bacterial disease that presents during childhood and may lead to renal scarring. Several studies have shown a strong association between the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) deletion polymorphism and renal scarring in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible correlation between the ACE deletion polymorphism and renal scarring in 186 children with urinary tract infection (UTI), of whom 90 were renal scar positive and 96 were renal scar negative. The control group consisted of 129 children with no UTI. Renal scars were diagnosed by means of (99m)Tc-dimercapto-succinic acid scans, and ACE genotypes were determined as II, ID, and DD by PCR analyses. The ACE genotype distribution was 10% II, 67% ID, and 23% DD in the renal scar-positive group, 18% IotaIota, 42% ID, and 40% DD in the renal scar-negative group, and 22% II, 47% ID, and 31% DD in the control group. No correlation was found between the DD genotype and renal scar formation in children with UTI. The same results were obtained following strafication of the patients by VUR and age of the first urinary tract infection. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the DD genotype is not an independent risk factor for renal scarring in children with UTI."
CD010657,0,1785021,0,Vesicoureteral reflux in adults studied by computerized radionuclide cystography.,"Direct radionuclide cystography in a computerized method as described by Willi and Treves was used in adults with recurrent pyelitis but without evidence of obstruction. Reflux was observed in 15 out of 38 patients. In patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction or megaureters, reflux began early during the bladder filling and attained higher volumes than in those with uncomplicated pyelitis, who had minor reflux appearing mainly during voiding. Bladder capacity and detrusor compliance were lower in patients with reflux than in those without reflux. The low radiation exposure in radionuclide cystography permits observation of the urodynamic course of urinary reflux and correlation to the intravesical volume and pressure. The method is sensitive, and minor refluxed volumes can be detected. Radionuclide cystography can therefore be recommended for checking of surgical results and for follow-up of patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction."

Urography could be necessary in some cases. For bilateral uropathy evaluation of renal function with blood tests is required. Early surgery is needed in case of severe obstructive uropathy; if obstruction is mild the patients can be followed with instrumental investigation.

Unilateral reflux was more frequently noted in children with an unstable bladder. In cases of a stable bladder, bilateral reflux occurred more frequently.

A 32-year-old woman presented at gestational week 15 for evaluation of fetal bladder enlargement. Prenatal ultrasonography revealed megacystis and posterior urethral dilatation. The longitudinal diameter of the bladder was 25 mm. Megacystis spontaneously resolved at gestational week 16. No association with urinary ascites was observed, and amniotic fluid volume remained normal throughout gestation. A boy was delivered vaginally at week 37. Apgar scores were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. The neonate voided smoothly. Ultrasonography revealed a thickened bladder wall and normal kidneys and upper urinary tracts. Voiding cystourethrography showed dilatation of the posterior urethra but confirmed normal bladder capacity with smooth voiding and no vesicoureteral reflux. On day 57, remnant valves were incised. Postoperatively, filling cystometry showed a compliant bladder with no involuntary phasic contraction. At 7 months follow-up, the infant was asymptomatic, and ultrasonography showed some improvement of bladder wall thickness.

We utilized color doppler US (CD-Jet) of uretero-vesical jets (UVJ) to visualize the post-obstructive ureteral flow in childhood HN. A total of 177 standardized CD-Jet were performed in 132 children aged 1 day to 14.9 years. Sixty-nine investigations in 43 patients with unilateral HN were compared with a standardized technetium 99m-mercaptotriacetylglycine nephrogram; in 10 infants both procedures were performed consecutively on the same day. UVJ were visible in 96% of all investigations. Ureteral obstruction resulted in absence of UVJ in 85% of examinations; in the remaining 15% the jet frequency was less than 10% observed in the contralateral control. Results are highly significant in both uretero-pelvic (P < 0.00007) and uretero-vesical lesions (P < 0.00005, Wilcoxon test) and are reproducible in sequential investigations. In nonobstructive distal HN the jet frequency averaged 70% of the unaffected side (P < 0.05). In proximal lesions it is equal. Jet evaluation in reflux nephropathy did not differ from controls. Compared with scintigraphy, CD-US identifies obstruction with a specificity of 94.2% and sensitivity of 94.8%. CD-US of UVJ therefore may serve as a reliable screening parameter in unilateral childhood HN."

Ultrasonographic definitions are presented, along with guidelines for the management of urinary tract dilatations. Isolated pyelectasis without caliceal involvement rarely constitutes a pathological situation and does not require any particular diagnostic or therapeutic measures. Obstructive dilatation is characterized by an obstacle to normal urinary flow situated at any level in the urinary tract, with consequent stagnation of urine and dilatation upstream of the obstruction. If the obstruction is not correctly treated it can cause a progressive deterioration of renal function. The presence of ureterectasia plays a crucial role in the diagnostic algorithm and a micturitional cystourethrography is necessary to look for a vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). The significance of urinary tract dilatation is discussed in detail."

CD010657,0,15221260,0,Surgical management of vesicoureteral reflux in pediatric patients.,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) represents one of the most significant risk factors for acute pyelonephritis in children. The current indications for the surgical correction of VUR depend on the presence or absence of renal scars. If no scars are present, primary ureteral reimplantation is only indicated in high-grade bilateral VUR, whereas in the presence of renal scars surgical correction is indicated in low/high grade reflux at a young age. Since there are numerous techniques for antireflux surgery available, it is the purpose of this article to critically review these techniques with their specific advantages, typical complications and postoperative management. In general, all surgical technique have a high success rate of 92-98%. The extravesical Lich-Gregoir technique is primarily indicated in unilateral VUR. Children with a high-grade VUR, who are under the age of 3 years and boys are prone to the development of postoperative urinary retention and might be considered for intravesical surgical techniques. The Politano-Leadbetter technique is very helpful in correcting bilateral VUR of any grade in one session to create a neo-ostium in an anatomically correct position which is easily accessible for endourological manipulations. The Psoas hitch ureteroneocystotomy is an excellent technique to correct VUR associated with megaureter, or with duplicated ureters, and VUR failures. Endoscopic subureteral injections are primarily reserved for low grade VUR with a one session success rate of >90%. Endoscopic subureteral injections appear to be an alternative to long-term antibiotics in grade I-III VUR. Laparoscopic antireflux surgery has not gained widespread use due to the very long operating times. Contralateral VUR will occur in about 20% of children undergoing unilateral antireflux surgery; risk factors are severe VUR and VUR into a duplicated system. Postoperative follow-up nowadays consists of urinalysis and ultrasonography; voiding cystourethrography is only indicated in case of febrile urinary tract infection. Despite the excellent success rates following antireflux surgery one has to keep in mind that surgery only corrects the anatomical abnormality. The long-term outcome with regard to renal function, posttherapeutic febrile urinary tract infections and arterial hypertension does not differ significantly from the medication group except for those patients with a demonstrated a genetic background. Therefore, the indication for surgery and the surgical technique applied have to be discussed thoroughly and must be associated with a minimal complication rate."

The other 50% comprises ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesico-ureteral reflux and primary megaureters. Postnatal radiological evaluation (renal ultrasonography and VCUG) is performed in every infant with a significantly dilated renal pelvis (> 8 mm between 20 and 30 weeks or > 10 mm after 30 weeks in utero). Renal nuclear scan should be done in every child with significant/worsening post-natal hydronephrosis. Antibioprophylaxis will be started from birth to prevent urinary tract infection. Medical or surgical approach will be chosen in the light of the uroradiological exam results and the clinical progress."

Most previously described laparoscopic techniques have used an extravesical approach. A ""vesicoscopic"" technique is analogous to standard open cross-trigonal repair in principle, except that 3 ports with insufflation of the bladder are used to perform the ureteral reimplantation."
CD010657,0,18661415,0,Microalbuminuria in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common congenital anomaly of the urinary tract that may be inherited. Reflux of infected urine may cause scarring in susceptible kidneys with the potential to compromise renal function. The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible influence of different grades of VUR on glomerular damage using microalbuminuria as a parameter. Children with VUR detected by voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) were investigated. According to the grade of VUR, patients were separated into three groups. The first group included 12 children with VUR grade I-II. The second group consisted of 12 children with grade III of VUR. Patients with VUR grade IV-V (n = 11) were members of the third group. The control group consisted of 17 healthy children. Microalbuminuria was examined in samples of morning urine specimens using a microalbumin/creatinine reagent kit. Serum urea, creatinine levels and creatinine clearance (CCR) were measured as markers of renal function. The mean value of microalbumin excretion in the third group showed a statistically significant increase (p < 0.001) compared to all other groups. CCR in the third group was statistically significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in comparison to the group of healthy children. There were no statistically significant changes of microalbumin excretion and CCR in the first and second group compared to control values. We discussed the presence of microalbuminuria and decrease of CCR in children with high grade of VUR as a possible consequence of retrograde urine flow (intrarenal reflux), glomerulosclerosis, and consecutive hyperfiltration."
CD010657,0,20951362,0,Psychogenic urinary retention in children: a case report.,"Psychogenic urinary retention occurs relatively infrequently in children and is less common than in adults. The influence of psychogenic factors on voiding generally results in an irritative syndrome, but rarely in urinary retention. A definitive diagnosis is established by excluding other pathological conditions. Evaluation includes urine culture, renal echography, spine magnetic resonance imaging, voiding cysto-urethrography, intravenous pyelography, and uroflowmetry. Here, we report on a 6-year-old girl with a 1-month history of voiding difficulty. Urology studies, including urine culture, revealed Escherichia coli, which was not present in preadmission urine cultures. Renal ultrasound and radiological images showed no gross abnormalities or vesicoureteral reflux, but uroflowmetry showed a low flow rate with residual urine. The results of imaging studies and pediatric psychiatric consultation led to a diagnosis of psychogenic urinary retention combined with urinary tract infection. Urinary rehabilitation included intermittent catheterization, bladder training, and supportive psychotherapy, after which the patient recovered and was discharged."
CD010657,0,2044317,0,Low-grade vesicoureteral reflux. Variability in grade on sequential radiographic and nuclear cystograms.,"Paired voiding cystourethrogram (VCU) and nuclear cystogram (NC) studies in 68 children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) were analyzed to determine the variability of VUR on sequential studies. Sequential paired examinations included 82 studies where a VCU was followed by a repeat VCU study and 128 studies where a VCU was followed by a NC study. Grade I VUR on the initial VCU was difficult to duplicate on repeat cystography, regardless of the follow-up modality. When the initial VCU showed no VUR, 20% of follow-up studies demonstrated VUR. Follow-up VCU and NC studies showed similar results in detecting increases and decreases in the grade of VUR. Low-grade VUR may be intermittent, and clinical therapeutic decisions should take this variability into account."

CD010657,0,9556646,0,Evaluation and treatment of urinary tract infections in children.,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections encountered by primary care physicians. Although UTIs do not occur with as great a frequency in children as in adults, they can be a source of significant morbidity in children. For reasons that are not yet completely understood, a minority of UTIs in children progress to renal scarring, hypertension and renal insufficiency. Clinical presentation of UTI in children may be nonspecific, and the appropriateness of certain diagnostic tests remains controversial. The diagnostic work-up should be tailored to uncover functional and structural abnormalities such as dysfunctional voiding, vesicoureteral reflux and obstructive uropathy. A more aggressive work-up, including renal cortical scintigraphy, ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography, is recommended for patients at greater risk for pyelonephritis and renal scarring, including infants less than one year of age and all children who have systemic signs of infection concomitant with a UTI. Antibiotic prophylaxis is used in patients with reflux or recurrent UTI who are at greater risk for subsequent infections and complications."

CD010657,0,11519895,0,Angiotensin converting enzyme gene polymorphism in primary vesicoureteral reflux.,"We studied the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene in 78 patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and examined renal function by dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) renoscintigraphy and diethylenetriamine-penta-acetic acid (DTPA) renogram in each genotype. Patients were classified into three genotypes according to the ACE gene I/D polymorphisms: 32 in II genotype, 36 in ID, and 10 in DD. The incidence of presumably congenital unilateral small kidneys was high in DD patients (70%). Glomerular filtration rate obtained from DTPA renogram was 120.7+/-35.7 ml/min (expressed as mean+/-SD) in II genotype, 111.7+/-33.3 in ID, and 88.0+/-18.0 in DD. The total quantitative DMSA tracer uptake of both kidneys was also low in patients with the D allele. This study shows that the D allele of ACE gene is closely related to small congenital kidneys with refluxing ureters in patients with primary VUR, and in accordance with previous reports, this allele is also related to the progression of reflux nephropathy."

CD010657,0,9509929,0,Augmented enterocystoplasty for neurogenic bladder associated with renal transplantation: appearance on Tc-99m MAG3 renal transplant scan.,"Enterocystoplasty (bladder augmentation) is a method of increasing bladder capacity in patients with small or neurogenic bladders in order to prevent vesicoureteral reflux. In patients with poorly compliant bladders, enterocystoplasty, which consists of a segment of detubularized small bowel or a portion of the stomach attached to the bladder, often helps to reduce the intravesicular pressures, thus reducing the likelihood of infection. It is also useful in treating bladder dysfunction in children with end-stage renal disease who require renal transplantation. Radiographic evaluation of patients with a renal transplant and augmented bladder often can be confusing, and may suggest a urine leak or hematoma. We report a patient with a renal transplant, bladder augmentation, and rising serum creatinine who underwent renal scintigraphy and ultrasonography."
CD010657,0,10971153,0,Association of angiotensin I converting enzyme gene polymorphism with reflux nephropathy in children.,"Deletion polymorphism of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been studied as a risk factor in various cardiovascular diseases and chronic nephropathies. Perturbation of local and systemic renin-angiotensin systems is one of the possible mechanisms of the progression of reflux nephropathy. In this study, the implication of ACE gene polymorphism in renal scarring and deterioration of renal function was analyzed in 66 children with vesicoureteral reflux. The genotype for the polymorphism was determined by PCR, and renal scar was identified by (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scan. The allelic frequency of the deletion polymorphism showed no significant difference either between patients with normal renal function and those with decreased renal function or between patients with renal scar and those without. We conclude that deletion polymorphism of ACE gene, as an independent variable, is not associated with reflux nephropathy in children with vesicoureteral reflux."

There were 107 infection-prone subjects with a median age of 7.1 years at the first and 21.7 years at the last urography. Of 51 females who ultimately had lesions, 38 had established scars at the first urography. In 18 subjects, new scars were found in previously undamaged kidneys, 5 already with unilateral scarring. There had been a normal urography after the 5th birthday in 8 of those with later scarring. Worsening of scarring was seen in 10 of the 38 subjects with established scars. The renal damage was in most cases slight or moderate. By stepwise logistic regression analysis, grade of reflux and number of pyelonephritic attacks correlated with scarring, and number of pyelonephritic attacks with new scars and worsening of the lesions. In summary, of the females who ultimately had renal lesions, one-third developed new scars. In most of those with established scars at the first urography, the focal character of lesions suggests that most were also acquired. Since reflux and number of pyelonephritic attacks were identified as risk factors, prevention of renal deterioration should be possible."

Twenty one children (44.7%) suffered from secondary, and 17 (55.3%) from primary enuresis. High incidence of enuresis (31.6%) or voiding dysfunction, renal lithiasis, constipation of other kidney disease (42%) were disclosed among family members of children with enuresis. Urodynamic studies revealed bladder dysfunction in 84.0% of children with enuresis mostly in the form of dyssingeric (45.5%) or unstable/hyperactive bladder (45.5%). In 9% of patients bladder dysfunction as in the form of inadequate bladder with small and poor detrusor contractions often associated with large residue.

Dilatation of the upper urinary tract was visualized in 91 of 732 ureters (12.43%). Upper urotract dilatation may be either a sign of the obstruction of ureterovesical junction caused by Teflon or recurrence of vesicoureteral reflux. Echosonographically, 4 types of dilatation were disclosed, each having, a particular diagnostic or therapeutic approach. Acute dilatations associated with pain (2 patients-0.4%) were subjected to emergency surgery (ureterocystoneostomy). Chronic dilatation, which did not abate even after 4 weeks (6 ureters-0.81%) was identically treated. A temporary dilatation usually withdrew spontaneously after 1-2 weeks (66 ureters-9.01%).

Several investigators have claimed that because acute-phase Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal-scan results are abnormal in the presence of dilating vesicoureteral reflux, a normal DMSA-scan result makes voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) unnecessary in the primary examination of infants with UTI. To evaluate the accuracy of acute-phase DMSA scanning in identifying dilating (grades III through V) vesicoureteral reflux documented by VCUG in children with a first febrile UTI, we performed a meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests as reported from relevant studies identified through the PubMed and Scopus databases. Patient-based and renal unit-based analyses were performed. Overall, 13 cohort studies were identified. Nine studies involved patients younger than 2 years, 3 involved children aged 16 years or younger, and 1 involved exclusively neonates. Girls constituted 22% to 85% of the involved children. Pooled (95% confidence intervals) sensitivity and specificity rates of DMSA scanning were 79% and 53%, respectively, for the patient-based analysis (8 studies) and 60% and 65% for the renal unit-based analysis (5 studies). The respective areas under the hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were 0.71 and 0.67.

To document the postoperative outcome, a voiding cystourethrography is routinely performed to exclude persisting reflux. Our aim was to evaluate the benefit of voiding cystoureterography (VCUG) in our patients with respect to radiation, discomfort to the child and costs. The medical records of all patients who underwent an ureterocystoneostomy at the Department of Paediatric Surgery in St. Gallen, Switzerland, between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2000 were reviewed in terms of the pre- and postoperative clinical course, type of surgical procedure and radiographic examinations performed. During this period, 126 renal units were operated in 81 patients. The surgical technique employed was Cohen's procedure in 121 (96 %) renal units and a Leadbetter-Politano procedure in 5 (4 %) renal units. Mean postoperative follow-up was 42 months (6 - 84). All patients had an ultrasonographic follow-up. 77 (95 %) patients underwent a VCUG with normal results one year postoperatively. VUR was found in 4 patients, 3 of them were asymptomatic one year postoperatively, one had a complication of a fistula with reflux and required reoperation 2 months after operation. The VCUG was performed earlier because of clinical und ultrasonographic findings. None of the routinely performed VCUGs led to a change of procedure.

Most cases are sporadic, but familial instances have also been observed in first-degree relatives. We report on a mother and two of her children who have the oculoauriculovertebral ""spectrum."" The mother had only auricular anomalies for which she had plastic and reconstructive surgery. Her first child, a girl, had a bilateral cleft lip and palate, a coloboma of upper eyelid, facial asymmetry, and posteriorly angulated ears. This child also had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux. During the second pregnancy fetal ultrasonographic examination performed at 18th week of gestation showed a cleft lip and palate. At the thirty-first week of gestation, club feet, hypoplasia of the left ear, hypoplasia of the left maxillary and mandibular arches, and left microphthalmia were evident. Examination of this fetus confirmed ultrasonographic findings and demonstrated vertebral anomalies. This familial observation confirmed variable expressivity of the oculoauriculovertebral anomaly with isolated microtia (the mother), major malformations (the fetus), and less serious anomalies (the first child) and showed that this condition may be inherited as an autosomal or X-linked dominant condition."

The study included only those patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), in whom the reflux had disappeared and the Teflon deposits were visible 6 weeks following STING treatment. Cessation of VUR was proven by voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG) in 99 patients (143 ureters). Average follow-up time was 9 (4-12) years. Patients were divided into two groups: group I, deposits visible with ultrasound [deposit (+)], and group II, no visible deposits at the end of the follow-up period [deposit (-)]. Reflux recurrence, the occurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and pyelonephritis were investigated, and technetium scintigraphy scans were examined. The deposit (+) group included 43 patients (65 ureters), and the deposit (-) group contained 56 patients (78 ureters). In the deposit (+) group there were no recurrences of VUR; however, 17 recurrences were found in the deposit (-) group (P < 0.05). Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy scans and occurrence of UTI showed significant difference between the groups (P < 0.05). A close relationship was found between the disappearance of the Teflon deposit and the recurrence of VUR. Disappearance of the Teflon deposit and repeated bacteriuria is a warning sign of the recurrence of VUR; therefore, VCUG might be warranted for these patients."

Echo-enhanced VUS was performed in 75 children, 57 girls and 18 boys, aged 3 years to 12 years, following the accepted indications for this procedure. During the same procedure the measurement of UJDW was also performed and was considered to be successful (in 70 children) when at least ten UJDWs were recorded per ureteric unit. Depending on the shape of the UJDWs, the sequences were classified into three groups: monophasic, suggestive of VUR; complex, not suggestive of VUR; and mixed sequence, suggestive of VUR when a certain ratio between monophasic and complex UJDWs was achieved. When all three sequences were taken into account, the overall sensitivity and specificity of this method in detecting VUR were 88.5% and 82.3%, respectively. These values seem high enough for this method to be considered as a good alternative to invasive micturating cystographies in screening children for VUR."

The most frequent finding was vesicoureteral reflux, occurring in 62.1% of the pathologic cases. The findings at ultrasonography correlated well with those of intravenous pyelography in 73 of the 81 studies (90.1%), but they failed to demonstrate double collecting systems and several of the minor changes. However, ultrasonography in combination with cystourethrography identified all patients who had abnormal urinary systems, except for two children with negligible findings. Moreover, ultrasonography and cystourethrography together identified all 11 patients, nine of them inpatients, in whom surgical treatment was indicated. It is concluded that ultrasonography can successfully replace intravenous pyelography as a screening imaging procedure for the urinary system, but because of the superiority of intravenous pyelography in the detection of some types of lesions, intravenous pyelography will be required whenever ultrasonography or cystourethrography results are abnormal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010657,0,25030771,0,The value of direct radionuclide cystography in the detection of vesicoureteral reflux in children with normal voiding cystourethrography.,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is one of the most important risk factors for urinary tract infection (UTI). Diagnosis and treatment of VUR is important to prevent irreversible complications, such as renal scarring and chronic renal failure. This study was conducted to assess the value of direct radionuclide cystography (DRNC) in the detection of VUR in children with UTI and a normal voiding cystourethrography (VCUG)."

All newborns carried out urinalysis and urine culture and performed a renal sonogram to reconfirm the diagnosis at 1 month of age. After 3 month of life the pelvic dilatation was confirmed in 61 patients while 5 showed a complete disappearance, 61 patients underwent micturitional cystography that evidenced 30 renal units (RU) with moderate to severe vesicoureteral reflux. In the patients without reflux, a scintigraphy was carried out with DTPA or MAG 3 and/or IVP and evidenced a functional junctional pathology in 32 RU and an organic junctional pathology in 24 RU, a primary megaureter with pre-vesical stenosis in 6 RU and a pyelo-ureteral complete double system in 4 RU. The patients with organic stenosis or those patients with parenchymal damage due to the vesicoureteral reflux underwent surgical intervention during the 1st year of life while all the remaining patients are continuously monitored to date with biohumoral exams and echography. With these results we can safely confirm the important role of the sonogram in the initial diagnosis of pyelectasia and to its eventual modifications in order to benefit the patients with a nephro-urological pathology and direct them toward a correct follow up."

This study was undertaken to corroborate SPECT dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphic findings with specific histopathology in acute pyelonephritis. Unilateral vesicoureteral reflux was produced in 19 Yorkshire piglets 3 to 4 weeks old. The bladders of 12 animals were inoculated with Escherichia coli 2 weeks later, after baseline SPECT DMSA scans had been obtained. The animals were then re-imaged at 3 (4), 7 (4) or 14 (4) days after infection and sacrificed for histological evaluation. Seven purposefully uninfected piglets with unilateral reflux served as controls and were followed for up to 6 weeks before imaging and sacrifice. SPECT proved to be 97% sensitive and 93% specific in providing the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The SPECT findings were manifest by a spectrum of abnormal findings (mottling, striations, inner cortical scalloping and focal cortical defects), which correlated precisely with the extent and severity of cortical involvement in the acute pyelonephritic process. We propose a new classification scheme for SPECT DMSA renal scintigraphic imaging, and believe that this modality is exquisitely sensitive in providing the diagnosis as well as in evaluating the extent of renal parenchymal involvement when acute pyelonephritis is induced in the animal model."

CD010657,0,1127814,0,Direct and indirect radionuclide cystography.,"Direct radionuclide cystography, using short half-life radiopharmaceuticals, is considered to be more reliable for detecting vesicoureteral reflux than conventional roentgenographic techniques. In addition to the detection of vesicoureteral reflux, other parameters determined include the bladder volume when reflux occurs, calculation of volume of fluid that has refluxed, accurate calculation of residual urine volume, estimation of reflux drainage time, and the visualization and diagnosis of gross anatomic abnormalities. Currently, a major disadvantage is poor resolution, prohibiting analysis of small bladder defects and urethral abnormalities. The major advantage of nuclear cystography is the small radiation dose delivered with its use. It is estimated that at least 100 radionuclide studies can be performed for the same radiation expense as a single roentgenographic study."

The VUS was performed in 350 patients (244 males, 106 females) less than 4 years of age, and complemented with perineal US. Ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder was obtained before and during bladder filling and post-voiding. The urethra and the neck of the bladder were evaluated sagittally by transperineal ultrasound (5-7.5 MHz) before, during, and after voiding. Only cases of posterior urethral valves diagnosed at VUS were followed by voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), which was performed on a different day. A satisfactory evaluation of the urethra was obtained in 332 cases (94.86%): (a). normal urethra ( n=328); and (b). posterior urethral valves ( n=4). In the latter 4 cases there was concordance between results at VUS and VCUG. Eighteen cases (5.14%) were excluded from the study because the quality of the examination was suboptimal. Transperineal US offers an initial imaging modality for studying urethral pathology and thus may complement VUS."

CD010657,0,9307157,1,Transient pyelonephritic changes on 99mTechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan for at least five months after infection.,"A prospective study was performed on 185 children with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), 130F and 55M, having a median age of 0.9 y (range 0.1-9.8) at the time of UTI. The aim of the study was to find out how the 99mTechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan should be used to investigate UTI, and to follow the development of renal changes during pyelonephritis into subsequent permanent renal damage. All children were investigated with a DMSA scan within 5 days after admission and after 3.9-53.3 (median 9.2) weeks, and 159 were studied again after approximately 2 y (range 1.5-3.9 y). They all underwent micturition cystourethrography at the time of the second study. At the time of infection, the DMSA scan was abnormal in 85% of the children, in 58% at the first follow-up and in 36% at the second follow-up. An abnormal DMSA scan performed within 20 weeks from infection became normal in 38% of cases on the third study, while only 1/10 abnormal DMSA scans performed more than 20 weeks after infection became normal after 1.5-3.9 y. Persistent renal changes were more common in children > 4 y of age than in children < or = 1 y of age. Two months after the presenting infection, it was unusual to see a normal DMSA scan in a child with a VUR gr. > or = 3. The study suggests that DMSA changes after an index UTI may be transient for a longer period of time than has been previously considered. Therefore, in order to detect persistent changes, a DMSA scan should be performed more than 5 months after UTI."

UTI was diagnosed in the presence of symptoms of infection together with any colony growth for a single pathogen from urine obtained by suprapubic aspiration, or >or=10(4) CFU/ml for a single pathogen from urine obtained by urethral catheterization. Abnormal renal ultrasound was present in 37.1% of cases (34% in community-acquired UTI and 54.5% in nosocomial UTI, P < 0.01). The voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) showed vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in 27% of cases (23.8% in community-acquired UTI and 48.6% in nosocomial UTI, P < 0.01). In patients with abnormal renal ultrasound and VUR, renal scan with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) performed early after UTI revealed cortical defects in 69.5% of cases. However, in patients with abnormal renal ultrasound and normal VCUG, DMSA also revealed cortical defects in 39% of cases. The absence of VUR in neonates with UTI and abnormal renal ultrasound does not exclude the presence of cortical defects suggestive of pyelonephritis."

Because of the paucity of symptoms concomitant with congenital malformations it is important to use this non-invasive exploration method frequently in the early course of the diagnostic investigations. Pathologic sonographic findings should be followed by radiologic exploration. In case of normal renal sonography in patients suffering from first urinary tract infection, further radiologic exploration of the upper urinary tract can be withheld, however ultrasound does not replace radiologic studies of the lower urinary tract. Complications after surgical procedures are readily depicted by sonography, thus avoiding the need for numerous post-operative radiologic study."

CD010657,0,21325495,0,Assessing vesicoureteral reflux in live inbred mice via ultrasound with a microbubble contrast agent.,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common pediatric anomaly linked to renal scarring and hypertension. Although there are many mouse VUR models, cystograms have previously only been performed in euthanized animals, thus preventing serial assessments for VUR in the same animal and not delineating ""live"" physiology. Our purpose was to develop a live murine cystogram assay that could be used serially to track reflux. We injected microbubbles via transurethral catheters into bladders of C57BL6/J and C3H/HeJ inbred mouse strains that are known to have low and high VUR rates, respectively. We performed ultrasound to visualize microbubbles in the renal pelvis to determine feasibility of the procedure. We then repeated the microbubble ultrasound using a transducer allowing for visualization of both kidneys and ureters simultaneously and for 3 dimensional (3D) reconstruction. We then performed ""euthanized"" cystograms on all mice for comparison. C3H/HeJ mice had a strong and persistent microbubble signal in the renal pelvis and ureters bilaterally with low-contrast infusion volumes (<100 μl) and similarly showed bilateral reflux by euthanized cystograms. With larger infused volumes (≥150 μl), C57BL6/J mice had small volumes of microbubbles in the renal pelvis that cleared quickly and did not show reflux on euthanized cystograms. Thus, using animal models of known VUR, we demonstrate the utility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound to visualize reflux in live mice."

CD010657,0,25045883,0,Paediatric vesicoureteric reflux imaging: where are we? Novel ultrasound-based voiding urosonography.,"Vesicoureteric reflux is an important association of paediatric urinary tract infection. Fluoroscopic micturating cystourethrography and radionuclide cystography have been employed for detecting and grading vesicoureteric reflux. However, both modalities involve ionising radiation, which can pose significant radiation risk to growing children. They also have a lower detection rate due to intermittent fluoroscopic technique in micturating cystourethrography, and lower spatial resolution in radionuclide cystography. Therefore, newer radiation-free ultrasound-based contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography has been developed in Europe for 15 years. This article aimed to summarise the current literature and discuss the first local pilot study in our institution on detection of vesicoureteric reflux by contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography. Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography is a valid alternative to micturating cystourethrography in assessing vesicoureteric reflux, based on its superior diagnostic performance, reliability, safety, feasibility, and radiation safety for children. Therefore, it should be incorporated in the guideline for investigating paediatric urinary tract infection."

Even in non-functioning kidneys the urinary tract was clearly depicted by RARE-MR-urography. However, no differentiation could be made with this technique between vesicoureteral reflux and non-refluxing dilatation of ureter and/or renal pelvis. All 19 pelviureteric obstructions and all eight renal duplications with a dilated segment were identified. RARE-MR-urography is a new tool for diagnosing urinary tract abnormalities in children without having to employ ionizing radiation, contrast media, or general anesthesia. A dilated urinary tract can be shown in one image displaying the entire urinary system, similar to excretory urography. The technique is presently not able to provide the information of voiding cystourethrography or renal scintigraphy, nor is it as easy to perform as ultrasound. However, in certain cases it may replace excretory urography."
CD010657,0,1749673,0,Salt losing nephropathy simulating congenital adrenal hyperplasia in infants with obstructive uropathy and/or vesicoureteral reflux--value of ultrasonography in diagnosis.,"Salt losing nephropathy, occurring predominantly in male infants, has been reported in association with a spectrum of urologic diseases including obstructive uropathy and massive, infected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). This has been called pseudo-hypoaldosteronism (PHA) or alternatively, pseudo salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and is thought to reflect a tubular unresponsiveness to aldosterone. We report our experience with six cases, discuss one case in detail and review the 39 cases previously reported. A one month old male infant presented with a left upper quadrant mass. Signs and symptoms included vomiting, dehydration, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. This suggested the diagnosis of CAH for which therapy was instituted. Ultrasonographic examination subsequently revealed the mass to be a urinoma in an infant with posterior urethral valve (PUV) and obstructive hydronephrosis."

CD010657,0,20467791,1,Vesicoureteral reflux in children with suspected and proven urinary tract infection.,"The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and clinically significant ultrasonography (US) abnormalities in a large group of children with proven and suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). The medical reports on renal US and voiding cystouretrographies (VCUG) of 2,036 children were reviewed. Renal US was performed on all children and VCUG on 1,185 children (58%). Based on the urine culture data, the UTI diagnoses were classified into five reliability classes (proven, likely, unlikely, false and no microbial data). The UTI diagnose was considered proven in 583/2036 (28.6%) and false in 145 (7.1%) cases. The prevalence of VUR was similar among those with proven and false UTI [37.4 vs. 34.8%; relative risk (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 0.7-1.7, P = 0.75] and decreased with increasing age (P = 0.001). Clinically significant US abnormalities occurred in 87/583 (14.9%) cases with proven UTI and significantly less often (11/145, 7.6%) in the false UTI class (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.1-3.6, P = 0.02). Our finding supports the claim that VUR is not significantly associated to UTI and that its occurrence among children even without UTI is significantly higher than traditional estimates. This challenges the recommendations of routine VCUG after UTI."
CD010657,0,1915489,0,Detecting vesico-ureteral reflux in asymptomatic siblings of children with reflux by direct radionuclide cystography.,"The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) among asymptomatic siblings of children with VUR is much higher than the estimated incidence in the general population. It might be expected that identifying them and keeping them under close observation and/or either surgical or conservative treatment, might reduce the risk of renal scarring. Fifty-three asymptomatic children, all under 6 years of age and all siblings of children with proven VUR, were studied and direct radionuclide voiding cystography (DRVC). There were 31 (58%) boys, and 22 (42%) girls. Nine children (17%) were younger than 1 year, 13 (25%) were between 1 and 2 years of age, while 31 (58%) were older than 2 years. VUR was detected in 22 (42%) of the 53 siblings. The incidence of VUR varied considerably according to the age, and sex of the child, the highest being in boys younger than 1 year. Most of the severe reflux was seen in children under 2 years of age. Out of 11 patients with VUR, grade 2 and 3, there were 10 younger than 2 years, whereas, only 2 of the 11 siblings with VUR, grade 1 were younger than 2 years of age. The mean age of children with VUR grades 2 and 3 was 19 months, compared to the mean age of 50 months for those with VUR grade 1. DRVC, a highly sensitive method, exposes the patient to much less radiation than X-ray voiding cystography. We believe that the benefit of detecting VUR in asymptomatic siblings with DRVC outweights the invasiveness of the procedure. The predictive value of positive family history alone in identifying VUR in our study was 42%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010657,0,9584940,0,Diurnal and nocturnal enuresis in a 6 year old.,"Justin is a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who presented with daytime and night-time wetting. He had been toilet trained at the age of 3 years but was back in diapers as a result of the enuresis. His bowel movements were normal. The initial evaluation consisted of a urinalysis, urine culture, serum creatinine level, and renal/bladder ultrasound examination. The urine studies were normal. The serum creatinine level was elevated at 1.0 mg/dL. The ultrasound examination revealed bilateral mild hydronephrosis and a thickened bladder wall. A voiding cystourethrogram was ordered to evaluate anatomy, but Justin would not allow a Foley catheter to be inserted, so the procedure, along with cystoscopy, was performed under anesthesia. Cystoscopy revealed a highly trabeculated bladder, as is seen in either high-grade obstruction or a neurogenic bladder. The cystogram did not show any obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux. Meanwhile, Justin's symptoms continued to increase to the point at which he was constantly wet, and he no longer made any attempts to void on his own. A spinal magnetic resonance imaging study did not show any occult neurologic lesions. Urodynamic studies revealed a high-pressure bladder, poor emptying, and inappropriate voluntary contraction of the striated, urinary sphincter during micturition. Despite institution of anticholinergic medication, psychotherapy, and behavioral therapy, Justin continued to do poorly. He could not tolerate clean intermittent catheterization, and he eventually required a suprapubic tube for urinary drainage and preservation of his kidneys."

The inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 play an important role in response to bacterial infection. This prospective study investigated the association between serum and urine IL-6 and IL-8 levels and acute pyelonephritis confirmed by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. A total of 78 children aged 1-121 months with a diagnosis of first-time febrile UTI were included. The following inflammatory markers were assessed: fever; white blood cells count (WBC); C-reactive protein (CRP); and serum and urine IL-6 and IL-8. The patients were divided into the acute pyelonephritis group (n=42) and the lower UTI group (n=36) according to the results of DMSA scan. Fever, WBC and CRP levels were significantly higher in children with acute pyelonephritis than in those with lower UTI (all p <0.001). Significantly, higher initial serum and urine IL-6 and IL-8 levels were found in children with acute pyelonephritis than in those with lower UTI (all p <0.001). Serum and urine IL-6 in children with acute pyelonephritis were positively correlated with fever, CRP and leucocyturia. These results indicate that both serum and urine IL-6 and IL-8 levels, particularly IL-6, are useful diagnostic tools for early recognition of acute pyelonephritis in febrile children."

The presence and extent of scarring, as determined by postmortem examination, was compared with that detected by technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans performed before sacrifice. Sixty female piglets (62 refluxing units) were studied. Overall the sensitivity (true-positive/(true-positive + false-negative)) of DMSA scanning in detecting macroscopic scarring was 85% and the specificity (true-negative/(true-negative + false-positive)) was 97%. There were five false-negatives, four of which were in kidneys with minor scarring and one in which there was major scarring. There were three false-positives. We conclude that DMSA scanning has a high specificity and sensitivity in detecting renal scars in female piglets, and suggest it is the preferred method for detecting renal scars in clinical practice."

Appropriate techniques of urine sampling play an important role for accurate microbiological diagnosis. In infants urine sampling by bladder puncture or transurethral catheter is recommended. In young infants with suspected pyelonephritis, calculated antibiotic treatment should be initiated parenterally with a combination of a third generation cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside with ampicillin. After the age of 3-6 months group 3 oral cephalosporins can be used in uncomplicated pyelonephritis. With the first febrile UTI early sonography is recommended to provide information about renal parenchymal involvement and to exclude malformations of the kidneys and urinary tract. Strategies for the recognition of vesicoureteral reflux and renal damage are under discussion. Recently published guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics for the diagnosis and management of UTI in febrile children and infants aged 2-24 months will most likely influence the still pending German guidelines."

Abnormal RUS and VCUG results were noted in 5.1% (24 of 471) and 20.4% (75 of 368) of infants, respectively. While the abnormal US rate is significantly less than what has been previously reported, the frequency of abnormal VCUGs is similar. These results suggest that a post-UTI RUS may not be needed if the prenatal US was normal. However, a VCUG continues to be indicated."

The sensitivity and specificity of direct radionuclide cystography to detect VUR as compared to micturating cystourethrography is 95% and 95.8% respectively. The localization and appearance of ureteric orifices which were classified as per Lyon's classification greatly enhanced the predictive value of determining past or present VUR.

CD010657,0,15085265,0,[Urethral valves. Fate of the bladder and upper urinary tract].,"Posterior urethral valve is a condition that leads to characteristic changes in the bladder and upper tracts. The bladder develops hypertrophic changes including muscular hypertrophy, dilatation of the prostatic urethra (keyhole appearance), and progressive hydroureteronephrosis. The voiding cystourethrogram confirms the diagnosis and documents vesicoureteral reflux and accompanying bladder changes. The follow-up of the serum creatinine level is a parameter for renal recovery. In our opinion, primary endoscopic ablation of the valves followed by a wait-and-see attitude is the most efficacious management of posterior urethral valves. The development of the bladder function is controlled by ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram. Urodynamics provide a formal and objective means of assessing bladder function, but should be carefully applied in infants. Valve ablation in a neonate with significant reflux and a markedly trabeculated bladder can remodel itself remarkably within the 1st year of life. The persistence of hydronephrosis, bladder wall thickening and trabeculation, and persistent elevation of serum creatinine can all be harbingers that a degree of bladder outlet obstruction persists and one needs to rule out a persistent anatomic obstruction. At what point a functional obstruction occurs and which management is reasonable are still issues of debate and require the vigilance of a pediatric urologist to sort out. Dysfunctions of the bladder such as hyperreflexia, hypertonic, small capacity bladder, sphincter incompetence and/or myogenic failure should be adequately treated."

In 17 renal units (15 patients) VCUG showed reflux to the ureter, but not to the renal pelvis, whereas DRNC revealed backflow from the bladder up to the renal pelvis. Reflux visualized at DRNC but not at VCUG was defined as grade Io. In all cases with reflux of grade I according to current classifications, DRNC showed reflux up to the renal pelvis. These observations make the distinction between grades I and II reflux in presently used classification less relevant and indicated the possible pathway of renal infection in patients with grade I vesicoureteral reflux and in so-called ""elusive"" reflux.

This study describes the findings of ureterocele eversion and lower pole vesicoureteral reflux in duplex kidneys on VCUG and demonstrates how its appearance can be misleading.

CD010657,0,9060135,0,Postnatal vesico-ureteral reflux in a boy with urinary bladder dysfunction as the only prenatal sonographic sign.,"An antenatal ultrasonographic examination of a male fetus at 31, 33 and 36 weeks' gestation revealed grossly abnormal bladder function. The bladder cycle length, residual volumes and the degree of distention all markedly deviated from normal, although hydronephrosis which is indicative of vesico-ureteral reflux could not be detected. Furthermore, postnatally no anatomical urethral obstruction was found to explain the high bladder volumes. Postnatal investigation revealed bilateral reflux and bladder dysfunction with detrusor instability, a reduced bladder capacity and a high voiding pressure similar to that observed in boys with anatomic obstruction of the urethra and/or posterior urethral valves. These findings add to the controversy concerning the genesis of vesico-ureteral reflux and have implications for the prenatal assessment of bladder function in cases of suspected vesico-ureteral reflux."
CD010657,0,2112833,0,Importance of prenatal detection of hydronephrosis of the upper pole.,"To determine the impact of prenatal detection on neonates with hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system, we reviewed 40 such cases seen between June 1982 and April 1989. This six-per-year rate contrasts with fewer than one case per year that was seen at our hospital from 1947 to 1977. Nineteen patients had an ectopic ureterocele, and 21 had an ectopic ureter without a ureterocele. Thirty-three (83%) were girls. Thirty-three cases were discovered because of abnormal findings on a prenatal sonogram, and 20 of those infants were asymptomatic. In the 33 patients whose prenatal sonographic findings were abnormal, the sonogram was diagnostically precise for hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system in only 39%. This imprecision did not adversely affect management or outcome. Postnatal sonography modified the prenatal diagnosis in 75% of these 33 patients. Voiding cystourethrography was the most sensitive and precise imaging technique for detecting both ureterocele and reflux. Lower pole reflux was almost twice as common when an ectopic ureterocele was present (63%) than when one was not (33%). Prenatal sonographic detection of hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system decreased the proportion of neonates presenting with urinary tract infection and urosepsis because of prophylactic antibiotics initiated at birth and continued until surgical correction. Precise prenatal diagnosis was not needed for effective surgical treatment."

Initially the natural history of vesicoureteric reflux was examined by investigating 350 infants with urinary infection by intravenous urography and micturating cystourethrography. The 40% demonstrating reflux were followed up for approximately 12 years. The study showed that infancy and early childhood were the critical periods for renal damage to occur, that the damage was confined to those kidneys subjected to severe degrees of reflux, that lesser degrees of reflux were not associated with renal damage and that a spontaneous lessening of the severity of reflux occurred with increasing age. Other aspects of reflux nephropathy also have been studied including pathogenic mechanisms resulting in renal damage, ultrasonography to examine fetal anatomy, radioisotopic methods for demonstrating renal scarring and reflux, and the long term follow up of adults with reflux nephropathy."
CD010657,0,12111190,0,The accuracy of voiding urosonography in detecting vesico-ureteral reflux: a summary of existing data.,"The primary objective of this review was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of voiding urosonography (VUS) in detecting reflux (VUR). As a secondary objective, the reported technical suggestions and diagnostic mistakes were shown to improve the examination protocol and provide the most accurate results. Using a Medline Database search, the published articles comparing the grey-scale (GS) or colour-Doppler (CD) VUS with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) as the gold standard were selected. Articles were excluded when data were not sufficient to construct 2x2 tables or when the gold standard was different from VCUG. For the analyses of diagnostic accuracy values, 95% confidence intervals were given. Agreements in the results of GSVUS and VCUG and in those of CDVUS and VCUG were determined by Kappa statistics. GSVUS and CDVUS were compared for diagnostic accuracy by the McNemar test. Results showed that the range of GSVUS sensitivity and specificity in detecting VUR was 69%-100% and 86%-97%, respectively. The agreement between GSVUS and VCUG diagnoses ranged from 90% to 97% (K score range 0.61-0.92; P<0.001). The range of CDVUS sensitivity and specificity in detecting VUR was 93%-100% and 86%-93%, respectively. The agreement between CDVUS and VCUG diagnoses ranged from 89% to 96% (K score range 0.77-0.91; P<0.001). One study comparing both VUS modalities with VCUG in the same group of patients, showed that the diagnostic accuracy of CDVUS was significantly higher than that of GSVUS (96% versus 90% of cases correctly classified; McNemar chi squared =4; P<0.05)."

According to the clinical tests performed the patients underwent excretory urography (EU) and/or voiding cystouretrography (VCU); the results were compared to US findings. In the 75 patients with malformations, US proved to be extremely sensitive in abdominal renal ectopies, in ""horseshoe"" kidney, and in congenital obstructions of the ureteropelvic and vesico-ureteral junctions. US showed a higher sensitivity than EU in identifying multicystic kidney and in most cases of hypodysplasia. On the other hand, VCU was more accurate in vesico-ureteral reflux studies; US should thus be used in the follow-up of the patients undergoing medical therapy. EU must however be considered as the most important tool in the evaluation of early renal injuries and their possible development."

We sought to determine this for infants with a family history of reflux. From June 1989 to September 1996, 157 children (80 males) under 2 years with a family history of primary VUR in a first-degree relative had VCUG. VCUG results were compared with the fetal renal pelvic diameter on obstetric sonogram performed after 16 weeks gestation. Of the 157 infants, 33 (11 boys) had primary VUR. In those with a parent as the index case, the prevalence of reflux was 5% in boys and 35% in girls ( P=0.03). The largest renal pelvic diameter after 16 weeks was not discriminatory for VUR, but after 30 weeks gestation a 4 mm renal pelvis had a sensitivity of 33% and a PPV of 32%. The sensitivity was higher for grades 4 and 5 (75%) than for grades 1-3 reflux (17%), ( P=0.04). In conclusion, fetal renal pelvic diameter has a low sensitivity and poor predictive value for detecting VUR, but this improves a little after 30 weeks gestation."

CD010657,0,2644663,0,Neonatal hydronephrosis due to primary vesicoureteral reflux: trends in diagnosis and treatment.,"The records were reviewed of the 25 neonates found to have hydronephrosis due to primary vesicoureteral reflux at the authors' hospital in the 6 1/2-year period from January 1981 to June 1987. Modes of discovery and investigation, detection of associated lesions, treatment, and errors in both diagnosis and management were evaluated. Twenty-one of the neonates were boys. Fourteen cases were found at fetal screening, and the infants were asymptomatic. Inappropriate maternal/fetal intervention occurred in four cases: Three were incorrectly thought to have posterior urethral valves. The increased number of neonates found to have reflux is attributable to the widespread availability of obstetric ultrasonography and early screening of infants at risk for urinary tract abnormalities. Since the pathophysiologic characteristics of reflux are well understood, appropriate postnatal therapy can be instituted without delay."

CD010657,0,2184215,0,Reflux nephropathy secondary to intrauterine vesicoureteric reflux.,"In 107 infants with 182 antenatally diagnosed urinary tract anomalies, 24 had either unilateral (12) or bilateral (12) vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). The VUR was more common in boys (male to female ratio, 16:8) and usually severe (grades IV [16], III [10], II [4], and I [6]). Intravenous pyelography showed the changes of atrophic pyelonephritis in 10 refluxing units, and in another two with an associated pelviureteric junctional hydronephrosis. Lateral ectopia of the ureteric orifices was noted in six of these 10 refluxing renal units. Isotopic renography showed a reduction in function in nine of the 14 patients examined, ranging between 9% and 41%. (45% and above was considered within the normal range). Only two patients developed a urinary infection before intravenous pyelography or isotopic renography was performed, suggesting that renal changes noted were primary rather than secondary. Findings support the hypothesis that foetal VUR may be a contributing factor in the causation of atrophic pyelonephritis (foetal reflux nephropathy) observed in these patients."
CD010657,0,22046789,0,"The prognosis of posterior urethral valves, associated to vesicoureteral reflux in children.","Posterior urethral valves represent a congenital barrier at the level of the posterior urethra, which opposes miction. They are located near the prostatic urethra, originating at the verumontanum level, affecting male patients. The ureters are inconstantly dilated; vesicoureteral reflux is met in 2/3 of the cases. The reflux can be secondary to the sub-bladder barrier, but it can also be considered primitive, determined by the intra bladder ectopy of the ureter. The presence of the reflux is interpreted as a severe associated factor. Semiology is rather unusual, positive diagnosis is based on early discovery or antenatally of the impairment, by fetal echography starting from the 28th week of pregnancy, postnatal echography followed by miction cystography, retrograde urethrography and creatinine dosage complete the diagnosis. The treatment is surgical: endoscopic ablation of the valves (in the absence of renal failure), percutaneous pyelostomy, high lateral ureterostomy, and in severe cases vesicostomy and renal transplant. Prognosis depends on how early the impairment is detected, on the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia, on the presence of the vesicoureteral reflux and the possibility of recovering renal function; 1/3 of the newborns develop in time Chronic Renal Failure which requires renal transplant. The studied group comprised male children diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux their ages ranking between 0 -18 years, admitted to the Pediatric Clinic, Tg. Mures during the last 10 years and children diagnosed and operated with posterior urethra valves at the Surgical Clinic of the ""M. S. Curie"" Hospital, Bucharest during the last 20 years. Our results show that out of the total number of studied children 25 presented posterior urethra valves and 9 children presented vesicoureteral reflux. We can conclude that the presence of the vesicoureteral reflux is an unfavorable prognosis regarding the degree of renal failure."
CD010657,0,25454051,0,Neonatal imaging evaluation of common prenatally diagnosed genitourinary abnormalities.,"With the implementation of prenatal screening with ultrasound (US) and, more recently, fetal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, patterns of referral have changed. US remains the first-line imaging modality for evaluating the genitourinary system during the neonatal period and may be enhanced with the use of focused, high-resolution linear images of the pyramids. US has been successful because of its dynamic nature, the excellent morphologic visualization provided in neonates, lack of ionizing radiation, low cost, and lack of need for sedation to acquire the images. US is frequently coupled with mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG-3) scanning, providing a powerful combination for morphologic and functional assessment. MR imaging, specifically functional MR urography, has been increasingly used because of its excellent delineation of anatomy achieved without ionizing radiation. MR urography is regarded as a ""one-stop-shop examination,"" as it can provide both anatomical and functional information. It also plays an important role in the evaluation of ureteral ectopia and genital anomalies. Review of available antenatal studies provides invaluable information that may have prognostic significance or may obviate the need for additional examinations or both. Fluoroscopy is typically reserved for assessing vesicoureteral reflux or for detecting urethral abnormalities. In this review, an update on the imaging strategies for common genitourinary anomalies in neonates is presented and illustrated."

Although even minor abnormalities could be detected by antenatal ultrasound, the identification of the abnormal findings was not possible in every case. Diagnostic problems arose in 8 foetuses showing mild dilatation of the collecting system, since it was not possible to distinguish between functional dilatation and dilatation from vesicoureteral reflux or minimal ureteral obstruction. Difficulties in identification of large malformations also occurred in 3 other patients, if the first sonographic examination was performed in a late stage of pregnancy, so that no follow-up of the sonographic picture was possible. In one of these children a huge right-sided multicystic kidney resulted in compression of the contralateral ureter with hydronephrosis, damaging the other kidney. Early delivery should, therefore, be considered in all children showing large cystic abdominal masses and no identifiable normal kidney, so that adequate obstetric treatment of these patients can be initiated in time."

If transient obstruction occurred after uncomplicated antireflux ureterovesico-plasties (n = 41), it lasted at most 4 weeks. Kidneys with transient postoperative ureterovesical junction obstruction (n = 21) reverted to normal sonographic pattern within 4 weeks following ureteral reimplantation.

Functional impairment was found in 21 renal units. To evaluate the significance of the time between voiding and complete disappearance of the radioisotope that refluxed from the kidney (retention time) the presence of the labeled particles in the kidney was followed continuously and intermittently during a prolonged interval. There was a significant difference between the retention time found in the impaired kidneys and that in the normally functioning kidneys. In 91.7 per cent of the normally functioning kidneys retention time was less than 5 minutes, whereas in 86 per cent of the impaired kidneys it was more than 10 minutes and in 56 per cent it was more than 20 minutes. No significant correlation was found between the retention time and intrarenal reflux or dilatation of the collecting system (patients classified as having radiological grades III and IV reflux were not included in this study). A retention time greater than 10 minutes may be correlated with decreased renal function. The retention of technetium sulfur colloid particles may be analogous to the retention of similar size bacteria and suggests a possible pathophysiologic explanation for the development of renal dysfunction owing to the prolonged presence of bacteria in the kidney after reflux."

CD010657,0,3883621,0,Current issues regarding posterior urethral valves.,"There are a number of factors that affect ureteral dilatation in patients with posterior urethral valves. These include large urinary outputs, a noncompliant bladder, and distal ureteric fibrosis. Dilatation alone does not imply obstruction, and careful studies should be obtained to document obstruction prior to considering any surgery. Our prejudice leads us to avoid ureteric reconstruction in the period immediately after valve ablation. Our findings suggest that these patients have hypertonic bladders immediately after valve ablation period, so it could be hazardous to reimplant the ureter in such a bladder and thereby expose these kidneys to unnecessary high pressures. Each patient with persistent dilatation should be treated on an individual basis. Some will require no treatment, some reimplantation with or without tailoring, and some an augmentation cystoplasty. More conservative approaches include double and triple voiding regimens, intermittent catheterization, anticholinergics, alpha sympathomimetic blockers, and regimens to decrease urinary output. These same regimens also seem to have a role in improving the level of continence, as does the onset of adolescence. Fortunately, the majority of patients with posterior urethral valves can be treated with valve ablation alone. Unfortunately, a number of patients who have creatinines of less than 1.0 mg per dl following treatment in the first year of life will go onto renal failure years later. Rapid progression to renal failure usually does not ensue until the teenage period, when proteinuria and hypertension seem to be the hallmarks. The progressive renal failure that develops in these patients may be related to the hyperfiltration syndrome that Brenner and Levine reported in patients with a decreased number of nephrons. A role for decreased intake of protein may have some influence in preserving the function of patients with a reduced number of nephrons and hopefully will affect the ultimate prognosis. The author anxiously awaits the formation and results of studies that will employ such a dietary regimen for patients with a history of severe valves in the hope of preserving renal function. However, such reports are not likely to be forthcoming during this decade."
CD010657,0,16791609,0,Vesicoureteral reflux increases the risk of renal scars: a study of unilateral reflux.,"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on renal scar following acute pyelonephritis by comparing the refluxing renal units with nonrefluxing renal units in children with unilateral primary VUR. Forty-eight children with unilateral primary VUR diagnosed after the first pyelonephritis were enrolled. Mean age of patients was 1.0+/-1.6 years (29 boys and 19 girls). All patients underwent renal ultrasonography and renal 99 m-technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan within three days following the diagnosis of pyelonephritis, and voiding cystourethrography (VCU) was performed soon after fever subsided and the infection was controlled. The DMSA scan was rechecked six months after the initial study when the first scan showed a renal defect. The first DMSA showed renal defects in 34 (70.8%) out of 48 of the refluxing renal units and in 13 (27.1%) out of 48 of the nonrefluxing renal units (P<0.01, OR: 6.54). At six months after the infection, 23 (47.9%) out of 48 refluxing renal units and seven (14.6%) out of 48 nonrefluxing renal units had renal scars on DMSA scan (P<0.01, OR: 5.39). The prevalence of renal scars did not vary significantly according to the grade of VUR. The CRP level on admission was significantly higher in patients with acute renal defect and scar. In conclusion, VUR increases the risk of post-pyelonephritic renal scars in children."
CD010657,0,15883823,0,Associated anomalies in children with congenital solitary functioning kidney.,"Congenital solitary functioning kidney (CSFK) is a relatively common renal malformation and in children is frequently complicated by anomalies of the ipsilateral genital organs and occasionally by anomalies of other organs. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of associated urological, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological, skeletal, and other congenital malformations in children with CSFK. We retrospectively reviewed 87 consecutive cases of CSFK diagnosed at our hospital between 1995 and 2003. There were 45 boys and 42 girls, whose ages at diagnosis ranged from newborn to 16 years (mean 4.67+/-4.48 years). In all patients, CSFK was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound and confirmed by radionuclide studies. In 46 patients (53%) the left kidney was absent, and in 41 patients (47%) the right kidney was absent. Overall associated anomalies were detected in 52 of the 87 children (60%) with CSFK. Urological anomalies were most common, with an incidence of 37% (32/87). Nonurological anomalies were detected in 38 children (44%) with CSFK; these included cardiac anomalies in 13, gastrointestinal anomalies in eight, hematological anomalies in five, neurological anomalies in three, and other organ anomalies in nine. In our study, more than half of the patients with CSFK had associated anomalies. For this reason we recommend abdominal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram for early recognition of urological anomalies and a careful physical examination for other organ anomalies in patients with CSFK."

CD010657,0,3883627,0,Management of myelomeningocele.,"The care of the patient with myelomeningocele has improved over the last 15 years. Early diagnosis of urodynamic abnormalities and close monitoring of the urinary tract by ultrasonography have allowed the institution of prompt, effective therapy before upper-tract deterioration can occur. The wide acceptance of clean intermittent catheterization can in most circumstances eliminate the need for urinary diversion. Clean intermittent catheterization can alleviate reflux and in 85 per cent of children can promote continence. The adolescent and adult will continue to require observation and management to ensure their active place in society."

CD010657,0,20524012,0,Antenatal and postnatal ultrasound in the evaluation of the risk of vesicoureteral reflux.,"Antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) is a frequent anomaly detected on fetal ultrasound scans. There is no consensus recommendation for the postnatal follow-up and/or the necessity to perform a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) to diagnose vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). We conducted a cohort/non-randomized trial of 121 patients with ANH, defined as an anterior posterior diameter (APD) >or=5 mm after the 20th week of gestation, to evaluate the ability of the antenatal and postnatal ultrasonography results to predict VUR. All infants had two successive ultrasounds at 5 days and 1 month, respectively, after birth. A VCUG was performed at 6 weeks in children with a persistent APD >or=5 mm and/or an ureteral dilatation observed on at least one of two postnatal ultrasounds. In total, 88 patients had VCUG and nine had VUR, with five having high-grade reflux (>grade II). The risk of VUR increased significantly with the degree of APD detected on the postnatal ultrasound scan (p = 0.03). The odds ratios were 5.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5-51.2] for APD = 7-9 mm and 9.1 (95% CI 1.0-80.9) for APD >or=10 mm. The results of this study show that among our patient cohort antenatal ultrasound was not predictive of reflux. There was, however, a relation between the importance of the postnatal renal pelvis diameter and the risk of VUR. A cut-off of 7 mm showed a fair ability of ultrasonography to predict VUR and a cut-off of 10 mm enabled all severe refluxes in the 88 patients who had a VCUG to be diagnosed."

These contrast agents have been widely used in adult cardiology patients to improve endocardial border delineation and have been proved safe and well tolerated in this patient population. There is also a growing body of literature elucidating the value of contrast-enhanced sonography to distinguish benign from malignant liver lesions in adults and to characterize non-hepatic adult malignancies. Because these agents have not been approved for pediatric use in many countries, less is known of the value of contrast-enhanced sonography in children.

A new imaging procedure, voiding urosonography (VUS) with contrast medium, has recently been introduced. We have carried out a comparative study of these three techniques in 157 patients (aged 6 weeks-4.7 years). VUS showed the presence of VUR in 91 of 311 renal units; VCUG detected reflux in 64 of 233 renal units, and the DRVC in 23 of 78 renal units. VCUG and VUS were compared in 118 patients, and both procedures showed the same grade of reflux in 56 refluxing units (kappa value 0.92); in six cases the reflux grade was greater at VUS than at VCUG. Seven cases of reflux detected by VUS were not identified on VCUG. VCUG did not show a grade of VUR that was higher than in VUS in any patient. In the identification of 4 degrees-5 degrees grade reflux, the sensitivity of VUS reached 100%. VUS and DRVC were found to be equally effective in the detection of VUR (kappa value 0.85). In conclusion, we found that VUS is a useful method for the diagnosis and grading of patients with VUR."

CD010657,0,7741578,1,Urinary tract infection: a comparison of four methods of investigation.,"The optimal regimen for investigating children with urinary tract infection (UTI) remains uncertain. Ultrasonography, contrast micturating cystourethrography (MCU), intravenous urography (IVU), and technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) studies were performed in 58 children with UTI under 14 years of age attending two teaching hospitals and the results compared. All four investigations were normal in 12 children. In 36 with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on MCU, dilatation was reported on ultrasonography in eight children. Radiological renal scarring was seen in 20 children; it was suspected on ultrasonography in nine, with dilatation alone in four, and a normal report in seven. Duplex kidneys identified on IVU were unrecognised on ultrasonography or DMSA studies; ultrasonography showed no change corresponding to presumed acute defects on DMSA studies that later resolved. Disparities were observed at all ages. This study suggests that ultrasonography is unreliable in detecting VUR, renal scarring, or inflammatory change and, alone, is inadequate for investigating UTI in children."
CD010657,0,7741579,0,Pitfalls in the investigation of children with urinary tract infection.,"The histories and imaging results are presented in 10 children in whom errors had been made in the interpretation of early investigations. Ultrasonography may not detect either vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) or renal scars or inflammation. The reduced nephrogram or renal swelling following a first attack of acute pyelonephritis may not be recognised without renal measurement on an intravenous urogram. Renal scarring may be diagnosed incorrectly on the basis of functional defects of isotope uptake on a technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid study. In the absence of VUR, the micturating cystogram will not visualise the kidneys."
CD010657,0,18685869,0,TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms and primary vesicoureteral reflux in childhood.,"The aim of this study was to assess the association between the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) gene polymorphisms rs1800469 (commonly known as T-509C) and rs1982073 (commonly known as Leu (10)-->Pro) and primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and renal scarring. Using a case-control approach, we examined 121 children with primary VUR and 169 controls. Genotyping of the TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The (99m)Tc-DMSA- or (99m)Tc-unitiol-single photon emission computed tomography method was used to evaluate renal scars in 84 of 121 VUR children. Statistical analysis revealed differences in rs1800469 genotype frequencies between VUR patients and controls (p = 0.0021). Our data demonstrate that individuals homozygous for the TT genotype are at risk of primary VUR [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 2.7 (1.46-5.08)]. Distribution of the rs1982073 polymorphism was similar in VUR children and controls. In terms of renal scarring, patients were stratified into non-scar and scar subgroups, and no differences in the genotype frequencies of either polymorphism was found. Previous reports have shown that the TT genotype of the rs1800469 polymorphism is a risk factor for renal scarring in primary VUR, and the results of our study suggest that this same polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to this congenital uropathy."

One patient was 10 years of age, with international grade III reflux of the left ureter; the other was 27 years of age, with grade II reflux of the right ureter. The respective operating times were 6 h 40 min and 6 h 10 min. There were no complications during surgery.

Reflux, shown by either of the two methods, was regarded as an indication of the disorder. Neither method was regarded as a standard reference method. Agreement between the two methods was obtained in 90 of 102 renal units, i.e., ureter and/or renal pelvis (88%).

A direct correlation (93 per cent) between an increasing bladder volume at which reflux occurs was observed in the clinically stable group. In the clinically unstable group there was a 77 per cent correlation of an unchanged or decreasing bladder volume at which reflux occurs. The quantitative nuclear cystogram provides an objective as opposed to subjective data base for management of patients with vesicoureteral reflux.
CD010657,0,20680621,0,Molecular ultrasound imaging and its potential for paediatric radiology.,"US is a low-cost, real-time imaging modality that is the most used diagnostic tool in paediatric radiology. Reasons include the improved US image quality in children as compared to adults and the demand for avoiding X-rays as much as possible because children are more sensitive to radiation than adults. Stabilized microbubbles have been approved as US contrast agents for adults and show great potential in improving the diagnostic accuracy for many diseases. Initial studies show that in paediatric radiology contrast-enhanced US could also be beneficial for more than just the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux, if US contrast agents were approved for children. Molecular US imaging utilizes microbubbles conjugated to biomolecules that target intravascular disease-specific molecules. Many preclinical studies show that molecular US imaging is a highly sensitive tool to detect neovascularisation, inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. Its main advantages are the higher informative value, the longer persistence of the label at the target lesion and the chance to work with lower contrast agent dosages. Now, clinical translation of molecular US appears at the horizon. This review article reports on the current status of molecular US imaging and discusses its potential for paediatric radiology."

Prognostic factors associated with fetal echography and clinical and laboratory findings were studied on admission. Median follow-up was 76 months. The analysis was conducted in two steps: in univariate analysis, variables associated with adverse outcome were identified by the Kaplan-Meier method. The variables that were significantly associated with adverse outcome were then included in a multivariate analysis using the Cox model. Eleven patients (50%) developed chronic renal failure (CRF) during follow-up. After adjustment by the multivariate model, four factors were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome: oligohydramnios (relative risk [RR] = 10.6, 95% CI = 2.7 - 77, P = 0.02), ventilatory support (RR = 6, 95% CI = 2 - 24, P = 0.01), urea higher than 40 mg/dl (RR = 3.7, 95% CI = 0.92 - 15.0, P = 0.06), and bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (RR = 6.1, 95% CI = 1.25 - 30, P = 0.02). On the other hand, the presence of unilateral VUR was a protective factor against the development of CRF or death during follow-up (RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.87 - 0.98, P = 0.05)."
CD010657,0,17639371,0,Voiding urosonography with US contrast agents for the diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux in children. II. Comparison with radiological examinations.,"Studies comparing voiding urosonography (VUS) with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and direct radionuclide cystography (DRNC) were analyzed and detailed tables demonstrating the diagnostic values and grading of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) are presented. Comparative studies of DRNC were too few and did not allow definite conclusions. Using VCUG as the reference, the results of VUS were as follows: sensitivity 57-100%, specificity 85-100%, positive/negative predictive values 58-100%/87-100%, respectively, and diagnostic accuracy 78-96%. With the exception of two studies the diagnostic accuracy reported was 90% and above. In 19% of pelviureteric units (PUUs) the diagnosis was made only by VUS and in 10% only by VCUG. Thus in 9% of PUUs more refluxes were detected using VUS. In 73.6% the reflux grades were concordant in VUS and VCUG. Reflux grade was found to be higher with VUS than with VCUG in 19.6% of PUUs. In 71.2% of PUUs with grade I reflux on VCUG, the reflux was found to be grade II and higher on VUS. The common selection criteria for VUS as the primary examination for VUR currently include (a) follow-up studies, (b) first examination for VUR in girls, and (c) screening high-risk patients."
CD010657,0,7920076,0,Clinical experience of posterior urethral valves.,"Nine patients with posterior urethral valves were seen at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1985 to 1992. The age at presentation ranged from five days old to 28 years old. The presenting symptoms and signs included abdominal distension, urinary tract infection, respiratory distress, urinary ascites, and weak stream. Patients were examined by voiding cystourethrography and ultrasonography. Surgical management of these patients included primary valve ablation (three cases), cutaneous vesicostomy plus delayed valve ablation (five cases) and primary valve ablation with delayed ureteral reimplantation (one case). For small infants with posterior urethral valves (five cases), temporary vesicostomy and delayed valve ablation offers excellent results in preventing iatrogenic urethral stricture. However, for older children and young adults, the recommended treatment is primary valve ablation. For seven patients with nadir serum creatinine < 1.0 mg/dL, the renal function remained within the normal range, yet during follow-up, one case had renal insufficiency. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in five cases. Spontaneous resolution was noted in two cases after valve ablation, and three cases were controlled with prophylactic antibiotics. The experience of our series suggests that primary valve ablation may be traumatic to the neonatal urethra and temporary diversion would allow greater renal recovery during the neonatal period. With newer delicate instruments, valve ablation may be performed earlier and as a one-stage operation in the future."
CD010657,0,2197478,0,[Evaluation of renal function in children with primary VUR up to two years old].,"The function of 99 refluxing kidneys of 61 children up to two years old at the time of diagnosis was evaluated by 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy, urinary beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-MG), alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha 1-MG) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamidase (NAG). High grade reflex (grade IV, V) was found in 45% of the cases. 76%, 51% and 92% of the cases showed abnormally high value of urinary beta 2-MG, alpha 1-MG and NAG, respectively. These results indicate that they have already had tubular dysfunction at the time of diagnosis. DMSA renoscintigraphy of 82 refluxing kidneys of 49 children was performed. Of these, 48% had renal scar and 28% had serious renal dysfunction [DMSA uptake rate less than 18%]. 10-20% of low grade VUR had less than 18% DMSA uptake rate. Two patterns were noticed in the group in which urinary beta 2-MG ranged 0.33-1.0. One was characterized by good bilateral renal function with slight tubular damage and the other serious renal dysfunction with fixed tubular damage. No remarkable recovery of the renal function was noticed after antireflux operation in the second pattern cases. In many cases, in which urinary beta 2-MG was more than 1.0, improvement of DMSA uptake rate was noticed after antireflux operation."

CD010657,0,25819592,0,[Imaging strategy for children after a first episode of pyelonephritis].,"Pyelonephritis is a common bacterial disease in young children and is a serious infection because of its potential to produce renal scarring. One of the concerns of physicians is therefore the diagnosis of uropathy at risk for recurrence of pyelonephritis, especially high-grade reflux. There are no French recommendations on imaging evaluation after a first episode of pyelonephritis. Voiding cystography was systematically proposed years ago and recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics until 1999. This systematic strategy exposed all children to a painful, irradiating exam, and exposed them to urinary tract infection. The American recommendations changed in 2011 and cystography is now only proposed to children with recurrence of pyelonephritis or with ultrasound abnormalities. A collaborative review of the literature involving the Pediatric Emergency, Nephrology and Surgery Departments at Necker-Enfants-Malades Hospital led us to propose an algorithm for imaging after the first episode of pyelonephritis in children. This algorithm was based on data from the past medical history (results of prenatal ultrasonography or recurrence of pyelonephritis), the results of the ultrasound exam at the time of diagnosis, and the procalcitonin concentration, to limit the indications for voiding cystography, limiting risk for delaying high-grade reflux diagnosis. Children with low risk for high-grade reflux can be followed up with an ultrasound exam 6 months after acute infection."

CD010657,0,11766382,0,[A pediatric case of acute focal bacterial nephritis; comparison with the reports in Japanese child cases].,"We report an 8-year-old boy with acute focal bacterial nephritis (AFBN). At the age of 3 months, he had a history of urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux. He was admitted to our hospital because of high fever and costovertebral angle pain. Although acute pyelonephritis was suspected, neither pyuria nor cultures of blood and urine were positive. An initial ultrasonogram (US) of his kidneys was normal except for bilateral hydronephrosis. Two days later, however, a computed tomography (CT) revealed a poorly enhanced mass in the upper pole of the right kidney. Similar findings were also observed by US. Under the diagnosis of AFBN, he received antibiotics for 3 weeks. Voiding cystourethrogram showed both-sided vesicoureteral reflux and he underwent an operation. At present the mass of the kidney still remains, albeit its size tends to decrease. We suggest that an early examination of US or enhanced CT is necessary in cases with fever of unknown origin, considering the possibility of AFBN even if neither pyuria nor cultures of urine are positive."

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of fluctuating size of the renal pelvis on sonography, particularly in relationship to VUR. We prospectively recorded fetal renal pelvic diameter >/=4 mm in 1,092 fetuses (692 boys), from May 1989 to December 1995, with a minimum follow-up of 7 years. Fluctuation, defined as size of renal pelvis changing by more than 4 mm during the course of obstetric (23), postnatal (128), and both pre- and postnatal (7) renal sonograms, was recorded prospectively in 159 (117 boys). Of the 1,092, 849 (593 boys) had a voiding cystourethrogram at a mean age of 7 weeks (range 3-20 weeks). Of the 31 (16 girls) with high-grade VUR, fluctuation was observed in 20 (9 girls). Fluctuation was strongly associated with high-grade VUR (odds ratio 11.1, P=0.0000003) and with renal damage (sensitivity 61%, positive predictive value 31%). Primary high-grade VUR was persistent, seen equally in boys and girls, and required surgery in the majority. Fluctuation was associated with renal duplication anomalies ( P=0.00009) and megaureter ( P<0.00000001). Fluctuation of the renal pelvis on sonography is a marker for persistent high-grade VUR and renal damage in girls and boys."

Initially the identification of a large number of asymptomatic infants appeared to afford the surgeon the opportunity for preemptive intervention. However, it has now become apparent that antenatal hydronephrosis (AH) is far more difficult to interpret than originally perceived. The initial enthusiasm for surgery has now been replaced by a much more conservative approach to ureteropelvic junction(UPJ) obstruction, multi-cystic dysplastic kidney(MCDK), vesicoureteral reflux and the non-refluxing megaureter. This review will highlight the postnatal evaluation of AH and include an overview of the Society for Fetal Urology grading system for hydronephrosis.

All patients were studied at least 3 months after their most recent urinary tract infection and micturating cystourethrography (MCU) was performed prior to the scintigraphic studies. DMSA scintigraphy detected significantly more cortical abnormalities than did IVU. There was also a correlation between cortical abnormalities in the DMSA studies and the degree of reflux on MCU. The validity of DMSA as a cortical imaging agent is evaluated and the histological evidence for its efficacy derived from the animal model is reviewed, lending weight to its establishment as the ""gold standard"" for renal cortical scarring."

CD010657,0,21566305,1,Accuracy of cystosonography in the diagnosis of vesicourethral reflux in children.,"Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is found in 1% of all children and in 30%-50% of those with urinary tract infection. Furthermore, VUR in childhood is the main reason for pyelonephritis, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Recently, a variety of procedures with low radiation have been recommended for diagnosis of VUR. Therefore, in this study, voiding urosonography (VUS) or cystosonography was performed for evaluation of VUR and for comparing it with radio nucleotide cystography (RNC). We studied 25 children admitted with initial diagnosis of VUR in our center in the year 2007. Simultaneously, RNC and VUS were performed for all the patients. VUR was detected in eight patients with the VUS procedure and in nine children with RNC. Another patient was diagnosed only by RNC, and two other patients by only VUS. The two methods were concordant in detection and exclusion of urinary reflux in 87% (P: 0.000, r: 0.728). Furthermore, the diagnosis of various grades of reflux by these two schemes were comparable (P: 0.0000, r: 0.724). Sensitivity and specifity of VUS was determined as 87% and 88%, respectively, with a 94% positive predictive value and a 77% negative predictive value. We conclude that VUS is a highly accurate, safe and inexpensive tool for the screening, diagnosis and follow-up of VUR."

Routine scanning of the urinary tract was performed; the dynamics of dilatation of the renal pelvis was estimated depending on the degree of the urinary bladder filling and urination; contrast sonography was carried out. Complex ultrasonography was informative in 33% of cases with grade I VUR, in 79% of cases with grade II VUR, and in 100% of cases with grade III-V VUR.

CD010657,0,3909120,1,Identification of children requiring radiologic evaluation for urinary infection.,"Sixty-nine children younger than 13 years of age with urinary tract infection were evaluated to identify risk factors for treatable urologic problems; i.e. those requiring surgery or prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis. All children had a renal ultrasound, intravenous pyelogram and voiding cystogram performed 4 to 6 weeks after the infection. Eleven children with treatable problems were identified, 10 with vesicoureteral reflux and 1 with a ureterocele. For identification of treatable problems the predictive value of a positive test was: (1) fever, 10 of 24 (41.7%); (2) abnormal D-deaminoarginine vasopressin renal concentrating ability, 8 of 24 (33.3%); (3) serum C-reactive protein greater than or equal to 1.0, 8 of 25 (32.0%); (4) Elevated urine N-acetylglucosaminidase, 5 of 16 (31.2%); (5) erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 25, 6 of 21 (28.6%); and (6) age less than 5 years, 10 of 43 (23.3%). Absence of fever denotes a low risk (less than 3%) of finding a treatable problem. Afebrile girls older than 5 years of age can have radiologic evaluation deferred until infection recurs. The presence of fever indicates a high risk of treatable urologic problems (41.7%) and warrants complete radiologic evaluation with the first urinary infection."

In this review, we discuss the need for radiological investigations and the extent of their use as well as the need for prophylactic antibiotics in children with UTI and vesicoureteral reflux. Only a small proportion of children with first UTI and no history of antenatal renal abnormalities have clinically important malformations. Renal ultrasound should be performed in febrile infants and young children with UTI; a micturating cystourethrogram should not be performed routinely after the first febrile UTI. Long-term antibiotics appear to reduce the risk of recurrent symptomatic UTI in susceptible children, although the clinical benefit is marginal. Current recommendations encourage performing radiological investigations only in children at risk and discourage routine prophylactic antibiotic use."

CD010657,0,3438957,0,The evolving uroradiographic evaluation of the lower urinary tract in neonates with myelomeningocele.,"Radiographic cystography (VCUG) has been advocated to detect dynamic and anatomic abnormalities of the lower urinary tract in the neonate with myelomeningocele (MM). We reviewed the VCUG in 120 neonates and the radionuclide cystograms (RNC) or cystometrograms (RNCMG) in 30 neonates to reevaluate the role of cystography in this population. Surgery was not required to treat the anatomic abnormalities detected by VCUG. The absence/presence of reflux and a bladder residual volume of greater than 15 cc were the two most important criteria in determining the neonatal voiding regimen. Because RNC provides this information equally well with a much smaller radiation dose and because of the additional functional information available from RNCMG, we now recommend that RNC or RNCMG be used to evaluate the lower urinary tract of neonates with MM."

CD010657,0,24221606,0,Clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion associated with febrile urinary tract infection.,"Common pathogens of clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) are viruses, such as influenza virus. However, bacteria are rare pathogens for MERS. We report the first patient with MERS associated with febrile urinary tract infection. A 16-year-old lupus patient was admitted to our hospital. She had fever, headache, vomiting, and right back pain. Urinary analysis showed leukocyturia, and urinary culture identified Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cerebrospinal fluid examination and brain single-photon emission computed tomography showed no abnormalities. Therefore, she was diagnosed with febrile urinary tract infection. For further examinations, 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy showed right cortical defects, and a voiding cystourethrogram demonstrated right vesicoureteral reflux (grade II). Therefore, she was diagnosed with right pyelonephritis. Although treatment with antibiotics administered intravenously improved the fever, laboratory findings, and right back pain, she had prolonged headaches, nausea, and vomiting. T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images in brain magnetic resonance imaging showed high intensity lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum, which completely disappeared 1 week later. These results were compatible with MERS. To the best of our knowledge, our patient is the first patient who showed clinical features of MERS associated with febrile urinary tract infection."

CD010657,0,17273861,1,Predictive value of clinical and laboratory variables for vesicoureteral reflux in children.,"We aimed to determine the predictability of clinical and laboratory variables for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children with urinary tract infection (UTI). Data of children with febrile UTI who underwent voiding cystoureterography between 2002 and 2005 were evaluated retrospectively for clinical (age, gender, fever > or = 38.5 degrees C, recurrent UTI), laboratory [leukocytosis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), pyuria, serum creatinine (S(Cr))] and imaging (renal ultrasonography) variables. Children with VUR (group 1) vs. no VUR (group 2) and children with high-grade (III-V) VUR (group 3) vs. no or low-grade (I-II) VUR (group 4) were compared. Among 88 patients (24 male), 38 had VUR and 21 high-grade VUR. Fever > or = 38.5 degrees C was associated with VUR [odds ratio (OR): 7.5]. CRP level of 50 mg/l was the best cut-off level for predicting high-grade VUR (OR 15.5; discriminative ability 0.89 +/- 0.05). Performing voiding cystourethrography based on this CRP level would result in failure to notice 9% of patients with high-grade VUR, whereas 69% of children with no/low-grade VUR would be spared from this invasive test. In conclusion, fever > or = 38 degrees C and CRP > 50 mg/l seem to be potentially useful clinical predictors of VUR and high-grade VUR, respectively, in pediatric patients with UTI. Further validation of these findings could limit unnecessary voiding cystourethrography."
CD010657,0,21678334,0,Interventions for primary vesicoureteric reflux.,Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) results in urine passing retrograde up the ureter.

Management of these children has been directed at preventing UTI by antibiotic prophylaxis and/or surgical correction of VUR. The optimum strategy is not clear.
CD010657,0,11420916,0,Role of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis of culture negative pyelonephritis.,"The aim of this work was to evaluate prospectively the proportion of children with a clinical and biological presentation of acute pyelonephritis, abnormal Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy and negative or equivocal urine cultures. All patients aged 6 weeks to 15 years suspected of acute pyelonephritis (APN) were admitted to the Paediatric Department and underwent Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy within 3 days after admission and at 6 months. Of 166 patients enrolled in the study, 15 (9%) had negative or equivocal urine culture despite clinical and scintigraphic evidence of APN. Of these 15 children, renal ultrasound was normal in 7 patients and vesicoureteric reflux was found in 9 patients. Control DMSA 6 months after acute episode showed the disappearance of cortical lesions in eight and partial improvement in four patients. In this prospective series, as many as 9% of patients with APN would have been missed on the basis of equivocal or negative urine cultures. It is suggested that Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy should be performed in children with severe infection without clear aetiology, especially in those with abnormal urinalysis."
CD010657,0,15838697,0,Neonates with extra-renal pelvis: the first 2 years.,"Extra-renal pelvis (ERpel) is a common ultrasonographic finding among neonates who have undergone recurrent ultrasound examinations for a better definition of prenatal renal pelvic dilatation. This study tries to determine whether or not ERpel has important prognostic implications. Seventy-nine neonates (17 female) were examined. All had a diagnosis of prenatal renal pelvis dilatation, which was shown by postnatal ultrasound to be ERpel. Sixty ERpel neonates were examined 1.5 months to 2.5 months after the ultrasound (US) diagnosis by both Tc-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DPTA) dynamic renal scanning and (99m)Tc-pertechnetate direct cystography. Clinical assessment, urine cultures and renal ultrasound follow-up were maintained for 2 years. The proportion of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients with ERpel was compared with that of the total neonatal and infantile population with normal US scans in the region of our hospital. Associated minor congenital malformations were found in 12 of 79 neonates (15.2%). Four had a family history of ERpel. Among 60 neonates who underwent renal scanning, 36 (60%) were found to have urinary retention in the collecting system. Another nine (15%) had vesico-ureteral (VU) reflux, of which seven had urinary retention. Fifteen (25%) showed normal isotope imaging. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed in 16 ERpel neonates in whom only one exhibited VU reflux (grade 2). The incidence of neonatal UTI in the ERpel group was more than that of either neonatal or infantile UTI in those with normal US scans in the local population (20.2% vs 1.2% and 4.3%, respectively). Fifty-three infants completed a 2-year follow-up. Repeat renal ultrasonography indicated that one infant (1.8%) had developed bilateral hydronephrosis, 12 (22.6%) had unchanged findings, 18 (40%) showed an improvement (decrease of ERpel width or resolution in one side) and, in 22 (41.5%) infants, the condition had resolved. No clinical or kidney function deterioration was observed. Seven patients (13.2%) each had one episode of UTI during the 2-year follow-up period; none of them had VU reflux. Neonatal ERpel is more frequent in male infants. It is associated with greater rates of minor congenital malformations, VU reflux and UTI than in the general population of the same ages. The increased UTI incidence is not attributed to VU reflux."

CD010657,0,21126919,0,The accuracy and health risks of a voiding cystourethrogram after a febrile urinary tract infection.,Physicians often defer obtaining a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) after the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) due to concerns regarding increased health risks and inflated rates of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). This study examines the health risks and accuracy of VCUG testing after diagnosis of a febrile UTI.
CD010657,0,11057550,0,Long-term results of treatment of single-system ectopic ureters.,"Single-system ureteral ectopia (UE) encompasses a spectrum of malformations involving the bladder trigone, ureter, and kidney. The clinical presentation is variable, and both diagnostic and therapeutic problems are common. Reduced renal function in these patients may result from primary dysplasia, obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, or recurrent infection. Based on our experience of seven patients, suggestions for diagnostic procedures and criteria for renal saving versus nephrectomy are offered. The relationship between ostium localization, renal function, and long-term results was investigated. From 1972 to 1990, five female and two male patients were studied. During the same period, 31 patients with UE and duplex kidneys were seen. Ages ranged from 1 day to 7 years. A ureteric opening into the bladder neck was associated with dilatation of the ureter and renal pelvis. Two patients had vaginal ectopia and severe renal dysplasia. In one, a cyst of the vaginal wall (Gardner's cyst) was detected at birth. A male newborn had multicystic renal dysplasia on the left and ureteric ectopia to the ductus deferens on the right side. To our knowledge, he is the first patient reported with renal function totally dependent on a kidney with severe UE. Follow-up ranged from 4 to 9 years. One patient died in the postoperative period because of renal failure and sepsis. All the others are well and have normal creatinine values. Improvement of renal function was noted after ureteral reimplantation (URI) in patients with bladder-neck ectopia. The numbers of infections were also drastically reduced. Our observations suggest that the combination of ultrasound, cyst urethrography, and cystoscopy will be diagnostic in most patients. A suspicion of UE should be raised in symptomatic patients with apparently solitary kidneys, enuresis ureterica, or atypical obstructive uropathy. Reduced renal function in some patients with ectopia to the bladder neck will improve after URI. This may be of importance in patients with bilateral anomalies and marginal renal function."

CD010657,0,16356794,0,Pediatric applications of renal nuclear medicine.,"This review should be regarded as an opinion based on personal experience, clinical and experimental studies, and many discussions with colleagues. It covers the main radionuclide procedures for nephro-urological diseases in children. Glomerular filtration rate can be accurately determined using simplified 2- or 1-blood sample plasma clearance methods. Minor controversies related to the technical aspects of these methods concern principally some correction factors, the quality control, and the normal values in children. However, the main problem is the reluctance of the clinician to apply these methods, despite the accuracy and precision that are higher than with the traditional chemical methods. Interesting indications are early detection of renal impairment, hyperfiltration status, and monitoring of nephrotoxic drugs. Cortical scintigraphy is accepted as a highly sensitive technique for the detection of regional lesions. It accurately reflects the histological changes, and the interobserver reproducibility in reporting is high. Potential technical pitfalls should be recognized, such as the normal variants and the difficulty in differentiating acute lesions from permanent ones or acquired lesions from congenital ones. Although dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy seems to play a minor role in the traditional approach to urinary tract infection, recent studies suggest that this examination might influence the treatment of the acute phase, the indication for chemoprophylaxis and micturating cystography, and the duration of follow-up. New technical developments have been applied recently to the renogram: tracers more appropriate to the young child, early injection of furosemide, late postmicturition and gravity-assisted images and, finally, more objective parameters of renal drainage. Pitfalls mainly are related to the interpretation of drainage on images and curves. Dilated uropathies represent the main indication of the renogram, but the impact of this technique on the management of the child is, in a great number of cases, still a matter of intense controversy. Direct and indirect radionuclide cystography are interesting alternatives to the radiograph technique and should be integrated into the process of diagnosis and follow-up of vesicoureteral reflux."

CD010657,0,8378794,0,Scintigraphic evaluation of pediatric urinary tract infection.,"Scintigraphic evaluation of urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, and renal scarring represents a significant portion of a clinical pediatric nuclear medicine practice. Renal scarring from recurring infection remains an important cause of end-stage renal disease and hypertension in the pediatric population. However, the clinical presentation in infants and young children is often elusive, and clinical diagnosis of upper tract involvement is frequently unreliable. As a result, diagnostic imaging has a critical role to play in the localization of infection to the lower or upper urinary tract. Radionuclide cystography and renal cortical imaging have become mainstays of this evaluation. Direct radionuclide cystography is the preferred cystographic screening technique, because it has lower radiation exposure and greater sensitivity for the detection of vesicoureteral reflux than either indirect radionuclide cystography or fluoroscopic contrast cystography. Renal cortical scintigraphy has become the standard for the detection of pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Correlation with histopathology has demonstrated a high degree of diagnostic accuracy. Acute pyelonephritis has been shown to be the necessary etiologic factor for the development of subsequent renal scarring, and the mechanism of renal injury in pyelonephritis has been extensively studied in experimental models. The ability of prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy to dramatically reduce the incidence of subsequent scarring also has been conclusively demonstrated both clinically and in the experimental model. Vesicoureteral reflux was once thought to be a necessary prerequisite for the development of renal scarring. Although it is clear that the intrarenal reflux of infected urine will create pyelonephritis in the experimental model, the high incidence of pyelonephritis and subsequent scarring in the absence of demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux leaves the role of reflux in question. Although the role of vesicoureteral reflux is incompletely understood, its detection nevertheless remains a standard part of the patient's evaluation."
CD010657,0,12898375,0,Cyclic voiding urosonography in detecting vesicoureteral reflux in children.,"Three methods are currently used to identify vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children, namely X-ray voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), radionuclide voiding cystography (RVC), and, recently, echo-enhanced voiding urosonography (VUS). It is known that the sensitivity of VCUG and RVC for detecting VUR can be improved by using cyclic procedures, such as repeated bladder filling and voiding. The purpose of our prospective study was to evaluate whether the cyclic procedure is superior to the conventional (one cycle only) procedure in VUS also. VUS was performed in 49 patients, aged 1.4-15.8 years (mean 4.1 years). After the first micturition, the catheter was left in place and the whole procedure was repeated under the same conditions. The results of the first and second cycles and the combined procedure were compared. In the initial cycle, 7 of 35 (20%) refluxing renal units that were detected in the second cycle and 4 of 26 (15%) children with at least unilateral VUR were missed. Cyclic VUS detected 25% more VURs than the conventional (one cycle only) VUS ( P=0.049) and revealed 50% more VUR III than the first cycle. Our results suggest that cyclic VUS is superior to conventional VUS."

We prospectively studied 29 patients with a diagnosis of multicystic renal dysplasia by voiding cystourethrography to determine the condition of the solitary contralateral kidney. Eight patients (28%) were found to have contralateral vesicoureteral reflux, of whom 6 had normal ultrasound examinations and would not have undergone further radiographic study based on ultrasound criteria alone. Contralateral vesicoureteral reflux in association with multicystic renal dysplasia puts solitary kidneys at risk for pyelonephritic scarring.

Hydronephrosis secondary to fetal vesicoureteral reflux cannot be differentiated on ultrasound examination from that resulting from lower obstructive uropathy with or without reflux. As renal damage from vesicoureteral reflux may occur in up to 70% of cases, early identification and possible in utero treatment of these fetuses may be warranted.

Medical records of 51 cases of URA followed at Şanlıurfa Children 's Hospital between January 2009 and December 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. In all patients, diagnosis was made by abdominal ultrasound (US) and confirmed by a radionuclide scan. The children were between 3 months and 17 years of age (median age: 5 years). There were 31 males (60.8%) and 20 females (39.2%). In 33 patients (67.3%), the left kidney was absent. Urological anomalies were found in 12/51 patients (23.5%), including ureterovesical junction obstruction in 4 (7.8%), bladder dysfunction in 2 (3.9%), and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), ureteropelvic junction obstruction, ureterovesical and ureteropelvic junction obstruction, duplicated collecting system plus grade IV VUR, ectopic kidney plus grade V VUR, and ectopic kidney in 1 patient (2%) each.

CD010657,0,8741315,1,Ultrasonography for the detection of ureteric reflux in infants with urinary infection.,"Several less harmful methods than voiding cysto-urethrography for detecting significant ureteric reflux have been proposed. The present prospective study investigated whether ultrasonography was effective in identifying ureteric reflux in infants with their first febrile urinary infection. The subjects were 27 infants (24 boys and 3 girls) aged from 0 to 8 months. The urinary tract was scanned when the bladder was full, and before and during induced voiding. Infants with abnormal ultrasound findings underwent voiding cysto-urethrography. The other infants were followed and those who had a recurrence of urinary infection underwent voiding cystography. Ten children underwent cysto-urethrography, with eight refluxing ureters identified in six boys. Ultrasound revealed transient dilatation of the renal pelvis on voiding in five kidneys, transient dilatation of distal ureters in 12 and hydro-ureteronephrosis in two. Each of the five kidneys with pelvic dilatation on voiding was associated with ureteric reflux grades III or IV. Of the 17 children who did not undergo cysto-urethrography, only one had recurrence of urinary infection and was diagnosed with ureteric reflux. This girl was one of the three babies who were not scanned during voiding. More than half of the infants with febrile urinary infection were excluded from invasive examination without having recurrence of urinary infection. Thus, ultrasound scanning during voiding was effective for screening infants with their first urinary infection to detect significant ureteric reflux."

This study allowed a comparison of indirect radionuclide cystography (IRC) and MCUG in 65 children. Renal reflux was detected by IRC in 32% of renal units, while VUR was seen in 36% by MCUG. When a comparison was made with MCUG, IRC had a sensitivity of 74.1% and a specificity of 90.5%. The markedly reduced radiation dose, avoidance of a bladder catheter plus the ability to monitor the urinary tract constantly during the entire procedure should ensure that IRC is the examination of choice in follow-up studies for VUR in all toilet-trained children."

The main objective in investigating children with UTI is to prevent the long-term complications of developing hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or pregnancy complications. However, the prognosis for childhood UTI remains good, with low long-term risks, from epidemiological studies, of developing these sequelae. Although childhood UTI is common, the occurrence of CKD and the likelihood that acute pyelonephritis will cause renal damage progressing to CKD are rare. We studied the current literature on investigations of childhood UTI and propose a protocol for carrying out selected investigations in high-risk children. By identifying this group of children with increased risk of having an abnormal urinary tract that warrant investigation, we recommend that targeting investigations to specific children (as opposed to protocol-based investigations of all children with UTI), will be clinically safe and effective and will avoid the unnecessary distress and cost of invasive investigations."

We sought to determine whether changing the cut-off level of fetal renal pelvic diameter from 10 mm to 4 mm would improve the yield of VUR. In a prospective community-based study, a fetal renal pelvic diameter of 4 mm or more on a transverse view of the fetal renal hilum at obstetric sonography after 16 weeks' gestation was found in 426 fetuses from 9,800 consecutive pregnancies. After birth, renal sonography was performed on 386 of the 426 babies. Of the 386 babies, 264 (187 boys) had a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) at a mean age of 9 weeks. Primary VUR was detected in 33 (16 boys) of the 264 infants (13%), and secondary VUR in another 5 (2%). Only 5 of the 33 (15%) babies with primary VUR would have been detected if a cut-off point of 10 mm for fetal renal pelvic diameter had been used. The prevalence of reflux was similar at each cut-off level of antenatal renal pelvic diameter from 4 to 10 mm. Neither calyceal nor ureteric dilatation was helpful in differentiating those with from those without VUR. The postnatal renal sonogram did not distinguish whether reflux was present or not. More infants with primary VUR, particularly girls, were found by changing the cut-off point for fetal renal pelvic diameter from 10 mm to 4 mm, and performing a VCUG on all such infants even if the postnatal renal sonogram was normal. Of the 33 infants with primary VUR, 9 (27%, 5 boys) had an abnormal dimercaptosuccinic acid scan.

CD010657,0,7618903,0,Long-term follow up to determine the prognostic value of imaging after urinary tract infections. Part 2: Scarring.,"Long term follow up of children with urinary tract infections, in whom imaging investigations were performed at presentation, has been used to identify features that distinguish those at greatest risk of progressive renal damage. No single investigation at presentation was able to predict subsequent deterioration but, by employing a combination of imaging investigations, it was possible to separate groups with high or low probability of progressive damage. In the low risk group the incidence of progressive damage was 0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0 to 1.3%). The combination of both scarring and reflux at presentation, or one only of these but accompanied by subsequent documented urinary tract infection, was associated with a 17-fold (95% CI 2.5 to 118) increase in the relative risk of progressive renal damage compared with children without these features. The recommended combination of investigations at presentation for girls of any age and boys over 1 year is ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in all, to detect both scarring and significant structural abnormalities, renography in children with dilatation of any part of the urinary tract on ultrasound, to distinguish dilatation from obstruction, and an isotope voiding study in all who have acquired bladder control. This gives the best separation between those at high and those at low risk of progressive damage with least radiation dose and lowest rate of instrumentation. Micturating cystourethrography (MCU) should be restricted to girls who have not acquired bladder control, unless there is reason to suspect a significant structural abnormality such as urethral valves. A single non-febrile urinary tract infection that responds promptly to treatment is not a justification for performing MCU in boys under 1 year or in children of any age with bladder control. No case can be made for any abbreviated schedule of investigation. These risk factors should be taken into account when designing follow up protocols."

In the case of a 5 year old girl with recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, VCG showed no ureteral reflux. Urodynamic study revealed a large bladder capacity and significant residual urine. Renal scintigram delineated a right renal scar. Simple ultrasound examination with videotape recording during voiding definitely demonstrated the presence of significant ureteral reflux when she voided, that is, there was marked dilatation of the right distal ureter and ballooning of the right renal pelvis on voiding, and quick refilling of the bladder concomitantly with the disappearance of the pelvic ballooning.

CD010657,0,21868595,0,Economic and radiation costs of initial imaging approaches after a child's first febrile urinary tract infection.,"BACKGROUND. The traditional initial imaging approach following pediatric urinary tract infection is the ""bottom-up"" approach (cystogram and renal ultrasound). Recently, the ""top-down"" approach (nuclear renal scan followed by cystogram for abnormal scans only) has gained increasing attention. The relative cost and radiation doses of these are unknown METHODS. The authors used a decision model to evaluate these imaging approaches. Cost and effective radiation dose estimates, including sensitivity analyses, were based on one-time imaging only. RESULTS. Comparing hypothetical cohorts of 100 000 children, the top-down imaging approach cost $82.9 million versus $59.2 million for the bottom-up approach. Per-capita effective radiation dose was 0.72 mSv for top-down compared with 0.06 mSv for bottom-up. CONCLUSIONS. Routine use of nuclear renal scans in children following initial urinary tract infection diagnosis would result in increased imaging costs and radiation doses as compared to initial cystogram and ultrasound. Further data are required to clarify the long-term clinical implications of this increase."

Prenatal ultrasound showed increased renal parenchymal echogenicity bilaterally with preservation of the medullary pyramid architecture. These children were followed for up to 3 years to determine potential changes in the sonographic appearance of the echogenic renal parenchyma and to assess renal function. In 3 years 8 cases of bilateral hyperechoic fetal kidneys were identified. During postnatal followup renal echogenicity resolved in 4 cases, diminished in 1 and remained the same in 3. The serum creatinine and electrolytes were normal in all cases followed for more than 3 months. Other renal findings included vesicoureteral reflux in 2 of 7 cases, mild pelvic ectasia in 1 and tiny medullary calcifications in 1. The specific etiology of increased echogenicity is unknown, although 1 infant appeared to have a form of autosomal recessive disease with liver hyperechogenicity as well. We conclude that fetuses with bilateral hyperechoic kidneys associated with normal amniotic fluid volume have a favorable outcome. Ultrasonographic finding of marked parenchymal hyperechogenicity appears to improve with time; in our experience renal function is normal and the infants thrive. Continued followup is necessary to determine the long-term natural history of this phenomenon, as is subsequent prenatal and postnatal evaluation of future siblings to assess genetic risk."

The significance of possible effects determines the necessity of early diagnosis of urinary tract pathology. The aim of the paper was to evaluate the morphology and function of kidneys with VUR using selected radioisotope techniques, and to compare the sensitivity of planar technique and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) technique in detection of renal scarring. In 45 children with VUR the following test were performed: ultrasonography, renoscintigraphy with technetium-99m-ethylenedicysteine (EC-Tc-99m) and technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-Tc-99m) scintigraphy with planar and SPECT mode. Stage of VUR correlates with stage of cortical lesions estimated as a value of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) in kidney, as well as scarring intensity in static scintigraphy. The use of SPECT increases sensitivity of examination for detection small, single scars. It seems that SPECT should be used more frequently in children in the group of scarring risk. That would allow for earlier diagnosis of renal scarring, enabling efficient treatment. Due to the correlation between ERPF and parameters obtained in DMSA scintigraphy, renoscintigraphy with EC-Tc-99m may be applied to monitor the progress of renal scarring."
CD010657,0,9326956,0,"Urinary tract infections in children. Epidemiology, evaluation, and management.","Accurate documentation of UTIs in children is essential for proper evaluation and management. Urine cultures with multiple organisms or colony counts less than 50,000 to 100,000 CFU/ml should be considered suspect and require confirmation, particularly with clean-catch specimens. Children with well-documented UTIs should be evaluated based on their age and presenting symptoms. Infants and young children require imaging, usually with a cystogram and sonogram of the kidneys and bladder. Older girls with febrile UTIs and boys at any age should also be considered for urinary tract imaging. Renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA has emerged as the imaging study of choice for acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring in children with UTIs. Treatment of UTIs in children ideally commences with culture-specific antimicrobial therapy, although treatment may be started in sick children before culture results are available. Short-course treatment (3-5 days) is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower UTIs. Children with acute pyelonephritis require 10 to 14 days of antibiotics, which can be administered on an outpatient basis in older infants and children who are not toxic, as long as good compliance is expected. Patients with first-time UTIs who require imaging should be maintained on low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis until their workup is completed. Treatment of ABU does not seem necessary if the urinary tract is otherwise normal. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for children with frequent symptomatic recurrences of UTI and for those with known VUR. Diagnosis and treatment of underlying voiding dysfunction and constipation is an essential component of the successful management of UTIs in children."
CD010657,0,11793131,1,Age-related radiological imaging in children with acute pyelonephritis.,"Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) using clinical and laboratory parameters is often difficult in children. The aims of this retrospective study were twofold. Firstly, to correlate the clinical and laboratory manifestations of APN with the results of the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in different age groups. Secondly, to compare the DMSA renal scan, renal ultrasonography (RUS), and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in patients with clinical APN. The DMSA renal scan was utilized as the gold standard for renal involvement. We determined the sensitivity of these tests in febrile urinary tract infections (UTI) in three age groups: group I less than 2 years; group II 2-8 years; group III older than 8 years. During the period January 1992 through December 1998, 222 children presented with a febrile UTI. All patients had a DMSA renal scan, 208 had contrast VCUG, and 163 had RUS. The clinical and laboratory manifestation of pyelonephritis correlated better with a positive DMSA renal scan in the older children than in the younger children; 85% of the DMSA renal scans were positive in group III; 69% in group II; 48% in group I (P<0.001). Vesicoureteral reflux detected by contrast VCUG was more prevalent in the younger age groups. Although high grades of reflux (grade IV-V) correlated better with a positive DMSA renal scan, it did not reach a level of statistical significance (P>0.05). RUS did not correlate with a positive DMSA renal scan in any age group."
CD010657,0,11793136,0,Diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux with ultrasonography.,"The primary diagnostic procedure for evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children is fluoroscopic voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). Radionuclide cystography (RNC) is an alternative, sensitive method for diagnosing VUR, but it lacks spatial resolution. Over the past 2 decades, in an effort to eliminate the radiation exposure intrinsic to these methods, many endeavors had been made to use ultrasonography (US) for the diagnosis of VUR. The various attempts that have been undertaken are reviewed. The real breakthrough in the US diagnostic option has come with the availability of stable US contrast media that can be administered intravesically. Comparison between contrast-enhanced sonographic reflux examination (voiding urosonography, VUS) and VCUG/RNC has revealed the high concordance between these imaging modalities regarding the diagnosis or exclusion of VUR. Imaging of the urethra still necessitates the performance of VCUG. VUS is used in routine imaging primarily for follow-up cases, girls, and screening high-risk groups for reflux. Using these selection criteria, the number of VCUG investigations can be reduced by over half and, consequently, a significant reduction of radiation exposure in children can be achieved. With the emergence of harmonic US imaging, the sonographic reflux examination will gain further diagnostic potential and widespread application. The whole field of sonographic diagnosis of reflux is still in the process of rapid development."

CD010657,0,24270100,0,Voiding cystourethrography is mandatory in infants with febrile urinary tract infection.,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is common condition in infants with febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs). Both VUR and febrile UTIs are risk factors for renal scars, characterized by glomerular hypertrophy with global or segmental sclerosis as cardinal features in pathology. Because renal scars may cause hypertension or chronic kidney diseases in later life, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) has been mandatory for infants following their first febrile UTIs to identify VUR. However, increasing evidence suggests that the presence of VUR may not represent a direct risk factor for renal scars, which has led to an increase in the use of a stratified approach, in which VCUG is not performed for all patients. This study was conducted to verify whether the stratified approach is justified to identify infants at risk for renal scarring. The medical records of 306 infants with first febrile UTIs (median age, 4 months; 0-72 months) were reviewed. VUR was detected in 40.4% (67/166) of patients by the non-stratified approach, in which VCUG was performed in all patients. In contrast, VUR was identified in only 27.1% (38/140) of patients by the stratified approach, in which VCUG was performed only in the patients with high risk of developing renal scars. This difference in the discovery rate was significant (p = 0.02). Renal bladder ultrasonography had the sensitivities of as low as 45.7% and 52.9% in detecting VUR and in predicting renal scarring assessed by renal scintigraphy, respectively. In conclusion, VCUG should be performed in all infants after their first febrile UTIs."

Urinary tract infection is the most common serious bacterial infection in children. The aim of this study was to compare the value of different laboratory and imaging techniques in detecting renal involvement in acute pyelonephritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In a cross-sectional study of patients 1 month to 14 years of age diagnosed with urinary tract infection were examined with systemic inflammatory markers, renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy. A total of 1467 pediatric patients were eligible for treatment of pyelonephritis. Evaluations included a complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urinalysis, urine culture, and measurement of serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. RESULTS. The results of (99m)Tc-DMSA scans were normal in 20.2%, mild decreased cortical uptake in 45.0%, moderate decreased cortical uptake in 12.3%, severe decreased cortical uptake in 12.0%, and decreased cortical function plus irregularity or scar formation in 10.5%. Voiding cystourethrography showed vesicoureteral reflux in 25.9%. The sensitivity of (99m)Tc-DMSA for prediction of vesicoureteral reflux was 84.1% with a negative predictive value of 80.6%. Significant differences were found in the level of blood leukocyte count (P = .03), urine leukocyte count (P = .003), ESR (P = .008), and age (P = .04) between patients with normal and abnormal (99m)Tc-DMSA scan results. CONCLUSIONS. We found that in patient with clinical signs of pyelonephritis, (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy can detect pyelonephritis more accurately than the other inflammatory and imaging tests."

Work in progress.,"Unlike gray-scale sonography, color Doppler ultrasonography allows reliable visualization of the ureteric jet phenomenon. A study was undertaken to determine whether any measurable parameter predicts the presence of vesicoureteric reflux. Measurements of mean urine jet velocity, longitudinal angle, transverse angle, and distance of the origin of the jet from the midline of the bladder were obtained on 31 infants and children (62 ureters) with a proved urinary tract infection. Of these measurements, only the distance of the ureteric orifice from the midline of the bladder was found to correlate with vesicoureteric reflux (mean distance in the reflux group, 10.25 mm +/- 2.40 (standard deviation [SD]); in the nonreflux group, 7.98 mm +/- 2.40 [P = .004]). The authors conclude that the more laterally positioned the ureteric orifice, the more likely it is to reflux. Color Doppler ultrasound measurement of the laterality of the ureteric orifice may be useful for predicting which children with a urinary tract infection would benefit from voiding cystourethrography."

This prospective study had three aims: (1) to evaluate the medium-term evolution of the scintigraphic abnormalities, to find a prognostic criterion of scintigraphic evolution; (2) to assess the correlation between the severity of early or late scintigraphic damage and selected clinical factors; and (3) to compare the permanent scintigraphic renal scars with intravenous urography (IVU) 2 years after the acute infection. Seventy-four children (mean age 32 months), presenting with a first clinical episode of pyelonephritis and an initial scintigraphic abnormality, were included in the study. Patients with a history of urinary tract infection (UTI), uropathy other than vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) and a relapse of acute pyelonephritis were excluded. All children underwent control scintigraphy (mean 9 months after APN) and 43 had an IVU (mean 26 months after APN). Fifty-seven children (77%) still have scintigraphic abnormalities of varying severity (7 atrophic kidneys). Initial relative DMSA uptake of less than 45% results in a worse scintigraphic prognosis. The age of the child has no bearing on the severity of the initial renal involvement or on the evolution of the scintigraphic abnormalities. The rapid introduction of antibiotics (< 12 h) significantly improves the scintigraphic prognosis (P < 0.01). The presence of reflux (n = 39) leads to more serious initial damage, but we did not find any effect on later evolution in this study, in which all reflux was low grade in nature. Among the 43 children who had an IVU, 5 showed typical urographic and scintigraphic renal scars in the corresponding region and 38 showed a normal IVU with 28 cases of scintigraphic abnormalities. A DMSA scan is more sensitive than IVU for the detection of renal scarring after a first episode of APN."

Atypical UTI was defined as in the NICE UTI guideline. Overall, 576 boys and 244 girls aged below 24 months were reviewed. All underwent ultrasound (US) and micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) and 612 underwent DMSA scans. US was abnormal in 73 (8.9%) and vesicoureteral reflux was shown in 195 patients (23.8%). A total of 126 patients were considered to have remediable urological abnormalities requiring additional surgical or medical interventions. The NICE guideline yielded excellent negative predictive values (NPV) of 100-94.4% in girls but 91% in boys. If all boys underwent US and DMSA and only those with atypical UTI or abnormal US or DMSA proceeded to MCUG, then the NPV increased to 95.2% and 97.4% for boys aged below and above 6 months, respectively.

Terminal renal insufficiency was seen in one, CRI in five patients and in three patients the kidney function could be maintained, but they all had severe scarring of at least one kidney. Furthermore, all revealed a dilation of the bladder and the upper urinary tract. Vesicoureteral reflux occurred in six and obstruction of the ureterovesical junction in three patients. Two girls underwent repeated reflux surgery resulting in a rapid deterioration of renal function. Three patients developed hypertension and one had a hypertensive crisis with microangiopathic anaemia and acute renal failure. Psychogenic disorders and problematic family settings were observed in all cases.

According to their position, ureteroceles are divided into intravesical, when the ureterocele is completely contained inside the bladder, and extravesical when part of the cyst extends to the urethra or bladder neck. Most ureteroceles are diagnosed in utero or immediately after birth during an echographic screening of renal malformations. Severe, febrile urinary tract infection is the most common postnatal presentation of ureteroceles, but they may, rarely, prolapse and acutely obstruct the bladder outlet. Once an ureterocele is identified sonographically, a voiding cystourethrogram to detect vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and a 99m-technetium dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan to evaluate the function of the different portions of the kidney are mandatory. VUR in the lower pole is observed in 50% of cases and in the contralateral kidney in 25%. Simple endoscopic puncture of the ureterocele has recently been advocated as an emergency therapy for infected or obstructing ureteroceles and as an elective therapy for intravesical ureteroceles. The rate of additional surgery after elective endoscopic puncture of an orthotopic ureterocele ranges from 7 to 23%. Treatment of ectopic ureteroceles is more challenging and both endoscopic puncture and upper pole partial nephrectomy frequently require additional surgery at the bladder level. The reoperation rate after endoscopic treatment varies from 48 to 100%. It is 15 to 20% after upper pole partial nephrectomy if VUR was absent before the operation, but is as high as 50-100% when VUR was present. Thus, endoscopic incision is appropriate as an emergency treatment or when dealing with a completely intravesical ureterocele. Upper pole partial nephrectomy is the elective treatment for an ectopic ureterocele without preoperative VUR. In an ectopic ureterocele with VUR, no matter which type of primary therapy has been chosen, a secondary procedure at the bladder level, involving ureterocele removal and reimplantation of the ureter(s), should be anticipated."
CD010657,0,8299237,0,Reflux nephropathy in children submitted to unilateral nephrectomy: a clinicopathological study.,"The clinical findings and renal histopathology have been reviewed in children with gross primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) submitted to unilateral nephrectomy. Of the 42 children reviewed, sections of the nephrectomy specimens were available in 36. In this series, 34 patients were male and eight were female. The boys included seven in which hydronephrosis was identified by fetal ultrasound. The male patients tended to present earlier and had nephrectomies younger than the females. Segmental scarring was frequent in both males and females, but evidence of dysplastic renal development was confined to the male patients and occurred in the majority (63%). Acquired mechanisms for the induction of segmental renal scarring, involving VUR, intrarenal reflux (IRR) and urinary infection, shown to be important in older children, clearly operate in infancy. However, this study emphasizes that congenital malformation of the kidney is a crucial factor in the development of reflux nephropathy (RN) in this younger age group, particularly in males. Speculation on the significance of the association between renal dysplasia and RN is discussed in relation to observations on the embryological development of the male lower urinary tract."

However, the incidence of congenitally small kidneys and the frequency of its association with ureteral reflux remains unknown. Ultrasound scanning, performed in 4,000 apparently healthy neonates or young infants (males 2,129, females 1,871), detected 51 children suspected of having small kidneys. A careful ultrasound re-examination performed one month later in 45 of the 51 children confirmed small kidneys in eight children, one bilateral and seven unilateral. Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) renoscintigraphy revealed small kidneys with generally diminished uptake in six infants and no uptake unilaterally in the other two infants. One of the 12 children, who had normal findings on the initial scanning and subsequently developed urinary infection, was later diagnosed having unilateral small kidney with generally reduced DMSA uptake. All seven infants having small kidneys with reduced tracer uptake were male (incidence, 1:300 boys). All eight small kidneys in the seven boys and four of the six contralateral non-small kidneys were associated with ureteral reflux, while neither of the two infants with a non-functioning kidney had ureteral reflux. Serial ultrasounds documented the poor growth of all small kidneys. Thus, congenitally small kidneys with generally diminished DMSA uptake were highly associated with ureteral reflux and especially observed in boys."

These included both symptomatic and asymptomatic siblings. The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux in asymptomatic siblings, however, has not been studied extensively. Sixty asymptomatic siblings of patients known to have vesicoureteral reflux were studied with radionuclide voiding cystography. Their ages ranged from 2 months to 15 years (mean, 4.2 years). Vesicoureteral reflux was detected in 27 of 60 (45%) of the siblings. Vesicoureteral reflux was unilateral in 15 and bilateral in 12 of the siblings. Radionuclide cystography is more sensitive than radiographic cystography and results in a very low radiation dose to the patient. The gonadal dose with radionuclide cystography is only 1.0 to 2.0 mrads. Because of these features, radionuclide cystography is a nearly ideal technique for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in siblings of patients with known vesicoureteral reflux. All siblings (symptomatic or asymptomatic) of patients with known vesicoureteral reflux should have a screening radionuclide cystography."

CD010657,0,9035208,0,Detection of low-grade vesicoureteral reflux in children by color Doppler imaging mode.,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is common in children with urinary tract infections (UTI) and may result in renal scarring or reflux nephropathy. To date, the primary diagnostic tool has been voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). A new technique for evaluation of grade 1 and 2 VUR is described using color Doppler imaging-mode cystography (CDIMC): 77 children, aged 7 months to 14 years, were examined for VUR by CDIMC and standard VCUG. According to the established reflux sonography (US) using a real-time mode, all patients selected for this study had a normal urinary tract on conventional gray-scale US. We studied 154 ureters, and a total of 31 were found to be refluxing on CDIMC and 30 on VCUG. A positive sonogram was defined as visualization of Doppler signals from the bladder to the ureter during the course of bladder filling. Taking VCUG as the gold standard, we had ten false-positive findings. The false-positive rate of 18.5% may have been due to the shorter observation time of fluoroscopy. Comparison of the two methods shows CDIMC to be 70% sensitive with a specificity of 92% in the detection of VUR grade 1 and 2. To evaluate the incidence of asymptomatic low-grade VUR in a non-infected population, a second series of 38 children (19 males, 19 females) aged 3 to 15 years (mean 8.8 years) with normal urologic status and urine cultures were studied by color Doppler imaging mode (CDIM) for detection of asymptomatic low-grade VUR. Four children were found to have a unilateral refluxing ureter. The incidence of VUR in children with a normal urinary tract and no prior UTI was 10.5%. In conclusion, CDIMC can be used as a possible alternative to standard VCUG for the screening and follow-up of low-grade VUR. In addition, our study indicates that asymptomatic grade 1 and 2 reflux might be a physiological condition."
CD010657,0,9035209,0,Ureteroceles in children: an ongoing challenge.,"The treatment of ureteroceles in children requires an individualised approach. Antenatal diagnosis is the ideal, so that postnatal urinary antibiotic prophylaxis and appropriate investigations can be organised. Postnatal investigations should assess both upper and lower urinary tract. Renal and bladder ultrasound and radiographic micturating cystourethragraphy under antibiotic cover will both detect vesicoureteric reflux and assess any bladder outlet obstruction due to the ureterocele. Renal function, particularly of the upper moiety, is best evaluated by technetium Tc99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan. Both function and obstruction can be quantitated by the Tc99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine isotope scan with intravenous volume expansion (10 ml/kg) and furosemide diuresis (1 mg/kg). Intravenous urography provides the best anatomic information when the upper moiety is functional. The surgical management is based on the clinical situation, which is often variable, and therefore needs to be tailored for each patient. The general principles include restoration of anatomy to as near normal as possible and preservation of functional renal tissue."

Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy is an accurate method for evaluation of regional cortical impairment during acute pyelonephritis and later on, for detection of permanent scarring. Tc-99m MAG3 renography is nowadays a well-standardized method for accurate estimation of the split renal function and of renal drainage with or without furosemide challenge.

Children with DS may have an increased risk for developing posterior urethral valves and obstructive uropathy. Furthermore, they may also develop chronic renal failure secondary to posterior urethral valves. Therefore, we suggests that infants with DS be screened with ultrasonography for renal and urological abnormalities early in life and, if abnormal, a contrast voiding cystourethrogram be performed to rule out posterior urethral valves or other bladder or urethral abnormalities. A review of the renal and urological anomalies in DS reported in the literature since 1960 is presented."

Wide variations of urinary THP excretion and GFR were seen in all grades of VUR. On the basis of the relationship between urinary THP excretion and GFR before the surgery, patients were divided into three groups. The first group (group A, n = 8) had normal urinary THP values and normal values of GFR. The second group (group B, n = 11) had high THP excretion and moderately decreased GFR, the third group (group C, n = 7) had normal urinary THP excretion and severely decreased GFR. In group A, urinary THP values remained normal and GFR improved in all patients after surgery. In group B, GFR improved when urinary THP dropped immediately, but GFR did not improve when urinary THP remained high after surgery. In group C, GFR did not improve and urinary THP continued to be low or tended to drop again after the surgery. The results suggested that serial measurements of urinary THP excretion and GFR by 99mTc-DTPA renal scintigraphy before and after antireflux surgery are useful for the evaluation of renal function in patients with primary VUR."

There were 63 males and 26 females; ages ranged from neonates to 14 years. UTI was diagnosed on the basis of a positive urine culture, VUR was diagnosed and graded by micturating cystourethrogram (MCU), and renal scarring was assessed by technetium 99 m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Ultrasonography (US) was done to evaluate renal tract dilatation and other structural abnormalities. A follow up DMSA scan was performed approximately 6 months after the initial scan. VUR was present in 106 of the 171 renal units in which it was studied and absent in 65 units. The majority of the VUR was grade V. Renal scars were seen in 90 of 177 renal units at presentation and in 72 of the 163 renal units studied at follow-up. Some information was lacking in 31 patients; hence, the correlation between UTI, VUR, and renal scarring was done in 58 patients. The majority of the suspected scars at presentation were not seen at follow-up, but most of the established scars persisted. Only 2 renal units showed scars for the first time on follow-up. On US, approximately 50% of normal kidneys showed either suspicious or established scars on DMSA scan, and patients with bilateral abnormality on US showed renal scars. Renal scars were seen in 15 of 23 children without VUR, 17 of 18 with unilateral VUR, and 16 of 17 with bilateral VUR. Thus, there is a cause-and-effect relationship between UTI and renal scarring that is made worse by VUR. DMSA scans have been shown to be the most reliable method of assessing renal scarring, and an abnormal US scan showing upper-tract dilatation or a structural abnormality may have a predictive value in the detection of renal scarring."
CD010657,0,11956779,0,Color Doppler ultrasonography in the assessment of vesicoureteric reflux in children with bladder dysfunction.,"To determine whether color Doppler ultrasound (DUS) evaluation of ureteric jets could predict vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children with non-neuropathic and neuropathic bladder/sphincter dysfunction, 129 children were evaluated to identify the vesicoureteric orifice and measure the distance from the orifice to the midline of the dorsal bladder wall (MVU distance). The type of bladder dysfunction was determined by urodynamic studies. Forty-two children with no history of kidney or bladder disease were examined by DUS as a control group. MVU distances were compared between several groups of children with different urodynamic findings, and the significance was tested. Jets were visualized in 81% of children. MVU distances were significantly lower in children without VUR compared to those with VUR. No statistically significant differences were observed between children without VUR and those with VUR and more severe urodynamic disturbances like dysfunctional voiding. In children with neuropathic bladders, jets were visible in only 57% of refluxive units and the range of MVU distances was very wide (5-22 mm). If a cut-off point of 10 mm is used, in children without bladder dysfunction the sensitivity of MVU measurement in the diagnosis of VUR was 87.5% and the specificity 97%. However, in children with non-neuropathic and neuropathic bladder dysfunction, the sensitivity was only 55% and the specificity 79%. Color Doppler (DUS) and measurement of the MVU distance proved useful in predicting VUR only in children with normal bladder function. In children with neuropathic and non-neuropathic bladder dysfunction it can be used to visualize ureteric jets, but cannot replace radiographic or radionuclide voiding cystourethrography."

Opinion is divided as to whether the often-observed association of PUV with renal dysplasia represents a primary malformation or a secondary pathology caused by recurrent infections. These aspects should have an influence on therapeutic consequences and optimal timing of therapy in order to preserve long-term renal function. The histology of kidney specimens from 13 children with PUV who underwent nephrectomy was reviewed to attempt to differentiate between primary dysplastic malformations and secondary pathologies. Clinical data were analyzed and compared with the histologic findings. The average age at nephrectomy was 29 months (range 3-158 months). Approximately 80% of the specimens showed primary dysplastic malformations (mesenchymal or fetal cartilage tissue or dysplastic glomeruli and tubuli) in the presence of well-developed renal parenchyma. All specimens showed secondary pathologies such as renal-cortical atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and interstitial-nephritis atrophy. The histologic evidence of well-differentiated renal parenchyma in concurrence with dysplastic parenchyma makes infravesical obstruction as the only cause of renal alterations in patients with PUV questionable. This coincides with the fact that organogenesis of the kidney is terminated at the 12th gestational week and secondary renal damage is irreversible at the 20th gestational week, but prenatal urinary diversion of the upper urinary tract is feasible in the 20th gestational week at the earliest. These facts must be taken into account when considering intrauterine urinary diversion."

The overall agreement of both cycles in detecting VUR in this study was 45%, the lowest being in detecting VUR I (36%), and the highest in detecting VUR III (86%). If we had used a conventional RVC (the first cycle only), 17 (29%) VUR I, 50 (36%) VUR II and 3 (9%) VUR III, which were detected in the second cycle only, would have been missed. We conclude that cyclic RVC detected 43% more VURs than the conventional (first cycle only) RVC, and would therefore recommend its use as a standard procedure instead of the conventional RVC."

Report of 64 cases].,"Sixty four cases of ureteroceles in a context of pyeloureteric duplication were reviewed. They were detected antenatally in 69% of cases. Upper pole nephroureterectomy was performed as first-line procedure in 32 cases. In 37.5% of cases, this procedure was followed by lower tract reconstruction, essentially because of symptomatic reflux in the inferior renal pelvis. Complete renal and vesical reconstruction was performed as the first-line procedure in 6 cases. An ureteropelvic anastomosis allowed preservation of the superior renal pelvis in 4 cases, including one case with secondary lower tract reconstruction. Intravesical reimplantation of the two ureters was performed in 8 cases. Primary endoscopic opening of the ureterocele was performed in 10 cases and complementary surgery was required in 7 cases. Other procedures were used more rarely: temporary ureterostomy, nephrostomy, resection of the protruding dome of a cecoureterocele. Current management is usually neonatal. The first step consists of prevention of infection. The therapeutic approach depends on the quality of the superior renal pelvis assessed by DMSA renal scintigraphy. Immediate complete reconstruction of the kidney and bladder is now rarely indicated. When the superior renal pelvis is not functional, resection should be considered with aspiration of the ureterocele. A complementary bladder procedure is required in some cases (40% in our series) to treat symptomatic reflux in the inferior renal pelvis. When the superior renal pelvis is functional, ureteropelvic anastomosis is a good solution, especially when the superior ureter is very large and poorly functional, but endoscopic opening of the ureterocele can also be proposed, which may need to be followed be intravesical reconstruction."

CD010657,0,21969093,0,Matrix metalloproteinase 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 in vesicoureteral reflux.,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether urine levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (uMMP9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (uTIMP1) are novel biomarkers of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and to determine the optimal cut-off levels of these enzymes to predict VUR in children. The study group consisted of 67 children with VUR and 20 healthy children. Urine MMP9 and TIMP1 levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Children with VUR had significantly higher uMMP9 (1,539.8 vs. 256.4 pg/mL; p = 0.0001) and uTIMP1 (182 vs. 32.6 pg/mL; p = 0.0001) levels than healthy children. For the prediction of VUR, the sensitivity of uMMP9 was 67%, with a specificity of 85% [cut-off value 1,054 pg/mL; area under the curve (AUC) 0.77], and the sensitivity of uTIMP1 was 74%, with a specificity of 65% (cut-off value 18.7 pg/mL; AUC 0.73). Both uMMP9 and uTIMP1 levels were significantly higher in patients with renal scar (uMMP9: 3,117.3 vs. 1,234.15 pg/mL; p = 0.0001; uTIMP1: 551.05 vs. 128.64 pg/mL; p = 0.0001). Urine MMP9 levels had a sensitivity of 81.2%, with a specificity of 85% to predict renal scar in the VUR group (cut-off 1,054 pg/mL; AUC 0.88). The sensitivity of uTIMP1 was 75%, with a specificity of 90% to predict renal scar (cut-off 243.7 pg/mL; AUC 0.82). Based on these results, we suggest that uTIMP1 may be a useful marker to predict renal scarring with a different cut-off value from VUR and a high specificity at this cut-off point. Although uMMP9 seemingly cannot distinguish renal scar from VUR, the simultaneous increase in the level of both markers may indicate ongoing renal injury due to VUR."

The purpose of our study was to compare ultrasound voiding cystography (USVC) for the detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children with direct radionuclide voiding cystography (DRVC). Ninety-nine children, aged 1.1-12.3 years, with 198 potentially refluxing units, were investigated simultaneously by DRVC and USVC. The indications for cystography were urinary tract infection, follow-up of a previously detected VUR, and screening of siblings of children with VUR. During the investigation an echo-enhancing agent (Levovist) was administered intravesically through a catheter already in place for the DRVC. The movement of both agents, radiotracer and Levovist, was registered simultaneously by a computerized gamma camera and US, respectively. The results were analyzed with DRVC representing the reference diagnostic test. The overall sensitivity and specificity of USVC for the detection of VUR were 79% and 92%, respectively. USVC may represent a reliable diagnostic tool for the detection and follow-up of VUR in children."

The pathophysiologic changes in acute pyelonephritis include tubulointerstitial inflammation/pus with impairment of the renal microcirculation due to compression of the glomeruli, small peritubular capillaries and vasa recta by interstitial edema.

Thirty infants (age range 5 days to 3 years, mean age 7.9 months; male:female: 22:8) underwent MRU using T2 and contrast-enhanced dynamic T1-weighted sequences. The results were compared with the findings of ultrasound ( n=30), intravenous urography (IVU, n=19) and/or scintigraphy ( n=25) based on the criteria suggestive of obstructive uropathy. Oral sedation was sufficient to perform MRU with diagnostic quality in 20 of 21 patients younger than 1 year; 9 older patients needed intravenous sedation. Diagnosis of the 66 renal units (58 kidneys, 29 successful examinations) included normal systems (contralateral units), duplex systems, vesico-ureteral reflux, obstructive megaureter, ureteropelvic junction obstruction and accompanying renal parenchymal disease, with complex pathology in 10 patients. Magnetic resonance urography demonstrated anatomy better than IVU, particularly the renal parenchyma, (ectopic) ureters, and poorly functioning dilated systems. Magnetic resonance urography was superior to US in showing ureteral pathology. Tiny cysts in dysplastic kidneys were better seen by US. Gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MRU allowed accurate assessment of obstruction applying IVU criteria. Here MRU matched IVU results, and most of the scintigraphic findings. Magnetic resonance urography can be performed in young infants with diagnostic quality using oral sedation. Magnetic resonance urography correctly depicts anatomy and allows assessment of the urinary tract better than US and IVU, with additional functional information. Magnetic resonance urography thus has the potential to replace IVU for many indications."
CD010657,0,2965898,0,Suprapubic micturition cystourethrography.,"Suprapubic micturition cystourethrography is performed by puncturing the bladder aseptically, in the midline, 1 to 2 cm above the symphysis pubis with an 18 to 21 gauge needle. The needle is pointed 10 to 15 degrees cranially to avoid puncture of the trigonum and urethra. Anaesthesia, antibiotic protection, and diuretics are not necessary. In 225 examinations performed on 200 patients, the only complications noted were transient haematuria (1.5%) and slight extravasation of contrast medium through the puncture sites (8%). None required any therapeutic measures. In 4 patients puncturing of the bladder needed ultrasound guidance. The technique is ideal for the study of vesicoureteral reflux, neurogenic bladder, urethral strictures, posterior urethral valves and other urethral pathology. It is also useful in balloon catheter dilatation of urethral strictures. Suprapubic micturition cystourethrography is safe, efficient and time-saving.

Analysis of our experience].,"We have evaluated 465 patients diagnosed as having vesicoureteral reflux between 1975 and 2000 in our Department. Three hundred cases were treated surgically and 165 received submucosal injection of Teflon as endoscopic procedure. Since 1991, when we introduced the endoscopic technique in our Department, 31 patients required open surgery. The work includes the study of the diagnostic procedures performed in the patients, such as ultrasonography, voiding cystouretrography and renal isotopic gammagraphy. We focused on these patients treated endoscopically. The overall success rate was 97.6% with surgical techniques. Reflux was resolved using the endoscopic procedure in 76% after first injection, 93% after second and 96% after third. We conclude that the submucosal injection of Teflon is an appropriate treatment for most cases of vesicoureteral reflux. The non-invasive procedure requirement, lack of adverse effects and minimal morbidity make it an alternative to medical treatment and open surgery. The future is the search for new biocompatible materials with tissue-augmenting properties as Teflon."

One hundred twenty-two patients (ages range, 1 month to 17 years) with 244 ureterorenal units underwent voiding color Doppler US with echo enhancement, which was followed by VCUG on the same day. After US of the urinary tract, the bladder was filled with saline solution via catheter. Then an echo-enhancing agent was instilled, and color Doppler US was performed. Reflux was diagnosed when microbubbles appeared in the ureter or the pelvicaliceal system. VUR was detected in 98 units. All grades of reflux were identified. In 13 units (13.3%), grade I reflux diagnosed at voiding color Doppler US was not observed at VCUG. No reflux was detected in 146 units by either method. In 231 (94.2%) of the 244 ureterorenal units, there was concordance between the two methods. The echo-enhancing agent was well tolerated by all patients. Voiding color Doppler US with echo enhancement is useful for the diagnosis or exclusion of VUR, being as good as VCUG. Therefore, it may reduce the number of patients exposed to ionizing radiation."

CD010657,0,8398641,0,The small scarred kidney in childhood.,Reflux nephropathy is now a generally accepted term to describe small scarred kidneys discovered during childhood; it recognises the close association between this renal lesion and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). This paper briefly reviews the pathogenic factors involved in reflux nephropathy and suggests that at least two main mechanisms operate: acquired segmental scarring due to intrarenal reflux and congenital maldevelopment (renal dysplasia). The spectrum of renal changes associated with VUR can be usefully divided on this basis and the opportunity to recognise by fetal ultrasound those renal lesions acquired in utero may further enhance our understanding of the congenital maldevelopment group.

About 13-17% of children with posterior urethral valves develop end stage renal failure. We present a  6-month-old boy with late diagnosis of posterior urtehral valves. Antenatal ultrasound investigation of the urinary tract was normal. A small degree of oligohydramnios was found during delivery. At the age of six months the boy was admitted to hospital because of urinary tract infection, hypertension (130/90 mmHg) and acute kidney injury (urea - 46 mg/dL, creatinine - 1.1 mg/dL, GFR - 35.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 ). Bilateral hydronephrosis and megaureters, low-capacity bladder with hypertrophied wall were seen on ultrasound examination. Voiding cystourethrograhy revealed vesicoureteral refluxes (III/V), hypertrophy of the bladder wall with numerous diverticula and dilated posterior urethra. During urethroscopy urethral valves were resected. Increased intravesical pressure (leak point up to 305 cm H2 O) was found on urodynamic test. Renal scintigraphy (99mTc-EC) revealed decreased intake of isotope in the left kidney (5%), and the right kidney intake was 95% ERPF. The patient was qualified for left-sided nephrectomy, which was postponed because of high leak point and high risk of worsening of vesicoureteral reflux to right kidney after nephrectomy. Anticholinergic and α-blocker treatment was started. At the age of 11 months left-side nephrectomy was performed because of recurrent urinary tract infections.

CD010657,0,9859510,0,"[Bladder malfunction, urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux in children].","A correlation between urinary tract infection, vesicoureteral reflux and voiding disorders has increasingly been reported. Voiding dysfunction increases the incidence of recurrent urinary tract infection, induces and perpetuates vesicoureteral reflux, even after surgical antireflux treatment, and may result in permanent renal damage. The resolution of the primary cause with voiding normalization is essential to achieve good results in the treatment of secondary problems such as urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux. Thirty seven children with vesicoureteral reflux secondary to voiding disorders were diagnosed and treated between 1990 and 1995 (five years). Forty-nine ureters were studied. The subjects became symptomatic between 1 month and 13 years of age, with the occurrence of urinary tract infection. All children were neurologically and morphologically normal. Symptoms suggesting bladder instability were detected in 34 (91.9%) and dysfunctional sphincter obstruction in three (8.1%). These patients were all evaluated with a renal/bladder sonogram and voiding cystogram, complemented in 17 (45.9%) with urodynamic testing that confirmed clinical diagnosis. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans performed on 29 (78.4%) children revealed renal damage in 26 (89.6%). A treatment program of bladder retraining and bowel habit normalization was encouraged in every child, anti-cholinergic drugs were associated in 23 (62.2%), muscle-relaxant drugs in three (8.1%), phenoxybenzamine and intermittent catheterization were used in one child (2.7%). Urinary tract infection prophylaxis was instituted in 34 (91.9%) children. Urinary tract infection was completely resolved in 35 (94.6%) patients, and its frequency decreased in two (5.4%). Thirty-two children (86.5%) with vesicoureteral reflux were cured and four (10.8%) were improved. Evidence of voiding disfunction ceased in 22 (59.5%) cases and improved in 14 (37.8%) with a reduction in the frequency and intensity of complaints. Urgency syndrome and vesicoureteral reflux remained unchanged in one child (2.7%). These findings imply that detection and treatment of bladder/sphincter disfunction are essential in every child with the complex of recurrent urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux."

CD010657,0,6473770,0,Urinary tract infections in children: renal ultrasound evaluation.,"Ultrasound may replace urography in screening pediatric patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections but without vesicoureteral reflux. A child undergoing a first radiographic evaluation for urinary tract infection is initially examined by voiding cystourethrography. If reflux is present, urography is performed. If no reflux is present, the kidneys are evaluated by real-time ultrasound; urography may also be performed if the ultrasound examination is abnormal, equivocal, or inadequate. A total of 192 patients was evaluated with this protocol; 146 (76%) had no reflux and therefore were examined with ultrasound. One patient was found to have hydronephrosis and underwent surgical correction. This group of patients was compared with a similar group of 223 patients without reflux who were evaluated by urography prior to the institution of the ultrasound protocol; there was no significant difference between the two groups in upper urinary tract findings that influenced patient management."

Twenty-two patients were enrolled in this study. There were no patients with hypertension except one patient with proteinuria. The extraction factor by Heyman's method in these patients tended to increase with age at operation and decrease with the grade of reflux at operation.

The group included more girls than boys. A systematic diagnostic investigation, consisting of a detailed medical history, physical examination, urinalysis and sonography of the kidneys and bladder, was carried out in all cases. This investigation was followed by urodynamic tests to detect any functional disorders of the lower urinary tract. Finally, a voiding cystogram, urethral calibration and urethrocystoscopy were conducted to screen for morphological changes. Three major groups of causes of enuresis were identified. Functional miction disorders were found in 312 (46.4%) children. In these cases there was an inability to voluntarily control the detrusor, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and hyperactivity of the detrusor. 223 (33.2%) of the children had pathological anatomical changes of the urinary tract, such as malformations leading to vesicoureteral reflux, vesicular diverticula, duplication of the upper urinary tract, megaureter, urethral stenosis or urethral valves, with associated infection. Psychogenic disorders were diagnosed in 137 (20.4%) cases. The first group received drug treatment and biofeedback training for reestablishment of conscious control over the vegetative functions of the lower urinary tract. The second group underwent surgery for correction of the pathological anatomical changes. The third group was referred for psychotherapy."

Vesico-ureteric reflux and urinary tract infection remain in very close relationship, they may also occur separately. The factor promoting renal injury is also young age of a child. The aim of this paper was to analyse the influence of the selected factors, namely: degree of the vesico-ureteric reflux; child's age at reflux diagnosis time as well as the frequency of recurrences of urinary tract infections exerted on reflux nephropathy. In 45 children with diagnosed vesicoureteric reflux the intensity of renal scarring was estimated using planar scintigraphy with DMSA-Tc-99m and a questionnaire was prepared. The questionnaire included information as follows: age at which the diagnosis was established, degree of reflux at the time of diagnosis, treatment applied, frequency of urinary tract infections before and after having taking medical care of children. It was revealed that the degree of scarring correlated with degree of vesico-ureteric reflux of particular kidney. In the investigated group no correlations were found between intensity of renal scarring and both the age of establishing diagnosis and frequency of urinary tract infections before starting the treatment. Taking the obtained results into consideration it seems, that the degree of vesico-ureteric reflux estimated prior to treatment determines degree of renal injuries though, undoubtedly all factors being studied affect renal scarring."

All patients underwent intravenous urography (IVU), voiding cystouretrography and 99mTc DMSA renal scanning. The sensitivity and specificity of the DMSA scan and IVU for detecting renal scarring were investigated. With regard to the presence of renal scarring, the sensitivity and specificity of IVU and DMSA were not found to be statistically different. But when the scars were scored, DMSA was found to have a higher scoring index compared to IVU. In patients who were candidates for surgical management of VUR, renal scars could be detected both by IVU and DMSA scan but, for the follow-up, the DMSA scan was found to be the investigation of choice."

CD010657,0,2660762,1,[Role of ultrasound in studying the first urinary infection in children].,"A retrospective study comparing the findings of ultrasonography (5 MHz transducer) versus intravenous pyelography and voiding cystourethrography was conducted in 92 patients during the course of an initial urinary tract infection (greater than or equal to 10(5) bacteriae/ml, WBC greater than 25/mm3) gathered over a period of 5 years. The average interval of time between ultrasonography and intravenous pyelography was 8 days (range 1-70). False positive results for ultrasonography were noted in 11% (5 of 45 cases), while false negatives were observed in 36% (17 of 47). Of the 47 cases of obstructive uropathy diagnosed by conventional means, ultrasonography missed the diagnosis in 1 case of ureteral duplication as well as in 16 children with vesicoureteral reflux. In comparison, intravenous pyelography missed 8 of these 21 cases of vesicoureteral reflux. Overall sensitivity of ultrasonography was mediocre at 64% but excellent at 96% after excluding cases with vesicoureteral reflux. Specificity was poor for the group of patients with vesicoureteral reflux (33%) and did not improve when they were excluded (40%). Sensitivity and specificity were comparable whatever the age group. In conclusion, we would recommend that when both ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrography are normal in children with a urinary tract infection, intravenous pyelography could safely be deferred."

The amount injected ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 ml (mean 0.3). A single injection cured the reflux in 26 ureters (65%) and the grade of reflux improved in a further 9 ureters. Seven ureters required a second injection and reflux was cured in 6 of these. The overall cure rate was therefore 80% after the second injection. There was one complication due to self-limiting ureteric obstruction following injection. The procedure is quick, easy to perform and effective. We have some reservations about the long-term efficiency and safety of subureteric Polytef injection in children."

CD010657,0,2562013,0,Urography versus DMSA scan in children with vesicoureteric reflux.,"Following the diagnosis of primary vesicoureteric reflux, identified as part of the investigation of urinary tract infection, 299 refluxing kidneys in 202 children (aged 0-14 years) were prospectively evaluated using intravenous urography (IVU) and the DMSA renal scan at least 4 weeks after urine infection. There was 88% concordance between IVU and the DMSA scan, but in 12% there were discrepancies manifested in 37 kidneys from 31 children. Thirty-four kidneys were normal on IVU but showed scars of reflux nephropathy (RN) on the technetium 99m--dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan; 4 of these (2 infants and 2 pre-school children) had severe generalized changes on scanning. Three kidneys were normal of DMSA scan and, although abnormal on initial IVU, were considered to be normal when this was repeated. During a follow-up period of 5 years an annual DMSA was undertaken in 194 patients and the renal scars remained unchanged in all except 1 child. The IVU was repeated 1-3 years after the initial study in 31 children in which the results of the first imaging did not agree. In 28 patients (34 kidneys) in which the initial IVU was normal but the DMSA abnormal, IVU evidence of scarring emerged in 30 of 34 kidneys, including the 4 patients with severe generalized damage on the DMSA. We conclude that abnormalities detected by the DMSA scan may precede the radiological findings, especially in young children. Even severe RN can be established in kidneys that appear normal on the IVU."
CD010657,0,1441497,0,Urinary tract infections in children. An update.,"Urinary tract infection is a common and frequently recurring condition in children. The susceptibility of the host, the presence of urinary tract abnormalities, and the virulence of the urinary pathogens are of primary importance in the development of the infection. Renal parenchymal scarring, hypertension, and renal insufficiency are well-established complications of the infection in children. To reduce the risk of renal damage, diagnosis and treatment must be prompt. The diagnosis demands radiologic evaluation of the urinary tract in all boys, all children younger than 5 years, all patients with voiding dysfunction, and school-aged girls with recurrent infection to identify those patients with vesicoureteral reflux, obstruction, or other urinary tract abnormalities. Both voiding cystourethrography and renal ultrasonography are the initial examinations to use to determine the next appropriate study. Children with vesicoureteral reflux or with recurrent urinary tract infections should receive prophylactic antibiotic therapy and should be observed closely to prevent renal scarring."

CD010657,0,11744799,1,"Retrospective study of children with acute pyelonephritis. Evaluation of bacterial etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, drug management and imaging studies.","The purpose of the study was to investigate the management of pyelonephritis in a large Italian pediatric population. A total of 1,333 patients (36% male) were considered. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (89.9%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (3.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (2.1%). 27% of microorganisms were resistant to amoxicillin, 4% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 11% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2.4% to gentamicin and less than 2% to ceftazidime. Despite this resistance pattern showing that oral antibiotics, such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, are effective in vitro as well as parenteral antimicrobials, a parenteral antibiotic was given initially to 756 (57.2%) children. A prophylactic regimen was started in 922 patients with a rate of reinfection during prophylaxis of 9.5%; a higher rate of reinfection was observed in patients with reflux (25%) compared to children without reflux (3%) (p < 0.0001). Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 30% of patients. The number of renal abnormalities detected by DMSA in patients with and without reflux was significantly different (p < 0.001). CRP was higher in patients with scars (p < 0.02). In conclusion, pyelonephritis represents a common disease with about 2,500 days of hospitalization per year in the Veneto Region where there is a pediatric population of about 800,000 under 15 years of age. The results of antimicrobial in vitro tests indicate that amoxillicin/clavulanic acid could represent the antibiotic of choice. The high frequency of malformations, observed even in children between 6 and 12 years of age, may suggest the need of an imaging study including DMSA scan and VCUG in all age groups."

It is well known to be associated with hypertension and renal failure. This has led to regular long-term follow-up of patients, clinically and radiologically. We report the findings of renal imaging in a cohort of 37 patients with reflux nephropathy 15 or more years after successful surgical correction of vesico-ureteric reflux. The degree of renal scarring had been assessed and recorded at the beginning of the study utilizing a score on the original X-ray films. The scar scores of the current intravenous urography (IVU) imaging underestimate the degree of scarring in 35% of cases when compared with the previously recorded scar scores of the original IVU images suggesting a reduction in the renal scar score in some cases over the years. In the current review, concomitant renal images obtained by IVU and 99mTc dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) scanning were in agreement for scar scoring in only 50% of cases. The original scar score by IVU or the current scar score by either technique does not correlate with blood pressure, urine albumin excretion or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We conclude that serial long-term two-dimensional renal imaging in children with damaged kidneys who no longer have vesico-ureteric reflux, does not provide additional information that will alter clinical management.

Bladder outflow obstruction was rare but lower polar vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), usually of lesser grades, was common. Upper polar function, as assessed by 99mTc-DMSA, was negligible in children with truly ectopic ureteroceles but well preserved in those where the lesion lay wholly intravesically. Lower polar function was good, even in the presence of secondary obstruction, except in 2 infants with major VUR. Twenty-three patients were treated by upper polar nephrectomy plus aspiration of the ureterocele; 2 subsequently required ureterocele excision. Histology of excised specimens indicated that a more conservative approach would not have been rewarded. Where upper polar function was good, conservation was maintained in 3 cases by pyelopyelostomy and in 5 more by excision of the ureterocele plus bipolar ureteric reimplantation. Other operative strategies were employed in 2 cases. Finally, a defined group of 8 children was managed expectantly without untoward results.

In the second group (congenital vesicoureteral reflux) correction was observed in 85% of cases (30/35 controlled cases). In the third group correction of reflux was observed in 83% of cases (5/6). Results in the first group of patients may be due to technical difficulties while injecting of Teflon in small, thickened sclerotic bladders. Though longterm results are still to be evaluated. The sting may be beneficial in patients on dialysis waiting for a renal transplant as it obviates the need for bilateral nephrectomy. In simple congenital reflux short and middle term results are excellent."
CD010657,0,20303517,0,Urinary neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin is a potential noninvasive marker for renal scarring in patients with vesicoureteral reflux.,Renal scarring is a serious complication that often occurs with chronic pyelonephritis in the presence of vesicoureteral reflux. In a previous study we established a rat model of renal scarring in which we found the up-regulation of neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin at the mRNA and protein levels. In this study we evaluated urinary neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin as a potential biomarker for progression of renal scarring in patients with vesicoureteral reflux.

CD010657,0,1640557,0,Pyelonephritis in male infants: how important is the foreskin?,"We investigated the association of the uncircumcised foreskin and pyelonephritis in male infants less than 6 months old. During a 21-month prospective study 94 children (age range 2 weeks to 18.9 years) were hospitalized for febrile urinary tract infection. The male-to-female ratio for 35 patients less than 6 months old was 2.2:1. Of 59 patients older than 6 months the male-to-female ratio was reversed at 0.25:1 (p less than 0.001). In 13 of 24 infants (54%) less than 6 months old and in 8 of 12 boys (67%) older than 6 months a dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan documented acute parenchymal damage (p = 0.72). Vesicoureteral reflux or other genitourinary abnormalities were found in only 3 of 24 patients (12.5%) less than 6 months old compared with 6 of 12 boys (50%) older than 6 months (p = 0.036). Of 24 infants less than 6 months old 22 (92%) were uncircumcised compared with 6 of 12 boys (50%) older than 6 months (p = 0.009). We then retrospectively compared the circumcision status of the infants who had febrile urinary tract infection with a control group of 63 infants matched for age, race and socioeconomic status hospitalized with febrile upper respiratory infection during a similar period. The frequency of uncircumcised infants in the control group with febrile upper respiratory infection was only 44% (28 of 63) compared with 91% of infants with febrile urinary tract infection (p less than 0.001). Overall the findings of the male predominance among patients less than 6 months old with febrile urinary tract infection, the disproportionately high frequency of infants with febrile urinary tract infection who were not circumcised, and the disproportionately low occurrence of vesicoureteral reflux and other genitourinary abnormalities in infants with febrile urinary tract infection strongly support an association between circumcision status and the risk for febrile urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis in male infants."
CD010657,0,1640554,0,Subureteral collagen injection for the endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux in children. Followup study of 97 treated ureters and histological analysis of collagen implants.,"Endoscopic subureteral injection has become an established alternative means for treating vesicoureteral reflux in select children. However, which injection material to use remains a controversy. Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) has been injected in more than a thousand patients with few complications, although experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated migration of the injected particles into distant organs, such as the lungs and the brain, as well as local and metastatic granuloma formation. Therefore, we introduced, following experimental studies in the mini-pig model, glutaraldehyde cross-linked, highly purified bovine collagen for injection. Between June 1988 and October 1991, 97 refluxing ureters in 66 children were treated by endoscopic subureteral collagen injection. In 58.8% of the ureters reflux was cured after 1 and in 77.3% after 2 injections. Considering improvement to grades I and II reflux without further treatment as success, the success rate increased to 68.0% after 1 and to 89.7% after 2 injections. Mean followup was 18.5 months (range 3 to 39 months). After 2 failed injections the patients either returned to antibiotic long-term prophylaxis or the reflux was operatively corrected. The operative procedure was never compromised by the preceding injection. A direct correlation between deficient length of the submucosal tunnel of the intravesical ureter and the iatrogenic malposition of the collagen deposits, and the failures could be demonstrated. Granuloma formation at the site of injection was not found. The results of the histological investigation of the collagen deposits removed at open ureteral reimplantation for failures are reported. It could be demonstrated that endogenous fibroblasts invade the bovine collagen implant and that these cells show active production of new human collagen, types I and III, replacing the implant."
CD010657,0,1640555,0,Endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux with a self-detachable balloon system.,"There is controversy about the use of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) paste in children for the endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux due to evidence of particle migration. However, there are definite advantages in treating patients endoscopically. It is evident that the ideal substance should be able to be delivered endoscopically, conserve its volume, and be nonmigratory and nonantigenic. Towards this goal we developed a catheter with an inflatable, detachable and self-sealing silicone balloon that would fit through a 19 gauge cystoscopic needle. Hydroxy-ethyl-methyl acrylate, a hydrophilic polymer that solidifies within 60 minutes after the addition of ferrous sulfate, was chosen as the filling material for the balloon. Conceptually, the sealed balloon would prevent the migration of hydroxy-ethyl-methyl acrylate and the solidified polymer would prevent volume loss. To test this system reflux was created in 6 Hanford mini-pigs by unroofing the ureters bilaterally. In 2 pigs a previously described method of open surgery was used and in the other 4 reflux was created endoscopically using the resectoscope and laparoscopic scissors. The presence of bilateral reflux was confirmed 4 weeks later with a cystogram and the balloon was implanted unilaterally through a cystoscope. The opposite ureter served as an internal control in all animals. A repeat cystogram was performed 2 to 4 weeks after implantation, demonstrating resolution of reflux in the treated side and persistence of reflux in the opposite untreated ureter. Serial cystograms, ultrasound and excretory urography showed no reflux on the implanted side nor any evidence of obstruction. Tissue sections from various organs showed no evidence of particle migration, granuloma formation or inflammatory reaction. Short-term results show that the balloon implants are able to correct reflux without evidence of obstruction."

CD010657,0,6369711,0,Ureteropelvic junction obstruction in adults.,"Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJ) in adults is more common than generally appreciated. It may mimic other diseases and may be associated with abdominal pain, hypertension, and recurrent pyelonephritis. Diagnosis and surgical correction were frequently delayed with an average duration of symptoms of 3.2 years for 31 adult patients. Only 4 adults (13%) were diagnosed at the time of their initial onset of symptoms. Nephrectomies were performed on 24 per cent of renal units. Accessory lower pole renal vessels were found in 52 per cent of the adults with UPJ obstruction, twice the rate found in children. Intravenous digital subtraction angiography and diuretic radionucleotide renography should be considered in the evaluation of an adult patient with a UPJ obstruction because of the high rate of accessory vessels. If accessory vessels are present on the contralateral side, especially postnephrectomy, there is heightened concern for the remaining kidney and close follow-up with ultrasonography is recommended."
CD010657,0,7955834,0,Isotope renography in childhood enuresis.,"A retrospective review was performed of 100 enuretic children who underwent isotope renography during the period 1981-1989. Studies performed were Tc99mDMSA studies for renal size and to detect renal scarring and renography using Tc99mDTPA or MAG3 to evaluate excretion and detect vesicoureteric reflux. Fifty-five children had microbiological evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and 16 (29%) of these had abnormalities on their isotope studies. Forty-five had sterile urine and all had normal isotope studies. Thus despite recent reports of urodynamic abnormalities and increased incidence of reflux in patients with enuresis, our findings indicate that standard nuclear medicine renal studies show few abnormalities in patients with monosymptomatic enuresis. The 29% incidence of abnormal studies in patients with enuresis and UTIs suggests that the presence of infection should be an indication for further investigation in this subgroup of enuretic children."

CD010657,0,10401028,0,Implications of certain genetic polymorphisms in scarring in vesicoureteric reflux: importance of ACE polymorphism.,"Polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been shown to affect renal prognosis in a number of diseases. We examined the influence of deletion (D) and insertion (I) polymorphism in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and the other polymorphic markers of RAS, and that of plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) on renal scarring in reflux nephropathy. Ninety-four children with third- or fourth-degree reflux were the subject of the study. They were stratified into two groups according to the technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) findings: the first group consisted of 41 patients with no scar formation. In the second group (n = 53), there was significant scar formation in the refluxing units. ACE levels, ACE gene, angiotensin-1 receptor (AT1) A1166C, angiotensinogen (ATG) M235T, and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms were studied. In the second group with scarred kidneys, 18 patients had decreased renal function. The frequency of patients homozygous for the D allele was significantly greater in the second group with scar formation in the refluxing units compared with the first group of patients (P < 0.005). On multivariate analysis, the DD genotype was the only factor that had a significant impact on renal scar formation, introducing a 4.9-fold risk (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval). We were unable to find any correlation with the presence ofDD genotype and hypertension, decreased renal function, proteinuria, or sex of the patient. DDgenotype correlated with the serum ACE levels (P < 0.005). AT1and ATGpolymorphisms and PAI-1 polymorphism did not correlate with scar formation or any of the parameters. This study provides evidence that the DDgenotype of ACE may be a genetic susceptibility factor contributing to adverse renal prognosis in reflux nephropathy; namely, scar formation. The role of the synergism between the aforementioned genetic polymorphisms can be enlightened with larger patient groups, possibly through multicenter studies."

(Impracticable intermittent catheterization). 19 of the 21 cases showed dramatic improvement (narrowing of the upper urinary tract, disappearance of infection and resumption of staturo-ponderal thrive). Only 1 child with valves had to be put on cutaneous ureterostomy. The improvement in the upper urinary tract, as seen on the IVP, is very rapid in valve cases without reflux. The improvement is visible earlier on isotopic renal scans than on IVP. 11 children suffered acute pyelonephritis during vesicostomy. There were no cases of cutaneous peristomal modification. Simultaneous closure of the derivation and surgery of the primitive disease were performed in 10 cases after a 1-3 year period of vesicostomy. Vesicostomy will succeed in those babies who have shown clinical and biological improvement after a short period of trans-urethral or suprapubic catheterization. The suprapubic endoscopis treatment of the valves becomes possible through the vesicostomy hole excluding urethral trauma."
CD010657,0,9368270,0,"Classification of anorectal malformations--initial approach, diagnostic tests, and colostomy.","The optimal surgical care of patients with imperforate anus begins with appropriate decision making in the critical newborn period. In most cases the decision to create a colostomy should be delayed until the infant is 18 to 24 hours old. Except in cases of a rectoperineal fistula, most neonates are best treated with a completely divided left-lower-quadrant colostomy between the descending and sigmoid colons. Female patients with cloacal anomalies must be recognized at birth so that all urgent urologic evaluations can be performed. Hydrocolpos and obstructive uropathy are common in these neonates and warrant urgent decompression of the urinary tract with a vaginostomy and/or vesicostomy as well as a colostomy. Renal ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrography are mandatory for all patients regardless of the height of the defect. It is critical to discover the important precursors to renal insufficiency including renal agenesis, renal dysplasia, and vesicoureteral reflux in the neonate. The presence of these anomalies mandates early consultation with a pediatric urologist because the morbidity and mortality of these lesions often exceed those of the imperforate anus. Spinal cord anomalies are common and can be found even in patients who have normal plain films and low defects. Spinal ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed in all neonates to rule out occult spinal pathology such as tethered cord or lipoma of the cord. Efficacious and cost-effective care of patients with imperforate anus begins with a carefully thought out plan in the neonate. Optimal execution of the evaluation and surgical treatment at this phase sets the stage for the best possible outcome later in life."

CD010657,0,16082551,1,Evaluation of acute pyelonephritis with DMSA scans in children presenting after the age of 5 years.,"It is generally believed that infants are more susceptible to development of renal scarring after pyelonephritis than children over 5 years old. This view has led to differences in investigations and treatment according to age. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the occurrence of renal parenchymal lesion in children over 5 years admitted with a first-time symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). Between October 2000 and April 2002, 52 children aged over 5 years who were admitted to our department with probable acute pyelonephritis (APN) and a positive urine culture were included in this study. All children received antibiotics for 14 days. During the acute phase of infection, scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and ultrasonography (US) were done. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed in all children early in the course of the illness, generally within 5-7 days of hospitalization. When scintigraphy showed renal parenchymal changes, repeat scintigraphy was done after at least 3 months to assess the progression of renal abnormalities. Of the 52 children with a first-time documented pyelonephritis, cortical scintigraphy showed renal lesion in 41 children (78.8%). US was normal in all children with normal renal scintigraphy, while it detected renal abnormalities in 16 of the 41 (39 %) with abnormal scintigraphy (p <0.0001). Topographic analysis of the 165 focal lesions showed that 42.4% were localized to the upper poles, 17.5% to the middle third, and 40% to the lower poles of the kidneys. Repeat scintigraphy showed persistent lesions corresponding to those on the initial scan in nine (28.2%) of the 32 children. Renal lesions had partly regressed in 23 (71.8%) of the patients who underwent repeat scintigraphy. Vesicoureteral reflux was observed in 13.4% of kidneys and renal parenchymal abnormalities were identified in 71.4% and 72.2% of renal units, respectively, with and without reflux ( p >0.05). In conclusion, our data did not confirm the conventional opinion that the risk of renal scarring after pyelonephritis is low in children over the age of 5 years. Our findings suggest that renal scintigraphy may be a more appropriate method of investigation than VCUG for evaluation of the children over 5 years with acute pyelonephritis. Additionally, the frequency of scintigraphic changes is high, and a strategy based exclusively on ultrasound findings would miss about 61% of the abnormal renal units. We recommend that all children, irrespective of age, will benefit from further investigations that might prevent or limit the development of scarring process and renal complications."

Recent advances in tissue-harmonic and contrast-specific imaging techniques, together with the development of second-generation contrast agents, have improved the potential of ultrasonography both in the diagnosis and grading of VUR in children. Today, VUS is able to accurately assess the grade of reflux and the state of the urethra, previously considered fundamental limitations to the extensive use of this technique. The aim of our paper is to review the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of VUR, from the initial experiences up to the recent use of second-generation microbubbles combined with contrast-specific low-mechanical-index software. We discuss the advantages and limits of VUS with respect to radiographic and radionuclide imaging in the light of an analysis of the most recent literature, and we described the new VUS study technique using second-generation contrast media. Growing requests by paediatric nephrologists and surgeons require that even general radiologists become familiar with this technique."
CD010657,0,9059183,0,Clinical relevance and implications of antenatal hydronephrosis.,"Detailed antenatal sonography was performed on 18766 pregnant women between 1990 and 1994. Antenatal hydronephrosis, defined as an antero-posterior diameter of the renal pelvis (APPD) greater than 5 mm, was detected in 100 cases (0.59%). Sixty four infants had postnatal hydronephrosis at one and/or six weeks after delivery; 21 of these had urological anomalies. Twelve infants had vesico-ureteric reflux. In all refluxing units the APPD of the renal pelvis was less than 10 mm. Three patients had obstruction at the pelviureteric junction (PUJ); all required surgery. Vesico-ureteric reflux is emerging as the most common urological finding in infants with antenatal hydronephrosis and is likely to be missed if kidneys with APPD of less than 10 mm are not further investigated. In contrast, pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction may be overdiagnosed, based only on drainage patterns of dynamic renogram studies."

The study comprised 105 siblings of patients with VUR. Their age ranged from 4 months to 6.3 years. All had a direct radionuclide voiding cystography (DRVC) performed, and VUR was detected in 47 of 105 (45%). High grade VUR in the first year of life had an incidence of 50% compared with a 9% incidence in siblings older than 2 years, while only one of the 27 siblings with a low VUR grade was younger than 1 year. In 43 of 47 siblings with VUR, a technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scan was performed and renal scars were found in 10, which presents 23% of siblings with VUR who were scanned and 10% of all siblings studied. One child had hypertension. Identifying VUR among asymptomatic siblings could possibly prevent renal damage and its consequences. Thus, the predictive value of positive family history alone in identifying VUR was 45% while 23% of siblings had renal scars. This incidence justifies the routine investigation of asymptomatic siblings, by using DRVC at an early stage."

We need the direct contact between doctors before or after investigations, interdisciplinary discussions, and rapid access to the images. This should lead to optimal settings for investigations, a reduction of radiation burden and the number of investigations, and further improvement in the management of patients. Modern sonography including colour Doppler sonography, amplitude-coded Doppler sonography, and eventually 3D-ultrasound is and will be the method of choice as the basic, non-invasive investigation. These investigations should become the routine in all institutions. Refinement and standardisation of already established investigations are needed. Recently introduced investigations, like MRI, will have to show their impact on future diagnostic imaging. Future introduction of new non-invasive methods is welcome, e.g. to correctly diagnose vesicoureteral reflux without catheterisation/puncture of the bladder."

In the past few years, the increasing use of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans, urodynamic testing, and antenatal sonography have helped shed light on the interrelationship of these disorders. Renal parenchymal involvement during acute febrile UTI and subsequent renal scarring are quite commonly observed in the absence of VUR, suggesting that the presence of reflux is not a prerequisite for renal damage. In infants with gross VUR, renal damage is often present at birth even before the development of any UTI. High intravesical pressures during bladder filling and voiding are commonly observed in infants with gross VUR, reflecting an underlying voiding dysfunction. High voiding detrusor pressures are also commonly observed in infants presenting with symptomatic UTI who do not have VUR. Children with dysfunctional voiding states are at risk for development of VUR and UTI. Renal damage in these children may occur in the absence of one or the other. This review elucidates how voiding dysfunction predisposes children to bacterial colonization of the bladder, the development or perpetuation of VUR, and renal damage."

We were able to identify four typical pathological uptake patterns: (i) pole defect(s), usually wedge shaped (60%); (ii) lateral wedge shaped defect (4%); (ii) scattered multiple defects (21%); and (iv) swollen kidney without areas of diminished uptake (15%). Remaining pathology at follow-up was found in 52% of the kidneys. Vesicoureteric reflux was present in 33% of the children with scintigraphic signs of pyelonephritis.

Their indications, potential, benefit and setbacks/restrictions are discussed with regard to the literature and the constantly changing clinical demand. With the introduction of EECS a new and reliable tool has been established to be useful for follow-up and screening for vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR); however, with the growing importance of functional disturbances a reliable method to evaluate both function and anatomy/VUR as offered by modified VCU is mandatory, and thus VCU remains to play a major part in evaluating children with urinary tract infection, suspected VUR, hydronephrosis or functional bladder disturbances. While EECS offers a new method for certain indications, such as follow-up examinations in VUR or screening, VCU remains an irreplaceable tool for evaluating anatomy (particularly the male urethra) and bladder function (if performed using the modified technique)."

Postnatal ultrasound findings were assessed in a population diagnosed as having antenatal hydronephrosis due solely to primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) to see whether this is justified. The postnatal ultrasound and MCU findings in 177 patients with primary VUR detected as antenatal hydronephrosis were reviewed retrospectively. A total of 132 (75%) were boys. Reflux was unilateral in 103 cases and bilateral in 74 (42%). Altogether 37% of boys and 33% of girls with a renal pelvic diameter of < or = 10 mm had grade III-V VUR. Calyceal and/or ureteric dilatation had specificities of 87-96% for grade III-V VUR, but sensitivities of only 37-54%. Fifty eight per cent of male and 75% of female renal units with grade III VUR and 17% of male units with grade IV-V VUR were normal on ultrasound. Approximately 25% of ultrasonically normal renal units had grade III-V VUR on MCU. Postnatal ultrasound criteria correlate poorly with the presence and degree of VUR in children with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and should not be used to direct the use of cystography."

The applicability of ultrasound was studied in 54 spinal cord injury patients by correlating uroradiological examinations with ultrasound. Emphasis was placed on ultrasonic imaging of ureterectasis and vesicoureteral reflux. Ultrasound confirmed all positive radiographic findings of renal and bladder abnormalities (renal calculi, chronic pyelonephritis, trabeculated bladder and bladder calculi), and yielded additional information in 27 per cent of the kidney and 13 per cent of the bladder studies. Ultrasound was used to confirm vesicoureteral reflux in 56 per cent of the patients and ureterectasis in 33 per cent. It is recommended that spinal cord injury patients undergo a baseline excretory urogram followed by periodical ultrasound examinations to detect hydronephrosis, renal parenchymal disease, and renal and bladder calculi, and to measure bladder volume and residual urine.

The results were considered positive when there was any increase in pelvis size and/or ureter lumen width during voiding. The overall sensitivity of IVUS in the detection of VUR was 49%, specificity 75%. The most accurate results were obtained with VUR grade III, where IVUS correctly detected 6 out of 7 cases, a sensitivity of 86%. The average increase of AP pelvis diameter during voiding was highly significant only in uretero-renal units with VUR grade III. Considering the obstacles in conducting the investigation and its relatively low overall sensitivity and specificity, it seems that IVUS is not sufficiently reliable to replace echo-enhanced VUS."

CD010657,0,23241875,0,Update on recent guidelines for the management of urinary tract infections in children: the shifting paradigm.,Recent guidelines on the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children have seen a shift from aggressive imaging studies and the use of prophylactic antibiotics to a more restrictive and targeted approach. This review focuses on new additions to the literature on management of UTI from January 2011 to September 2012.
CD010657,0,25864614,0,Sonographic assessment of the effect of vesicoureteral reflux and urinary tract infections on growth of the pediatric solitary kidney.,Perusal of recent guidelines relating to proper evaluation of infants and children with urinary tract infection (UTI) suggests that the occurrence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) may not have the clinical import previously ascribed to this anatomic abnormality. Patients with a solitary kidney uniquely allow investigation of the effects of both vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and urinary tract infection (UTI) on renal growth unencumbered with the inevitable questions of laterality that confound analysis in patients with two kidneys. Several previous studies with conflicting results have addressed whether vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) impacts ultimate renal size in children with a solitary kidney. Few published studies have considered the occurrence of both urinary tract infection (UTI) and VUR on the degree of compensatory hypertrophy. This is the largest series to date investigating the effect of both UTI and VUR on the degree of compensatory hypertrophy with time.

CD010657,0,11702144,0,Ultrasound contrast agents and their use in urogenital radiology: status and prospects.,"Ultrasound contrast agents (USCAs) for intravenous use are usually microbubbles with a mean diameter less than that of a red blood corpuscle and filled with gas. The USCAs may improve information about tissue characteristics and physiology by enhancing B-mode imaging, all Doppler modalities and by means of contrast-specific imaging, e.g. harmonic and stimulated acoustic imaging. Results from preclinical experiments have been promising, and several of these have been reproduced in clinical studies. This includes improved evaluation of renal vasculature and parenchyma, assessment of vesicoureteral reflux in children, assessment of tubal patency in women, and evaluation of prostate diseases and erectile dysfunction in men. Some of the physical limits of the ultrasound technology, as well as the operator-dependent factors, can probably never be overcome by the use of USCAs; however, the development of USCAs is now about to provide uroradiologists with potentially efficacious products for the benefit of the patient."
CD010657,0,7906765,0,Ultrasonic indicators of ureteric reflux in the newborn.,"There is controversy over the value of ultrasonic screening for detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in babies. We scanned 300 newborn babies and identified 53 with a dilated renal pelvis or other minor abnormalities. Eventually, 9 of these were investigated by voiding cystourethrography and 3 (5 kidneys) proved to have VUR exceeding grade II. In 3 babies the reason for cystourethrography was persistent renal pelvis dilation; in 3 it was urinary tract infection; and in 3 it was a new ultrasonic sign observed early in the series--ballooning of the renal pelvis during voiding. Whereas persistent dilation of the renal pelvis was a non-specific indicator (absent in 2 of the 5 affected kidneys and present in 5 of those unaffected), ballooning was consistently seen in all 5 affected renal pelvises. This sign, easily obtained in a baby who has been sleeping, deserves prospective assessment for its value in screening."

CD010657,0,7869522,0,Contralateral vesicoureteral reflux in children with a multicystic kidney.,"Multicystic kidneys are commonly diagnosed today due to the widespread use of prenatal ultrasound. Children with a multicystic kidney are at increased risk of contralateral renal abnormalities. We performed a voiding cystourethrogram on 65 children with a newly diagnosed multicystic kidney to determine the incidence of contralateral vesicoureteral reflux. Ten children (15%) with a multicystic kidney had contralateral vesicoureteral reflux, including 8 of 37 boys (22%) and 2 of 28 girls (7%). Contralateral reflux occurred in significantly more white (22%) than nonwhite (4%) patients (p < 0.001). Reflux was grade I in 2 children, II in 2, III in 2, IV in 1 and V in 3. All children were placed on antimicrobial prophylaxis. During a mean followup of 3.1 years grades I and II reflux resolved. Grade III reflux resolved in 1 child and remained stable in 1. Grade IV reflux was downgraded to III in 1 child on prophylaxis. One child with grade V reflux was stable on prophylaxis while the remaining 2 patients underwent ureteroneocystostomy. No child had a urinary tract infection. A significant proportion of white children with a multicystic kidney have contralateral vesicoureteral reflux and initial imaging should include a voiding cystourethrogram."

The radiopharmaceutical preparation 131I-orthoiodohippuran was used, the result of the examination was a separated effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) which was assessed according to a modification of Oberhausen's method. A total of 28 children were examined. In 8 children the vesicorenal reflux was grade III and IV, in 20 children a unilateral grade II vesiculorenal reflux was involved. In both groups the authors demonstrated a significant functional deficit (p less than 0.001) of the kidney with the reflux despite the fact that in the second group all children had normal excretory urography, a negative urinary sediment and a normal creatinine and urea blood level."

CD010657,0,9467256,0,[Radiologic aspects of the coexistence of vesicoureteral reflux and other abnormalities of the urinary tact in children].,"In this report cases of the coincidence of vesicoureteral reflux with different congenital abnormalities have been described. Radiological and ultrasonographic examinations of 240 children with 324 vesicoureteral refluxes showed the presence in 8.7% additional congenital anomalies such as: duplex pelvicaliceal system and duplex ureter, ureterocele, horseshoe kidney, primary megaureter, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, posterior urethral valves, neurogenic bladder. The coincidence of these abnormalities with vesicoureteral reflux caused some diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. In conclusion we suggest that in the cases of the coincidence of different congenital abnormalities, the proper sequence of performed diagnostic examinations and complexity evaluation of the results are very important."

A total of 129 consecutive children with a urinary tract infection referred for a DMSA scan in a 2-year period (January 1992-January 1994) were retrospectively studied. The results were analysed in terms of kidneys, and the incidence of cortical defects was determined. Eighty-eight patients (68%) had a radiographic micturating cysto-urethrogram within 6 months of the DMSA scan, and in this group the relationship of defects with vesico-ureteric reflux was determined. Overall, 81/258 (31%) of kidneys had a cortical defect on a DMSA scan. Of those who had a micturating cysto-urethrogram, 53/176 (30%) kidneys had vesico-ureteric reflux, and of those that had reflux, 21/53 (40%) had a cortical defect on a DMSA scan. In the group of children without reflux, 38/123 (31%) had a cortical defect. Renal cortical scan defects are common findings in paediatric urinary infection, and frequently occur in the absence of vesico-ureteric reflux. These defects represent either established scars or acute pyelonephritis that can proceed to scarring. The micturating cysto-urethrogram alone is insufficient as a screening modality to identify those kidneys at risk of renal scarring."

Additional dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy in this setting is a common but not routine practice to determine whether there is parenchymal injury. Because dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy involves further time, expense and radiation, we determined whether ultrasound findings could substitute for dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy.

Constipation may cause UTI, enuresis and VUR due to the uninhibited bladder contraction. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of nocturnal enuresis, UTI and instability symptoms in chronic functional constipation (CFC). This study included 38 children with CFC and 31 children as the control group. Detailed past and present history of UTIs or symptoms pointing to this diagnosis, enuresis, encopresis, urgency and urge incontinence was obtained from both groups as well as the family history of UTI. Urinalysis, urine culture and stool parasite analysis as well as abdominal ultrasonography were performed on both groups. Age range of the children with CFC was 6-192 months (mean +/- standard deviation (SD) 63.5 +/- 51 months); that of the control group was 4-180 months (mean +/- SD 82 +/- 46.2 months). Frequency of UTI and urgency was significantly higher in the CFC group. However, frequencies of urge incontinence, nocturnal enuresis, and genitourinary abnormalities were not different between the two groups. In conclusion, risk of UTI and urgency is increased in CFC, but that of other voiding dysfunctions like urge incontinence do not change significantly. Therefore, we suggest that UTI and urgency should be questioned in children with CFC and vice versa."

CD010657,0,17544626,0,Renal infection and vesico-ureteric reflux.,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease of childhood. The investigation of UTI in children has been the subject of debate and controversy for many years. Most workers agree that the first imaging modality to be used should be an ultrasound examination to exclude obstruction, structural abnormalities, and renal calculi. The role of (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is becoming increasingly important. Many argue that if the DMSA study is normal at the time of acute UTI, no further investigation is required because the kidneys have not been involved and thus there will be no late sequelae. Others use the acute DMSA study to determine the intensity of antibiotic therapy. The importance of the role of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) is being debated. Some workers will only proceed to cystography to detect VUR if the DMSA study is abnormal, whereas others advocate a more aggressive approach. VUR can be identified by a variety of radiological and scintigraphic techniques. Although the radiological cystogram is the gold standard and is essential in the first UTI in a male patient, to exclude the presence of posterior urethral valves, radionuclide cystograms are advantageous in other situations. Suprapubic cystography techniques have been described to overcome the trauma of urethral catheterization but have not been widely accepted."

The present work aims to describe a certain number of these clinical entities, to discuss the strategic options of management that are proposed, and to evaluate the role of medical imaging, in particular the radionuclide approach. Congenital ureteropelvic junction anomaly, vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valves, and duplex kidney will be successively considered.

We report on a 7-year-old child who presented with severe UTI. The early (day 4) renal computed tomography (CT) scan showed normal-sized kidneys (110 mm on the left, 105 mm on the right), whereas the control CT scan and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, performed 1 and 2 months later, respectively, showed a small scarred right kidney (60 mm) with a 12% residual function. An intermittent right vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed by direct isotopic cystography and then treated by Cohen vesicoureteral reimplantation. The patient remained free of infectious recurrence, hypertension, or renal function decrease. This report demonstrates that one episode of acute pyelonephritis can lead to severe renal scarring. Whereas antenatal lesions are thought to have a stronger role in the causal pathway for reflux nephropathy than is UTI in addition to VUR, this observation reminds us that UTI can truly play an important role in damaging kidneys."

CD010657,0,10815457,0,[Investigation of the urinary tract in children in nuclear medicine].,"The early detection of urologic abnormalities by antenatal sonography has resulted in the investigation of many infants and neonates for suspicion of either obstructive uropathy or reflux nephropathy. Nuclear medicine techniques allow to assess renal parenchyma integrity, to detect pyelonephritic scars and to measure absolute and relative renal function; these methods are easy to perform and reproducible, without any sedation, repeated venous punctures or bladder catheterization. Furthermore, the use of dynamic tubular tracers and frusemide test is a very usefull method which can differentiate between upper and/or lower urinary tract obstruction and determine the degree of obstruction (severe or incomplete) in order to plan for surgery or conservative treatment. The detection of vesicoureteric reflux may be difficult as it is an intermittent phenomenon: the use of the indirect radionuclide cystography (IRC), that is to say after completion of a dynamic renography, allows to detect reflux with a high sensitivity because images can be recorded continuously until the child voids, without any bladder catheterization and at low radiation dosis. In case of discordant results between micturating cysto-urethrography and IRC or of concomittant obstructive uropathy, the direct radionuclide cystography (DRC) is indicated for appropriate treatment. Nuclear medicine techniques do not give morphological information about the urinary tract and should be considered as complementary to radiological investigations in first evaluation of children with recurrent urinary tract infections or hydronephrosis."
CD010657,0,8988117,1,Are younger children at highest risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis?,The general belief about the relation between risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis and age is that infants are at highest risk and children older than 5 years at lower risk.

CD010657,0,14689290,0,Videourodynamics in the diagnosis of urinary tract abnormalities in a single center.,"The lower urinary tract is a complicated structure and there has been some controversy regarding the biomechanics and dynamics of bladder and sphincter function. Investigation of the function and morphological anomalies is very important. Videourodynamics (VUD) combined with conventional voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) seems to be the most appropriate method. Over a 12-year study period (January 1990 to December 2001), 422 children (aged 5 days to 20 years) prospectively underwent VUD to further define their urinary tract abnormalities. In all children the history was recorded, clinical examination, urinalysis, culture, and ultrasonography performed, and serum creatinine determined before VUD. The selection criteria included a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) in 310 patients (74%), urinary tract dilatation without UTI in 31 patients (7%), suspected neurogenic bladder dysfunction in 42 patients (10%), and voiding difficulties in 39 patients (9%). VUD consists of cystometry (CM), which is the measurement of detrusor pressure during controlled bladder filling and subsequent voiding, and was combined with VCUG using X-ray contrast material. CM is used to assess detrusor activity, sensation, capacity, and compliance. CM measurements were recorded on a computer and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was documented at the same time with plain films and later in a PACS system. The VUD diagnosis was of normal bladder function in 46 patients (9%), VUR in 212 (43%), unstable bladder dysfunction in 152 (31%), neurogenic bladder dysfunction in 35 (7%), urine outflow obstruction in 15 (3%), wide bladder neck in 22 (4%), and vaginal reflux in 9 (2%). Neurogenic bladder dysfunction was excluded in 7 patients (1%). VUD is useful for the investigation of the lower urinary tract function together with X-ray morphology. The advantage of these studies is that they combine the objectivity of urodynamics with the visual radiographic image, leading to lower radiation doses and a more logical interpretation of the results."
CD010657,0,17211588,0,Lack of association of IL8 gene polymorphisms with familial vesico-ureteral reflux.,"Vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common inherited disorder of the lower urinary tract. Children with VUR are at risk for ongoing renal damage with subsequent infections. IL8 is an important inflammatory mediator which can be produced by epithelial cells of the renal tract in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli. High serum concentrations of IL-8 have been reported in patients with chronic renal failure. Elevated IL-8 levels have been reported in the urine of patients with VUR and renal parenchymal scarring (RPS). More recently it was reported that urine IL-8 levels remain elevated in infants with VUR even in the absence of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Increased IL-8 expression has been shown to be associated with polymorphism at position -251 (rs4073) of the IL-8 promoter. The aim of this study was to examine the association of IL-8 gene polymorphism with familial VUR in a cohort of 219 siblings from 109 families affected with VUR, the largest such cohort tested to date. RPS was assessed using dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. Genotyping was performed in 219 siblings with VUR (157 without RPS, 62 with RPS) and 292 controls for the position -251 of IL-8 gene by polymerase chain reaction with tetra primers and gel analysis. Genotype was compared using the chi square test. Statistical significance was taken as a value of P < 0.05. There were no significant differences in IL-8 -251 genotype frequency between VUR patients and controls. Similarly, gender, severity of VUR and renal parenchymal scarring had no effect on IL-8 -251 genotype frequency. Although IL-8 urinary levels have been reported to be elevated in VUR, our data indicate that IL-8 gene is not involved in the pathogenesis of familial VUR or reflux nephropathy."

CD010657,0,2849382,1,99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan as first investigation of urinary tract infection.,"A total of 115 children under 5 years who presented with a first symptomatic urinary tract infection and who had a 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan were studied to assess its value and compare the findings with those of other imaging techniques. Renal cortical defects were detected in 65 kidneys by DMSA scan, intravenous urogram, and ultrasound scan combined; 62 (95%) being seen on DMSA scan. The finding of reflux on micturating cystourethrography showed a highly significant correlation with renal defects seen on DMSA scanning, a less close but still significant correlation with abnormalities on intravenous urography, but none with ultrasound scan findings. The sensitivity of the DMSA scan in screening for all grades of reflux is estimated as 0.66, which is higher than that previously reported for the intravenous urogram or ultrasound scan. DMSA scans were less likely to miss grade 3 reflux than the other two methods. DMSA scans are more useful than other upper renal tract imaging techniques in detecting renal defects. Consideration should be given to their use as a first investigation in place of routine intravenous urograms. Ultrasound scans alone will overlook potentially serious urinary tract abnormalities."

In 15 children, abdominal sonography was performed 1-5 days after Teflon paste injections. Follow-up sonograms performed 5 weeks to 1 year after the procedure are available in nine children. Sonographically, the Teflon paste at the injection site appears as a hyperechoic focus within the bladder wall with distal shadowing seen postoperatively and on follow-up examinations. This finding occurred in 22 (88%) of 25 treated ureters. The location of Teflon paste after injection as viewed via cystoscopy is correlated with the sonographic appearance. This preliminary report suggests that sonography is useful in determining the location and size of the Teflon mass, in evaluating surrounding soft tissues at various time intervals after injection, and in assessing possible complications such as obstruction."

All these studies were performed in 130 pediatric patients, with urinary tract infection (42 patients), vesicoureteral reflux (37), and unilateral or bilateral small kidney(s) (51). The number of renal scars detected was highest with the 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT-1 scan and next came the 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT-2 studies. There is a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the ability of planar and SPECT-1 to recognize renal defects.

Ten of 20 infants had abnormal VCUGs--6 with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and 4 with bladder trabeculation alone. Only 2/20 neonates had abnormal ultrasounds--both with hydroureteronephrosis secondary to VUR. Elevated leak point pressure (LPP) and/or detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) were present in 10/20 infants--6 with elevated LPP and DSD, 3 with elevated LPP alone and 1 with DSD alone. Eight of 10 neonates with DSD or elevated LPP had abnormal VCUGs--4 with VUR and 4 with bladder trabeculation alone. Conversely, 8/10 neonates without DSD or elevated LPP had normal VCUGs. Contrast VCUG performed shortly after birth, therefore, is essential for the discovery of bladder trabeculation and reflux. There is a strong correlation between an abnormal VCUG and the presence of DSD and elevated LPP, suggesting that neurogenic bladder dysfunction in utero can lead to these structural abnormalities."
CD010657,0,10360509,0,Insights into the pathogenesis and natural history of fetuses with multicystic dysplastic kidney disease.,"To better delineate the natural history of multicystic displastic kidney disease (MCDKD) and provide insights into the pathogenesis of this condition, we report our experience in 102 prenatally detected cases. MCDKD is most commonly an incidental finding on prenatal ultrasound examination. The abnormality may be unilateral (76 per cent) or bilateral (24 per cent). In unilateral cases, abnormality of the contralateral kidney is common (33 per cent). Associated non-renal abnormalities occur frequently with both unilateral (26 per cent) and bilateral (67 per cent) MCDKD, and increase the risk for an abnormal chromosome study. Males are more likely to be affected than females with a ratio of 2.4:1, but females are twice as likely to have bilateral MCDKD and associated non-renal abnormalities, and four times more likely to have an abnormal chromosome study. We suggest that the option of chromosomal analysis should be discussed with all patients diagnosed with MCDKD in their fetus, if there is bilateral renal involvement or if an associated non-renal abnormality is present. Unilateral MCDKD without associated renal or non-renal abnormalities was not associated with an abnormal chromosome study, and resulted in favourable outcomes. While unilateral MCDKD, lack of associated anomalies, normal chromosome study and adequate amniotic fluid are all reassuring findings, a complete neonatal urologic work-up should be performed in all newborns. We believe the evaluation should include voiding cystourethrography to rule out vesicoureteral reflux. Our findings allow more precise counselling of patients regarding prognosis, and subsequent management of the fetus found to have MCDKD."

Over-all, 57 patients (92 ureters) were treated. The majority of ureters (68.5%) had grade II to III/V vesicoureteral reflux (international classification). One treatment was given in 61.4% of the patients, while 33.3% required 2 and 5.3% required 3 treatments. Nonduplicated/primarily refluxing ureters comprised 68.5% of the total, while 13% were duplex/primarily refluxing and 18.5% were surgical failures. The procedures were performed on an outpatient basis in all but 3 patients. Patients were evaluated by voiding cystourethrogram and renal/bladder sonography before and after treatment at 1 month and 1 year. Cure at 1 month after the last treatment was achieved in 75% of the ureters. Among the ureters cured at 1 month the cure persisted in 79% at 1 year after treatment. Cure at 1 year was achieved in 65% of all ureters evaluated, regardless of the status at 1 month. Procedure-related morbidity was minimal and there were no adverse reactions to the implant substance. Thus, glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine dermal collagen appears to be safe and effective in the endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux."

The high incidence of hydronephrosis in first degree relatives supports the hypothesis that PUJ hydronephrosis is inherited by an autosomal dominant gene of variable penetrance. There is a genetic inter-relationship between PUJ hydronephrosis and a bifid pelvicaliceal system and therefore indirectly between vesico-ureteric reflux and paraureteric diverticula.

Two groups of patients were selected: group I comprised 40 children who underwent IRC during the acute phase of urinary tract infection and an MCUG 6 weeks later; group II comprised 42 (other) children with known reflux, who underwent IRC and DRC during follow-up. Taking as the reference the total number of refluxing kidneys detected by means of any cystographic technique, 99mTc-MAG3 ICR missed two-thirds of the refluxing kidneys. Most of the small refluxes were missed, but so too were 50% of the major refluxes. Taking as the reference 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, MCUG detected 91% of the patients with DMSA abnormalities on at least one kidney, DRC detected 95%, and IRC detected 46% and 43% respectively, in groups I and II.

We used isotopic cystography (IC) for diagnosis of VUR in children with febrile UTI. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy was performed 6 months after cure of the last UTI. Renal defects were defined by the finding of focal defects of radionuclide uptake and/or by a split renal function <43%. The study included 206 children with primary VUR and 77 without VUR. Among the subjects with and without VUR, respectively, renal defects were found in 40 and 6% (p=0.0001), focal uptake defects in 33 and 5% (p=0.0001) and split renal function <43% in 26 and 5% (p=0.0001).

We retrospectively studied patients with MCDK disease to determine the prevalence of contralateral renal abnormalities and of other urologic anomalies. Forty-nine patients, ranging in age from neonates to 6 years, were examined by renal ultrasonography, excretory urography or nuclear medicine scanning, and voiding cystourethrography; 51% of the patients had an associated urologic abnormality. The abnormality was contralateral to the MCDK in 19 patients (39%), ipsilateral in 3 patients (6%), and involved the bladder wall in 3 patients (6%). The most common contralateral genitourinary tract abnormality was vesicoureteral reflux (18%) followed by ureteropelvic junction obstruction (12%). We conclude that urologic anomalies are common in patients with MCDK disease; contralateral vesicoureteral reflux is the most common abnormality identified."

This study aimed to determine 1) the incidence of cortical scarring in Thai children presenting with upper urinary tract infection, 2) the association between VUR with acute pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring, 3) the use of DMSA and direct radionuclide cystography (DRNC) scintigraphy in children with UTI. Sixty newly diagnosed UTI children underwent DRNC and Tc-99m DMSA renal cortical scintigraphy at the time of first UTI diagnosis and 6 months later. There were no significant differences of age, sex, type of antiobiotics and pathogens (E. coli vs non-E. coli) between those who did and did not develop scars (p>0.05). 58/98 of 1st DMSA abnormal kidneys (59.18%) developed scars. 60.20 per cent of 98 positive 1st DMSA had VUR while 80.33 per cent of 61 with VUR had positive 1st DMSA. 59.02 per cent of these 61 kidneys developed scars. Scar occurrence were 18.7 times in high grade VUR compared to low grades. In conclusion, there was a high incidence of acute pyelonephritis in the presence of VUR but acute pyelonephritis does not necessarily need VUR for its development. High grade reflux with upper UTI, is a strong indicator for renal scarring. Children presenting with UTI, irrespective of age, sex, or pathogen, should have both DMSA and DRNC scintigraphy performed to identify upper UTI and high risk patients who will develop subsequent renal scarring."

The main issue is to distinguish those cases of dilatation which are clearly obstructive and need surgical treatment from those which are within the normal anatomical range. Out of 47 patients with primary megaureter, 23 were nonobstructive, these are the aim of our study. There were 16 males and 7 females; 13 were located on the left side, 7 on the right side and 3 were bilateral, adding up to 26 reno-ureteral units. Prenatal diagnosis was performed in 16 cases, the eldest patient diagnosed was nine. All infants were evaluated with ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, excretory urography and diuresis renography. The latter has been the most important test inducing us to adopt a conservative attitude. Differential renal function was more than 40% in 24 units and in 2 was more than 35%. Diuretic renograms were type IIIa (Dilated non obstructed) in 19 cases and IIIb (Dilated partially obstructed) in 7. There were 2 cases with vesicoureteral reflux in the contralateral system. We have performed ultrasonography and diuresis renography during the follow-up. There were 8 cases with type I (Normal) renograms and 17 cases with type IIIa. Only one patient developed an obstruction and was operated on. In every case differential renal function did not deteriorate. In 9 cases urography was performed in order to see the anatomical changes. They have remained asymptomatic during the follow-up except for two cases which presented urinary tract infection.

CD010657,0,15717974,0,Molecular biology of ureteral bud and trigonal development.,"Advances in molecular biology have provided valuable insight into the development of the urinary tract, particularly ureteral bud formation. Reciprocal inductive signals between the ureteral bud and growing kidney are crucial for normal development. The Wolffian duct serves as the site of origin of the ureteral bud and forms distal excretory ducts that are incorporated into the developing bladder to become the trigone. Vesicoureteral reflux and renal dysplasia can result from abnormal position of the ureteral orifice on the trigone. The presumed origin of trigone formation is based largely on evaluation of human and animal models performed nearly a century ago. The trigone is thought to develop from the mesodermal germ cell layer; however, several recent studies have shown that endoderm may be the tissue of origin. This review highlights important discoveries in the field of molecular biology as it relates to the development of normal and abnormal ureteral bud formation. It also describes the anatomic relationship between the developing bud and trigone as it pertains to clinically relevant urinary tract anomalies, including recent discoveries that attempt to prove the origin of the trigone."

This study was undertaken to assess if phase inversion ultrasound (PIUS), a recent microbubble specific imaging technique, has advantages over fundamental in VUS and if it allows a reduction of contrast agent dose. Forty-three children with suspected VUR (aged 3 days-12 years, average of 3.9 years) with 92 kidney-ureter units (KUU) were included. Everyone obtained a baseline US scan that was followed by VUS using Levovist as the contrast agent. Constant switching between fundamental and PIUS performed the enhanced part for comparison. Every child underwent VCUG immediately afterwards. Contrast enhancement was stronger and longer lasting on PIUS than on fundamental US in all 43 cases. Reflux was detected in a total of 21 KUU, out of 92 KUU (23%). PIUS revealed VUR in 18; fundamental in 14 KUU and VCUG depicted 16 cases of reflux (p> or =0.29). The mean volume of Levovist dose administered to the bladder was 7.4+/-3.4% of the bladder volume. VUS using PI mode provided considerably stronger and longer enhancement and slightly improved the detection of VUR. It allowed a reduction of contrast dose and cost by approximately 35% over current dose recommendations for fundamental US."

Results of a coordinated research project.","Acute pyelonephritis (APN) may produce permanent renal damage (PRD), which can subsequently lead to diverse complications. We prospectively evaluated 147 females and 122 males (mean age 3.5 years) with APN in order to analyze the relationship between the presence of PRD, at the time of cortical renal scintigraphy, and age, gender, episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI), and presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).

Four children with bilateral reflux with bilateral difference of severity more than 2 grades were also included. Obstruction was attributed to posterior urethral valve in 5, anterior urethral stricture in 3 and mega-urethra in 1. The chief complaints were febrile episodes and urinary infection, followed by voiding difficulty, bed wetting and/or urinary incontinence and voiding through anus. All 4 children with troubles other than posterior urethral valve had either anorectal anomaly or H-type rectourethral fistula without imperforate anus. Of the 9 children 8 had massive reflux on the left side. The majority of these left ureters with massive reflux were associated with ipsilateral severe renal hypofunction on scintigraphy. After prompt resolution of obstruction, the majority of these massive reflux did not disappear. Decompression appeared to salvage none of such kidneys. The orifice positions of such ureters were far cranio-lateral and the resected kidneys showed dysplasia or severe hypoplasia. The prognosis was generally excellent except one child with massive reflux on the right side who progressed to an end-stage renal disease. The embryogenesis of this ""VURD syndrome"" was discussed in its relation to the ""bud theory"" of renal hypo-dysplasia. It was showed that this syndrome was observable in obstructions other than the posterior urethral valve. Massive reflux appeared to serve as ""pop-off"" mechanism to buffer high pressure and to lead to preservation of better renal function. Reflux in children with congenital mechanical obstruction may be the result of 2 different mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

This was compared to the conventional methods for measuring GFR using 51-chromium-EDTA clearance (Cr-EDTA), creatinine clearance and a height/plasma creatinine formula. In the 22 children studied, the correlation coefficient between renal uptake of DTPA and Cr-EDTA was 0.90 (p less than 0.001). In contrast, there was a poorer correlation between Cr-EDTA and creatinine clearance (r = 0.69) or the derived GFR using height/creatinine formula (r = 0.83). The regression line between Tc-DTPA uptake and Cr-EDTA clearance was used to derive a formula for calculating the predicted GFR. This was tested in 10 additional children, and the correlation between the predicted GFR and measured GFR (using Cr-EDTA clearance studies) was 0.92 (p less than 0.001). Quantitative estimation of the GFR during renal imaging studies is a feasible and convenient method of assessing renal function."

We assessed parental satisfaction associated with patient and parent experience of voiding cystourethrography without sedation."

The galactose-based agents are comparable in the diagnostic range with the standard fluoroscopic cystography, providing high values of sensitivity and specificity. The purpose of our work is to show our experience during last three years with the urethrosonocystography with echo contrast in the diagnosis and follow-up of pediatric patients with urological malformations."
CD010657,0,22128870,0,Pediatric febrile urinary tract infections: the current state of play.,"Studies undertaken in recent years have improved our understanding regarding the consequences and management of febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are amongst the most common serious bacterial infections in childhood, with renal scarring a frequent outcome. In the past pyelonephritic scarring of the kidney, often associated with vesico-ureteral reflux (reflux nephropathy) was considered a frequent cause of chronic renal insufficiency in children. Increasing recognition as a consequence of improved antenatal ultrasound, that the majority of these children had congenital renal hypo-dysplasia, has resulted in a number of studies examining treatment strategies and outcomes following UTI. In recent years there is a developing consensus regarding the need for a less aggressive therapeutic approach with oral as opposed to intravenous antibiotics, and less invasive investigations, cystourethrography in particular, following an uncomplicated first febrile UTI. There does remain a concern that with this newer approach we may be missing a small subgroup of children more prone to develop severe kidney damage as a consequence of pyelonephritis, and in whom some form of intervention may prove beneficial. These concerns have meant that development of a universally accepted diagnostic protocol remains elusive."
CD010657,0,12595511,0,Primary vesicoureteric reflux as a predictor of renal damage in children hospitalized with urinary tract infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Renal parenchymal disease after urinary tract infection (UTI) has been associated with the development of hypertension and renal functional impairment. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed to determine how effectively the finding of primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on micturating cystography (MCU) in children hospitalized with UTI predicted renal parenchymal disease on (99m)Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy. Medline, Embase, and PubMed were use to find reports with original data for children hospitalized with bacteriologically-proven UTI who had undergone both MCU and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy, and which also reported both positive and negative results of these tests. A meta-analysis of likelihood ratios positive and negative for MCU was then performed, including tests for heterogeneity. Twelve valid studies were found, seven with data for 537 children, with a positive (99m)Tc-DMSA scan prevalence of 59% overall, and seven studies with data for 1062 kidneys, with a positive (99m)Tc-DMSA scan prevalence of 36%. The likelihood ratio positive for MCU was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.51 to 2.54) for children, and 2.34 (1.53 to 3.57) for kidneys. The likelihood ratio negative was 0.71 (0.58 to 0.85) for children and 0.72 (0.61 to 0.86) for kidneys. There was evidence of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis showed that a positive MCU increases the risk of renal damage in hospitalized UTI patients by about 20%, whereas a negative MCU increases the chance of no renal involvement by just 8%. VUR is hence a weak predictor of renal damage in pediatric patients hospitalized with UTI. Physicians should be aware of the limitations of using MCU-detected primary VUR as an effective screening test for renal damage in this population. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of renal damage in such patients is probably complex because it is often detected without demonstrable VUR."
CD010657,0,9220477,0,Urodynamically controlled management of spinal cord injury in children.,"Spinal cord injuries in children are relatively uncommon. However, infants with cervical spine injury have an especially high risk of renal damage. Six patients, 4 of them tetraplegic, aged 15 months to 8 years, were primarily treated by oral anticholinergic medication and intermittent catheterization. With this concept, satisfactory results were achieved in 4 of 6 children for a mean follow-up of 17.7 months. Mean bladder capacity increased by 128% and intravesical pressure was reduced by 35%. While all patients initially presented with a detrusor leak point pressure above 40 cm H2O, in 4 patients detrusor leak point pressure could be sufficiently reduced by initial treatment. One patient required intravesical instillation of oxybutynin; in another patient sphincterotomy was performed. No patient had signs of renal damage. In summary, even in tetraplegic infants, oral anticholinergic medication and intermittent catheterization is a safe and well-tolerated treatment."
CD010657,0,11355070,0,Role of beta 2-microglobulinuria and microalbuminuria in pediatric febrile urinary tract infection.,"Urinary beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2M) and microalbumin concentrations were analyzed in 61 pediatric patients with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). The results were compared with those of technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Noninvasive evaluations were made to localize the site of the UTI. Increased urinary beta 2M/Creatinine (Cr) or microalbumin/Cr quotients were not associated with renal inflammation, as defined by a positive renal scan. Increased urinary microalbumin/Cr is associated with UTI in febrile patients regardless of the level of infection (scan status), and may be an informative indicator of UTI. When microalbumin/Cr was > or = 0.03, its sensitivity and specificity to predict UTI in febrile patients, regardless of the site of the infection, were 95.65% and 51.79%, respectively, and its positive predictive value was 62.0%. On the other hand, urinary beta 2M/Cr (> or = 0.13) demonstrates a statistically significant correlation with the presentation of a high grade of vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0.02). We suggest that a prompt renal imaging study is warranted when the urinary beta 2M/Cr ratio is high (> or = 0.13)."

Should surgery be indicated based on observed deterioration of differential renal function (DRF)? Can we expect improvement of the DRF after pyeloplasty? What other influencing parameters may affect DRF?"
CD010657,0,3880909,1,Urinary tract infection in infants and children evaluated by ultrasound.,"Fifty-nine pediatric patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) underwent renal ultrasonography, excretory urography, and voiding cystourethrography. The imaging procedures were analyzed retrospectively to determine their relative effectiveness in detecting abnormalities that might predispose the patient to UTI. Voiding cystourethrography provided valuable information, particularly the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux, that could not be obtained from the other procedures. Excretory urography was less specific than ultrasonography in the majority of patients, with the exception of those who had renal scarring. The authors recommended ultrasonography as the initial imaging procedure in the evaluation of children with UTI. When the sonogram is normal, excretory urography is not considered necessary, but voiding cystourethrography is thought to be essential. If sonography is abnormal, excretory urography and/or other follow-up studies are indicated."

(MCUG is only undertaken if the renal pelvic diameter (RPD) is >/= 10 mm or if there is calyceal or ureteric dilatation.)"
CD010657,0,8437263,0,Sonographic evaluation of ureterectasis in children: the significance of peristalsis.,"The presence or absence of ureteral peristalsis was noted during real-time sonography of 61 dilated ureters in children. The findings were correlated with diagnoses established using standard radiographic and radionuclide imaging techniques. Of the 47 dilated ureters that exhibited peristalsis 44 were classified as not obstructed when assessed with standard imaging and functional studies. The most frequent etiology for ureteral dilatation associated with peristalsis was high grade vesicoureteral reflux (31 ureters). Three peristaltic ureters were shown to be mildly to moderately obstructed. Absence of peristalsis was noted in 14 ureters: 13 were severely obstructed, while in 1 the involved kidney had no function. In the pediatric age group the demonstration of peristalsis in a dilated ureter is frequently associated with vesicoureteral reflux and is seldom associated with obstruction. Obstruction, if present, usually is mild. Aperistaltic ureterectasis implies severe obstruction or poor renal function."

CD010657,0,9064670,0,[Non-comparative open study of the efficacy and tolerance of cefaclor in the prevention of urinary tract infections in children].,"Cefaclor has been investigated as an additional prophylactic agent in the UTI. It is active against virtually all common urinary pathogens, is well absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, is well tolerated and safe. The Authors have carried out a clinical trial of the prophylactic use of cefaclor in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in children. We studied 52 children (25 females and 27 males, median age 7 +/- 19 months) with UTI, investigated by imaging (sonography, micturating cystourethrography, renal scintigraphy) and by urodynamic studies. We found vesicoureteral reflux in 37 cases, primitive megaureter in 6 cases, in 1 patient duplication of the collecting system in 1 patient and substenosis of ureteropelvic junction in 1 case. In the others 5 cases the UTI were associated with bladder disfunction and finally in 1 case the UTI occurred in absence of urinary malformations. All patients received cefaclor, as prophylaxis, at the dosage of 10-20 mg/kg/die, administrated as a single bedtime dose. The mean time of treatment with cefaclor was 8 +/- 3,48 months. We observed an optimal compliance in all patients, also in the first year of life. In only two out of 52 patients, during the prophylaxis, we found documented bacteriuria. We stopped treatment in two cases because of an adverse effect (in both children has been demonstrated a cutaneous rash). In conclusion our study shows that cefaclor is an effective, well tolerated and safe agent in the UTI prophylaxis, also in the first year of life, when it seems to offer an optime alternative to other agents."

CD010657,0,19444481,1,Imaging studies for first urinary tract infection in infants less than 6 months old: can they be more selective?,"This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the selective approach of imaging infants < 6 months old with urinary tract infection (UTI) according to the UTI guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2007. Infants < 6 months old with their first UTI from January 2001 to December 2006 having undergone an ultrasound examination of the urinary tract, a micturating cystourethrogram, and a late di-mercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, were included. Their condition was evaluated against a set of risk features according to the UTI guidelines. Those having any one of these were classified as atypical and those having none as typical. There were 134 infants reviewed, with a typical (98 infants) to atypical (36 infants) ratio of 2.7 to 1. Girls were found to be relatively more represented in the atypical group [male (M):female (F) = 1.3:1] than in the typical group (M:F = 4.4:1) (P < 0.004). There were significantly more infants with abnormal micturating voiding cystourethrograms (MCUGs) (P = 0.007), more refluxing ureters (P < 0.001) and more significant vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) (>/= grade III) (P = 0.013) in the atypical group than in the typical group; while there was no significant difference in ultrasound (US) and DMSA scan findings between the two groups. In the atypical group there was no difference in imaging studies (and, thus, the results) between the conventional practice and the NICE UTI recommendation. In the typical group, if the recommendations of the guidelines had been followed (i.e. only those with abnormal US would have been further investigated), 25 refluxing ureters and 22 scarred kidneys would have been left undiagnosed. In conclusion, application of the suggested selective imaging approach would leave a significant number of VUR and renal scars undiagnosed, and it may not be an optimal practice for infants less than 6 months old with their first UTI. The best approach remains to be clarified."

CD010657,0,12696269,0,The role of nuclear medicine in evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux and/or reflux nephropathy.,"Early identification of different categories of the risk of scarring in children with first (or follow up) urinary tract infection and/or early detection and treatment of vesicoureteral reflux are important to prevent kidney impairment. The demonstration and grading of reflux is crucial in examination and follow up of any child with urinary tract infection. Nephro-urologic radionuclide studies are able to detect vesicoureteral reflux and reflux nephropathy, such as radionuclide cystography--RNC--(both direct radionuclide voiding cystography--DRVC--and indirect radionuclide cystography-IRC), renal DMSA scintigraphy, MAG3 renal diuresis scintigraphy and DTPA renal diuresis scintigraphy. They allow to assess renal parenchyma integrity, to detect pyelonephritic scars, to evaluate the different aspects of urinary tract function and to measure absolute and relative function after intravenous injection of radiopharmaceuticals. The procedure, image acquisition and processing and the diagnostic relevance of all aforesaid nephro-urologic radionuclide studies are illustrated."
CD010657,0,20589375,0,Cutting-balloon angioplasty in transplant renal artery stenosis as first-line treatment in the early postoperative period.,Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been successfully used for the treatment of transplant renal artery stenosis (RAS). Cutting-balloon angioplasty (CBA) is being used as a second option in pressure-resistant stenosis. It is thought that CBA is less traumatic and therefore restenosis occurs less frequently than in conventional angioplasty. This case report describes the unusual use of a cutting balloon in transplant RAS as a first option in the early postoperative period. Long-term follow-up data are also presented.
CD010657,0,12696261,0,Diagnostic imaging of vesicoureteral reflux.,The diagnostic imaging modalities for vesicoureteral reflux in children comprise both radiologic and sonographic methods. The radiologic methods are voiding cystourethrography and radionuclide cystography. Voiding cystourethrography is the commonest imaging modality for reflux. With the introduction of pulsed fluoroscopy the radiation exposure of this examination is significantly curtailed. It is the imaging of first choice of the urethra. Various sonographic methods of reflux examination had been tried in the past. The real breakthrough came with the availability of stabilized US contrast media. The diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography has been found to be comparable to the radiologic methods. With the emergence of harmonic imaging the potential for significant improvement of the sonographic method has been achieved. Voiding urosonography is primarily performed in follow-up studies and as the first reflux examination in girls.
CD010657,0,9926301,0,Interest of direct radionuclide cystography in repeated urinary tract infection exploration in childhood.,"108 children with repeated urinary tract infection were examined both with direct contrast cystography and radionuclide cystography. There was a good correlation between the two procedures in the majority of the cases (79), but in 21 cases, direct radionuclide cystography alone was positive and for 8 other children, direct contrast cystography showed a low-grade vesico-ureteric reflux even though radionuclide cystography was negative. When comparing the two procedures and taking into consideration the age of the patients we find that radionuclide cystography is more sensitive to detect vesico-ureteric reflux in the younger population (p < 0.02). This advantage is less clear for older children who more often present a low-grade reflux. Low radiation exposure is also a great advantage of radionuclide cystography, but anatomic definition is better with contrast cystography. It seems thus that the two procedures complement rather than rival each other. Their respective interest for evaluation of repeated urinary tract infection in children therefore depends on age, attain-ability of the procedure, and the possibility of a bladder or ureteral abnormality. Quite a few authors consider radionuclide cystography as at least as valid as contrast cystography, and even more sensitive. We have attempted to compare both procedures and to determine their respective role in repeated urinary tract infection exploration."

In this study, the two techniques were performed simultaneously on a group of 64 children referred for the evaluation of VUR. DRVC detected VUR in 54/128 ureterorenal units, and VUS confirmed reflux in 44 (81%). Only in two cases was the reflux not confirmed by DRVC (97% specificity). Ten units with minimal grade I VUR detected by DRVC were not identified by VUS. For identification of grade II and III reflux, sensitivity of VUS reached 100%. Ten units with grade I VUR at DRVC presented grade II at VUS. Eleven units with grade II VUR at DRVC presented grade III at VUS. In conclusion, contrast-enhanced VUS is a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of VUR in children. Our data suggest a higher diagnostic accuracy of urosonography compared to radionuclide cystography in the determination of the grade of VUR; this may have significant consequences on the management of young patients affected by VUR."

The obstruction can be detected with prenatal ultrasonography screening and treated before renal function is reduced; the obstruction may also resolve spontaneously. Currently, there is no test for predicting the outcome of this obstruction. Management guidelines for neonates with asymptomatic obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction are based on expert opinions, but not on evidence-based data. In our retrospective study, we evaluated management and outcome of 26 renal units in 23 infants (15 boys, 8 girls) with congenital obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction treated in our institution between 1986 and 2001. These infants had isolated hydronephrosis on prenatal and postnatal sonography, showed an obstructive curve pattern in the postnatal diuretic nephrogram and had at least one follow-up nephrogram during a follow-up period of at least 1.5 years. Of these renal units, 16 demonstrated normal function (Group I), five moderate function (Group II) and five severely reduced function (Group III). In group I, 6 of 12 primarily conservatively managed kidneys resolved spontaneously and remained normal in function. In group II, all infants were operated and 83% improved their kidney function. In group III, all infants were operated but none demonstrated relevant improvement. These data support the current expert opinion of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Pädiatrische Nephrologie (APN), that ureteropelvic junction obstruction in neonates with normal renal function can be managed primarily conservatively with close monitoring. In neonates with moderately--but not with severely--reduced renal function, early surgery is effective in the prevention of deterioration."

CD010657,0,25476098,0,Reappraisal of the effectiveness of ⁹⁹mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans for selective voiding cystourethrography in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection.,"Recent studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scans for identifying high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). This study aimed to reevaluate the effectiveness of (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scans for selective voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in children with a first febrile UTI. The medical records of children aged ≤ 5 years who were admitted with a first febrile UTI were retrospectively reviewed. Ultrasonography (US) and DMSA renal scans were performed within 3-5 days after admission, and VCUG was performed 7-10 days after antibiotics treatment. A total of 653 children were enrolled for analysis, including 579 patients aged < 2 years (Group A) and 74 patients aged 2-5 years (Group B). In Group A, DMSA scans were abnormal for 346 patients (59.8%), and normal for 233 patients (40.2%). High-grade VUR was present in 99 of 346 patients (28.9%) with abnormal DMSA scans, but present in only 16 of 233 patients (6.9%) with normal DMSA scans (p < 0.001). Regarding the prediction of high-grade VUR, the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for the DMSA scans were 86.1% and 93.1%, respectively. In Group B, DMSA scans were abnormal for 36 patients (48.6%), and normal for 38 patients (51.4%). High-grade VUR was present in 12 of 36 patients (33.3%) with abnormal DMSA scans, whereas none of the 38 patients with normal DMSA scans had high-grade VUR (p < 0.001). The sensitivity and NPV of the DMSA scans were both 100%. Using the selective VCUG strategy, approximately 40% of Group A patients and 50% of Group B patients could be spared an unnecessary VCUG, respectively. Our study results suggest that (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scans are effective in identifying children with a first febrile UTI for selective VCUG."

Based upon 162 cases representing 181 P.U.J. syndromes (author's transl)].,"The authors present a retrospective analysis over a period of 15 years with a minimum follow-up of 18 months. 34 patients were under the age of 10. In terms of diagnosis and therapeutic indications, intravenous urography remains the basic examination. Two other investigations are extremely valuable: retrograde cystography, in particular in the child, to seek associated vesico-renal reflux and echography, in particular as a harmless means of regular surveillance, both for hydronephroses which have been operated upon and those which have not. Seventy five patients did not undergo surgery and only 25 could be regularly followed up. In contrast to widely accepted ideas, 4 worsened considerably. Only 13 nephrectomies were performed at the outset, including six partial because of double/bifid kidney/ureter. There were thus only 6.7% of total nephrectomies at the outset. Despite this resolutely conservative attitude, there was only one secondary nephrectomy for lithiasis despite a good result of P.U.J. plasty. Renal biopsies confirmed that the renal parenchyma was usually normal, even in the presence of very marked hydronephrosis, in the absence of infection. The results of conservative surgery were good in 83% of cases, thereby justifying the resolutely conservative attitude of the authors. 92 plasties of the pelvi-ureteric junction revealed the rarity (15.2%) of hydronephrosis due to abnormal polar vessel and the relative prevalence (29.5%) of hypoplasia of the first few millimetres of the lumbar ureter distal to the P.U.J."
CD010657,0,16034638,0,[Functional disorders of the lower urinary tract in children].,"Functional disorders of the lower urinary tract as well as vesicoureteral reflux involved in the disease complex of urinary tract infection/permanent renal parenchymal damage can be considered predisposing or risk factors. Two main forms can be distinguished, i.e., unstable bladder and dysfunctional voiding, while transitional forms between the two exist. Functional disorders of the lower urinary tract obstruct spontaneous resolution of vesicoureteral reflux. They are found in about 50% of cases in all children with urinary tract infection and are associated with an increased risk of developing renal parenchymal scars. They are observed during the newborn period up to school age. In the first few months of life, particularly boys with bilateral high-grade reflux and congenital renal parenchymal damage are affected. At later ages girls are also affected, but in this age group bladder instability predominates. Incontinence as the leading clinical symptom appears in approximately 70% of all cases and is closely correlated with chronic constipation. Imaging procedures in addition to urodynamic methods are of decisive importance for diagnosis and treatment, but noninvasive approaches such as sonography should be given preference."

The follow-up DMSA renal scans 6 months after diagnosis revealed normalization of renal changes in 56% (46 patients), much improvement with residual renal abnormality in 6% (5 patients), and persistent parenchymal defects in 38% (31 patients). Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in 32% of children (26/82) and the majority were between grade I and III. Thirteen of those with VUR (50%) developed renal scars on follow-up. Fifty-three percent of the scarred kidneys (19/36) were drained by non-refluxing ureters. In this study, children older than 2 years had less VUR yet were more susceptible to APN and to the development of renal scars. Girls were more prone to developing APN and renal scarring than boys. This work shows that APN is a serious cause for renal scarring in our patients, particularly if associated with other risk factors such as recurrent infections and the female sex."
CD010657,0,12399625,0,Urinary concentrations of alpha-1-microglobulin and albumin in patients with reflux nephropathy before and after puberty.,"We determined urinary concentrations of alpha(1)-microglobulin and albumin in 155 patients with reflux nephropathy including 72 prepubertal (48 males and 24 females) and 83 postpubertal patients (43 males and 40 females) to elucidate the effect of age and gender in the progression of renal damage. Vesicoureteral reflux was resolved in all patients at least two years before enrollment into this study. Renal scarring was diagnosed with (99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan. More severe renal scarring was found predominantly in male compared to female patients. Urinary alpha(1)-microglobulin levels were significantly lower in postpubertal female patients (mean +/- SD: 1.59 +/- 1.02 mg/g creatinine) than in prepubertal males and females (3.32 +/- 3.53 and 4.06 +/- 4, respectively; p < 0.007 and p < 0.002, respectively), and in postpubertal males (3.69 +/- 2.6; p < 0.002) regardless of severity of renal scarring. In the patients with severe unilateral renal scarring, urinary albumin levels were significantly higher in postpubertal males (81.9 +/- 239.5) than in prepubertal males and postpubertal females (25.8 +/- 63.1 and 13.8 +/- 7.7, respectively; p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively). Our results suggest that glomerular injury may develop during adolescence predominantly in male patients with severe renal scarring. In contrast, renal damage indicated by urinary alpha(1)-microglobulon level appears to be ameliorated in female postpubertal patients. This gender difference may be attributed to sex hormones."

International Reflux Study Group in Europe.,"The results of serial dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) imaging over 5 years are reported in 287 children with severe vesico-ureteral reflux entered into the European Branch of the International Reflux Study in Children. The children were randomly allocated to medical (n=147) or surgical (n=140) management and DMSA studies were performed during the follow up period at least 6 months after any urinary tract infection. Abnormal images were classified into four types: (1) large polar hypodensity with normal renal outline; (2) peripheral photon deficient defect(s) in a non-deformed kidney; (3) small renal image with normal contour; and (4) peripheral defect(s) with resultant irregularity of the renal outline. The DMSA findings were abnormal at entry in 235 (82%) with no difference in incidence or severity between the two treatment groups. During follow up, deterioration was observed in 25 medically and 23 surgically treated patients and comprised image deterioration alone in 17, image deterioration with corresponding reduction in differential function in 16 and reduction in relative function without image change in 15, with similar distribution between the two treatment groups. Deterioration was more frequent in children entering the study under the age of 2 years and in those with grade IV rather than grade III reflux. These findings, showing no difference in outcome between children managed surgically or medically, are consistent with the radiological results already published."

The main advantage of this technique is it does not irradiate. Given the important recognition of serial voiding urosonography by the European Society of Pediatric Radiology at the last congress in May 2011, we think it is useful to describe how to carry out this technique successfully.

CD010657,0,2692213,0,Application of Doppler color flow imaging method on the detection of vesicoureteral reflux.,The doppler color flow imaging method was employed to detect the vesicoureteral reflux. The ultrasound examination was performed by using the doppler color flow imaging system. Ultrasonic sector scan was carried out by the use of the 3.75 MHz phased array and/or conbex array transducer with a transabdominal approach. The flow in the bladder from the ureteral orifice to the bladder was detected with a red color indicating the direction towards the probe and the flow from the bladder towards the ureteral orifice during the vesicoureteral reflux was detected with a blue color indicating the direction away from the probe. The doppler color flow imaging method appears to be a useful diagnostic procedure for the detection of the vesicoureteral reflux.

This accumulation of renal diseases of varying origin makes special care for these children necessary. The quality of diagnostic methods is decisive for the choice of therapy. The advantages of primary ultrasound diagnosis and sonographical function tests are described. Sonographical differentiation of disturbances of the urinary transport is possible by means of forced-diuresis ultrasonography, whereas a vesico-ureteral reflux can be detected by means of voiding sonocystography. The value of ultrasound for primary diagnosis, assessment of therapeutic course and postoperative long-term follow-up is discussed."
CD010657,0,10955937,0,Enhanced detection of vesicoureteric reflux with isotopic cystography.,"We compared the accuracy of isotope cystography (IC) and fluoroscopic cystourethrography (FC) in detecting vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children. FC and IC were performed in 124 children, 56 boys and 68 girls, aged 1 month to 9.2 years (mean 2.1 years), admitted consecutively for suspected VUR over a 10-month period. VUR was diagnosed by one or both studies in 51 of 124 (41%) patients. The two methods were concordant for the detection of VUR in 84% of kidney-ureter units and in 93% for the detection or exclusion of severe VUR. IC detected VUR more accurately than FC, both when all grades of VUR were considered together (P=0.00001) and when only severe reflux was considered (P=0.004). VUR was missed by FC in 23 of 51 (45%) subjects. Of those 23, 12 had severe VUR detected on one side at least by IC. VUR was missed by IC in 3 subjects. IC is significantly more accurate than FC in the initial diagnosis of VUR, even of severe grade. IC is the method of choice for the first diagnosis of VUR. Boys with VUR diagnosed by IC also need FC to investigate for posterior urethral valves."
CD010657,0,8302406,0,Value of urinary endothelin-1 in patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux.,"By using a radioimmunoassay specific for endothelin-1 (ET-1), we measured urinary excretion of ET-1-like immunoreactivity (LI) in 63 spot urine samples of 48 patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). And also, urinary excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), beta 2-microglobulin (beta-2-MG), microalbumin (Alb) and creatinine (Cr) were measured. There was no significant correlation in any of the pairs ET-1 and NAG, ET-1 and beta 2-MG, and ET-1 and Alb. Comparing the grade of reflux according to the International Classification with urinary ET-1, urinary ET-1/Cr levels in patients with grade 2, 3 and 4 VUR were higher than normal, and the ratio of more than normal urinary ET-1/Cr increased in proportion to the grade of reflux, but it conversely decreased in grade 5. In conclusion, urinary ET-1 may be an indicator of renal tubular injury in patients with primary VUR, and its meaning may be different from conventional urinary parameters."

CD010657,0,9002094,0,Urinary tract infections in young febrile children.,"UTI is a common and important clinical problem in infants and young children, with a prevalence of 5.3% among febrile infants seen in our Emergency Department. White females with rectal temperature > or = 39 degrees C are at particularly high risk (prevalence, 17%). Several studies have highlighted the limitations of the standard urinalysis for identifying UTI in infants and young children and have recommended performance of both urinalysis and urine culture. Alternative methods such as dipstick urinalysis, although attractive because of ease of performance, are inadequate as a screen for UTI. Hemocytometer WBC counts of an uncentrifuged urine specimen can be performed in an office or hospital-based laboratory with minimal training. Performance of Gram-stained smears, however, is most appropriate for the hospital-based laboratory. In the hospital setting where both tests can readily be performed, the positive predictive value of the combination of pyuria and bacteriuria (85%) allows prompt institution of antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available, whereas the lower positive predictive value of the single finding of either pyuria or bacteriuria (40%) justifies delaying treatment decisions until culture results are available. In the office setting where hemocytometer counts can easily be performed, culturing only specimens with pyuria and those of children presumptively treated with antimicrobials will result in the identification of almost all patients with true UTI, sparing large health care expenditures. Although the urine culture is traditionally regarded as the gold standard of UTI, positive urine cultures may occur secondary to contamination or in cases of ABU, leading to a false diagnosis of UTI. In contrast we found pyuria to be a reliable marker to discriminate infection from colonization of the urinary tract. The sustained absence of an inflammatory response, on repeat UA within 24 h, constitutes strong evidence that infection is absent. Management of ABU is controversial; many experts recommend withholding antibiotics because eradication of low virulence organisms may be followed by colonization with more virulent species that cause pyelonephritis. Preliminary results of our ongoing treatment trial suggest that management of young febrile children with UTI as outpatients receiving oral cefixime is as efficacious as inpatient management with intravenous cefotaxime. Results of renal ultrasound and DMSA scan at the time of infection have not modified management in any patient. Accordingly selective rather than routine performance of ultrasound is recommended. A voiding cystourethrogram at 1 month and a DMSA scan 6 months later have been valuable in identifying patients with vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring, respectively. Among patients initially identified as having acute pyelonephritis, the incidence of renal scarring at 6 months has been substantially more frequent (approximately 40%) than we had expected. However, the long term implications of small scars identified with renal scintigraphy remain to be determined."

Hydronephrosis is the most common urogenital anomaly detected, suggesting that an obstructive process may be potentially present. The goal of postnatal management is to identify and treat those patients whose renal function is at risk, while leaving alone the high percentage of patients who are at no risk of renal damage. This management involves a spectrum of radiological, medical, and surgical interventions for diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment.

A voiding cystogram was performed in all, complemented by either urography (147 patients), ultrasonography (65), or both (71 patients). In the latter group there was good correlation between sonographic and urographic findings, except for a more accurate delineation of renal scars and anomalies on urography, all in children with vesicoureteral reflux and/or abnormal sonograms. From these data we derived two imaging sequences tailored to the clinical circumstances: cystography as the initial study in ambulatory patients after infection has subsided, and sonography followed by cystography in children hospitalised with severe infection. The upper tracts are studied by ultrasonography and/or urography in patients with significant vesicoureteral reflex or an abnormal sonogram. Both these sequences reduce radiation by omitting the urogram in roughly half of the patients."

Among them, 111 patients had left ureteral stones and 65 had right ureteral stones, while 2 patients had ureteral stones in both sides. The stones were divided into upper ureteral stone (84 patients) and lower ureteral stone (94 patients) at above and below the iliac brim. 89% of the stones were less than 2 cm in diameter. Most of the patients were given lumbar anesthesia, and a guide wire was inserted into the ureter. The ureter was dilated with a ureteral bougie, and a 13F or 14F Storz ureteroscope was inserted. The stones were disintegrated by an ultrasound lithotripto and removed using forceps and a basket catheter. After the TUL procedure, a double J catheter was indwelled and removed within 5 days. The results were evaluated by DIP which was done 2 to 3 months after TUL. The success rate included residual stones less than 4 mm in diameter, as they could be spontaneously discharged. As a result, the success rate for upper ureteral stones was 53%, and it was higher for smaller stones. On the other hand, the success rate for lower ureteral stones was 85% and significantly higher. The main reasons for failure were the upper migration of the stones (60%) and inability to insert the ureteroscope up to the stone due to ureterostenosis and ureteral perforation (39%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010657,0,18278521,0,Antenatally detected urinary tract abnormalities: more detection but less action.,"We present the findings of a prospective cohort study of babies born with antenatally detected urinary tract abnormalities (AUTAs) between 1999-2003 and compare the outcomes with those of an earlier cohort born between 1989 and 1993. All infants with a fetal anteroposterior renal pelvic diameter (APRPD) > or =7 mm in the third trimester or other urinary tract abnormality underwent a detailed postnatal ultrasound scan and other investigations as indicated. The incidence of AUTAs was significantly greater in the more recent cohort (7.6/1000 vs. 3/1000 live births; p<0.05). Of the 350 infants on which we had data, 48.6% (170/350) were in the non-specific dilatation (NSD) category, and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was detected in 12%. Restricting investigations to those who had an APRPD > or =10 mm at >30 weeks of gestation could have reduced the number with NSD in the more recent cohort (26/115; 25%), but 25% of those with pelviureteric junction hold-up and 50% with VUR would have been missed. Significantly fewer patients in the more recent cohort underwent surgery (7 vs. 21%; p<0.001). There is a trend towards larger APRPDs on third trimester scans being associated with more significant pathology, but there is a lot of clinical overlap. The study highlights the need for cautious antenatal counselling combined with an assurance to prospective parents that postnatal investigations will be performed in a stepwise manner based on the initial postnatal ultrasound scan and clinical findings."
CD010657,0,11387151,0,Vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring in Chinese children.,"Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and renal scarring are commonly found in children with urinary tract infection (UTI). The prevalence of VUR and scarring may vary between racial groups. There are no published data on the prevalence of VUR and scarring in Chinese children with UTI. A retrospective, single-institution study was made of Hong Kong Chinese children aged less than 5 years with a documented UTI investigated by both micturating cystourethrography and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. VUR was identified in 39% of 93 Chinese children with UTI. Renal scarring was present in 28% of boys, which is comparable with published data on Western children. Scarring appears to be less common in Chinese girls with UTI (11%) than in Western girls (30-38% from published data), and its severity is poorly related to VUR grade. There is a significant dependency relationship between grade of VUR and degree of scarring in Chinese boys (p < 0.05). In conclusion, renal scarring appears to be relatively uncommon in Chinese girls. The correlation between grade of VUR and degree of scarring in Chinese boys suggests a relationship, but provides no evidence about the direction of causation."

A grade I and II vesico-ureteral reflux was diagnosed in two babies. Scheduled ultrasonographic examinations together with routine biochemical tests only are suggested by the kidney anatomical-functional normal parameters. Possible recurrent infections may be prevented through urine culture. Voiding cystourethrography is performed only when a recurrent infection is present because a reflux may be detected.

(99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed in 343 children with culture documented UTI (247 girls and 96 boys) aged from three months to 14 years (middle age of 4.82 years). The children studied were all those submitted for renal scintiscan to the Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Military Medical Academy, Belgrade during a five-year period (2000-2004). Micturating cystoureterography (MCU) performed in all patients before (99m)Tc-DMSA scan, revealed VUR in 213 children, while in 130 children VUR was not detected by MCU. In 15 of the 213 children the grade of VUR was I, in 88 was II, in 57 was III, in 33 was IV and 20 children had grade V of VUR. Findings of (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy were classified as: normal, equivocal and abnormal. Statistical analysis was performed using c(2)test. In all patients abnormal findings were detected in 38% (131/343), normal in 51% (174/343) and equivocal findings in 11% (38/343). In children with UTI and VUR the incidence of abnormal findings was 53% (112/213), of normal 37% (80/213) and of equivocal findings 10% (21/213). In children with UTI without VUR the incidence of abnormal findings was 15% (19/130), of normal findings 72% (94/130), and of equivocal findings 13% (17/130). The incidence of abnormal findings was significantly higher in children with UTI and VUR than in those with UTI without VUR (P<0.001). In children with VUR grades I, II, III, IV and V abnormal findings were 33%, 32%, 60%, 79% and 95% respectively. The incidence of abnormal findings was higher in children with VUR grades IV and V, than in grade I and II (P<0.001).

Information was collected from children visiting the paediatric outpatient department with a first proven UTI, defined as a urine monoculture with > or = 10(5) organism/ml, with clinical symptoms and possible white cell count > or = 20 per high-power field of spun fresh urine. Children with neurologic bladder dysfunction were excluded. VUR was determined by voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and graded from I to V. The diagnostic value of predictors was judged using multivariate logistic modelling with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC area). A risk score was derived based on the regression coefficients of the independent predictors in the logistic model. In 140 children (51 boys and 89 girls) VUR was diagnosed in 37. Independent predictors for VUR were male gender, age, family history for uropathology, serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) and dilatation of the urinary tract on US. The ROC area of this model was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87). This prediction model identified 12% (95% CI: 7-18) of the patients without VUR without missing one case of VUR.

CD010657,0,1929174,0,Vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring in children--a local perspective.,"This study was undertaken to determine the extent of primary vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring in patients investigated for urinary tract infection in the Singapore General Hospital between 1983 and 1988. The clinical profile of patients and possible clinical features associated with renal scarring were analysed. These findings serve as a useful guide in the investigation and management of VUR in our population. The incidence of vesicoureteric reflux among patients investigated for documented urinary tract infection was high at 32.9%. The mean age at presentation was 15.2 months. Almost all patients were less than five years-old. A male predominance was noted in affected infants. High grade refluxes of Grade IV or more (International Reflux Study Classification) were found in 45.7/patients and were associated with a higher incidence of recurrent urinary tract infection (p less than 0.05). Thirty-four 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans were done and 46.4% of refluxing kidneys showed renal scars. The incidence of renal scarring was significantly higher in patients presenting at an early age (less than 2 years), in high grade reflux and in recurrent urinary tract infection (p less than 0.05; p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001 respectively). Therefore all children with documented urinary tract infection who are less than five years old and especially male infants should be fully investigated for early detection and treatment of vesicoureteric reflux and renal scars. Kidneys with vesicoureteric reflux at risk of scarring appeared to be those with early presentation, high grade reflux and recurrent urinary tract infection whose management should therefore be vigorous."

The medical records of 120 patients were assessed concerning gender, presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), bladder capacity, detrusor overactivity, residual urine, febrile urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteriuria, constipation, detrusor sphincter incoordination (DSI), high detrusor pressure at maximal cystometric capacity (PMCC), low compliance, and thickness and trabeculation of the bladder wall. Renal scarring was diagnosed by (99m)technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (DMSA). Renal scarring was detected in 38 patients (31%). VUR, UTI, decreased bladder capacity, urinary residue, and trabeculated and thick bladder wall were associated with scarring at univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed VUR (P < 0.0001) as the independent risk factor for renal scarring. Thickness of the bladder wall was a marginal risk factor (P = 0.07). Although UTI was not a risk factor, it was associated with VUR (P = 0.03). In our analysis, VUR was the main risk factor; however, renal scarring was probably due to multifactorial causes, as VUR was associated with UTI."

Systematic voiding cystourethrography then is recommended. However, for 60% to 80% of the children, voiding cystourethrography is a posteriori normal. Moreover, it is irradiating, painful, and expensive. Thus, selective approaches are needed.

Twenty-four patients with NCDK disease and 16 patients with renal agenesis were studied in this 11-year retrospective study. In all patients the urinary system was evaluated by renal ultrasonography, and excretory urography or radionuclide scan. In addition, voiding cystourethrography was performed in 21 of 24 patients with NCDK disease and in 10 of 16 patients with renal agenesis. In those patients where voiding cystourethrography was performed, 14 (67%) patients with NCDK disease and 9 (90%) patients with renal agenesis had contralateral urologic abnormalities. Contralateral vesicoureteral reflux was the most common contralateral abnormality identified in 9 (43%) patients with NCDK disease and in 3 (30%) patients with renal agenesis.

CD010657,0,19498409,0,Management of duplex system ureteroceles in neonates and infants.,"Ureteroceles associated with the upper pole of a complete ureteral duplication are known as duplex system ureteroceles (DSUs). A limited knowledge of the natural history of this condition makes its management in neonates and infants controversial. Asymptomatic neonates diagnosed antenatally in the absence of severe hydroureteronephrosis (HUN) are at low risk of developing urinary tract infections during the first months of life. These patients might, therefore, begin antibiotic prophylaxis and undergo comprehensive assessment by 3-6 months. Subsequently, conservative management can be viable in patients without severe HUN or high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Cases of DSUs with severe HUN but no VUR can be treated by an upper urinary tract approach or by endoscopic decompression depending on upper pole function. Patients with preoperative VUR represent the most challenging cases. If VUR cure is considered necessary, lower urinary tract reconstruction is recommended. Endoscopic decompression allows for a definitive treatment in at least 50% of cases and, in the remaining cases, can be combined with conservative management or endoscopic treatment of VUR. Nonfunctioning or poorly functioning upper poles can be left in situ both in lower urinary tract reconstruction and after endoscopic decompression. Parental preferences should also be taken into account in the decision-making process."

Of these patients 86 presented with urinary tract infection and 27 were asymptomatic. A voiding cystourethrogram was performed in all cases and excretory urography (IVP) was done in 99. More abnormalities were detected by DMSA study when compared to scars on IVP. When both studies were abnormal there was an excellent correlation on a site by site basis. Fever or systemic disorder was not a reliable sign to determine whether there was upper tract involvement with infection. The incidence of DMSA abnormalities in infants increased with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and decreased with low grade reflux. There was no significant difference in the incidence of abnormal kidneys between the infected and noninfected groups, suggesting that renal scarring may occur with sterile reflux."

Half of the monkeys developed a decrease in renal function and were found to have interstitial nephritis. We found that this was due to a high resting bladder pressure, which affected the function and structure of the ureter. Thus, when a functional obstruction occurs in the refluxing ureter, renal function may be lost even when the urine is sterile. This situation is like that occurring in the patient with posterior urethral valves."

There was a strong probability that all of the babies had fetal ureteric reflux (FUR). Radioisotope studies demonstrated parenchymal damage in three of seven and reduced function in four of 10 refluxing kidneys. Subsequent investigation showed no increase in the areas of parenchymal damage but there was evidence that function in some kidneys had deteriorated.

CD010657,0,3034009,0,Neonatal hydronephrosis in the era of sonography.,"During a 6-year period (1979-1985), 142 neonates with significant hydronephrosis were seen. Seventy-eight percent of the cases were discovered on fetal screening during obstetric sonography. Maternal/fetal intervention was virtually never indicated and most babies were asymptomatic. The most common conditions found were obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction (41%), obstruction of the distal ureter (usually primary megaureter) (23%), upper-pole hydronephrosis associated with duplex anomalies (13%), and posterior urethral valves (10%). Seventeen neonates with multicystic dysplastic kidney were seen (three per year or one for every eight with hydronephrosis). In comparison, during the 30-year period, 1947-1977, 146 neonates with significant hydronephrosis were seen. Most cases were discovered because the patients had signs and/or symptoms--either an abdominal mass (an enlarged kidney or bladder) or urosepsis. The three most common conditions were obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction (22%), posterior urethral valves (19%), and ectopic ureterocele (14%). During this period, 53 neonates with multicystic dysplastic kidney were discovered (two per year or one for every three with hydronephrosis). The dramatic increase in the number of neonates found to have hydronephrosis is primarily due to the widespread use of obstetric sonography and concomitant fetal screening. The pattern of causes before 1979 represented the incidence of symptomatic lesions. The current pattern more accurately reflects the true incidence of congenital anomalies of the urinary tract."

CD010657,0,15173954,0,Current status of vesicoureteral reflux diagnosis.,"In children, diagnostic imaging for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) encompasses both radiologic and sonographic modalities.

In RNC the radiation exposure is significantly less than in VCUG with continuous fluoroscopy, but the anatomic details depicted are much inferior. With the introduction of pulsed fluoroscopy, the radiation exposure of VCUG has been markedly curtailed. VCUG is the first imaging choice for the urethra. The sonographic diagnosis of VUR with the intravesical administration of an ultrasound (US) contrast agent-voiding urosonography (VUS)-is being used increasingly in the routine diagnostic imaging work-up of reflux. Various sonographic reflux examination methods had been tried in the past. The real breakthrough came with the availability of stabilized US contrast media. Further impetus came with the introduction of harmonic US imaging. The recent release of a second generation US contrast medium promises to make a further positive impact on VUS. The diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced VUS has been found to be comparable to radiologic methods. VUS is primarily performed in follow-up studies and as the primary reflux examination modality in girls."

In case 1, a 6-month-old boy was referred to us for the management of recurrent epididymo-orchitis (E-O) complicating open drainage and a colostomy was performed elsewhere for a purulent rectal discharge thought to be rectal duplication. Diagnostic imaging showed a retrovesical cyst. Urethrocystoscopy showed a swelling of the verumontanum. No fistula was seen between the cyst and rectum on colonoscopy. At laparotomy, both ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles were found to be fused into a mass with cystic dilatation of the ejaculatory duct. Intraoperative histopathology of the cyst identified a metaplastic epithelial lesion. The cyst was excised with bilateral vasoligation. Since surgery, 8 years ago, urination and defecation have been normal. In case 2, a 4-month-old boy presented with fever and a swollen right scrotum. Ultrasonography showed a retrovesical cyst. Right grade IV vesicoureteral reflux diagnosed on voiding cystourethrography was treated by ureter reimplantation (Cohen) but complicated by recurrent E-O. Urethrocystoscopy with retrograde contrast via the utriculus showed that the cyst opened on the verumontanum, that both ejaculatory ducts opened into the cyst, and there was reflux into the right vas deferens. Right vasoligation alone was performed through a scrotal approach. Although the cyst was not excised, there has been no recurrence of E-O nor enlargement of the cyst for 6 years. Cysts of the ejaculatory system should be considered in the etiology of recurrent E-O in prepubertal children and a high index of awareness is recommended."

CD010657,0,7521215,0,Cortical kidney scan evaluation in the follow-up of children with vesico-ureteric reflux.,"We present the results obtained in the follow-up of 66 children with vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) of different grades (111 refluxing renal units, RU; the VUR being bilateral in 47 children), employing the renal cortical agent 99mTc-aprotinin (TcA). Together with the visual inspection of the scan, we adopted a quantitative approach, expressing the results as the split percent uptake of the injected dose. The detection of morphological anomalies was more frequent in the cases of more severe reflux. Scars were noted in 38 RU, with a higher prevalence in more severe grades, except for grade V where severe impairment was more frequent. With regard to the amount of functioning parenchyma, the probability of a significant loss of nephrons (expressed by a low uptake of TcA), rose with the grades, although the higher grades were not invariably associated with parenchymal failure. The abnormality detection rate is higher by about 2:1 with the TcA scan than with other diagnostic modalities such as i.v. pyelography or echography. No differences were found between RU with or without scars as regards evolution over time; only when the TcA uptake at presentation was lower than 10% was the normal development of the RU likely to be hindered. From these data it can be concluded that early diagnosis is the key factor in the management of these children with VUR; the morpho-functional assessment with TcA uptake is probably the most effective technique for the detection of parenchymal abnormalities. In addition, the test has a high prognostic value, an uptake lower than 10% indicating an unfavourable prognosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010657,0,24066006,0,"Interactions between cytokines, congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract and chronic kidney disease.","Fetal hydronephrosis is the most common anomaly detected on antenatal ultrasound, affecting 1-5% of pregnancies. Postnatal investigation has the major aim in detecting infants with severe urinary tract obstruction and clinically significant urinary tract anomalies among the heterogeneous universe of patients. Congenital uropathies are frequent causes of pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD). Imaging techniques clearly contribute to this purpose; however, sometimes, these exams are invasive, very expensive, and not sufficient to precisely define the best approach as well as the prognosis. Recently, biomarkers have become a focus of clinical research as potentially useful diagnostic tools in pediatric urological diseases. In this regard, recent studies suggest a role for cytokines and chemokines in the pathophysiology of CAKUT and for the progression to CKD. Some authors proposed that the evaluation of these inflammatory mediators might help the management of postnatal uropathies and the detection of patients with high risk to developed chronic kidney disease.

CD010657,0,9263417,0,Mild pyelectasis ascertained with prenatal ultrasonography is pediatrically significant.,"Isolated 'mild renal collecting system dilatation' (mild pyelectasis) is a common prenatal sonographic finding. An association between mild pyelectasis and fetal aneuploidy has been established, but in the absence of a concomitant anomaly, mild pyelectasis is usually regarded as benign and of no clinical consequence, and follow-up is often not obtained after the initial ascertainment. To test this, we investigated the relationship between mild pyelectasis and (1) progression to hydronephrosis; (2) postnatal vesicoureteral reflux (VUR); and (3) postnatal surgery. Between 1 January 1992 and 1 January 1995, we performed 453 prenatal sonographic examinations of 306 patients with mild fetal pyelectasis and no other anomalies. During the course of a routine sonographic examination, we performed a detailed evaluation of the fetal genitourinary tract, Mild pyelectasis was defined as a pelvocalyceal fluid-filled space with the smallest of two transverse perpendicular sonographic measurements of > or = 4 mm and < 10 mm. Hydronephrosis was defined similarly, but with a measurement of > or = 10 mm. Postnatal urological assessment was obtained with routine renal ultrasonography, and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), measurement of 99mTc-labelled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DPTA) mercaptacetyltriglycerine (MAG3), and intravenous pyelogram, as necessary. After exclusion criteria were applied, 294 (96%) patients with isolated fetal pyelectasis were considered. A total of 251 (82%) of these were followed with ultrasonography prenatally and during the postnatal period. Two or more prenatal examinations were carried out in 129 patients (51%) and in 35 (27%) of these cases the biometry progressed to frank hydronephrosis (> 10 mm). In only six (5%) of the cases followed prenatally did the measurement diminish to < 4 mm. We found a greater variability in prenatal renal biometry throughout gestation in infants found to have VUR, when compared with those who had no VUR. On postnatal follow-up, 84 patients had VCUG. Sixteen of these patients (6% of all patients [16/251] and 19% [16/84] of those who had the test) were found to have an abnormal finding. Whereas the prenatal appearance of mild pyelectasis improved in only a small number of cases, we found that it progressed to hydronephrosis in 27% of cases. Postnatal evaluation found VUR to be common in apparent uncomplicated mild prenatal pyelectasis. Although postnatal surgery was necessary in only a small number of cases, surgical intervention was necessary in 33% (four of 12) of those with VUR."

Renal function was evaluated with scintigraphy. There was reflux in eight of ten ureters. Six of these ureters had an associated urinoma and compromised renal function in the neonatal period. In two of the boys the kidney with urinoma functioned better than the contralateral kidney with reflux alone. In two other boys with unilateral urinoma the contralateral ureter did not reflux and the affected kidney functioned less well. In follow up (20 to 36 months) seven of the ten kidneys have a near normal appearance or function. Those kidneys which are now abnormal were noted to be abnormal in the neonatal period."
CD010657,0,6294943,0,Applications of nuclear medicine in genitourinary imaging.,"Major advances in nuclear medicine instrumentation and radiopharmaceuticals for renal studies have occurred during the last decade. Current nuclear medicine methodology can be applied for accurate evaluation of renal function and for renal imaging in a wide variety of clinical situations. Total renal function can be estimated from the plasma clearance of agents excreted by glomerular filtration or tubular secretion, and individual function can be estimated by imaging combined with renography. A major area of radionuclide application is in the evaluation of obstructive uropathy. The introduction of diuretic renography and the use of computer-generated regions of interest offer the clinician added useful data which may aid in diagnosis and management. Imaging is of proven value also in trauma, renovascular hypertension, and acute and chronic renal failure. Methods for the evaluation of residual urine, vesicoureteral reflux, and testicular torsion have achieved increasing clinical use. These many procedures assure a meaningful and useful role for the application of nuclear medicine in genitourinary imaging."
CD010657,0,22569439,0,Clinical outcome and follow-up of prenatal hydronephrosis.,"Hydronephrosis is probably the most common congenital abnormality detected prenatally by ultrasonography This study was performed to determine the cause and outcome of prenatal hydronephrosis in our hospital. A total of 45 infants, with 57 prenatally hydronephrotic renal units, were enrolled into this study. For the purpose of this study, the degree of hydronephrosis was defined as mild, moderate or severe. Postnatal ultrasonography was performed as soon as possible in those with bilateral hyronephrosis and 3-7 days after birth in those with unilateral hydronephrosis. Voiding cystourethrogram was performed in 6-8 weeks time. In the absence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), diethylenetriamene penta acetate scan was performed to exclude obstructive uropathy. There were 29 males and 16 females (male:female ratio 1.8:1), and unilateral and bilateral hydronephrosis were seen in 33 (73%) and 12 (27%) of the cases, respectively. Hydronephrosis was caused by ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) in 20 (44.5%), VUR in 10 (22.2%), ureterovesical junction obstruction in four (8.9 %), posteriorurethral valves in four (8.9 %), UPJO with VUR in two (4.4%) and non-VUR non-obstructive in one (2.2%). During follow-up, 16 patients (35.5%) required operative intervention while seven (15.5%) improved spontaneously. Fetal hydronephrosis needs close follow-up during both ante-natal and postnatal periods. In this study, the most common cause for hydronephrosis were UPJO and VUR. Also seen in this study is the noteworthy point that mild fetal hydronephrosis is relatively benign and does not require surgical intervention in most cases and surgery should be performed only if there is renal function compromise. Prenatal consultation with a pediatric nephrologist and urologist is useful in decreasing parental anxiety and facilitating postnatal management."

CD010657,0,8455245,0,Experience with duplex system anomalies detected by prenatal ultrasonography.,"We reviewed 39 neonates with prenatally diagnosed duplex system anomalies. Principal diagnoses were ureterocele in 15 patients, ureteral ectopia in 15, lower polar vesicoureteral reflux in 6, lower pole ureteropelvic junction stasis in 2 and yo-yo reflux in an incompletely duplicated system in 1. Several patients had other ipsilateral and contralateral urinary anomalies. Ten patients (26%) had relevant physical signs and only 1 became symptomatic, with urosepsis, neonatally. At initial assessment, before any accounted urinary tract infection, renal polar function as judged by radionuclide examinations almost always was severely impaired in the presence of major ureteral ectopia or severe reflux. By contrast, function was usually well preserved when there was obstruction, or lesser degrees of ectopia or reflux. A total of 19 patients underwent surgery (14 electively and 5 after episodes of urosepsis), while 20 have been managed nonoperatively for 12 to 84 months (mean 34) during which time the appearances and function of the upper renal tracts have remained stable. We conclude that the natural history of these anomalies is often benign and that a policy of routine surgical intervention, developed when most cases presented symptomatically, may not be appropriate in patients who present antenatally."

Associated genitourinary anomalies were common, occurring in 29% of the patients. Some element of hydroureteronephrosis was noted at initial cystography in 89% of refluxing renal units, but the degree of renal abnormality at 99Tc DMSA renography was not predicted by the severity of VUR. Overall, 60% of refluxing renal units were renographically abnormal. Although a high rate of urinary infection was encountered during follow-up, most DMSA assessments were carried out prior to infection and hence likely reflect congenital rather than acquired abnormalities. It was concluded that renal impairment associated with high grade primary VUR is frequently present at birth and not secondary to subsequent infection."
CD010657,0,2666935,0,Renal ultrasound and excretory urography in infants and young children with urinary tract infection.,"The main purpose of the study was to see whether excretory urography (EU) can be safely replaced by ultrasound (US) in children with urinary tract infection (UTI) younger than 6 years. 101 hospitalised children were admitted to the prospective study. They were all diagnosed as having UTI and were treated accordingly. All children had voiding cystography (VCU), EU and US done. US and EU correlated well in 94% of the cases. In all 6 cases with discrepancy between EU and US, the VCU was abnormal. Our results confirm the data from other authors, that VCU and US should be sufficient as an initial work-up on children with UTI, while EU should be done only in the cases with abnormal findings on either one or both of the former investigations. However, it should be kept in mind that some cases of parenchymal involvement or mild subpelvic stenosis can be missed using this protocol. If EU is obtained only in the cases with abnormal US and/or VCU, only 55 children (54%) in our group would have had an EU done."
CD010657,0,7732628,0,[The hazards and complications of internal drainage of the upper urinary tract].,"The causes, diagnosis, prevention and management of complications arising in insertion of internal ureteral stents have been analyzed basing on the results of 289 procedures in 272 patients. Dangers and complications related to drainage of upper urinary tracts (UUT) may be divided into technological (arising when inserting or removing the stent) and clinical (arising within the time of the stent location in the UUT). Technological complications emerged in 25 cases (8.7%). Of them, iatrogenic ureteral perforation occurred most frequently (9 cases, 3.1%). Clinical complications were registered in 41 patients (14.2%). Most common of them were: attacks of pyelonephritis due to vesicoureteral reflux and stent impassibility (19 and 9 patients, 6.6% and 3.1%, respectively). To ascertain the causes of the stent impassibility for urine, a complex of x-ray and ultrasound investigations was applied. The reflux is often provoked by the bladder drainage with urethral catheter. In the stent obstruction or concrement formation on it, the removal and changes of the stent were combined with extracorporeal or contact lithotripsy. Spontaneous distal migration of the stent (8 cases) necessitated its transurethral removal. Insertion of inner ureteral stents is rarely complicated by spontaneous migration of the drainage above the ureteral ostium (1 case) and by development of arterial-ureteral fistula (1 case). Thorough roentgenoendoscopical control over the stent insertion and staying in the UUT assists prevention and treatment of complications consequent to UUT internal drainage."

Recent advances in fetal ultrasonography sometimes allow an early diagnosis of renal or intravesical cystic structure to be appraised before complications (urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis, prolapsed ureterocele, recurrent orchitis, primary diurnal and nocturnal urinary incontinence with conserved micturation for a young girl). However, the basis of therapeutic rules remain unchanged, the superior pyelocaliceal system is not preserved in most cases of ureterocele with ureteral duplicity or ectopic ureter, because of major cystic dysplasia; although, in some cases when an earlier diagnosis is made, conservative treatment (primary endoscopy followed by a surgical intervention if necessary) can be proposed. Likewise, the endoscopic injection of Teflon causes the vesico-ureteral reflux to disappear in most cases (70%)."

CD010657,0,17684585,0,"Evaluation of dysfunction and malformations of the urinary tract in patients with meningomyelocele, by renal dynamic scintigraphy and direct radionuclide cystography. An Indian perspective.","Meningomyelocele (MMC) is the most common form of neural crest closure defect and may be associated with dysfunction and malformations of multiple organs including urinary tract. It affects as many as 2-4 in 1000 live births, however there are no epidemiological studies available from India. Anatomical and neurogenic abnormalities of the urinary tract are known to occur in these patients. Scanty literature is available regarding the utility of radionuclide procedures in the evaluation of urinary tract in patients of MMC. The aim of this study was to evaluate urinary tract dysfunction and malformations in patients operated of MMC by diuretic renal dynamic scintigraphy (RDS) and direct radionuclide cystography (DRCG). In this retrospective analysis, 140 operated patients for MMC, mean age: 4.46, range: 1-18 years; 83 male and 57 female, referred to our department for evaluation of the upper renal tract, were studied. Neurogenic bladder (NB) was associated in 69 patients. The diagnosis of NB was based on clinical features like incontinence, expressibility of urine bladder and on urodynamic studies. RDS was performed after the intravenous administration of 10.36 MBq/kg of technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetate or 99mTc-L, L-ethylenedicysteine. All patients with hydronephrosis (HDN) or hydroureteronephrosis (HDUN) on RDS underwent DRCG using 11.1-18.5 MBq of 99mTc-sulphur colloid. Our results showed that: out of the 140 patients, 78 (56%) including 33 with NB, had normal renal scintigraphy. Six patients (4%) had congenital renal anomalies. Twenty patients (14%) revealed non-obstructive HDN and had no vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). Thirty-six patients (26%) with bilateral HDUN also had NB of which 19 (53%) had VUR. Fourteen (74%) of these patients with VUR had impaired renal function. In discussion, patients with MMC may present with disordered innervation of the detrussor muscle and external sphincter, which adversely affects the bladder function and potentially threatens the upper urinary tract. Patients of MMC with or without NB can be evaluated with RDS for congenital anomalies and initial assessment of renal function. Patients with NB and particularly those with HDUN can be evaluated with DRCG for the presence of VUR to prevent renal scarring and subsequent impairment of renal function. Long-term surveillance of the urinary tract is important in the management of these patients and this can be accomplished with RDS and DRCG. In conclusion, in our patients with MMC, the tests of RDS, and DRCG could differentiate those with normal or our abnormal renal anatomy and function while the major group of patients had bilateral HDUN and NB, and/or VUR or impaired renal function."

CD010657,0,18491738,0,Vesicoureteral reflux and elimination disorders.,"Two kinds of elimination disorders can be associated with Vesico Ureteral Reflux (VUR): pure bladder elimination disorders or combination of bladder and bowel elimination disorders. An elimination disorder is always a factor which worsens the prognosis of VUR, as it increases the risk of infectious complications and thus presents a threat for the upper urinary tract. Regarding pure bladder elimination disorders, a chronic urine residue is observed in four clinical situations: the syndrome megacystis-mega ureter; the mega bladder without mega ureter, but with VUR; high grade massive VUR without a mega bladder; organic obstructions of the urethra (such as posterior urethral valves.). VUR associated with urine and fecal elimination disorders cover functional pelvi perineal dyscoordination, bladder sphincter dysynergia, disturbances of visceral motricity and anal sphincter function. The most characteristic type is represented by the neuropathic detrusor-sphincter dysfunction; also enter in this category neurogenic non-neurogenic bladders (Hinman's syndrome); However the vast majority of urine and fecal elimination disorders is represented by non neuropathic perineal dyscoordination associating at various degrees: voiding postponement, lack of sphincter relaxation during micturation, interrupted voiding, and constipation. The diagnosis of elimination disorders associated with VUR is based on non invasive investigations such as anamnesis and drinking/voiding chart in children and adolescents, and ""four observation test"" in infants. Ultrasound and uroflowmetry are also useful tools. Invasive investigations include mainly voiding cystourethrography and urodynamics, ideally combined in video urodynamic studies. The management of urinary and intestinal elimination disorders is based on the prevention of infections, the suppression of the post voiding residual urine and the treatment of an associated constipation. If surgical treatment of VUR is needed, it must be associated to the management of elimination disorders in the peri operative period. In many instances, an appropriate treatment of elimination disorders often leads to the VUR resolution."

This paper describes a possible means of detecting incompetent ureteric orifices during IVRNC examinations. In some patients a hold-up of material in the renal areas (stasis) was observed which suddenly cleared at micturition. A prospective study of 58 patients who had IVRNC and cystoscopy within 28 days of each other revealed that 76.3% had anatomically abnormal ureteric orifices on the same side as the stasis. This contrasted with only 12.8% of abnormal uretic orifices found in patients not showing stasis (p less than 0.005). As incompetent ureteric orifices are recognised as the major aetiological factor in vesico-renal reflux [4, 5, 6] this additional information gained at IVRNC could be of clinical use and perhaps avoid some cystoscopies."

Consecutive ultrasound (US) screening of 14,000 pregnant women detected ARPD >or=5 mm in 106 foetuses. After birth, two US examinations were performed: on the fifth to seventh day and during the third week of life. The findings were considered normal when renal pelvis dilatation (RPD) was <or=7 mm on both examinations and no other signs of abnormality were present. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was done in all infants 6-8 weeks after birth. One hundred and three infants were followed for 2 years. Antibacterial prophylaxis (trimethoprim 1 mg/kg per day) was given to those with RPD >or=15 mm, vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) grades III-V and suspected obstruction. In 53/103 babies, both US examinations were normal, three had VUR grade I. Two girls had UTI at 18 and 24 months of age, respectively. Among the 50 infants with abnormal initial US, six had VUR, of which four were high grade (IV-V). All four developed UTI. We conclude that UTI is uncommon in infants with two normal postnatal US examinations. Routine use of antibacterial prophylaxis in these infants therefore cannot be recommended."

CD010657,0,10656274,0,Reappraisal of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy for follow up in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,"We reviewed Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in order to assess whether repeated Tc-99m DMSA scans are necessary for the follow up of these patients. Ninety-seven children who were followed up for more than one year (1-7.4 years, average 2.8 years) after the first DMSA scan were included in the study. Fifty-one patients had been diagnosed as primary VUR and 46 as secondary VUR. Age at the first examination ranged from 0 to 14 years (average 5.1 years). Planar images were taken 2 hours after injection. The % renal uptake per injected dose (%RU) was calculated from posterior images. Kidneys in 11 patients (11.3%) changed morphologically during the follow up. Of these, new photon deficient areas (PD) were detected in only 4 patients (4.1%). All of these 4 patients had neurogenic bladder and were managed with self-catheterization. Of the remaining 7 patients, cortical thinning progressed in 5 patients (5.2%) and PDs resolved in 3 patients (3.1%). In one of these 7 patients, PD resolved in one kidney and cortical thinning progressed in the contralateral kidney. Of 97 patients reviewed, % RU decreased more than 20% during the follow up in 6 patients (6.2%). All were diagnosed as secondary VUR due to neurogenic bladder. %RU decreased only in the contracted kidneys at the initial scan. Two of them underwent renal transplantation because of severe renal failure. In conclusion, new PD rarely developed and % RU decreased in only a few patients during the follow up of children with VUR. Repeated Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy therefore seems to have little benefit in the follow up of children with VUR. It should be performed in selected patients with high risk of urinary tract infection or renal failure."
CD010657,0,10656271,0,Validity of 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake by planar posterior-view method in children.,"Renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA has been quantified by various methods. The aim of this study is to obtain a normal value for 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake calculated by the posterior view method and age variation, and to assess its clinical validity. Scintigrams of 238 children (0-12 years) with 99mTc-DMSA were reviewed. All the children had a clinical history of primary vesicoureteral reflux and/or neurogenic bladder, ureteral or urethral anomalies. Their kidneys were divided into two groups, ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" according to their scintigraphic findings and split renal functions. Percent renal uptake per injected dose (% RU) was quantitated from planar images at 2 hours after injection of an age-adjusted dose (26-95 MBq) of 99mTc-DMSA. Calculated total % RU, individual % RU of the right and left kidneys (mean +/- sd) in patients with normal kidneys were 40.7 +/- 5.0%, 20.2 +/- 3.0%, 20.4 +/- 2.7%, respectively. There was no significant correlation between % RU and age (r = 0.231). Longitudinal variation in the % RU in 9 patients ranged from 1.2% to 18%. Our conventional method for quantifyng % RU is simple, practical and feasible in routine clinical practice, especially for children under follow up."

Sixty-three of these children who had the examinations carried out within a 6-month period were assessed in detail. A DMSA scan is the most accurate method of detecting early renal scars in the young age group (0-2 and 2-5 years), followed by ultrasound. The examinations are equally sensitive over the age of 5.

Many complications and unsatisfactory results of the treatment of the above conditions depend on the drain method. NMUD and VUR were surgically treated in 85 children (age from 6 months to 17 years, 39 boys and 46 girls). Treatment results were analysed with reference to the drainage method--catheter stent or intubation by findings of excretory urography, cystography, ultrasonography and morphological examination with evaluation of a morphological picture of ureteral muscular wall, stage of the disease and extention of the upper urinary tract. Criteria of drainage method choice were determined depending on age of the children, morphological data, NMUD stage and degree of VUR. In NMUD stage II and III and VUR degree 4 characterized by manifest changes of upper urinary tract contractility intubating drainage is more effective. In insignificant changes of ureteral contractility (NMUD stage I and VUR degree 1-3) internal stent is a method of choice. Thus, treatment outcomes in NMUD and VUR depend not only on surgical method but also on the method of drainage."
CD010657,0,3883622,0,The management of vesicoureteric reflux.,"An increasingly large volume of data is being accumulated regarding the effects of vesicoureteric reflux on the kidney, data that influence clinical management. Although concrete guidelines cannot be drawn that will apply to all patients, important considerations include the following: All children with documented urinary infections should have a voiding cystourethrogram. The voiding cystourethrogram may correlate with probability of spontaneous resolution of vesicoureteric reflux. Younger patients have a higher chance of spontaneous resolution of vesicoureteric reflux. There is a definite familial tendency to vesicoureteric reflux, and patients with significant vesicoureteric reflux and scarring are more likely to have affected siblings. DMSA renal scanning is highly sensitive in the detection of scarring. Cystoscopy may play a role in the evaluation of the refluxing ureterovesical junction, but does not have as much prognostic significance as the voiding cystourethrogram. Urodynamic investigation may be important in evaluating children with urinary infections, reflux, and symptoms of voiding dysfunction. High-grade vesicoureteric reflux is associated with an increased incidence of renal scarring, and the answer to optimal management is not yet available. Most scarring occurs in infancy or childhood. Nonoperative management, especially in moderate degrees of reflux, can achieve a high rate of success. Nonoperative management requires continuous antibiotic prophylaxis. Breakthrough infections or lack of compliance with nonsurgical management have a high complication rate and must be managed aggressively. Antireflux surgery can be performed with a minimal complication rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010657,0,3062684,1,[Importance of echography in the study of urinary tract infections in childhood].,"One hundred and twenty-one children with a clinical diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) were examined with sonography (US), ivp and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). In 84 patients neither US nor radiographic findings were found of pathological significance; in 16 out of 37 patients with pathological findings both US and ivp were negative, whereas VCUG was decisive for a correct diagnosis. VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteric reflux in 10 patients, posterior urethral valves in 1 patient, and small diverticula of the urinary bladder in 5 patients. In 17 of the remaining 21 cases, there was agreement between US and urographic findings, whereas in 4 cases US provided us with false positives, with images of apparent renal scarring. The mistake was caused by an incorrect US detection of unilateral duplication of the collecting systems. The authors conclude by stressing the importance of ivp in the evaluation of urinary tract infections in children, even in case of negative VCUG and US results, and suggest comparing US measurements of renal length to the distance between three contiguous lumbar vertebrae in order to obtain measurements comparable to body growth."

In newborns identified with hydronephrosis during pregnancy or by neonatal screening, vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring are congenital and not caused by infection. Most of these patients are male and the vesicoureteral reflux is of a higher grade than that detected in girls having had urinary tract infection. In children with urinary tract infection, several authors advocate a more selective policy and recommend imaging only in those children who are at risk for developing renal damage. In adult females no imaging is necessary in cystitis, whereas ultrasonography and plain films are recommended in acute pyelonephritis. Because uncomplicated urinary tract infection in men is rare, diagnostic evaluation including imaging should be started early in order to rule out complicating factors within the urinary tract. The role of imaging in prostatitis, vesiculitis, epididymitis and orchitis is primarily to rule out abscess formation, but also to exclude testicular malignancies."

The M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen ( ATG) gene, the I/D polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE) gene, and the A1166C polymorphism of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1) gene were identified in 77 patients with primary VUR (aged 6.9+/-3.2 years, mean+/-SD) and 80 healthy controls (aged 33+/-7 years). Thirty-eight of the 77 VUR patients had low-grade VUR (grade I-III) and 39 had high-grade VUR (grade IV and V). Renal scarring was found in 43 VUR patients, while 34 patients had normal kidneys on dimercaptosuccinic acid scan. The ACE gene polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction and the ATG and AT1 gene polymorphisms were determined by single-step LightCycler technology. We found significant over-representation of the DD genotype in patients with renal scarring (44 %) compared with normal controls (23%, P<0.05) and patients with no scar formation (21%, P<0.05). Significantly higher D and significantly lower I allele frequencies were present in VUR patients with scarred kidneys (D allele 0.64 and I allele 0.36) compared with controls (D allele 0.53 and I allele 0.47, P<0.05) and patients with unscarred kidneys (D allele 0.4 and I allele 0.6, P<0.05). No differences in the ATG and AT1 genotype distributions and allele frequencies were observed in VUR patients compared with the normal population. The DD genotype and D allele of ACE may be a genetic susceptibility factor contributing to scar formation in VUR. We detected no linkage of genetic polymorphisms of ATG and AT1 to VUR and VUR-associated renal scarring."
CD010657,0,1433579,0,The detection and characterization of vesicoureteral reflux in the child.,"Voiding cystourethrography or radionuclide cystography should be performed in the child in whom it is important to know whether reflux is present. Voiding cystourethrography is more accurate in characterizing and grading reflux, and monitoring is intermittent. Conversely, radionuclide cystography uses a lower radiation dose and its continuous monitoring leads to fewer false negative results but its ability to characterize reflux is poor. The performance of voiding cystourethrography or radionuclide cystography to detect reflux is an art as well as a science. These tests are done best by those who are experienced and interested in imaging the urinary tract of the child. At our hospital we perform voiding cystourethrography in all young children with urinary tract infection to detect and precisely characterize reflux to enable intelligent planning of management. In older patients, when it is less likely that reflux is present but it is still desirable to ensure that reflux is not occurring, radionuclide cystography is performed. If reflux is present, then a decision is made on an individual basis as to whether additional characterization by voiding cystourethrography is needed. Radionuclide cystography is also used for family screening, for periodic followup of reflux being managed nonoperatively and to ensure that reflux has been eliminated after antireflux surgery."
CD010657,0,7715992,0,Acute pyelonephritis as a cause of hyponatremia/hyperkalemia in young infants with urinary tract malformations.,"Obstructive uropathy causes tubular resistance to aldosterone and severe metabolic imbalance may be precipitated by an episode of pyelonephritis. In the last 3 years we investigated 52 episodes of pyelonephritis (positive urine culture, elevated C reactive protein, fever, elevated neutrophil count) in 50 children between 15 days and 15 months of age. Ultrasonography voiding cystography and renal scintiscan were performed in all cases and i.v. urography in some. A salt-losing syndrome with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia (Na < 125 meq/liter; K > 6.3 meq/liter) was observed in 17 infants < 3 months, accompanied by plasma aldosterone concentration of 5000 to 23,000 pg/ml (normal value, < 1000 pg/ml). All these children had a severe urinary tract (UT) malformation (ureteropelvic junction stenosis in 7 cases, vesicoureteral reflux in 7, posterior urethral valves in 2, double system in 1). Thirteen infants < 3 months, 7 with no urinary tract malformations, did not have electrolyte imbalance. Pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 20 other patients ages 4 to 15 months, including 16 with severe UT malformations; 4 had normal UTs. We conclude that a salt-losing syndrome with tubular resistance to aldosterone can occur during pyelonephritis in young infants with congenital UT malformation, that the risk diminishes considerably or disappears after 3 months of age and that in the absence of UT malformation pyelonephritis does not cause acute sodium loss of clinical relevance."

By using renal scan with dimercaptosuccinic acid labeled with technetium 99m as the standard of reference, we documented acute pyelonephritis in 62 (66%) of 94 patients. Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 29 (31%) of the total group and in only 23 (37%) of 62 patients with pyelonephritis. Of the 70 E. coli urinary isolates, 48 (69%) were P-fimbriated, including 30 (64%) of 47 isolates from patients with pyelonephritis and 18 (78%) of 23 isolates from patients with normal renal scans. The prevalence of P-fimbriated E. coli in patients with pyelonephritis and vesicoureteral reflux was 46%, compared with 71% in those with pyelonephritis who had no concurrent vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0.222). Multiple clinical and laboratory variables commonly used in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis did not adequately predict the presence or absence of parenchymal involvement. These data show the following: (1) Acute pyelonephritis in the absence of demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux is common. (2) Febrile urinary tract infections in children are commonly associated with P-fimbriated E. coli, both in the presence and absence of vesicoureteral reflux. (3) The presence of P fimbriae alone does not fully explain the pathophysiology of renal parenchymal invasion by bacteria in the absence of vesicoureteral reflux. (4) The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children with febrile urinary tract infections on the basis of clinical and laboratory observations is unreliable."

This procedure allows a description of renal cortical morphology, split function determination and run-off evaluation. Signs of cortical scarring were found in 41 of 172 kidneys (24%) and were significantly associated with vesico-ureteral reflux (p less than 0.001) and with delayed urinary run-off (p less than 0.01). Split renal function was significantly reduced in kidneys with unilateral scarring (p less than 0.001). The radio-isotope investigations and intravenous urography were performed within 3 months of each other in 56 patients (110 kidneys). Good agreement between the findings was found except for 13 kidneys, where cortical activity defects were revealed by scintiscan despite normal urography. The extended scintigraphic procedure described is considered useful for urological screening of children with urinary tract infections and may thus replace urography as a first-line investigation.

The main issue is to distinguish those cases of dilatation which are clearly obstructive and need surgical treatment from those which are within the normal anatomical range. Out of 47 patients with primary megaureter, 23 were nonobstructive and these are the subject of our study. There were 16 males and 7 females. Thirteen were located on the left side, 7 on the right side and 3 were bilateral, adding up to 26 renoureteral units. Prenatal diagnosis was made in 16 cases, the oldest patient diagnosed was 9 years old. All infants were evaluated with ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, excretory urography and diuresis renography. The latter has been the most important test inducing us to adopt a conservative attitude. Differential renal function was more than 40% in 24 units and in 2 it was more than 35%. Diuretic renograms were type IIIa (dilated, nonobstructed) in 19 cases and IIIb (dilated, partially obstructed) in 7. There were 2 cases with vesicoureteral reflux in the contralateral system. We performed ultrasonography and diuresis renography during the follow-up. There were 8 cases with type I (normal) renograms and 17 cases with type IIIa. Only one patient developed an obstruction and was operated on. Differential renal function did not deteriorate in any of the cases. Urography was performed in 9 cases during the follow-up. All the patients have remained asymptomatic during the surveillance, except for 2 cases which presented urinary tract infection.

It was an important risk factor in boys over 1 year and in girls of any age. The risk of progressive renal damage in children in whom micturating cystourethrography (MCU) did not reveal vesicoureteric reflux was substantially greater than in those who indirect isotope voiding study (IVS) did not show reflux. The risk of deterioration for those in whom reflux was demonstrated was similar for both techniques. This discrepancy indicates an appreciably higher false negative rate for the MCU than the IVS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis detected by ultrasound was associated with a significantly increased risk of progressive damage only when associated with reflux, but most children with progressive damage did not have a dilated collecting system at presentation."

CD010657,0,9630038,0,Asymptomatic vesicoureteral reflux detected by neonatal ultrasonographic screening.,"Renal ultrasonography was performed in 2,384 healthy and asymptomatic neonates. The definition and grading of hydronephrosis was according to the system of the Society for Fetal Urology. Voiding cystourethrography was performed in the cases with moderate to severe hydronephrosis or persistent mild hydronephrosis. In cases with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan was arranged immediately to evaluate the renal parenchyma. VUR was diagnosed in 30 infants with a prevalence of 1.26%; 7 had bilateral VUR. The male/female ratio was 4:1 and the right/left ratio was 1.85:1. Comparing with the abnormal ultrasonographic findings, VUR appeared ipsilaterally in 23 ureters and contralaterally in 14 ureters. Using ultrasonography for diagnosing VUR, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 62.2%, 36.1%, 11.0%, and 88.2%, respectively. DMSA renal scan was performed in 31 refluxing kidneys, and congenital renal scarring was found in 9 (29.0%) kidneys. Six neonates underwent reimplantation surgery. We conclude that although ultrasonography is not a reliable tool for diagnosing VUR, it can detect many cases of VUR during the newborn stage using our screening program, which thus makes early treatment from the neonatal period possible. Whether our screening program can improve the outcome of VUR will require further follow-up."

CD010657,0,8129430,0,Renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis.,"Seventy six children, 18 boys and 58 girls, aged 0-15.9 (median 1.0) years, with acute pyelonephritis were prospectively studied with a technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan during infection and two months later. Fifty nine of these children were also studied two years after the infection. Seventeen children with a normal DMSA scan during infection or at two months after infection, or both, were not investigated by a DMSA scan at two years after acute pyelonephritis. A micturition cystourethrogram was performed in all the children after two months. Changes on the DMSA scan were found in 65 (86%) children during acute pyelonephritis, in 45 (59%) children at two months, and in 28 (37%) children at two years after infection. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in 19 (25%) children at two months. Renal scarring was significantly correlated with the presence of gross VUR and recurrent pyelonephritis, but 62% of the scarred kidneys were drained by non-refluxing ureters. Children with scars were older at the time of acute pyelonephritis than those without scars but no difference was found between the groups with regard to duration of illness, levels of C reactive protein and maximum white cell count, glomerular filtration rate, nor renal concentration capacity at the time of infection. It is concluded that renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis in children is more common than has been previously thought. Although children with gross VUR and recurrent pyelonephritis are at the greatest risk, renal scarring is more often seen without these risk factors."

CD010657,0,19999589,0,[Adult male with chronic renal failure due to reflux nephropathy that was possibly induced by neurogenic bladder since childhood].,"A 38-year-old male with impaired renal function and serious anemia was admitted to our hospital. He had suffered from a disorder of urination since early childhood and been diagnosed as having neurogenic bladder by an urologist when he was 20 years old. Since February 2007, general fatigue emerged and gradually worsened. In addition, he began to feel nauseous around February 2008. He visited a family doctor and was diagnosed with renal failure and anemia both of which were serious. H e was referred t o our office and admitted immediately because his blood test showed a serum creatinine level of 4.4 mg/dL and hemoglobin of 3.1 g/dL. The initial study with ultrasonograhy suggested that both kidneys contained multiple cysts for the most part, likely due to hereditary polycystic kidney disease. However, a subsequent series of diagnostic imaging tests, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance urography, determined that the cause of renal failure was most likely reflux nephropathy due to secondary vesicouretral reflux induced by the chronic neurogenic bladder. Moreover, the upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination showed that the cause of anemia was probably the persistent bleeding from gastric antral vascular ectasia. Reflux nephropathy emerges in early childhood and slowly progresses to chronic renal failure in some cases. According to the literature, it is not rare as a cause of end-stage kidney failure even among adult populations. Diagnostic imaging of severe reflux nephropathy is apparently similar to that of polycystic kidney disease. We herein present an adult male with chronic renal failure due to reflux nephropathy, the images of which were similar to polycystic kidney disease."

CD010657,0,16085971,1,Evaluation of the use of DMSA in culture positive UTI and culture negative acute pyelonephritis.,"This prospective study was done to assess the frequency of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in febrile children with positive urine culture as documented by Tc99m DMSA scintigraphy (DMSA) and the frequency of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in these children. Secondly, to determine the frequency of APN, in febrile children with supportive evidence for UTI but with negative urine culture, as documented by DMSA and frequency of VUR in them. Thirdly to stress the utility of DMSA to diagnose APN in urine culture negative febrile children and to suggest DMSA as a clinical tool in evaluation of fever of unknown origin (FUO). This study included 42 children with positive urine culture and 26 children with negative urine culture who had supportive evidence of UTI as determined by the predetermined criteria and diagnosed to have APN by DMSA. All of them had ultrasonogram (USG), DMSA and voiding cystourethrogram (VCU). They were followed up for a minimum period of 6 months. Out of the 42 children with positive urine culture 92.9% had features of APN in the DMSA of whom 82.1% had vesicoureteric relux (VUR). The DMSA was abnormal in 26 children with negative urine culture, of whom 65.4% had VUR. Ultrasound suggestive of parenchymal change was observed in 47.6% in the culture positive group and 65.4% in the culture negative group. In conclusion, it is suggested, that DMSA is a useful investigation for the diagnosis of APN in febrile UTI. DMSA is indicated in febrile children with negative urine culture but with supportive evidence of UTI and in FUO. An abnormal DMSA is a strong indication for work up for VUR."
CD010657,0,15095075,0,Voiding cystourethrosonography for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in a developing country.,"The primary causes of renal insufficiency in Albanian children are reflux nephropathy and obstructive uropathies. The poor availability and technical quality of conventional radiological imaging in detecting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and lower urinary tract obstruction stimulated this pilot study, with the aim of evaluating the diagnostic efficacy of voiding cystourethrosonography (CUS). The study included 34 patients (aged 0.1-14 years) with acute pyelonephritis, 7 of whom already had renal insufficiency. In 22 patients voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was also performed and a diagnostic concordance of 66.6% between the two techniques was found. Overall CUS showed a sensitivity superior to VCUG in detecting VUR, partly due to technical problems in performing the fluoroscopic examination. For the same reasons, VCUG missed 1 diagnosis of posterior urethral valves, while CUS correctly identified all 4 patients with this diagnosis. In 34 patients, CUS diagnosed 55 cases of grade II-V VUR and 11 urinary tract malformations; 12 patients underwent surgical intervention, some of them on the basis of CUS only. The follow-up of 31-81 (mean 53) months after CUS was completed by 94% of patients, excluding complications due to missed diagnoses. CUS was demonstrated to be a safe, reliable, and reproducible imaging modality without X-ray hazards that could be useful in developing countries. The potential limiting factors of the technique include the operator's training and experience and the costs of the contrast medium."

The role of VCUG is primarily to diagnose high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (≥grade III) (VUR) and hence prevent the development of renal scars and poor long-term outcome. We designed a protocol designed to reduce the indications for performing unnecessary VCUGs after a first episode of febrile UTI. In order to evaluate the efficacy of our protocol, we designed a retrospective study to verify whether high-grade VUR was subsequently being underdiagnosed."

CD010657,0,10953792,0,[Primary vesicoureteral reflux: report of 100 pediatric observations].,"In this study, the authors have reported 100 cases of primary vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) which occurred over a 7-year period. Patient age at presentation ranged from 1 month to 13 years, with a mean age of 3 years and 5 months. Overall, a higher rate of reflux was observed in the female population (63%) which was particularly evident after the age of 3 years, but with a male predominance during the first 12 months of life. In the majority of cases, the diagnosis of VUR was made following diagnosis and investigation of urinary infection (UI). A high level of UI was the most frequent sign of VUR (87% of cases), while in 6% of cases this disorder was diagnosed during the investigation of an uropathy which was found to be complex in all subjects. An analysis of 143 ureteral reflux units (URU) showed that VUR was pathological only in 17% of cases, and that the reflux grade was I, II, III and IV in 47.4, 28.14, 11.11 and 2.34% of cases respectively. DMSA scintigraphy in 38 patients showed signs of nephropathy in 24 cases, i.e., 14 scars and a decrease in kidney size in 9 cases, and an absence of fixation for one grade IV reflux. Forty subjects with 56 reflux units (34 grade I, II and 22 grade III, IV) were treated by antibiotic prophylaxis, with a positive outcome in 85% of cases in children under 2 years of age, compared to 40% for children aged over 2 years. Only 7 patients were treated by teflon endoscopic injection, and in one case a further injection was required; 21 patients with 30 reflux units were treated by surgery at a mean age of 4 years. In conclusion, VUR is a fairly common disorder, which is frequently detected via an IU; its potential gravity is associated with the risk of subsequent nephropathy."

CD010657,0,8510237,0,Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and hydronephrosis: is there an association?,"Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a common condition requiring surgical intervention during the first few weeks of life. The incidence of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis ranges from 0.13 to 0.4% of live births in the United States, Britain and Scandinavia. Associated anomalies have been described in 6 to 33% of the cases in the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and heart. An association of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis with urinary tract anomalies has not been previously documented. A review of 422 patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis revealed urinary tract anomalies in 6 (10 renal units), including 4 renal units with vesicoureteral reflux and 9 with hydronephrosis. This incidence of 1.4% is greater than the 0.2% incidence expected in the general population. This 7-fold increase in urinary tract anomalies in patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis suggests an association between the two and warrants further investigation. Serious consideration should be given to obtaining renal ultrasound examinations in patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis."

CD010657,0,16086170,0,[Modern ultrasound technologies and their application in pediatric urinary tract imaging].,"In children ultrasound plays a central role in the diagnostic imaging of the urinary tract. It is used most frequently and as a primary diagnostic option. Consequently, innovations in ultrasound technology and ultrasound contrast media have major impact on pediatric urosonography. Harmonic imaging is a modality that produces artifact-free images with high resolution. It has been shown that harmonic imaging is superior to fundamental mode in many urosonographic indications. Color Doppler is an established imaging modality, but its application for diagnosis of stones in the urinary tract, especially in children, is relatively new. The so-called twinkling sign, a color Doppler artifact at the site where one normally expects the acoustic shadow to be, enhances the conspicuity of the stone. A further development is three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound. It offers better volume measurement of the bladder and kidneys than 2D ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography has already proven to be a valuable alternative in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Thus, a significant decrease of radiation exposure has become possible as it replaces the radiological methods. With the introduction of contrast-specific ultrasound imaging modalities, further improvements in voiding urosonography are emerging."
CD010657,0,16252105,0,Clinical course of prenatally detected primary vesicoureteral reflux.,"The purpose of this study was to report the clinical course of medium-long-term follow-up of children with prenatally detected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Between 1986 and 2004, 53 (41 males) children with VUR detected by investigation of prenatal hydronephrosis were followed up for a mean time of 66 months (range: 6-200 months). Newborns were investigated by ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and DMSA scan. Follow-up clinical visits were performed at 6-month intervals. After 24 months patients were investigated by conventional VCUG or direct isotope cystogram. Survival analysis was performed in order to evaluate the resolution of the reflux. Differences between subgroups (mild vs moderate/severe reflux) were assessed by the two-sided log rank test. Thirty (58%) infants presented bilateral VUR, for a total of 83 renal units. There was a predominance of severe reflux (54%). Renal damage was detected in 33.7% of the units on first renal scan. There was a significant correlation between severe reflux and renal damage scars (RR=3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8, p=0.002). Forty-seven patients were treated with continuous prophylaxis. One patient developed systolic hypertension. Urinary tract infection occurred in 12 (25%) children conservatively managed. VUR resolution was evaluated in 56 renal units. Spontaneous resolution was observed in 25 units (45%). At 48 months after diagnosis, 75% of the cases of mild reflux (I-III) and 37% of severe reflux (IV-V) had resolved (log-rank, 5.6, p=0.017). There was an improvement of nutritional parameters between admission and the end of follow-up. In conclusion, the clinical course of prenatally detected VUR followed up on a medium-long-term basis is relatively benign. Our study corroborates the results obtained in other series of infants with reflux that emphasized the heterogeneity of this disorder."

Postnatal sonography performed in the first few days after birth confirmed upper tract dilatation in 39 kidneys (80 per cent) in 29 neonates and it was normal in 10 kidneys (20 per cent) in 6 neonates. Of the 6 neonates with a normal postnatal sonogram 5 underwent repeat renal sonography at an average of 2 months after birth, all showing moderate hydronephrosis (7 kidneys). Furosemide-enhanced diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renography was performed in 4 infants (5 kidneys) with ureteropelvic junction or megaureter obstruction, of whom 2 had persistent unilateral obstruction and underwent successful reconstructive surgery (1 pyeloplasty and 1 megaureter reimplantation). Two infants (3 kidneys) with nonobstructive dilatation are being followed while 1 infant with bilateral vesicoureteral reflux is being managed medically on long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis. Thus, 50 per cent of neonates with antenatal hydronephrosis and a normal postnatal sonogram performed during the first few days of life subsequently were found to have either significant obstruction (2 requiring surgery) or reflux. This study underscores the absolute necessity of followup sonography in all newborns with antenatal hydronephrosis that is not confirmed on the initial postnatal ultrasound."
CD010657,0,11211135,0,Usefulness of echocystography in the study of vesicoureteral reflux.,"The aim of our study was to assess the usefulness of contrast-enhanced sonography in detecting and staging vesicoureteral reflux in pediatric patients. Forty-nine children between birth and 5 years of age were studied for vesicoureteral reflux. Echocystography with the use of an endovesical signal enhancer was performed first, followed immediately by conventional voiding cystourethrography. The findings obtained by echocystography and voiding cystourethrography were consistent in 89 (90.8%) of 98 ureterorenal units (a ureterorenal unit is 1 kidney with its own ureter). Reflux was demonstrated by voiding cystourethrography in 13 cases; in 9 of these cases diagnosis had also been made by echocystography. Five cases of reflux detected by echocystography were not identified by voiding cystourethrography. With voiding cystourethrography as the standard of reference, sensitivity was 69%; specificity, 94%; positive predictive value, 64%; and negative predictive value, 95%. In conclusion, echocystography is a useful tool for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Its ability to detect reflux is similar to that of cystography in cases of high-grade reflux, and it may be an appropriate complementary technique to voiding cystourethrography, because it avoids exposure to radiation."

Introduction of the instrument is facilitated by the use of the Perez-Castro irrigation pump. This procedure does not lead to any urethral or ureteral damage, nor is vesicoureteral reflux shown on a postoperative cystogram.

CD010657,0,12244278,0,Urinary tract infection in childhood. Review of guidelines and recommendations.,"Children with urinary tract infection continue to be an important part of the pediatric practice. New uroradiologic imaging techniques like cortical radionuclide scanning and prenatal ultrasonography improved our understanding of the etiology, effect of treatment and outcome of these patients. Evidently, most kidneys at risk are those which already sustained intrauterine damage by obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux. It is the pediatrician's role to minimize ex-utero damage caused by bacterial infection by early diagnosis and appropriate intervention. The introduction of new potent oral antimicrobials limits the need for hospitalization only to the very young infant and the very seriously ill child. Whereas the roles of routine renal ultrasound and cortical radionuclide scan are debatable, all young children and select older children have to be investigated by cystography for possible vesicoureteral reflux. In children with vesicoureteral reflux, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is required in most children but in a few surgical correction might be indicated. Young siblings of the propositus with vesicoureteral reflux have to be investigated as well for possible reflux.

We determined the success of primary lower urinary tract reconstruction for nonfunctioning renal moieties and the morbidity associated with leaving nonfunctioning renal units in situ."
CD010657,0,11486419,0,Fetal vesicoureteral reflux: neonatal findings and follow-up study.,"To examine features of primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) at birth following prenatal hydronephrosis and to describe the course of congenital damage in the first two years of life. We reviewed the records of 382 patients with prenatally diagnosed dilated urinary tracts seen during a 15-years period. When fetal hydronephrosis was confirmed at birth, voiding cystography was performed. If a VUR was diagnosed dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renography, at 1 month of age, was also performed. Cystography and DMSA renography were repeated and 1 and 2 years of age. Of 382 patients with prenatal hydronephrosis, 68 (17.8%) had primary VUR (50 male and 18 female, M:F = 3:1). VUR was unilateral in 24 patients and bilateral in 44 for a total of 112 refluxing renal units (RRUs). High-grade VUR (grade > or = 4) was found in 70 (62.5%) RRUs, and 60 (85.7%) were boys. Grade V reflux was observed in 96.5% of males. At birth, 22 (20%) RRUs had moderate impairment of renal function. In 12 (10%) RRUs (grade > or = 4) was demonstrated by a severe decrease in renal function. In all cases no focal scarring was noted. Eight infants (all males), with grade 5 degrees VUR, in the first six months of life had surgical treatment. The majority of the RRUs (110/112 = 89%) were followed medically. Mild reflux (grade I-III) had resolved in 81% RRUs, severe reflux (grade > or = 4) had resolved in 38% RRUs. Serial renal scans during the follow-up showed no progression of renal damage. VUR diagnosed at birth on prenatal ultrasonography is associated with congenital damage, with males affected more often than females. In patients without infection, after two years, modification of renal function or renal scars are very rarely observed."

CD010657,0,1317065,0,Renal cortical scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis.,"Comparative clinical studies have shown renal cortical scintigraphy, using technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled glucoheptonate or dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), to be significantly more sensitive than either intravenous pyelography or renal sonography in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. However, due to uncertainties about the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical and laboratory parameters used in these studies, true sensitivity of renal cortical scintigraphy was unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of [99mTc]DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis of experimentally induced acute pyelonephritis in piglets using strict histopathologic criteria as the standard of reference. The sensitivity and specificity of the DMSA scan for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis were 91% and 99%, respectively, with an overall 97% agreement between the scintigraphic and histopathologic findings. Based on the results of this experimental study, we used the [99mTc]DMSA scan as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, and conducted a prospective clinical study of 94 children hospitalized with the diagnosis of acute febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). The aims of this study were (1) to determine the relationship among vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, acute pyelonephritis, and renal scarring, and (2) to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of the clinical and laboratory parameters commonly used in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. We documented acute pyelonephritis in 62 (66%) of 94 patients. Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 29 (31%) of the total group and in only 23 (37%) of 62 patients with acute pyelonephritis. The prevalence of P-fimbriae in the E coli isolates was 64% in the patients with acute pyelonephritis and 78% in those with a normal DMSA scan. Even in patients without reflux, P-fimbriae were found in 71% of isolates from the patients with acute pyelonephritis and in 75% of those with a normal renal scan. Follow-up DMSA scans were obtained in 33 patients with acute pyelonephritis in 38 kidneys. We found complete resolution of the acute inflammatory changes in 58% of the involved kidneys and renal scarring in the remaining 42%, including 40% of the kidneys associated with reflux and 43% of those without reflux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD010657,0,16639494,0,Cyclic contrast-enhanced harmonic voiding urosonography for the evaluation of reflux. Can we keep the cost of the examination low?,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a second cycle of contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (VUS) with no added contrast medium (CM) can increase the detection rate of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). One hundred twelve consecutive children with a mean age of 2.9 years with 224 kidney-ureter units (KUU) underwent two cycles of contrast-enhanced harmonic VUS. The first cycle of VUS was performed with 3.5-12.5 ml of suspension 300 mg/ml SH U 508 A and was followed immediately by a second cycle with only saline without adding CM. VUR was detected in 57 KUU from 44 children (39%) at the first cycle of VUS. Eight of the remaining 68 non-refluxing children (12%) demonstrated VUR at the second cycle (P=0.045). Most cases of missed reflux at the first cycle were grade II (75%). However, in two KUU from two children missed reflux was grade III. In one child reflux (grade II) was missed on the second cycle. Comparing the second cycle of VUS with the first cycle, concordant findings regarding the presence or absence as well as the grade of reflux were found in 94% of KUU. A second cycle of contrast-enhanced harmonic VUS with no added CM discloses significantly more cases of VUR at no additional cost for the examination."
CD010657,0,12536245,0,Radionuclide voiding patterns in children with vesicoureteral reflux.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate bladder function in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) by means of indirect radionuclide cystography (IRNC), and to investigate whether IRNC can identify those children with voiding dysfunction. The study enrolled 74 neurologically intact children, 14 boys and 60 girls aged 2-14 years, with VUR documented using contrast micturating cystourethrography as the initial method. In all patients, IRNC was performed using technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetate (DTPA). Based on the urodynamic findings, three groups were distinguished: a group with VUR and normal urodynamic findings ( n=27), a group with VUR and detrusor hyper-reflexia ( n=43) and a group with VUR and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( n=4). A control group comprised 64 healthy children, aged 2-13 years, without any symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction. The dynamics of bladder emptying were studied in the posterior view after intravenous injection of 37 MBq/10 kg b.w. DTPA, with acquisition of 90 2-s frames during voiding. The parameters evaluated were: voided urine volume (VV), bladder capacity, functional bladder capacity (FBC), residual urine, voiding time, average flow rate, peak flow rate (PFR) and ejection fraction (EF). With regard to the final urodynamic diagnosis, FBC, PFR and EF were found to be significant IRNC predictor variables using the logistic regression method. If abnormality on at least two of the three significant predictor variables was taken as the criterion of voiding dysfunction, the overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of IRNC in the detection of voiding dysfunction were 81%, 78% and 80%, respectively. Three radionuclide voiding patterns were detected in children with VUR: (1) a normal voiding pattern characterised by normal FBC with near-normal PFR and EF values, (2) a markedly reduced FBC with significantly reduced VV, PFR and EF values (in children with bladder instability), and (3) a higher bladder volume with a near-normal value for PFR and a slightly reduced or near-normal EF (in children with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia). This study confirmed the association between lower urinary tract dysfunction and congenital VUR. IRNC was found to be a simple, non-invasive method which allows reliable differentiation of voiding patterns in patients with VUR. IRNC can be used as a first-line method for screening in children with VUR to identify those with abnormal voiding patterns."

In addition, a 30-minute quantitative scintillation camera study was used. Comparison of these studies indicates that most periodic re-evaluations with IVP can be eliminated in favor of the scintillation study with its markedly reduced radiation dosage and lack of allergic type reactions. Unfortunately, as the quantitative scintillation camera study has been performed in these patients, it has been impossible to diagnose the presence of vesicoureteral reflux. Therefore, voiding cystourethrography or direct radionuclide cystography must be repeated at some time to determine if conservative management has been successful. The benefit of the routine use of the quantitative scintillation camera study in the early postoperative period seems to be strongly supported even by the small group of patients studied."

Scar formation on the nephrograms was detected in the upper, middle and lower zones of the kidneys on tomography exposures. Scintigraphic detection of scars was performed on the computerized uptake of the parenchymal phase. Maximal time elapse between the 2 investigations was 1 year. Excretory urography revealed 37 kidneys with a total of 74 regional scars. On scintigraphy 57 kidneys were judged to have 102 scars. There were 281 regions judged to be identical on the scintigram and the nephrogram.

In the case of high grade vesico-ureteric-renal reflux (VUR) or urinary tract obstruction the abnormality may lead to end-stage renal failure. An early evaluation and adequate therapy after UTI are mandatory. Between 1980 and 1987 we evaluated 63 children with VUR. The symptoms of UTI are variable and age-dependent. Only in 13% of the children the urinary tract was evaluated after their first UTI. In 70% of the cases there were more than 1, mostly multiple UTI. The remaining 17% were admitted for other reasons. The relation boys to girls was 1:2. In boys the diagnosis of VUR was made earlier than in girls: 57% of boys and 17% of girls in their first year of life. In 24% of the boys and in 36% of the girls VUR was found between the 5th and 15th year of life.

CD010657,0,12172759,0,Reflux nephropathy in transplants.,"Reflux nephropathy, renal scarring after urine infection, typically occurs in infancy. Although vesicoureteric reflux occurs commonly in kidney allografts, grafts have not previously been regarded as likely to be affected by reflux nephropathy, perhaps because older kidneys are considered to have matured out of the risk. Evidence that adult pigs remain at risk of reflux nephropathy challenges that assumption. We therefore reviewed the pathological findings in allograft nephrectomy specimens to look for evidence of reflux nephropathy, and sought evidence of focal transplant renal scarring in paediatric recipients who had a urine infection and vesicoureteric reflux. Consecutive allograft nephrectomy specimens (146) that had been removed between 1990 and 1999 were examined for evidence of reflux nephropathy, and relevant case notes were reviewed. Also, children with a renal transplant who had a urine infection were investigated for focal scarring by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning and for reflux with a cystogram. Four transplanted kidneys from adult donors that were removed from adult recipients had developed changes consistent with reflux nephropathy. Of these, 3 also had definite evidence and 1 probable evidence of a glomerulopathy associated with hyperfiltration due to reduced renal mass. All 4 patients had had recurrent urine infection and the 2 assessed had had vesicoureteric reflux. Two children with renal transplants that also had urine infections and vesicoureteric reflux to their graft were shown to have sustained focal damage on DMSA scan, confirmed as reflux nephropathy scarring on biopsy in 1 case. The grafts were aged 14.4 years and over 16 years at the time of scarring. Reflux nephropathy can occur in previously healthy adult human kidneys after transplantation. Previous studies of the effect of vesicoureteric reflux on renal allografts were not designed to assess the possibility of mild or focal scarring."

We identified children in the Northern health region of the UK who had been seen to develop scars, identified as new defects on dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scanning. Risk factors were sought by reviewing case-notes and interviews with parents. Twenty girls were identified whose new scarring was strongly associated with having both vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and a UTI (p = 0.0001); 19/23 (83%) of kidneys exposed to both of these factors developed scars. Children were much more likely to be febrile (94 vs. 30%, p < 0.0001) or unwell (82 vs. 10%, p < 0.0001) during their earlier UTIs when they were of median age 2.8 years (range 0.3-5.0 years) and did not scar, compared to their later UTIs at age 7.3 years (1.2-12.5 years), when they did scar. However, most patients were treated within 1 day of their symptoms for their early UTIs, compared to a wait >or=7 days for later UTIs (p = 0.001). Being febrile or unwell during a UTI does not predict the development of scars, but prompt treatment appears to prevent scarring in children with VUR."
CD010657,0,8747111,0,Resolution of vesicoureteral reflux during medical management in children.,"A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the results of medical management of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in infants and children. The charts of 105 patients (74 boys, 31 girls) with 167 refluxing ureters were reviewed. The age at diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 9.2 years (mean 1.3 +/- 1.9 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 2.4 +/- 1.5 years. We found that the patient's sex did not influence the fate of VUR and its complications. Patients whose reflux improved while being managed medically were younger than those who did not improve, and the younger the patient the sooner the reflux resolved. Improvement and resolution of reflux were also related to grade, and the lower the initial grading the sooner the reflux resolved. Spontaneous resolution rates of reflux were 92.3%, 76.2%, 61.7%, and 32.0% for grades I, II, III, and IV, respectively. No ureters with grade V reflux resolved without complications. The most common complications in our series were renal scarring and secondary obstructive uropathy."
CD010657,0,8414754,0,Rational use of CT in acute pyelonephritis: findings and relationships with reflux.,"Enhanced renal CT scanners were performed in 38 children (82% girls) to rule out acute pyelonephritis. Patients were divided in 2 groups on the basis of clinical presentation and bacteriology data. In patients of group A (n = 16, preliminary study), upper urinary tract infection (UTI) was certain. CT confirmed the diagnosis in all but 3 patients (a 2-year-old child and 2 patients with UTI developed on prior obstruction). In subsequently studied patients of group B (n = 22), clinical findings or bacteriology data were negative or questionable. CT made the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in 11 patients. As well as DMSA scintigraphy, CT scanner can help to diagnose or to rule out upper UTIs in difficult cases. In all boys of both groups, ipsilateral vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) was found by subsequent voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) on the side of pyelonephritis. In girls, this correlation was shown in only 7 of the 25 kidneys with pyelonephritis. This result supports the hypothesis of a gender-dependent contamination.

In group I the diagnosis had been made during the first 4 weeks of life, in group II between the 2nd and 12th months of life, after which treatment was begun. Statistical analysis of the patient data and results revealed clearly poorer results for patients in group I, who had the most severe congenital abnormalities: 10% of the infants in group I died within the 1st year of life as compared to 1% in group II. Among the survivors, 25% of children in group I had renal insufficiency as opposed to 8.2% in group II. The following parameters proved to be statistically significant risk factors with regard to prognosis: 1. Birth weight 2. Age at diagnosis 3. Renal function, particularly when initial creatinine levels exceed 200 mumol/l and fail to decrease below 100 mumol/l after successful therapy 4. Bilateral grade IV or V vesicoureteral reflux 5. Late incontinence (after conclusion of the 5th year of life). Statistical significance could be demonstrated for parameters 1-4, but due to the small number of patients not for parameter 5. The study showed that numerous neoimplantations associated with high complication rates were carried out in both groups, however, no statistically significant effect on long-term prognosis could be established. Our results did not confirm those of the Toronto group, who proposed that broadening the indications for supravesical urinary diversion would provide demonstrable parenchymal protection. No statistically significant relationship between therapeutic procedure and long-term clinical course could be shown.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010657,0,9404197,0,Can careful ultrasound examination of the urinary tract exclude vesicoureteric reflux in the neonate?,"The aim of the study was to determine whether a urinary tract appearing normal when assessed by meticulous ultrasound (US) examination may coexist with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and whether a normal US scan can be used to exclude VUR, thereby avoiding unnecessary voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). The US features of 35 neonates with known VUR were reviewed. Criteria studied included pelvic dilatation above 7 mm on a transverse scan, calyceal or ureteral dilatation, pelvic or ureteral wall thickening, absence of the corticomedullary differentiation (CMD) and signs of renal dysplasia (small kidney, thinned or hyperechoic cortex and cortical cysts); all signs that have been shown to result from or to be associated with VUR. 57 refluxing renal units (RRU) were found among the 35 patients. VUR was bilateral in 22. Among the 57 RRU, at least one US anomaly that would have prompted VCUG was present in 50 (87.7%). Pelvic dilatation above 7 mm was present in 29 RRU (50.9%) only. Calyceal dilatation was present in 24 RRU, the dilatation involving the calyces but not the renal pelvis in seven. Ureteral dilatation was observed in 15 RRU. Pelvic or ureteral wall thickening was present in seven RRU. CMD was absent in 32 RRU (56.1%). US signs of dysplasia were found in 19 RRU. No US anomaly was found in seven RRU (12.3%) in six patients. A careful and meticulous US examination of the neonatal urinary tract allows the detection of over 87% of RRU by showing at least one sonographic abnormality. It is concluded that a normal appearing urinary tract on US does not usually coexist with VUR and that in such cases VCUG is not necessary."

CD010657,0,14685837,0,Resistive index in febrile urinary tract infections: predictive value of renal outcome.,"In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we measured intrarenal resistive index (RI). We evaluated its ability to predict renal involvement as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In total 157 patients admitted to the pediatric department of the Sişli Etfal Hospital with clinical signs of febrile UTI were included in the study. The children were divided into groups according to their age at the time of ultrasonography (US). RI was measured from the renal arteries with Doppler US in the first 72 h in all 157 children. Renal involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after admission. The examination was repeated at least 6 months later if the first result was abnormal. All available patients with an abnormal scintigraphy underwent voiding cystourethrography 4-6 weeks after the acute infection. All patients with vesicoureteral reflux and scarred kidneys were excluded from the study. DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated abnormal changes in 114 of 157 children and was normal in the remaining 43 children. Of these 114 children, 104 underwent repeat scintigraphy, of whom 77 showed partially or totally reversible lesion(s). Of these 77 children, 17 children (22%) with vesicoureteral reflux were excluded. Thus, we compared the 43 children with lower UTI with the 60 children with definite acute pyelonephritis at admission. Kidneys with changes of acute pyelonephritis had a mean RI of 0.744+/-0.06 in infants, 0.745+/-0.03 in preschool children, and 0.733+/-0.09 in patients of school age with upper UTI. However, the mean RI was 0.703+/-0.06 in infants, 0.696+/-0.1 in preschool children, and 0.671+/-0.09 in school-aged patients with lower UTI. The mean RI values were significantly higher in patients with upper UTI ( P<0.001). There was a highly significant correlation between RI values and the severity of the renal lesion as ranked by DMSA scintigraphy ( P<0.001). When the cut-off RI value was 0.715, there was an 80% sensitivity and a 89% specificity for diagnosing upper UTI. Refluxing kidneys and scarred kidneys also had higher RI values. In conclusion, RI values were increased significantly in children with febrile UTI when renal parenchymal involvement (assessed by DMSA scintigraphy) was present. Our results also support the view that the children with high RI values are at a high risk of reflux, scarring, or both, which was frequently observed in febrile UTI. This might allow identification of patients at risk for severe renal lesions that require more aggressive therapy, investigation, and follow-up than those with lower UTI."

All were studied by paediatric radiologists on days 5th or 6th after birth by means of sonography and voiding cystourethrogram (VCU). Fifty percent had also IVP. No urinary tract disease could be found in 44 children, obstructive uropathy or cystic disease were diagnosed in 58 children and 61 patients had vesico-ureteric-reflux (VUR). They form the basis of the present report. There was a male-to-female ratio of 3.3 to 1. Neonatal ultrasonography was normal in 11 cases, 42 had pyelectasia (bilateral in eight cases) and eight had ureterohydronephrosis (bilateral in seven). VUR was bilateral in 28 cases, right in 16 and left in 17. Out of the 89 refluxing units, VUR grade was I in 11, II in 16, III in 24, IV in 14 and V in 23. There was intra-renal reflux in 17 units. Some other form of urinary tract disease was detected in 29 babies (47.5 per 100). Twenty-eight patients were operated upon and the remaining are under long-term urinary antisepsis with only five episodes of infection. The considerable proportion of false negatives for VUR in neonatal ultrasonography (30 per 100) and the high grade of some of these cases lead us to strongly advise routine VCU for patients with intra-uterine urinary tract dilatation."

CD010657,0,7802758,0,Mild fetal hydronephrosis indicating vesicoureteric reflux.,"The management of neonates with mild hydronephrosis diagnosed antenatally is still debated. Although some of these infants are normal, it is recognised that others will have mild obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). A prospective study was performed in all newborn infants with an antenatal diagnosis of mild hydronephrosis (47 babies, 62 kidneys) born over a two year period in order to assess the frequency of VUR. Voiding cystography in 14 patients with 21 renal units showed VUR. Two patients underwent surgery and the VUR resolved; the other 12 received medical treatment. Repeat cystography was scheduled for 12-18 months later, when a high rate of spontaneous cure was observed. The remaining patients were monitored by ultrasonography but only in one case did hydronephrosis deteriorate because of the presence of severe ureteropelvic junction obstruction. It is concluded that mild dilatation of the pelvis might be an expression of a potentially severe malformation such as VUR, and a careful follow up of these cases is mandatory."

For how long and in what way should they be followed? From May 1989 to December 2006, we prospectively followed 1,795 pregnancies in which the foetal renal pelvis measured 4 mm or greater. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and renal ultrasound were performed on 1,315 infants at 6 weeks of age. Our study group comprised 208 (167 male) infants with normal VCUG findings who had a renal pelvis of 6-11 mm. We followed them for 1-17 years (mean 11 years). Medical and radiological records were reviewed to determine any urinary symptoms and final outcome. They underwent, on average, four further imaging tests. The renal dilatation had resolved by 24 months in approximately 70%. Urinary tract infection (UTI) developed in 16 (8%). Calyceal dilatation was more likely in those developing UTI (P=0.02). Twenty-two (10.6%) had a radiologically demonstrated urinary tract abnormality. Of the five who had renal scarring or severe obstruction, four became symptomatic. Most infants with mild postnatal renal dilatation can be investigated with only one further sonogram at 24 months of age. Mild postnatal renal dilatation is associated with subsequent UTI or renal tract abnormality in 18%. Severe renal abnormality occurred in 2.4%."
CD010657,0,7794724,0,Update on dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scanning in children with urinary tract infection.,"The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan is a method for assessing kidney function. Indications for DMSA scanning in children with urinary tract infection (UTI), as well as timing, have changed. Pitfalls in interpreting DMSA scans include: (1) acute pyelonephritis (APN), (2) tubular dysfunction, (3) hypertension, (4) use of captopril in patients with renovascular hypertension and (5) duplex kidneys. Interpretation of DMSA scans in children with UTI vary according to timing and clinical setting. During the course of a febrile UTI a DMSA scan may reveal a normal kidney, APN or a non-functioning, small and/or ectopic kidney. In the absence of UTI (up to 6 months) in children with vesicoureteric reflux a DMSA scan may indicate a normal kidney, renal scarring (reflux nephropathy), occult duplex kidney and allows the progression of scarring and hypertrophy of normal areas of the kidney to be followed anatomically. The DMSA renal scan in now the most reliable test for the diagnosis of APN. The transient abnormalities due to APN can occur in normal or scarred kidneys. Lesions due to reflux nephropathy (defined as a defect in the renal outline or contraction of the whole kidney) are permanent. Intravenous urography reveals renal abnormalities later than the DMSA scan. If abnormalities are seen on a DMSA scan performed during the course of APN it is impossible to predict the outcome: they can progress to permanent scarring or heal completely. An abnormal DMSA scan during a febrile UTI allows the identification of children at risk of developing renal scars. These children should be carefully investigated, maintained on long-term quimioprophylaxis and followed."

CD010657,0,7794723,0,The intravenous urogram in the detection and evaluation of renal damage following urinary tract infection.,"Intravenous urography (IVU) still provides the most comprehensive structural assessment of the urinary tract. In particular, the radiological renal appearances approximate closely to the morphology of the renal scarring of reflux nephropathy or chronic atrophic pyelonephritis. It also provides reproducible renal measurements for follow-up assessment of renal growth and scarring. It is now less often used for first-line investigation of the acute urinary tract infection (UTI) because the swelling accompanying acute renal involvement is less easily recognised than the areas of defective function demonstrated on 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) studies. Also IVU contributes a higher radiation dose when calculated for full IVU (dependent on the number of films exposed) and there is a slight risk of side effects from injected contrast media, reduced by using non-ionic compounds. Because of its value in confirming such a serious diagnosis as renal scarring, suspected on ultrasonography or DMSA scintigraphy, modification of the technique of IVU with adequate preparation and the use of a reduced number of films, or single films localised to the renal areas, should be considered. Expertise in the interpretation of IVU must also be maintained because of the ancillary information regarding bowel and bladder function, the spine and evidence of stones, pertinent to the management of children with UTI and renal scarring. IVU and DMSA study remain complementary investigations."

In 27 children with VUR, UEBW was measured by transabdominal ultrasound. The UEBW in an individual patient was evaluated quantitatively using the percent deviation from age matched UEBW. There was a significant difference noted in the percent deviation from age-matched UEBW between patients (n = 17) with primary VUR and those (n = 10) with secondary VUR (p <.05). When analyzed together in 27 patients, a significant positive correlation (p <.05) was recognized between the percent deviation from age-matched UEBW and VUR grade. This was also the case in ten patients with secondary VUR (p <.01), but not for 17 patients with primary VUR. The measurement of UEBW might be of clinical use in evaluating the pathogenesis as well as the severity of VUR in children."

These recommendations were developed in the light of new knowledge that might influence existing guidelines. Regional, individual and local flexibility and variability should be preserved in order to make these recommendations applicable throughout Europe. They should help standardize dedicated imaging not only in terms of a quality measure to ensure state-of-the-art patient care, but also in forming a common basis for multi-institutional research. There is an urgent need for these guidelines in order to advance our understanding of the subject and to gain evidence and improve imaging efficacy. Our session worked towards establishing an agreement on imaging indications in common paediatric urological conditions, respecting the ALARA principle, and patient safety and care, and taking into account state of the art knowledge and efficacy aspects. We started the task with a reassessment of (1) imaging in urinary tract infection in infants and children, (2) postnatal imaging in mild-to-moderate neonatal hydronephrosis, (3) how to perform voiding cystourethrography, and (4) procedural recommendations for paediatric urosonography.

Bilateral pyelocaliceal hydronephrosis was detected by ultrasonography, and the patient was referred to our department. CT revealed bilateral hydronephrosis (right atrophic kidney), hydroureters and megacystis. Bilateral grade V vesicoureteral reflux, an increase in the bladder volume (> 300 ml), and urination without residual urine were noted by voiding cystourethrography. Uroflowmetry revealed that maximum flow rate was 21.6 ml/sec, voided volume was 110 ml, and residual volume was 24 ml.

All the patients were assessed throught a predominantly non invasive diagnostic approach which included: pediatric urologic examination with aimed anamnestic and clinical freaming, functional examination of the lower urinary tract using uroflowmetry + EMG of the perineal plane muscles (UR + EMG), kidney and bladder ultrasound. This methodology has permitted a widening of the indications in the study of vesical function as well as limiting the selected cases (hight UTI, uncertain diagnosis) of mini-invasive examination, such as flow pressure study, minctional cystourethrogram (MC) and or renal scintigraphy. An MNR of the lumbo-sacral medulla (cord) and a neurological and/or neurosurgery evaluation were only carried out were there was a suspected occult neurological pathology. The clinical sintomatogy was as follows: approximately 70% of the patients suffered from partial diurnal incontinence, 42% were affected by secondary nocturnal enuresis while 58.6% suffered from recurrent UTI. In those patients with UTI, 11% (16 patients, 24 ureteral units) suffered from associated VUR while 3.5% suffered from either congenital or acquired urethral stenosis. From the urodynamic examination, we determined the presence of detrusorial instability in 158 patients (64%) and lazy bladder or vescical hypotonia in 84 patients (34%). The suggested therapy foresees the use of: hospital home-based uroriabilitation (minctional biofeedback), endoscopic therapy (sub-ureteral bulking, urethral dilatation) and corrective VUR surgery (only in those cases that did not respond to medical treatment). The percentage of total recovery in patients with detrusorial instability was 80%, the minctional biofeedback both associated and unassociated with drug therapy lead to complete recovery in 66% of patients with lazy and uncordinated bladder, wile 26% showed improvement and 7 patients (8.4%) did not respond.

Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) are important because of their association with renal scarring, sometimes leading to long-term complications. However, the gold standard examinations are either a DMSA scan for APN and scarring, or cystography for VUR, but both present limitations (feasibility, pain, cost, etc.). Procalcitonin, a reliable marker of bacterial infections, was demonstrated to be a good predictor of renal parenchymal involvement in the acute phase and in late renal scars, as well as of high-grade VUR.

Adequate monitoring of RNP development depends on the frequent use of sonographical and scintigraphical examinations. In order to evaluate the accuracy of sonography in monitoring RNP 63 patients suffering from VUR (mean age: 8.8 years, range: newborn to 18 years, male:female = 19:44) were examined prospectively. We calculated renal size sonographically and compared our data to static and dynamic renographic findings. Our results showed a good correlation between relative DMSA uptake and sonographically estimated relative renal size (r = 0.95, P < 0.001), whereas not unexpectedly the correlation between relative kidney function and sonographically estimated renal size was poor (r = 0.83, P < 0.01). We therefore believe, that in monitoring children with VUR, sonography can offer accurate information on questions about renal size and renal parenchymal structure as well as pelvic distention. With very small kidneys as well as with kidneys showing severe dilatation and above all for evaluating renal function, scintigraphy proved to be the better method."

The art of observational inference of subtle anatomic features and function from a static radiograph is being traded for new, more precise, and more expensive modalities. While the superiority of these methods cannot be denied, the total information provided in simpler tests should not be ignored. The relationship between high grade vesicoureteral reflux with the dilated calyces arranged cephalad to a dilated funnel-shaped renal pelvis on VCUG and reduced differential renal function has not been previously described, but has been anecdotally designated a ""flowerpot"" sign by our clinicians.
