CD011926,0,12812349,0,Comparison of polymerase chain reaction methods for reliable and easy detection of congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection.,"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a potentially interesting diagnostic tool for detecting congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection at birth. We have compared the sensitivity and capacity of a group of T. cruzi PCR primers in detecting the complete spectrum of known T. cruzi lineages, and to improve and simplify the detection of infection in neonatal blood. We found that the two primers, Tcz1/Tcz2 and Diaz1/Diaz2, which target the 195-basepair satellite repeat, detected all parasitic lineages with the same sensitivity. However, the intensity of the amplicon was somewhat higher with Tcz1/Tcz2. For other tested primers (nuclear DNA primers BP1/BP2, O1/O2, Pon1/Pon2, and Tca1/Tca2 and kinetoplast DNA primers S35'/S36' and 121/122), either the intensity of amplicons varied according to T. cruzi lineages or the PCR assay was less sensitive. The use of the Tcz1/Tcz2 primers, which target a tandem repetitive sequence, requires a careful determination of the appropriate amount of Taq polymerase to avoid the formation of smears and multiple amplicon bands. The Tcz1/Tcz2 primers resulted in an intense 200-basepair amplicon with DNA extracted from blood equivalent to 0.02 parasites per assay when used with a simple DNA extraction method and of a low amount of Taq polymerase from a standard PCR kit. To better assess such PCR protocol, we assayed 311 samples of neonatal blood previously tested by parasitologic methods. The reliability of our PCR test was demonstrated, since all the 18 blood samples from newborns with congenital T. cruzi infection were positive, whereas the remaining samples (30 from control newborns of uninfected mothers and 262 of 263 from babies born to infected mothers) were negative. Since our PCR method is simple, reliable, robust, and inexpensive, it appears suitable for the detection of T. cruzi infection in neonatal blood, even in laboratories that are not equipped for performing the PCR."

CD011926,0,21918022,0,Diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes meningoencephalitis by real-time PCR for the hly gene.,"Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen that can invade the central nervous system (CNS), causing meningoencephalitis and brain abscesses. The diagnosis of CNS listeriosis, based on the isolation of the bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), can be difficult because of previous antibiotic treatment and a low number of bacteria in the CSF. To improve the sensitivity of microbiological diagnosis, we have developed a real-time PCR assay for detecting and quantifying L. monocytogenes DNA in the CSF. The designed primers specifically amplify the L. monocytogenes hly gene, which encodes listeriolysin O, a pore-forming cytolysin. The PCR assay for the hly gene (PCR-hly) provides reproducible quantitative results over a wide dynamic range of concentrations and was highly sensitive while detecting a single gene copy/ml. By assaying a large panel of bacterial species, including species secreting pore-forming cytolysin, we determined the specificity of the PCR-hly, which exclusively detects the L. monocytogenes DNA. We then analyzed 214 CSF samples from patients suspected of having CNS listeriosis. PCR-hly was positive in all cases in which L. monocytogenes was isolated by culture. Positive PCR-hly of the CSF was also obtained for five additional, clinically confirmed cases of CNS listeriosis for which bacterial cultures were negative presumably due to previous treatment with antibiotics. As a complement to classical bacteriological CSF culture, our designed real-time PCR-hly assay proved to be valuable by enhancing the rapidity and the accuracy of the diagnosis of CNS infection by L. monocytogenes. In addition, the quantitative results provided may, in some instances, be useful for the follow-up of patients under treatment."

CD011926,0,25404207,0,Comparison of detection methods to estimate asexual Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence and gametocyte carriage in a community survey in Tanzania.,"The use of molecular techniques to detect malaria parasites has been advocated to improve the accuracy of parasite prevalence estimates, especially in moderate to low endemic settings. Molecular work is time-consuming and costly, thus the effective gains of this technique need to be carefully evaluated. Light microscopy (LM) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are commonly used to detect malaria infection in resource constrained areas, but their limited sensitivity results in underestimation of the proportion of people infected with Plasmodium falciparum. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of missed infections via a community survey in Tanzania, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect P. falciparum parasites and gametocytes."

CD011926,0,8584311,0,Epidemiologic and molecular investigations of genital mycoplasmas from women and neonates at delivery.,"The rates of colonization by Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis were evaluated in 208 women at delivery and in their neonates. Mycoplasmas were isolated from the cervicovaginal specimens of 100 mothers (48.1%) and from the gastric secretions of 40 neonates (19.2%). The prevalences of U. urealyticum and M. hominis were 47.6% and 11.0% in women and 19.2% and 1.0% in neonates, respectively. Premature rupture of membranes was significantly associated with colonization of women by U. urealyticum (P = 0.031), and colonization of their neonates by U. urealyticum (P = 0.002) and/or M. hominis (P = 0.023). Forty-four selected strains of mycoplasmas were further characterized by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction. All strains of U. urealyticum belonged to the parvo biovar of the species. Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the similarity of strains isolated from mother-neonate pairs, confirming the importance of vertical transmission of mycoplasmas at delivery."

The diagnosis is based on serological tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against T. gondii, but interpretation of these tests results is often confusing. It is commonly made retrospectively when serological screening indicates a possibility of recent infection. Most women have antibodies against T. gondii and serial testing is required only in monitoring of pregnancies where initial screening is negative. The introduction of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay for detection of Toxoplasma gondii DNA in selected cases of pathologic pregnancies has permitted a more accurate and faster diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis infections."

CD011926,0,21367537,0,[A suspected case of in utero transmission of influenza A (H1N1) 2009].,A 34-year-old woman consulted the day before a scheduled caesarean for dry cough. A positive rhinopharyngeal sample for PCR testing for influenza A H1N1 led to a curative oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) treatment. At delivery a direct contact between the newborn and mother lasted only few seconds. The first healthy baby boy developped dry cough with a rhinopharyngeal sample positive for A H1N1. The minimal contact between mother and child and the positive neonatal sample only four hours after birth allow to think that it is a rare case of prenatal transmission of influenza A H1N1 to the fetus.
CD011926,0,23199494,0,Development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for sensitive and rapid detection of Cronobacter sakazakii.,"Cronobacter sakazakii is an emerging pathogen associated with the ingestion of contaminated reconstituted formula, which causes necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and meningitis in low-birth-weight preterm neonatal infants. Sensitive and specific detection methods are needed to better control C. sakazakii infections. This study aims to develop a highly specific and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for detecting C. sakazakii in powdered infant formula (PIF). A set of four LAMP primers were designed based on the published C. sakazakii ompA gene sequence. Specificity of the assay was evaluated using a panel of 22 C. sakazakii, 27 Enterobacteriaceae family except C. sakazakii, and 25 other strains. Assay sensitivity was determined using serial dilutions of C. sakazakii American Type Culture Collection 51329 culture ranging from 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL to extinction. The assay was also tested in experimentally inoculated PIF samples. The ompA-based LAMP assay was able to detect specifically all of the 22 C. sakazakii strains without amplification from 52 non-C. sakazakii strains. The detection limit was 10(1) CFU/mL in pure culture, up to 10-fold more sensitive than that of the ompA-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When applied to PIF, sensitivity was 10(2) CFU/mL, up to 10-fold that of the ompA-PCR. The ompA-based LAMP assay developed in this study was sensitive, specific, and low cost with great potential for future field detection of C. sakazakii in PIF."
CD011926,0,2725615,0,Use of the polymerase chain reaction for early detection of the proviral sequences of human immunodeficiency virus in infants born to seropositive mothers. New York City Collaborative Study of Maternal HIV Transmission and Montefiore Medical Center HIV Perinatal Transmission Study Group.,"The early diagnosis of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in infants born to infected mothers is essential for early treatment, but current tests cannot detect HIV infection in newborns because of the presence of maternal antibodies. We used the polymerase chain reaction, a new technique that amplifies proviral sequences of HIV within DNA, to detect HIV infection in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells obtained from infants of seropositive women during the neonatal (age less than 28 days) and postneonatal periods. In blood obtained during the neonatal period, the polymerase chain reaction was positive in five of seven infants in whom the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) later developed (a mean of 9.8 months after the test). The test was also positive in one of eight newborns who later had nonspecific signs and symptoms suggestive of HIV infection (mean follow-up, 12 months). No proviral sequences were detected in neonatal samples from nine infants who remained well (mean follow-up, 16 months). HIV proviral sequences were detected in samples obtained during the postneonatal period (median age, five months) in all of 6 infants tested who later had AIDS and in 4 of 14 infants with nonspecific findings suggestive of HIV infection. No proviral sequences were detected in 25 infants who remained well (mean follow-up, 17 months) after being born to HIV-seropositive mothers, or in 15 infants born to HIV-seronegative mothers. We conclude that the polymerase chain reaction will be a useful technique to diagnose HIV infection in newborns and to predict the subsequent development of AIDS. However, larger studies will be required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the test."

CD011926,0,18855654,0,HHV-6 is frequently detected in dried cord blood spots from babies born to HIV-positive mothers.,"Intrauterine transmission of HHV-6 is well established in immunocompetent women while few data are available on infections in babies born to HIV-positive mothers. To assess the rate of HHV-6 vertical transmission in comparison to CMV, we analyzed cord blood spots dried on cards (Dried Blood Spots, DBS) collected during a multi-center study on HIV congenital infections in Italy. DBS were tested by PCR for HHV-6 and CMV footprints. HHV-6 amplimers were sequenced and characterized. As control group, cards taken from babies born to HIV-negative mothers were analyzed. DBS of 187 babies born to HIV-positive and 372 to HIV-negative mothers were analyzed. The prevalence of HHV-6 was 3.2% in babies born to HIV-positive mothers. CMV was found in the HIV-positive group with a prevalence rate of 1.6%. In newborns of control pregnant women, HHV-6 prevalence rate was 1.1% (p=0.09), while CMV was not detected (p=0.04). Sequence analysis could distinguish between HHV-6 A and B variant in both groups and one A/B coinfection was found in a baby born to a HIV-positive mother. HIV-infected mothers transmit HHV-6 and CMV viruses to their babies more frequently than uninfected women."
CD011926,0,18588736,0,Effect on hearing of ganciclovir therapy for asymptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection: four to 10 year follow up.,"Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is the leading identified nongenetic cause of congenital sensorineural hearing loss. Most of the infections are asymptomatic but may be detected from umbilical cord vein and/or newborn serum positivity for human cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin M, and from urine positivity (on polymerase chain reaction) for human cytomegalovirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the newborn period. Children infected by cytomegalovirus may later develop sensorineural hearing loss. In symptomatically infected infants, ganciclovir therapy administered in the neonatal period prevents hearing deterioration. However, preventative therapy of asymptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus disease with ganciclovir is controversial, as side effects such as severe neutropenia may occur during treatment."
CD011926,0,23508918,0,"Association of the CT values of real-time PCR of viral upper respiratory tract infection with clinical severity, Kenya.","Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay of the upper respiratory tract is used increasingly to diagnose lower respiratory tract infections. The cycle threshold (CT ) values of qRT-PCR are continuous, semi-quantitative measurements of viral load, although interpretation of diagnostic qRT-PCR results are often categorized as positive, indeterminate, or negative, obscuring potentially useful clinical interpretation of CT values. From 2008 to 2010, naso/oropharyngeal swabs were collected from outpatients with influenza-like illness, inpatients with severe respiratory illness, and asymptomatic controls in rural Kenya. CT values of positive specimens (i.e., CT values < 40.0) were compared by clinical severity category for five viruses using Mann-Whitney U-test and logistic regression. Among children <5 years old we tested with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), inpatients had lower median CT values (27.2) than controls (35.8, P = 0.008) and outpatients (34.7, P < 0.001). Among children and older patients infected with influenza virus, outpatients had the lowest median CT values (29.8 and 24.1, respectively) compared with controls (P = 0.193 for children, P < 0.001 for older participants) and inpatients (P = 0.009 for children, P < 0.001 for older participants). All differences remained significant in logistic regression when controlling for age, days since onset, and coinfection. CT values were similar for adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus in all severity groups. In conclusion, the CT values from the qRT-PCR of upper respiratory tract specimens were associated with clinical severity for some respiratory viruses."
CD011926,0,10089054,0,Detection rates of TT virus among children who visited a general hospital in Japan.,"Recently, genomic DNA of the novel TT virus (TTV) was isolated from patients suffering from posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. We examined sera from 197 children who visited the Department of Pediatrics at Toyohashi National Hospital. Sera were tested for TTV DNA by seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a set of primers synthesized according to the published TTV sequence. Ten children were found to be positive for TTV (5.1%). All positive PCR products were directly sequenced in both directions using a fluorescent dye terminator cycle sequencing system. The sequences were compared by a multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The phylogenetic tree showed that two of the TTV isolates found in the present experiment did not belong to any of the phylogenetic groups previously reported."
CD011926,0,25410990,0,Reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and biofilm formation in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from blood cultures.,"This study aimed to correlate the presence of ica genes, biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance in 107 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from blood cultures. The isolates were analysed to determine their methicillin resistance, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type, ica genes and biofilm formation and the vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured for isolates and subpopulations growing on vancomycin screen agar. The mecA gene was detected in 81.3% of the S. epidermidis isolated and 48.2% carried SCCmec type III. The complete icaADBC operon was observed in 38.3% of the isolates; of these, 58.5% produced a biofilm. Furthermore, 47.7% of the isolates grew on vancomycin screen agar, with an increase in the MIC in 75.9% of the isolates. Determination of the MIC of subpopulations revealed that 64.7% had an MIC ≥ 4 μg mL-1, including 15.7% with an MIC of 8 μg mL-1 and 2% with an MIC of 16 μg mL-1. The presence of the icaADBC operon, biofilm production and reduced susceptibility to vancomycin were associated with methicillin resistance. This study reveals a high level of methicillin resistance, biofilm formation and reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in subpopulations of S. epidermidis. These findings may explain the selection of multidrug-resistant isolates in hospital settings and the consequent failure of antimicrobial treatment."

We present a nationwide, retrospective cohort study on the outcome of cCMV up to age 6 years. For this study we identified cCMV, using polymerase chain reaction, by analysing dried blood spots, which are taken shortly after birth for neonatal screening. The group of children with cCMV were compared to a group of children who were cCMV negative at birth. Data were collected about their health and development up to age 6 years. Parents of 73 693 children were invited to participate, and 32 486 (44·1%) gave informed consent for testing of their child's dried blood spot for CMV. Of the 31 484 dried blood spots tested, 156 (0·5%) were positive for cCMV. Of these, four (2·6%) children had been diagnosed with cCMV prior to this study. This unique retrospective nationwide study permits the estimation of long-term sequelae of cCMV up to the age of 6 years. The birth prevalence of cCMV in this study was 0·5%, which is in line with prior estimates. Most (97·4%) children with cCMV had not been diagnosed earlier, indicating under-diagnosis of cCMV."
CD011926,0,25261066,0,Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia: independent risk factors for mortality and impact of resistance on outcome.,"The rates of multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant and pandrug-resistant isolates amongst non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have risen worldwide. The clinical consequence of resistance and the impact of adverse treatment on the outcome of patients with P. aeruginosa bacteraemia remain unclear. To better understand the predictors of mortality, the clinical consequence of resistance and the impact of inappropriate therapy on patient outcomes, we analysed the first episode of P. aeruginosa bacteraemia in patients from a Brazilian tertiary-care hospital during the period from May 2009 to August 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted; phenotypic detection of metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) and PCR of MBL genes were performed on carbapenem-resistant strains. Amongst the 120 P. aeruginosa isolates, 45.8 % were resistant to carbapenem and 36 strains were tested for MBL detection. A total of 30 % were phenotypically positive and, of these, 77.8 % expressed an MBL gene, bla(SPM-1) (57 %) and bla(VIM-type) (43 %). The resistance rates to ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenem, fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside were 55, 42.5, 35, 45.8, 44 and 44 %, respectively. Previous antibiotic use, length of a hospital stay ≥30 days prior to P. aeruginosa, haemodialysis, tracheostomy, pulmonary source of bacteraemia and Intensive Care Unit admission were common independent risk factors for antimicrobial resistance. Cefepime resistance, multidrug resistance and extensive drug resistance were independently associated with inappropriate therapy, which was an important predictor of mortality, being synergistic with the severity of the underlying disease."

CD011926,0,12183142,0,Clinical and epidemiological aspects of an enterovirus outbreak in a neonatal unit.,"An outbreak of enterovirus infection occurred among neonates in a maternity hospital between July 7 and 22, 1999. Twenty neonates became ill (18 confirmed and two probable), an attack rate of 33%. The incubation period ranged from three to six days (mean, 4.2). The male:female ratio was 11:9 and the mean age at the onset of illness was 5.5 days. All the babies had fever, eight, a maculopapular rash, and six had symptoms of gastroenteritis, 11 developed meningitis. Nineteen neonates required hospitalization for three to seven days, but all were discharged home without sequelae. Enteroviral RNA was detected in all of 18 urines, and 14 cerebrospinal fluid specimens tested. A case-control study was conducted to determine risk factors associated with the outbreak. Rooming in the nursery ward was a significant risk factor (odds ratio=33.35; 95% confidence interval, 3.79-800; P=0.00002). No association was found between illness and other possible risk factors. Appropriate control measures resulted in resolution of the outbreak. Our findings demonstrate the potential for enteroviruses to cause widespread illness among newborns, and emphasize the usefulness of polymerase chain reaction in the early diagnosis of infection, and underline the role of effective control measures in interrupting viral transmission."

We investigated 389 P. aeruginosa isolates, collected from 29 hospitals in the Tohoku area of Japan, to determine their susceptibilities to ten antimicrobial drugs, and the rates of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa among them. Two hundred and one P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from small (group S)hospitals that had adopted imipenem as a carbapenem antibiotic, and 188 were isolated from general (group G) hospitals, which employed three or four carbapenems. MBL genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all isolates for which the sodium mercaptoacetic acid (SMA) disk method gave positive results. The antimicrobial agents tested were imipenem, meropenem, biapenem, panipenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, sulbactam/cefoperazone, amikacin, arbekacin, and ciprofloxacin. Sixteen (8.0%) of the 201 isolates from group S hospitals and three (1.6%) of the 188 isolates from group G hospitals were MBL-producing P. aeruginosa. In this study, the proportion of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa in group S was significantly higher than that found in group G (P < 0.01). The use of only one agent as a carbapenem antibiotic may have been one of the factors contributing to the high detection rate of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa observed in group S hospitals."

CD011926,0,23352717,0,[The Spanish Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis].,"Congenital toxoplasmosis is the result of transplacental fetal infection by Toxoplasma gondii after the primary maternal infection. The severity of the disease depends on the gestational age at transmission. First trimester infections are more severe, but less frequent, than third trimester infections. Acute maternal infection is diagnosed by seroconversion or by the detection of IgM antibodies and a low IgG avidity test. In these cases, spiramycin should be initiated to prevent transmission to the fetus. For identification of fetal infection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of amniotic fluid after 18 weeks gestation should be performed. If fetal infection is confirmed, the mothers should be treated with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine and folinic acid. Most infants infected in utero are born with no obvious signs of toxoplasmosis, but up to 80% developed learning and visual disabilities later in life. Neonatal diagnosis with IgM/IgA antibodies or blood/cerebrospinal fluid PCR may be difficult because false-negative results frequently occur. In these cases diagnosis is possible by demonstrating a rise in IgG titers during follow-up or by the detection of antibodies beyond one year of age. Early treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine may improve the ophthalmologic and neurological outcome. Congenital toxoplasmosis is a preventable disease. Pre-pregnancy screening and appropriate counseling regarding prevention measures in seronegative women may prevent fetal infection."

CD011926,0,10702722,0,New advances in the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus infection.,"With the advances in anticytomegalovirus (anti-CMV) serology, the new recombinant IgM tests seem likely to become the screening tests for pregnant women whose prepregnancy serological status for CMV is unknown. When a woman is found to be IgM-positive, further diagnostic evaluation focused on determining whether this is due to a primary infection should be carried out. Maternal primary infections that were difficult to determine until a few years ago unless documented by seroconversion can now be readily diagnosed from the presence of low-avidity anti-CMV antibody which persists for approximately 20 weeks after primary infection. In primarily infected mothers prenatal diagnosis can be performed between 21 and 23 weeks of gestation, and the amniotic fluid (AF) represents the pathological material of choice to determine intrauterine virus transmission. In AF, the virus can be detected by culture and/or PCR. Both procedures differentiate uninfected from infected fetuses, but cannot predict fetal outcome. The determination of the viral load in AF carried out by quantitative PCR is more promising and could represent an important starting point for preemptive fetal therapy."

CD011926,0,23515552,0,Characterization of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli strains involved in maternal-fetal colonization: prevalence of E. coli ST131.,"Maternal-fetal Escherichia coli infections, such as neonatal bacteremia and meningitis, are important causes of morbidity and mortality. From 2006 to 2010, we studied newborns and their mothers who were colonized with E. coli in a French hospital in order to document (i) the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli strains, (ii) the prevalence of associated virulence genes, (iii) the prevalence of clone sequence type 131 (ST131), and (iv) the genetic relationship among ESBL-producing strains. Among the 2,755 E. coli cultures recovered from vaginal or neonatal samples, 68 were ESBL producers (2.46%). We found a wide diversity of ESBL genes, with the majority being bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-1), and bla(CTX-M-15), distributed among the 4 main phylogenetic groups. Genes encoding virulence factors were found in 90.7% of the isolates, with ≥ 2 virulence genes present in 76% of cases. The prevalence of ST131 among ESBL-producing E. coli isolates was 9.4% (6/64). Five of these 6 ST131 isolates possessed bla(CTX-M-15) enzymes (and also were resistant to quinolones), and one possessed bla(CTX-M-2) enzymes. Two possessed virulence genes, suggesting the presence of pathogenicity island IIJ96 (PAI IIJ96)-like domains. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed a high level of genomic diversity overall, except for 3 closely related isolates belonging to clonal group ST131. Repetitive PCR showed that the six ST131 isolates were closely related to ST131 control strains (>95% similarity). This study shows a high prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli strains and clonal group ST131 in the French maternal-fetal population. These results suggest a widespread distribution of ESBL enzymes in the community and highlight the early transmission between mothers and neonates. These findings are worrisome, especially for this particularly vulnerable population."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotype diversity of HAstV in children with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil. From June 1997 to July 1999 a total of 183 fecal samples 84 from symptomatic and 99 from asymptomatic children were tested by enzyme immunoassay for HAstV. Prevalence rates were found to be 11 and 3% for symptomatic and asymptomatic children, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out in 46 specimens (26 symptomatic and 20 asymptomatic) including the 12 samples that were positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The overall positivity yielded by both methods was 8% (15/184); of these, 11% (9/84) for symptomatic and 5% (5/99) for those without symptoms or signs. Sequence analysis of amplicons revealed that HAstV-1 genotype was the most prevalent, accounting for 60% of isolates. Genotypes 2, 3, 4, and 5 were also detected, as one single isolate (10%) for each type. Variations in the sequences were observed when Brazilian isolates were compared to prototype strains identified in the United Kingdom. No seasonal pattern of occurrence was observed during these two years of study, and peak detection rate was observed in children aged between 3 and 6 months in the symptomatic group, and between 18 and 24 months in the controls."

Total nucleic acids from pediatric clinical samples (n = 653) and an hMPV-specific inhibition control (h-IC) were coextracted using the MM and/or the EM. Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and real-time molecular beacon detection of hMPV were performed using a NucliSENS EasyQ analyzer (bioMérieux). Positive results were confirmed using an in-house-validated reverse transcriptase PCR ASR-based assay. The inclusion of the h-IC monitored the entire process, including the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection. The percentages of samples with inhibited amplification of the h-IC after initial NA extraction by EM and MM were 1.88% and 3.17%, respectively. After reprocessing of a new aliquot, the final h-IC inhibition rates were 0% (EM) and 1.06% (MM). The limit of detection of the assay was between 2 (EM extraction) and 10 (MM extraction) RNA copies/reaction, and specificity was 100% when testing viral respiratory isolates and clinical samples. hMPV was detected in 5.6% of pediatric samples tested and was also detected in three coinfections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). hMPV was the second most frequently detected respiratory virus in children of 0 to 2 years of age, after RSV. In summary, NucliSENS extraction and ASRs provided a sensitive and specific method for the detection of hMPV in respiratory samples."

CD011926,0,11503357,0,[Prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis in France. Risk assessment. Results and perspectives of prenatal screening and newborn follow up].,"In France, a national program for the prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis has been set up 25 years ago. This program is here presented and discussed in details. It is based on a decision tree well defined, with pre and/or per gravidic serological screening with several different tests, completed, if necessary, by ultrasounds examinations of the fetus, biomolecular tests (PCR) on amniotic fluid, and by clinical, biological, and radiological surveillance of neo-nates. The purpose of this prevention program is to: 1/identify nonimmune young women and limit their contamination risk during pregnancy by appropriate counseling on hygiene and diet; 2/screen and treat per gravidic toxoplasmosis as early as possible so as to prevent or limit transmission to the fetus and its consequences. 3/in utero diagnose and treat infestation of the fetus; 4/diagnose and treat asymptomatic congenital toxoplasmosis in neonates, to prevent risks of reactivation and late complications, especially ocular. Such a prevention program has a cost validated by the prevalence of acquired toxoplasmosis in adults in France (over 50% of the population) and by the yearly incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis (at least 0.1% of births according to the best hypothesis). These 6 to 700 congenital toxoplasmosis cases per year may be compared to the 6 to 7,000 per gravidic seroconversions which could lead to fetal contamination if no preventive measures are taken. Nevertheless, as it is often the case in the field of prevention, it is very difficult to statistically assess the efficacy of this program even though several arguments show that it allows to eliminate the most serious toxoplasmosis, sources of serious handicaps at birth, and to limit the frequency of late complications (especially retino-choroiditis) of asymptomatic infections in neonates. The position of European countries varies as to prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis. Some countries (Austria, Belgium) have national prevention programs similar to the French one, whereas others have set up only limited programs or set up no systematic prevention. These differences may be accounted for by the different frequencies of toxoplasmic risk. It seems mandatory to forget all dogmatism and not to stick to a strictly statistical approach for a disease with not only medical but also social and human consequences."

The investigation protocol included sepsis screen, blood culture and 1 mL of venous blood for molecular analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bacterial DNA component encoding 16 s RNA in all cases. 100 newborns with probable sepsis were studied to evaluate the molecular diagnosis of sepsis using PCR amplification of 16 S RNA in newborns with risk factors for sepsis or those who have clinical evidence of sepsis. We compared the results of PCR with blood culture and other markers of sepsis screen (total leucocyte count (TLC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), immature/total neutrophil count ratio (I/T ratio), peripheral blood smear, micro ESR and C reactive protein (CRP). Controls consisted of 30 normal healthy newborns with no overt evidence of sepsis. Sepsis screen was positive in 24 (24%) of cases in study group with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 83.5% respectively. Blood culture was positive in 09(9%t) with sensitivity of 69.2% and specificity of 100%.

Six hundred sixty-nine children under the age of 5, representative of the open population, were enrolled by cluster sampling. High sensitive techniques for detection of multi-serotype carriage, i.e. broth enrichment and real-time PCR and sequential PCRs for detection and typing, respectively, were used. Of the 669 enrolled children, 97.8% were compliant with the recommended PCV7 vaccination schedule. Post-stratification adjustment for age was applied considering the Ligurian population as standard population. Age-weighted carriage rate was 50.1% and 78% of carriers were colonized by more than one serotype. The prevalence of carriage increased with age from 22% in the first year of life, to 48.6% in the second year of life and to 60% in the 25-59 month age group. Age-weighted prevalence of any of the PCV7, PCV10 or PCV13 serotypes was 10.3%, 20.3% and 27.5%, respectively. PCV7 serotypes were mainly represented by serotype 4 that was carried since the 3rd year of life and was responsible for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-IPD in adults, but not in children confirming the high vaccine effectiveness. Among the serotypes included in recently available vaccines, serotypes 5 and 19A showed a higher prevalence, being carried by 15.2% and 8.8% of the population, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that age, the presence of child siblings at home and day care attendance covariates were strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage. In conclusion, over 7 years of vaccination with PCV7 and very high coverage in the last 4 years has led to low carriage prevalence in the first year of life rapidly increasing in the following years and high prevalence of non-PCV7 serotypes carriage."

The eleven infants studied had a gestational age between 34 and 41 weeks and a birth weight between 1000 and 2780 grams. All but 2 of the infants presented with microcephaly and jaundice at birth. The diagnosis was confirmed postnatally in all infants by isolation of the virus or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the urine. Cranial US was performed in all, MRI in 6 during the neonatal period and later in infancy in 2. Auditory brainstem evoked responses (ABR) were performed in all survivors. US showed periventricular calcifications and/or lenticulostriate vasculopathy associated with mild to moderate ventricular dilatation in 10 of the 11 children. Periventricular (pseudo) cysts were seen in 6 children, being occipital in 4, temporal in 3 and fronto-parietal in 1. The cerebellum appeared to be small in 4 children. MRI provided additional information in 6 of the 8 children. Polymicrogyria in the perisylvian region was seen in 4 children, hippocampal dysplasia in 3 and cerebellar hypoplasia in 4 children.

CD011926,0,8667407,0,Comparison of culture with the polymerase chain reaction for detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum in endotracheal aspirates of preterm infants.,Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the urease genes of Ureaplasma urealyticum was compared with culture for detection of the organism in 100 endotracheal aspirates from 54 ventilated preterm infants. Ninety specimens gave negative results by both culture and PCR and three specimens gave positive results by both culture and PCR. Six specimens were negative by culture but positive by PCR. The one specimen positive by culture and negative by PCR was interpreted as a false-positive culture result. Overall agreement between results obtained by culture and PCR was 93%. PCR is a sensitive and reliable method for the detection of U. urealyticum in neonatal endotracheal secretions. Detection by PCR (1-2 days) is more rapid than culture (2-5 days) and this will be important if early therapeutic intervention is shown to be effective.

We investigated this association. Twenty-five pairs of gastric and tracheal tissue specimens obtained from autopsies of 25 children with previous diagnoses of SIDS were available for this study. The presence of H. pylori organisms was evaluated by three different methods: histology (hematoxylin-eosin or Giemsa staining), immunohistochemistry, and nested polymerase chain reaction technique. We were unable to confirm the presence of H. pylori organisms by the first two methods. H. pylori DNA was identified by nested polymerase chain reaction in six different tissue specimens (stomach, 4; trachea, 2). In no case was H. pylori DNA detected in both tissues. We concluded that H. pylori infection is most likely not associated with SIDS."

In a prospective case-control study we examined the incidence of these viruses in intrauterine fetal death and their association with fetal and placenta pathological findings. Molecular assays were performed on placenta tissue extracts of 62 fetal deaths and 35 controls for the detection of CMV, PB19 and HSV-1/2 genomes. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver, spleen and placenta tissues of fetal death cases were evaluated histologically. Thirty-four percent of placental specimens taken from intrauterine fetal deaths were positive for any of the three viruses (16%, 13%, and 5% positive for CMV, PB19, and HSV-1/2, respectively), whereas only 6% of those taken from full term newborns were positive (P = 0.0017). No dual infection was observed. This difference was also observed when fetal deaths with a gestational age <20 weeks or a gestational age >20 weeks were compared with the controls (P = 0.025 and P = 0.0012, respectively). Intrauterine death and the control groups differed in the detection rate of CMV DNA (16% and 3%, respectively; P = 0.047), which was more pronounced in a gestational age >20 weeks (P = 0.03). Examination of the pathological findings among the PCR-positive and PCR-negative fetal deaths revealed that hydrops fetalis and chronic villitis were more common among the former group (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0005, respectively). In conclusion, an association was detected between viral infection and fetal death, which was more pronounced in the advanced gestational age. Fetal hydrops and chronic villitis were evidently associated with viral DNA detection in cases of intrauterine death."

CD011926,0,22782828,0,Guidelines for the use of molecular biological methods to detect sexually transmitted pathogens in cases of suspected sexual abuse in children.,"Testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in children presents a number of problems for the practitioner that are not usually faced when testing adults for the same infections. The identification of an STI in a child, in addition to medical implications, can have serious legal implications. The presence of an STI is often used to support the presence or allegations of sexual abuse and conversely, the identification of an STI in a child will prompt an investigation of possible abuse. The significance of the identification of a sexually transmitted agent in such children as evidence of possible child sexual abuse varies by pathogen.While culture has historically been used for the detection of STIs in cases of suspected abuse in children, the increasing use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in adults and the increasing proliferation of second-generation tests with better sensitivity and specificity has made inroads into the use of such tests in children, especially for diagnostic and treatment purposes. Acceptance by the medicolegal system for sexual abuse cases is still controversial and more test cases will be necessary before definitive use becomes standard practice. In addition, if these assays ever become legally admissible in court, there will be recommendations that more than one NAAT assay be used in order to assure confirmation of the diagnostic result."

A cohort of 1,687 fecal samples was obtained from patients with gastroenteritis; 324 were rotavirus-positive. Of the remainder 1,363 rotavirus-negative samples, 1,087 samples were tested for NoV RNA in this study. The study enrolled 267 outpatients from Municipal Public Health Centers and 820 inpatients, whose samples were obtained by active surveillance in Public Hospitals. Fecal samples were tested by reverse transcription (RT) followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the MON 431-434 set of degenerate primers for NoV GI and GII detection, and there were 35.1% (381/1,087) positive samples for NoV, consisting of 30.2% (248/820) and 49.8% (133/267) from inpatient and outpatient, respectively. Children infected by NoV had significantly more frequent mucus in feces, vomiting and fever. No seasonal pattern in NoV infections was observed in patients admitted to hospital; however, two peaks of NoV infections were observed from ambulatory cases, suggesting that there was an occurrence of outbreaks in those time periods. Molecular characterization revealed GII to be the most prevalent genogroup, totaling 96.3% (104/108) of all sequences analyzed, and GII.4 was the genotype detected most frequently (80.7%), followed by GII.6, 3, 14, 7, and 8.

It is responsible for severe to life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised patients and in foetuses and newborns of infected mothers. For monitoring CMV load, classical techniques based on rapid culture or pp65 antigenemia are progressively replaced by quantitative nuclear acid tests (QNAT), easier to implement and standardize. A large variety of QNAT are available from laboratory-developed assays to fully-automated commercial tests. The indications of CMV quantification include CMV infection during pregnancy and in newborns, and viral surveillance of grafted and non-grafted immunocompromised patients, patients with bowel inflammatory diseases and those hospitalised in intensive care unit.

The analytical performance studies were performed for detection limit, reproducibility, cross-reactivity, and interference. For comparison, 92 norovirus-positive stool samples and 126 norovirus-negative samples for which the results were confirmed by 2 different real-time PCR kits were used. The rapid immunochromatography test detected the equivalent of 4.48×10(6) copies/mL of the norovirus genome in stool samples. On performing the repeatability/reproducibility test, samples above this concentration all provided positive results (100%) and 97.8% of the samples slightly below this concentration (2.45×10(6) copies/mL) provided negative results. No cross-reactivity or interference was detected. Positive percent agreement (sensitivity), negative percent agreement (specificity), and overall percent agreement of the rapid immunochromatography test compared with testing by real-time PCR were 90.2%, 100%, and 95.9%, respectively. In addition, the rapid immunochromatography test was completed within 20 min. The SD Bioline Norovirus test was, therefore, easier and more rapid to perform and showed excellent reproducibility, no cross-reactivity, no interference, and high agreement compared with real-time PCR. Thus, this test is useful for rapid screening to identity norovirus infection."

MSSA isolates with resistance to clindamycin and/or tobramycin were collected from the three county councils in southeast Sweden and investigated with spa typing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the SCCmec right extremity junction (MREJ) and DNA microarray technology. The 98 isolates were divided into 40 spa types, and by microarray clustered in 17 multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) clonal complexes (MLST-CCs). All isolates with combined resistance to clindamycin and tobramycin (n = 12) from Östergötland County and two additional isolates (clindamycin-R) were designated as spa type t002, MREJ type ii and were clustered in CC5, together with a representative isolate of the ECT-R clone, indicating the clone's persistence. These isolates also carried several genes encoding exotoxins, Q9XB68-dcs and qacC. Of the isolates in CC15, 83% (25/30) were tobramycin-resistant and were designated spa type t084. Of these, 68% (17/25) were isolated from new-borns in all three counties. The persistence of the ECT-R clone in Östergötland County, although not found in any other county in the region, carrying certain virulence factors that possibly enhance its survival in the hospital environment, highlights the fact that basic hygiene guidelines must be maintained even when MRSA prevalence is low."

We evaluated an approach by using the self-sustained sequence replication reaction (3SR) to amplify HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA directly. The amplified RNA product was then detected by bead-based sandwich oligonucleotide capture hybridization and rare earth metal chelate time-resolved fluorescence. The sensitivity of this technology was determined to be less than 12 HIV-1 RNA copies with an amplification level of 10(10)-fold with purified HIV-1 RNA. Plasma samples from 19 high-risk pediatric patients younger than 5 years of age were examined, and results were compared with viral culture of patient plasma. Results from plasma culture and 3SR amplification agreed for 14 of these patients and disagreed for 5. Of the five samples which did not agree, four were positive by 3SR and negative by culture and one was positive by culture and negative by 3SR but became positive by 3SR at a subsequent testing. We conclude that 3SR amplification coupled with time-resolved fluorescence is a promising technology for investigating the relationship between the presence of HIV-1 RNA in plasma and progression of disease in HIV-infected pediatric patients. This technology should be important in the assessment of HIV-1 infection, in evaluating drug therapies, and in understanding the pathogenesis and transmission of the virus."

Interestingly, this mild infection induces a strong activation of mucus secretion-related genes in young immunocompetent rodents that has not been explored in infants. Excess mucus is induced by multiple airway offenders through nonspecific pathways and would explain a cofactor role of Pneumocystis in respiratory disease. We undertook characterization of the prevalence of Pneumocystis and associated mucus in infant lungs."
CD011926,0,24767682,0,Evaluation of the RIDAGENE real-time PCR assay for the detection of GI and GII norovirus.,"The current study examined the efficacy of the RIDAGENE norovirus (NoV) real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany) for use in a routine diagnostic laboratory. The RIDAGENE assay had an overall sensitivity of 98% but was more sensitive for GII than GI NoV. The assay had a specificity of 98%. The RIDAGENE assay could detect a variety of GI and GII open reading frame 2 genotypes including GI.1, GI.3, GI.8, GI.13, GII.2, GII.3, GII.4 (including the following variants: 2006b, 2009, 2012, and 3 others that have not been assigned), GII.6, GII.12, and GII.13. The assay did not cross react with a number of gastroenteritis viruses including adenovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, and sapovirus. The assay was straightforward to perform, and for a run of 50 specimens, a result was obtainable in roughly 4 hours. The RIDAGENE assay can be recommended as a valuable detection method for NoV."

CD011926,0,9637577,0,Maternal cell-free viremia in the natural history of perinatal HIV-1 transmission: a meta-analysis.,"We performed a meta-analysis of the predictive value of maternal cell-free viral load in vertical HIV-1 transmission, including 9 cohorts with 1115 mother-infant pairs (696 untreated and 419 treated women). The pooled rate of transmission in untreated women was 21.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.3%-24.5%). The rates of transmission for untreated women in the <1000 copies/ml, 1000 to 9999 copies/ml, and > or = 10,000 copies/ml categories were 5% (95% CI, 2%-11%), 15% (95% CI, 11%-20%) and 37% (95% CI, 29%-46% by random effects), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in individual studies ranged from 0.67 to 1.00. The predictive performance of RNA differed between cohorts in which different percentages of transmitters had RNA values >10,000 copies/ml. When 95% of transmitters have RNA values >1000 copies/ml, 77% of nontransmitters would also have values above this cutoff. Transmission rates for treated women in the 1000 to 9999 copies/ml category (7%; 95% CI, 4%-11%,) and > or = 10,000 copies/ml category (18%; 95% CI, 12%-27%) were probably lower than those for untreated women, whereas the transmission rate for treated women with <1000 copies/ml was 5% (95% CI, 2%-11 %). Thus, the risk gradient between RNA categories seems attenuated in treated women. Several aspects of the design, analysis, and reporting of research in this area may be improved in the future with attention to selection and observer biases, multivariate adjustment, and technical consistency. Maternal HIV-1 RNA is a modest predictor of transmission for individual mothers, but a strong predictor of the average risk in groups of untreated mothers. Its discriminatory power is better in untreated than in treated populations and is better in cohorts with a high prevalence of elevated viral load values than in cohorts with generally low levels of viremia."
CD011926,0,15157047,0,Immunohistochemical and in situ detection of cytomegalovirus in lung autopsies of children immunocompromised by secondary interstitial pneumonia.,"Secondary interstitial pneumonia (SIP), a disease affecting patients immunocompromised by primary underlying diseases during their treatment in hospital, is frequently associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, a potentially treatable condition. However, in many cases, no infectious agent can be determined, and this clinical disease rapidly progresses to death. Theoretically, SIP could be caused by CMV, which may be present in such small amounts or such configuration that routine histopathological analysis or viral culture techniques cannot detect the virus. To test the hypothesis that immunohistochemistry (IH) and in situ detection by hybridization (ISH) provides more accurate results than the mere histological demonstration of CMV inclusions, these methods were applied to 37 autopsied lung sections obtained from children immunocompromised by primary underlying diseases and who died of SIP. As a result, the cases were subdivided into three groups: (1) children with SIP CMV inclusions (Diffuse alveolar damage-DAD-related) (n = 7); (2) children with SIP without classical viral inclusions (CMV-DAD-related) (n = 3); (3) children with SIP exhibiting nuclear cytopathic effect (not CMV-NSIP-related) (n = 27). In the first group, all three techniques yielded clearly positive results, whereas IH and ISH indicated that three of the children of the second group had CMV-related DAD without histological demonstration of CMV inclusions. In the third group, there were no positive CMV signals. These data indicate that DAD-related CMV infection is an important cause of SIP and of death in children immunosuppressed by primary underlying diseases, and that IH and in situ detection were more sensitive than the histological demonstration of CMV inclusions. A direct involvement of CMV in SIP exhibiting DAD is likely, but not in the non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. We conclude that all children with primary underlying diseases should be investigated for CMV SIP using sensitive IH and in situ tests in conjunction with histological routine procedures."
CD011926,0,17634409,0,Decreased expression of tumor necrosis factor family receptors involved in humoral immune responses in preterm neonates.,"Neonates have an increased rate of infection with encapsulated bacteria compared with older children and adults because of diminished antibody responses to T-independent (TI) antigens such as bacterial polysaccharides. Because the interactions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family ligands BAFF and APRIL with the TNF family receptors (TNFRs) TACI, BCMA, and BAFF-R are crucial to TI antibody responses, we measured the expression of these receptors on adult and cord blood-derived term and preterm neonatal B cells. Preterm neonatal B cells expressed less TACI, BCMA, and BAFF-R compared with adult B cells and had significantly less proliferation compared with adult B cells after stimulation with human recombinant BAFF and anti-IgM in an assay in which TACI-Fc fusion protein inhibits B-cell proliferation. In addition, neonatal dendritic cells had diminished expression of B7-1, B7-2, and CD40 compared with adult cells. Finally, neonatal B cells, particularly preterm B cells, exhibited markedly decreased production of IgG and IgA in response to CD40L and IL-10. Overall, this study shows that maturational delay in TNFR expression particularly by preterm neonatal B cells may interfere with effective antibody responses to TI antigens, cognate T- and B-cell interactions and normal isotype switching."

The overall genotype identification rate from CSF-positive material was 43%. The four most common genotypes identified were Echovirus 6 (24%), Echovirus 30 (17%), Echovirus 25 (10%), and Coxsackievirus A9 (10%), together comprising 61% of all EVs typed. The seasonal distribution of all EVs identified followed the recognized pattern of mainly summer epidemics. Three of the four predominant genotypes were present in each of the 6 years in which the study was conducted, with 20 other EV genotypes also detected, often in only a single year. Genotyping of EVs directly in CSF is faster, simpler and more sensitive than traditional virus neutralization assays performed on EV positive samples."
CD011926,0,12719664,0,[Childhood Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis].,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in areas bordering the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Morocco, Tunisia) where it is caused by Leishmania infantum and it is transmitted by the bite of hematophagous sandfly belonging to Phlebotomus spp.; dog constitutes the main reservoir of the infection. In comparison with the past, when VL was typically observed more frequently in children, the current ratio of childhood to adult cases is approximately 1:1. The onset of the disease is characterized by a non-specific initial symptomatology; fever, pallor and splenomegaly are always present. Pancytopenia is present very often; the laboratory diagnosis is established by serological tests (indirect fluorescent-antibody assay, immunoassay test, indirect hemagglutination assay) and by demonstration of Leishmania parasites by microscopy, culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the bone marrow aspirates. The use of PCR performed on peripheral blood has been reported to be highly sensitive for the diagnosis and the follow up of children with VL. Pentavalent antimonial drugs have been used for many decades as standard treatment for VL; in Italy liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) is nowadays considered the first-line treatment for VL."
CD011926,0,23443029,0,Recurrent subacute post-viral onset of ataxia associated with a PRF1 mutation.,"Inflammation is an important contributor to pediatric and adult neurodegeneration. Understanding the genetic determinants of neuroinflammation provides valuable insight into disease mechanism. We characterize a disorder of recurrent immune-mediated neurodegeneration. We report two sisters who presented with neurodegeneration triggered by infections. The proband, a previously healthy girl, presented at 22.5 months with ataxia and dysarthria following mild gastroenteritis. MRI at onset showed a symmetric signal abnormality of the cerebellar and peritrigonal white matter. Following a progressive course of partial remissions and relapses, she died at 5 years of age. Her older sister had a similar course following varicella infection, she died within 13 months. Both sisters had unremarkable routine laboratory testing, with exception of a transient mild cytopenia in the proband 19 months after presentation. Exome sequencing identified a biallelic perforin1 mutation (PRF1; p.R225W) previously associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). In contrast to FHL, these girls did not have hematopathology or cytokine overproduction. However, 3 years after disease onset, the proband had markedly deficient interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) production. These observations extend the spectrum of disease associated with perforin mutations to immune-mediated neurodegeneration triggered by infection and possibly due to primary immunodeficiency."

CD011926,0,26482269,0,Interference between respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus in respiratory tract infections in children.,"An acute viral respiratory tract infection might prevent infections by other viruses because of the antiviral innate immune response. However, with the use of PCR methods, simultaneous detection of two or more respiratory viruses is frequent. We analysed the effect of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection on the occurrence of simultaneous rhinovirus (RV) infection in children within a birth cohort study setting. We used PCR for virus detection in nasal swabs collected from children with an acute respiratory tract infection at the age of 0-24 months and from healthy control children, who were matched for age and date of sample collection. Of 226 children with RSV infections, 18 (8.0%) had co-infections with RV, whereas RV was detected in 31 (14%) of 226 control children (p 0.049 by chi-square test). Adjustment for sex, number of siblings and socio-economic status strengthened the negative association between RSV and RV (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24-0.90; p 0.02). The median durations of symptoms (cough, rhinorrhoea, or fever) were 11 days in children with single RSV infections and 14 days in children with RSV-RV co-infections (p 0.02). Our results suggest that the presence of RSV reduces the probability of RV infection, but that, if a co-infection occurs, both viruses cause clinical symptoms."

CD011926,0,20827766,0,Molecular detection of adeno-associated virus in cases of spontaneous and intentional human abortion.,"Pregnancy failure is a common event and often of unknown cause. Some viruses are thought to cause abortions including the adeno-associated viruses (AAV), viruses which are regarded as being without any definitive association to any human disease. This study investigated AAV infection in 81 human abortions, both spontaneous and intentional that occurred up to the 23rd week of gestation. Nucleic acid of AAV-2, 3, and 5 types from 118 decidual and chorionic tissues, collected from the patients in this study, was amplified by nested-PCR. In situ hybridization (ISH) was developed with a digoxigenin-labeled AAV probe in paraffin embedded tissues from the AAV positive cases. AAV was observed in 28.4% (23/81) of the cases, of which, 78.3% (18/23) were in the decidua and 21.7% (5/23) in the extravillous trophoblast, the chorionic plate, or chorionic villi fragments. AAV-2, the only type detected, occurred in 32.3% (22/68) and in 7.7% (1/13) of the spontaneous and intentional abortions, respectively. ISH revealed AAV in the decidua, chorionic tissue or chorionic plate and extravillous trophoblast. The detection of only AAV-2 type indicates that it is the most frequent in the population studied and/or shows tissue tropism. The presence of AAV in decidual or trophoblastic cells in cases of abortion, as observed by ISH, implies that the virus could jeopardize the pregnancy. The significant predominance in spontaneous cases suggests possibly a causal association between AAV and abortion."

Mixed infections were identified in four cases, two with influenza A H1, one with H3 and one with influenza B. Children aged 5-14 years were more likely to have detectable M. pneumoniae in samples than all other age groups (Fishers p = 0.03), attributed to the 2005-2006 season in which 6.0% (12/200, 95%CI 3.4-10.3) of 5-14 year olds had detectable M. pneumoniae in comparison to 2.2% in 2006-2007 (3/141 95%CI 0.5-6.4), 2.2% in 2007-2008 (2/89 95%CI 0.1-8.3) and 0% in 2008-2009 (0/151 95%CI 0-2.9)."
CD011926,0,22816235,0,The role of IgG avidity in diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection in newborns and infants.,"To evaluate the value of IgG avidity in diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in newborns and infants we collected serum samples from 40 infants under 12 months of age with suspected congenital CMV infection. Sera were tested for IgM, IgG and IgG avidity. For 25 of them, virus isolation and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on urine specimens were performed. Thirteen (32.5%) patients showed the presence of CMV IgM antibodies, 3 (7.5%) had equivocal IgM result, and 24 (60.0%) patients had IgG antibodies only. Using IgG avidity, CMV infection (low avidity index-AI) was documented in 61.5% IgM positive and 54.2% IgM negative patients. Eight of nine (88.8%) IgM positive patients were positive either on virus isolation or PCR. In IgM negative patients, 46.6% urine cultures were positive for CMV and 66.6% were PCR positive. According to age, IgG avidity demonstrated acute/recent primary CMV infection in 58.8% patients younger than three months compared with 91.7% and 81.8% in 3-6 and 6-12 months old babies, respectively. In conclusion, IgG avidity is useful in diagnosis of CMV infection either in IgM positive or IgM negative children older than 3 months of age. In infants less than 3 months, transplacentally derived maternal IgG antibodies of high avidity influence on the IgG avidity result. In these children, CMV infection should be confirmed by direct virologic methods such as virus isolation or PCR."

Additional fluorescence in situ hybridization studies with locus-specific BAC probes and analyses with microsatellite markers revealed that this translocation resulted in a paternal chromosome 11q terminal deletion of approximately 8.9 Mb and a subtelomeric 20q duplication of approximately 3.7 Mb. A subtelomeric 20q trisomy has only been reported in four cases so far. A subtelomeric 11q deletion has been clinically reported in 18 patients. We review the clinical phenotype of these patients.

Infants had a nasopharyngeal aspiration tested by PCR, and acute and convalescent sera were collected during their disease. Mothers had a first acute serum collected concomitantly with the infant's acute serum, and both acute sera were compared to a prepartum serum. Sera were analyzed by immunoblotting for the detection of anti-pertussis toxin (PT) antibodies. Serological evidence of pertussis in infants was assessed as either an increase in anti-PT antibody levels between the mother's prepartum and acute sera or the presence of antibodies in the infant's acute serum and their absence in both the mother's acute and prepartum sera. Culture and PCR sensitivity were 43 and 89%, respectively. Most infants (18 of 24) had no pertussis antibody detectable in their acute sera, confirming a delayed immune response at this age. A comparison of infant's and mother's serology, using prepartum serum, rapidly confirmed the diagnosis in 57% of the cases. Although less sensitive than PCR, this serological method should be used for a rapid diagnosis of pertussis in young infants when culture and PCR are either not available or negative."

In some reports, up to 29% of the patients diagnosed with pertussis have in fact B. holmesii infection and invasive, non-respiratory B. holmesii infections have been reported worldwide. This misdiagnosis undermines the knowledge of pertussis' epidemiology, and may lead to misconceptions on pertussis vaccine's efficacy. Recently, the number of whooping cough cases has increased significantly in several countries. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether B. holmesii was contributing to the increase in laboratory-confirmed cases of B. pertussis in Switzerland. A multiplex species-specific quantitative PCR assay was performed on 196 nasopharyngeal samples from Swiss patients with PCR-confirmed Bordetella infection (median age: 6 years-old, minimum 21 days-old, maximum 86 years-old), formerly diagnosed as Bordetella pertussis (IS481+). No B. holmesii (IS481+, IS1001-, hIS1001+) was identified. We discuss whether laboratories should implement specific PCR to recognize different Bordetella species. We conclude that in Switzerland B. holmesii seems to be circulating less than in neighboring countries and that specific diagnostic procedures are not necessary routinely. However, as the epidemiological situation may change rapidly, periodic reevaluation is suggested."

Few are solely due to severe hypoxia or ischemia at birth. This common myth has held back research in causation. The cost of litigation has devastating effects on maternity services with unnecessarily high cesarean delivery rates and subsequent maternal morbidity and mortality. CP rates have remained the same for 50 years despite a 6-fold increase in cesarean birth. Epidemiological studies have shown that the origins of most CP are prior to labor. Increased risk is associated with preterm delivery, congenital malformations, intrauterine infection, fetal growth restriction, multiple pregnancy, and placental abnormalities. Hypoxia at birth may be primary or secondary to preexisting pathology and international criteria help to separate the few cases of CP due to acute intrapartum hypoxia. Until recently, 1-2% of CP (mostly familial) had been linked to causative mutations. Recent genetic studies of sporadic CP cases using new-generation exome sequencing show that 14% of cases have likely causative single-gene mutations and up to 31% have clinically relevant copy number variations. The genetic variants are heterogeneous and require function investigations to prove causation. Whole genome sequencing, fine scale copy number variant investigations, and gene expression studies may extend the percentage of cases with a genetic pathway. Clinical risk factors could act as triggers for CP where there is genetic susceptibility.

The prenatal examination (serologic investigation for Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and syphilis (TORCHES)) was negative. In both cases prenatal ultrasonography was abnormal and suggested intrauterine infection. The infants were born with typical symptoms of multisystem disease, known as symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection (jaundice, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly and cerebral calcifications) and congenital rubella syndrome (intrauterine growth retardation, congenital heart disease, cataract, hepatosplenomegaly and cerebral calcifications), respectively. Both had severe cerebral damage. To diagnose severe congenital infection in the first trimester of pregnancy in presence of congenital anomalies in utero there are other possible methods than TORCHES investigation, such as polymerase chain reaction and virus culture in amniotic fluid or in foetal blood obtained by cord puncture."

Total DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 134 children with EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis (EBV-IM) and 32 children with EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) who were admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital from 2006 to 2011. The EBNA3C, BZLF1, and Zp genes were amplified by PCR assay. Typing of EBV was performed according to the size of the amplification product of EBNA3C gene; the amplification products of BZLF1 and Zp genes were subjected to direct sequencing, and sequence analysis was performed using BioEdit 7. 0. 9. The results were as follows: (1) EBV-1 was present in 140 samples (97.2%, 140/144) and EBV-II in 4 samples (2.8%, 4/144). (2) Three BZLF1 genotypes and their 12 subtypes (including 6 newly found subtypes) were detected in this study; there were no significant differences in the frequencies of BZLF1-A and BZLF1-B between the children with EBV-IM and EBV-HLH (P = 0.083); BZLF1-A1 was the dominant genotype in children with EBV-associated diseases; t BZLF1-A mostly had three 29-bp repeats in the first intron of BZLF1 gene, and BZLF1-B mostly had 30-bp repeats (P = 0.000), with the number of repeats varying from 1 to 13. (3) Four Zp genotypes were detected in this study, including Zp-P, Zp-V3, Zp-V4, and Zp-V1; there were no significant differences in the frequencies of these Zp genotypes between children with EBV-IM and EBV-HLH (P = 0.272, 0.252, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively). (4) The linkage analysis of BZLF1 gene and its promoter Zp showed that BZLF1-A1 was highly associated with Zp-V3 (P = 0.000), while BZLF1-B4 with Zp-P (P = 0.000); EBV-I + BZLF1 A1 was highly associated with Zp-V3 (P = 0.000), while EBV-I+BZLF1-B4 with Zp-P (P = 0.000). The conclusions are as follows: (1) BZLF1-A1 is the dominant genotype in children with EBV-associated diseases; there are mostly 29-bp repeats in the first intron of BZLF1 gene for BZLF1-A genotype and 30-bp repeats for BZLF1-B genotype. (2) Zp-P and Zp-V3 are dominant Zp genotypes of EBV in children, which shared similar detection rates. (3) BZLF1-A1 is highly associated with Zp-V3, while BZLF1-B4 with Zp-P; EBV-I+BZLF1-A1 is highly associated with Zp-V3, while EBV-I+BZLF1-B4 with Zp-P."
CD011926,0,15188708,0,Amino-acid change on the antigenic region B1 of H3 haemagglutinin may be a trigger for the emergence of drift strain of influenza A virus.,"Sera from 27 children and eight older persons, which had been collected in 1998 and 1999 and showed haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) activity against influenza A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) strain, were characterized with a binding assay using chimeric haemagglutinin (HA) proteins between A/Aichi/2/68 (A/AI/68) and A/Sydney/5/97 (A/SD/97) strains. Sera from the young children had a tendency to recognize only the antigenic site B1 of the HA1 region. On the other hand, sera of the older individuals were fully reactive to all antigenic sites of HA1 except antigenic site D. Recent epidemic strains, A/Panama/2007/99 (A/PM/99)-like viruses have differences in amino acids in antigenic sites A, C, and B2 but not B1. However, human antisera obtained even from young children had HI activity to Panama-like viruses. The limited epidemic of A/PM/99-like viruses may have been due to the existence of antibody against B1, which had been produced in response to infection by the A/SD/97-like viruses."
CD011926,0,11773110,0,Evaluation of the OptiMAL rapid antigen test and species-specific PCR to detect placental Plasmodium falciparum infection at delivery.,"During pregnancy, Plasmodium falciparum infection of the placenta frequently occurs in the absence of parasites in peripheral blood. We investigated the abilities of the OptiMAL rapid immunochromatographic strip test for P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase and species-specific PCR performed on peripheral blood to detect placental infection or malaria-associated low birth weight. Of 509 Malawian women screened by microscopy, 76 had malaria infection. Among these 509 women, the frequency of peripheral blood parasitemia was low. The OptiMAL test gave positive results in 37 of 171 women tested (one of whom had placental but not peripheral blood parasitemia) and had sensitivities of 71% for peripheral parasitemia and 38% for placental parasitemia compared to the microscopy values. The specificity for peripheral parasitemia was 94%. In 135 women, PCR had sensitivities of 94% for peripheral blood malaria detected by microscopy and 72% for placental infection. In samples examined by PCR, the prevalence of malaria in peripheral blood increased from 26.7% by microscopy to 51.9%. Women with placental malaria and women with malaria in peripheral blood samples by microscopy or OptiMAL testing, but not women with malaria detected only by PCR, had lower-birth-weight babies than did women without malaria by these criteria. Positive results by PCR in the absence of microscopic parasitemia were not associated with low birth weight. Neither OptiMAL nor PCR testing of peripheral blood is adequately sensitive to detect all placental malaria infection, but a positive result by OptiMAL testing identifies women with a high proportion of low-birth-weight babies."

CD011926,0,17493958,0,Neonatal human autologous dendritic cells pulsed with recombinant protein antigen prime the generation of non-polarized CD4 T-cell effectors.,"The functional capability of human neonatal CD4 T cells to respond to vaccine antigens is frequently described as Th2 biased, but whether this is due to defective T-cell or antigen-presenting cell (APC) function is unclear. In this study, we used purified T cells and autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) as APCs to model primary and secondary neonatal CD4 T-cell responses in vitro to BBG2Na, a recombinant protein subunit vaccine candidate against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Neonatal MDDCs were phenotypically and functionally comparable to adult-derived MDDCs in terms of stimulatory capacity, longevity and ability to direct Th1 differentiation. When pulsed with BBG2Na, they induced antigen-specific neonatal CD4 T-cell proliferation. Analysis of cytokine production by quantitative real-time PCR showed significant production of IFN-gamma and IL-13 mRNA, analogous to the non-polarized primary cytokine mRNA response exhibited by both neonatal and adult naive CD4 T cells when primed by keyhole limpet haemocyanin. This contrasts with BBG2Na-activated adult CD45R0+ve memory CD4 T-cell responses, originally primed by natural RSV infection, which demonstrated a polarized Th1 cytokine profile. Importantly, on secondary stimulation, BBG2Na-primed neonatal CD4 T cells exhibited a 4-fold increase in antigen-specific proliferation and a 5-fold increase in IFN-gamma production. These data suggest that early life human CD4 T cells in vitro are intrinsically functionally capable of being primed by subunit vaccine candidate antigens such as BBG2Na, and differentiate into non-polarized rather than Th2 effectors."

Serum samples from 114 HBV-infected women were analyzed. Viral loads correlated with HBeAg/anti-HBe status and viral genotypes. Among 95 mothers whose serum contained anti-HBe, viral loads ranged between undetectable and 8.6 x 10(6) IU/mL (median 228 IU/mL). Ten (10.5%) of these mothers had plasma viral loads >10(4) IU/mL; 6 were infected with genotype E and one each with genotypes A, B, C, and D. All viruses had precore stop codon or basal core promoter mutations. Preponderance of genotypes other than A among antenatal mothers in the United Kingdom reflects increasing globalization and trends in immigration. HBeAg serostatus is no longer sufficiently accurate for inferring potential infectivity of pregnant HBV carriers."

To better characterize the immune response to these parasites, we monitored immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels in a cohort of children from Lima, Peru. Two new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays based on the C. parvum (bovine, subtype IIa) Iowa strain 17-kDa and 27-kDa antigens were used to measure IgG antibody levels in longitudinal serum samples. Antibody responses were detected during infections with C. parvum, C. felis, and C. meleagridis and with four different subtypes of C. hominis. We also noted that the magnitude of the antibody response was related to the number of previous infections and that older children generally had higher levels of antibodies to the two C. parvum antigens. Antibody responses were not associated with infections with either Cyclospora sp. or Giardia sp. We believe the antibody assays will be important tools for monitoring the success of future public health interventions."

Prenatal diagnosis and newborn screening help to reduce the societal burden as well as the morbidity due to IEM. IEM occur in India, and the need of the time is to have large diagnostic and screening programs to dilute the gene pool."
CD011926,0,21108353,0,Respiratory viruses in children admitted to hospital intensive care units: evaluating the CLART® Pneumovir DNA array.,"Viruses play a significant part in children's respiratory infections, sometimes leading to hospitalization in cases of severe respiratory distress. The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory infections in children treated in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Assays were performed using the CLART® Pneumovir DNA array assay (Genomica, Coslada, Madrid, Spain), which makes it possible to detect 11 genus of respiratory viruses simultaneously. During the winter of 2008-2009, 73 respiratory specimens collected from 53 children under 2 years of age and admitted to an ICU were tested. At least one virus was detected in 78% (57/73) of the samples. The virological diagnosis was based on single infections in 65% (37/57) and on multiple infections in 35% (20/57) of cases. The array assay revealed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 73.6% (42/57) of the samples and rhinovirus in 24.6% (14/57), either on their own or in co-infections. All viruses identified in single and multiple infections were tested, taking into account clinical features, risk factors, and severity criteria. Children with no risk factors presented more multiple infections, up to 42% of cases, than children with at least one risk factor. RSV seemed to induce severe symptoms by itself as no difference in intubation needs was observed when RSV was detected on its own or in co-infection. The CLART® Pneumovir DNA array was useful for examining severe viral respiratory infections, when other viruses than those detected by conventional methods could be involved, particularly in an ICU."
CD011926,0,12063438,0,"HPV and pregnancy: diagnostic methods, transmission and evolution.","Pregnancy may foster the development of infections, in particular HPV infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the entity of the relationship between HPV infection and pregnancy, with all the possible complications associated with this relationship. The pathology may be latent or manifest. Possible methods of diagnosis are clinical, namely gynecological examinations, PAP-tests, colposcopy or molecular, using viral DNA assay, Southern Blot, PCR, Hybrid Capture, etc. The prevalence of HPV infection in pregnancy varies between 5.4 and 68.8%. The population with the highest risk, also among pregnant women, are those under the age of 26. A number of different opinions emerge from the literature regarding the possibility of maternal-fetal virus transmission. None of the patients examined carried out treatment during pregnancy. The data reported in the literature on the relationship between HPV and pregnancy are highly discordant. This discrepancy depends on the diagnostic techniques used, the clinical history of the pregnant woman and the period of pregnancy when the sample is collected. Pregnancy enhances the development of the pathology which then often recedes in the postpartum. The possible maternal-fetal transmission of the virus is an important aspect: the letter is the main factor responsible for juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis. A number of Authors report an initial presence of HPV in newborns which often disappears within 6 months after birth."
CD011926,0,11361837,0,Vertical transmission of HIV in New York State: a basis for statewide testing of newborns.,"Infants (n = 313) of HIV-infected mothers were enrolled (mean age 1.9 weeks, range 0-8 weeks) in a 3-year prospective study of vertical transmission. Fifty-six infants (17.9%) had laboratory and clinical evidence of HIV infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provided early and reliable identification of infected infants. Thirty-one of the 56 infected infants had specimens submitted when the infants were 4 weeks of age or less and 30 (97%) tested PCR positive. This percentage increased to 100% by 8 weeks of age when 51 of the 56 infected infants had specimens tested for that time period. Immune complex dissociation (ICD) antigen testing was a sensitive method for diagnosis of infection but only in infants older than 1 month. p24 antigen testing, although free of false positives, is less sensitive than either of the other methods. Among surrogate markers of HIV infection, elevation of soluble CD8 levels precedes an increase in immunoglobulin levels or a decline in CD4 T lymphocytes. Vertical transmission is significantly lower in Central and Western New York State than other regions. Transmission is significantly higher in low birthweight babies and in infants whose mothers have CD4 counts < 500. This study provided the basis for establishing a Pediatric HIV PCR Testing Service for the early diagnosis of HIV infection in neonates."

HIV RNA was detected in 90% of maternal and in 38% of cord plasma at levels at least 25% of maternal plasma. Heteroduplex mobility assays and sequencing of virus envelope (C2-V5) demonstrated closely related, but unique, subtype C viruses in maternal and cord RNA, and a significantly greater frequency of cord viremia among women with homogenous, compared with heterogeneous viral envelope RNA. Quantification of RNA, measures of envelope viral diversity, and phylogenetic analysis of maternal and cord plasma RNA provide evidence for the frequent exposure and potential transmission of HIV from mother to infant before birth."
CD011926,0,25793402,0,Evidence of long-lived founder virus in mother-to-child HIV transmission.,"Exposure of the infant's gut to cell-associated and cell-free HIV-1 trafficking in breast milk (BM) remains a primary cause of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). The mammary gland represents a unique environment for HIV-1 replication and host-virus interplay. We aimed to explore the origin of the virus transmitted during breastfeeding, and the link with quasi-species found in acellular and cellular fractions of breast-milk (BM) and in maternal plasma. The C2-V5 region of the env gene was amplified, cloned and sequenced from the RNA and DNA of BM, the RNA from the mother's plasma (PLA) and the DNA from infant's dried blood spot (DBS) in 11 post-natal mother-infant pairs. Sequences were assembled in Geneious, aligned in ClustalX, manually edited in SeAL and phylogenetic reconstruction was undertaken in PhyML and MrBayes. We estimated the timing of transmission (ETT) and reconstructed the time for the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the infant in BEAST. Transmission of single quasi-species was observed in 9 of 11 cases. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated a BM transmission event by cell-free virus in 4 cases, and by cell-associated virus in 2 cases but could not be identified in the remaining 5 cases. Molecular clock estimates, of the infant ETT and TMRCA, corresponded well with the timing of transmission estimated by sequential infant DNA PCR in 10 of 11 children. The TMRCA of BM variants were estimated to emerge during gestation in 8 cases. We hypothesize that in the remaining cases, the breast was seeded with a long-lived lineage latently infecting resting T-cells. Our analysis illustrated the role of DNA and RNA virus in MTCT. We postulate that DNA archived viruses stem from latently infected quiescent T-cells within breast tissue and MTCT can be expected to continue, albeit at low levels, should interventions not effectively target these cells."

Mexico virus-like strains detected by primers NV36/51 were transiently prevalent in 1995/1996. Significantly more human caliciviruses were detected when primers were designed from contemporaneously circulating strains. Nucleotide sequences of a highly conserved region in the RNA polymerase gene of 10 selected human caliciviruses were determined. Eight strains were Norwalk-like viruses and two strains were Sapporo-like viruses. Seven of the eight Norwalk-like viruses also were positive by the recombinant Mexico virus antigen EIA. The seven Mexico virus EIA-positive strains revealed two patterns in the RNA polymerase sequences: two strains were closest to Mexico virus and the other five strains were closest to Lordsdale virus. One of the five ""Lordsdale"" viruses was found to be a naturally occurring recombinant between the Mexico virus and Lordsdale human calicivirus genetic clusters [Jiang et al., (1999b) Archives of Virology 144:2377-2387]. The Mexico virus EIA-negative strain had 73-77% nucleotide identity with the closest related Norwalk-like viruses, indicating it might belong to a new genetic cluster of the Norwalk-like virus genus. The two Sapporo-like viruses were distinct genetically; one belonged to the Houston/90 or Parkville cluster and the other to a new cluster. Some strains appeared to have short periods of prevalence and locally adapted primer pairs significantly increased detection rates. The finding of high diversity of circulating strains, including recombinant strains and strains with previously unrecognized genetic identities, highlights a need for studies of human caliciviruses in these children and other populations."

The primary endpoint was the outcome of the infant at 1 year of age. A prospective, consecutive study was performed in 49 infants born to mothers with primary Toxoplasma infection during pregnancy. PCR determinations of Toxoplasma gondii DNA in amniotic fluid were carried out as part of their prenatal management. Infants were examined at birth, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Nine of 11 infants from pregnancies with positive PCR results proved to be infected based on follow-up serological investigations conducted during the first year of life. Two fetal deaths occurred. All 38 infants with negative PCR results remained uninfected at 1 year of age, irrespective of whether their mothers had received treatment with sulfadiazine/pyrimethamine or spiramycin alone. Psychomotor development was normal in all infants. This follow-up study confirms that PCR performed on amniotic fluid is a useful method for identification or exclusion of fetal Toxoplasma infection. Treatment of infected pregnant women and - in the event of a positive PCR result subsequent treatment of their infants is associated with a favorable outcome."

CD011926,0,17229866,0,Human herpesvirus 6 DNA levels in cerebrospinal fluid due to primary infection differ from those due to chromosomal viral integration and have implications for diagnosis of encephalitis.,"The prevalence and concentration of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the immunocompetent in primary infection was compared with that in viral chromosomal integration. Samples from 510 individuals with suspected encephalitis, 200 young children and 310 older children and/or adults, and 12 other patients were tested. HHV-6 DNA concentration (log(10) copies/ml) was measured in CSF, serum, and whole blood using PCR. Serum HHV-6 immunoglobulin G antibody was measured by indirect immunofluorescence. Primary infection was defined by antibody seroconversion and/or a low concentration of HHV-6 DNA (<3.0 log(10) copies/ml) in a seronegative serum. Chromosomal integration was defined by a high concentration of viral DNA in serum (>/=3.5 log(10) copies/ml) or whole blood (>/=6.0 log(10) copies/ml). The prevalences of CSF HHV-6 DNA in primary infection and chromosomal integration were 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively, in the young children (<2 years) and 0% and 1.3%, respectively, in the older children and/or adults. The mean concentration of CSF HHV-6 DNA in 9 children with primary infection (2.4 log(10) copies/ml) was significantly lower than that of 21 patients with viral chromosomal integration (4.0 log(10) copies/ml). Only HHV-6B DNA was found in primary infection, whereas in viral integration, 4 patients had HHV-6A and 17 patients HHV-6B. Apart from primary infection, chromosomal integration is the most likely cause of HHV-6 DNA in the CSF of the immunocompetent. Our results show that any diagnosis of HHV-6 encephalitis or other type of active central nervous system infection should not be made without first excluding chromosomal HHV-6 integration by measuring DNA load in CSF, serum, and/or whole blood."

Importance of the Guthrie card].,"A girl aged 4 weeks had persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, haematological abnormalities and hepatosplenomegalia due to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection; thereafter she had a psychomotoric retardation. A girl aged 6 months had psychomotoric retardation and microcephaly due to a CMV infection, with epilepsy and perception deafness. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CMV-DNA in the blood on the Guthrie card demonstrated retrospectively in both cases that the infection was congenital. A 4-month-old boy had parents who had both experienced a CMV infection around the birth of the child. The child was infected with CMV but the absence of CMV-DNA in the blood on the Guthrie card revealed that the infection was not congenital. Only 10% of infants with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth; the prognosis is then poor. Up to 10-15% of the asymptomatic patients will develop neurological manifestations.

However, when CMV infection is not considered during this period it is later still possible to diagnose congenital CMV infection with a PCR for CMV-DNA in blood spots of Guthrie cards taken during the first week of life."
CD011926,0,25240872,0,"New patterns of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones, community-associated MRSA genotypes behave like healthcare-associated MRSA genotypes within hospitals, Argentina.","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) burden is increasing worldwide in hospitals [healthcare-associated (HA)-MRSA] and in communities [community-associated (CA)-MRSA]. However, the impact of CA-MRSA within hospitals remains limited, particularly in Latin America. A countrywide representative survey of S. aureus infections was performed in Argentina by analyzing 591 clinical isolates from 66 hospitals in a prospective cross-sectional, multicenter study (Nov-2009). This work involved healthcare-onset infections-(HAHO, >48 hospitalization hours) and community-onset (CO) infections [including both, infections (HACO) in patients with healthcare-associated risk-factors (HRFs) and infections (CACO) in those without HRFs]. MRSA strains were genetically typed as CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA genotypes (CA-MRSAG and HA-MRSAG) by SCCmec- and spa-typing, PFGE, MLST and virulence genes profile by PCR. Considering all isolates, 63% were from CO-infections and 55% were MRSA [39% CA-MRSAG and 16% HA-MRSAG]. A significantly higher MRSA proportion among CO- than HAHO-S. aureus infections was detected (58% vs 49%); mainly in children (62% vs 43%). The CA-MRSAG/HA-MRSAG have accounted for 16%/33% of HAHO-, 39%/13% of HACO- and 60.5%/0% of CACO-infections. Regarding the epidemiological associations identified in multivariate models for patients with healthcare-onset CA-MRSAG infections, CA-MRSAG behave like HA-MRSAG within hospitals but children were the highest risk group for healthcare-onset CA-MRSAG infections. Most CA-MRSAG belonged to two major clones: PFGE-type N-ST30-SCCmecIVc-t019-PVL(+) and PFGE-type I-ST5-IV-SCCmecIVa-t311-PVL(+) (45% each). The ST5-IV-PVL(+)/ST30-IV-PVL(+) clones have caused 31%/33% of all infections, 20%/4% of HAHO-, 43%/23% of HACO- and 35%/60% of CACO- infections, with significant differences by age groups (children/adults) and geographical regions. Importantly, an isolate belonging to USA300-0114-(ST8-SCCmecIVa-spat008-PVL(+)-ACME(+)) was detected for the first time in Argentina. Most of HA-MRSAG (66%) were related to the Cordobes/Chilean clone-(PFGE-type A-ST5-SCCmecI-t149) causing 18% of all infections (47% of HAHO- and 13% of HACO-infections). Results strongly suggest that the CA-MRSA clone ST5-IV-PVL(+) has begun to spread within hospitals, replacing the traditional Cordobes/Chilean-HA-MRSA clone ST5-I-PVL(-), mainly in children. Importantly, a growing MRSA reservoir in the community was associated with spreading of two CA-MRSA clones: ST5-IV-PVL(+), mainly in children with HRFs, and ST30-IV-PVL(+) in adults without HRFs. This is the first nationwide study in Argentina providing information about the molecular and clinical epidemiology of CA-MRSA, particularly within hospitals, which is essential for designing effective control measures in this country and worldwide."

A total of 1,428 isolates obtained from 338 patients and 322 control children were studied. The enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) adherence factor (EAF) probe was shown to be as good as the HEp-2 adhesion assay for the detection of typical EPEC strains. The DNA probes used to detect diffusely adhering E. coli and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) showed low sensitivities (64 and 50%, respectively), and the best method of identifying these organisms in clinical research remains the HEp-2 adherence assay. The ""bundle-forming pilus"" (BFP) and the EAEC PCR assays could be used instead of the DNA probes as a screening method for typical EPEC and EAEC carrying the EAEC probe sequence in the clinical laboratory. In our study, only typical EPEC strains that carried EAF and BFP were associated with acute diarrhea."

It analyses the trends in consultations for respiratory causes in three primary care centers and hospital discharges by comparing data from years 2008 and 2009 until epidemiological week 37.It also includes a study of cases of ILI / SARI (influenza like disease/severe acute respiratory disease) in which viruses were detected by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) of nasopharyngeal aspirates and by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the case of influenza A (H1N1) 2009. A household survey was conducted in those cases with confirmed A (H1N1) infection, to identify contacts and history related to influenza virus transmission. The results indicate that the behavior of the pandemic was similar to that observed in the rest of the country, with an increase in emergency room visits for ILI. The most affected age group was from 5 to 14 years (26.5 per thousand inhabitants) and the least affected 60 years or older (1.2 per thousand). A 2.78% of the cases corresponded to SARI and the fatality rate was 0.11%."

CD011926,0,7515257,0,HIV-1 reverse transcription in cord blood lymphocytes: implications for infection of newborns.,"We previously demonstrated that progeny virions are not produced after infection of adult quiescent peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Molecular analysis revealed that the nonproductive nature of this infection is due to failure to complete reverse transcription of the viral genome. In this study, we examined HIV-1 reverse transcription in quiescent lymphocytes from umbilical cord blood (CBLs). Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of reverse transcription intermediates, we found that as in PBLs from adults, reverse transcription is not completed in quiescent CBLs; instead, a partial reverse transcript is formed. Quantitative PCR analysis also showed that fewer partial reverse transcripts were found in CBLs than in PBLs. Although the relevance of this restriction in reverse transcription to vertical transmission is unclear, these data suggest that the rapid progression of disease in infected children is not due to increased permissiveness of the lymphocytes of newborns for HIV-1 infection."

By ELISA, subgroup and G serotype were determined for 59.5% and 28.6% of group A rotavirus-positive specimens respectively. However, of the 120 specimens, the G serotype of which was not determined by ELISA, serotype of the 112 specimens was typed by PCR. In total, G serotype was assigned for 95.2% of all the specimens, showing the highest rate of G4 (41.7%), followed by G1 (23.2%) and G2 (14.9%). Twenty-four specimens showed mixed types, such as G2 with G1, G8 or G9, or G1 with G4. These results indicate that PCR combined with ELISA is highly effective for G serotyping of rotavirus."
CD011926,0,17041549,0,Use of molecular tools to distinguish Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar infection among the aborigines in Cameron Highlands.,"Amoebiasis is an infectious diseased caused by parasitic one-celled protozoan called Entamoeba histolytica. Numerous protozoa also can inhabit the gastro-intestinal tract of human. Majority of these protozoa are non-pathogenic commensals or only causes disease under certain circumstances. Morphologically, E. histolytica, the invasive form, share the same characteristic with the nonpathogenic form, E. dispar. Both strains can be distinguished by using DNA identification. Many previous researches in Malaysia only reported infection with E. histolytica infection. Therefore in this study we tried to classify infection among the aborigines in Cameron Highland as true E. histolytica or E. dispar by Nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (Nested PCR) and Restriction enzyme (RE) digestion. Results showed that 31 samples were positive by microscopic examination, however of these 28 (13.2%) samples were positive for E. histolytica and 12 (5.6%) samples were positive for E. dispar by molecular tools."
CD011926,0,20498106,0,"HIV-1 vertical transmission in Rio Grande, Southern Brazil.","The aim of this study was to determine the rate and risk factors of HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), the timing of transmission and the transmitted subtype in a population where subtypes B and C co-circulate. One hundred and forty-four babies born to HIV-1-infected mothers were studied. Subtype and timing of transmission were determined by a nested polymerase chain reaction of the gp41 gene. Seven children were infected (4.9%): four were infected intrautero and one intrapartum. The higher frequency of intrautero transmission was statistically significant (P = 0.001). Use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) in the three stages of gestation was a protective risk factor for MTCT (PR = 0.42; CI: 0.21-0.83; P = 0.013). A higher HIV viral load at delivery was the only independent risk factor for MTCT. Early and universal access to ARVs during pregnancy are the most important measures to decrease vertical HIV-1 transmission even in areas where HIV clade distribution differs."

The aims of this study were to investigate the HPeV infection prevalence in infants <1 month in Spain and, secondly, to analyse the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the infected patients compared with those infected by enterovirus (EV). Infants <1 month with neurological or systemic symptoms were included in a multicentre prospective study. EV and HPeV detection by RT-PCR and genotyping were performed in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), sera or throat swabs. Out of the total of 84 infants studied during 2013, 32 were EV positive (38 %) and 9 HPeV positive (11 %). HPeV-3 was identified in eight cases and HPeV-5 in one. Mean age of HPeV-positive patients was 18 days. Diagnoses were fever without source (FWS) (67 %), clinical sepsis (22 %) and encephalitis (11 %). Leukocytes in blood and CSF were normal. Pleocytosis (p = 0.03) and meningitis (p = 0.001) were significantly more frequent in patients with EV infections than with HPeV."
CD011926,0,2424678,0,Laryngeal papillomatosis is associated with a defect in cellular differentiation.,"The effects of human papillomavirus infection, which can cause laryngeal papillomas, were studied in vitro in laryngeal stratified squamous epithelial cells. Interferon exposure had only minor effects on the outgrowth of primary cells from tissue fragments and the incorporation of tritiated amino acids by first-passage cells. There was a marked decrease in tritiated thymidine incorporation by papilloma cells when cultured in the presence of interferon, but no effect on thymidine incorporation by normal cells. Differentiation of laryngeal papillomas appears to be abnormal. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of keratins showed that the keratins of high relative molecular mass (Mr 51,000 and 59,000) associated with normal laryngeal differentiation were absent from papilloma tissue. Rather, both papilloma tissue and cultured papilloma cells contained a keratin of Mr 53,000 not normally present. Binding of the fluoresceinated lectin peanut agglutinin to cell surfaces suggested that there were alterations in the normal distribution of glycoproteins or glycolipids on papilloma tissues. Filaggrin, a protein synthesized by differentiating cells, was not detectable in most superficial papilloma cells after immunohistochemical staining. These studies strongly suggest that papilloma cells do not differentiate normally. We propose that this defect may be responsible for the hypertrophy of the tissue."

CD011926,0,25110117,0,A simple smart amplification assay for the rapid detection of human cytomegalovirus in the urine of neonates.,"Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of infection-related congenital abnormalities in neonates and the leading cause of non-hereditary sensorineural hearing loss in childhood. In addition, the number of low-birth-weight infants has recently increased, especially in Japan, in association with an increasing frequency of postnatal CMV infections transferred through raw breast milk. The increase in the number of congenital CMV and postnatal CMV infections in low-birth-weight infants requires rapid detection at the bedside in order to ensure a correct diagnosis and provide early anti-viral therapy. In this report, a simplified smart amplification (SMAP) method was developed to detect CMV in the urine of neonates. This method does not require DNA extraction, and the DNA amplification procedure is performed under isothermal conditions. Therefore, it takes only 60 min to detect CMV in a urine sample, and CMV DNA was rapidly detectable in symptomatic infants. In brief, this SMAP-based assay provides a simple, rapid and efficient method for detecting human CMV at the bedside."

The analytical performance and clinical validity of results generated with the novel Roche RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set using the LightCycler 2.0 instrument were characterized. Analytical performance was assessed by processing respiratory samples spiked with H1N1/09 and seasonal influenza A virus, a set of seasonal influenza A virus subtypes, and samples containing common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. The clinical validity of results was assessed in comparison to other assays by analyzing 359 specimens at three clinical sites and one reference laboratory. Direct sequencing was used to resolve samples with discrepant results. The assay detected virus concentrations down to <50 RNA copies per reverse transcription (RT)-quantitative PCR (qPCR). Various influenza A virus subtypes were covered. The analytical specificity was 100%. High clinical validity was demonstrated by the 99% positive agreement between seasonal influenza A viruses, 98% positive agreement between H1N1/09 viruses, and 88% agreement between negative results. The analytical sensitivity was compared to those of three other RT-qPCR assays and was found to be equivalent. The novel Roche RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set can be utilized on the widely used LightCycler platform. We demonstrate its usefulness for the rapid detection and surveillance of pandemic H1N1/09 influenza A virus infections."
CD011926,0,10558939,0,Virus levels in untreated African infants infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1.,"In developed areas, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected infants have high virus levels and rapidly progress to death. HIV levels were assessed in 1994-1997 in untreated infants in Malawi by analysis of dried blood spots tested by nucleic acid silica-bound amplification. Of 24 umbilical cord blood (CB)-positive samples, 83% had >10,000 copies/mL. The median virus level was 78,000 copies/mL. First positive sample median levels were 355,000 copies/mL among 52 perinatally infected infants and 130,000 copies/mL among 43 infants infected by breast-feeding. Virus levels were stable, and initial levels predicted levels 1 year after infection (P=.005), at which time levels did not significantly differ among in utero, perinatally, or postnatally infected infants. Thus, neither age at infection nor route of infection significantly influenced HIV levels measured 1 year after infection. Most (87%) CB-positive infants were infected before labor onset, since virus levels greatly exceeded those expected in their mothers."
CD011926,0,2209626,0,Typing of coagulase-negative staphylococci by Southern hybridization of chromosomal DNA fingerprints using a ribosomal RNA probe.,"Ribotyping consists of restriction endonuclease fingerprinting of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes visualized by Southern hybridization with an rRNA probe. This method was developed and compared with restriction endonuclease fingerprinting of chromosomal DNA for typing coagulase-negative staphylococci. Twenty-five American Type Culture Collection reference type strains and 53 clinical isolates were typed. Both methods clearly distinguished all 15 species of coagulase-negative staphylococci and most individual strains within each species. Except in the case of Staphylococcus warneri, ribotyping was most discriminating with the use of ClaI, one of eight endonucleases tested. HpaI and AvaI were more specific than ClaI for discrimination between strains of Staphylococcus warneri. The patterns produced by ribotyping were much simpler and thus easier to interpret than corresponding chromosomal fingerprints. However, ribotyping was slightly less discriminating. It is concluded that ribotyping offers an alternative method for molecular typing of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The application of both methods needs to be further evaluated in the clinical setting."

Over the past decade, New York State has moved from a policy of blind newborn screening for seroprevalence data to mandatory HIV testing as part of the statewide Newborn Screening (NBS) Program. A new statewide program of expedited HIV testing (48-hr turnaround results) of pregnant women and newborns (whose HIV status is unknown at the time of delivery) began in the summer of 1999. To better understand the impact this program might have on the patients who receive health care at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center (Lincoln Hospital), we evaluated our experience with the current NBS program prior to inauguration of the new expedited testing program. We evaluated the NBS program from February 1, 1997, to January 31, 1999, including total number of HIV-exposed/infected infants born, mother's HIV status (if known) at the time of delivery, amount of time between blood sampling and return of the test results to the Hospital, and medical follow-up of infants with positive newborn screening test results. This was a retrospective study of the NBS registry and the medical records of patients who receive primary health care from the Pediatric Immunology Service of the Department of Pediatrics at Lincoln Hospital. One hundred and four newborns were identified with positive-HIV antibody (HIV-Ab-positive), and 13 (12.5%) were confirmed to be HIV-infected by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of viral DNA. Sixty-five (62.5%) of the newborns with positive NBS screening test results were born to mothers who were known to be HIV-infected prior to delivery; 39 (37.5%) were unanticipated. Four (30%) of the 13 HIV-infected babies were born to mothers who were known to be HIV-infected prior to delivery, and 9 (70%) were born to mothers whose HIV status was unknown at the time of delivery. Eighty percent (80%) of HIV-Ab-positive infants continued to receive follow-up care at Lincoln Hospital. Relocation to other health-care facilities occurred as a result of parental choice or due to foster care placement. No babies were ""lost"" from the NBS program. The average time between sampling and receipt of results for all blood tests was 16 days (range 10 to 141). Nearly 40% of newborns who acquired HIV infection from their mothers were unanticipated because the mother's HIV status was unknown at the time of delivery. These unanticipated HIV-infected infants represent missed opportunities for prevention of maternal-to-child transmission of HIV infection and early therapeutic intervention for HIV-infected infants. The new expedited HIV-testing program for New York State will facilitate early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the HIV-exposed/infected infant for whom maternal HIV status is unknown at the time of delivery."
CD011926,0,23959917,0,Virological diagnosis and management of two cases of congenital measles.,"Measles is a highly contagious viral infection causing congenital infections with a risk of neurological complications in the newborn. Two cases of measles, which occurred in pregnant women within 14 days before the delivery, are described. Mother-to-child transmission of the virus was documented in the newborns either by RT-PCR in saliva or by IgM detection in blood. The measles strains evidenced in saliva samples were genotyped and belonged to the D4 Genotype. An early viral RT-PCR detection allowed successful immunoglobulin prophylaxis in one newborn taking into account that the duration between the onset of the skin rash in the mother and the delivery was less than 6 days. Twenty-four months later, none of the newborns developed classical or neurological clinical signs of measles infection. Measles RT-PCR assay in salivary samples can be used before symptoms develop in the infant to confirm early mother-to-child transmission, therefore permitting the use of an immunoglobulin prophylaxis in the newborn."

Respiratory clinical specimens received between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012 were analysed. Respiratory virus testing was performed using a large panel of real-time PCR or RT-PCR. Results were analysed according to sample type (upper versus lower respiratory tract) and age group. In all, 2996 (2469 (82.4%) upper; 527 (17.6%) lower) specimens were analysed. Overall positivity rate was 47.4% and 23.7% for upper and lower respiratory samples, respectively. The highest positivity rate was observed in patients under 18 years old (p <0.001); picornaviruses were the most frequent viruses detected over the year. Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses showed a seasonal peak during the winter season, while picornaviruses and adenoviruses were less frequently detected in these periods. Multiple viral infections were identified in 12% of positive cases and were significantly more frequent in children (p <0.001). In conclusion, we observed significant differences in viral infection rates and virus types among age groups, clinical sample types and seasons. Follow-up of viral detection over several seasons allows a better understanding of respiratory viral epidemiology."

The most common (17/ 41) serotype was Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, followed by S. enterica serotype Isangi (16/41), S. enterica serotype Saint-paul (2/41), S. enterica serotype Kissi (2/41), S. enterica serotype Kivu (2/41), and S. enterica serotype Reading (1/41). All isolates were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and aztreonam but susceptible to meropenem. SHV-12 found in 39% of the isolates was the most common ESBL. TEM-63 was produced in 29% and TEM-116 in 10% of the isolates, and TEM-131 was found in 1 isolate. Other ESBLs that were identified included SHV-2 (n = 2), CTX-M-3 (n = 1), CTX-M-15 (n = 2), and CTX-M-37 (n = 5). In addition, CMY-2 (n = 3) and the OXA-1(n = 1) beta-lactamase were also detected. The diversity of ESBLs suggests that its incidence in Salmonellae needs to be monitored."
CD011926,0,7939235,0,[Human immunodeficiency virus infection in children].,"Four hundred to 600 pregnancies have now been carried to full-term by HIV seropositive women in France. The rate of transmission of the virus to the infant is around 20%, and there remains much uncertainty concerning the exact mechanism involved. Early diagnostic methods are based on isolating the virus in culture or PCR but the sensitivity of this test is only 50% at birth, although rising to nearly 100% by 6 months of age. In the infant, the main characteristic of the disease is the existence of a subgroup (comprising 15 to 20% of the patients) that develops AIDS early, in association with opportunistic infection and encephalopathy in the first months of life. Treatment choices remain very limited, with the hope of eventual prevention of maternal-fetal transmission. The gravity of the ensuing psychological and social problems calls for a multidisciplinary approach to the infant, family and relatives."

To analyse the clinical features and the temporal frequency in acute adenoviral respiratory infections in hospitalized children in southern Taiwan, a total of 4333 children who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiaokang (KMHK) Hospital, with clinical evidences of acute respiratory infections between January 2001 and December 2002 were studied. Adenoviruses were isolated from 317 patients with an isolation rate of 7.67 per cent. Serotype analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 186 specimens. In 2001, adenovirus type 4 was found in the majority (57 per cent), followed by type 1.5.6 (15 per cent), type 2 (13 per cent), type 14 (8 per cent), type 3 (5 per cent), and type 7 (2 per cent). In 2002, type 3 became the major type (46 per cent), whereas the previously predominant type 4 decreased to 6 per cent, and type 7 increased from 2 to 19 per cent. The symptoms and signs included fever (98.7 percent), cough (77.6 per cent), abnormal breathing sounds (crackles and/or wheezing 23.3 per cent), abdominal pain (18.9 per cent), vomiting (21.8 per cent), and diarrhea (25.2 per cent). The mean duration of fever was 4.8 days (range 0-19 days).

After documenting thrombocytopoenia in a HIV-exposed neonate, who was subsequently shown not to be infected, we evaluated thrombocytopoenia (platelets < 150 x 10(9)/l) as a marker for HIV exposure in newborns. This is, to our knowledge, the first study of thrombocytopoenia in HIV-exposed neonates. A retrospective hospital-based descriptive study was performed over an 18-month period (July 1997-December 1998). Patients were recruited either through identification of known HIV-positive mothers or neonates with thrombocytopoenia who were then screened for HIV exposure. For eligibility, neonates with either HIV antibodies or direct evidence of infection (p24 antigenaemia or HIV RNA detected by polymerase chain reaction after 1 month of age) were included. Thirty-four HIV-exposed (HIV-ELISA positive) neonates were identified, of whom 16 (47 per cent) had thrombocytopenia. In 12 (35 per cent), no underlying cause other than HIV was identified. Nine thrombocytopoenic babies were infected and seven uninfected. Unexplained thrombocytopoenia, while an imperfect marker, should alert the physician to the possibility of HIV exposure. It does not necessarily imply HIV infection. A prospective study is recommended to evaluate further the sensitivity and specificity of this marker."
CD011926,0,14657763,0,Performance characteristics of HIV-1 culture and HIV-1 DNA and RNA amplification assays for early diagnosis of perinatal HIV-1 infection.,"A plasma HIV-1 RNA amplification assay (RNA assay), a quantitative peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) microculture (culture), and a PBMC HIV-1 DNA amplification assay (DNA assay) were compared for diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants receiving zidovudine in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 185; assays were performed for all 24 infected and 100 uninfected infants. HIV-1 infection was defined as >or=2 positive cultures or positive antibody to HIV-1 at >or=18 months. Cultures were performed at birth and 6 and 24 weeks of age; DNA and RNA assays were performed on cryopreserved specimens. The sensitivity of culture and DNA and RNA assays at birth was 20.8%, 10.5%, and 26.7%, respectively. At older ages, sensitivity typically exceeded 80%, remaining highest for the RNA assay (>85%). Assay specificity was >99%. Positive predictive values exceeded 93% for each assay at each age; negative predictive values were highest (>90%) for the RNA assay. At birth (P < 0.005) and age 6 weeks (P < 0.001), a significantly larger proportion of infected infants were identified by means of the RNA assay than by the other assays. The diagnostic performance of the RNA assay matched or exceeded that of culture and the DNA assay. Given that RNA assays require less blood volume and yield rapid results, our study adds to existing data suggesting that RNA assays may be used for early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants."

The RT-PCR method was sensitive enough to detect a 0.1 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per milliliter by nested PCR. The RSV antigen was detected from the samples at more than 100 TCID50 per milliliter by EIA. Nine patients were positive for the presence of RSV genome by first PCR on the day of admission, and eight were also positive by nested PCR even on the fifth hospital day. Among nine PCR positives, four patients were positive for EIA and five for virus isolation. No cases were serologically diagnosed. The cases that were negative for RT-PCR were also negative according to the other methods. In the clinical setting, the RT-PCR assay is more useful for diagnosis of RSV infection than other methods when the suspected cases are negative by EIA assay."

The Xpert EV assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) is a rapid, fully automated real-time PCR test for the detection of enterovirus RNA that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic use in March 2007. In this multicenter trial we established the clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert EV assay in patients presenting with meningitis symptoms relative to clinical truth. Clinical truth for enteroviral meningitis was defined as clinical evidence of meningitis, the absence of another detectable pathogen in CSF, and detection of enterovirus in CSF either by two reference NAATs or by viral culture. A total of 199 prospectively and 235 retrospectively collected specimens were eligible for inclusion in this study. The overall prevalence of enteroviral meningitis was 26.04%. The Xpert EV assay had a sensitivity of 94.69% (90% confidence interval [CI] = 89.79 to 97.66%), specificity of 100% (90% CI = 99.07 to 100%), positive predictive value of 100%, negative predictive value of 98.17, and an accuracy of 98.62% relative to clinical truth. The Xpert EV assay demonstrated a high degree of accuracy for diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis. The simplicity and on-demand capability of the Xpert EV assay should prove to be a valuable adjunct to the evaluation of suspected meningitis cases."
CD011926,0,26167819,0,"[Prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses in patients with acute respiratory tract infections, 2002-2014].","The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses in pediatric and adult outpatients and inpatients who were admitted to hospital with the symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, during a 12-year period. A total of 5102 clinical samples (4372 nasopharyngeal swabs, 316 bronchoalveolar lavages, 219 transtracheal aspirates, 163 nasopharyngeal aspirates, 20 sputum, 10 nasal swabs) examined in our laboratory between January 1st 2002 and July 17th 2014, were evaluated retrospectively. Of the specimens, 1107 (21.7%) were obtained from outpatients and 3995 (78.3%) from hospitalized patients. Of the patients, 2851 (55.9%) were male and 2251 (44.1%) were female, while 1233 (24.2%) were adults and 3869 (75.8%) were children (age range: 1 day - 93 years; median: 3 years). Respiratory samples were investigated for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A and B (INF-A, INF-B), adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV types 1-4), human rhinoviruses (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). All specimens were tested by both direct immunofluorescence antibody (DFA) and shell vial cell culture (SVCC) methods. In DFA assay the samples were initially screened by fluorescent-labeled polyclonal antibodies, and the positive ones were typed by using monoclonal antibodies (Light Diagnostics, Merck Millipore, USA). In SVCC, HEp-2, MDCK, A-549 and Vero cell lines were used for the isolation of viruses. In addition to these methods, real-time multiplex PCR methods (RealAccurate®, Respiratory RT PCR, PathoFinder, Netherlands and Seeplex® RV15 ACE Detection, Seegene, South Korea) were used for the detection of respiratory viruses in samples (n= 2104) obtained from 2007 to 2014. Respiratory viruses were detected in a total of 1705 (33.4%) patients, of them 967 (19%) were male and 738 (14.4%) were female. Three hundred and eighteen (18.6%) of the 1705 patients were infected with multiple respiratory viruses. The most frequently observed co-infections were RSV+INF-A (40/318; 12.6%), and RSV+PIV (33/318; 10.4%). The rate of positivity for the respiratory viruses in pediatric and adult groups were 35.4% (1369/3869) and 27.3% (336/1233), respectively (p< 0.000). The most frequently detected virus in pediatric group was RSV (336/1369; 24.5%), followed by influenza viruses (314/1369; 22.9%), PIV (197/1369; 14.4%), HRV (118/1369; 8.6%), AdV (75/1369; 5.5%) and the others (49/1369; 3.6%). On the other hand the most frequently detected virus in adult group was influenza viruses (181/336; 53.8%) followed by AdV (37/336; 11%), RSV (24/336; 7.1%), PIV (24/336; 7.1%), HRV (23/336; 6.8%) and the others (9/336; 2.7%). The rate of multiple virus infections in pediatric and adult groups were 7.2% (280/3869) and 3% (38/1233), respectively. Most of the coinfections (280/318; 88%) were detected in children. Respiratory viruses were detected positive in 40.2% (445/1107) of outpatients, and in 31.5% (1260/3995) of inpatients (p< 0.000). The most frequent viruses detected in pediatric outpatients and inpatients were HRV and RSV, respectively, while influenza viruses were the first in line among both adult outpatients and inpatients. During the study period, a PIV-3 outbreak (n= 96) have emerged between December 2004-April 2005, and an influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 outbreak (n= 207) between November 2009-January 2010. When the seasonal distribution was considered, the isolation rates of 1705 respiratory viruses in winter, spring, summer and autumn were 44.4%, 27%, 8.3% and 20.3%, respectively. RSV was most frequently detected from December to March, influenza viruses from November to March, HRV from December to June, and mixed infections from January to February. In conclusion, the data of our study obtained in about 12-year period indicated that the prevalence of respiratory viruses in acute respiratory infections is 33.4%, and they typically active during the months of winter and early spring in our region."

In Mayotte, concurrent with an enhanced passive case notification system, we carried out two surveys. A seroprevalence survey designed to document recent CHIK infection was conducted on serum samples collected from pregnant women in October 2005 (n=316) and in March-April 2006 (n=629). A cross-sectional clinical community survey carried out from 2 to 10 May 2006 among 2235 individuals was designed to determine the cumulative incidence of presumptive CHIK fever cases. The seroprevalence of recent infection among pregnant women was 1.6% in October 2005 and rose to 26% in April 2006. The clinical community survey showed that nearly 26% of respondents had experienced presumptive CHIK fever between January and May 2006. Extrapolated to the overall population of Mayotte, these figures lead to an estimated attack rate of 249.5 cases per 1000 population as of early May 2006. Nine patients with the maternofetal form and six subjects with the severe form were recorded. This first emergence of CHIK fever in Mayotte lead to a very large outbreak. Efforts to strengthen surveillance and prevention of arbovirus infection are needed at country and regional levels."
CD011926,0,17685342,0,Comparison of three chromogenic media and evaluation of two molecular-based identification systems for the detection of Enterobacter sakazakii from environmental samples from infant formulae factories.,"Enterobacter sakazakii is an occasional contaminant of powdered infant formula that can cause rare but severe foodborne infections in infants. To determine optimal methods for the detection and identification of E. sakazakii, 38 naturally contaminated samples from infant formulae factories were analyzed by two PCR-based methods and by a method (TS 22964/RM 210) developed by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Dairy Federation (ISO-IDF) using three different commercial chromogenic agars. The ISO-IDF method includes two enrichment steps, plating of the second enrichment broth on E. sakazakii isolation agar (a chromogenic selective agar), picking of five typical colonies for transfer onto tryptone soy agar, and subsequent confirmation of yellow-pigmented colonies by biochemical characterization. Twenty-two of the 38 samples were positive by the culture method. E. sakazakii isolation agar (ESIA; AES Laboratoires), COMPASS agar (Biokar Diagnostics), and Druggan-Forsythe-Iversen agar (Oxoid) compared favorably with violet red bile glucose agar (VRBG, a selective medium for Enterobacteriaceae), with positive predictive values of 86.96, 88, and 74.07%, respectively, in contrast to 47.83% for VRBG. One additional positive sample was detected using the nonpatented real-time PCR method evaluated, and those results were in 97.3% concordance with the ISO-IDF results. Some discrepancies between the results of the DuPont Qualicon BAX system and those of the ISO-IDF method could be explained by heterogeneity of contamination and sampling. Thus, both PCR-based systems were suitable for detecting and specifically identifying E. sakazakii within 1 to 2 days, and COMPASS agar and ESIA could be used interchangeably as a first-step medium to isolate presumptive E. sakazakii colonies."
CD011926,0,15155979,0,Evaluation of a malaria rapid diagnostic test for assessing the burden of malaria during pregnancy.,"Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy may cause placental malaria and subsequently low birth weight, primarily through the placental sequestration of infected red blood cells. Measuring the burden of malaria during pregnancy usually involves determining the prevalence of placental malaria infection through microscopic examination of placental blood films, a difficult and error-prone process. A number of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria have been developed, most of them immunochromatographic dipstick assays. However, none have been tested for the direct determination of malaria antigen in placental blood. We undertook an evaluation of the Malaria Rapid Test (MAKROmed in determining placental malaria infection. The prevalence of placental parasitemia was 22.6% by microscopy, 51.0% by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and 43.1% by RDT. When the PCR was used as the gold standard, RDTs had a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 76%. The MAKROmed RDT was highly sensitive in the detection of placental malaria, but had lower than expected specificity."

CD011926,0,20305050,0,False-positive IgM for CMV in pregnant women with autoimmune disease: a novel prognostic factor for poor pregnancy outcome.,"Our aims were to assess the frequency of false-positive IgM antibodies for cytomegalovirus in pregnant women with autoimmune diseases and in healthy women (controls) and to determine their relationship with pregnancy outcome. Data from 133 pregnancies in 118 patients with autoimmune diseases and from 222 pregnancies in 198 controls were assessed. When positive IgM for cytomegalovirus was detected, IgG avidity, cytomegalovirus isolation and polymerase chain reaction for CMV-DNA in maternal urine and amniotic fluid samples were performed in order to identify primary infection or false positivity. A statistically significantly higher rate of false-positive IgM was found in pregnancies with autoimmune diseases (16.5%) in comparison with controls (0.9%). A worse pregnancy outcome was observed among patients with autoimmune disease and false cytomegalovirus IgM in comparison with those without false positivity: earlier week of delivery (p = 0.017), lower neonatal birth weight (p = 0.0004) and neonatal birth weight percentile (p = 0.002), higher rate of intrauterine growth restriction (p = 0.02) and babies weighing less than 2000 g (p = 0.025) were encountered. The presence of false cytomegalovirus IgM in patients with autoimmune diseases could be used as a novel prognostic index of poor pregnancy outcome: it may reflect a non-specific activation of the immune system that could negatively affect pregnancy outcome.

CD011926,0,19545396,0,Perinatal transmission of human papilomavirus DNA.,"The purpose was to study the perinatal transmission of human papillomavirus DNA (HPV-DNA) in 63 mother-newborn pairs, besides looking at the epidemiological factors involved in the viral DNA transmission. The following sampling methods were used: (1) in the pregnant woman, when was recruited, in cervix and clinical lesions of the vagina, vulva and perineal region; (2) in the newborn, (a) buccal, axillary and inguinal regions; (b) nasopharyngeal aspirate, and (c) cord blood; (3) in the children, buccal was repeated in the 4th week and 6th and 12th month of life. HPV-DNA was identified using two methodologies: multiplex PCR (PGMY09 and MY11 primers) and nested-PCR (genotypes 6/11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 42, 52 and 58). Perinatal transmission was considered when concordance was found in type-specific HPV between mother/newborn or mother/child. HPV-DNA genital was detected in 49 pregnant women submitted to delivery. Eleven newborns (22.4%, n = 11/49) were HPV-DNA positive. In 8 cases (16.3%, n = 8/49) there was type specific HPV concordance between mother/newborn samples. At the end of the first month of life three children (6.1%, n = 3/49) became HPV-DNA positive, while two remained positive from birth. In 3 cases (100%, n = 3/3) there was type specific HPV concordance between mother/newborn samples. In the 6th month, a child (2%, n = 1/49) had become HPV-DNA positive between the 1st and 6th month of life, and there was type specific HPV concordance of mother/newborn samples. All the HPV-DNA positive children (22.4%, n = 11/49) at birth and at the end first month of life (6.1%, n = 3/49) became HPV-DNA negative at the age of 6 months. The HPV-DNA positive child (2%, n = 1/49) from 1st to the 6th month of life became HPV-DNA negative between the 6th and 12th month of life and one child had anogenital warts. In the twelfth month all (100%, n = 49/49) the children studied were HPV-DNA negative. A positive and significant correlation was observed between perinatal transmission of HPV-DNA and the immunodepression of maternal variables (HIV, p = 0.007). Finally, the study suggests that perinatal transmission of HPV-DNA occurred in 24.5% (n = 12/49) of the cases studied."

Archived stools positive for either different types or variants of norovirus genogroups I and II or other enteric viruses were used to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the novel assay. The TRC assay was 100% specific since it detected all the noroviruses tested and it did not display cross reactivity with other enteric viruses. When screening a collection of 387 stools with the TRC and RT-nPCR assays, the TRC displayed concordance, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 96.6%, 81%, 99.7%, 98.1%, and 96.3%, respectively, after retesting the negative specimens. Additional PCRs and/or sequencing, used to understand inconsistent results between TRC and RT-nPCR, confirmed all positive results and did not reveal nucleotide variations in the TRC probe and primers binding sites. The TRC assay may be a rapid and ease of use tool for the detection of noroviruses in clinical virology laboratories even in the face of rapidly evolving noroviruses."

CD011926,0,25023717,0,The prevalence of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes among coagulase negative staphylococci in Iranian pediatric patients.,"In spite of widespread emergence of aminoglycoside resistance, these drugs are still used in the treatment of staphylococcal infections. This study aimed to investigate the distribution of aminoglycoside resistance and genes encoding aminoglycoside - modifying enzymes (AMEs) as well as Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) type in coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) in pediatric patients. Totally, 93 CoNS isolates were examined for susceptibility to aminoglycosides using disk diffusion and/or E-test methods. AMEs genes and SCCmec types were detected using multiplex PCR. Strain typing was performed using repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) - PCR assay. The non-susceptibility rates to kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin were 73%, 59%, 49.5%, 16% and 7.5%, respectively. aac(6')-Ie-aph(2″)-Ia, ant(4')-Ia and aph(3')-IIIa were encountered in 56 (60.2%), 38 (40.8%) and 18 (19.3%) isolates, respectively. In aac(6')-Ie-aph(2″)-Ia- positive isolates, the non- susceptibility rates to kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin and netilmicin were 83%, 74%, 73%, 49% and 43%, respectively. SCCmec types included type IV (n = 31), I (n = 17), II (n = 5), III (n = 4), and V (n = 2). Three isolates had two types; I + III (n = 2) and III + IV (n = 1) whereas 11 isolates were non-typeable. AMEs genes carriers were distributed frequently into type IV. We found diverse fingerprint patterns among our isolates. In conclusion, there was a strong correlation between alarming rate of aminoglycoside resistance and methicillin resistance. Discordances between phenotypic and genotypic detection of aminoglycoside resistance were discernible. AMEs genes might be related to SCCmec types."
CD011926,0,16310405,0,Rubella in pregnancy: intrauterine transmission and perinatal outcome during a Brazilian epidemic.,"Sixty pregnant women with clinical signs of rubella and specific rubella antibodies were studied between January 1999 and December 2002 in order to determine the intrauterine rubella transmission rate and the presence of the virus in amniotic fluid and fetal tissues by nested PCR. Thirty-three patients presented rubella before 12 weeks of gestation and 27 after 12 weeks. Gestational age at the time of acute rubella was determined on the basis of the date of last menstruation and the first trimester ultrasound scan. Thirteen patients with clinical features of rubella before 12 weeks of gestation were submitted to amniocentesis. Three products of conception were analyzed. The presence of the rubella virus was determined by nested PCR. IgM and IgG antibodies were analyzed in neonatal samples at birth and at 3 months of age using a capture immunoassay. Newborn follow-up was based on the presence of congenital rubella syndrome-compatible defects, anti-rubella antibodies, echocardiographic alterations, brainstem evoked response audiometry, and ophthalmological pathology. Five miscarriages and four fetal deaths were observed in the group of patients presenting clinical features before 12 weeks of gestation. IgM antibodies were detected in seven neonates at birth and at 3 months of age. Deafness was observed in three cases and pigmentary retinopathy in one case. Fourteen of the 16 samples (13 amniotic fluid and 3 fetal tissue samples) submitted to virological analysis tested positive. Four fetal deaths, five miscarriages (one with negative virology) and seven newborns with anti-rubella IgM at birth and/or at 3 months age were observed in the group with rubella before 12 weeks of gestation. There were three cases in which virological analysis of the amniotic fluid samples was positive (infected) while the newborn showed no signs of congenital rubella syndrome and anti-rubella IgM were absent. When maternal rubella occurred after 12 weeks of gestation, no fetal or neonatal rubella signs were observed. Eradication of congenital rubella syndrome is possible since vaccination campaigns continue and all services related to the health care of children, adolescents and women have become aware of the significance of the problem and are collaborating. All pregnant women in Brazil should be screened for the rubella antibody and the susceptible group should be vaccinated after giving birth."
CD011926,0,23877774,0,[Presence of Bordetella holmesii in an outbreak of pertussis in Chile].,"The incidence of whooping cough in Chile ranges from 4.1 and 7.5 per hundred thousand inhabitants. B. pertussis detection is performed by Real Time PCR (Q-PCR) directed to the insertion sequence IS481. However, this sequence is also found in the genome of B. bronchiseptica and B. holmesii. The latter is also a respiratory pathogen whose clinical features are similar to B. pertussis. However, it is important to differentiate between these species because in immunosuppressed patients B. holmesii is more likely to cause bacteremia and is less susceptible to erythromycin. The goal of this work is to measure prospectively and retrospectively the presence of B. holmesii in samples reported positive for B. pertussis in the period 2010-2011. During this period, 1994 nasopharyngeal specimens entered the laboratory for Bordetella sp. PCR, of which 224 were positive. The analysis by Q-PCR directed to the recA gene of B. holmesii of all 224 positive samples determined a prevalence of B. holmesii of 0.6% (12/1994). Because of its more aggressive behavior in immunosupressed patients and its different resistance pattern, routine screening of B. pertussis and B. holmesii is currently performed for all samples in which Bordetella sp PCR is initially detected."

CD011926,0,10935989,0,Human herpesvirus 6 infection after living related liver transplantation.,"The aim of the study was to investigate human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) infection after liver transplantation from living related donors, and to evaluate the reliability of the presence of HHV-6 DNA in plasma by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for monitoring active HHV-6 infection. EDTA peripheral blood was collected from 47 donor and recipient (16 males and 31 females, age 1-320 months) pairs at the time of transplantation and biweekly from these recipients after transplantation until 2 months after operation. Isolation of HHV-6 and serological assays were carried out to evaluate active HHV-6 infection in this study. The presence of the viral DNA in plasma was tested by nested PCR. Four clinical events, such as unexplained fever, thrombocytopenia, rejection, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement, were evaluated for clinical features of the virus infection. Risk factors for the virus activity after liver transplantation were also examined. HHV-6 activity was detected in 23 (49%) of the 47 recipients approximately 2-4 weeks after transplantation. All 9 isolates were HHV-6 variant B. The presence of the viral DNA in plasma correlated well with virus isolation and serology (P < 0.01). Only unexplained fever was associated statistically with HHV-6 activity after liver transplantation (P < 0. 01). If the recipient was seronegative to HHV-6 before transplantation, the recipient was more likely to develop the active virus infection after liver transplantation (P = 0.11). HHV-6 activity occurred in one-half of the recipients approximately 2-4 weeks after liver transplantation, and there was a close association between HHV-6 activity and unexplained fever following transplantation. Detection of the viral DNA in plasma by PCR is useful for monitoring active HHV-6 infection in these patients. Seronegative recipients were more likely to have evidence of active HHV-6 infection after liver transplantation."

This study reports the molecular epidemiology of C. difficile obtained from hospitalized patients in Chile. Seven hundred and nineteen isolates of toxigenic C. difficile from 45 hospitals across the country were characterized through toxin profile, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and sequencing of the tcdC gene. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed on a subset of selected strains. PFGE typing of 719 isolates of C. difficile produced 60 PFGE patterns (subtypes). Subtype 1 was predominant (79% of isolates) and related to the hypervirulent strain (NAP1). Subtype 1 showed 73% relatedness with nine other subtypes, which had a similar tcdC deletion. Subtype 1 corresponded to ribotype 027 and ST1. This report shows the wide dissemination of the hypervirulent strain NAP1/027/ST1 in Chile."
CD011926,0,26540236,0,"Molecular Characterization of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus in the Philippines, 2012-2013.","Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children worldwide. We performed molecular analysis of HRSV among infants and children with clinical diagnosis of severe pneumonia in four study sites in the Philippines, including Biliran, Leyte, Palawan, and Metro Manila from June 2012 to July 2013. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and screened for HRSV using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Positive samples were tested by conventional PCR and sequenced for the second hypervariable region (2nd HVR) of the G gene. Among a total of 1,505 samples, 423 samples were positive for HRSV (28.1%), of which 305 (72.1%) and 118 (27.9%) were identified as HRSV-A and HRSV-B, respectively. Two genotypes of HRSV-A, NA1 and ON1, were identified during the study period. The novel ON1 genotype with a 72-nucleotide duplication in 2nd HVR of the G gene increased rapidly and finally became the predominant genotype in 2013 with an evolutionary rate higher than the NA1 genotype. Moreover, in the ON1 genotype, we found positive selection at amino acid position 274 (p<0.05) and massive O- and N-glycosylation in the 2nd HVR of the G gene. Among HRSV-B, BA9 was the predominant genotype circulating in the Philippines. However, two sporadic cases of GB2 genotype were found, which might share a common ancestor with other Asian strains. These findings suggest that HRSV is an important cause of severe acute respiratory infection among children in the Philippines and revealed the emergence and subsequent predominance of the ON1 genotype and the sporadic detection of the GB2 genotype. Both genotypes were detected for the first time in the Philippines."

CD011926,0,17719686,0,An outbreak of Halomonas phocaeensis sp. nov. bacteraemia in a neonatal intensive care unit.,"Unidentified Gram-negative aerobic rods were recovered from the blood cultures of six neonates in a neonatal intensive care facility in Tunis, Tunisia. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that these were members of the Halomonas genus, with <97% sequence similarity to their closest relative. The observation of unique phenotypic characteristics of these organisms supported a novel species and the name Halomonas phocaeensis sp. nov. was proposed. A case-control study and conditional logistic regression analysis suggested that the administration of fresh frozen plasma was the only independent risk factor for developing H. phocaeensis bacteraemia. Observational studies indicated that fresh frozen plasma was warmed up using a water-bath. This first description of a nosocomial outbreak of H. phocaeensis bacteraemia illustrates the infection risks associated with poorly controlled water hygiene in healthcare settings."
CD011926,0,16544246,0,Characteristics and acquisition of human herpesvirus (HHV) 7 infections in relation to infection with HHV-6.,"Although both human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 and HHV-7 infections are ubiquitous during childhood, few acute HHV-7 infections are identified. It is unknown whether HHV-7 viremia indicates primary infection, as with HHV-6, or reactivation, and if these differ clinically. We studied, in otherwise healthy children < or =10 years old, HHV-7 and HHV-6 infections and their interaction by serologic assessment, viral isolation, and polymerase chain reaction. In children < or =24 months of age, HHV-7 infections occurred less often than HHV-6 infections (P< or =.002). Of 2806 samples from 2365 children < or =10 years old, 30 (1%) showed evidence of HHV-7 viremia; 23 (77%) of these were primary and 7 (23%) were reactivated HHV-7 infections. Four (13%) showed concurrent HHV-6 viremia, 2 associated with primary HHV-7 infections. The clinical manifestations of primary and reactivated HHV-7 infections were similar, except that seizures occurred more frequently in reactivated infections. These findings, previously unrecognized in otherwise healthy children, suggest that HHV-7 viremia could represent primary or reactivated infection and may be affected by the interaction between HHV-6 and HHV-7."
CD011926,0,2065890,0,Mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus.,"Transmission of HIV virus from an infected mother to her offspring is becoming the leading cause of spreading in the pediatric population. This is particularly burdensome in the pattern II countries where HIV infection has reached epidemic proportions and infection rates affect more women of childbearing age than men. During the last few years considerable effort has been directed at defining the optimal methods for identifying infants of HIV-infected mothers who will themselves prove to be infected because conventional serological assessment is impaired due to placental transfer of maternal IgG. At present, detection of specific IgA to HIV proteins, evaluation of autochthonous antibody production in vitro from infants' lymphocytes, and gene amplification of HIV DNA/RNA by polymerase chain reaction are the most promising procedures for early diagnosis within the first 6 months of life. Nevertheless all these techniques are cumbersome when evaluating specimens from the newborn child. Many studies have been performed to identify those maternal factors affecting the risk of vertical transmission. So far, none of them has shown real prognostic value. However, evaluation of maternal antibody response to functional epitopes of HIV envelope proteins such as the principal neutralizing domain, in some epidemiological settings, seems to correlate to a reduced rate of mother-to-child transmission."

Because of the persistence of maternal HIV antibodies, virologic assays that directly detect HIV are required to diagnose HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months of age. The sensitivity of HIV RNA/DNA assays increases as the child becomes older. These tests have specificity values greater than 95%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the COBAS Taqman HIV-1 Test, v1.0 assay (Roche) and its concordance with a Multiplex Nested-PCR. Of 341 samples processed, 15 were positive and 326 negative by both methods. Sensitivity and specificity overall values for the viral load assay were 88.2% and 100%, respectively. Our results indicate that the COBAS Taqman assay evaluated could be used as an alternative method to diagnose HIV congenital infection."

CD011926,0,2984247,0,Serotypic characterization of rotaviruses derived from asymptomatic human neonatal infections.,"Nineteen rotavirus strains derived from asymptomatic neonates (seven from England, five from Australia, two from Venezuela, and five from Sweden) were successfully cultivated in primary African green monkey kidney cell cultures, serotyped by plaque reduction neutralization tests, subgrouped by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and electropherotyped by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All 19 strains were shown to fall into one of the four known human serotypes; serotype 1 (all Venezuelan strains), serotype 2 (all Swedish strains), serotype 3 (all Australian strains), or serotype 4 (all English strains). Hyperimmune guinea pig serum raised against the Venezuelan strain (M37) neutralized not only serotype 1 (strain Wa) but also serotype 4 (strain St. Thomas no. 3) viruses to a similar degree. The English, Australian, and Venezuelan isolates were found to belong to subgroup 2, and the Swedish strains were subgroup 1 viruses. The potential importance of these rotaviruses obtained from neonates as possible vaccine candidates is discussed."
CD011926,0,24329944,0,Short duration of lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis B virus transmission in pregnancy: lack of potency and selection of resistance mutations.,"This study sought to assess the antiviral efficacy of lamivudine (LMV) administered during third trimester to reduce maternal viraemia and to identify the emergence of LMV resistance. A prospective observational analysis was performed on 26 mothers with high viral load (>10⁷ IU/mL). Twenty-one women received LMV (treated group) for an average of 53 days (range 22-88 days), and the remaining five formed the untreated control group. Serum samples from two time points were used to measure HBV DNA levels and antiviral drug resistance. The LMV-treated women achieved a median HBV DNA reduction of 2.6-log10 IU/mL. Although end-of-treatment (EOT) HBV DNA in four (18%) LMV-treated women remained at >10(7) IU/mL (± 0.5 log IU/mL), no mother-to-baby transmission was observed. In contrast, a baby from the untreated mother was HBsAg positive at 9 months postpartum. Four technologies were used for drug resistance testing. Only ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) was sufficiently sensitive to detect minor viral variants down to <1%. UDPS showed that LMV therapy resulted in increased viral quasispecies diversity and positive selection of HBV variants with reverse transcriptase amino acid substitutions at sites associated with primary LMV resistance (rtM204I/V and rtA181T) in four (19%) women. These viral variants were detected mostly at low frequencies (0.63-5.92%) at EOT, but one LMV-treated mother had an rtA181T variant that increased from 2.2% pretherapy to 25.59% at EOT. This mother was also infected with the vaccine escape variant (sG145R), which was inhibited by LMV treatment. LMV therapy during late pregnancy only reduced maternal viraemia moderately, and drug-resistant viral variants emerged."

CD011926,0,23715799,0,Diversity of the vaginal microbiome correlates with preterm birth.,"Reproductive tract infection is a major initiator of preterm birth (PTB). The objective of this prospective cohort study of 88 participants was to determine whether PTB correlates with the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy. Total DNA was purified from posterior vaginal fornix swabs during gestation. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction primers, followed by chain-termination sequencing. Bacteria were identified by comparing contig consensus sequences with the Ribosomal Database Project. Dichotomous responses were summarized via proportions and continuous variables via means ± standard deviation. Mean Shannon Diversity index differed by Welch t test (P = .00016) between caucasians with PTB and term gestation. Species diversity was greatest among African Americans (P = .0045). Change in microbiome/Lactobacillus content and presence of putative novel/noxious bacteria did not correlate with PTB. We conclude that uncultured vaginal bacteria play an important role in PTB and race/ethnicity and sampling location are important determinants of the vaginal microbiome."
CD011926,0,26101355,0,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Neonatal HSV Infection on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy.,"Optimal acyclovir dosing under continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in neonates is unknown. We monitored serum acyclovir levels and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) DNA levels in a neonate with disseminated HSV-1 infection and renal failure undergoing CRRT. A full-term, 5-day-old female presented with a 2-day history of lethargy and fever. She developed fulminant hepatitis and was diagnosed with HSV-1 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Acyclovir was initiated at 60 mg/kg/day, which was lowered to 20 mg/kg/day because of development of renal failure. She was placed on continuous hemodialysis. Acyclovir dosing was adjusted according to serum acyclovir levels, and HSV-1 viral load was sequentially monitored. Semiquantification of serum HSV-1 levels was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Acyclovir levels were measured by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Acyclovir was administered at 20 mg/kg intravenously over 1 hour; peak concentration was 18.9 μg/mL. The half-life of acyclovir was estimated to be 2 to 3 h. Viral load remained high during dosing every 24 hours, with a decline of 0.17 log copies/24 hours. Acyclovir dosing was changed to 20 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours, with an average viral load decline of 0.44 log copies/24 hours. Despite the guideline recommendation of 24-hour redosing, acyclovir was dialyzed at a rate that resulted in suboptimal treatment. Individual therapeutic drug monitoring for acyclovir and dosing adjustment may be required to optimize therapy for patients undergoing CRRT."

CD011926,0,21307224,0,Serological evidence of vertical transmission of JC and BK polyomaviruses in humans.,"Vertical transmission of JC virus and BK virus has been investigated by few authors, with conflicting results. We performed a combined serological and genomic study of 19 unselected pregnant women and their newborns. Blood and urine samples were collected during each gestational trimester from the pregnant women. Umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, urine and nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from newborns at delivery and after 1 week and 1 month of life. Polyomavirus DNA was detected by nested PCR. Polyomavirus IgG-, IgM- and IgA-specific antibodies were measured in maternal and newborn serum samples using a virus-like-particle-based ELISA method. BKV and JCV DNA were detected in urine from 4 (21 %) and 5 (26 %) women, respectively. BKV and JCV seroprevalences in the pregnant women were 84 % and 42 %, respectively. Using a rise in the IgG level or the transient appearance of an IgA or IgM response as evidence of infection in the newborn, we detected BKV and JCV infections in four (21 %) and three (16 %) newborns, respectively. Three infants had serological evidence of infection with both BKV and JCV. In two of the four possible BKV-infected newborns, the mothers seroconverted during pregnancy, while another mother was viruric and IgA seropositive. The mother of one of the three possible JCV-infected newborns was viruric and IgA seropositive; another mother was viruric. These results suggest JC virus and BK virus can be transmitted from mother to newborn during pregnancy or soon after birth."

Selection of primers that can accurately type the circulating genotypes is crucial in the context of vaccine introduction and correctly interpreting the impact of vaccination on strain distribution. To our knowledge this study is the first report from Asia of misidentification of genotype G9 as G3 due to a primer-template mismatch. We tested two published G-genotype specific primers sets, designed by Gouvea and colleagues (Set A) and Iturriza-Gomara and colleagues (Set B) on RVA from Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. Among 52 rotaviruses typed as G3 by set A primers, 36 (69.2%) were identified as G9 by nucleotide sequencing and set B primers. Moreover, of 300 rotaviruses tested, 28.3% were untypable by set A primers whereas only 12.3% were untypable by set B primers. Our findings reinforce the need to periodically monitor the primers used for RVA genotyping."

However, few studies have been conducted on the infection of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) associated with pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected between July 2008 and June 2010 from 1,028 children, aged ≤16.5 years, who were diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia in Beijing, China. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to screen the samples for hMPV and common respiratory viruses. hMPV was detected in 6.3% of the patients with community-acquired pneumonia. This detection rate is the third highest for a respiratory virus in children with community-acquired pneumonia, after that of rhinovirus (30.9%) and respiratory syncytial virus (30.7%). The detection rate of hMPV in 2008/2009 (42/540, 7.8%) was significantly higher than in 2009/2010 (23/488, 4.7%; χ(2)  = 4.065, P = 0.044). The hMPV subtypes A2, B1, and B2 were found to co-circulate, with A2 being most prevalent. These results indicate that hMPV plays a substantial role in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in China. Overall, these findings provide a better understanding of the epidemiological and clinical features of hMPV infections."

However, data on the pathogenic characteristics of the organism isolated in rural communities in South Africa are lacking. In this study, the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. from diarrhoeal stools, haemolytic and haemagglutinating activities of the isolates, and antibiotic susceptibility profiles, including minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) patterns to different antibiotics, were determined using the standard microbiological techniques. Campylobacter spp. were isolated from individuals of all age-groups; however, the infection rate was higher among individuals aged less than two years (30.4%). Of 115 Campylobacter strains isolated, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis indicated that 98 (85%) were C. jejuni, while 17 (15%) were C. coli. Seventy-one (62%) of the strains showed haemolysis on human blood, and 80% agglutinated human blood, whereas 22.6% were beta-lactamase-positive. Resistance to antimicrobials, such as erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and fusidic acid, was high.

Haemolytic and haemagglutinating activities may be useful in preliminary characterization of pathogenic strains in settings where Campylobacter-associated infections are common."
CD011926,0,22459558,0,Evaluation of multiplex polymerase chain reaction and microarray-based assay for rapid herpesvirus diagnostics.,"Rapid diagnosis is critical to minimize morbidity and mortality associated with infections of the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we evaluated the performance of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray-based method, Prove-it™ Herpes, in a routine clinical laboratory setting for the diagnostics of 7 herpesviruses in viral CNS infections. Cerebrospinal fluid samples (n = 495), which had arrived for diagnostics in the 5 participating laboratories, were analyzed for herpesvirus DNA both by the current PCR-based method of the laboratory and by the microarray assay. The sensitivity and specificity for the microarray assay were 93% and 99%, respectively. The microarray assay was considered as a rapid and robust diagnostic platform that was easily implemented into the laboratory workflow. The broad herpesvirus coverage and the small sample volume required by the assay could benefit the diagnostics and thus the treatment of life-threatening infections of the CNS, especially among immunocompromised patients."

CD011926,0,17541638,0,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants admitted to paediatric intensive care units in London, and in their families.","We carried out a study in five London paediatric intensive care units (PICUs), with the objectives of describing a cohort of infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, comparing hospital diagnosis with PCR results and investigating the spread of RSV in families. Eligible infants were under 5 months old and admitted betweem November 1998 and October 1999 with respiratory failure, apnoea and/or bradycardia or acute life threatening episodes (ALTE). We diagnosed RSV by PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal aspirate, and in contacts by PCR of pernasal swabs. Of the 137 eligible infants, 66% (91/137) were recruited; of these, 82% (75/91) had RSV, with 47% (35/75) diagnosed by hospital laboratory tests and 93% (70/75) by PCR. The median duration of ventilation was 4.4 days, the length of stay on PICU, 8.6 days, and the length of stay in hospital, 15.9 days. In most families (62%), the parents and siblings developed symptoms of RSV infection at the same time as the infant. When the index infant was a secondary case, primary cases occurred in both older siblings (16 families) and adults (11 families). Silent RSV infection occurred frequently amongst children and adults. RSV is under-diagnosed in PICUs. PCR increases the rate of diagnosis of RSV compared to routine hospital diagnostic methods. Young infants are most often infected at the same time as or before their parents and siblings, indicating that the source may be outside the household; vaccinating family members may not prevent RSV infection in infants."
CD011926,0,12803739,0,HIV transmission through breastfeeding: problems and prevention.,"The greatest burden of HIV infection in women and their children is disproportionately borne by the poorest countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Breastfeeding is a major health-promoting factor for infants and children in developing countries but the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV by this route is challenging traditional practices and health policies in low-resource countries. Maternal and infant factors contributing to the risk of MTCT through breastfeeding are still poorly understood and not well researched. Factors identified include: advanced clinical stages of infection in the mother; high maternal plasma HIV-1 load; presence of mastitis; and infant oral thrush. In many developing countries, international agencies are providing support and recommendations for preventing MTCT of HIV-1 by breastfeeding. Preventive strategies supported by WHO/UNICEF and charitable agencies in some sentinel centres in sub-Saharan Africa include routine antenatal voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), PCR testing of infants of seropositive mothers at 6 weeks of age, various combinations of a shortened period (3-6 mths) of exclusive breastfeeding, perinatal administration of antiretrovirals (ARV) such as nevirapine and provision of affordable and safe infant replacement feeds (presently given free by UNICEF in some centres). Many problems, however, have hindered effective implementation of these interventions. In many poor communities, even where VCT facilities are available, acceptance of HIV testing is low because there is fear of stigmatisation by the spouse, family or community and compliance with complex drug regimens is therefore poor. Other problems include the exorbitant cost of antiretroviral drugs, inadequately resourced health care systems and unavailability or poor acceptance of safe breast-milk alternatives. The rate of mixed feeding is high and so the risk of MTCT is increased. Continued promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months, irrespective of HIV status, followed by a properly prepared, high energy, nutritious complementary diet, with the possibility of early weaning to an animal milk formula, still appears to be the most appropriate option for the poor in countries with high levels of MTCT not deriving any benefit from the above strategies. While a longer period of breastfeeding would probably increase the risk of MTCT in vulnerable communities, a shorter duration would certainly increase infant morbidity and mortality. Results of investigations of the efficacy of ARV for protecting the infants of HIV-infected mothers during the breastfeeding period are awaited."
CD011926,0,19644129,0,"Rapid, point-of-care extraction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 proviral DNA from whole blood for detection by real-time PCR.","PCR detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA is the method recommended for use for the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants in limited-resource settings. Currently, testing must be performed in central laboratories, which are usually located some distance from health care facilities. While the collection and transportation of samples, such as dried blood spots, has improved test accessibility, the results are often not returned for several weeks. To enable PCR to be performed at the point of care while the mothers wait, we have developed a vertical filtration method that uses a separation membrane and an absorbent pad to extract cellular DNA from whole blood in less than 2 min. Cells are trapped in the separation membrane as the specimen is collected, and then a lysis buffer is added. The membrane retains the DNA, while the buffer washes away PCR inhibitors, which get wicked into the absorbent blotter pad. The membrane containing the entrapped DNA is then added to the PCR mixture without further purification. The method demonstrates a high degree of reproducibility and analytical sensitivity and allows the quantification of as few as 20 copies of HIV-1 proviral DNA from 100 microl of blood. In a blinded study with 182 longitudinal samples from infants (ages, 0 to 72 weeks) obtained from the Women and Infants Transmission Study, our assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 100%."

Of 984 stool specimens collected between 17 April 2004 and 16 April 2005, rotavirus was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 187 (19%) diarrheal children less than 5 years of age. Of these, 160 (86%) were classified into G and P genotypes as follows: G1P[8] (44%), G2P[4] (20%), G9P[8] (11%), G12P[8] (4%), and G3P[8] (4%). RNA polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified 94 (50%) specimens as long RNA patterns, 30 (16%) specimens as short RNA patterns, and 1 mixed infection. Only a single long RNA electropherotype was identified for seven specimens containing G12P[8] rotavirus. RNA-RNA hybridization demonstrated that the G12P[8] strains were similar in their genomic constellation to locally cocirculating strains and to a Nepalese G12P[8] strain. The Saudi Arabian G12 VP7 gene had a 99% nucleotide sequence identity with Nepalese and Indian G12 VP7 genes and belonged to the third lineage.

The affected individuals in our report were diagnosed with postnatal microcephaly, early-onset epilepsy, severe vision impairment, and pulmonary symptoms including bronchiectasis and recurrent respiratory infections. A heterozygous DIAPH1 mutation was originally reported in one family with autosomal dominant deafness. Recently, however, a homozygous nonsense DIAPH1 mutation (c.2332C4T; p.Q778X) was reported in five siblings in a single family affected by microcephaly, blindness, early onset seizures, developmental delay, and bronchiectasis. The role of DIAPH1 was supported using parametric linkage analysis, RNA and protein studies in their patients' cell lines and further studies in human neural progenitors cells and a diap1 knockout mouse. In this report, the proband was initially brought to medical attention for profound metopic synostosis. Additional concerns arose when his head circumference did not increase after surgical release at 5 months of age and he was diagnosed with microcephaly and epilepsy at 6 months of age. Clinical exome analysis identified a homozygous DIAPH1 mutation. Another homozygous DIAPH1 mutation was identified in the research exome analysis of a second family with three siblings presenting with a similar phenotype. Importantly, no hearing impairment is reported in the homozygous affected individuals or in the heterozygous carrier parents in any of the families demonstrating the autosomal recessive microcephaly phenotype.

Because of submicroscopic bacteremia, microscopy can be insensitive between febrile bouts. We designed a multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to distinguish RF Borrelia from Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. The assay specifically (100%) amplified pathogenic RF Borrelia (1 copy/reaction). We then tested blood from participants within a Tanzanian cohort assessed at scheduled intervals and with fever. Among 8,617 blood samples from 2,057 participants surveyed routinely, 7 (0.08%) samples and 7 (0.3%) participants had RF DNA (median, 4.4 × 10(3) copies/ml). Of 382 samples from 310 febrile persons, 15 (3.9%) samples from 13 (4.2%) participants had RF DNA (median, 7.9 × 10(2) copies/ml). Five (1.3%) samples from 4 (1.3%) participants were found to harbor Borrelia by microscopy. We conclude that multiplex qPCR holds promise for improved clinical diagnosis and epidemiologic assessment of RF."

The HCW experienced onset of diarrhea and malaise (nonrespiratory symptoms atypical of the catarrhal phase of pertussis) on August 26. By September 2, paroxysms of coughing led the HCW to consult a colleague, who ordered the PCR test, prescribed a 5-day course of azithromycin, and advised avoidance of patient care until treatment completion. Contrary to the hospital's infection control policy, neither the HCW nor the colleague reported the presumptive diagnosis of pertussis to the hospital's public health department. The HCW continued to work in the outpatient department until the positive PCR result was received on September 5, at which time the hospital's public health department was first notified.

This prospective study was done on 303 admitted children of malaria. The diagnosis was done by peripheral blood smear and rapid diagnostic test. Further confirmation of severe P. vivax monoinfection was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The proportion of P. falciparum, P. vivax, and mixed (P. falciparum and P. vivax) infection was 61.01%, 33.99%, and 4.95%, respectively. Severe disease was present in 49.5% (150/303) children with malaria, with the risk greatest among P. vivax monoinfection (63.1% [65/103]) compared with P. falciparum, either alone (42.7% [79/185]; odds ratio [OR] = 2.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40-3.76], P = 0.001) or mixed infections (40% [6/15]; OR = 2.57 [95% CI = 0.88-7.48]). In children < 5 years of age, the proportion of severe malaria attributable to P. vivax rose to 67.4% (31/46) compared with 30.4% (14/46) of P. falciparum (OR = 4.7 [95% CI = 2.6-8.6], P < 0.0001) and 2.2% (1/46) of mixed infection (OR = 92 [95% CI = 24.6-339.9], P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients having severe manifestations, which included severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, abnormal bleeding was significantly high in association with P. vivax monoinfection in 0-5 year age group, while the same was significantly high in association with P. falciparum monoinfection in 5-10 year age group. Similarly P. vivax monoinfection had greatest propensity to cause multiorgan dysfunction in 0-5 year age group (34.1% [17/41], P < 0.0001) in comparison to P. falciparum monoinfection, which had similar propensity in 5-10 year age group (36.8% [35/95], P = 0.039). Plasmodium vivax monoinfection was almost equally serious to cause significant mortality in comparison to P. falciparum (case fatality rate of severe P. vivax was 3.9% versus 3.2% of severe P. falciparum malaria; P = 1.0). This study reaffirms the evidence of severe P. vivax malaria in children in Bikaner."
CD011926,0,18689231,0,Does vertical transmission contribute to the prevalence of toxoplasmosis?,"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite with a widespread distribution both in terms of geographical and host range. Although the definitive host is the cat, it is also a major health hazard to domestic animals and humans. Three routes of transmission are recognised (infection from the cat, carnivory and congenital transmission). We aimed to assess the relative importance of congenital transmission, using sheep as a model system, due to the lack of carnivory. We report, using PCR as a diagnostic tool, that congenital transmission occurs with high frequency (69%). If transmission from oocysts was important in sheep, we would expect sheep reared under the same environmental conditions (i.e. a single farm) to have a random distribution of Toxoplasma infection. Using breeding records in conjunction with PCR, some families were found to have high Toxoplasma prevalence and abortion while others were free of Toxoplasma infection and abortion (P < 0.01). This supports the notion that Toxoplasma may be transmitted vertically. In humans, we conducted a similar study and showed that Toxoplasma was transmitted from mother to baby in 19.8% of cases. Vertical transmission in Toxoplasma may be more important than previously thought and this knowledge should be considered in any eradication strategies."

The maternofetal transmission rate in Crete was assessed and a map showing seroprevalence of pregnant women in all prefectures of Greece was prepared. The high seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in Greece (up to 46% in some areas) may be explained by: (a) the presence of a great number of stray cats; (b) the Greek diet consisting of large amounts of raw, wild vegetables and salads that could easily be contaminated with oocysts; (c) the high consumption of meat, smoked pork and sausages, well-documented sources of T. gondii infection. T. gondii genotypes were characterized, directly from clinical samples, after PCR-RFLP on the SAG2 gene and sequence analysis at the restriction sites. They belonged to all 3 clonal lineages."

A total of 840 blood samples from pregnant women, obtained at the Maternity Ward of the Hospital de Clínicas, National University of Asunción (Asunción, Paraguay), and 1,022 samples from the Regional Hospital of the San Pedro Department of Paraguay were examined. It was observed that 7.7% and 10.5%, respectively, of the pregnant women were serologically positive for infection with T. cruzi. When blood samples obtained from newborns on the day of birth or, at the most, on the first few days afterwards were examined by direct microscopic observation, an incidence of congenital transmission of 3% was found. These results are consistent with those of neighboring countries. When a serologic follow-up was conducted on the newborns until six months of age, the incidence of congenital transmission reached 10%. The same incidence rate was obtained when the samples collected during the first days after birth were examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fifty-eight infants born to seropositive mothers were followed-up, two of which were positive by direct microscopic observation at birth, and four who were PCR-positive, but microscopy-negative at birth. None of the infants were positive for IgM at birth. The infected babies were treated with benznidazole and were followed-up by serology and PCR for four years. We conclude that the PCR has a clear advantage over conventional techniques for the early detection of congenital transmission of T. cruzi infection, and for monitoring infants undergoing chemotherapy."

Although earlier studies used cultures alone to assess these interactions, the addition of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) provides further insight into these interactions. We compared results of culture and qPCR for the detection of these 3 bacteria in 446 nasopharynx samples collected from 360 healthy young children in a prospective cohort study in the Peruvian Andes. Patterns of concurrent bacterial colonization were studied using repeated measures logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess correlations among bacterial densities. At a bacterial density <10 colony forming units/mL measured by qPCR, culture detected significantly less carriers (P < 0.0001) for all 3 pathogens, than at a bacterial density >10 colony forming units/mL. In addition, there was a positive association between S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae colonization measured by both culture (odds ratio [OR] 3.11-3.17, P < 0.001) and qPCR (OR 1.95-1.97, P < 0.01). The densities of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, measured by qPCR, were positively correlated (correlation coefficient 0.32, P < 0.001). A negative association was found between the presence of S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in carriage with both culture (OR 0.45, P = 0.024) and qPCR (OR 0.61, P < 0.05). The impact of density on detection by culture and the observed density-related interactions support use of qPCR in additional studies to examine vaccine effects on diverse bacterial species."

The AccuProbe culture identification kits for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), M. avium complex (MAC) and M. avium were used to identify the isolates. Spoligotyping, IS901 PCR and IS1311 and IS1245 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to characterize the isolates. Of the 43 biopsies, ten M. avium, seven M. tuberculosis, three M. bovis, and two M. intracellulare were isolated. Two isolates could not be identified with AccuProbe and from 19 samples no mycobacteria could be isolated. Three isolates with the Beijing spoligotype were identified from the seven M. tuberculosis isolates. The spoligopatterns of the M. bovis isolates had previously been detected in cattle in Uganda. Isolation of members of the MAC group reflects the complex interaction between the transhumant communities, water sources and their cattle. None of the M. avium isolates harboured IS901, and all showed several bands on IS1311 and IS1245 RFLP, in accordance with M. avium subsp. hominissuis. Composite dendrograms of IS1311 and IS1245 RFLP showed that the isolates were similar and identical patterns were found. The isolation of M. bovis confirms the human infection with zoonotic mycobacteria in areas where consumption of raw milk and meat is routine.

We tested the efficacy of this detection protocol in this study. We analyzed 2,309 newborns at 22 weeks or more of gestation from January 1992 to December 2000. Clinical manifestations of the mother, fetus, and newborn were used in the initial step to identify the high-risk group. For the high-risk group, if the causes of clinical manifestation remained unclear, we assayed for CMV DNA in the amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, or newborn urine using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a second step. Positive PCR results were confirmed by isolating CMV. The initial step detected 287 high-risk cases from 2,309 deliveries. In this group, 100 cases did not have reasonable explanations for the clinical manifestation. In the second-step PCR, intrauterine CMV infection was diagnosed in 10 of 100 cases (10%). The initial clinical classification reduced the proportion of cases needing laboratory investigation to 4%. Thus, our strategy detected intrauterine CMV infection in as many as 10% of high-risk patients after the first step, which is much higher than the general screening rate."

Nasopharyngeal aspirates of hospitalized children 0-16 years of age with an acute respiratory tract infection were tested by a nine-valent multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Of 1281 children, 449 (35%) had an acute respiratory tract infection caused by at least one of the organisms studied; there were 29 cases of dual infection. At least 34-42% of severe acute respiratory tract infections in children under 5 years of age were caused by viruses. In children over 5 years of age, this proportion was 23% (P<0.001). Infection during the first 2 years of life was most frequently due to respiratory syncytial virus (n = 162 cases). Parainfluenza virus type 3 (n = 22) and type 1 (n = 14) were detected almost exclusively in children under 5 years of age. Influenza A (n = 90) and adenoviruses (n = 98) were prevalent in all age groups. The frequency of influenza B virus isolation (n = 17) rose significantly after the age of 5 years. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (n = 24 cases, 5.2%) was most frequent in 5- to 16-year-old patients. Only one case of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection was found. Since the distribution of pathogens within the different types of lower respiratory tract infections is very similar, it seems that host factors determine which form of lower respiratory tract infection develops in an individual patient. The multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction may, in the future, become an important tool for epidemiological studies as well as for individual diagnosis."

This report describes the genotypes of rotavirus strains responsible for the hospitalisation of children with acute gastroenteritis during the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010, the 3rd year of surveillance following introduction of rotavirus vaccines into the National Immunisation Program. Seven hundred and seventy-eight faecal samples were referred to the centre for G and P genotype analysis using hemi-nested multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Of the 422 confirmed as rotavirus positive, genotype G1P[8] was the dominant type nationally, representing 49.3%, followed by genotype G2P[4] (21.1%). Genotypes G3P[8], G4P[8] and G9P[8] each represented less than 3% of circulating strains nationally. The dominance of G1P[8] was in part associated with a large outbreak of severe gastroenteritis in the Northern Territory in 2010. The identification of uncommon rotavirus genotype combinations has increased since vaccine introduction, with G1P[4], G2P[8] and G9P[4] identified during this survey. Single strains of G1P[6] and G4P[6] were identified during this study period. This survey continues to highlight the fluctuations in rotavirus genotypes, and results from this survey suggest there is limited genotype selection based on vaccine usage. However, the large G1P[8] outbreak of gastroenteritis in the Northern Territory may have resulted from vaccine pressure on wild-type strains."

CD011926,0,23656963,0,Use of V(D)J recombination excision circles to identify T- and B-cell defects and to monitor the treatment in primary and acquired immunodeficiencies.,"T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs) are circular DNA segments generated in T and B cells during their maturation in the thymus and bone marrow. These circularized DNA elements persist in the cells, are unable to replicate, and are diluted as a result of cell division, thus are considered markers of new lymphocyte output. The quantification of TRECs and KRECs, which can be reliably performed using singleplex or duplex real-time quantitative PCR, provides novel information in the management of T- and B-cell immunity-related diseases. In primary immunodeficiencies, when combined with flow cytometric analysis of T- and B-cell subpopulations, the measure of TRECs and KRECs has contributed to an improved characterization of the diseases, to the identification of patients' subgroups, and to the monitoring of stem cell transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy. For the same diseases, the TREC and KREC assays, introduced in the newborn screening program, allow early disease identification and may lead to discovery of new genetic defects. TREC and KREC levels can also been used as a surrogate marker of lymphocyte output in acquired immunodeficiencies. The low number of TRECs, which has in fact been extensively documented in untreated HIV-infected subjects, has been shown to increase following antiretroviral therapy. Differently, KREC number, which is in the normal range in these patients, has been shown to decrease following long-lasting therapy. Whether changes of KREC levels have relevance in the biology and in the clinical aspects of primary and acquired immunodeficiencies remains to be firmly established."

HRV-C was the third most frequently detected behind respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus, with 141 infection episodes detected among 1885 subjects over 13 months (7.5%). Infections predominantly targeted the very young (median age 6-12 months; 80% of infections in those <2 years), occurred throughout the year but with peak incidence in early winter months. HRV-C was detected significantly more frequently among subjects with lower (LRT) and upper respiratory tract (URT) disease than controls without respiratory symptoms; HRV-C mono-infections were the second most frequently detected virus (behind RSV) in both disease presentations (6.9% and 7.8% of all cases respectively). HRV variants were classified by VP4/VP2 sequencing into 39 genotypically defined types, increasing the current total worldwide to 60. Through sequence comparisons of the 5'untranslated region (5'UTR), the majority grouped with species A (n = 96; 68%, described as HRV-Ca), the remainder forming a phylogenetically distinct 5'UTR group (HRV-Cc). Multiple and bidirectional recombination events between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants and with HRV species A represents the most parsimonious explanation for their interspersed phylogeny relationships in the VP4/VP2-encoding region. No difference in age distribution, seasonality or disease associations was identified between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. HRV-C-infected subjects showed markedly reduced detection frequencies of RSV and other respiratory viruses, providing evidence for a major interfering effect of HRV-C on susceptibility to other respiratory virus infections. HRV-C's disease associations, its prevalence and evidence for interfering effects on other respiratory viruses mandates incorporation of rhinoviruses into future diagnostic virology screening."

CD011926,0,1327250,0,Human papillomavirus.,"In the past year, new data have been published on the molecular biology of human papillomavirus infections and their relationship to cervical neoplasia. As molecular techniques have become more sophisticated and as the molecular knowledge of human papilloma-virus infections has been pursued in greater depth, it is increasingly apparent that this human tumor DNA virus is similar to a number of other oncogenic DNA viruses that have been described and well studied. These viruses appear to act through a common pathway of producing oncogenic proteins that interfere with key signalling elements that normally control the process of cell division. With a better mechanistic knowledge, it should be possible to design new therapeutic approaches to treating human papillomavirus-associated disease that are directed toward specific cellular events such as turning off the production of E6 and E7 proteins or restoring the activity of pRB or p53. Increased attention has also been turned to immunologic aspects of HPV infections, and a number of groups are eagerly pursuing the possibility of using simple office-based procedures to detect specific proteins encoded for by the human papillomavirus open reading frames in an attempt to determine who has been infected, is actively infected, and has proteins being produced that are indicative of neoplasia. From the clinical point of view, the use of outpatient excisional techniques such as the loop electrosurgical excision procedure is rapidly supplanting ablative techniques because of their superior ability to identify early invasive carcinomas and adenocarcinomas in situ that have not been detected by colposcopy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency of viable Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp) and C. trachomatis (Ct) in the respiratory tracts of paediatric patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples obtained from 182 children undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical reasons were assayed using PCR analysis, in vitro tissue culture and immunofluorescence staining for the presence of Cp and Ct. Chlamydia-specific DNA was detected by PCR in 124 (68%) out of 182 patients; 79 were positive for Cp, 77 positive for Ct and 32 for both organisms; 75 patients had cultivable Chlamydia. Ct DNA prevalence decreased, whereas Cp positivity generally increased with age. A total of 59 out of 128 asthma patients and 16 out of 54 nonasthmatics were Chlamydia culture positive. When the patients were divided into inflammatory versus noninflammatory airway disease, there were 69 (46%) out of 150 and six (18%) out of 32 BALF samples with cultivable Chlamydia, respectively. Viable Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis occur frequently in children with chronic respiratory diseases and may be more prevalent in asthma patients.

We evaluated the hypothesis that the ica operon and biofilm production are associated with CoNS disease in this setting. CoNS associated with bacteremia or blood culture contamination and from the skin of infants with CoNS bacteremia or healthy controls were obtained during a prospective case-control study on a busy NICU. A total of 180 strains were identified, of which 122 (68%) were Staphylococcus epidermidis and the remainder were S. capitis (n = 29), S. haemolyticus (n = 11), S. hominis (n = 9), S. warneri (n = 8), and S. auricularis (n = 1). The presence of the genes icaA, icaB, icaC, and icaD was determined by PCR, and biofilm production was examined using qualitative (Congo red agar [CRA]) and quantitative (microtiter plate) techniques. There were no significant differences in the presence of the ica operon or CRA positivity among the four groups of strains. However, quantitative biofilm production was significantly greater in strains isolated from either the blood or the skin of neonates with S. epidermidis bacteremia. We conclude that the quantity of biofilm produced may be associated with the ability to cause CoNS infection. This conclusion suggests that the regulation of biofilm expression may play a central role in the disease process."

CD011926,0,11160723,0,"Perinatal transmission of major, minor, and multiple maternal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 variants in utero and intrapartum.","Previous studies have provided conflicting data on the presence of selective pressures in the transmission of a homogeneous maternal viral subpopulation to the infant. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to definitively characterize the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) quasispecies transmitted in utero and intrapartum. HIV-1 envelope gene diversity from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma was measured during gestation and at delivery in mothers who did and did not transmit HIV perinatally by using a DNA heteroduplex mobility assay. Children were defined as infected in utero or intrapartum based on the timing of the first detection of HIV. Untreated transmitting mothers (n = 19) had significantly lower HIV-1 quasispecies diversity at delivery than untreated nontransmittting mothers (n = 18) (median Shannon entropy, 0.711 [0.642 to 0.816] versus 0.853 [0.762 to 0.925], P = 0.005). Eight mothers transmitted a single major env variant to their infants in utero, and one mother transmitted a single major env variant intrapartum. Four mothers transmitted multiple HIV-1 env variants to their infants in utero, and two mothers transmitted multiple env variants intrapartum. The remaining six intrapartum- and two in utero-infected infants had a homogeneous HIV-1 env quasispecies which did not comigrate with their mothers' bands at their first positive time point. In conclusion, in utero transmitters were more likely to transmit single or multiple major maternal viral variants. In contrast, intrapartum transmitters were more likely to transmit minor HIV-1 variants. These data indicate that different selective pressures, depending on the timing of transmission, may be involved in determining the pattern of maternal HIV-1 variant transmission."

Upon enrollment, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for the real-time PCR detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B, influenza virus types A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus types 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, bocavirus, enterovirus, and paraechovirus; nasopharyngeal aspirates were also obtained to detect atypical bacteria. At least one infectious agent was identified in 76 children (89.4%). RSV was the most frequently detected pathogen and its prevalence was significantly higher than that of the other pathogens in both age groups, and significantly higher in the children aged 3-12 months than in those aged <3 months. Only the children with RSV infection experienced recurrent wheezing. Viral load was significantly higher in children with than in those without recurrent wheezing. This study shows that RSV is the main reason for hospitalization during the first wheezing episode in infants, and that it appears to be the only pathogen associated with a high frequency of recurrences. A high viral load seems to be strictly related to the likelihood of recurrence."

However, the contribution of SPATEs to the virulence of neonatal septicemic Escherichia coli (NSEC) has not yet been elucidated. This study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence and phylogenetic distribution of different subtypes of SPATEs among NSEC. The presence of virulence factors and subtypes of SPATEs among different E. coli isolates was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). E. coli phylogrouping was done by triplex PCR. Clonality of the isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The presence of SPATEs was significantly higher among the septicemic isolates (89 %) than the fecal (7.5 %) and environmental isolates (2.5 %). Vat (vacuolating autotransporter toxin) and Sat (secreted autotransporter toxin) were found to be the two most predominant SPATEs. The incidence of SPATEs was high in septicemic isolates of phylogroups A and B1 (87 %), lacking other virulence factors. The high prevalence of SPATEs in the non-B2 phylogroups of septicemic isolates in comparison with fecal and environmental isolates indicates an association of SPATEs with NSEC. The NSEC isolates were found to be clonally distinct, suggesting that the high prevalence of SPATEs was not due to clonal relatedness of the isolates. This study is the first to show the association of SPATEs with NSEC. The presence of SPATEs in the septicemic/NSEC isolates may be considered as the most discriminatory trait studied here."

The goal of this study was to evaluate frequency, susceptibility to antifungals, and genetic polymorphism of Candida species isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. The Candida isolates included in this study were obtained from blood cultures, abdominal fluids, and central venous catheters (CVC) of hospitalized patients at the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Uberlândia during the period of July 2010 - June 2011. Susceptibility tests were conducted by the broth microdilution method. The RAPD-PCR tests used employed initiator oligonucleotides OPA09, OPB11, and OPE06. Of the 63 Candida isolates, 18 (28.5%) were C. albicans, 20 (31.7%) were C. parapsilosis complex species, 14 (22.2%) C. tropicalis, four (6.4%) C. glabrata, four (6.4%) C. krusei, two (3.3%) C. kefyr, and one (1.6%) C. lusitaniae. In vitro resistance to amphotericin B was observed in 12.7% of isolates. In vitro resistance to azoles was not detected, except for C. krusei. The two primers, OPA09 and OPB11, were able to distinguish different species. Isolates of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis complex species presented six and five clusters, respectively, with the OPA09 marker by RAPD-PCR, showing the genetic variability of the isolates of those species. It was concluded that members of the C. parapsilosis complex were the most frequent species found, and most isolates were susceptible to the antifungals amphotericin B, flucozanole, and itraconazole. High genetic polymorphisms were observed for isolates of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis complex species, mainly with the OPA09 marker."

In this research, we detected active coinfected patients by HCV residing in the endemic city of Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico, with positive diagnosis to dengue during the acute phase. We performed a retrospective analysis of 240 serum samples from dengue patients. The IgM-ELISA serological test was used for dengue diagnosis, as well as viral isolation to confirm infection. DENV and HCV were detected by RT-PCR. Thus, 31 (12.9%) samples showed DENV-HCV coinfection, but interestingly the highest frequency of coinfection cases was found in male patients presenting hemorrhagic dengue in 19/31 (61.29%), with a predominance of 12 : 7 in males. Firstly, coinfection of DENV-HCV in Mérida, Mexico, was detected in young dengue patients, between 11 and 20 years old (38.7%), followed by those between 21 and 30 years old (32%); only 16.13% were between 0 and 10 years of age.

HCMV strains display genetic variability in different regions. Distribution of HCMV genotypes in the population of congenitally infected newborns from Central Poland and viral load in newborns' blood is described and discussed. HCMV isolates were analysed by sequencing at three sites on the genome: the UL144 tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)-like receptor gene, the US28 beta-chemokine receptor gene and the UL55 envelope glycoprotein B (gB) gene. The newborns' blood was examined for HCMV DNA with a nested (UL144, UL55) or heminested (US28) polymerase chain reaction, and the genotypes were determined by sequence analysis. HCMV DNA was detectable in 25 out of 55 examined newborns born by HCMV-infected mothers (45.5%). The blood viral load in mother-infant pairs was determined. Most of the newborns had identical virus genotype, gB2 (96%), UL144 B1 (88%) and US28 A2 (84%). These genotypes were detected in all newborns with asymptomatic congenital infection. The occurrence of UL144 B1 or US28 A2 genotypes in the babies examined was significant in comparison to other genotypes (p=0.0002 and p=0.040 respectively). There was no association between specific gB subtypes in all patients groups (p=0.463). There was no correlation between HCMV genotypes and the outcome."

Four cases of neonatal enteroviral disease were treated in our hospital nursery in July and August 2011; 3 were presumed or proven vertical transmission cases and 1 was a presumed horizontal transmission. We aimed to prevent development of severe illness in contacts of affected neonates following a ministry of health advisory during the summer of 2011 warning of increased neonatal enteroviral morbidity and mortality in Israel. Strict infection control measures were implemented, including meticulous decontamination of the nursery environment and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin prophylaxis to contacts. No further horizontal transmission occurred after infection control interventions. Immunoglobulin prophylaxis to control enteroviral infection in the nursery should be considered as an auxiliary infection control intervention during a nursery outbreak."

They have traditionally been thought of as mild illnesses that are caused by rare and, in case of P. ovale, short-lived parasites. However, recent advances in sensitive PCR diagnosis are causing a re-evaluation of this assumption. Low-level infection seems to be common across malaria-endemic areas, often as complex mixed infections. The potential interactions of P. malariae and P. ovale with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax might explain some basic questions of malaria epidemiology, and understanding these interactions could have an important influence on the deployment of interventions such as malaria vaccines."

In Austria serological screening for detection of newly acquired infection during pregnancy was introduced in 1975. In this study we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of fetal infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Amniotic fluid samples were analyzed from 11 women with serological indication of acute toxoplasmosis infection. Nine of these women had already received treatment prior to amnio-centesis and no evidence of Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected with PCR in the respective amniotic fluid samples. Isolation of the organism by mouse inoculation was negative in these cases and follow-up serology as well as clinical examination of the infants confirmed these results. In 2 patients investigation of the amniotic fluid samples by means of PCR was positive; both women had not yet been treated at the time of amniocentesis. Our results indicate that identification of Toxoplasma gondii in amniotic fluid is a useful procedure for diagnosing or excluding fetal infection. Moreover, the current recommendations of the screening program appear to be successful in preventing congenital toxoplasmosis."

A total of 250 frozen archived pediatric respiratory specimens previously characterized as either negative or positive for one or more viruses by real-time PCR were examined using the eSensor RVP. Overall agreement between the eSensor RVP and corresponding real-time PCR assays for shared analytes was 99.2% (kappa = 0.96 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.94 to 0.98]). The combined positive percent agreement was 95.4% (95% CI, 92.5 to 97.3); the negative percent agreement was 99.7% (95% CI, 99.4 to 99.8). The mean real-time PCR threshold cycle (C(T)) value for specimens with discordant results was 39.73 (95% CI, 38.03 to 41.43). Detection of coinfections and correct identification of influenza A virus subtypes were comparable between methods. Of note, the eSensor RVP rhinovirus assay was found to be more sensitive and specific than the corresponding rhinovirus real-time PCR. In contrast, the eSensor RVP adenovirus B, C, and E assays demonstrated some cross-reactivity when tested against known adenovirus serotypes representing groups A through F. The eSensor RVP is robust and relatively easy to perform, it involves a unique biosensor technology for target detection, and its multiplexed design allows for efficient and simultaneous interrogation of a single specimen for multiple viruses. Potential drawbacks include a slower turnaround time and the need to manipulate amplified product during the protocol, increasing the possibility of contamination."

The majority of isolates (84.5%) were identified as A. baumannii, confirming this species as the most common hospital Acinetobacter. Three very distinct A. baumannii clonal groups (A1, A2, and A3) were defined. The A1 isolates appeared to be genetically related to the well-characterized European EU II clone. A2 was responsible for three outbreaks which occurred in two intensive care units. Space/time population dynamic analysis showed that A1 and A2 were successful nosocomial clones. Most of the A. baumannnii isolates were imipenem resistant. The genetic determinants of carbapenem resistance were investigated by multiplex PCR, showing that resistance, independently of hospital origin, period of isolation, or clonal group, was associated with the presence of a bla (OXA-58-like) gene and with ISAba2 and ISAba3 elements flanking this gene. bla (OXA-58) appeared to be horizontally transferred. This study showed that the high discriminatory power of AFLP is useful for identification and typing of nosocomial Acinetobacter isolates. Moreover the use of AFLP in a real-time surveillance program allowed us the recognition of clinically relevant and widespread clones and their monitoring in hospital settings. The correlation between clone diffusion, imipenem resistance, and the presence of the bla(OXA-58-like) gene is discussed."

Children with early symptoms will come into quick contact with a hospital, while others may be infected for up to ten years without presenting HIV-related symptoms. HIV infection can be diagnosed early with a combination of methods that are currently available (viral culture, ELISA antigen testing), and also with methods that are at present only used in research (DNA and RNA detection with PCR). Together with the clinical picture, it should be possible to have a reliable diagnosis no later than six months after birth. The general development of the children can be followed at frequent out-patient visits, while prophylactic measures can quickly be put into motion when necessary. The course of the illness can be followed and predicted with the help of different laboratory investigations. The medical treatment of HIV positive children follows the pattern of adult HIV positive patients. Children with an increased risk of bacterial infections can receive intravenous immune globulin as prophylaxis. HIV infected children can be given the common vaccinations, but BCG and oral anti-polio vaccine should not be given to children with symptomatic HIV infection. Prophylaxis of vertical transmission of HIV should be aimed at HIV testing of all pregnant women, to prevent this route of transmission.

CD011926,0,15599464,0,Genetic detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli isolated from children with sporadic diarrhea.,"Escherichia coli strains are among the major bacterial causes of diarrheal illness. At least 5 categories of diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) are recognized, namely enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Due to the need for costly and labor-intensive diagnostic procedures, identification of DEC is difficult at standard laboratories. Therefore, the epidemiology of DEC infections remains obscure in Taiwan. Recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dot blot has been used for genetic detection of DEC. In this study, we analyzed 150 E. coli isolates from diarrheal stools of children under 5 years old. The PCR tests detected 5 ETEC (3.3%), 6 EPEC (4%), 4 EIEC (2.7%), and 13 EAEC (8.7%) isolates. No EHEC was detected. Dot blot and sequence analysis were used to confirm the results of PCR. The cellular fatty acid (CFA) profiles from E. coli isolates were also analyzed. Comparison of CFA composition revealed minor variation in the percentage of each fatty acid detected among DEC isolates of ETEC, EPEC, EIEC and EAEC, but did not provide enough evidence for differentiating between categories of DEC by CFA profiles alone."

In Austria, a nationwide serological healthcare program to identify potential maternal toxoplasma infections during pregnancy exists. We assessed the clinical use of amniocentesis for toxoplasma-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on amniotic fluid to detect CT. Data on serology, amniocentesis, PCR, complications, treatment, and paediatric clinical outcome were collected retrospectively among the birth cohort 1992-2008. There were 1386 women with amniocentesis, but only in 707 cases (51%) was acute maternal infection confirmed serologically. A high proportion (49%) of amniocenteses with negative PCR results in women with chronic infection or seronegativity were performed without clinical justification for the women or their foetuses. The positive and negative predictive values of PCR were 94.4% and 99.3%, respectively. Thirty-nine foetuses with CT, including four deaths, were reported. The five PCR-negative but infected infants were identified by the serological and clinical follow-up program. Thirty percent of amniocenteses were performed in the third trimester, and gestational age or treatment did not influence PCR sensitivity. Amniocentesis is indicated in women with acute maternal infection, and facilitated targeted therapies in pregnant women and their offspring. In women with late toxoplasma infection, negative amniotic fluid PCR made treatment of infants unnecessary. Serological and clinical follow-up of infants is important to confirm the infection status of the infant. Recommendations, based on our 17-year experience, to improve the current diagnostic strategies and to reduce unnecessary amniocentesis, are given."

Antibody against HCV was detected in the blood of all newborns immediately after birth, but dropped to low or undetectable levels by 7 months of age. HCV-RNA was detected 2 days after birth in the blood of five infants (22%) but fell to undetectable levels by 6 months. HCV-HVR1 sequence analysis performed in one mother-infant pair on the second day after birth revealed two nucleotide changes. Two months later the same sequence was detected again in the HVR1, suggesting a very low replication rate. Thus, the study showed that vertically transmitted HCV was eliminated in all newborn infants by 6 months after delivery, with concomitant disappearance of HCV antibodies. The mechanism of HCV elimination in newborns at risk remains to be elucidated."

CD011926,0,12734271,0,Rapid screening for Streptococcus agalactiae in vaginal specimens of pregnant women by fluorescent in situ hybridization.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) are the most frequent pathogens in neonates with sepsis. A rapid screening method is required to identify carriage of GBS in pregnant women at the time of delivery. In order to detect GBS in vaginal specimens, the efficiency of the standard culture versus fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was investigated. In 258 examined vaginal specimens, FISH identified 58 of the 59 GBS-positive samples (98.3%), whereas by means of standard culture only 38 specimens were positive (64.4%). We recommend FISH as a rapid, specific, highly sensitive screening technique for the detection of GBS in pregnant women at delivery."
CD011926,0,22086821,0,Neonatal herpes infection: case report and discussion.,"Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are often life-threatening. Although sometimes difficult to diagnose, most infections can be treatable when found early. Infection with HSV should be kept high on the differential diagnosis of a febrile newborn younger than 1 month old, and treatment should be strongly considered for infants with certain risk factors, even before definitive culture or polymerase chain reaction results are available. The case presented here exemplifies the benefits of maintaining a high suspicion of and empirically treating for HSV in a 10-day-old febrile infant."
CD011926,0,24799600,0,Detection of congenital cytomegalovirus infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of saliva or urine specimens.,"Viral culture of urine or saliva has been the gold standard technique for the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Results of rapid culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of urine and saliva specimens from 80 children were compared to determine the clinical utility of a real-time PCR assay for diagnosis of congenital CMV infection. Results of urine PCR were positive in 98.8% of specimens. Three PCR-positive urine samples were culture negative. Results of saliva PCR and culture were concordant in 78 specimens (97.5%). Two PCR-positive saliva samples were culture negative. These findings demonstrate that PCR performs as well as rapid culture of urine or saliva specimens for diagnosing congenital CMV infection and saliva specimens are easier to collect. Because PCR also offers more rapid turnaround, is unlikely to be affected by storage and transport conditions, has lower cost, and may be adapted to high-throughput situations, it is well suited for targeted testing and large-scale screening for CMV."
CD011926,0,9105838,0,Hepatitis C virus infection in pregnancy and the risk of mother-to-child transmission.,"The risk of vertical transmission of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) from infected mothers to their children during pregnancy and delivery was determined in 120 children born to HCV-positive mothers. Methods included enzyme immunoassay and immunoblot for detection of HCV antibodies and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of viral RNA. Six (5%) children were perinatally infected with HCV as shown by RT-PCR. None of the infected children had clinical signs of hepatitis. None of the pregnancies was complicated by abortion, stillbirth, premature birth, or malformation of the child. Special concern was given to the possibility of HCV transmission via breast milk. In no breast milk sample obtained from 34 HCV-infected mothers was HCV RNA detected. These observations indicate that HCV infection is not necessarily a contraindication for breast-feeding."

Serology (hepatitis A, B, C and E, leptospirosis, dengue, rickettsia), antigen tests (dengue), PCR assays (hepatitis A, C and E) and blood cultures (septicaemia) were performed on samples from 392 patients admitted with jaundice or raised transaminases (> or =x3) to Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Laos over 3 years. Conservative definitions suggested diagnoses of dengue (8.4%), rickettsioses (7.3%), leptospirosis (6.8%), hepatitis B (4.9%), hepatitis C (4.9%), community-acquired septicaemia (3.3%) and hepatitis E (1.6%). Although anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM antibody results suggested that 35.8% of patients had acute HAV infections, anti-HAV IgG antibody avidity and HAV PCR suggested that 82% had polyclonal activation and not acute HAV infections. Scrub typhus, murine typhus or leptospirosis were present in 12.8% of patients and were associated with meningism and relatively low AST and ALT elevation. These patients would be expected to respond to empirical doxycycline therapy which, in the absence of virological diagnosis and treatment, may be an appropriate cost-effective intervention in Lao patients with jaundice/hepatitis."

A retrospective 5-year study was performed from 2009 to 2014 in 1,194 patients under the age of 17 years (mean age of 3 years) that were diagnosed with LRTIs and from whom both NPA and BAL were obtained. Clinical and demographic data were recorded, and NPA and BAL samples were analyzed for HBoV-positivity by real-time PCR. Of the 1,194 patients enrolled, 65 (5.4%) patients had HBoV detected from NPA, and 61 (5.1%) had HBoV detected from BAL. For HBoV, there was a significant association between the NPA and BAL samples (P < 0.001), but the diagnostic validity was relatively low (kappa = 0.414). When real-time PCR-positivity for HBoV in BAL was used as a reference for diagnosis, NPA had a good specificity and better positive predictive validity in male patients or those younger than 3 years of age. NPA has a similar yield and a good specificity for diagnosis of LRTIs with HBoV compared to BAL. The best diagnostic validity for NPA was detected in male patients or those younger than 3 years old."

Valencia, Venezuela].","Genetic and antigenic rotavirus (RV) variabilities may have implications in the severity of the infection caused by these agents; however the studies are not conclusive. For that purpose, the mean severity scores of diarrhea episodes caused by RV types G1 and G3 were compared, at Ciudad Hospitalaria ""Dr. Enrique Tejera"" in Valencia, Venezuela, between 2001-2005. RV were identified by ELISA, G and P types by RT-PCR. The severity of infection was determined using the Ruuska-Vesikari system and the mean severity values were compared using the Student's t-test (two-tailed, 95% CI). RV were detected in 24.5% of patients (3193/13026), being G3 the most common (50.3%), followed by G1 (39.2%), G9 (6.2%), G2 (0.6%), G4 (0.6%) and of mixed infection 3.1% (G1 + G3). Type P[8] was present in 87.3% of samples, 10.9% P[4] and 1.8% P[6]. There were not statistically significant differences (P > or = 0.05) observed between the episodes caused by G1 and G3 when age, breast feeding, and degrees of malnutrition and dehydration were considered. Nevertheless, in the G3 positive group, fever, episodes of more than 6 days, 6 or more evacuations in 24 hours and 3 or more days with vomit, were observed. The mean severity score for the G3 episodes (11.1) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than for G1 (7.8). These results show that G3 was associated with severe diarrhea, supporting the hypothesis that the knowledge of the variability and frequency of viral types is essential to measure the impact of an anti-rotavirus vaccine."

Fimbria was the most frequent (72.7%) structure identified. Only strains hybridising with the EAEC DNA probe carried aggA, but one strain produced a similar but unrelated bundle-like structure. All probe-positive and 62.5% of the probe-negative strains carried the virulence genes tested; aspU and irp2 prevailed among the former strains. The EAEC probe-positive strains were more diverse, and some of these strains, which promoted cell detachment, also carried the hly and pap sequences, thus suggesting they might represent uropathogenic E. coli."

This led us to the present epidemiological investigation of K. ohmeri fungaemia cases. All phenotypically identified C. tropicalis blood isolates during October 2008 through to December 2009 at our advanced paediatric centre were included for molecular identification by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer and D1/D2 regions of rDNA. After identifying a large cluster K. ohmeri fungaemia cases, a case-control study was carried out retrospectively to analyse potential risk factors for K. ohmeri fungaemia. Molecular typing of the isolates was performed using a fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) technique. The antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as per the M27-A3 protocol of CLSI. Thirty-eight (25.7%) of 148 phenotypically identified C. tropicalis isolates were confirmed as K. ohmeri by sequencing and FAFLP. By case-control analysis, piperacillin-tazobactam was significantly associated with the K. ohmeri fungaemia. The FAFLP analysis showed that all K. ohmeri isolates had >92% similarity. The azoles and echinocandins had good in vitro activity against K. ohmeri, though 86.8% of the isolates had MIC of 1 mg/L for amphotericin B. The response to antifungal therapy could be evaluated in 27 patients and 70.4% of patients recovered after antifungal therapy. The present study reports the largest cluster of K. ohmeri fungaemia from a single centre. The study also stresses the need for accurate identification of clinical yeast isolates."

A head ultrasound 5 days after diagnosis was consistent with cystic periventricular leukomalacia. The scientific literature does not clearly elucidate differences between bacterial and viral infections in infants. When difficulties arise, it is pertinent to consider a viral etiology for the underlying illness and obtain a detailed maternal and infant history focusing on clinical symptoms, seasonality, geographic location, exposure, and incubation period. Polymerase chain reaction is a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test for the identification of enteroviruses in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, and throat specimens and should be performed as part of the general workup in the evaluation of a febrile infant with sepsis. In retrospect, it may have established an earlier diagnosis of meningitis, consequently preventing the unnecessary use of antibiotics, potentially decreasing the length of hospitalization, and eliminating the need for more detailed investigations to rule out other etiological factors. In addition, treatment with pleconaril may have affected the severity of the encephalitis.

CD011926,0,8989207,0,Vertical HIV-1 transmission correlates with a high maternal viral load at delivery.,"Transmission of HIV-1 from an infected mother to her child occurs in around 20% of cases. Although maternal, immunological, and virological factors have been implicated in transmission, clear association is not yet well defined. For this reason, we have conducted a study to determine the relative contribution of the above-mentioned factors with special emphasis on quantitative viral load. We studied 67 HIV-1-infected mothers during pregnancy and labor and their 69 newborns (two sets of twins) from two university hospitals in Barcelona. Plasma and cell samples were collected at delivery between January 1992 and May 1994, and HIV-1 RNA and p24 in plasma, CD4 cell counts, and tissue culture infectious doses (TCID) were measured. Diagnosis of infection in children was based on persistence of anti-HIV-1 antibodies at 18 months of age, a positive HIV-1 culture or polymerase chain reaction in two separate samples, or presence of signs or symptoms of AIDS before 18 months of age. Results showed a very high relationship between > 10(5)/ml viral RNA copies (odds ratio [OR] 22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-119.2, p < 0.00001), > 0.5 TCID (OR 17, 95% CI 2.1-139.7, p = 0.001), CDC B + C (OR 3.5, 95% CI 0.98-12.5, p = 0.055), < 400 CD4 cells (OR 4.1; 95% CL 1.1-15.4, p = 0.01) and transmission of HIV-1. In this study, a strong association between mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 and a high maternal viral RNA load in plasma at delivery is demonstrated. Viral load, which is related to clinical and immunological status in the mother, is the main contributing factor for HIV-1 vertical transmission, and these findings may have global and even individual therapeutic implications."

However, its transmission route remains unknown. We use rapid genome sequencing to investigate 3 cases of E. anophelis sepsis involving 2 neonates who had meningitis and 1 neonate's mother who had chorioamnionitis. Comparative genomics revealed evidence for perinatal vertical transmission from a mother to her neonate; the 2 isolates from these patients, HKU37 and HKU38, shared essentially identical genome sequences. In contrast, the strain from another neonate (HKU36) was genetically divergent, showing only 78.6% genome sequence identity to HKU37 and HKU38, thus excluding a clonal outbreak. Comparison to genomes from mosquito strains revealed potential metabolic adaptations in E. anophelis under different environments. Maternal infection, not mosquitoes, is most likely the source of neonatal E. anophelis infections. Our findings highlight the power of genome sequencing in gaining rapid insights on transmission and pathogenesis of emerging pathogens."

In addition, the positive detections of MLPA and DPO were identified using two different automatic electrophoresis systems. A panel of 168 culture-positive and negative samples was tested by the molecular assays for the presence of influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses and adenovirus. One hundred and twenty-nine (77%) samples were positive as detected by at least one method. Sixty-nine (41%) samples were positive by cell culture (excluding human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses), 116 (69%) by RT-PCR, 127 (76%) by MLPA and 100 (60%) by DPO. The MLPA yielded results in one attempt for all samples included while 12 (7.2%) samples had to be repeated by the DPO assay due to inconclusive results. The MLPA assay performed well in combination with either electrophoresis system, while the performance of the DPO assay was influenced by the electrophoresis systems. Both molecular assays are comparable with real-time RT-PCR, more sensitive than viral culture and can detect dual infections easily. Results can be obtained within 1 day."

HPeVs were sought in cerebrospinal fluid from 397 infants aged less than 12 months from whom a sample was obtained to exclude meningitis or encephalitis from 2006 to 2009. HPeV infections were also tested in stool samples from 271 children aged less than 3 years old with gastroenteritis from November 2008 to March 2009. HPeV detection was by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (region 5'UTR), followed by genotyping (region VP3/VP1). HPeVs were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of nine infants (2.3%), one aged 6 months and eight aged 14-55 days old. All were admitted to hospital for febrile syndrome with abrupt clinical deterioration and suspected systemic infection without clear laboratory signs of meningeal inflammation. The same virus was detected in all the available nasopharyngeal aspirates, stool, and/or serum samples from each patient. At least eight of the nine cases were caused by HPeV3. HPeVs were detected in stool samples from 17 children (6.3%), the most prevalent types being types 1 and 3. In conclusion, HPeV infection is common in the Basque Country (Spain) and HPeV3 is a significant cause of hospital admission due to systemic infection in the first few months of life. In these patients, HPeVs should be investigated as part of routine tests for enterovirus."

CD011926,0,21820550,0,Acute and congenital Chagas disease.,"The acute phase of Chagas disease lasts 4-8 weeks and is characterized by microscopically detectable parasitaemia. Symptoms are usually mild with severe acute disease occurring in less than 1% of patients. Orally transmitted Trypanosoma cruzi outbreaks can have more severe acute morbidity and higher mortality than vector-borne infection. Congenital T. cruzi infection occurs in 1-10% of infants of infected mothers. Most congenital infections are asymptomatic or cause non-specific signs, requiring laboratory screening for detection. A small proportion of congenital infections cause severe morbidity with hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, meningoencephalitis and/or respiratory insufficiency, with an associated high mortality. Infected infants are presumed to carry the same 20-30% lifetime risk of cardiac or gastrointestinal disease as other infected individuals. Most control programs in Latin America employ prenatal serological screening followed by microscopic examination of cord blood from infants of seropositive mothers. Recent data confirm that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is more sensitive and detects congenital infections earlier than conventional techniques. For infants not diagnosed at birth, conventional serology is recommended at at 6 to 9 months of age. In programs that have been evaluated, less than 20% of at risk infants completed all steps of the screening algorithm. A sensitive, specific and practical screening test for newborns is needed to enable Chagas disease to be added to newborn screening programs."

CD011926,0,18160455,0,Acinetobacter septicus sp. nov. association with a nosocomial outbreak of bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit.,"Acinetobacter species other than Acinetobacter baumannii have rarely been reported to be associated with nosocomial outbreaks of bloodstream infections. Within a period of 1 week, seven Acinetobacter-like isolates were recovered from peripheral blood and catheter specimens of five patients at a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in a tertiary hospital in Turkey. All five patients had placement of central venous catheters and had received total parenteral nutrition before the onset of bacteremia. Two of the five patients died. Medical devices, tap water, aerators, water samples, various surfaces, intravenous fluids, and the hands of health care workers in the NICU were sampled and were culture negative for the bacterium. All seven of the isolates had identical biochemical reactions, antimicrobial susceptibility results, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, indicating a clonal nosocomial outbreak. A panel of standard biochemical reaction profiles and three phenotypic commercial identification systems failed to identify these isolates. Phenotypically, the isolate differed from Acinetobacter ursingii by its hemolysis on sheep blood agar and its negative citrate utilization. Sequences of the full 16S rRNA gene, which contained at least three different gene copies with polymorphic sequences between nucleotide positions 70 and 206, were determined from the first recovered isolate. The complete 1,529- to 1,531-bp 16S rRNA gene sequences and partial 801-bp rpoB gene sequences had similarities of 99.5% and 97.2%, respectively, to an A. ursingii isolate. The DNA-DNA similarities of the strain against the type strain of A. ursingii were 64.7 and 68.7%, which were lower than the recommended threshold value of 70% for the definition of bacterial species. These data indicate that a novel Acinetobacter organism caused the nosocomial outbreak of bacteremia in the NICU unit. We propose the designation of Acinetobacter septicus sp. nov. for these isolates, with isolate AK001 as the type strain."

CD011926,0,24429371,0,Molecular epidemiology of contemporary G2P[4] human rotaviruses cocirculating in a single U.S. community: footprints of a globally transitioning genotype.,"Group A rotaviruses (RVs) remain a leading cause of childhood gastroenteritis worldwide. Although the G/P types of locally circulating RVs can vary from year to year and differ depending upon geographical location, those with G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and G12P[8] specificities typically dominate. Little is known about the evolution and diversity of G2P[4] RVs and the possible role that widespread vaccine use has had on their increased frequency of detection. To address these issues, we analyzed the 12 G2P[4] RV isolates associated with a rise in RV gastroenteritis cases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) during the 2010-2011 winter season. Full-genome sequencing revealed that the isolates had genotype 2 constellations typical of DS-1-like viruses (G2P[4]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2). Phylogenetic analyses showed that the genome segments of the isolates were comprised of two or three different subgenotype alleles; this enabled recognition of three distinct clades of G2P[4] viruses that caused disease at VUMC in the 2010-2011 season. Although the three clades cocirculated in the same community, there was no evidence of interclade reassortment. Bayesian analysis of 328 VP7 genes of G2 viruses isolated in the last 39 years indicate that existing G2 VP7 gene lineages continue to evolve and that novel lineages, as represented by the VUMC isolates, are constantly being formed. Moreover, G2 lineages are characteristically shaped by lineage turnover events that introduce new globally dominant strains every 7 years, on average. The ongoing evolution of G2 VP7 lineages may give rise to antigenic changes that undermine vaccine effectiveness in the long term."
CD011926,0,10203485,0,Laboratory diagnosis of common viral infections of the central nervous system by using a single multiplex PCR screening assay.,"A multiplex PCR assay that detects the four commonest causes of viral meningitis and encephalitis in the United Kingdom (herpes simplex virus [HSV] type 1 [HSV-1], HSV type 2 [HSV-2], varicella-zoster virus [VZV], and enteroviruses) was developed, and its sensitivity was compared with those of similar assays described previously for this application. Compared to the previous assays, this single multiplex PCR assay had higher molecular sensitivities for the detection for each of the viruses and improved utility for routine use in a diagnostic laboratory. The assay was used to test a series of 1,683 consecutive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples between June 1997 and March 1998 inclusively. Viral nucleic acid was detected in 138 (8.2%) of the CSF samples, including enteroviruses in 51 samples, HSV-2 in 33 samples, VZV in 28 samples, and HSV-1 in 25 samples.

We validated commonly used C. difficile diagnostic tests in a paediatric hospital population. From October 2011 to January 2012, 150 consecutive stools were collected from 75 patients at a tertiary paediatric hospital in Perth, Western Australia. Stools were tested using: C. Diff Quik Chek Complete, Illumigene C. difficile, GeneOhm Cdiff, cycloserine cefoxitin fructose agar (CCFA) culture, and cell culture cytotoxin neutralisation assay (CCNA). The reference standard was growth on CCFA or Cdiff Chromagar and PCR on isolates to detect tcdA, tcdB, cdtA, and cdtB. Isolates were PCR ribotyped. The prevalence of CDI was high (43 % of patients). Quik Chek Complete glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) demonstrated a low negative predictive value (NPV) (93 %). Both CCNA and Quik Chek Complete toxin A/B had poor sensitivity (33 % and 29 % respectively). Molecular methods both had 89 % sensitivity. Algorithms using GDH + Illumigene or GeneOhm reduced the sensitivity to 85 % and 83 % respectively. Ribotype UK014/20 predominated. GDH NPV and GeneOhm and Illumigene sensitivities were reduced compared with adult studies. Quik Chek Complete and CCNA cannot reliably detect toxigenic CDI.

Early diagnosis and treatment with a bone-marrow transplant markedly improves long-term outcomes. On January 1, 2008, the newborn screening (NBS) program in Wisconsin became the first in the world to routinely test all newborns for SCID. A realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay measures T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), which are formed during the maturation of normal T-cells. A lack or very low number of TRECs is consistent with T-cell lymphopenia. The development and validation of the TREC assay and the results of the first year of screening have been published.

CD011926,0,17004294,0,Diagnosis of congenital CMV infection via dried blood spots.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most frequent congenital infection in humans and can cause permanent damage--particularly neurological--in about 20% of those infected, with or without symptoms at birth. Laboratory diagnosis is essential on account of the relatively non-specific clinical manifestations in symptomatic newborns but also because of the high frequency of asymptomatic cases that are nevertheless at risk of lesions later in life. However, these tests need samples taken within 3 weeks of birth to distinguish congenital infection from the more common, but clinically benign, perinatal infection. Tests for viral DNA have proved a valid means of diagnosing congenital CMV infection in neonatal blood dried on paper (DBS) widely used in screening for metabolic and genetic diseases, as an alternative to the conventional urine culture method. The DBS test is simpler, faster and less costly than viral isolation; in addition the samples can be safely stored for long periods, so diagnosis can be made even after several years. The sensitivity and specificity of the DBS test, compared to the reference method, have been reported to range between 71 and 100% and 99 and 100%, respectively, depending on the different studies and diagnostic criteria applied. The most interesting applications reported so far involve retrospective determination of the impact of congenital CMV in sensorineural deafness, abnormalities of cortical development, neonatal cholestasis and surveys of the prevalence of this infection in various populations. The test might be useful in the future for neonatal screening with a view to treating neonates and so avoiding the damage this disease can cause."
CD011926,0,18428125,0,Molecular epidemiological study of HEV-B enteroviruses involved in the increase in meningitis cases occurred in Spain during 2006.,"Human enteroviruses are one of the main etiological agents of aseptic meningitis and other central nervous system infections, particularly the serotypes included in the enterovirus B species. Molecular methods have proved useful to identify serotypes in clinical samples, facilitating the epidemiological study of these viruses. In the spring of 2006, there was a significant increase in meningitis cases caused by enteroviruses in Spain. In the present study, 138 enteroviruses directly detected in clinical samples of patients with aseptic meningitis (n = 116) and other neurological pathologies (n = 22) received by the National Center for Microbiology during the year, were genotyped by amplification and sequencing part of the VP1 region and phylogenetic analysis. Echovirus 30 was the most frequent serotype, followed in decreasing order by echovirus 6, 9, 13, 18, enterovirus 75, coxsackievirus A9, echovirus 11, 14, 29, 4, and coxsackievirus B4 and B5. Phylogenetic analysis with all Spanish echovirus 30 strains detected in 2006 and other reported echovirus 30 sequences, demonstrated that Spanish strains formed a new lineage, different from others previously described. In conclusion, echovirus 30 is the most commonly reported enterovirus serotype associated with aseptic meningitis in Spain. Direct molecular typing of clinical samples also allows rapid identification of the serotypes involved in an epidemic alert and phylogenetic analysis in the 3'-VP1 region is useful to study viral epidemiology."

A total of 400 stool specimens were obtained from children under 5 years of age from July 2012 to June 2013. Primers were designed based on conserved sequences flanking the flaA gene that encompassed and amplified the entire flaA gene and followed by sequencing and data analysis with MEGA version 6.0.6 software. Ninety amino acids and 560 nucleotide polymorphic sequences were detected within 1,681 bp of the flaA sequence of which 43 (2.5%) and 12 (0.7%) were singletons, respectively. New repeat boxes within the flaA sequences were found in this study. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean dendrogram based on nucleotides of the full length flaA gene, the flaA short variable region gene and the in silico flaA phylogenic tree of DdeI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles produced very similar clustering with a diversity index of 0.86 for each of the 3 methods. We conclude that flaA typing based on DdeI RFLP of the PCR products is a cheap, rapid, and reliable method for the epidemiological study of C. jejuni isolates of clinical origin in resource-limited regions or in large-scale population surveillance."

Listeria monocytogenes isolates were provided by the clinical microbiology laboratories of the Lombardy region and the ""Careggi"" Hospital of Florence, Tuscany, Italy. Serotyping, PFGE after digestion with the AscI and ApaI enzymes, and PCR amplification for the inlA, inlC, and inlJ genes and ECI, ECII, and ECIII markers were performed according to procedures described previously. Twenty-five (46.3%) L. monocytogenes isolates were assigned to serotype 1/2a, 23 (42.6%) to serotype 4b, and 6 (11.1%) to serotype 1/2b. Thirty-one AscI pulsotypes were recognized among the 54 human isolates. Eleven molecular subtype clusters, of which eight included indistinguishable pulsotypes and three included closely related pulsotypes, were shared by two to seven isolates. Fifteen isolates exhibited unique AscI pulsotypes. Three groups of clustered isolates and two apparently sporadic isolates generated EC amplicons. All strains tested positive for the inlA, inlC, and inlJ genes. Based on the results of serotyping and molecular typing, there were 11 occasions when L. monocytogenes strains with the same subtype were isolated from more than one listeriosis case. A total of 39 out of 54 isolates (72.2%) were attributed to molecular subtype clusters. The results of the study suggest that routine subtyping of L. monocytogenes strains from human listeriosis cases could allow more-timely detection of outbreaks possibly caused by food-borne isolates from a common source and could lead to control of ongoing food exposure, thus preventing the occurrence of more cases."

Twenty-five anti-HCV-positive women with no apparent source of HCV exposure were recruited. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a new quantitative branched DNA-based signal amplification assay (bDNA) were used to detect HCV RNA. The rate of anti-HCV positivity in pregnant women was 2.5% (36 of 1,388). Of the 25 cohort mothers, 18 (72%) were positive for HCV RNA by RT-PCR, 13 of whom were also positive by the bDNA assay (sensitivity 72.2%). Of the 25 infants of low-risk mothers tested at birth, 22 were anti-HCV positive, two were weakly reactive, one was negative, and none was viremic. Neither active humoral immunoresponse nor HCV RNA was detected in any of the infants over a period of 12 months. These data suggest a relatively high prevalence of anti-HCV in unselected pregnant women and a poor efficiency of vertical transmission of HCV in a low-risk population, irrespective of the viral burden of the mother-to-be."
CD011926,0,23861138,0,Concurrent detection of other respiratory viruses in children shedding viable human respiratory syncytial virus.,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is an important cause of respiratory disease. The majority of studies addressing the importance of virus co-infections to the HRSV-disease have been based on the detection of HRSV by RT-PCR, which may not distinguish current replication from prolonged shedding of remnant RNA from previous HRSV infections. To assess whether co-detections of other common respiratory viruses are associated with increased severity of HRSV illnesses from patients who were shedding viable-HRSV, nasopharyngeal aspirates from children younger than 5 years who sought medical care for respiratory infections in Ribeirão Preto (Brazil) were tested for HRSV by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and virus isolation in cell culture. All samples with viable-HRSV were tested further by PCR for other respiratory viruses. HRSV-disease severity was assessed by a clinical score scale. A total of 266 samples from 247 children were collected and 111 (42%) were HRSV-positive. HRSV was isolated from 70 (63%), and 52 (74%) of them were positive for at least one additional virus. HRSV-positive diseases were more severe than HRSV-negative ones, but there was no difference in disease severity between patients with viable-HRSV and those HRSV-positives by RT-PCR. Co-detection of other viruses did not correlate with increased disease severity. HRSV isolation in cell culture does not seem to be superior to RT-PCR to distinguish infections associated with HRSV replication in studies of clinical impact of HRSV. A high rate of co-detection of other respiratory viruses was found in samples with viable-HRSV, but this was not associated with more severe HRSV infection."
CD011926,0,12791877,0,Multilocus sequence typing system for group B streptococcus.,"A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) system was developed for group B streptococcus (GBS). The system was used to characterize a collection (n = 152) of globally and ecologically diverse human strains of GBS that included representatives of capsular serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, V, VI, and VIII. Fragments (459 to 519 bp) of seven housekeeping genes were amplified by PCR for each strain and sequenced. The combination of alleles at the seven loci provided an allelic profile or sequence type (ST) for each strain. A subset of the strains were characterized by restriction digest patterning, and these results were highly congruent with those obtained with MLST. There were 29 STs, but 66% of isolates were assigned to four major STs. ST-1 and ST-19 were significantly associated with asymptomatic carriage, whereas ST-23 included both carried and invasive strains. All 44 isolates of ST-17 were serotype III clones, and this ST appeared to define a homogeneous clone that was strongly associated with neonatal invasive infections. The finding that isolates with different capsular serotypes had the same ST suggests that recombination occurs at the capsular locus. A web site for GBS MLST was set up and can be accessed at http://sagalactiae.mlst.net. The GBS MLST system offers investigators a valuable typing tool that will promote further investigation of the population biology of this organism."
CD011926,0,17333731,0,"Silent transmission of virus during a Dengue epidemic, Nakhon Pathom Province, Thailand 2001.","In the year 2001 a large dengue fever (DF)/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) outbreak occurred in Nakhon Pathom Province, Thailand. Three thousand one hundred twelve cases of DHF were reported, an attack rate of 393 per 100,000 population. The Nakhon Pathom Provincial Health Office immediately carried out a control action according to WHO recommendations. Active serological surveys and viral RNA isolation were carried out to detect silent transmission of dengue virus in 329 healthy volunteers in Nakhon Pathom Province subdistricts where the dengue epidemic had the highest rate of infection of 2.5 per 1000. Eight point eight percent of these volunteers had a serum sample positive for DF/DHF virus IgM antibody. The highest prevalence occurred in the 15 to 40 year old group. In two instances viral RNA was detected by PCR and dengue serotype 3 was subsequently identified. The data support the hypothesis of subclinical infection with dengue virus. This high frequency of virus circulation combined with a high population density, urbanization and increasing breeding sites for mosquitoes, needs to be taken into account in the evaluation of viral transmission during and after epidemics. This underlines the importance of community-based control in informing people of their involvement in virus transmission and the importance of personal protection."

CD011926,0,26494728,0,The Role of 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing in Confirmation of Suspected Neonatal Sepsis.,"Different molecular assays for the detection of bacterial DNA in the peripheral blood represented a diagnostic tool for neonatal sepsis. We targeted to evaluate the role of 16S rRNA gene sequencing to screen for bacteremia to confirm suspected neonatal sepsis (NS) and compare with risk factors and septic screen testing. Sixty-two neonates with suspected NS were enrolled. White blood cells count, I/T ratio, C-reactive protein, blood culture and 16S rRNA sequencing were performed. Blood culture was positive in 26% of cases, and PCR was positive in 26% of cases. Evaluation of PCR for the diagnosis of NS showed sensitivity 62.5%, specificity 86.9%, PPV 62.5%, NPV 86.9% and accuracy of 79.7%. 16S rRNA PCR increased the sensitivity of detecting bacterial DNA in newborns with signs of sepsis from 26 to 35.4%, and its use can be limited to cases with the most significant risk factors and positive septic screen."
CD011926,0,9139086,0,Detection of latent varicella-zoster virus infection in human vestibular and spiral ganglia.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) becomes latent in the sensory ganglia after primary infection and VZV DNA has been found in human trigeminal, thoracic, and geniculate ganglia. In this study, human vestibular and spiral ganglia, which do not received innervation from the skin, were examined for VZV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. VZV DNA was detected in 2 of 10 (20%) vestibular ganglia and in 2 of 10 (20%) spiral ganglia from five adults. VZV DNA was undetectable in either type of ganglion from a newborn and from two of the five adults. These two adults were VZV seronegative. The results indicate that VZV becomes latent in several types of sensory ganglion after primary infection and suggest the possibility that reactivation of the virus from the vestibular and spiral ganglia may cause disorders in the labyrinth."
CD011926,0,16240696,0,"The prevalence and molecular typing of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains isolated from diarrheic stools in Malatya, Turkey.","This study was performed from June 2002 to November 2003 year in Malatya, eastern Turkey. Stools of 172 diarrheic patients and 90 healthy controls were analysed for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) toxins were investigated by passive latex agglutination and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Nine ETEC strains were isolated from 172 diarrheic stools (5.2%). Seven of the ETEC strains (10.1%) were isolated from 69 children in the 0-5 year age group. Two of these pediatric isolates were ST positive (2.9%) and five were LT positive (7.2%). ETEC was not isolated in the 6-18 year age group. Two ST producing E. coli strains were detected in diarrheic adult patients (> 18 years). In the 90 controls, two ETEC strains were detected (2.2%). One of them was a LT producer (1.1%) and the other was a ST producer (1.1%). E. coli strains producing both toxins simultaneously were not observed. ETEC positivity was higher in the diarrheic group than in the control group but statistically not significant (p > 0.05). The rate of resistance among ETEC strains to cefuroxime axetil, ampicillin, piperacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was 72.7%, 54.5%, 45.5%, and 36.4%, respectively whereas the resistance rate to the same antibiotics in non-ETEC strains was 14%, 62%, 54%, and 66%, respectively. All ETEC isolates were intermediately resistant to cephalothin and fully susceptible to other antibiotics tested. Typing of the ETEC strains was done by arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR). Only two LT strains of the 11 typed strains had a unique profile. The remaining nine were mixed LT and ST strains and divided into two groups. The first group had three strains having a similarity coefficient ranging from 70-90%. The other one had six strains, five of them were similar and one was subtype isolate. It can be concluded that ETEC strains might be considerably important enteropathogens especially in pediatric patients in the 0-5 year age group. High clonal relation indicated that ETEC strains were epidemiologically related."
CD011926,0,16157552,0,Human metapneumovirus infections in Mexico: epidemiological and clinical characteristics.,"The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently described respiratory RNA virus that mainly affects children. To date there has not been a report that describes the detection of this virus in Mexico. This study was performed to detect hMPV in hospitalized Mexican children with respiratory infections, and describe their epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Nasal wash samples from 558 children younger than 3 years of age with the admission diagnosis of a respiratory tract infection were evaluated. Respiratory viruses were detected in 221 children [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 193 (34.6 %); influenza virus, 13 (2.3 %); parainfluenza viruses, 15 (2.7 %)]. Respiratory secretions of 323 children in whom the presence of these viruses was excluded (131 admitted during the 2002-2003 respiratory season and 192 during the 2003-2004 season) were tested for hMPV infection. The hMPV genome was detected in 34 specimens by amplification using real-time RT-PCR. Sequencing of amplicons and phylogenetic analysis indicated the predominance of genotype A hMPV. The months with the highest number of hMPV detections were February and March. During the 2002-2003 season hMPV activity peaked after the RSV season. During the 2003-2004 season hMPV and RSV epidemics occurred simultaneously. The clinical presentation of an hMPV infection was indistinguishable from other respiratory infections. Except for one death, the outcomes of the hMPV infections were good. In this study, among the viruses routinely tested for, hMPV was the second most common agent, after RSV, in children younger than 3 years of age hospitalized with respiratory tract infections."
CD011926,0,11263545,0,Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency human genome epidemiology review.,"Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is a tetrameric flavoprotein essential for the beta-oxidation of medium chain fatty acids. MCAD deficiency (MCADD) is an inherited error of fatty acid metabolism. The gene for MCAD is located on chromosome one (1p31). One variant of the MCAD gene, G985A, a point mutation causing a change from lysine to glutamate at position 304 (K304E) in the mature MCAD protein, has been found in 90% of the alleles in MCADD patients identified retrospectively. There is a high frequency of MCADD among people of Northern European descent, which is believed to be due to a founder effect. MCADD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Of patients clinically diagnosed with MCADD, 81% who have been identified retrospectively are homozygous for K304E, and 18% are compound heterozygotes for K304E. Clinical data on the probability of clinical disease indicates that MCADD patients are at risk for the following outcomes: hypoglycemia, vomiting, lethargy, encephalopathy, respiratory arrest, hepatomegaly, seizures, apnea, cardiac arrest, coma, and sudden and unexpected death. Long-term outcomes include developmental and behavioral disability, chronic muscle weakness, failure to thrive, cerebral palsy, and attention deficit disorder (ADD). Differences in clinical disease specific to allelic variants have not been documented. Factors that may increase risk for disease onset or modify disease severity are age when the first episode occurred, fasting, and presence of infection. Acute attacks must be treated immediately with appropriate intravenous doses of glucose. For those diagnosed, long-term management of the disease includes preventing stress caused by fasting and maintaining a high-carbohydrate, reduced-fat diet, and carnitine supplementation. Hospitalization costs attributable to morbidity and mortality from MCADD are unknown; MCADD is not a diagnosis in the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codebook. Furthermore, the penetrance of the MCAD genotypes is unknown; there appears to be a substantial number of asymptomatic MCADD individuals and some uncertainty regarding which individuals will manifest symptoms and which individuals will remain asymptomatic. Several technologies are available to detect MCADD. Diagnostic technologies include DNA-based tests for K304E mutations using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the detection of abnormal metabolites in urine. Screening technologies include tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), which detects abnormal metabolites mostly in blood. State programs are beginning to offer screening in newborns for MCADD using MS/MS. In addition, a private company currently offers voluntary supplemental newborn screening for MCADD to birthing centers."
CD011926,0,19878694,0,Cross-contamination during processing of dried blood spots used for rapid diagnosis of HIV-1 infection of infants is rare and avoidable.,"Dried blood spot (DBS) samples are a convenient way to collect infant blood for HIV-1 diagnostic testing. Minimizing the risk of false positives is critical for diagnostic tests. A protocol for processing and testing DBS for infant HIV-1 diagnosis was evaluated to identify the rate and source of false-positive results. DBS were created on Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter paper with 500 copies/punch (high) or 5000 copies/punch (very high) concentrations of HIV-1 DNA. Blank discs of filter paper punched after DBS samples were tested for carry-over of HIV-1 DNA using nested PCR for the pol region. No false positives were detected in the 40 series using high concentration DBS. In series with very high concentrations of HIV-1, 8/246 (3%) reactions were falsely positive. When tubes were spun prior to opening, contact with caps minimized, and spaces left between lanes of the gel, repeat second-round PCR of five false positives resulted in only one repeat false-positive PCR. This study outlines procedures that minimize false-positive results for nested PCR of HIV-1 DNA from DBS."
CD011926,0,9139088,0,Analysis of mother-to-infant transmission of hepatitis C virus: quasispecies nature and buoyant densities of maternal virus populations.,"Mother-to-infant transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was analyzed by sequencing of viral RNA and semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction following ultracentrifugation of maternal sera. In two mother-infant pairs, the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) and carboxyl terminus of envelope 1 (E1) were sequenced. Both viral sequences in the infants were less diverse than those of their mothers. Although the E1 sequences were almost identical in each mother-infant pair, the HVR1 sequences of the infants were related, but not identical, to those of the mothers. Serial examinations of one infant revealed that the HVR1 nucleotide sequence did not change from 10 days to 3 months of age. In six mothers with uninfected infants, all of the dense fractions of sera contained significant amounts of HCV RNA, whereas in six mothers with infected infants, only two of those fractions contained significant amounts of HCV RNA. These results indicate that the strains of HCV detected in the infants were not dominant in the mothers, but were still transmissible to the infants. As dense fractions are known to contain antibody-bound HCV particles, maternal antibodies against HCV may inhibit viral transmission."
CD011926,0,21786334,0,Correlation of Chlamydia and Chlamydophila spp. IgG and IgM antibodies by microimmunofluorescence with antigen detection methods.,"Correlation of serologic titers for Chlamydia trachomatis with other tests has been based on direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) testing and culture, but not on nucleic acid-based tests that are used for screening. We retrospectively reviewed the specificity of antibodies against C. trachomatis, Chlamydia psittaci, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence (MIF) when compared with DFA, culture, nucleic acid probe, and transcription-mediated amplification. Over a 6-year period, 226 cases had both MIF and one of these other methods performed for comparison. Agreement between C. trachomatis antigen or nucleic acid detection and MIF results was 87% (197/226). C. trachomatis serology had a negative predictive value of 98%, and 10.6% of cases were positive by serology and negative by antigen testing. Of the 13 patients who had a positive C. trachomatis antigen or nucleic acid test result, 9 had IgG and/or IgM titers highest against C. trachomatis, 3 had IgG titers highest against C. pneumoniae, and 1 had undetectable titers for the three chlamydial species. Twenty-five patients had positive IgG and/or IgM titers to C. trachomatis but negative antigen test results. Serologic testing can increase the sensitivity of detecting C. trachomatis infections."

Current detection in stools is done essentially by culture on selective and nonselective media with filtration. These methods were compared to 2 molecular biology methods, an in-house real-time PCR and a multiplex PCR named Seeplex Diarrhea ACE Detection, and 3 immunoenzymatic methods, Premier Campy, RidaScreen Campylobacter, and ImmunoCard Stat!Campy. Out of 242 stool specimens tested, 23 (9.5%) fulfilled the positivity criteria, i.e., they were positive by one or both culture methods or, in case of a negative culture, by a positive molecular method and a positive immunoenzymatic method. The striking feature of this study is the low sensitivity of culture, in the range of 60%, in contrast to immunoenzymatic and molecular tests."
CD011926,0,15956406,0,Analysis of Bordetella pertussis populations in European countries with different vaccination policies.,"Despite the widespread use of pertussis vaccines during the last decades, pertussis has remained an endemic disease with frequent epidemic outbreaks. Currently two types of vaccines are used: whole-cell vaccines (WCVs) and recently developed acellular vaccines (ACVs). The long-term aim of our studies is to assess the effect of different vaccination policies on the population structure of Bordetella pertussis and ultimately on the disease burden in Europe. In the present study, a total of 102 B. pertussis isolates from the period 1998 to 2001 from five European countries (Finland, Sweden, Germany, The Netherlands, and France) were characterized. The isolates were analyzed by typing based on variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR); by sequencing of polymorphic genes encoding the surface proteins pertussis toxin S1 and S3 subunits (ptxA and ptxC), pertactin (prn), and tracheal colonization factor (tcfA); and by fimbrial serotyping. The results reveal a relationship between geographic location and VNTR types, the frequency of the ptxC alleles, and serotypes. We have not observed a relationship between the strain characteristics we studied and vaccination programs. Our results provide a baseline which can be used to reveal changes in the B. pertussis population in Europe in the coming years."

CD011926,0,22740612,1,Non-culture detection of Streptococcus agalactiae (Lancefield group B Streptococcus) in clinical samples by real-time PCR.,"A real-time PCR assay targeting the cylB gene was developed to detect Streptococcus agalactiae [Lancefield group B Streptococcus (GBS)] from clinical samples. A total of 110 blood culture-negative samples [75 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 35 EDTA blood samples] from neonates with probable GBS sepsis or meningitis were analysed. Among these, 16 of the 75 CSF samples were positive [21.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 12.7-32.3%] and two of the 35 EDTA blood samples were positive (5.7%, 95% CI 0.7-19.2%). The proportion testing positive in the CSF samples was significantly higher than in the EDTA blood samples (P=0.05, Fisher's exact test). Overall, this real-time PCR assay was shown to be superior to culture methods for detection of GBS from CSF and EDTA blood samples."
CD011926,0,23049948,0,Mass spectrometry detection of G3m and IGHG3 alleles and follow-up of differential mother and neonate IgG3.,"Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis for detection of immunoglobulins (IG) of the human IgG3 subclass is described that relies on polymorphic amino acids of the heavy gamma3 chains. IgG3 is the most polymorphic human IgG subclass with thirteen G3m allotypes located on the constant CH2 and CH3 domains of the gamma3 chain, the combination of which leads to six major G3m alleles. Amino acid changes resulting of extensive sequencing previously led to the definition of 19 IGHG3 alleles that have been correlated to the G3m alleles. As a proof of concept, MS proteotypic peptides were defined which encompass discriminatory amino acids for the identification of the G3m and IGHG3 alleles. Plasma samples originating from ten individuals either homozygous or heterozygous for different G3m alleles, and including one mother and her baby (drawn sequentially from birth to 9 months of age), were analyzed. Total IgG3 were purified using affinity chromatography and then digested by a combination of AspN and trypsin proteases, and peptides of interest were detected by mass spectrometry. The sensitivity of the method was assessed by mixing variable amounts of two plasma samples bearing distinct G3m allotypes. A label-free approach using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) retention time of peptides and their MS mass analyzer peak intensity gave semi-quantitative information. Quantification was realized by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) using synthetic peptides as internal standards. The possibility offered by this new methodology to detect and quantify neo-synthesized IgG in newborns will improve knowledge on the first acquisition of antibodies in infants and constitutes a promising diagnostic tool for vertically-transmitted diseases."

CD011926,0,25704492,0,Changing patterns of rotavirus strains circulating in Ireland: re-emergence of G2P[4] and identification of novel genotypes in Ireland.,"Worldwide, Group A Rotavirus (RVA) is recognized as the most common aetiological agent of acute diarrheal disease in children. One hundred and ninety seven positive faecal samples were obtained from patients between 2006 and 2008. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify the VP7 and VP4 gene segments of these samples, and G and P typing was carried out subsequently. The most common strain type was G1P[8], and the emergent global G9-type was identified in both years. RVA strain type G2P[4], previously reported in Ireland in 1999, was also detected. Genotypes G2 and G3 in combination with P[4] were detected in 2006-2007 only. There was also an emergence of strain types including G3P[4], G9P[4], G2P[4 + 8] and G2G4P[8] in this study. Molecular analysis of the VP7 genes revealed G1 strains circulating within lineage Ic as previously reported in Ireland. In addition, new sublineage within lineage I of G1 strains was also identified. Analysis of G4 strain NRVL-Hum-49 revealed similarity with other human G4 viruses in lineage Ib. G9 strain NRVL-Hum-74 clustered with a unique G9 strain, CIT-254, in lineage IIIc. This data supports the observations made that the profile of RVA strains in Ireland appears to be dynamic. This study demonstrates that the circulation of human rotavirus is changing continuously in Ireland, and continued surveillance of the circulating strains is needed to detect the appearance of new strains, or new variants which may lead to vaccine breakthrough."
CD011926,0,9806033,0,Increased transmission of vertical hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected infants of HIV- and HCV-coinfected women.,"The transmission of perinatal hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was studied retrospectively in 62 infants born to 54 HCV- and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected women enrolled in a prospective natural history study of HIV transmission. Infant HCV infection was assessed by nested RNA polymerase chain reaction. The overall rate of vertical HCV transmission was 16.4% (9/62). Most HCV-infected children did not develop antibodies to HCV. The rate of HCV infection was higher among HIV-infected infants (40%) than among HIV-uninfected infants (7.5%; odds ratio, 8.2; P = .009). This difference in transmission was not related to differences in maternal HCV load, as measured by branched DNA assay, or mode of delivery. Why HIV-infected infants of HCV- and HIV-coinfected women have significantly higher rates of perinatal HCV transmission remains to be elucidated. The rate of HCV transmission in HIV-uninfected infants of HCV- and HIV-coinfected women is similar to that reported for infants born to HIV-seronegative mothers."
CD011926,0,8360312,0,Detection of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection by the polymerase chain reaction using dried blood specimens on filter papers.,"A simple method for detection of proviral DNA sequences of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was developed using dried blood specimens on filter papers. The whole blood was blotted onto the Guthrie paper. After the blood has dried, the blotted paper was punched out into small discs. The discs were then boiled to prepare the template for PCR (filter paper-PCR method). The filter paper-PCR method detected even a single HTLV-1-infected cell in three discs. The sensitivity of the filter paper-PCR method was equivalent to that of the method in which DNA was extracted with phenol and used as the template for PCR (DNA extraction-PCR method). In addition, DNA in the blotted filter paper was still utilizable as the template after the storage at 25 degrees C for at least 7 wk. A total of 53 clinical specimens from 30 seropositive and 23 seronegative individuals who were screened by particle agglutination (PA) test were analysed for HTLV-1 DNA by both PCR methods. Of 30 PA-positive specimens, 28 were also positive for HTLV-1 antibody by Western blot (WB) analysis, but two were indeterminate. The twenty eight WB-positive and one of the two indeterminate specimens were positive for HTLV-1 proviral DNA by both PCR methods. Of 23 PA-negative specimens, 22 were negative for HTLV-1 proviral DNA by both PCR methods. However, one PA-negative specimen was positive by both PCR methods. This patient was a 16-mth-old infant who was born to an HTLV-1 carrier mother and fed thereafter without her breast milk. In comparison to DNA extraction-PCR method, the sensitivity and specificity of the filter paper-PCR method was 100%, respectively."

CD011926,0,24667303,0,"Single genome amplification of proviral HIV-1 DNA from dried blood spot specimens collected during early infant screening programs in Lusaka, Zambia.","The ability to evaluate individual HIV-1 virions from the quasispecies of vertically infected infants was evaluated in a field setting at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia. Infant heel-prick blood specimens were spotted onto dried blood spot (DBS) filter paper cards at government health clinics. Nucleic acid was extracted and used as a template for HIV-1 proviral DNA detection by a commercial Amplicor HIV-1 PCR test (Roche, version 1.5). On samples that tested positive by commercial diagnostic assay, amplification of DNA was performed using an in-house assay of the 5' and 3' region of the HIV-1 genome. Additionally, fragments covering 1200 nucleotides within pol (full length protease and partial reverse transcriptase) and 1400 nucleotides within env (variable 1-variable 5 region) were further analyzed by single genome amplification (SGA). In summary, we have demonstrated an in-house assay for amplifying the 5' and 3' proviral HIV-1 DNA as well as pol and env proviral DNA fragments from DBS cards collected and analyzed entirely in Zambia. In conclusion, this study shows the feasibility of utilizing DBS cards to amplify the whole proviral HIV-1 genome as well as perform SGA on key HIV-1 genes."

Isolates were characterized by staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec type, the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, repetitive sequence (rep) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), requirement for surgical intervention, antibiograms, and response to therapy. rep-PCR was more rapid than PFGE typing and correlated well. SCCmec type IV-containing isolates caused 92.8% of all infections, but the demographics and diseases associated with subtypes IVa and IVd differed. Subtype IVa (all PFGE type USA300 and PVL-positive) was identified in 81/93 (87.1%) of patients with community-onset (CO) MRSA, including 21/35 of those with risk factors for health care-associated (HA) infection. All other clones were PVL-negative. Subtype IVd (10 isolates; 9 USA800 and 1 eMRSA15) caused mainly HA-MRSA and no skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). Seven classic HA-MRSA strains (SCCmec types II [6; 3 USA100 and 3 USA600] and III [1; USA200]) caused HA and hospital-onset (HO) infections. Surgical intervention was required in 68/81 patients infected with USA300 and 8/17 of the others. Most USA300 were susceptible (S) to clindamycin (CD) and patients were treated with CD alone or in combination. The other isolates were generally treated with vancomycin (VA) alone or in combination."
CD011926,0,10863105,0,Antimicrobial susceptibilities and serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae in southwestern Japan and correlation of penicillin-binding protein 2b and 2x mutations in susceptibilities of penicillin G and cefotaxime.,"MICs of penicillin G and other drugs and serotypes were determined for 218 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from children in southwestern Japan. Twenty-one (9.6%) and 81 (37.2%) isolates were penicillin-resistant (MIC >/=2.0 microg/ml) and intermediate (MIC 0.13-1.0 microg/ml), respectively. Panipenem was most active parenteral agent against penicillin-intermediate (MIC(90) 0.125 microg/ml) and -resistant strains (MIC(90) 0.25 microg/ml). Among oral beta-lactam agents, cefditoren had good activity against penicillin-intermediate and resistant strains (MIC(90) 0.5/1.0 microg/ml). Serogroup 6 was the most prevalent (65/218) among all strains and 19F (44 strains) was the most prevalent among penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains. Both pbp2b resistant and susceptible genes were found in penicillin-intermediate strains. Pbp2x resistant genes were found in 33 of 80 (41.3%) cefotaxime-susceptible strains. These results suggest that possible resistance mechanisms may occur even in drug susceptible strains and that drug susceptibility survey should be updated carefully in Japan."
CD011926,0,14715728,0,Clonal and horizontal dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae expressing SHV-5 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in a Mexican pediatric hospital.,"One hundred eighty-four clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were recovered from August 1996 to October 1997 at the Pediatric Hospital of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in Mexico City, Mexico. Most of the isolates were collected from the neonatal intensive care unit and infant wards, which are located on the same floor of the hospital. Isolates were genotypically compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with XbaI restriction of chromosomal DNA. Of 184 clinical isolates, 91 belonged to cluster A and comprised three subtypes (A1, A2, and A3), while 93 isolates, comprising two minor clones, B (10 isolates) and C (7 isolates), and 76 unique patterns, were considered unrelated isolates (URI). Susceptibility patterns were indistinguishable in both groups. Fifty extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates, including 34 from clone A and 16 from URI, were examined for further studies. Molecular and genetic analysis showed that 47 of 50 clinical isolates expressed the SHV-5 beta-lactamase. This enzyme, in combination with TEM-1, was encoded in a >or=170-kb conjugative plasmid. Results indicate that dissemination of this resistance was due to clonal and horizontal spread."
CD011926,0,18227604,0,The use of dried blood spots on filter paper for the diagnosis of HIV-1 in infants born to HIV seropositive women.,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most sensitive test to diagnose HIV-1 infection among infants born to HIV seropositive mothers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of dried blood spot (DBS) specimens for PCR and to compare it with whole-blood stored in tubes for HIV-1 DNA PCR. Five hundred and seventy-seven whole-blood infant samples were tested using HIV-1 qualitative in-house nested DNA PCR. Three hundred and fifty-nine samples were from infants at 48 hours of birth and 218 samples at second month. All positive samples tested from whole-blood and every fifth negative sample were coated onto filter paper. DNA was extracted from the filter paper and was amplified using in-house nested PCR. Among the whole-blood samples tested using HIV-1 DNA PCR, 19 of 359 (5.29%) samples were HIV-1 positive and 340 (94.7%) were negative at 48 hours of birth. At second month, 19 (8.7%) of the 218 samples were positive and 199 (91.2%) were negative. Using dried filter paper, 18 samples (95%) tested positive from 19 positive samples (using whole-blood) and 1 tested negative at 48 hours of birth. The 68 negative samples tested using whole-blood were also negative in the DBS test (sensitivity 95% and specificity 100%). At second month, 19 were positive and 40 samples (every fifth sample of 199) were negative (sensitivity and specificity, 100%). PCR performed using DNA extracted from filter paper permits the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection among infants born to HIV-1 seropositive mothers. This assay is simple, rapid, sensitive and specific and can be used in resource limited settings."

Forty-two cases of suspected transient HIV-1 viremia among 1562 perinatally exposed seroreverting infants and one mother were reanalyzed. HIV-1 env sequences were not found in specimens from 20; in specimens from 6, somatic genetic analysis revealed that specimens were mistakenly attributed to an infant; and in specimens from 17, phylogenetic analysis failed to demonstrate the expected linkage between the infant's and the mother's virus. These findings argue that transient HIV-1 infection, if it exists, will only rarely be satisfactorily documented."

This study sought to estimate the prevalence of PM and CT single and co-infections in pregnant women by using various specimens including plasma and placental tissues. Genomic DNA extracted from the placenta, cord blood or blood of mothers was tested by PCR. Conventional method of immunodiagnosis was done for CT. We tested 79 pregnant women aged 18-42 years (mean: 28±1.06). Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection determined by PCR on mother's peripheral blood specimen was 6.3% whiles 57.3% was recorded for placental tissues (p<0.01). PCR testing for placental tissues showed 29.2% positive for Toxoplasma gondii, whiles 76.0% of mothers had serum IgG against T. gondii. It should be noted that 6.3% of the placental tissues showed PCR positive for SAG 3, a marker of active infection in T. gondii. Although there were no enhanced foetal disorders at birth in our study, there is a possibility of active transmission of T. gondii from mothers to foetuses even in immune mothers. Our study suggests that foetuses were exposed to P. falciparum and T. gondii in utero, and placenta is a better specimen for PCR in detecting such episodes. In cases of PCR-positive samples, clinical follow-up after birth may be important."

Severe anemia may lead to nonimmune hydrops or fetal demise. In the case reported, the demise of one twin was diagnosed by ultrasonography in an asymptomatic 21-year-old para 1-0-2-1 African American at the gestational age of 25 weeks. The deceased twin (A) was grossly hydropic with anasarca, ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions, and a thickened placenta. Parvovirus B19 DNA was found in the amniotic fluid of Twin A using the polymerase chain-reaction technique. Serial scans of Twin B showed normal growth and no evidence of hydrops. The pregnancy was managed expectantly until 29 weeks when delivery was indicated by maternal disseminated intravascular coagulation. Maternal IgM antiparvovirus B19 antibodies were detected at the time of delivery. Antiparvovirus B19 IgM antibodies were not present in Twin B.

The complete genome of HPV199 is 7,184 bp in length with a GC content of 36.5%. Comparative genomic characterization of HPV199 and its closest relatives showed the classical genomic organization of Gammapapillomaviruses (Gamma-PVs). HPV199 has seven major open reading frames (ORFs), encoding five early (E1, E2, E4, E6, and E7) and two late (L1 and L2) proteins, while lacking the E5 ORF. The long control region (LCR) of 513 bp is located between the L1 and E6 ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis additionally confirmed that HPV-199 clusters into the Gamma-PV genus, species Gamma-12, additionally containing HPV127, HV132, HPV148, HPV165, and three putative HPV types: KC5, CG2 and CG3. HPV199 is most closely related to HPV127 (nucleotide identity 77%). The complete viral genome sequence of additional HPV199 isolate was determined from anal canal swab sample. Two HPV199 complete viral sequences exhibit 99.4% nucleotide identity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first member of Gamma-PV with complete nucleotide sequences determined from two independent clinical samples. To evaluate the tissue tropism of the novel HPV type, 916 clinical samples were tested using HPV199 type-specific real-time PCR: HPV199 was detected in 2/76 tissue samples of histologically confirmed common warts, 2/108 samples of eyebrow hair follicles, 2/137 anal canal swabs obtained from individuals with clinically evident anal pathology, 4/184 nasopharyngeal swabs and 3/411 cervical swabs obtained from women with normal cervical cytology. Although HPV199 was found in 1.4% of cutaneous and mucosal samples only, it exhibits dual tissue tropism. According to the results of our study and literature data, dual tropism of all Gamma-12 members is highly possible."

The present study examines the detection rates of TTV DNA in the serum of pregnant Japanese women and in cord blood at the time of delivery, as well as in the saliva and breast milk of mothers one-month postpartum. Primers derived from the well-known translated region N22 (N22 system), as well as the untranslated region (UTR system) were used. The prevalence of TTV DNA in the serum of pregnant women was found to be 11.9% (19/160) using the N22 system and 72.4% (55/76) using the UTR system. No TTV DNA was detected in the cord blood samples (0/160) when the N22 system was used for detection but TTV DNA was detected in 11.8% (7/76) of samples studied with the UTR system. Using the N22 system, TTV DNA was not detected in breast milk, but was detected in saliva. However using the UTR system, TTV DNA was detected in both specimens. These results imply that some babies are vertically infected with TTV via cord blood at the time of delivery or via breast milk or saliva.

CD011926,0,8396606,0,In vitro HPV-11 infection of human foreskin.,"Study of the infectious process of human papillomavirus type 11 (HPV-11) has been facilitated by the discovery that HPV-11-infected neonatal human foreskin epithelium can proliferate as xenografts into condyloma-like growths within athymic nude mice. Here we describe detection of HPV-11 infection of neonatal human foreskin-derived keratinocytes, infected and cultured entirely in vitro, by use of the polymerase chain reaction and primers straddling the splice donor/acceptor site of the most prevalent early gene HPV-11 transcript (E1 increase E4). Expression of the E1 increase E4 HPV-11 mRNA is abrogated by 60 degrees C heat inactivation of the inoculum. HPV-11-infected foreskin explants continue to produce the E1 increase E4 mRNA for up to 5 weeks in culture, and second-passage keratinocytes derived from infected explant outgrowths continue to produce the E1 increase E4 mRNA. The in vitro system described here provides a new way to study HPV-11 infection and may be useful in evaluating early events of infection."

CD011926,0,9675394,0,[Virological diagnosis of HIV infection in children].,"The laboratory diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in newborns should be carried out using virological methods, viral isolation or molecular methods for the detection of proviral DNA by PCR. Serological methods have poor sensitivity in the first months of life because the IgG of the seropositive mother crosses the placenta. Once HIV-1 infection is diagnosed, other assays are available which indicate the clinical progression of the infection, the genetic variability of the virus, its biological behavior and sensitivity to different antiretroviral medications. These studies can be used independently of the clinical manifestations in order to assess disease progression. Different immunological markers and virological markers of disease progression have been described, but the CD4+ T lymphocyte count is used routinely as an immunological marker and as a virological marker of the virus load. In HIV-1 newborns and children, the largest decrease in the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes is due to the combined effect of infection progression and a natural decrease in CD4+ T lymphocytes with age. In newborns, low viral load levels suggest that the infection was acquired shortly before birth or that maternal and/or placental factors inhibited viral replication before birth, or that the child was infected at birth. In children, viral loads are greater than in adult patients during the primary infection and throughout their evolution. Because of advances in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, the study of resistance to antiretroviral agents by phenotypical and genotypical methods is important. Increased viral load suggests the loss of effectiveness of a treatment and should be monitored."

In this study conducted in the Forecariah mangrove focus in Guinea, HAT patients and serological suspects (SERO) were identified through mass screening of the population with the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT) and were followed up for up to 2 years. Analysis of the samples collected during the follow-up of HAT patients and SERO was performed with PCR (TBR1/TBR2) and the trypanolysis serological test (TL) in order to clarify the role played by these individuals in the epidemiology of HAT. PCR positivity was higher in TL⁺ than in SERO TL⁻ (50% vs. 18%, respectively). Whereas CATT plasma titres decreased both in treated HAT patients and SERO TL⁻, SERO TL⁺ maintained high CATT titres. Four out of 17 SERO TL⁺ developed HAT during the study. These results strongly suggest that SERO TL⁺ individuals are asymptomatic carriers. In the context where disease prevalence is sufficiently low, treating SERO TL⁺ individual may thus be of crucial importance in order to cut transmission."

However, a clear causal association between HBoV-1 and gastroenteritis has not been demonstrated. In this study, we describe the detection and quantification of HBoV-1 in stools from children with acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HBoV-1 genome was detected in 10.6% of stools with frequent association with rotavirus and norovirus. The median of HBoV-1 viral load was 1.88 × 104 genome/ml, lower than previously shown in secretions of patients with respiratory infections, without any obvious association between high viral load and presence of HBoV as single agent. Thus, although HBoV-1 was frequently detected in these patients, there is no clear causal association of this agent with diarrhoea. Indeed, HBoV-1 DNA in stools of patients with gastroenteritis without respiratory symptoms may be a remnant of previous infections or associated with prolonged shedding of virus in the respiratory or digestive tracts."

CD011926,0,23089128,0,[Measles in France].,"Measles is one of the most contagious diseases implicated in an outbreak in Western Europe for a few years. In France, the outbreak began in 2008, especially in the southern regions. Most of the cases are mild but deleterious effects can occur in infants, during the pregnancy, or in immunosuppressive patients. Pneumonia and encephalitis are the major complications in these patients. Measles illness during pregnancy results in a higher risk of premature labor, spontaneous abortion, and low-birthweight infants. Death from measles was reported in approximately 0.3% of cases. The National Reference Center for measles and paramyxoviridae is implicated in biological confirmation of cases and epidemiologic surveillance. Virologic diagnosis consists in a direct detection of viral RNA (real time PCR), or indirect detection of the immune response (IgM and IgG) in saliva samples. The measles genotype is determined by sequencing a 450 nucleotids fragment of the N gene, as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation. This molecular analysis helps determine the geographic origin of the virus and the viral strains circulating in the country. In 2011, 3105 specimens were received. PCR was positive for 1990 patients (64%), with a large majority of children younger than 2 years of age and young adults. The most important cause of measles resurgence is low vaccination coverage. The role of pediatricians is important in order to achieve the goal of 95% of vaccination coverage established by the WHO."
CD011926,0,18929796,0,Quantitative Epstein-Barr virus viral load monitoring in pediatric liver transplantation.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether the implementation of the quantitative Epstein-Barr virus polymerase chain reaction (qEBV-PCR) test in 2003 decreased the incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) and PTLD-related mortality. Of the 128 children who underwent liver transplantation between January 1994 and May 2007, 110 (85.9%) survived. Patients were divided into pre (1994 to 2002; n = 86) and post (2003 to 2007; n = 42) EBV-PCR groups. There were no between-group differences in mean age, percentage of patients < 12 months old, or seronegative for EBV. The incidence rates of primary EBV infection in the pre- and post-EBV-PCR groups were 14.0% and 33.3%, respectively (P < .05). In contrast, the pre- and post-EBV-PCR groups showed similar incidences of symptomatic EBV infection (31.3% vs 35.7%; P = .625) and PTLD (10.5% vs 9.5%; P = .869), but different survival rates (80.2% vs 97.6%; P < .001). Five of nine PTLD patients in the pre-EBV-PCR group died of PTLD, but there was no PTLD-related mortality in the post-EBV-PCR group, indicating that PTLD-related mortality decreased after qEBV-PCR monitoring. These findings suggested that frequent EBV viral load monitoring and subsequent modulation of immunosuppression can reduce PTLD and PTLD-related mortality among pediatric liver transplant patients."

SK38/39 and SK145/150 were the most sensitive primer pairs, respectively detecting HIV DNA in 95.6 and 95.9% of peripheral blood mononuclear cell specimens from HIV-infected children and collectively detecting all adequately tested PCR-positive specimens. Primer pairs SK29/30 and SK68/69 respectively detected HIV DNA in only 76.4 and 76.6% of HIV-positive specimens. Among infants born to HIV-seropositive mothers, 30 who subsequently were confirmed to be infected were sampled when they were less than or equal to 6 months of age; in all but one infant, HIV DNA was found in the first specimen collected. Among the nine youngest infected infants tested, all were PCR positive by 38 days of age. PCR methods thus have reliably detected vertically transmitted HIV infection early in life."

Informative band arrays were obtained with three 10-mer primers with G+C contents of 50, 60, and 70%. Based on the combination of the band profiles generated by the three primers 22 RAPD types were detected, and 5 major clonal clusters, each one with at least 80% identical bands, were established. The clonal clusters corresponded to strains having the same serotype which, in most cases, also had the same virulence factors (colonization factors and toxin types) and outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles. The results suggested a correlation between phenotypic properties and genetic relatedness of ETEC isolates of human origin and indicated that a reduced number of clonally related strains are found in areas of ETEC endemicity in Brazil. Moreover, the RAPD technique revealed intraserotype-specific variations, undetectable by the combination of several phenotypic typing methods, among the ETEC strains analyzed. These results show that RAPD typing represents a useful tool for population genetics as well as for epidemiological studies of ETEC."

They can cause infections in patients hospitalized for a long time or who have received multiple antibiotic therapy. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are the most common species in human infections. To evaluate the possibility of rapid detection of these species and their occurrence in the blood of newborns with suspected nosocomial infection, blood samples were collected from 50 newborns with late infections, admitted to the Neonatal Care Unit of the University Hospital Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS-HU), from September 2010 to January 2011. The samples were subjected to conventional PCR and real time PCR (qPCR) to search for Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. The PCR results were compared with respective blood cultures from 40 patients. No blood cultures were positive for Enterococci, however, eight blood samples were identified as genomic DNA of Enterococcus faecium by qPCR and 22 blood samples were detected as genomic DNA of Enterococcus faecalis by conventional PCR. These findings are important because of the clinical severity of the evaluated patients who were found positive by conventional PCR and not through routine microbiological methods."

An HIV-1 DNA PCR assay with simple specimen collection and processing was developed and evaluated. Whole blood was collected on filter paper that lysed cells and bound the DNA, eliminating specimen centrifugation and extraction procedures. The DNA remained bound to the filter paper during PCR amplification. Assays of copy number standards showed reproducible detection of 5 to 10 copies of HIV-1 in 5 microl of whole blood. The sensitivity of the assay did not decrease after storage of the standards on filter paper for 3 months at room temperature or after incubation at 37 or 45 degrees C for 20 h. The primers used for nested PCR of the HIV-1 pol gene amplified templates from a reference panel of multiple HIV-1 subtypes but did not amplify a subtype A or a subtype C virus from children living in Seattle. The assay had a sensitivity of 98.4% and a specificity of 98.3% for testing of 122 specimens from 35 HIV-1-infected and 16 uninfected children and 43 seronegative adults living in Washington. The assay had a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 100% for testing of 102 HIV-1-positive (as determined by enzyme immunoassay) Peruvian women and 6 seropositive and 34 seronegative infants. This assay, with adsorption of whole blood to filter paper and no specimen processing, provides a practical, economical, sensitive, and specific method for the diagnosis of HIV-1 subtype B infection in infants."

Various species of dermatophytes show significant differences in susceptibility to antifungals. Here, we present the antifungal susceptibility of a large collection of molecularly identified dermatophyte isolates obtained from tropical region of south of Iran. A total of 9485 patients clinically suspected to have cutaneous fungal infections were examined. Dermatophytosis was confirmed in 1502 cases by direct microscopy and culture. Three hundred and sixteen isolates recovered in culture were identified to species level using PCR sequencing of ITS region and RFLP. Tinea corporis was the most prevalent type of clinical manifestation (35.2 %), followed by tinea cruris (17 %), tinea capitis (12.8 %), tinea pedis (11.3 %), tinea manuum (11 %), tinea unguium (6.9 %), and tinea barbae (5.8 %). Trichophyton interdigitale was the most common isolate (49.36 %), followed by Trichophyton rubrum (18.98 %), Epidermophyton floccosum (13.29 %), Microsporum canis (9.17 %), Arthroderma benhamiae (T. anamorph of A. benhamiae; 5.38 %), and Trichophyton tonsurans (3.79 %). Overall, irrespective of the geographical region, terbinafine was the most potent antifungal against all isolates, with an MIC range of 0.002-0.25 μg/mL, followed by itraconazole (0.004-0.5 μg/mL), griseofulvin (0.125-8 μg/mL), and fluconazole (4-128 μg/mL). Analysis of our data revealed a significant increase in the frequency of A.benhamiae, which definitely warrants further investigation to explore source of this infection in south of Iran. Moreover, terbinafine was the most effective antifungal against all isolates, in vitro."

CD011926,0,20572081,0,Adenovirus genome in the placenta: association with histological chorioamnionitis and preterm birth.,"Adenovirus is isolated frequently from the amniotic fluid and has been implicated in severe neonatal infections. A case control study was carried out to examine the association of detection of adenovirus in placentas with preterm birth and histological chorioamnionitis. Placentas from preterm and full term deliveries were collected prospectively. Preterm cases were divided into three subgroups according to the gestational age. PCR was carried out on placental tissues for the detection of adenovirus genome. Placentas were evaluated histologically for the presence of chorioamnionitis. Chi-square and odds ratios (OR) were used to determine if detection of adenovirus is associated with preterm birth and histological evidence of inflammation. Seventy-one preterm and 122 full term placentas were studied. Adenovirus genome was detected in 29 (40.8%) of preterm cases and in 25 (20.5%) of the full term controls (OR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4-5.1; P = 0.002). Detection of adenovirus in preterm placentas was significantly higher compared to full term particularly in the lower gestational age. Detection of adenovirus in placenta followed the seasonal variation of adenovirus infections. Thirty-seven preterm and 21 full term placentas were also selected for paraffin inclusion and histological examination. Chorioamnionitis was present more frequently in preterm adenovirus-positive placentas compared to preterm adenovirus-negative placentas (75% vs. 36%; P = 0.026) as well as compared to term adenovirus-positive placentas (75% vs. 19%; P = 0.003). This study demonstrates that adenovirus infection of the placenta is associated strongly with histological chorioamnionitis and preterm birth."

CD011926,0,15929697,0,Effect of CCR2 chemokine receptor polymorphism on HIV type 1 mother-to-child transmission and child survival in Western Kenya.,"The effect of CCR2 polymorphism on HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission and disease progression has not been explored in depth within Africa. As the CCR2-64I variant of this putative HIV coreceptor has been associated with slower progression to AIDS in adults, the current study was undertaken to examine the relationship between CCR2 polymorphism and HIV-1 perinatal transmission and child survival in western Kenya. CCR2 genotype was determined for 445 HIV-seropositive mothers and their infants. The CCR2-64I allele frequency of both mothers and children did not differ by HIV-1 transmission status, regardless of maternal viral load, viral subtype, immune status, or placental malaria status. For infants who acquired HIV perinatally (n = 78), there was no association between CCR2 genotype and viral load upon infection or survival rate over the 2-year follow-up. Our results do not indicate an effect of CCR2-64I on perinatal HIV transmission and survival in Kenyan children."
CD011926,0,7995957,0,HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in the first year of life.,"HIV-1-specific CTL responses were prospectively evaluated in infants born to HIV-1-seropositive women to assess the capability of the young infant to generate HIV-1-specific CTL and to examine the potential role of HIV-1-specific CTL in the pathogenesis of vertical infection. Our results indicate that some young infants, and even the fetus, seem to be capable of generating virus-specific CTL responses. The detection of HIV-1-specific CTL responses varied among infants, however, with respect to timing, HIV-1 gene product recognition, and the magnitude of detectable responses; HIV-1-specific CTL responses were uncommonly detected in the first few months of life. The less consistent detection of HIV-specific CTL in early infancy contrasts with reports of the detection of HIV-1-specific CTL soon after primary infection in adults. HIV-1-specific CTL were not detected in any uninfected infants born to HIV-1-seropositive women. This description of HIV-1-specific CTL in infants may have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of vertical HIV-1 infection and for the development of a vaccine to interrupt vertical infection."

We developed a simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for hMPV serological testing using the nucleoprotein (N) from group A or B (N-A or N-B) as the antigen, and we evaluated it in both children and adults. The N proteins were first used in a Western immunoblot assay to identify hMPV-negative sera, which were then used to determine the cutoff value of the ELISA test. Subsequent evaluation of the ELISA-N test revealed that the mean reciprocal antibody titer of 20 randomly selected seropositive children was 143, compared to 69 for 20 seropositive adults. In a prospective evaluation of 71 adults with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 58 (81.6%) had prior hMPV antibodies and 3 (4.2%) had evidence of recent hMPV infection. In testing paired sera from adults (n = 4) with recent hMPV group A infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), ELISAs using the N-A or N-B proteins were able to detect hMPV seroconversion. Moreover, testing of paired sera from three adults with a recent infection by the human respiratory syncytial virus confirmed by RT-PCR and serology did not reveal any increase in hMPV antibodies over time. The ELISA-N is a simple, objective, and specific serological test useful for detecting anti-hMPV antibodies following group A or B viral infections, which should permit a better understanding of the epidemiology of this virus."
CD011926,0,15681481,1,Use of pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA fragments to differentiate between bacteria responsible for neonatal sepsis.,"Infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units for suspicion of bacterial sepsis receive at least two broad-spectrum antibiotics for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours to cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms while awaiting blood culture results. On average, bacterial growth becomes detectable within 12 to 24 hours, with an additional 24 to 48 hours required for identification. We have previously described using a 16S rRNA PCR assay for screening neonatal blood for bacterial DNA. Combining PCR with DNA sequencing could prove a faster means of detecting bacteria than culture-based identification. If successful, antibiotic therapy could be appropriately tailored sooner, thus sparing infants the administration of unnecessary antibiotics. Our goal was to assess the potential of pyrosequencing to differentiate between bacteria commonly associated with neonatal sepsis. To begin, full-length sequencing of the 380-bp 16S rRNA amplicons from representative bacteria was conducted (ABI 3100) and several databases queried. These included Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Listeria sp., and numerous gram-negative rods. The sequences from clinical isolates were identical to those present in the published databases for the same bacteria. As a result, an informative 15 bases within the 380-bp amplicon was targeted for pyrosequencing following enrichment culture and PCR amplification. A total of 643 bacterial isolates commonly associated with neonatal sepsis, and 15 PCR-positive, culture-positive neonatal whole blood samples were analyzed by pyrosequencing. Results of DNA sequencing and culture identification were compared. In summary, we were successful at using PCR and pyrosequencing together to accurately differentiate between highly diverse bacterial groups."

Sequencing of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer 1 (IGS1) is currently mandatory for accurate Trichosporon identification, but it is not usually performed in routine laboratories. Here we describe Trichosporon species distribution and prevalence of Trichosporon asahii genotypes based on rDNA IGS1 sequencing as well as antifungal susceptibility profiles of 22 isolates recovered from blood cultures. The clinical isolates were identified as follows: 15 T. asahii isolates, five Trichosporon asteroides isolates, one Trichosporon coremiiforme isolate, and one Trichosporon dermatis isolate. We found a great diversity of different species causing trichosporonemia, including a high frequency of isolation of T. asteroides from blood cultures that is lower than that of T. asahii only. Regarding T. asahii genotyping, we found that the majority of our isolates belonged to genotype 1 (86.7%). We report the first T. asahii isolate belonging to genotype 4 in South America. Almost 50% of all T. asahii isolates exhibited amphotericin B MICs of >or=2 microg/ml. Caspofungin MICs obtained for all the Trichosporon sp. isolates tested were consistently high (MICs >or= 2 microg/ml).

CD011926,0,9665961,0,Lack of maternal antibodies to P serotypes may predispose neonates to infections with unusual rotavirus strains.,"Rotavirus (RV) strains infecting newborns often have unique neutralization antigens (P serotypes) on their outer capsids that are distinct from those found on RV strains that cause diarrhea in older children. We examined the hypothesis that unusual RV strains preferentially infect newborns because the newborns lack maternal neutralizing antibodies to these strains. To test this hypothesis, sera and saliva samples collected from neonates infected with 116E-like (P[11]G9) strains in the maternity ward of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) hospital in New Delhi were tested for neutralizing antibodies against common RV strains and those infecting newborns and these titers were compared with those of newborns who did not become infected (controls). The infected neonates had significantly lower levels of cord blood neutralizing antibodies to 116E than the controls, suggesting that immunity to neonatal RV infection is acquired transplacentally through maternal antibodies. Further, this study confirmed the immunogenicity of the AIIMS neonatal strain 116E, a vaccine candidate, in its ability to evoke a potent RV-specific immunoglobulin A and neutralizing antibody response in serum and saliva among the infected babies. Our findings have important implications for the development of an effective RV vaccine. In India, where G9 strains are common in the community, the use of 116E as a vaccine, together with the rhesus tetravalent vaccine, may provide a broader protection against all the circulating RV serotypes, including serotype G9, which is not represented in the current rhesus RV tetravalent vaccine (G1-G4)."
CD011926,0,16010158,0,Signal-boosted qualitative ultrasensitive p24 antigen assay for diagnosis of subtype C HIV-1 infection in infants under the age of 2 years.,"The gold standard for diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants under the age of 2 years is DNA or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. However, these tests are expensive and therefore not available in resource-limited countries. With the increasing availability of antiretroviral drugs for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and treatment of AIDS in resource-poor countries, there is an urgent need to develop cheaper, alternative, and cost-effective laboratory methods for early diagnosis of infant HIV-1 infection that will be useful in identifying infected infants who may benefit from early cotrimoxazole prophylaxis or commencement of antiretroviral therapy. We evaluated an alternative method, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based qualitative ultrasensitive p24 antigen assay for diagnosis of subtype C HIV-1 infection in infants under the age of 2 years using DNA polymerase chain reaction as the reference method. The assay showed a sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI: 93.0-100) for detection of HIV-1 infection among infants 0-18 months of age with a specificity of 96.1% (95% CI: 91.7-100).

With sera from 269 British children aged 0 to 179 weeks, the tests showed that most (10 of 98 serum samples [13%]) HHV-6 low-avidity antibody was found in the first year of life, whereas for HHV-7, most (18 of 101 serum samples [20%]) HHV-7 low-avidity antibody was found in the second year of life. Five children had low-avidity antibodies to both viruses. Of nine Japanese children with previously serologically proven primary HHV-6 or HHV-7 infections, eight had low-avidity antibody only to the relevant virus, but one child had low-avidity antibodies to HHV-6 and HHV-7. The avidity tests were applied to five British children and further proof of viral infection was sought by the detection of specific DNA in serum or plasma, and saliva or cerebrospinal fluid. In two children who had low-avidity antibody to HHV-7 but who were seronegative for HHV-6, only HHV-7 was found. Both viruses were detected in one child with low-avidity HHV-7 antibody and high-avidity HHV-6 antibody.

CD011926,0,24281871,0,Human keratinocyte cultures in the investigation of early steps of human papillomavirus infection.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are non-enveloped DNA viruses that are highly tropic for mucosal and cutaneous epithelia. The HPV life cycle is tightly linked to epithelial cell differentiation, where HPVs only infect the basal proliferating keratinocytes, and progeny virus assembly and release only occurs in differentiated upper-layer keratinocytes. Therefore, human keratinocyte monolayer cultures provide a useful model to study the early stages of HPV infection. However, previous reports have shown some conflicting results of virus-host interactions during HPV entry, which may be partly attributable to the different cell culture models used to examine these steps of HPV infection. Thus, there is a need to have a standardized in vitro model system to study virus-host interactions during HPV entry. Here, we describe the three most widely accepted keratinocyte models for studying HPV infection: primary human foreskin keratinocytes, normal immortalized keratinocytes, and transformed HaCaT keratinocytes. We also describe methods to genetically manipulate these cells, enabling the study of candidate host genes that may be important during HPV infection. Lastly, we outline simple and robust methods to assay HPV infectivity, which can be used to determine whether knockdown or overexpression of a particular gene affects HPV entry."
CD011926,0,8102374,0,Comparison of two molecular methods for tracing nosocomial transmission of Escherichia coli K1 in a neonatal unit.,"Escherichia coli K1, a normal inhabitant of the human flora, is also an important cause of serious infections in newborns. We compared two molecular methods, ribotyping and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR), to study the apparent nosocomial transmission of an E. coli K1 clone in a nursery for premature neonates. Sixty-two E. coli K1 strains isolated from 41 premature neonates from December 1991 to June 1992 and six strains isolated from ambient sources were studied. Eight E. coli K1 strains isolated from infants in the nursery between 1989 and September 1991 were included as controls. The properties of the strains isolated between December 1991 and June 1992 were as follows: 43 belonged to ribotype I, 12 belonged to ribotype III, and the remaining 13 isolates were distributed among 10 ribotypes. The eight control strains belonged to seven different ribotypes, but none was ribotype I. Between December 1991 and February 1992, the majority of strains from premature infants colonized with E. coli K1 were of ribotype I. Isolates from the ventilation system and from a storage shelf were also of ribotype I. When DNA from 56 selected strains was tested by AP-PCR by using the 5'-TTGTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3' oligonucleotide, 15 different profiles were obtained. Twenty-five of 56 strains were of ribotype I and had identical profiles by AP-PCR. Strains with ribotypes VI, VII, and X to XV had different profiles by AP-PCR. We conclude that ribotyping and AP-PCR correlate well and permit demonstration of the nosocomial dissemination of E. coli K1 in a unit for premature neonates."
CD011926,0,8629942,0,Detection of proviral human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I DNA in mouthwash samples of HAM/TSP patients and HTLV-I carriers.,"Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I), is a member of the oncogenic retroviruses family endemic in several parts of the world and also recently identified in the Jewish Mashhadi population who immigrated from Iran to Israel. The virus is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and a chronic myelopathy known both as tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) or HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM). The known modes of HTLV-I transmission are by sexual intercourse, from mother to child in breast milk, via blood transfusion, and by sharing of needles by parenteral drug users. In the present study we examined the presence of HTLV-I provirus genomic DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by DNA hybridization in mouthwash samples obtained from 13 Mashhadi-born Iranian Jews with spastic paraparesis associated with HTLV-I, 4 Mashhadi-born Iranian Jews asymptomatic carriers for HTLV-I and 21 healthy controls. Proviral HTLV-I DNA was detected by mouthwash PCR in 12 of 17 HTLV-I infected subjects (71%) but in none of 21 controls. Proviral DNA was also detected in mouthwash samples using HTLV-I probe by dot blot hybridization assay. The presence of HTLV-I proviral DNA in whole saliva may suggest a possible transmission of the virus via saliva and explain the increased rate of infection in elderly Mashhadi-Jewish population."

Also a RT-qPCR assay for detection of HPeV RNA in different clinical samples was developed and evaluated. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 232 patients suspected for meningitis was collected and tested for EV and HPeV using RT-qPCR assays. In parallel an aliquot of the samples was tested using the GXEA and viral culture. EV RNA was detected in 22 (19.0%) and 28 (24.1%) of 116 samples using the GXEA and RT-qPCR assay, respectively.

Group A rotavirus was detected in 71 of 251 (28.3%) specimens: 55 (77.5%) from children under 5 years of age and 16 (22.5%) from individuals aged 6-72 years. All 71 strains exhibited a ""long"" RNA pattern when analyzed by PAGE. Sixty-one positive samples that yielded enough RNA were submitted to PCR genotyping. The most frequent G/P genotype combination detected was G1P[8] (86.9%; 53/61) followed by G9P[8] (3.3%; 2/61) and G12P[9] (1.6%; 1/61). Rotaviruses with G2, G3, G4, P[4], or P[6] specificity were not detected. For three strains (4.9%) bearing G1 genotype, the VP4 specificity could no be determined, and two specimens (3.3%) remained G/P non-typeable. One rotavirus strain (HC91) bearing G12P[9] genotype with a ""long"" electropherotype was isolated from an 11-month-old boy with diarrhea for the first time in Brazil. The cell-culture grown HC91 strain was shown to belong to serotype G12 by neutralization."
CD011926,0,19091813,1,Utility of pyrosequencing in identifying bacteria directly from positive blood culture bottles.,"Growth in liquid media is the gold standard for detecting microorganisms associated with bloodstream infections. The Gram stain provides the first clue as to the etiology of infection, with phenotypic identification completed 1 or 2 days later. Providing more detailed information than the Gram stain can impart, and in less time than subculturing, would allow the use of more directed empirical therapy and, thus, reduce the patient's exposure to unnecessary or ineffective antibiotics sooner. The study had two objectives, as follows: (i) to identify new targets to improve our ability to differentiate among certain enteric gram-negative rods or among certain Streptococcus species and (ii) to determine whether real-time PCR and pyrosequencing could as accurately identify organisms directly from positive blood culture bottles as culture-based methods. Two hundred and fifty-five consecutive positive blood culture bottles were included. The results showed a high level of agreement between the two approaches; of the 270 bacteria isolated from the 255 blood culture bottles, results for pyrosequencing and culture-based identifications were concordant for 264/270 (97.8%) bacteria with three failed sequences, and three sequences without match. Additionally, compared to the universal 16S rRNA gene target, the new 23S rRNA gene targets greatly improved our ability to differentiate among certain enteric gram-negative rods or among certain Streptococcus species. In conclusion, combining real-time PCR and pyrosequencing provided valuable information beyond that derived from the initial Gram stain and in less time than phenotypic culture-based identification. This strategy, if implemented, could result in a more directed empirical therapy in patients and would promote responsible antibiotic stewardship."

CD011926,0,26686998,0,High predicted strain coverage by the multicomponent meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) in Poland.,"Neisseria meningitidis of serogroup B (MenB) is currently responsible for more than 70% of cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Poland and Europe as a whole. The aim of this study was to estimate strain coverage of a multicomponent meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) in Poland; the meningococcal antigen typing system (MATS) was used to test a panel of 196 invasive MenB strains isolated in Poland in 2010 and 2011. The strains were also characterized by MLST and sequencing of porA, factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial heparin-binding antigen (nhba) and Neisserial adhesin A (nadA) genes. MATS and molecular data were analyzed independently and in combination. The MATS results predicted that 83.7% (95% CI: 78.6-91.0%) of isolates would be covered by the 4CMenB vaccine; 59.2% by one vaccine antigen, 19.9% by two and 4.6% by three antigens. Coverage by each antigen was as follows: fHbp 73.0% (95% CI: 68.9-77.5%), NHBA 28.6% (95% CI: 13.3-47.4%), NadA 1.0% (95% CI: 1.0-2.0%) and PorA 10.2%. Molecular analysis revealed that the most frequent clonal complexes (ccs) were cc32 (33.2%), cc18 (17.9%) and cc41/44 (15.8%) with estimated coverage of 98.5%, 88.6% and 93.5%, respectively. Consistent with findings for other European countries, our study predicts high coverage by the 4CMenB vaccine in Poland."
CD011926,0,14723355,0,Hepatitis B virus DNA during pregnancy and post partum: aspects on vertical transmission.,"Little is known about how pregnancy influences viremia levels in women with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In this study, we first retrospectively analysed changes in HBV DNA levels during and after 55 pregnancies in HBsAg-positive women, of whom 9 were HBeAg-positive. Secondly, HBV DNA levels in 3 HBeAg-positive mothers whose babies became chronic HBV carriers, were compared with levels in 18 mothers whose babies were not infected by HBV. We found that HBV DNA ranged from 10(8.1) to 10(9.5) copies/mL in HBeAg-positive, and from undetectable (< 100) to 10(6.8) copies/mL in HBeAg-negative mothers. HBV DNA increased by a mean of 0.4 log late in pregnancy or early post partum; in 4 out of 16 HBeAg negative mothers by > 1 log during pregnancy. Post partum ALT increased in both HBeAg-positive and negative women. HBV DNA was 10(9.4)-10(10.4) copies/mL in 3 HBeAg-positive mothers whose babies were, as compared to < 100-10(10.4) copies/mL in 18 whose babies were not, vertically infected. Although the majority of HBeAg-negative women had low and relatively stable HBV DNA during pregnancy, viremia was also relatively high in some HBeAg-negative mothers, and both viremia and ALT increased significantly late in pregnancy or shortly after delivery. Vertical transmission was only seen in HBeAg-positive mothers with very high levels of viremia. The value of measuring HBV DNA in the pregnant woman to modify immunoprophylaxis to her infant needs further study."

CD011926,0,26238862,0,16S rDNA PCR-DGGE and sequencing in the diagnosis of neonatal late-onset septicemia.,"The 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing method has been demonstrated to be valuable in detecting pathogens in the blood of patients suffering from fever or neutropenia. However, its use in the diagnosis of neonatal late‑onset septicemia (LOS) has not yet been reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficiency of this method in detection of the type of bacterial infection in neonatal LOS. Blood specimens from 60 neonates in whom LOS was suspected were collected. Fourteen culture positive blood samples and 24 spiked 'infected' blood samples were analyzed by the 16S rDNA PCR‑DGGE and sequencing method or by pathogen‑specific PCR. Only in 5 of the 14 cases did the results of 16S rDNA PCR‑DGGE and sequencing match with the results of blood culturing. In the other 9 cases, the blood culture failed to detect bacteria, such as Neisseria sp. and Moraxella sp., which were detected by 16S rDNA PCR‑DGGE and sequencing. Furthermore, the 16S rDNA PCR‑DGGE and sequencing failed to detect blood culture‑proven bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumonia. A competitive inhibitory effect in 16S rDNA PCR amplification may lead to the discrepancy between pathogen‑specific PCR and spiked 'infected' blood samples. When a certain species of bacteria was detected by 16S rDNA PCR, the competitive inhibitory effect presented a higher sensitivity in detecting this species in the blood samples that contained bacterial DNA only from this species compared with the blood samples that were blended with other bacterial DNAs. In conclusion, 16S rDNA PCR‑DGGE and sequencing can detect a more comprehensive spectrum of pathogens than blood culture. However, the competitive inhibitory effect, which may lead to false negative results should be taken into consideration when the 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE and sequencing method is applied to the diagnosis of neonatal LOS."

CD011926,0,20623342,0,Virological investigations in sudden unexpected deaths in infancy (SUDI).,"Previous studies have implicated viral infections in the pathogenesis of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), and routine virological investigations are recommended by current SUDI autopsy protocols. The aim of this study is to determine the role of post-mortem virology in establishing a cause of death. A retrospective review of 546 SUDI autopsies was carried out as part of a larger series of >1,500 consecutive paediatric autopsies performed over a 10-year period, 1996-2005, in a single specialist centre. Virological tests were performed as part of the post-mortem examination in 490 (90%) of the 546 SUDI autopsies, comprising 4,639 individual virological tests, of which 79% were performed on lung tissue samples. Diagnostic methods included immunofluorescence assays (using a routine respiratory virus panel; 98% of cases), cell culture (61%), rapid culture techniques such as the DEAFF test for CMV (55%), PCR (13%), electron microscopy (10%), and others. Virus was identified in only 18 cases (4%), viz. five cases of enterovirus, four of RSV, three of HSV and CMV, and one each of adenovirus, influenza virus and HIV. In seven of the 18 cases the death was classified as due to viral infection, whilst of the remaining 11 cases, death was due to bacterial infection in five, a non-infective cause in one and unexplained in five. Virus was identified in 33% of deaths due to probable viral infections, but also in 6% of SUDI due to bacterial infections, and in 2% of SUDI due to known non-infective causes and unexplained SUDI. When predominantly using immunofluorescence, virus is identified in only a small proportion of SUDI autopsies, resulting in a contribution to the final cause of death in <2% of SUDI post-mortem examinations. Routine post-mortem virological analysis by means of an immunofluorescence respiratory virus panel appears to be of limited benefit in SUDI for the purposes of determining cause of death. Application of a broader panel using more sensitive detection techniques may reveal more viruses, although their contribution to the final cause of death requires further exploration."
CD011926,0,15118205,0,An epidemiological analysis of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains in a university hospital.,"The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the epidemiology of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in a university hospital of Turkey. From June 2000 to December 2001, S. maltophilia strains were collected, clinical presentations were noted, and MIC determinations were performed by means of E-test. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences-PCR (ERIC-PCR) was used for molecular typing of the strains. Forty-four strains of S. maltophilia were isolated from 41 hospitalized patients in a teaching hospital. The majority of specimens were from the blood and respiratory tract. Antimicrobial sensitivities of these strains were as follows: 97.7 % trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 15.9% ticarcillin, and 95.4% ticarcillin- clavulanate. The strains were evaluated using the ERIC-PCR method. It was of interest to note that epidemiological typing revealed three small outbreaks that were caused by a total of 12 strains. The remaining isolates generated singular DNA patterns. DNA amplification was possible in 38 isolates and yielded 26 different patterns in a period of 20 months, leading to the suggestion that commensal bacteria becomes selected in the presence of a suitable host."
CD011926,0,8473761,0,Application of the polymerase chain reaction to the diagnosis of human toxoplasmosis.,"Toxoplasmosis may cause significant damage to the developing fetus and is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised persons. Serological investigation is unreliable, while isolation of the parasite is time consuming and may lack sensitivity. We have developed a system for detecting Toxoplasma gondii based on the amplification of the P30 gene using sequential rounds of PCR and nested primers. The clinical value of this technique was assessed by the investigation of a range of tissues taken from pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, AIDS patients and organ graft recipients. The PCR assay produced more positive reactions than isolation of the parasite by means of cell culture or animal inoculation. Extended autoradiography was found to be more sensitive than stained agarose gels for detecting the PCR product. Systematic contamination of PCR reactions was avoided but it was not possible to exclude sporadic contamination in certain cases. Detection of specific DNA is of clinical value in the investigation of the pregnant woman in order to assess the risk of transplacental passage of infection and in the fetus and neonate to identify congenital toxoplasmosis. Even so, PCR findings must be interpreted with caution because of the risk of a sample being contaminated. PCR may be the investigation of choice when brain biopsy is performed on a patient with AIDS and when toxoplasmosis associated with bone marrow transplantation is suspected."

CD011926,0,18054840,0,New advances in the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus infection.,"Although the diagnosis of congenital CMV infection is still complex, important goals have been achieved in recent years, among which are: the availability of more reliable IgM tests for screening pregnant women whose pre-pregnancy serological status for CMV is unknown, tests to determine the avidity index of anti-CMV IgG, allowing the diagnosis of a primary CMV infection and innovative and traditional virological tests to detect the virus in amniotic fluid. When a woman is found to be IgM-positive, further diagnostic evaluation focused on determining whether this is due to a primary infection should be carried out. Maternal primary infections that were difficult to determine until a few years ago unless documented by seroconversions can now be readily diagnosed from the presence of low/moderate avidity anti-CMV antibody which persists for approximately 18-20 weeks after primary infection. In mothers at risk of transmitting the virus prenatal diagnosis can be performed between 21 and 22 weeks of gestation, and the amniotic fluid represents the pathological material of choice to determine intrauterine virus transmission. At birth or in the first 2/3 weeks of life, it is essential to use appropriate tests for diagnosis of CMV congenital infection."

Serological and virological tests used for evaluating the frequency of acquired infections and the prevalence of various clinical and epidemiological aspects of herpetic infections have greatly changed in the last decade: (a) specific serological tests differentiate anti HSV1 and anti HSV2 antibody, allow the precise measurement of HVS1 and HSV2 infections prevalence and demonstrate the increasing frequency of Herpes Simplex genital infections in the last decades, in most of the countries (but Japan), (b) the development of direct diagnostic tests: virus growth in cells cultures, antigens detection by immuno-fluorescence and ELISA tests, genome amplification and detection by PCR and hybridization pointed but that: (1) the asymptomatic genital HSV excretion represents a frequent risk for neonatal contamination, (2) genital HSV1 noticeably increased in frequency, its epidemiological consequences are not yet evaluated, (3) a severely compromised immune status favours the frequency, the severity and chronicity of HSV infections, and the selection of antiviral resistant strains.

Twenty-four strains were isolated from the intestinal flora, and 25 strains were isolated from the vaginas of pregnant women. Twenty-seven strains were isolated from the amniotic fluid, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infected neonates. The intraspecies genetic characteristics of all of the isolates were determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, PCR ECOR (E. coli reference) grouping, and PCR virulence genotyping. A correlation was found between the intraspecies distributions of the strains in the A, B1, B2, and D ECOR groups and in the two major RAPD groups (I and II). Nevertheless, the distribution of the E. coli strains in the RAPD groups according to their anatomical origins was more significant than their distribution in the ECOR groups. This may be explained by the existence of an E. coli subpopulation, defined by the RAPD I group, within the ECOR B2 group. This RAPD I group presents a major risk for neonates: 75% of the strains isolated from patients with meningitis and 100% of the strains isolated from patients with bacteremia were in this group. The vagina and the amniotic fluid are two barriers that favor colonization by highly infectious strains. Indeed, only 17% of fecal strains belonged to the RAPD I group, whereas 52% of vaginal strains and 67% of amniotic fluid strains belonged to this subpopulation. The ibeA and iucC genes were significantly associated with CSF strains, whereas the hly and sfa/foc genes were more frequent in blood strains. These findings could serve as a basis for developing tools to recognize vaginal strains, which present a high risk for neonates, for use in prophylaxis programs."

A total of 300 participants who had the same immunosuppressive regimen and received preemptive therapy for CMV infection were prospectively enrolled in this study; they included 289 vaccine trial participants. The gB-absorbed CMV IgG assay was performed for each vaccine trial participant. The healthy women were divided into 2 groups, and amniotic fluids were collected from them at 15-18 weeks of gestation to test for CMV seropositivity before conception by using IgM specific antibodies, CMV-DNA, and IgG analysis. In 104 cases, cord blood sera and urine specimens were also collected from the infants and examined. The sensitivity and specificity of immediate-early messenger RNA and pp67 (late) messenger RNA detection by the nucleic acid sequence-based amplification technique was comparable to those of virus isolation and PCR.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether serum trypsin levels and genotypes of cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) gene could be served as markers for predicting neonatal sepsis. The serum trypsin levels and genotypes of PRSS1 were examined in both 50 infants with infection during neonatal period and 56 healthy neonates as controls. The infected infants were further subdivided into infants with sepsis group (n=18) and infected infants without sepsis (n=32). The genotype of PRSS1 was analyzed by direct sequencing, and the serum trypsin level was measured by immunoassay. It showed that the median value of serum trypsin was significantly higher in infected infants (31.90 ng/mL) than in controls (12.85 ng/mL; P=0.030). More importantly, sepsis subgroup (50.95 ng/mL) had significantly higher median serum trypsin than infected infants without sepsis subgroup (19.10 ng/mL) and controls (12.85 ng/mL) (P=0.015 and P=0.002, respectively). Additionally, the median serum trypsin levels were found significantly higher in infants who had T/T (37.90 ng/mL) genotype of PRSS1 compared with those who had C/T genotype (12.80 ng/mL; P=0.005). This study suggested that serum trypsin and rs10273639 C/T of PRSS1 were revealed to be novel markers for predicting neonatal sepsis."
CD011926,0,12149499,0,Human adenovirus and human cytomegalovirus infections in preterm newborns: no association with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.,"Connatal infection with human adenovirus (HAdV) has been recently proposed as a cofactor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants [Couroucli et al. 2000 Pediatr Res 47:225-232]. In another study, BPD was associated with an increased incidence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection [Sawyer et al. 1987 Am J Dis Child 141:303-305]. During a 18-mo study period, we investigated tracheal aspirates or pharyngeal aspirates and urine samples collected during the first month of life from 66 preterm newborns with very low birth weight (< or =1.500 g) for replication-potent HAdV as well as for adenoviral and HCMV DNA by virus culture and qualitative DNA PCR. Thus, our study included not only prenatal but also peri- and postnatal infections. Thirty-seven percent (24/66) of infants developed BPD(1), as defined by persistent oxygen dependency at day 28 of life. Replication-potent HAdV and/or adenoviral DNA could be detected repeatedly in tracheal aspirates/pharyngeal aspirates and/or urine from 20% (13/66) of preterm infants. Seventeen percent (4/24) of infants in the BPD(1) group and 21% (9/42) of infants in the non-BPD group had an HAdV infection, indicating that in our study the very recently proposed association between HAdV infection of the lung and BPD could not be confirmed. For comparison, active HCMV infection was diagnosed in 18% (12/66) of infants, 3 of which developed HCMV disease. 29% (7/24) in the BPD(1) group and 12% (5/42) in the non-BPD group were positive for HCMV. Again, there was no statistically significant association between HCMV infection and BPD. In summary, our findings indicate that HAdV and HCMV infection are frequent in preterm newborns with very low birth weight; however, a causal association with the development of BPD seems unlikely."
CD011926,0,20509575,0,"[Significance of diagnostics and treatment in preventing congenital infections with Toxoplasma gondii (Tg), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and parvowirus B19 (PVB19)].","Common use of available techniques detecting perinatal infections needs to be accompanied with knowledge of proper interpretation of the tests and indications for treatment as well as communication with patients. The aim of this paper is to summarize current standards of diagnosis and treatment of infections in pregnant women and neonates. The detection of specific IgG antibodies in pre-conceptive period excludes the risk of transplacental Tg and PVB19 infection, while the risk of CMV infection is diminished and probable symptoms alleviated. Confirmed diagnosis of primary infection during pregnancy: 1. Toxoplasmosis (seroconversion, presence of IgA and IgM, low avidity IgG, PCR in amniotic fluid) is an indication for antimicrobial therapy; 2. Symptomatic CMV infection [seroconversion, virus detected in blood and urine (PCR, pp65 antigen)] for prophylactic IgG administration in mother; 3. PVB19 (seroconversion, IgM, PCR in blood and amniotic fluid) for frequent ultrasonographic evaluation of possible symptoms of fetal hydrops, and fetal transfusin if hydrops occurs. Diagnosis and treatment of the neonates should be managed in specialized c enters. Further monitoring of the infection is handicapped by the presence of maternal antibodies as well as the suppression of neonatal production of specific IgA and IgM. Toxoplasmosis requires from 6 (in asymptomatic infestation) to 12 months (in symptomatic infestation) treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine with supplementation of folinic acid. In symptomatic CMV infection 6 weeks treatment with ganciclovir is legitimate (decreases viruria and the risk of hearing impairment); while in asymptomatic infection with massive viral replication it can be considered as supposedly beneficial. The impact of prolonged treatment (over 6 weeks) as well as oral antiviral (valganciclovir) is currently under clinical investigation. The educational efforts should include: methods of preventing infections (Tg, CMV), necessity of repeated testing and treatment in pregnancy (Tg, PVB19), treatment of the neonate (Tg, CMV) and breastfeeding (CMV)."

CD011926,0,24478494,0,High-resolution melt PCR analysis for genotyping of Ureaplasma parvum isolates directly from clinical samples.,"Ureaplasma sp. infection in neonates and adults underlies a variety of disease pathologies. Of the two human Ureaplasma spp., Ureaplasma parvum is clinically the most common. We have developed a high-resolution melt (HRM) PCR assay for the differentiation of the four serovars of U. parvum in a single step. Currently U. parvum strains are separated into four serovars by sequencing the promoter and coding region of the multiple-banded antigen (MBA) gene. We designed primers to conserved sequences within this region for PCR amplification and HRM analysis to generate reproducible and distinct melt profiles that distinguish clonal representatives of serovars 1, 3, 6, and 14. Furthermore, our HRM PCR assay could classify DNA extracted from 74 known (MBA-sequenced) test strains with 100% accuracy. Importantly, HRM PCR was also able to identify U. parvum serovars directly from 16 clinical swabs. HRM PCR performed with DNA consisting of mixtures of combined known serovars yielded profiles that were easily distinguished from those for single-serovar controls. These profiles mirrored clinical samples that contained mixed serovars. Unfortunately, melt curve analysis software is not yet robust enough to identify the composition of mixed serovar samples, only that more than one serovar is present. HRM PCR provides a single-step, rapid, cost-effective means to differentiate the four serovars of U. parvum that did not amplify any of the known 10 serovars of Ureaplasma urealyticum tested in parallel. Choice of reaction reagents was found to be crucial to allow sufficient sensitivity to differentiate U. parvum serovars directly from clinical swabs rather than requiring cell enrichment using microbial culture techniques."

This study describes a neonatal case with meningitis in which M. hominis was isolated from a cerebrospinal fluid sample by culture and detected by PCR. The M. hominis infection was confirmed by elevated metabolic inhibition titers against the isolated M. hominis strain and anti-M. hominis antibodies in serum samples. Minocycline and moxifloxacin were effective against M. hominis, which caused meningitis in the patient. However, the patient exhibited left hemiplegia because of massive brain infarction. Based on data of the previously reported 28 cases in addition to our case, the high morbidity and mortality of the M. hominis central nervous system infection were confirmed; it was assumed to result from delayed diagnosis and ineffective initial therapy. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment are necessary for a favorable prognosis. Fourth-generation fluoroquinolones, especially moxifloxacin, deserve wider use in such cases."

Invasive practices, such as cerebral biopsy, have been replaced by obtaining a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis using cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) as a reference method. Tests on DNA extracted from plasma are noninvasive, thus avoiding all of the collateral effects and patient risks associated with CSF collection. This study aimed to determine whether plasma can replace CSF in nested PCR analysis for the detection of CNS human herpesvirus (HHV) diseases by analysing the proportion of patients whose CSF nested PCR results were positive for CNS HHV who also had the same organism identified by plasma nested PCR. In this study, CSF DNA was used as the ""gold standard,"" and nested PCR was performed on both types of samples. Fifty-two patients with symptoms of nervous system infection were submitted to CSF and blood collection. For the eight HHV, one positive DNA result-in plasma and/or CSF nested PCR-was considered an active HHV infection, whereas the occurrence of two or more HHVs in the same sample was considered a coinfection. HHV infections were positively detected in 27/52 (51.9%) of the CSF and in 32/52 (61.5%) of the plasma, difference not significant, thus nested PCR can be performed on plasma instead of CSF. In conclusion, this findings suggest that plasma as a useful material for the diagnosis of cases where there is any difficulty to perform a CSF puncture."

CD011926,0,24141968,0,Coagulase-negative staphylococci strains resistant to oxacillin isolated from neonatal blood cultures.,"Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from clinical samples and are commonly found in neonatal blood cultures. Oxacillin is an alternative treatment of choice for CoNS infections; however, resistance to oxacillin can have a substantial impact on healthcare by adversely affecting morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to detect and characterise oxacillin-resistant CoNS strains in blood cultures of newborns hospitalised at the neonatal ward of the University Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of Botucatu. One hundred CoNS strains were isolated and the mecA gene was detected in 69 of the CoNS strains, including 73.2% of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 85.7% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains, 28.6% of Staphylococcus hominis strains and 50% of Staphylococcus lugdunensis strains. Among these oxacillin-resistant CoNS strains, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type I was identified in 24.6%, type II in 4.3%, type III in 56.5% and type IV in 14.5% of the strains. The data revealed an increase in the percentage of CoNS strains isolated from blood cultures from 1991-2009. Furthermore, a predominant SCCmec profile of the oxacillin-resistant CoNS strains isolated from neonatal intensive care units was identified with a prevalence of SCCmec types found in hospital-acquired strains."
CD011926,0,22518871,0,Early diagnosis of in utero and intrapartum HIV infection in infants prior to 6 weeks of age.,"Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy reduces HIV-related infant mortality. The early peak of pediatric HIV-related deaths in South Africa occurs at 3 months of age, coinciding with the earliest age at which treatment is initiated following PCR testing at 6 weeks of age. Earlier diagnosis is necessary to reduce infant mortality. The performances of the Amplicor DNA PCR, COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan (CAP/CTM), and Aptima assays for detecting early HIV infection (acquired in utero and intrapartum) up to 6 weeks of age were compared. Dried blood spots (DBS) were collected at birth and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks from HIV-exposed infants enrolled in an observational cohort study in Johannesburg, South Africa. HIV status was determined at 6 weeks by DNA PCR on whole blood. Serial DBS samples from all HIV-infected infants and two HIV-uninfected, age-matched controls were tested with the 3 assays. Of 710 infants of known HIV status, 38 (5.4%) had in utero (n = 29) or intrapartum (n = 9) infections. By 14 weeks, when treatment should have been initiated, 13 (45%) in utero-infected and 2 (22%) intrapartum-infected infants had died or were lost to follow-up. The CAP/CTM and Aptima assays identified 76.3% of all infants with early HIV infections at birth and by 4 weeks were 96% sensitive. DNA PCR demonstrated lower sensitivities at birth and 4 weeks of 68.4% and 87.5%, respectively. All assays had the lowest sensitivity at 2 weeks of age. CAP/CTM was the only assay with 100% specificity at all ages. Testing at birth versus 6 weeks of age identifies a higher total number of HIV-infected infants, irrespective of the assay."

Metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing CRE have recently been reported in the United States among patients who received medical care in countries where such organisms are common. Here, we describe three carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from pediatric patients at a single U.S. health care facility, none of whom had a history of international travel. The isolates were resistant to carbapenems but susceptible to aztreonam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones.

In this study, we used a newly described clonal typing strategy based on sequencing of fumC and fimH (i.e., CH typing) to infer multilocus sequence types (STs) for 299 consecutive, nonduplicate extraintestinal E. coli isolates from all cultures submitted to Olmsted County, MN, laboratories in February and March 2011 and then compared STs with epidemiological data. Forty-seven different STs were identified, most commonly ST131 (27%), ST95 (11%), ST73 (8%), ST127 (6%), and ST69 (5%). Isolates from these five STs comprised two-thirds of health care-associated (HA) isolates but only half of community-associated (CA) isolates. ST131 was represented overwhelmingly (88%) by a single recently expanded H30 subclone, which was the most extensively antimicrobial-resistant subclone overall and was especially predominant in HA infections and among adults >50 years old. In contrast, among patients 11 to 50 years old, ST69, -95, and -73 were more common. Because of the preponderance of the H30 subclone of ST131, ST diversity was lower among HA than CA isolates, and among antimicrobial-resistant than antimicrobial-susceptible isolates, which otherwise had similar ST distributions. In conclusion, in this U.S. Midwest region, the distribution and diversity of STs among extraintestinal E. coli clinical isolates vary by patient age, type of infection, and resistance phenotype. ST131 predominates among young children and the elderly, HA infections, and antimicrobial-resistant isolates, whereas other well-known pathogenic lineages are more common among adolescents and young adults, CA infections, and antimicrobial-susceptible isolates."
CD011926,0,18979430,0,[Ultrasound findings in fetal infection].,"Infections acquired in utero or during the birth process are a significant cause of fetal and neonatal mortality and an important contributor to early and later childhood morbidity. Advances in ultrasound, invasive prenatal procedures and molecular diagnostics have allowed in utero evaluation and given rise to more timely and accurate diagnosis in infected fetuses. Transplacental transmission of the infectious agent, even in subclinical maternal infection, may result in a severe congenital syndrome. Prenatal detection of infection is based on fetal sonographic findings and polymerase chain reaction to identify the specific agent. Nevertheless, most affected fetuses appear sonographically normal, but serial scanning may reveal evolving findings. Sonographic fetal abnormalities may be indicative of fetal infections, although they are generally not sensitive or specific. These include growth restriction, hydrops, ventriculomegaly, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, intracranial or hepatic calcifications, ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, echogenic bowel, placentomegaly, and abnormal amniotic fluid volume. When abnormalities are detected on ultrasound, a thorough fetal evaluation is recommended because of potential multiorgan involvement. The sonologist should understand the limitations of ultrasound. Patients should be counseled that ultrasound is not a sensitive test for fetal infection and that a normal fetal anatomy survey cannot reliably predict a favorable outcome."

CD011926,0,25532506,0,Faecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli in hospital settings in southern France.,"The emergence of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli is a worldwide problem. To date, no study has evaluated the prevalence of faecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR GNB) in France. From 1 February to 30 April 2012, we conducted a prospective, multicentre study in three University Hospitals and four General Hospitals in the south of France. The carriage of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) and other CR GNB was screened by both cultivation on chromID® CARBA and chromID® OXA-48 media (bioMérieux) and molecular tools [multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and NucliSENS EasyQ® KPC (bioMérieux)]. The genetic relationship between isolates was assessed by rep-PCR (DiversiLab, bioMérieux) or multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The prevalences of CR GNB and carbapenemase-producing bacteria were 2.4 % (27/1,135) and 0.4 % (n = 5), respectively. Two strains corresponded to OXA-23-producing Acinetobacter baumannii and belonged to the widespread sequence type (ST) 2/international clone II, whereas one strain was an ST15 OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two OXA-48-producers were detected exclusively by PCR. This first French study revealed the very low dissemination of carbapenemase-producing bacteria in patients attending hospitals in southern France during a non-outbreak situation. However, the increasing description of epidemic cases in this area must reinforce the use of hygiene procedures to prevent diffusion of these multidrug-resistant microorganisms."
CD011926,0,15373882,0,Antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus colonising the intestines of Swedish infants.,"Staphylococcus aureus has become a frequent coloniser of the intestinal tract of infants, but the health effects of such colonisation are not clear. In this study, the antibiotic resistance patterns of 116 S. aureus strains from the commensal intestinal microflora were determined. The strains were obtained from 81 Swedish infants who had been followed with regular stool samples and registration of antibiotic usage during their first year of life. The faecal population levels of the individual strains and the duration of their persistence in the microflora had been determined previously. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance among the 116 strains was modest: methicillin, 0%; penicillin G, 78%; erythromycin A, 3%; tetracycline, 2%; clindamycin, 0.9%; and fusidic acid, 0.9%. Colonisation by antibiotic-resistant strains was unrelated to antibiotic consumption by individual infants. Antibiotic-resistant strains were as capable of persisting in the intestinal microflora and reaching high faecal population levels as fully susceptible strains. No strain lost or acquired resistance during the colonisation period. Thus, antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus seem to be as fit for competition in the large bowel microflora as susceptible strains, even in the absence of selective pressure from antibiotics. This may aggravate the ecological consequences of antibiotic resistance development."
CD011926,0,7553366,0,Use of a rapid and simple method to extract proviral DNA in the identification of HIV-1 by PCR.,"DNA extraction is a critical step in PCR analysis and is closely related to its sensitivity. Traditional methods, based on phenol-chloroform extraction, require more time and the use of toxic reagents. GeneReleaser (Bio Ventures Inc.) is a commercial product which releases DNA from whole blood, cell cultures, bacterial colonies and the like. Cells lysis and DNA extraction are accomplished directly in the amplification tube on a thermocycler. We used GeneReleaser in the identification of HIV-1 proviral DNA by PCR on whole blood samples. All samples arrived at our laboratory for HIV-1 detection were treated with two different procedures. The classical one was based on the lysis of separated lymphocytes by proteinase K, while the other consisted in DNA extraction by GeneReleaser from 5 microliters of whole blood in sodium citrate. All samples were amplified for HIV-1 GAG region; to prevent carry-over contamination Uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) sterilization was performed. Amplified sequences were revealed using the DEIA commercial system (Sorin Biomedica, Italy). To verify the suitability both of cell lysates and GeneReleaser DNA-extracted samples for PCR, we amplified a specific sequence of HLA-DQ-alpha gene. Initial data indicate that this new method might reduce the performance time of PCR (DNA extraction time was around 15 minutes) and improve PCR sensitivity."

Its immunoreactivity was analyzed by Western blotting. Serum samples were collected from outpatients of different ages from August to November, 2010 in Changchun. Indirect ELISA was established to detect the anti-CP23 IgG in sera. Western blotting analysis indicated that the recombinant CP23 protein was recognized by sera from Cryptosporidium panum-infected calves and positive human sera, but not recognized by sera of mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum, sera from falciparum malaria patients and negative human sera. The overall anti-CP23 IgG positive rate was 3.2% (65/2 046). The seropositive rate was 2.7% (28/1 036) in men and 3.7% (37/1 010) in women (P > 0.05).

Inclusion criteria were clinical signs of sepsis and positivity of one or more of the following tests: blood culture, polymerase chain reaction for bacterial and fungal DNA on blood, and culture on intravascular device tips. In all, 140 episodes of sepsis were documented in 131 children: 37 (26.4%) were healthcare outpatient-associated, 91 (65.0%) healthcare-associated and 12 (8.6%) community-acquired. The overall incidence of healthcare-associated LCBIs was 13.6/1,000 hospitalized patients and incidence density 1.4/1,000 inpatient days. The overall mortality was 3.9%. Forty-seven (36.7%) episodes involved newborns and 107 (83.6%) episodes were observed in children with an indwelling central venous catheter. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (26.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.2%), Escherichia coli (8.7%) and Candida spp. (7.2%) were responsible for the majority of cases. 9.5% of S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant and 6.5% of Gram negatives were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing. Incidence and epidemiology of medical care related LCBIs were similar to the existing literature data. LCBIs caused by antibiotic-resistant microorganisms were fewer and mortality rate was lower. Most of the LCBIs recorded involved newborns and oncological children."
CD011926,0,18693554,0,Ocular impairment of toxoplasmosis.,"The purpose of this review is to update the latest information about ocular toxoplasmosis. The infection can be congenital or acquired, but also depends about the immune condition of the patient and can affect the eye. Ocular symptoms are variable according to the age of the subject. Retinochoroiditis is the most common manifestation of toxoplasmic infection. Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis typically affects the posterior pole, and the lesions can be solitary or multiple. Active lesions present as grey-white focus of retinal necrosis with adjacent choroiditis, vasculitis, hemorrhage and vitreitis. Anterior uveitis is a common finding. Atypical presentations include punctate outer retinitis, neuroretinitis and papillitis. Depending on the patient's age and the localization of the lesion, ocular symptoms vary usually presenting with reduced visual acuity or without symptoms. The laboratory diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is based on detection of antibodies and T. gondii DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which fulfillis clinical findings. Toxoplasmosis therapy includes antimicrobial drugs and corticosteroids. There are several regimens with different drug combinations including, among others, pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol."

Five neonates born to these mothers were found to be colonized with P. mirabilis. We report here on the use of DNA fingerprinting by the arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction technique (AP-PCR) for the epidemiological investigation of this sudden outbreak. This approach was compared with the analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of ribosomal DNA regions (ribotyping). Results of the AP-PCR and of ribotyping were in complete agreement in showing the genetic unrelatedness of the isolates obtained from each mother. Moreover, the results showed mother-to-infant vertical transmission of P. mirabilis in the neonates. AP-PCR is a rapid and discriminative method which seems particularly well suited to the epidemiological study of P. mirabilis."

To determine the effects of this virus on pregnancy outcomes, we conducted a study of pregnant women in Reunion in 2006. The study population was composed of 1,400 pregnant women (628 uninfected, 658 infected during pregnancy, 27 infected before pregnancy, and 87 infected on unknown dates). We compared pregnancy outcomes for 655 (628 + 27) women not infected during pregnancy with 658 who were infected during pregnancy. Infection occurred during the first trimester for 15% of the infected women, the second for 59%, and the third for 26%. Only hospital admission during pregnancy differed between infected and uninfected women (40% vs. 29%). Other outcomes (cesarean deliveries, obstetric hemorrhaging, preterm births, stillbirths after 22 weeks, birthweight, congenital malformations, and newborn admissions) were similar.

We present the case of a Zimbabwean woman who tested positive for HIV-1 infection on routine antenatal bloods at 15 weeks gestation. Her CD4 count was 500 cells/mm(3); however, HIV-1 RNA viral load measured below the level of detection on several assays. A Cavidi ExaVir reverse transcriptase assay was below the level of detection. Pro-viral DNA was positive using long terminal repeat primers and sequencing demonstrated subtype C virus. Zidovudine monotherapy (250 mg twice daily) was commenced at 24 weeks for the prevention of mother to child transmission. She was keen for a standard vaginal delivery, having had one previously, and she delivered a healthy baby without complications at 39 weeks gestation. The neonate received four weeks of Zidovudine and tested negative for HIV infection. We discuss some challenges involved in the management of a pregnant 'elite controller'."
CD011926,0,15962557,0,Serological and virological features of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever in Thailand from 1999 to 2002.,"Serological and virological features of dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Thailand were analysed in 2715 patients from 1999 to 2002. The illness was caused by DEN-1 in 45%, DEN-2 in 32%, DEN-3 in 18% and DEN-4 in 5% of patients. Almost all of the DHF cases caused by DEN-2 and DEN-4 were in secondary infection, while approximately 20% of the DHF cases caused by DEN-1 and DEN-3 were in primary infection. Male:female ratio and age distribution were not different among four serotypes in primary and secondary infections. These results indicate that DEN-1 and DEN-3 induce DHF in both primary and secondary infections, and suggest that DEN-2 and DEN-4 in Thailand are less likely to cause DHF in primary infections."

CD011926,0,10755631,0,Clinical and microbiological epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteraemia.,"A survey of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteraemia in the Grampian region of Scotland was carried out over a 2-year period. One hundred and four bacteraemic episodes were identified in 103 patients, an incidence of 9.8/100,000 population/year, and the mortality was 24%. Clinical information was abstracted from 92 sets of patient notes and 98 isolates of S. pneumoniae were available for further study. The incidence of S. pneumoniae bacteraemia was highest at the extremes of age and peaked at 78 cases/100,000 population/year in those over 80 years old. Many patients had predisposing conditions, of which chronic lung disease (23%), chronic alcohol abuse (10%) and malignant disease (10%) were the commonest. Age was the highest risk factor for mortality, with 20 of the 22 deaths in those over 65 years old. The commonest serotype of S. pneumoniae isolated was serotype 14 (23.5%). Only one isolate (serotype 6A) showed intermediate resistance to penicillin, but 12 isolates (12.2%) were resistant to erythromycin. Nine of these 12 isolates were of serotype 14 and had MICs clustered in the range 12-24 mg/L. Examination of all serotype 14 isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed the presence of two distinct genetic clusters, with all the erythromycin-resistant isolates in the same cluster. These isolates had similar PFGE profiles to erythromycin-resistant serotype 14 strains isolated elsewhere in the UK and they were positive for the mefE gene by PCR, confirming that resistance was of the M phenotype. The recent increase in erythromycin resistance in S. pneumoniae may be due, at least in part, to the spread of a serotype 14 clone of the M phenotype which appears to be an important cause of invasive disease."

Currently, 16 genotypes have been described based on phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequences, all of which have a global distribution. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPeV in Thailand. A total of 171 fecal specimens collected during October 2012 to May 2013 from children with diarrhea in Chiang Mai, Thailand were investigated for HPeV by RT-PCR and sequence analysis. HPeVs were found in 3 out of 171 (1.8%) fecal specimens tested. Of these, one was HPeV1 which is commonly detected in children with gastroenteritis and another one was uncommon HPeV14 genotype. Most interestingly, the sequence of the third HPeV positive sample (CMH-N185-12) did not cluster with any of the known 16 genotypes and therefore is proposed as a candidate HPeV genotype 17."

The serotype-specific carriage picture in adults was compared with that observed in children by means of a cross-sectional study performed one year before using the same sampling and laboratory methods.   Cluster sampling enrolled 283 adults, representative of the open population. Detection of multi-serotype carriage was performed using, real-time PCR and primer specific PCRs. Carriage prevalence of participants with at least one positive sample adjusted for age, i.e., period prevalence, was 18.7%, considering the Ligurian population as standard population, showing that the pneumococcal carriage in the elderly is not a rare event as emerged in other surveys. The long-term use of PCV7 has resulted in strong decrease of vaccine types carriage among adults and children. A multivariate analysis showed that age class and contact with children attending day care covariates were strongly associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage. A strong link between the picture observed in < 5-y-old children and ≥ 60-y-old adults emerged: a strong correlation of specific-serotype prevalence between adults and children and risk factor analysis supported the role played by inter-age-group transmission."

The objectives of this work are to compare the results of the polymerase reaction in blood spots and urine as well as point out the relevance of the result in the Guthrie cards to differentiate congenital from perinatal infection. A total of 148 patients suspicious of CMVH infections were studied in the Congenital Perinatal Infections and Sexual Transmission Laboratory, at the National Institute ""Carlos G. Malbrán"". The dry blood samples (Guthrie cards) and urine of all patients were studied through the polymerase chain reaction. From the 148 patients, 3 presented other infections, 95 tested negative and 50 positive for cytomegalovirus: 35 had congenital infection and 15 perinatal. In the congenital cases, the polymerase reaction in dry blood was positive (sensitivity 100%, specificity 98.9%, VPP 98% and VPN 100%). Four of them with tardive symptoms were studied retrospectively. The urine specimens from the remaining 15 patients that were taken 15 days after birth were analyzed through the same methods, showing a sensitivity of 100%, the retrospective analysis of this dry blood group yielded negative results, so the infection was considered perinatal. Thus, the dry blood polymerase reaction of the newborn infants makes it a reliable assay for diagnosing congenital cytomegalovirus infection and could be used as an alternative method to urine polymerase reaction. In addition, this test is able to reveal whether the infection is congenital or perinatal in those cases of late symptom or other cases of controversial origin."

Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for culture and nucleic acid testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Bordetella pertussis. Immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G antibodies against pertussis toxin (PT) were tested by ELISA in paired serum samples. A total of 148 patients were recruited during 1 y. Pertussis was detected in 25 (16.9%) patients with at least 1 of the tests. PCR was positive in 12 patients, and 9 cases was diagnosed serologically. Both PCR and serology were positive in 4 children. Duration of cough was longer in the patients with pertussis (median 33 vs 20, p = 0.03). Seropositivity of pertussis toxin was higher in pertussis negative patients during enrollment (24% vs 65%, p = 0.005). From the results of this study, B. pertussis seems to be common in our population despite high immunization rates with whole cell vaccine.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were differences in Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP) waves and interval interwaves in a group of Zidovudine (AZT) alone or AZT plus Lamivudine (3TC) prenatally exposed infants as the result of a mother with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection; compared with a group of infants not exposed to antiretroviral drugs. Results couls provide an index of neurotoxicity in newborns. Pregnant women were recruited at the first trimester of pregnancy, when they were diagnosed with HIV syndrome. Infants were included in the study if they were exposed prenatally to AZT alone or AZT plus 3TC. BAEP recordings were blinded from each investigator and results compared with a cephalic perimeter-matched control group of non-exposed infants. Comparison of wave latencies showed significant delay of wave I and I-III interwave interval in the AZT-3TC-treated group. The present findings suggest that prenatal exposure to the antiretroviral drugs AZT and/or 3TC is related to increased latencies in wave I and I-III interwave interval. This finding may provide an index of toxicity in lower regions of the brainstem in exposed infants."

CD011926,0,20336337,0,A review of diagnostic tests for congenital syphilis in newborns.,"Congenital syphilis (CS) can occur when a mother is inadequately treated or not treated at all for an active Treponema pallidum infection. Symptoms of CS are often subtle and non-specific, and it is estimated that up to 60% of affected infants are asymptomatic at birth, making the diagnosis dependent on laboratory findings. Despite decades of experience with CS, problems still arise in its diagnosis because laboratory test results for children at risk for CS can be inconclusive and no single diagnostic test can be used to diagnose CS. The development of diagnostic tests such as enzyme immunoassays, immunoblotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has increased the sensitivity and specificity of diagnoses, but the detection of specific IgM is currently the most sensitive serological method, and the presence of specific IgM should be considered as evidence of a congenital T. pallidum infection. Suspected cases can also be confirmed or excluded by serial post-partum tests of antibody kinetics. The authors note strongly that it is considered unethical not to treat a baby at risk of contracting CS, even without a definitive diagnosis. In this review, we describe the various microbiological methods-and their shortcomings-used in the laboratory diagnosis of CS."

CD011926,0,12909300,0,Clinical relevance of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and antigen-driven immunoblots for the diagnosis of neurological infectious diseases.,"Polymerase chain reaction assays are a powerful tool for detecting the presence of infectious genomes in the cerebrospinal fluid. Positive results always mean a current or pending infection of the central nervous system. Subacute (>7 days) or chronic infections induce an intrathecal humoral immune response and the appearance of oligoclonal IgG antibodies directed against the causal infectious agent. This local synthesis may be observed even in cases of severe systemic immunodeficiency. The use of polymerase chain reactions in combination with the detection of a specific intrathecal immune response should represent the most reliable strategy for the diagnosis of viral and chronic infections of the central nervous system. The authors describe their experience, using this approach, in herpetic encephalitis, acute and recurrent herpetic meningitis, varicella zoster-induced neurological diseases, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalitis and tuberculous meningitis."

Primers and oligonucleotide probes, based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene, were arrayed by imprinting on microarray slides. Blood specimens collected from 172 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and then tested separately by PCR for the bacterial 16S rRNA. Of the 172 clinical cases, 17 cases tested positive by PCR. The number of positives identified by PCR (9.88%) was significantly higher than the number of positives identified by the blood culture (4.65%). When blood culture was used as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100%, the specificity was 97.85%, and the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.979. When the 17 PCR positive specimens were further analyzed by hybridization against the microarrays, five were found to be probe positive for E. coli, four were positive for S. epidermidis, four were positive for CoNS, and two were positive for Bacillus and Propionibacterium, respectively. In the eight specimens showing positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the species determined by microarray analysis corresponded with the result obtained from blood culture. Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by PCR and microarray analysis can be used to accurately diagnose neonatal sepsis. This method has a higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia."

CD011926,0,25323940,0,Characterization by phenotypic and genotypic methods of metallo-β-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa continues to be a predominant cause of infections with high intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, resulting in treatment failure. P. aeruginosa is the leading cause of respiratory infections among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Resistance to carbapenem antibiotics among P. aeruginosa has been reported. Thus, this study was undertaken to characterize the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) production of P. aeruginosa by phenotypic and genotypic methods. A total of 572 sputum samples were collected from cystic fibrosis patients along with the patient demographic details in a questionnaire. In total, 217 P. aeruginosa isolates were collected and an antibiogram revealed that 159 (73.3%) and 141 (64.9%) of these colonies exhibited resistance to imipenem and meropenem, respectively. Ceftazidime and tobramycin resistance were both identified in 112 (51.6%) isolates, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, gatifloxacin and netilmicin was detected in 96 (44.2%) respective samples. A total of 62 (28.6%) respective samples were resistant to cefoperazone, cefepime and ceftriaxone. The least antibiotic resistance was shown to amikacin and ceftizoxime with 51 (23.5%) and 32 (14.7%) respective colonies resistant to the antibiotics. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for imipenem revealed a reduction in the MIC values. MBL screening by the zone enhancement method using ceftazidime plus EDTA discs demonstrated that 63 (56.25%) of the colonies were positive for MBL. A total of 53 (84.1%) samples expressed blaVIM and 48 (76.1%) expressed blaIMP genes, as detected by duplex polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, carbapenem resistance is of great clinical concern in cystic fibrosis patients with P. aeruginosa infection. Therefore, mandatory regular screening and monitoring the resistance in P. aeruginosa among CF patients is required."
CD011926,0,10833965,0,[Hepatitis C virus infection among pregnant women and their children in Norway].,Estimates indicate the births of 6 to 78 children vertically infected with hepatitis C virus infection each year in Norway. There is insufficient knowledge of the magnitude of this health problem and the National Institute of Public Health commissioned the authors to approach issues relating to vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Norway. The risk of vertical transmission of HCV appears to be associated with the titre of the maternal viral load. Vertical transmission from nonviraemic mothers has not been demonstrated. No postexposure prophylaxis exists. There is a lack of association between vertical HCV transmission and delivery mode and no association with breast feeding. Universal screening for HCV infection among pregnant women is not recommended. Children born to women known to be HCV-positive should be followed up with antibody and polymerase chain reaction investigations in order to clarify their HCV status. More studies of HCV infection among pregnant women and their children in Norway are needed.

To our knowledge intractable diarrhoea at two weeks of age caused by postnatally acquired CMV in immunocompetent term neonate is not reported. An unusual case of postnatally acquired CMV enterocolitis manifesting as protracted diarrhoea in an immunocompetent baby in neonatal period is reported. We conclude that CMV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intractable diarrhoea in neonatal period and treatment with intravenous ganciclovir for CMV enterocolitis is not only indicated but is therapeutic."
CD011926,0,19307211,0,The plasmid of Escherichia coli strain S88 (O45:K1:H7) that causes neonatal meningitis is closely related to avian pathogenic E. coli plasmids and is associated with high-level bacteremia in a neonatal rat meningitis model.,"A new Escherichia coli virulent clonal group, O45:K1, belonging to the highly virulent subgroup B2(1) was recently identified in France, where it accounts for one-third of E. coli neonatal meningitis cases. Here we describe the sequence, epidemiology and function of the large plasmid harbored by strain S88, which is representative of the O45:K1 clonal group. Plasmid pS88 is 133,853 bp long and contains 144 protein-coding genes. It harbors three different iron uptake systems (aerobactin, salmochelin, and the sitABCD genes) and other putative virulence genes (iss, etsABC, ompT(P), and hlyF). The pS88 sequence is composed of several gene blocks homologous to avian pathogenic E. coli plasmids pAPEC-O2-ColV and pAPEC-O1-ColBM. PCR amplification of 11 open reading frames scattered throughout the plasmid was used to investigate the distribution of pS88 and showed that a pS88-like plasmid is present in other meningitis clonal groups such as O18:K1, O1:K1, and O83:K1. A pS88-like plasmid was also found in avian pathogenic strains and human urosepsis strains belonging to subgroup B2(1). A variant of S88 cured of its plasmid displayed a marked loss of virulence relative to the wild-type strain in a neonatal rat model, with bacteremia more than 2 log CFU/ml lower. The salmochelin siderophore, a known meningovirulence factor, could not alone explain the plasmid's contribution to virulence, as a salmochelin mutant displayed only a minor fall in bacteremia (0.9 log CFU/ml). Thus, pS88 is a major virulence determinant related to avian pathogenic plasmids that has spread not only through meningitis clonal groups but also human urosepsis and avian pathogenic strains."

CD011926,0,24747588,0,Four DNA extraction methods used in loop-mediated isothermal amplification for rapid adenovirus detection.,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have become powerful tools for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases. A more efficient, convenient and cheaper method for template preparation from the pellets or supernatants of nasopharyngeal aspirates was sought. Three DNA extraction methods (boiling, boiling in 1% Triton X-100, and treating with 0.02M NaOH) were compared with the commonly used DNAzol DNA extraction method. DNA preparations were then subjected to adenovirus (ADV) detection using LAMP assays and 119 clinical samples. The specificities for all three methods were 100% compared with the DNAzol method. The sensitivity of the boiling method was greater than that for the other two methods. The templates extracted from supernatants of nasopharyngeal aspirates using the boiling technique were further evaluated. Higher sensitivity (90.9%) and specificity (96.5%) were observed for LAMP assays compared with those from quantitative PCR assays. In conclusion, for template preparation, boiling supernatants of nasopharyngeal aspirates had comparable sensitivity and specificity with the DNAzol method. There were the added advantages that the boiling technique was simpler, cheaper, and had a shorter processing time. The boiling technique could become a suitable substitute for the DNAzol method when LAMP assays are used for ADV detection."
CD011926,0,25074284,0,"Comparison of human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and Rhinovirus respiratory tract infections in young children admitted to hospital.","Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and Rhinoviruses (RV) are frequent causes of respiratory tract infections in young children. We compared laboratory and clinical findings in children with comparable age distribution and hospitalized due to RSV, HMPV or RV infections. Viral pathogens were detected by a quantitative real time PCR from nasopharyngeal aspirates. No significant differences in the admission diagnosis, laboratory parameters, patient demographics and treatment measures between the three viral causes of respiratory illness were found. No correlation between viral load and disease severity was observed however, there was a significantly lower concentration of the nasopharyngeal interleukin 8 (IL-8) in children with RV compared to HMPV and RSV, indicating a milder proinflammatory reaction. Moreover, RV-infected children had significantly lower body temperature, higher leucocyte counts in peripheral blood, and a tendency to have a shorter stay in hospital than children with either HMPV or RSV infection. Taken together, clinical presentation of the infections with RSV, HMPV, and RV is similar among children of the same age group and not clearly distinguishable by standard clinical or laboratory findings. Therefore, virus specific testing should be included regularly for routine diagnosis of children with respiratory tract infections."

CD011926,0,18199787,0,Evaluation of different cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA PCR protocols for analysis of dried blood spots from consecutive cases of neonates with congenital CMV infections.,"Two protocols for the extraction of cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA and two methods for the amplification of CMV DNA in dried blood spots were evaluated for the retrospective diagnosis of congenital CMV infection. During the period from 1996 to 2006, a urine screening program detected 76 congenitally infected neonates. Stored Guthrie cards with blood from 55 cases and 12 controls were tested. Two spots of dried blood were cut from each card and evaluated in two centers. CMV DNA was extracted from a whole single spot. Center 1 used phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation followed by a conventional PCR. Center 2 used the NucliSens easyMAG automated DNA/RNA extraction platform (bioMérieux) followed by a real-time PCR. For evaluation of the extraction method, DNA extracted from each blood spot was evaluated by the amplification method used by the collaborating center. The sensitivities were 66% for center 1 and 73% for center 2. None of the controls were positive. A sensitivity as high as 82% could be obtained by combining the most sensitive extraction method (the phenol-chloroform procedure) with the most sensitive PCR method (real-time PCR). The detection rate was not influenced by the duration of storage of the spots. The sensitivity was higher with blood from congenitally infected cases due to a primary maternal CMV infection, regardless of the protocol used. However, the difference reached significance only for the least-sensitive protocol (P = 0.036)."
CD011926,0,18039801,0,"Colonization and persistence of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains in infants nursed in two neonatal intensive care units in East London, United Kingdom.","Stool samples were collected from infants nursed in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in East London, United Kingdom. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for the carriage of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae strains (MRE; resistant to three or more classes of antibiotic) and the extent of the persistence of resistant strains following discharge. Sixty-two (50%) of 124 infants had acquired MRE by 2 weeks of postnatal age, and 69 (56%) infants had acquired MRE by discharge. The proportions of infants at 2 weeks carrying strains that were resistant to antibiotics were the following: tetracycline, 79%; amoxicillin, 78%; cephalosporins, 31%; trimethoprim, 20%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 11%; chloramphenicol, 9%; and aminoglycoside, 4%. A gestational age of less than 26 weeks was a risk factor for colonization with MRE at discharge, but not at 2 weeks. Analysis within a NICU showed that exposure of an infant to a specific antibiotic in the NICU was not a risk factor for the carriage of a strain resistant to that antibiotic. Estimates of persistence from discharge to 6 months were the following: for tetracycline, 57% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.35 to 0.87); chloramphenicol, 49% (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.83); trimethoprim, 45% (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.74); piperacillin-tazobactam, 42% (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.71); and augmentin, 34% (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.66). Strains resistant to cephalosporins or aminoglycosides showed lower levels of persistence. Nine of 34 infants (26.5%) with Escherichia coli and 4 (7.1%) of 56 infants with Klebsiella spp. at discharge carried strains indistinguishable by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA and antibiotic susceptibility patterns at 6 months. MRE were found at high frequency in the infants during their stay in the NICU and persisted in a proportion of infants."

The objective of this study was to evaluate C. parapsilosis sensu lato infection scenarios, regarding species distribution and strain relatedness. One hundred isolates of C. parapsilosis sensu lato derived from blood cultures and catheter tips were analysed by multiplex microsatellite typing and by sequencing D1/D2 regions of the ribosomal DNA. Our results indicate that 9.5 % of patients presented infections due to C. parapsilosis and Candida orthopsilosis, 57.1 % due to C. parapsilosis, 28.3 % due to C. orthopsilosis and 4.8 % due to Candida metapsilosis. Eighty per cent of the C. parapsilosis BSIs were due to a single strain that was also identified in the catheter, but in 10 % of the cases C. parasilosis was identified in the catheter but the BSI was due to C. orthopsilosis. There is a significant probability that C. parapsilosis isolates collected from the same patient at more than 3 months interval are of different strains (P = 0.0179). Moreover, several isolates were identified persistently in the same hospital, infecting six different patients. The incidence of polyfungal BSI infections with C. parapsilosis and C. orthopsilosis is reported herein for the first time, emphasizing the fact that the species identified in the catheter is not always responsible for the BSI, thus impacting the treatment strategy. The observation that strains can remain in the hospital environment for years highlights the possible existence of reservoirs and reinforces the need for accurate genotyping tools, such as the markers used for elucidating epidemiological associations and detecting outbreaks."

In the present study, we describe nine cases of the various types of infection caused by Gordonia spp. From 1997 to 2008, 66 isolates (from 30 patients) initially identified as Rhodoccus spp. by conventional biochemical methods, by the Bacteriology Laboratory of National Taiwan University Hospital, were retrospectively analysed to assess the accuracy of species identification. Fifteen of these isolates (from nine patients) were later found to be Gordonia spp. by two molecular methods: PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism for heat shock protein gene (hsp65) and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. Gordonia sputi (n = 8) was the most common species, followed by Gordonia terrae (n = 7). Most of the isolates were isolated from blood (n = 11), followed by soft tissue (n = 2) and eye (n = 2). Five patients presented with bacteraemia and two of these had catheter-related bloodstream infection. Two patients had soft tissue infections and another two patients had infective keratitis and conjunctivitis. The random amplified polymorphic DNA patterns for isolates from different patients were different, indicating that they were genetically unrelated. Accurate identification with molecular methods is required if the role of Gordonia spp. in causing infection is to be recognized."
CD011926,0,12089249,0,Horizontal transmission of Candida parapsilosis candidemia in a neonatal intensive care unit.,"This report describes the nosocomial acquisition of Candida parapsilosis candidemia by one of the six premature newborns housed in the same room of a neonatal intensive care unit at the Ospedale Santa Chiara, Pisa, Italy. The infant had progeria, a disorder characterized by retarded physical development and progressive senile degeneration. The infant, who was not found to harbor C. parapsilosis at the time of his admission to the intensive care unit, had exhibited symptomatic conjunctivitis before the onset of a severe bloodstream infection. In order to evaluate the source of infection and the route of transmission, two independent molecular typing methods were used to determine the genetic relatedness among the isolates recovered from the newborn, the inanimate hospital environment, hospital personnel, topically and intravenously administered medicaments, and indwelling catheters. Among the isolates collected, only those recovered from the hands of two nurses attending the newborns and from both the conjunctiva and the blood of the infected infant were genetically indistinguishable. Since C. parapsilosis was never recovered from indwelling catheters or from any of the drugs administered to the newborn, we concluded that (i) horizontal transmission of C. parapsilosis occurred through direct interaction between nurses and the newborn and (ii) the conjunctiva was the site through which C. parapsilosis entered the bloodstream. This finding highlights the possibility that a previous C. parapsilosis colonization and/or infection of other body sites may be a predisposing condition for subsequent C. parapsilosis hematogenous dissemination in severely ill newborns."

This study compared the efficacy of single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and high-performance liquid chromatography under partially denaturing conditions (dHPLC) for screening mutations in CGD patients. We selected 10 male CGD patients with a clinical history of severe recurrent infections and abnormal respiratory burst function. gDNA, mRNA and cDNA samples were prepared by standard methods. CYBB exons were amplified by PCR and screened by SSCP or dHPLC. Abnormal DNA fragments were sequenced to reveal the nature of the mutations. The SSCP and dHPLC methods showed DNA abnormalities, respectively, in 55% and 100% of the cases. Sequencing of the abnormal DNA samples confirmed mutations in all cases. Four novel mutations in CYBB were identified which were picked up only by the dHPLC screening (c.904 insC, c.141+5 g>t, c.553 T>C, and c.665 A>T). This work highlights the relevance of dHPLC, a sensitive, fast, reliable and cost-effective method for screening mutations in CGD, which in combination with functional assays assessing the phagocyte respiratory burst will contribute to expedite the definitive diagnosis of X-linked CGD, direct treatment, genetic counselling and to have a clear assumption of the prognosis. This strategy is especially suitable for developing countries."

Their epidemiologies and clinical characteristics are poorly described and are often reliant on case reports. To address these problems, we conducted a large-scale comprehensive screening for all four coronaviruses by analysis of 11,661 diagnostic respiratory samples collected in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, over 3 years between July 2006 and June 2009 using a novel four-way multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay. Coronaviruses were detected in 0.3 to 0.85% of samples in all age groups. Generally, coronaviruses displayed marked winter seasonality between the months of December and April and were not detected in summer months, which is comparable to the pattern seen with influenza viruses. HCoV-229E was the exception; detection was confined to the winter of 2008 and was sporadic in the following year. There were additional longer-term differences in detection frequencies between seasons, with HCoV-OC43 predominant in the first and third seasons and HCoV-HKU1 dominating in the second (see Results for definitions of seasons). A total of 11 to 41% of coronaviruses detected were in samples testing positive for other respiratory viruses, although clinical presentations of coronavirus monoinfections were comparable to those of viruses which have an established role in respiratory disease, such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses. The novel multiplex assay for real-time pan-coronavirus detection enhances respiratory virus diagnosis, overcomes potential diagnostic problems arising through seasonal variation in coronavirus frequency, and provides novel insights into the epidemiology and clinical implications of coronaviruses."
CD011926,0,16300916,0,Virological analysis in the diagnosis of sudden children death: a medico-legal approach.,"Infections are considered to be an important cause of unexpected death in children. It has also been assumed that respiratory viruses are involved in the genesis of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The Spanish National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Sciences act as the forensic reference centre for Spain. We analyse the experience of this centre in the virological study of 64 cases of sudden children death where viral serology, virological cultures, herpesviruses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electron microscopy were performed. According to pathological findings, death could only be attributed to an adenovirus infection in one amygdalitis with upper airways stenosis and asphyxia. Human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) was detected by PCR in one case with pathological findings characteristic of SIDS. Recent infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were also detected. Meanwhile, 85.9% of the cases yielded negative viral results. Twenty-eight infants were finally categorised as SIDS. Pathological findings of infection were detected in 12 patients despite the negativity of viral analyses. Although viral infection is an uncommon cause of sudden children death, a complete microbiological investigation will help to solve the puzzle of SIDS. Definitive guidelines for microbiological analyses need to be updated whilst new pathogens are discovered or new techniques are implemented in order to clarify unsolved cases."
CD011926,0,12401298,0,"Neonatal herpes infection: diagnosis, treatment and prevention.","Approximately 2000 neonates contract infection due to herpes simplex virus each year in the United States. Although herpes simplex virus type 2 is responsible for most neonatal infections, approximately 30% of infections are caused by herpes simplex virus type 1. Infections are categorized by extent of disease into skin/eye/mouth, central nervous system and disseminated disease categories. Each disease category is responsible for roughly one third of neonatal infections. Mortality is highest in disseminated disease. Morbidity is highest for survivors of central nervous system infection. Treatment with high dose parenteral acyclovir (60 mg/kg/day) for 14-21 days improves outcome. Since most neonatal infections are acquired from contact with infected maternal genital tract secretions, potential preventative strategies include: Caesarean delivery, serologic screening of pregnant women, prophylactic acyclovir and vaccination. The two strategies currently accepted by most obstetricians are Caesarean delivery for women with active lesions or prodromal symptoms and prophylactic acyclovir for women with gestational herpes."

We treated eight highly viraemic (HBV-DNA >/= 1.2 x 10(9) geq/mL) mothers with 150 mg of lamivudine daily during the last month of pregnancy. HBV-DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HBs and anti-HBc of their offspring were measured at birth and at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Twenty-four children, born to untreated HBsAg-positive mothers with HBV-DNA levels >/=1.2 x 10(9) geq/mL served as historical controls. All children received passive-active immunization at birth and were followed-up for 12 months. In the lamivudine group one of the eight children (12.5%) was still HBsAg and HBV-DNA positive at the age of 12 months. All other children seroconverted to anti-HBs and maintained seroprotection. In three children, HBV-DNA was temporarily detected by polymerase chain reaction. In the untreated historical control group, perinatal transmission occurred in seven of 25 children (28%).

CD011926,0,18287314,0,Population structure of invasive and colonizing strains of Streptococcus agalactiae from neonates of six U.S. Academic Centers from 1995 to 1999.,"The purpose of this study was to describe the population structure of group B streptococci (GBS) isolated from infected and colonized neonates during a prospective active-surveillance study of early-onset disease in six centers in the United States from July 1995 to June 1999 and to examine its relationship to bovine strains of GBS. The phylogenetic lineage of each GBS isolate was determined by multilocus sequence typing, and isolates were clustered into clonal complexes (CCs) using the eBURST software program. A total of 899 neonatal GBS isolates were studied, of which 129 were associated with invasive disease. Serotype Ia, Ib, and V isolates were highly clonal, with 92% to 96% of serotype Ia, Ib, and V isolates being confined to single clonal clusters. In contrast, serotype II and III isolates were each comprised of two major clones, with 39% of serotype II and 41% of serotype III isolates in CC 17 and 41% of serotype II and 54% of serotype III isolates in CC 19. Further analysis demonstrates that the CC 17 serotype II and III GBS are closely related to a previously described ""ancestral"" lineage of bovine GBS. While 120 (93%) of invasive GBS were confined to the same lineages that colonized neonates, 9 (7%) of the invasive GBS isolates were from rare lineages that comprised only 2.7% of colonizing lineages. These results are consistent with those for other geographic regions that demonstrate the highly clonal nature of GBS infecting and colonizing human neonates."
CD011926,0,20166174,0,Genetic variation of G4P[6] rotaviruses: evidence for novel strains circulating between the hospital and community.,"One hundred forty-six fecal specimens collected between 2007 and 2008 from infants with acute gastroenteritis were screened for rotavirus by ELISA with VP6-specific antibody. One hundred twenty-three of the samples (84.2%) were confirmed to be positive for group A rotavirus (community-acquired, n = 90 [73.2%] and nosocomial, n = 33 [26.8%]), and were typed subsequently using RT-PCR and sequence analysis methods. Determination of G- and P-type combinations showed that G4P[6] (78.9%) was the most common strain, followed by G3P[8] (7.3%), G1P[8] (6.5%), G2P[4] (0.8%), G2P[6] (0.8%), G1P[6] (0.8%), and G9P[8] (0.8%) strains. Of the 97 G4P[6] strains, 62 (63.8%) were responsible for community-acquired cases and 35 (36.1%) were hospital-acquired cases. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene from the G4P[6] strains revealed that both the community-acquired and nosocomial strains were segregated to the human rotaviruses circulating world-wide, including the prototype vaccinal strain, ST3, which constituted a novel sublineage in lineage 1. Owing to the recent emergence of G4P[6] rotaviruses within the hospital, as well as in the community, the findings from this study are important since they provide new information concerning the community and nosocomial spread of rotaviruses."
CD011926,0,20844210,0,Real-time quantitative PCR detection of four human bocaviruses.,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) was discovered in 2005 and is associated with respiratory tract symptoms in young children. Three additional members of the genus Bocavirus, HBoV2, -3, and -4, were discovered recently from fecal specimens, and early results indicate an association between HBoV2 and gastrointestinal disease. In this study, we present an undifferentiating multiplex real-time quantitative PCR assay for the detection of these novel viruses. Differentiation of the individual bocavirus species can be subsequently achieved with corresponding singleplex PCRs or by sequencing. Both multiplex and singleplex assays were consistently able to detect ≤10 copies of HBoV1 to -4 plasmid templates/reaction, with dynamic quantification ranges of 8 logs and 97% to 102% average reaction efficiencies. These new assays were used to screen stool samples from 250 Finnish patients (median age, 40 years) that had been sent for diagnosis of gastrointestinal infection. Four patients (1.6%; median age, 1.1 years) were reproducibly positive for HBoV2, and one patient (0.4%; 18 years of age) was reproducibly positive for HBoV3. The viral DNA loads varied from <10(3) to 10(9) copies/ml of stool extract. None of the stool samples harbored HBoV1 or HBoV4. The highly conserved sequence of the hydrolysis probe used in this assay may provide a flexible future platform for the quantification of additional, hitherto-unknown human bocaviruses that might later be discovered. Our results support earlier findings that HBoV2 is a relatively common pathogen in the stools of diarrheic young children, yet does not often occur in the stools of adults."

In this prospective study, we evaluated the RV16 assay by comparing with the Seeplex(®) RV12 ACE detection kit (RV12; Seegene), a multiplex end-point PCR kit. A total of 365 consecutive respiratory specimens were tested with both RV16 and RV12 assays in parallel and detected 140 (38.4%) and 89 (24.4%) positive cases, respectively. The positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and kappa values for the 2 assays were 95.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.4-98.3%), 80.4% (95% CI, 75.3-84.6%), and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56-0.72), respectively. The monoplex PCR and sequencing for the samples with discrepant results revealed that majority of the results were concordant with the results from RV16 assays. In conclusion, the RV16 assay produces results comparable to the RV12 assay."
CD011926,0,19656984,0,Molecular surveillance and population structure analysis of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in high-risk wards.,"In this study we report the results of analysis of 253 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (132 methicillin [meticillin]-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] isolates and 121 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] isolates) from 209 patients admitted to 18 high-risk wards of six hospitals located in Florence, Italy, over an 8-month period during which a program of epidemiological surveillance of hospital-acquired infections was conducted. The majority (69%) of the 87 reported S. aureus infections were caused by MRSA. No outbreak events have been reported. All the isolates were typed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and AFLP profiles were analyzed in order to define similarity groups. The discriminatory power of AFLP is very high with MSSA (Simpson index of diversity [D], 95.9%), whereas its resolution capability with MRSA (D, 44.7%) is hampered by the well-known high clonality of these populations (the main MRSA group accounted for 74% of the MRSA isolates). Combining AFLP, improved by visual inspection of polymorphisms, with multiplex PCR greatly increases MRSA resolution (D, 85.5%), resolving the MRSA population to a level that is one of the highest reported in the literature. Widespread and sporadic clones of MSSA and MRSA were identified, and their diffusion in the different hospitals and wards over the surveillance period was studied. The understanding of MSSA and MRSA population structures should be the starting point for the design of a more rational surveillance program for S. aureus species, maximizing benefits and reducing the cost of infection control strategies."

Of the 69 patients (2 patients had 2 herpesvirus DNA detected in CSF) who had herpesvirus DNA detected in the CSF, 60 (87%) were non-immunocompromised (CMV 7; HHV-6 6; EBV 16; HSV-1 18; HSV-2 9 and VZV 6) and 9 (13%) were immunocompromised (CMV 3; HHV-6 0; EBV 5; HSV-1 0; HSV-2 1 and VZV 0). The study was performed in a retrospective/prospective manner. The HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV and CMV DNA-positive patients usually had typical clinical syndromes, such as encephalitis/myelitis and meningitis, but also other neurological conditions were associated with findings of these viruses. HHV-6 and EBV DNA were detected in patients presenting with a variety of neurological symptoms, and in some of the cases, concurrent with diagnosis of other infections of the central nervous system. Despite the overall variability of clinical conditions seen, a pattern associated with each investigated herpesvirus was discernable as regards clinical presentation."

CD011926,0,16882616,0,Nosocomial infection in newborns by Pichia anomala in a Brazilian intensive care unit.,"Disseminated candidiasis is the most common nosocomial fungal infection, and Candida albicans has been reported to account for 50% to more than 70% of cases of invasive candidiasis. However, recent reports have also suggested the emergence of infections caused by non-albicans species. In addition, less-common pathogenic yeasts (Malassezia, Trichosporon, Rhodotorula, Debaryomyces and Pichia) have recently been reported, with increased frequency, as causes of nosocomial infections with high mortality. This article describes two cases of fungemia caused by Pichia anomala in newborns that occurred in an intensive care unit (ICU), in November 2004 at the Instituto da Criança (Pediatric Institute) of the Hospital das Clínicas of the School of Medicine, São Paulo University, Brazil. The principal factors related to virulence (proteinase and phospholipase) and the susceptibility of the isolated strains to antifungal agents were also evaluated, and the biotype of each strain was determined through the use of an epidemiological marker (killer biotype)."

HBoV and five other major enteric viruses were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Human rotavirus (HRV) was the most prevalent pathogen, detected in 250 (22·2%) cases, followed by enteric adenovirus (EADV) in 76 (6·7%) cases, human astrovirus (HAstV) in 38 (3·4%) cases, HBoV in 17 (1·5%) cases, sapovirus (SaV) in 14 (1·2%) cases, and norovirus (NoV) in 9 (0·8%) cases. Co-infections were identified in 3·7% of the study population and 23·5% of HBoV-positive specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 14 HBoV strains to be clustered into species HBoV1 with only minor variations among them. Overall, the detection of HBoV appears to partially contribute to the overall detection gap for enteric infections, single HBoV infection rarely results in severe clinical outcomes, and HBoV sequencing data appears to support conserved genomes across strains identified in this study."

CD011926,0,16948979,0,[False negative diagnosis of HIV-1].,"We report a case of a false negative diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in an African girl. Two HIV-1 DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were negative at the second and fourth months of life. Because anti-HIV antibodies persisted when the patient was 18 months old, the HIV-1 RNA PCR test was performed with a positive result, confirming HIV-1 non-B subtype, recombinant A-G. The prevalence of non-B HIV-1 subtypes are increasing in Spain, which could be related to the phenomenon of immigration. Approximately one-third of HIV-infected foreigners have non-B subtypes and the percentage increases to 70 % of the African population in Spain. In non-B HIV-1 subtypes, false negative results and inconsistencies between viral load and CD4 count are more frequent. These subtypes also show a higher rate of resistance to protease inhibitors, which can have therapeutic implications."

Follow-up was 2 years unless death or relapse occurred. CMV-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was programmed weekly until month +3 post-HSCT. Immunomonitoring consisted of sequential lymphocyte subset enumerations and analyses of T-cell proliferative and γ-interferon responses to CMV and to adenovirus. In the 108 recipients, the 2-year relapse rate (RR) was 25% (median time to onset 4·5 months; range: 24 d-17 months). CMV reactivation occurrence was 31% (median time to onset 26 d). Donor/recipient CMV serostatus did not influence RR. Among the 89 recipients disease-free after day +120, i) early CMV-reactivation before day +30 was more frequent (P = 0·01) in the relapse recipient group opposed to the non-relapse group. ii) CD8(+) /CD28(-) and CD4(+) CD45RA(-) T-cell expansions induced by CMV did not influence RR, iii) Recovery of anti-CMV and also anti-adenovirus immunity and of naïve CD4(+) T-cells was faster in the non-relapse group (P = 0·008; 0·009 and 0·002 respectively). In contrast to adult acute myeloid leukaemia, CMV reactivation was associated with increased RR in this paediatric series. Accelerated overall immune recovery rather than CMV-driven immunity had a favourable impact on RR."

CD011926,0,9033982,0,Antiretroviral therapy: evaluating the new era in HIV treatment.,"Tools for evaluating antiretroviral therapy are still evolving. Key components are available such as the laboratory assays themselves, but results from these assays are being analyzed and presented inconsistently, making interstudy comparisons difficult or impossible. In part, the problems in analysis and presentation reflect a lack of completed clinical trials in which new laboratory methods such as RNA copy numbers can be validated. Survival is the clearest valid end point in clinical trials of antiretroviral drugs. Beyond life and death, the next most important issue is quality of life. Because of the difficulty in agreeing what ""quality of life"" means, and the even greater problems measuring such an abstract concept, in most cases assessments are made of more quantifiable clinical elements: cognitive and motor function, growth, and the frequency of opportunistic infections. Laboratory markers of disease progression are very quantifiable but have meaning only when they predict clinical outcome. There is a consensus that CD4+ counts, CD4+ percentages, and HIV copy numbers measured by RNA PCR are important. There is not, however, a consensus approach to interpretation of data from any of these markers of HIV disease, particularly because the interpretation may vary based on the patient's level of clinical disease. With time and more clinical trials with which to clarify their use, these tools should become more uniformly applied, at which point cross-study comparisons might be possible. Progress is already being made in the development of new antiretroviral therapies, and with improved evaluation techniques the evolution of new anti-HIV treatments should become an even more efficient process."
CD011926,0,20920896,0,Improved early diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by real-time PCR to prevent chronic colonisation in a paediatric cystic fibrosis population.,"Early detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in children with cystic fibrosis is hampered by the need to process a sub-optimal specimen type, namely cough swabs, which are known to have a lower positive yield than sputa or more invasive samples. This delay in the detection of low levels of P. aeruginosa could potentially result in the loss of an opportunity to initiate early aggressive antibiotic therapy and result in chronic colonisation, with a poorer overall prognosis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) offers an opportunity to increase the detection rate of P. aeruginosa compared to traditional culture techniques. This study examined 500 cough swabs and 42 sputum samples from paediatric patients and showed that detection of P. aeruginosa could be increased in both sample types by 100% and 45% respectively. Overall the sensitivity was 100% and specificity of 58% when compared to culture as a gold standard. These results although initially promising require careful consideration both from a treatment and infection control standpoint as the significance of detection of very low levels of P. aeruginosa is unclear."
CD011926,0,21614511,0,Screening of congenital cytomegalovirus infection by real-time PCR in urine pools.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most frequent cause of congenital infection. Despite the fact that 5-17% of asymptomatic infected babies will develop late sequelae and, therefore, should be closely followed, most of these children will remain undetected, as screening of all newborns by viral culture is too expensive and no valid alternative has been widely accepted. The aim of this work was to demonstrate that pool testing can be used to screen HCMV congenital infection in newborns. For this purpose, a real-time PCR technique was tested in urine pools. This pool method was applied to all urine specimens from children received in the virology laboratory of the Centro Hospitalar Cova da Beira for diagnosis of HCMV infection for a period of 14 months. Ten out of the 160 urine samples were tested positive by shell-vial culture and were also detected by this pool method. Additionally, 100 urine specimens, collected in 2004 and culture negative for HCMV were included to test the specificity of this methodology, all of which were negative. In conclusion, these results suggest that urine pools can be used to detect HCMV-positive urines in children, with similar sensitivity and specificity when compared with the standard method. Because of the very significant reduction both in terms of labour and cost of testing materials, this methodology may represent a valid option for screening the HCMV congenital infection in newborns."

We are reporting the first point-of-care evaluation of the SOFIA™-RSV rapid test. In the Charité Influenza-Like Disease Cohort, 686 nasopharyngeal samples were tested in parallel with SOFIA™-RSV and SOFIA™-Influenza A+B. Compared to real-time PCR, SOFIA™-RSV sensitivities/specificities were 78.6%/93.9%, respectively (SOFIA™-Influenza A: 80.6%/99.3%). Performance was greatest in patients below 2 years of age with a test sensitivity of 81.8%. RSV sensitivities were highest (85%) in the first 2 days of illness and with nasopharyngeal compared to nasal swabs (P=0.055, McNemar's test).

CD011926,0,19431959,0,The use of Perioscan as a potential screening test for mothers at risk for delivery of pre-term and low birth-weight infants.,"Increased levels of oestrogen and progesterone during pregnancy may lead to periodontal disease. The anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria classified as the ""red complex"" (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) are frequently associated with periodontal disease. Periodontopathogens produce toxins and enzymes that can enter the bloodstream and cross the placenta to harm the foetus. The response of the mother's immune system to infection by these periodontopathogens brings about the release of inflammatory mediators which may trigger preterm labour or result in low birth-weight infants. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of Perioscan as a potential screening test for mothers at risk for pre-term delivery of low birth weight infants due to periodontal disease. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from pregnant women between the ages of 17 to 45 years attending an ante-natal clinic in the Western Cape in South Africa. Plaque samples were analyzed by the enzymatic Perioscan test for detection of the red complex in 372 sites from 66 women. Results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of the three species of the red complex. Seventeen (25.75%) of the population group tested positive with Perioscan but only 27 (7.25%) of the 372 sites were positive. Of the 66 mothers examined, we managed to retrieve 29 records post-delivery. In all the mothers examined, Perioscan results showed an association with the indices used to diagnose periodontal disease, and could also be associated with preterm delivery of low birth-weight infants in two of the 29 maternal records recovered."

A total of 16 isolates were recovered from 16 babies hospitalized in the ward during the period 1 to 16 July. All these babies developed diarrhea, and three of them developed septicemia. All the isolates demonstrated resistance to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime due to the production of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides (kanamycin, tobramycin, netilmicin, gentamicin, and amikacin) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. DNA profiles were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using the XbaI and SpeI endonucleases and by ribotyping with PstI digestion. They yielded the same patterns, showing that the outbreak was caused by a single clone. The ESBL was identified as CTX-M-27 by sequencing of PCR products and by isoelectric focusing. The ESBL resistance was transferred by a 40-kb conjugative plasmid. The mobile insertion sequence ISEcp1 was found to be located upstream of bla(CTX-M-27) in the same position as that known for a bla(CTX-M-14) sequence. A new gene named dfrA21, encoding resistance to trimethoprim and carried by a 90-kb plasmid, was characterized. The dfrA21 gene was inserted as a single resistance cassette in a class I integron. The babies were treated with colistin, and all except two recovered. The outbreak came to an end when appropriate actions were taken: patient isolation, hand washing, and disinfection of the ward."

Clinical information and molecular characteristics of 130 cases were analyzed. Up to 83.8% patients were affected with late-onset infection. Cesarean delivery was the main delivery route, accounting for 74.6% of the total deliveries. Pneumonia (69, 53.1%) was the most common infection. A total of 38 patients (29.2%) suffered from complications. Moreover, 35 cases (26.9%) were invasive infections, among which 88.6% involved multiple organs and 45.7% suffered from complications. Cesarean section and premature birth were the risk factors for invasive CA-MRSA infection. ST59-MRSA-SCCmecIVa-t437 (54, 41.5%) was the most predominant CA-MRSA clone. The hla expression in the ST59 isolates was higher than that in ST910 (p = 0.02) and the hla expression in ST59-SCCmecV-t437 was higher than that in ST59-SCCmecIVa-t437. Approximately, 46.4% (13/28) of the infections caused by ST59-SCCmecV were invasive. This value is higher than that of ST59-SCCmecVa caused infections (14/59, 23.7%) (p = 0.03). This study showed that neonatal CA-MRSA infections in China readily become invasive, involve multiple organs, and are often accompanied by complications.

There has been no analysis of factors associated with the risk of acquisition of ESBLs in neonates in an intensive care unit from northern India. The CTX-M ESBL enzymes impart resistance against advanced generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefotaxime) and CTX-M variants have become the most prevalent ESBLs worldwide. The CTX-M-15 enzyme in particular is increasingly being reported from Escherichia coli isolates from northern India together with TEM-1. Moreover, E. coli is the most common cause of neonatal sepsis. Accordingly, this study aimed to: (i) characterize the mode of transmission of bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM) among ESBL-producing E. coli strains isolated from patients admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and (ii) identify factors associated with the acquisition of the said strains in male and female neonates. A total of 97 ESBL-producers was identified among 266 E. coli strains isolated from 238 neonates. The isolates were screened for bla(CTX-M), bla(TEM), armA, rmtA and rmtB, the last three genes being responsible for aminoglycoside resistance. PCR amplified bla(CTX-M) genes were cloned and sequenced. Five bla(CTX-M-15), two rmtB, two bla(TEM-1) and thirteen class1 integrons were detected. All the bla(CTX-M-15) positive isolates, except one, were clonally related. Both univariate and multivariate analyses of factors for the acquisition of the said strains were performed with respect to the sex of the neonates. 'Length of stay in the NICU' was found to be the single independent factor associated with ESBL acquisition. In conclusion, our data suggest that male neonates who are colonized or infected by ESBL-producing E. coli have a longer stay in the NICU compared to their female counterparts. This prolonged stay may be due to male neonates becoming colonized/infected earlier than their female counterparts. Plasmid-mediated-conjugal transfer was found to be the mechanism of transfer of the bla(CTX-M-15) resistance marker in the described setting."
CD011926,0,14551882,0,Molecular characterization of serotype III group B-streptococcus isolates causing neonatal meningitis.,"We studied a collection of 110 serotype III group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates causing neonatal meningitis, by means of both pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI and Southern hybridization with probes for genes potentially associated with virulence (neuA, cpsA, scpB, and hylB and, for mobile genetic elements [MGEs], GBSi1 and IS1548), in comparison with 44 serotype III GBS isolates colonizing healthy neonates. Using polymerase chain reaction, we assessed both the insertion of MGEs downstream of the scpB gene and the insertion of IS1548 within the hylB gene. PFGE clustered the isolates into 3 main groups. One PFGE group accounted for 80% of typeable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isolates, versus 24% of colonization isolates (P=1.8 x 10-9). GBSi1 was found in 67% of CSF isolates and in only 23% of colonization isolates (P=5.3 x 10-7). A 15-kbp SmaI restriction-DNA fragment bearing the neuA gene was significantly associated with CSF isolates (P=1.1 x 10-11)."
CD011926,0,21430103,0,Replacing traditional diagnostics of fecal viral pathogens by a comprehensive panel of real-time PCRs.,"Molecular DNA-based diagnostics are increasingly being used for diagnosis of viral infections. For enteric viruses, PCR assays have also been developed. The aims of this study were to compile and evaluate a comprehensive panel of PCR assays for diagnosis of viruses causing diarrheal disease and to evaluate its use in a largely pediatric population in a 750-bed university medical center. The PCR panel was designed to include assays for detection of adenovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus, norovirus, parechovirus, rotavirus, and sapovirus. The results of the PCR panel were evaluated in relation to conventional viral diagnostics consisting of viral culture and/or rotavirus and adenovirus rapid antigen tests on samples that were taken for routine diagnostics. Comparing conventional with PCR-based testing, the number of viruses detected increased dramatically from 25 to 106 when PCR assays were used. This increase was due mainly to detection of previously undetected viruses, i.e., astrovirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. In 24% of the samples, norovirus was detected. Also, the lower detection limit of PCR-based adenovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and rotavirus diagnostics further increased the detection rate. By focusing on samples from patients with complaints of gastroenteritis, detection of a causative agent was increased from 49% by conventional tests to 97% by molecular diagnostics. However, many samples containing low viral loads were found in patients with complaints other than intestinal complaints. In conclusion, the proposed comprehensive PCR panel with appropriate cutoff values can be used for sensitive, rapid, and clinically relevant diagnosis of gastrointestinal viruses."

We screened approximately 90% of gravidas in the Prefecture and > 90% of the seropositive women agreed not to breast-feed. The maternal transmission rate dropped from approximately 20% to approximately 3%. PCR of cord bloods showed that 2.5% were PCR-positive. However, among formula-fed children, none of the cord-positives seroconverted, and none of the seropositives tested had been cord-positive. Breast-feeding for less than six months decreased the transmission rate significantly, but may have a higher transmission rate than the formula feeding."

A matched case-control study implicated imported coquina clams complying with European Union shellfish standards as the source of infection; this implication was confirmed by the detection by reverse transcription-PCR of hepatitis A virus (HAV) RNA in shellfish samples. In spite of the recognized low variability of HAV, genetic characterization of the complete capsid region of virus isolates from patient serum samples revealed the existence of both synonymous and nonsynonymous variants. Two antigenic variants were detected, one in a discontinuous epitope defined by monoclonal antibody K3-4C8 and a second in a linear VP1 epitope of the virus. In spite of these antigenic variants, all isolates were assigned to genotype IB, providing further evidence that the outbreak originated from a common source, although multiple strains were likely to be involved."

CD011926,0,26418350,0,Determination of cut-off cycle threshold values in routine RT-PCR assays to assist differential diagnosis of norovirus in children hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis.,"Norovirus (NV) is an important cause of acute gastroenteritis in children, but is also frequently detected in asymptomatic children, which complicates the interpretation of NV detection results in both the clinical setting and population prevalence studies. A total of 807 faecal samples from children aged <5 years hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis were collected in Thai Binh, Vietnam, from January 2011 to September 2012. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect and quantify NV-RNA in clinical samples. A bimodal distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) values was observed in which the lower peak was assumed to represent cases for which NV was the causal agent of diarrhoea, whereas the higher peak was assumed to represent cases involving an alternative pathogen other than NV. Under these assumptions, we applied finite-mixture modelling to estimate a threshold of Ct <21·36 (95% confidence interval 20·29-22·46) to distinguish NV-positive patients for which NV was the likely cause of diarrhoea. We evaluated the validity of the threshold through comparisons with NV antigen ELISA results, and comparisons of Ct values in patients co-infected with rotavirus. We conclude that the use of an appropriate cut-off value in the interpretation of NV real-time RT-PCR results may improve differential diagnosis of enteric infections, and could contribute to improved estimates of the burden of NV disease."
CD011926,0,8139047,0,Role of alveolar type II cells and of surfactant-associated protein C mRNA levels in the pathogenesis of respiratory distress in mink kits infected with Aleutian mink disease parvovirus.,"Neonatal mink kits infected with Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (ADV) develop an acute interstitial pneumonia with clinical symptoms and pathological lesions that resemble those seen in preterm human infants with respiratory distress syndrome and in human adults with adult respiratory distress syndrome. We have previously suggested that ADV replicates in the alveolar type II epithelial cells of the lung. By using double in situ hybridization, with the simultaneous use of a probe to detect ADV replication and a probe to demonstrate alveolar type II cells, we now confirm this hypothesis. Furthermore, Northern (RNA) blot hybridization showed that the infection caused a significant decrease of surfactant-associated protein C mRNA produced by the alveolar type II cells. We therefore suggest that the severe clinical symptoms and pathological changes characterized by hyaline membrane formation observed in ADV-infected mink kits are caused by a dysfunction of alveolar surfactant similar to that observed in respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. However, in the infected mink kits the dysfunction is due to the replication of ADV in the lungs, whereas the dysfunction of surfactant in preterm infants is due to lung immaturity."

Preliminary data.,"To evaluate the usefulness of conventional serological methods with western blot assay (WB) in congenital toxoplasmosis diagnosis, we prospectively enrolled in a clinical and serological follow-up all pregnant women with Toxoplasma gondii infection and their offspring, referred to us from October 2004. Western blot and standard serological test were performed on sera collected from mother during pregnancy and from mother and child at birth, at postpartum month 1-3-6-9 and 12. At this point in time, 22 pregnant women and 14 infants have completed the follow-up. 4 newborns were infected and 2 had specific toxoplasmosis anomalies at the birth. In mothers without seroconversion, the WB performed during pregnancy demonstrates the highest accordance with postnatal follow-up whereas in 1 case the negative result of PCR analysis was not confirmed by postnatal observation. The detection of anti-T gondii IgG against 8 kDa accessory antigenic band and against the accessory band included between 35 and 40 kDa band in immunoblot assay was useful for diagnosis of acute phase but did not improve the evaluation of comparative postnatal profile. Althougth few infants have concluded the postnatal follow-up, the preliminary results showed a greater value of using a IgM and IgA WB test than other standard method for the early diagnosis of toxoplasmosis at birth also in child born to treated mothers.

CD011926,0,20185547,0,Transmission of a Klebsiella pneumoniae clone harbouring genes for CTX-M-15-like and SHV-112 enzymes in a neonatal intensive care unit of a Kuwaiti hospital.,"The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become a large problem in most countries including Kuwait. This antibiotic resistance is usually due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes such as SHV, TEM and CTX-M. This study reports the emergence and spread of an ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae clone in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in a Kuwaiti hospital. Eight ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates were from blood cultures of seven neonates, and two were from the fingers of two healthcare workers in a NICU in Al Jahra Hospital, Kuwait. All isolates were obtained in February-March 2006, except for one, which was obtained in August 2005. Identification of the bacteria was based on traditional bacteriological and biochemical tests using the Vitek system. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by the disc diffusion method using 16 different antibiotics. ESBLs were detected using disc approximation and double-disc synergy methods and confirmed as ESBLs using Etest. PCR and DNA sequencing were performed to determine the genotypes and mutations in the beta-lactamase genes (blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M). Genetic relatedness was determined by PFGE. All isolates were confirmed to have ESBLs by the Vitek system, disc approximation test, double-disc diffusion test and Etest, being resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, gentamicin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin but susceptible to tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Molecular studies showed the isolates to have TEM-1 beta-lactamase, a CTX-M-15-like ESBL and the newly discovered SHV-112 ESBL. PFGE showed that all isolates had identical banding patterns. The results indicate that a single clone of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae caused bloodstream infections among babies in a NICU of a Kuwaiti hospital, and may have emerged at least 5 years ago. This clone was also present on the hands of healthcare workers, suggesting that they may have been involved in its transmission. Further studies are recommended to determine whether this clone is also spreading in other Kuwaiti hospitals."

Swab samples from the floors of these facilities were also analyzed to determine the extent of environmental contamination by this organism. C. difficile was found in the stool of only one of 40 neonates during the normal 1-week stay in the hospital after delivery. The isolate from the neonate was identical to that of her mother, as determined by PCR ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis, and toxin gene type, suggesting that the C. difficile-positive neonate acquired the organism from her mother rather than from the environment. By contrast, 47 (48.0%) of the 98 infants and children, comprising 50 enrolled in two day-nurseries who were >= 3 years old and 48 enrolled in a kindergarten who were 2-5 years old, carried C. difficile. The carriage rate in infants under 2 years of age was much higher (84.4%) than in children 2 years old and older (30.3%). When analyzed according to age group, the carriage rates were 100, 75.0, 45.5, 24.0, 38.5, and 23.5% in infants and children 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years old, respectively. The observation that several children were colonized with the same type of C. difficile strain in each day-care facility, and that the floors of day-nursery A and kindergarten C were contaminated with C. difficile strains identical to those colonizing the intestines of children enrolled in those facilities suggests that cross-infection of C. difficile among children occurs through C. difficile-carrying children or their contaminated environments."

CD011926,0,9194271,0,A marginal regression modelling framework for evaluating medical diagnostic tests.,"Technological advances continue to develop for early detection of disease. Research studies are required to define the statistical properties of such screening or diagnostic tests. However, statistical methodology currently used to evaluate diagnostic tests is limited. We propose the use of marginal regression models with robust sandwich variance estimators to make inference about the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. This method is more flexible than standard methods in that it allows comparison of sensitivity between two or more tests even if all tests are not carried out on all subjects, it can accommodate correlated data, and the effect of covariates can be evaluated. This last feature is important since it allows researchers to understand the effects on sensitivity and specificity of various environmental and patient characteristics. If such factors are under the control of the clinician, it provides the opportunity to modify the diagnostic testing program to maximize sensitivity and/or specificity. We show that the marginal regression modelling methods generalize standard statistical methods. In particular, when we compare two screening tests and we test each subject with both screens, the method corresponds to McNemar's test. We describe data from an ongoing audiology screening study and we analyse a simulated version of the data to illustrate the methodology. We also analyse data from a longitudinal study of PCR as a diagnostic test for cytomegalovirus."

The putative diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) were investigated for susceptibility to various antibiotics. Overall, 61 E. coli isolates were classified as enteroaggregative E. coli (29 isolates), atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (22 isolates), enterotoxigenic E. coli (8 isolates), and verotoxin-producing E. coli (1 isolate), and one isolate was categorized as unconventional DEC. Only 8 of the PCR-positive isolates would have been assumed to be pathogenic based on their O antigenicity, which highlights the limited effectiveness of serotyping. More than a half (51%) of the pathogenic isolates expressed a multidrug-resistant phenotype, which raises concerns about the therapeutic pediatric approach. The DEC isolates were heterogeneous phylogenetically, deriving from all four major groups: A (31 isolates), B2 (14 isolates), B1 (10 isolates), and D (6 isolates), respectively. Thus, the phylogenetic descent was less significant than the virulence gene content. Our findings document the importance of DEC as a cause of childhood diarrhea in Romania, providing evidence that efforts should be made to estimate the burden of infections by etiology for a better medical approach."
CD011926,0,24440286,0,Thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis: On the search for a pathogen signature.,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mainly mediated by anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies. In the late onset, a thymoma, tumor of the thymus, is quite frequent. However, the events leading to thymoma and MG are not understood. As thymoma-associated MG (MG-T) patients also display anti-interferon type I (IFN-I) neutralizing antibodies, we investigated if MG-T could be associated with an anti-viral signature. RT-PCR analyses demonstrated huge increases of IFN-I subtypes, IFN-α2, -α8, -ω and -β, in thymoma-associated MG but not in thymomas without MG or in control thymuses. Next, we investigated if dsRNA signaling pathway involvement could be observed in MG-T, as recently observed in early-onset MG. We observed an abnormal regulation of dsRNA-sensing molecules with an increase of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), and a decrease of protein kinase R (PKR) and dsRNA helicases (RIG-I and MDA5) in thymoma from MG patients. We also detected a decreased expression of p53, the tumor suppressor that is known to be down-regulated by dsRNA. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that MG-T could be linked to a viral infection. As p16 (CDKN2A), a marker of HPV infections, was up-regulated in MG-T, we thus screened DNA from thymomas for human papillomavirus (HPV) by real-time PCR using HPV consensus SPF10 primers. RT-PCR results were negative for all samples tested. We confirmed the absence of HPV DNA detection by end point PCR using FAP primers to amplify a larger panel of HPV genotypes. Our data clearly demonstrate INF-I overexpression together with the activation of innate immunity pathways in thymoma-associated MG suggesting that MG might develop after a pathogen infection. We were not able to relate thymoma to HPV infections and the implication of other pathogens is discussed."

Placentas and corresponding neonatal tissues in 21 consecutive cases of idiopathic spontaneous abortion or perinatal death, before or within 2 days of birth, were tested for an infectious agent. The controls included 10 consecutive cases of fetal and placental tissues from therapeutic abortions, 5 placentas from unremarkable childbirths, and 11 placentas from cases of spontaneous abortion or perinatal death of known cause (ruptured uterus, placenta abruption, prolapsed cord). An intrauterine infection was noted in 16 of 21 (76%) of the placentas associated with neonatal mortality; in each case, the same infectious agent was found in the neonatal tissues, primarily the spleen. The most common infectious agent was enterovirus/coxsackie virus (10 cases); the histologic findings in the placenta were nonspecific. There was strong expression of TNF-alpha in the placenta and spleen of each of the cases of intrauterine infection and in none of the 26 controls.

Samples of 3,172 stools from cases of gastroenteritis in children aged under 7 years sent to the Bristol Public Health Laboratory over the 1999/2000 winter 'season' were tested prospectively by EM, EIA and RT-PCR. The results from sporadic cases were compared with 1,360 samples from 285 outbreaks of gastroenteritis which were sent to the laboratory over the same period. In total NLV was established as the causal agent in 326 cases (10.3%) of sporadic gastroenteritis by one or more of the tests (EM 30 (0.9%), EIA 132 (4.2%) and RT-PCR 276 (8.7%)). The presence of other enteric viruses was established using EM and rotavirus EIA. Rotaviruses were the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis with 684 cases (21.6%). Other viruses detected included, adenovirus 124 cases (3.9%), astrovirus 97 cases (3.1%) and calicivirus in 7 cases (0.2%).

CD011926,0,14695673,0,Evidence of human metapneumovirus in children in Argentina.,"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a virus, which was first associated with acute lower respiratory infection in children but is detected currently in all age groups. Clinical symptoms are similar to those described for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, ranging from mild respiratory illness to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children. To date, no cases of hMPV have been reported in Argentina. In this study, 440 respiratory samples obtained during the period 1998-2002 from children under 5 years old with acute respiratory infection were evaluated. Routine detection for RSV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza was undertaken by immunofluorescent assay. Of the samples negative for these viruses, only 100 were available. All these samples were tested for hMPV by RT-PCR using primers for the L gene. Eleven out of 100 (11%) respiratory samples were positive for hMPV by RT-PCR. A higher frequency of detection was observed in spring. hMPV was detected in all the years studied, except in 2001. Ten out of 11 children positive for hMPV were hospitalized. Median age was 5 months. Of seven patients, five (71%) required oxygen supplementation. The most frequent diagnosis was bronchiolitis (86%), sometimes accompanied by conjunctivitis and otitis media. The present study showed that hMPV was associated with acute lower respiratory infections in children in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This evidence strongly suggests that hMPV is a common pathogen with a wide geographical distribution, which should be included in the routine diagnosis of respiratory viruses in young children."

In the present study, we analyzed the role of enterovirus infections in a Finnish birth cohort study, Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP), in which all newborn infants are screened for diabetes-associated HLA-DQB1 alleles, and those with an increased genetic risk are invited for prospective follow-up. Enterovirus infections were diagnosed by serology and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from serum samples taken from birth every 3-6 months. Case children included 41 infants who became positive for diabetes-associated autoantibodies during the observation. Control children comprised altogether 196 infants who remained autoantibody negative and were matched for the time of birth, sex, and HLA-DQB1 alleles. Enterovirus infections were more frequent in case children than in control children (P = 0.004), and the average enterovirus antibody levels were also higher in the case children (P = 0.003). Enterovirus infections were particularly frequent during the 6-month period preceding the first detection of autoantibodies: 51% of the case children compared with 28% of the control children had an infection in that time interval (P = 0.003). There was no difference in the frequency of adenovirus infections between the groups (P = 0.9). The present results imply that enterovirus infections are associated with the appearance of beta-cell autoantibodies. A possible causal relationship is supported by the clustering of infections to the time when autoantibodies appeared."

In all newborns with positive screening results, plasma and dried blood spots (DBS) collected at birth were tested additionally for CMV DNA. Congenital CMV infection was confirmed by virus isolation from a urine sample collected within the first 2 weeks of life. Congenital CMV infection was identified in four out of 2,841 newborns tested (incidence 0.14%; 95% CI, 0.05-0.39%).

More than 90% of the children infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa. Most children infected with HIV contract the infection in utero, during delivery, or via breast milk. This review outlines the current diagnostic methods to determine the HIV status of infants born to HIV-infected mothers. The HIV DNA and RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are highly accurate and are recommended as the first-choice diagnostic methods. However, they are expensive and require complex laboratory procedures. Consequently, a search for less costly and complicated methods has led to the testing of p24 antigen analyses as an alternative to the gold-standard PCR tests, with encouraging results. The p24 antigen Perkin Elmer assay currently most often used has a sensitivity of 98.8% and a specificity of 100% (infants 6 weeks of age).

CD011926,0,15356934,0,The prevention and management of congenital syphilis: an overview and recommendations.,"The continued occurrence of congenital syphilis is an indictment of the inadequate antenatal care services and poor quality of programmes to control sexually transmitted infections. More than 1 million infants are born with congenital syphilis each year. Despite national policies on antenatal testing and the widespread use of antenatal services, syphilis screening is still implemented only sporadically in many countries, leaving the disease undetected and untreated among many pregnant women. The weak organization of services and the costs of screening are the principal obstacles facing programmes. Decentralization of antenatal syphilis screening programmes, on-site testing and immediate treatment can reduce the number of cases of congenital syphilis. Antenatal syphilis screening and treatment programmes are as cost effective as many existing public health programmes, e.g. measles immunization. Diagnosis of congenital syphilis is problematic since more than half of all infants are asymptomatic, and signs in symptomatic infants may be subtle and nonspecific. Newer diagnostic tests such as enzyme immunoassays, polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting have made diagnosis more sensitive and specific but are largely unavailable in the settings where they are most needed. Guidelines developed for better-resourced settings are conservative and err on the side of overtreatment. They are difficult to implement in, or inappropriate for, poorly-resourced settings because of the lack of investigative ability and the pressure on health facilities to discharge infants early. This paper offers recommendations for treating infants, including an approach based solely on maternal serological status and clinical signs of syphilis in the infant."

CD011926,0,8182161,0,Involvement of cyclic AMP and nitric oxide in immunoglobulin E-dependent activation of Fc epsilon RII/CD23+ normal human keratinocytes.,"Epidermal keratinocytes (EK) are exposed to multiple inflammatory stimuli and paracrine factors secreted by various dermal cells (lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophages, fibroblasts) during wounding, cutaneous allergy, and infections. We have previously demonstrated that after stimulation with interleukin 4 or interferon-gamma, human EK express the low-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RII/CD23) on their surface. In the present study, we showed that the ligation of CD23 by IgE/anti-IgE immune complexes or specific monoclonal antibody induces a dose-dependent release of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha from EK. CD23-ligation activates the nitric oxide-dependent pathway, as demonstrated by the high levels of nitrites released in cell supernatants, and the accumulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotides in EK. These second messengers are required for IgE-dependent stimulation of cytokine production by these cells, inasmuch as this is completely abolished by the use of cAMP or nitric oxide synthase antagonists. Human epithelial keratinocytes may thus participate in IgE-mediated immune responses, through their ability to express functional CD23 antigen."

CD011926,0,9749400,0,A hospital outbreak of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae investigated by RAPD typing and analysis of the genetics and mechanisms of resistance.,"Between July and September 1997 a ceftazidime- and aminoglycoside-resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae infected or colonized seven patients on three paediatric wards at Guy's Hospital in London. The patients were mostly neonates or infants recovering from cardiac surgery for congenital defects. The organism was probably introduced by an asymptomatic patient from Greece and the subsequent outbreak could largely be explained by person-to-person spread on individual wards and frequent transfers of patients between wards. The outbreak was controlled by patient isolation and attention to handwashing, and there were no fatalities. The organisms were non-typeable by serology but had a characteristic RAPD profile. They produced the extended spectrum beta-lactamase SHV-5 and the aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes AAC(6') + probably AAC(3)II, encoded on a conjugative plasmid of approximately 160 kb. Two other patients had multi-resistant klebsiellas, one of them an SHV-5 producer and one a TEM-5 producer, but these could be distinguished from each other and from the outbreak strain by serological and RAPD typing and by the genetics and mechanisms of their resistances. Three other multi-resistant enterobacteria were isolated during the outbreak: an Escherichia coli that had acquired the 160 kb resistance plasmid from the epidemic klebsiella, a Citrobacter isolated from one of the patients with the klebsiella but which did not produce SHV-5, and a TEM-5-producing Enterobacter. This outbreak illustrates the importance of screening patients from high-risk areas for multiply-resistant organisms on admission, and the value of bacterial typing and analysis of resistance mechanisms to define the epidemiology of hospital infection."

This study prospectively evaluated newborns of mothers living in the municipality of Paracatu, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The infants were followed up at 6-month intervals by clinical examination, serological tests (immunofluorescence [IIF] and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with rK39 [ELISA-rK39]) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) until they had completed 18 months of age. A total of 166 pregnant women were included to evaluate the possible transfer of antibodies or even congenital transmission. Twenty-two of the women tested positive by IIF, four by ELISA-rK39, and one by PCR. Three infants of the 25 women with some positive test results were also positive in the first test (one by IIF, one by ELISA-rK39, and the third by ELISA-rK39 and PCR). One hundred and sixty infants were included in the study; of these, 43 had at least one positive sample over time. However, agreement between tests was low. Follow-up of children with a positive result in the tests studied revealed no progression to classical disease within a period of 18 months. In contrast, two children with negative IIF, PCR, and ELISA-rK39 results developed classical VL at 9 and 12 months of age. In conclusion, a positive test result was variable and sometimes temporary and agreement between tests was low. Therefore, the early diagnosis of Leishmania infection was not associated with the early identification of cases that would progress to classical VL in the endemic area studied."

It highlights the epidemiological features of this transmission mode for the three main congenital parasitic infections due to Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium sp. Information on the possible maternal-fetal routes of transmission, the placental responses to infection and timing of parasite transmission are synthesized and compared. The factors susceptible to be involved in parasite transmission and development of congenital parasitic diseases, such as the parasite genotypes, the maternal co-infections and parasitic load, the immunological features of pregnant women and the capacity of some fetuses/neonates to overcome their immunological immaturity to mount an immune response against the transmitted parasites are also discussed and compared. Analysis of clinical data indicates that parasitic congenital infections are often asymptomatic, whereas symptomatic newborns generally display non-specific symptoms. The long-term consequences of congenital infections are also mentioned, such as the imprinting of neonatal immune system and the possible trans-generational transmission. The detection of infection in pregnant women is mainly based on standard serological or parasitological investigations. Amniocentesis and cordocentesis can be used for the detection of some fetal infections. The neonatal infection can be assessed using parasitological, molecular or immunological methods; the place of PCR in such neonatal diagnosis is discussed. When such laboratory diagnosis is not possible at birth or in the first weeks of life, standard serological investigations can also be performed 8-10 months after birth, to avoid detection of maternal transmitted antibodies. The specific aspects of treatment of T. gondii, T. cruzi and Plasmodium congenital infections are mentioned. The possibilities of primary and secondary prophylaxes, as well as the available WHO corresponding recommendations are also presented."

There is also the quest for discovery of 'novel' biomarkers to assist diagnosis and prognosis of neonatal diseases using powerful mass-screening techniques, e.g. the next-generation sequencing, proteomics and arrays. This article aims to introduce the concept of the next generation of biomarkers to practising neonatal clinicians, and, hopefully, to integrate basic science research into day-to-day clinical practice in the future."

Currently, the forensic standard for diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infections is culture. In adults, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are superior to culture for CT, but these tests have been insufficiently evaluated in pediatric populations for forensic purposes."

CD011926,0,25996916,0,Blood-Stage Parasitaemia and Age Determine Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Gametocytaemia in Papua New Guinea.,"A better understanding of human-to-mosquito transmission is crucial to control malaria. In order to assess factors associated with gametocyte carriage, 2083 samples were collected in a cross-sectional survey in Papua New Guinea. Plasmodium species were detected by light microscopy and qPCR and gametocytes by detection of pfs25 and pvs25 mRNA transcripts by reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). The parasite prevalence by PCR was 18.5% for Plasmodium falciparum and 13.0% for P. vivax. 52.5% of all infections were submicroscopic. Gametocytes were detected in 60% of P. falciparum-positive and 51% of P. vivax-positive samples. Each 10-fold increase in parasite density led to a 1.8-fold and 3.3-fold increase in the odds of carrying P. falciparum and P. vivax gametocytes. Thus the proportion of gametocyte positive and gametocyte densities was highest in young children carrying high asexual parasite densities and in symptomatic individuals. Dilution series of gametocytes allowed absolute quantification of gametocyte densities by qRT-PCR and showed that pvs25 expression is 10-20 fold lower than pfs25 expression. Between 2006 and 2010 parasite prevalence in the study site has decreased by half. 90% of the remaining infections were asymptomatic and likely constitute an important reservoir of transmission. However, mean gametocyte densities were low (approx. 1-2 gametocyte/μL) and it remains to be determined to what extent low-density gametocyte positive individuals are infective to mosquitos."
CD011926,0,2230714,0,"Urogenital, maternal and neonatal isolates of Haemophilus influenzae: identification of unusually virulent serologically non-typable clone families and evidence for a new Haemophilus species.","A collection of 117 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, including 112 non-typable isolates recovered predominantly in the USA and France from genital, obstetric and neonatal sources, was characterized by the electrophoretic mobilities of 10 metabolic enzymes. Eighty-six distinctive multilocus chromosomal genotypes (electrophoretic types, ETs) were distinguished on the basis of allele profiles at the enzyme loci. Isolates of five allied biotype IV ETs were highly divergent from all other strains and hybridization of chromosomal DNA revealed that they undoubtedly represent a previously unrecognized species of Haemophilus. Isolates representing these ETs were recovered predominantly from obstetric infections and serious neonatal diseases and apparently possess specific tropism for the genital tract. Strains of these five ETs were present in samples from both the USA and France, but only in the USA did they cause bacteraemia and meningitis, an occurrence which probably reflects differences in patient management between the two countries. Although strains assigned to H. influenzae (sensu stricto) were strongly polymorphic in multilocus enzyme genotype, 69% of isolates recovered from patients with meningitis and/or septicaemia were assigned to only two clone families, a result suggesting that some serologically nontypable strains of H. influenzae originating from the genital tract are unusually virulent."

CD011926,0,22130802,0,Neonatal screening for severe primary immunodeficiency diseases using high-throughput triplex real-time PCR.,"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) are inborn errors of immune function that require prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent life-threatening infections. The lack of functional T or B lymphocytes in these diseases serves as a diagnostic criterion and can be applied to neonatal screening. A robust triplex PCR method for quantitation of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and κ-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs), using a single Guthrie card punch, was developed and validated in a cohort of 2560 anonymized newborn screening cards and in 49 original stored Guthrie cards from patients diagnosed with SCID, XLA, ataxia-telangiectasia, Nijmegen-breakage-syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency, immunoglobulin A deficiency, or X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome. Simultaneous measurement of TREC and KREC copy numbers in Guthrie card samples readily identified patients with SCID, XLA, ataxia-telangiectasia and Nijmegen-breakage-syndrome and thus facilitates effective newborn screening for severe immunodeficiency syndromes characterized by the absence of T or B cells."
CD011926,0,17534128,0,Genetic causes of bronchiectasis: primary ciliary dyskinesia.,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder reflecting abnormalities in the structure and function of motile cilia and flagella, causing impairment of mucociliary clearance, left-right body asymmetry, and sperm motility. Clinical manifestations include respiratory distress in term neonates, recurrent otosinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, situs inversus and/or heterotaxy, and male infertility. Genetic discoveries are emerging from family-based linkage studies and from testing candidate genes. Mutations in 2 genes, DNAI1 and DNAH5, frequently cause PCD as an autosomal recessive disorder. A clinical genetic test has been recently established for DNAI1 and DNAH5, which involves sequencing 9 exons that harbor the most common mutations. This approach will identify at least one mutation in these 2 genes in approximately 25% of PCD patients. If biallelic mutations are identified, the test is diagnostic. If only one mutation is identified, the full gene may be sequenced to search for a trans-allelic mutation. As more disease-causing gene mutations are identified, broader genetic screening panels will further identify patients with PCD. Ongoing investigations are beginning to identify genetic mutations in novel clinical phenotypes for PCD, such as congenital heart disease and male infertility, and new associations are being established between 'ciliary' genetic mutations and clinical phenotypes."

Low coverage of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) interventions, adherence, and retention-in-care rates in HIV-positive pregnant women are contributing factors to high mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) rates. In Nigeria, rural areas, served largely by primary health care facilities, have particularly poor indicators of PMTCT coverage. Mentor Mothers are HIV-positive women who serve as peer counselors for PMTCT clients, provide guidance, and support in keeping appointments and promoting antiretroviral adherence and retention-in-care.

CD011926,0,8066060,0,[Contribution of gene amplification in the biological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis].,"Biological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is generally based on indirect arguments (serology). In cases of immaturity or of immune depression, however, evidence of the parasite has to be obtained. This involves time-consuming or relatively insensitive culture techniques. Molecular biology, and more particularly the polymerase chain reaction gene amplification technique, makes it possible to identify an extremely small quantity of parasites in a complex biological fluid in a few hours. We summarized our experience with an original technique using toxoplasma ribosomal DNA as the target. Its use in the amniotic fluid provides a distinct improvement in antenatal diagnosis and is fast becoming the technique of reference. Difficult cases have been solved by its application in ophthalmology. Finally, in immunodepressed patients, especially in cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, assessment is currently ongoing. The results obtained so far, especially in the analysis of the cerebral spinal fluid, are encouraging."
CD011926,0,10681329,0,"Biochemical sequence analyses of GES-1, a novel class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the class 1 integron In52 from Klebsiella pneumoniae.","Klebsiella pneumoniae ORI-1 was isolated in 1998 in France from a rectal swab of a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in Cayenne Hospital, Cayenne, French Guiana. This strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, pTK1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. The gene for GES-1 (Guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B, where this pI-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kDa molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to ceftazidime). GES-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase GN79 from Proteus mirabilis; with YENT, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from Yersinia enterocolitica; and with L-2, a chromosome-borne class A cephalosporinase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36% amino acid identity each). However, a dendrogram analysis showed that GES-1 clustered within a class A ESBL subgroup together with ESBLs VEB-1 and PER-1. Sequencing of a 7,098-bp DNA fragment from plasmid pTK1 revealed that the GES-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named In52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an intI1 gene possessing two putative promoters, P(1) and P(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an attI1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(GES-1), aac(6')Ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrXVb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA4), and aadA2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacEDelta1 and sulI. The bla(GES-1) and aadA2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. This work identified the second class A ESBL gene of a non-TEM, non-SHV series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression."

Respiratory diseases linked to environment are frequent in children. Cough is the most common symptom in child asthma and usually occurs during sleep or exercise. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure may concern up to 30% of families. Questioning should systematically check for parental smoking in children with chronic cough since avoidance is the only effective treatment. The incidence of whooping cough appears to be increasing and the diagnosis may be difficult among already immunized children in whom symptoms are often nonspecific. Nowadays Bordetella pertussis can easily be detected on nasal smears (ELISA, PCR, cultures). Swallowing dysfunction may cause productive cough in toddlers, most often related to functional dyspraxia, yet possibly due to aerodigestive tract malformation. Unrecognized bronchial foreign body is a well-known pitfall particularly between 9 and 36 months of age. Bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis are responsible for chronic productive cough in toddlers and older children. In teenagers, psychogenic coughing is difficult to manage and usually requires psycho- and speech therapy."

During a 30-week period, 3 infants developed infections and an additional 60 infants were colonized with these bacteria. The molecular typing data suggested transmission of a single strain of ceftazidime-resistant K. oxytoca among 48 of the 63 infants. The ESBL of 46 of the 48 similar isolates, 14 of the remaining 15 isolates, and 6 other Enterobacteriaceae appeared to be associated with a conjugative plasmid of approximately 85 kb.

CD011926,0,23374612,0,Advances in basic and clinical immunology in 2012.,"Basic and clinical immunology articles published in the Journal in 2012 were mostly related to the expanding area of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Novel forms of PID were identified by using whole-exome sequencing or after careful examination of flow cytometric data, as in the reports of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase, CD27, and CD21 deficiencies. Absent IgG and IgA memory B cells were described in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome, which is consistent with defective antibody response and suggests a potential benefit of immunoglobulin replacement. Impaired production of antibodies to polysaccharide antigens by the human B-cell subset analog to murine B-1 cells was reported in a child with selective polysaccharide antibody deficiency. Increased production of inflammatory cytokines by monocyte-derived cells on Toll-like receptor activation was reported in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, underscoring the important role of Bruton tyrosine kinase in modulation of inflammation. The mechanisms explaining susceptibility to yeast infections and development of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis were extensively studied. Universal newborn screening for T-cell deficiencies is being implemented in several states, resulting in the diagnosis of a higher number of immunodeficient newborns than previously estimated. The use of laboratory testing to distinguish PIDs from HIV infection was clarified. In the management of PIDs, refinement of indication and strategies to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation resulted in improved outcomes. The use of anti-IL-6 mAbs showed promise as an alternative treatment in patients with Schnitzler syndrome."

A total of 3839 stool specimens from diarrheal patients from eight hospitals were analyzed. Winter seasonality was observed for rotavirus diarrhea in both adults and children, showing overall rotavirus-positive rates of 9.0 and 23.9%, respectively. Throughout the study period, G3 was the most frequent G serotype in both adults and children (detection rates 86.2 and 87.8%, respectively), and was mostly associated with VP4 genotype P[8], VP 6 genotype II (subgroup II), and NSP4 genotype B. G3 rotaviruses were differentiated into eight electropherotypes, among which seven types were found in specimens from both adults and children. VP7 gene sequences of G3 rotaviruses from adults and children (6 and 4 strains, respectively), detected in different years and different hospitals, showed extremely high sequence identities (99-100%) to each other and to a few G3 rotavirus strains reported in Asia. However, lower sequence identities (82-96%) were observed to most of the human and animal G3 rotaviruses reported so far, including some Chinese strains. These findings indicate that in Wuhan, China, epidemic and genetic features of rotaviruses are similar in adults and children, and it has been suggested that G3 rotaviruses that might have originated from the same rotavirus were circulating among children and adults as prevailing viruses. In this study, two rotavirus strains, G9P[8] strain L169, derived from an adult, and G4P[6] strain R479, derived from a child, were isolated and genetically analyzed. The VP7 gene of L169 belongs to a major lineage of G9 rotaviruses that are globally widespread, but is distinct from G9 rotaviruses reported previously in China. The strain R479 had a VP7 gene which was divergent from most G4 human rotaviruses and showed an unusual dual subgroup specificity, I + II. The R479 VP6 gene does not belong to the main clusters of subgroup I and II rotaviruses phylogenetically, but is related to those of the porcine rotaviruses and some unusual human rotaviruses represented by the RMC321 strain isolated in eastern India."

CD011926,0,17569089,0,Protein C promoter polymorphisms associate with sepsis in children with systemic meningococcemia.,"Meningococcal disease may present as sepsis, meningitis or a combination of both. Protein C (PC) is an important regulator of thrombin activity. Two polymorphisms in the promoter region of PC (C-1654T, A-1641G) have been shown to affect PC levels. In patients with meningococcal sepsis, low PC levels have been correlated with increased severity and poor outcome. We established a multicenter case-control study to determine whether PC promoter polymorphisms are associated with occurrence and outcome of meningococcal disease and sepsis. 288 previously healthy children with meningococcal infection from 97 pediatric hospitals in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Austria and 309 healthy controls were included in the study. A strong age-dependant effect was found. Patients younger than 1 year carried significantly more often the CG-CG genotype than healthy controls (28.6% vs. 17.8%, P = 0.04). Carriers of the CG allele showed a 3.43-fold increased odds ratio (OR) to develop sepsis (95% CI: 1.05-11.20; 85.7% vs. 63.6%, P = 0.036). The TA-TA genotype conferred a protective role for the development of sepsis (P = 0.017) with a Haldane OR of 0.09 (95% CI: 0.01-0.94). Systolic blood pressure values were significantly decreased in patients carrying the CG-CG genotype (70 vs. 86 mmHg, P = 0.005), and the need for adrenergic support significantly higher (70% vs. 26%, P = 0.018), resulting in an OR of 6.61 (95% CI: 1.28-34.14). These findings show that in young children PC promoter genotype is associated with susceptibility for meningococcal disease, the development of meningococcal sepsis, lower blood pressure, and need for adrenergic support."
CD011926,0,7665644,0,Detection and quantification of virus DNA in plasma of patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated diseases.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes various diseases, such as infectious mononucleosis (IM), fatal IM, EBV-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (EBVAHS), and chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV). In the present study, cell-free EBV DNA was detected in the plasma of patients with EBV-associated diseases by PCR assay. The patients included 20 patients with IM, 2 patients with fatal IM, 4 patients with EBVAHS, 4 patients with CAEBV, and 38 healthy children (20 EBV seropositive and 18 EBV seronegative). In patients with IM, plasma samples were positive for EBV DNA in all patients (100%) in the acute phase and in 44% of the patients in the convalescent phase, but plasma samples from the 38 healthy control children were negative (0%) for EBV DNA. Quantitative PCR assay revealed that plasma from patients with IM contained the highest amount of virus DNA within 7 days following the onset of disease (mean, 6 x 10(4) copies per ml). The EBV DNA concentration decreased thereafter as the patients recovered. Plasma from patients with fatal IM contained more than 100 times more copies of EBV DNA (3 x 10(7) copies per ml) than plasma from patients with IM. Plasma from patients with the acute phase of EBVAHS contained 10 times more copies of EBV DNA (5 x 10(5) copies per ml) than plasma from IM, and then patients with the number of copies decreased similarly in both groups of patients in the convalescent phase (2 x 10(4) copies per ml). The amount of virus DNA in patients with CAEBV (6 x 10(4) copies per ml) was similar to that noted in patients with IM; however, it became higher (1 x 10(6) copies per ml) when the patients' clinical status deteriorated. These data suggest that the presence of cell-free EBV DNA in plasma is a common phenomenon in patients with EBV-associated diseases. The concentration of EBV DNA in plasma seems to be higher in patients with the more severe clinical categories of EBV diseases."

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 109 newborn 1-month-old infants were assigned randomly to a probiotic group receiving a BB-12-containing tablet (n 55) or to a control group receiving a control tablet (n 54). Test tablets were administered to the infants twice a day (daily dose of BB-12 10 billion colony-forming units) from the age of 1-2 months to 8 months with a novel slow-release pacifier or a spoon. Breastfeeding habits, pacifier use, dietary habits, medications and all signs and symptoms of acute infections were registered. At the age of 8 months, faecal samples were collected for BB-12 determination (quantitative PCR method). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar, as was the duration of exclusive breastfeeding. BB-12 was recovered (detection limit log 5) in the faeces of 62% of the infants receiving the BB-12 tablet. The daily duration of pacifier sucking was not associated with the occurrence of acute otitis media. No significant differences between the groups were observed in reported gastrointestinal symptoms, otitis media or use of antibiotics. However, the infants receiving BB-12 were reported to have experienced fewer respiratory infections (65 v. 94%; risk ratio 0·69; 95% CI 0·53, 0·89; P = 0·014) than the control infants.

T. gondii DNA was found in 2/4 samples from the I group and in 1/14 from the II group. Villitis was identified in 3/15 other placentae from the II group. In the III group we did not recognize neither T. gondii DNA nor villitis. We consider PCR and pathologic evaluations of placentae as the two complementary methods. PCR can be especially helpful in pregnancies not screened against T. gondii as positive result in placenta can confirm mother's primary infection."

In total, 1,315 clinical samples were collected from Bangkok and Khon Kaen provinces and were screened by semi-nested PCR for RSV infection. We found 74 samples (27.7 %) and 71 samples (6.8 %) to be RSV positive for Bangkok and Khon Kaen, respectively, and we sequenced 122 of these samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 100 of the RSV-A-positive samples clustered into either genotype NA1 or the recently discovered genotype ON1 strain, which has a 72-nucleotide duplication in the second variable region of its G protein. Moreover, 22 of the RSV-B-positive samples clustered into four genotypes; BA4, BA9, BA10 and genotype THB, first described here. The NA1 genotype was found to be the predominant strain in 2010 and 2011. The ON1 strain detected in this study first emerged in 2011 and is genetically similar to ON1 strains characterized in other counties. We also describe the THB genotype, which was first identified in 2005 and is genetically similar to the GB2 genotype. In conclusion, this study indicates the importance of molecular epidemiology and characterization of RSV in Thailand in order to better understand this virus. Further studies should be conducted to bolster the development of antiviral agents and a vaccine."

CD011926,0,8034497,0,Early diagnosis and immunologic changes in HIV-1 infected pregnant women and their children.,"The diagnosis of HIV infection in pregnant women is usually based on the detection of HIV-specific antibodies. These tests become positive a few weeks to months after infection. In the United States, it is recommended that tests be offered to all women and encouraged where the rate of infection is > or = 1/1,000 or the woman is at increased risk for infection. The great majority of infected pregnant women are asymptomatic, and questioning patients about risk behavior will identify only about one-half of the infected women. In Washington, D.C. about 1.5% of the pregnant women who reside in the city are HIV positive. The diagnosis of HIV in the child in the first month of life is difficult and requires the use of polymerase chain reaction tests and/or culture. Other tests become positive later. Immunological tests in most HIV-infected mothers in the USA are normal; however, about 12% of patients are symptomatic and show decreased CD4 T cell counts and 6% have AIDS. These patients may have other evidence of decreased T cell responses and are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. At birth, almost all children of HIV-infected mothers have normal immunological findings. However, about 50 of these children become ill by 1 year of age and many develop decreased T cell counts and other immunological changes."
CD011926,0,19777784,0,Mother-to-child HIV and HHV-8 transmission in neonates at Saint Camille Medical Centre in Burkina Faso.,"In Sub-Saharan Africa, many HIV infected people are co-infected with Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV-8). Therefore, the present study aimed to: (1) identify the pregnant women co-infected by HIV and HHV-8 at Saint Camille Medical Centre; (2) use three molecules (Zidovudine, Nevirapine and Lamivudine) to interrupt the vertical transmission of HIV and (3) use the PCR technique to diagnose children, who were infected by these viruses, in order to offer them an early medical assistance. A total of 107 pregnant women, aged from 19 to 42 years were diagnosed to be HIV positive at Saint Camille Centre; among them 13 were co-infected with HHV-8. All included women received the HAART. Two to six months after childbirth their babies underwent PCR diagnosis for HIV and HHV-8. The results revealed that, among these mothers, 68.2% were housewives, 34.6% were illiterates and 60.7% did not have university degree. The prevalence of HHV-8 among these pregnant women was 12.15% and the rate of vertical transmission of both HIV and HHV-8, was 0.0%. The issue of this study revealed that the antiretroviral therapy increased the mother CD4 T-cells, prevented the transcription of the mRNA of HHV-8 and blocked HIV vertical transmission."

Powdered milk-based infant formulas have been associated with the E. sakazakii-related outbreaks in premature or other immunocompromised infants. In this study, an assay was developed for the specific detection of E. sakazakii in infant formula using an application of the fluorogenic 5' nuclease assay (TaqMan). A set of primers and probe was designed using the E. sakazakii partial macromolecular synthesis operon: the rpsU gene 3' end and the primase (dnaG) gene 5' end. The specificity of the assay was evaluated using 68 Enterobacter and 55 non-Enterobacter strains. The newly developed assay enables us to detect 100 CFU/ ml in pure culture and in reconstituted infant formula in 50 cycles of PCR without enrichment. The assay was specific enough to discriminate E. sakazakii from all other Enterobacter and non-Enterobacter strains tested. The developed real-time PCR assay could save up to 5 days and eliminate the need for plating samples on selective or diagnostic agars and for biochemical confirmation steps. The real-time PCR assay could be used to rapidly screen infant formula samples for E. sakazakii and would be a boon to food industries and regulatory agencies."

CD011926,0,12734212,0,"Virulence markers of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli isolated from children and adults with diarrhea in Brasília, Brazil.","Escherichia coli strains isolated from sporadic cases of acute diarrhea in children and adults and from children without diarrhea were investigated for the presence of the pAA plasmid. Strains harboring the pAA plasmid were isolated at similar frequencies from children with (19.6%) and without (10.8%) diarrhea and from adults with diarrhea (11.8%). The genotypic and phenotypic virulence markers of these strains were further analyzed. Most of the strains were positive for EAST1 (73%), and this toxin was detected significantly more frequently in strains from children with diarrhea than in strains from adults with diarrhea (P < 0.05). Likewise, pic sequences were detected significantly more frequently in strains from children with diarrhea than in strains from adults with diarrhea (P < 0.005) and controls (P < 0.025). Furthermore, the association of pAA positivity (pAA(+)) and pic positivity (pic(+)) was more frequently found for strains from children with diarrhea than for strains from controls, indicating that pAA(+) pic(+) strains may represent a subset of pAA(+) strains associated with disease in children. Most of the strains (82.5%) adhered to cells presenting the typical aggregative pattern. The frequency of occurrence of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) serogroups in the strains from children with diarrhea was very high (56%), while none of the strains from adults with diarrhea belonged to EPEC serogroups. Extraintestinal virulence markers were very commonly found in strains from adults with diarrhea. The frequencies of occurrence of the adhesins AFA and SFA were significantly higher in strains from adults with diarrhea than in strains from children with diarrhea. More than one extraintestinal virulence marker was found in 58% of the strains from adults with diarrhea but in only 7.7% of the strains from children with diarrhea. Our results show that pAA(+) strains isolated from children and adults with diarrhea present very different profiles when enteroaggregative E. coli virulence markers, serotypes, and extraintestinal virulence markers are considered."
CD011926,0,10970395,0,Genotyping of the capsule gene cluster (cps) in nontypeable group B streptococci reveals two major cps allelic variants of serotypes III and VII.,"Forty group B Streptococcus (GBS) isolates obtained from Europe and the United States previously reported to be nontypeable (NT) by capsule serotype determination were subjected to buoyant density gradient centrifugation. From nearly half of the isolates capsule-expressing variants could be selected. For characterization of the remaining NT-GBS isolates, the capsule operon (cps) was amplified by the long-fragment PCR technique and compared by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The patterns from serotype reference isolates (n = 32) were first determined and used as a comparison matrix for the NT-GBS isolates. Using two restriction enzymes, SduI and AvaII, cluster analysis revealed a high degree of similarity within serotypes but less than 88% similarity between serotypes. However, serotypes III and VII were each split in two distant RFLP clusters, which were designated III(1) and III(2) and VII(1) and VII(2), respectively. Among the isolates that remained NT after repeated Percoll gradient selections, two insertional mutants were revealed. Both were found in blood isolates and harbored insertion sequence (IS) elements within cpsD: one harbored IS1548, and the other harbored IS861. All other NT-GBS isolates could, by cluster analysis, be referred to different serotypes by comparison to the RFLP reference matrix. In pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-restricted chromosomal DNA, patterns from allelic type 1 and 2 isolates were essentially distributed in separate clusters in serotypes III and VII. A covariation with insertion sequence IS1548 in the hylB gene was suggested for serotype III, since allelic type III(1) harboring IS1548 in hylB, clustered separately. The variation in serotype VII was not dependent on the presence of IS1548, which was not detected at any position in the type VII chromosome."

CD011926,0,9040855,0,Dried blood spots collected on filter paper: an international resource for the diagnosis and genetic characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type-1.,"The collection of dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper provides a powerful approach for the development of large-scale, population-based screening programs. DBS methods are particularly valuable in developing countries and isolated rural regions where resources are limited. Large numbers of field specimens can be economically collected and shipped to centralized reference laboratories for genetic and (or) serological analysis. Alternatively, the dried blood can be stored and used as an archival resource to rapidly establish the frequency and distribution of newly recognized mutations, confirm patient identity or track the origins and emergence of newly identified pathogens. In this report, we describe how PCR-based technologies are beginning to interface with international screening programmes for the diagnosis and genetic characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In particular, we review recent progress using DBS specimens to resolve the HIV-1 infection status of neonates, monitor the genetic evolution of HIV-1 during early infancy and establish a sentinel surveillance system for the systematic monitoring of HIV-1 genetic variation in Asia."

CD011926,0,8789012,0,Comparison of a modified DNA hybridization assay with standard culture enrichment for detecting group B streptococci in obstetric patients.,"Infection with group B streptococcus (GBS) results in 12,000 to 15,000 cases of neonatal sepsis annually in the United States. GBS is transmitted vertically in up to 70% of infants born to colonized women. Early-onset GBS disease (septicemia, pneumonia, or meningitis occurring within 7 days of life) has a mortality rate of up to 50%, with permanent neurologic sequelae occurring in 15 to 50% of infants surviving meningeal infection. Because of the fulminant nature of neonatal infection, it would be useful to have a rapid assay for determining the GBS status of laboring women. This study illustrated how a commercially available DNA probe-based test was modified to achieve this goal. Modifications included the use of mixed cultures rather than pure isolates for detecting GBS, along with a shorter culture enrichment time and a sample concentration step. To this end, vaginal and rectal swabs from 402 pregnant women during their third trimester were cocultured and tested for GBS rRNA. The 8-h enrichment protocol resulted in an assay with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98%, while the 3-h enrichment protocol revealed a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 99%. In summary, GBS was detected in the majority of colonized women in less than 4 h. This study illustrated the usefulness of the approach in identifying the most heavily colonized women, who are at the highest risk of transmitting GBS to their neonates. The modified test would have a significant impact on both the medical management and antibiotic therapy for these women and their newborns."

CD011926,0,3009084,0,Immunoassays for the diagnosis of viral enteric pathogens.,"The accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases is important for the optimal management of infected patients as well as for the prevention of disease transmission to susceptible individuals. Because viral gastroenteritis constitutes an important cause of morbidity in children living in developed countries and of mortality in children living in developing countries, there has been a great deal of interest in the development of effective methods for the diagnosis and study of this disease. While there are a number of assay systems that are capable of accurate detection of the agents of viral gastroenteritis in the intestinal contents of infected individuals, solid phase enzyme immunoassays have been used widely for this purpose. The widespread utilization of enzyme immunoassays is based on the advantages inherent in the use of enzymatic markers. These advantages include the stability of enzyme-immunoglobulin conjugates, the high degree of sensitivity inherent in the magnifying nature of enzyme-substrate interactions, and the low cost of assays performed in simple reaction formats. Enzyme immunoassays have thus been developed and widely used for the detection and epidemiologic study of rotaviruses, adenoviruses, coxsackie viruses, hepatitis A virus, and other agents that replicate in the human gastrointestinal tract. In addition, latex agglutination assays and nucleic acid hybridization techniques have been applied to the rapid detection of enteric viruses. It is likely that the application of a number of assay systems will promote accurate identification of a wide range of viral pathogens under different clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory situations."

CD011926,0,22257453,0,[Rhinoviruses. Frequency in nonhospitalized children with acute respiratory infection].,"Molecular methods for human rhinoviruses (HRV) have increased the sensitivity in their diagnosis. HRV may cause acute respiratory infections (ARI) of the upper and lower respiratory tract. HRV infection during childhood is a predictor of asthma development. In this study, the HRV frequency in outpatient children with ARI was determined, and their clinical features and previous conditions were evaluated. A total of 186 respiratory samples of children under 6 year old attending the CEMIC pediatric emergency room from June 1, 2008 to May 31, 2010, were studied. Classical respiratory viruses were detected by immunofluorescence. A real time RT-PCR that amplifies part of the 5' non coding genomic region was used for HRV detection. Viral detection was obtained in 61% of children. The frequency was: 27% for HRV, 16% for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 9% for influenza, 8% for parainfluenza, 7% for metapneumovirus and 0.5% for adenovirus. Dual coinfection was detected in 8 children and HRV were the most frequent, detected in 4 of them. HRV circulated during the two year period of the study, with peaks during winter and spring. No clinical difference was observed between patients with or without HRV, except an increase percent of children with HRV without fever. HRV were the most frequent viruses detected in this population, mainly in children under 2 year old, the second cause of bronchiolitis after RSV and more frequently detected in children exposed to passive smoking (OR = 2.91; p = 0.012), and were detected as the sole etiologic agent in 28% of bronchiolitis."

CD011926,0,19626607,0,Detection of four human coronaviruses in respiratory infections in children: a one-year study in Colorado.,"Lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death in children worldwide. Studies on the epidemiology and clinical associations of the four human non-SARS human coronaviruses (HCoVs) using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of HCoV infections worldwide. Pediatric respiratory specimens (1,683) submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory over a 1-year period (December 2004-November 2005) that were negative for seven respiratory viruses by conventional methods were tested for RNA of four HCoVs using sensitive RT-PCR assays. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 84 (5.0%) specimens: HCoV-NL63 in 37 specimens, HCoV-OC43 in 34, HCoV-229E in 11, and HCoV-HKU1 in 2. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during winter months, and over 62% were in previously healthy children. Twenty-six (41%) coronavirus positive patients had evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 17 (26%) presented with vomiting and/or diarrhea, and 5 (8%) presented with meningoencephalitis or seizures. Respiratory specimens from one immunocompromised patient were persistently positive for HCoV-229E RNA for 3 months. HCoV-NL63-positive patients were nearly twice as likely to be hospitalized (P = 0.02) and to have a LRTI (P = 0.04) than HCoV-OC43-positive patients. HCoVs are associated with a small, but significant number (at least 2.4% of total samples submitted), of both upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses in children in Colorado. Our data raise the possibility that HCoV may play a role in gastrointestinal and CNS disease. Additional studies are needed to investigate the potential roles of HCoVs in these diseases."

CD011926,0,11774017,0,Neonatal varicella.,"Neonatal varicella is mostly caused by maternal chickenpox acquired during the last 3 weeks of pregnancy. Transplacentally transmitted infections occur in the first 10 to 12 days of life, whereas chickenpox after that time is most likely acquired by postnatal infection. If the mother develops rash between days 4 and 5 antepartum to day 2 postpartum, generalized neonatal varicella leading to death occurs in up to 20% of affected cases. Neonatal chickenpox within the first 4 days after birth has usually been found to be mild. A fatal outcome has been reported in 23% of cases if neonatal chickenpox occurs between 5 and 10 to 12 days of age. Serological methods have been widely used to confirm clinical diagnosis. For rapid virological diagnostics, amplification of viral DNA in skin swabs by polymerase chain reaction is the method of choice. To prevent severe neonatal chickenpox, passive immunization is indicated. If varicella occurs, acyclovir treatment has to be administered promptly."
CD011926,0,19109464,0,Molecular epidemiology of norovirus gastroenteritis investigated using samples collected from children in Tunisia during a four-year period: detection of the norovirus variant GGII.4 Hunter as early as January 2003.,"Human noroviruses (NoVs) cause epidemic and endemic acute gastroenteritis in children and adults. To study the prevalence and genetic diversity of NoV in children in Tunisia, a total of 788 fecal samples were collected during a 4-year period in the region of Monastir, from children 12 years of age or younger, hospitalized or presenting in dispensaries with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. NoV was detected by reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed by sequence analysis. This is the first report that describes the molecular epidemiology of NoV in Tunisian children: NoVs were characterized as the causative agent in 128 (16.2%) of the samples. Fourteen samples contained a mixture of two NoVs, and 33 samples were coinfected with additional enteric viruses. Eight distinct NoV genotypes were detected (GGI.2, GGI.4, GGII.1, GGII.4, GGII.8, GGII.14, GGIIb/GGII.2, and GGIIb/GGII.3). GGII.4 was the most prevalent genotype, accounting for 83 (64.8%) cases. Interestingly the GGII.4 variant Hunter, described as spreading all over the world in 2004, was found in Tunisia as early as January 2003. The delay of 1 year between the isolation in Tunisia and the worldwide emergence is somewhat surprising, considering the importance of the contacts between North Africa and Europe particularly. Nevertheless, this illustrates the idea that sporadic gastroenteritis cases may be a reservoir for emerging epidemic NoV strains."
CD011926,0,15722029,0,Detection of enterovirus RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using NucliSens EasyQ Enterovirus assay.,"Rapid detection of enterovirus (EV) infections is essential in the management of aseptic meningitis. Molecular approaches have opened the way to such rapid, but also specific and sensitive, diagnostic tests. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the CE marked NucliSens EasyQ Enterovirus assay with an in-house two-step RT-PCR assay using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and throat swab samples. In addition, specificity was tested with clinical isolates positive for viruses with clinical importance in CSF samples. For nucleic acid extraction, the NucliSens miniMAG and NucliSens magnetic extraction reagents were used. Subsequently real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) RNA amplification was performed using NucliSens EasyQ basic kit reagents and NucliSens EasyQ Enterovirus reagents. An EV-specific internal homologous control (IC) RNA was used to monitor the entire NucliSens EasyQ procedure at the individual sample level. No IC but an external inhibition control was available for the RT-PCR method. For the NucliSens EasyQ procedure, amplification and real-time detection reactions were carried out in the NucliSens EasyQ analyzer. The real-time NASBA enterovirus detection was based on NASBA amplification and real-time molecular beacon technology. Data were analyzed using the manufacturer's software on the NucliSens EasyQ analyzer. For the in-house assay, RT-PCR amplicons were detected using agarose gel analysis. The analysis of clinical samples positive for HSV-1, HSV-2, adenovirus, CMV, VZV, mumps and rhinovirus were all negative by NucliSens EasyQ Enterovirus assay. Three rhinovirus samples were, however, strongly positive in RT-PCR. A total of 141 clinical samples were retrospectively tested, including 126 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and 15 throat swabs. The 91 CSF samples were negative by both methods, 31 CSF samples and 14 throat swab samples were positive by both methods. The four CSF samples were positive by RT-PCR only. One throat swab sample was negative in NucliSens EasyQ but positive in RT-PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of both methods seem to be more or less comparable. However, the in-house RT-PCR assay appears to amplify some rhinovirus strains and should therefore not be used for throat swab samples. NucliSens EasyQ Enterovirus assay gave more invalid results than the in-house RT-PCR, which is obvious taken into account the difference in quality control between the CE marked NucliSens EasyQ Enterovirus assay and the in-house enterovirus assay. The NucliSens EasyQ procedure can be completed within 5h versus 9.5h for the RT-PCR. NucliSens EasyQ Enterovirus assay showed to be a standardized, rapid, specific, sensitive and reliable procedure for the detection of enterovirus RNA."
CD011926,0,11805444,0,Three cases with TT virus infection and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis.,"We present three cases of infants with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis showing diffuse intrahepatic fatty degeneration. Prolonged cholestasis has improved immediately upon intravenous administration of a high-dose gammaglobulin treatment in all three patients. The TT virus (TTV) genome was detectable in the serum of two patients, in the duodenal fluid of one and in the liver of all three. By analyzing sequence homology, we observed that the respective TTV isolated from serum, duodenal fluid and liver tissue were completely identical in cases 2 and 3. These findings suggest that TTV infection was one of the contributing factors for neonatal cholestasis in these patients. TTV was isolated from the serum of two out of the three mothers. The viruses were either completely or almost identical in sequence to those isolated from their respective infants, suggesting that they had been transmitted from mother to infant in these 2 cases. The patients presented here, whose livers were infected with the TTV and showed a favorable response to gammaglobulin therapy, may represent a subset of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis patients."

Stool samples were tested by EIA and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. EIA was less sensitive (74%) and equally specific, compared with RT-PCR analysis using type-common primers for HAstV detection. Of 31 HAstV isolates, EIA typed 18 (69%) of 26 EIA-positive samples, and RT-PCR analysis typed 26 (84%) of 31 RT-PCR-positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the 3' end of the capsid region (363 nucleotides) confirmed the type assignment by EIA and RT-PCR analysis and determined the type for 5 previously untyped samples. Six HAstV antigenic types cocirculated in the community: HAstV-2 (42%), HAstV-4 (23%), HAstV-3 (13%), HAstV-1 (10%), HAstV-5 (6%), and HAstV-7 (6%).

CD011926,0,18318280,0,Quantitative assessment of human whole blood RNA as a potential biomarker for infectious disease.,"Infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality especially in newborn infants. Analytical methods for diagnosing infection are severely limited in terms of sensitivity and specificity and require relatively large samples. It is proposed that stringent regulation of the human transcriptome affords a new molecular diagnostic approach based on measuring a highly specific systemic inflammatory response to infection, detectable at the RNA level. This proposition raises a number of as yet poorly characterised technical and biological variation issues that urgently need to be addressed. Here we report a quantitative assessment of methodological approaches for processing and extraction of RNA from small samples of infant whole blood and applying analysis of variation from biochip measurements. On the basis of testing and selection from a battery of assays we show that sufficient high quality RNA for analysis using multiplex array technology can be obtained from small neonatal samples. These findings formed the basis of implementing a set of robust clinical and experimental standard operating procedures for whole blood RNA samples from 58 infants. Modelling and analysis of variation between samples revealed significant sources of variation from the point of sample collection to processing and signal generation. These experiments further permitted power calculations to be run indicating the tractability and requirements of using changes in RNA expression profiles to detect different states between patient groups. Overall the results of our investigation provide an essential first step toward facilitating an alternative way for diagnosing infection from very small neonatal blood samples, providing methods and requirements for future chip-based studies."
CD011926,0,22803629,0,Reliability of a rapid test for the clinical diagnosis of influenza A/H1N1 2009.,"The rapid diagnosis of a pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus infection is required in ambulatory care settings, since early identification can prevent further transmission. However, the sensitivity of rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) is still questionable, and specific indicators for H1N1pdm and/or false-negative results by RIDTs have not been clearly determined."
CD011926,0,18068812,0,One-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus in children.,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the main cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children. Rapid diagnosis is required to permit appropriate care and treatment and to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. Reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) methods have been considered important tools for virus detection due to their high sensitivity and specificity. In order to maximize use-simplicity and minimize the risk of sample cross-contamination inherent in two-step techniques, a RT-PCR method using only a single tube to detect HRSV in clinical samples was developed. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 226 patients with acute respiratory illness, ranging from infants to 5 years old, were collected at the University Hospital of the University of Sao Paulo (HU-USP), and tested using IFA, one-step RT-PCR, and semi-nested RT-PCR. One hundred and two (45.1%) samples were positive by at least one of the three methods, and 75 (33.2%) were positive by all methods: 92 (40.7%) were positive by one-step RT-PCR, 84 (37.2%) by IFA, and 96 (42.5%) by the semi-nested RT-PCR technique. One-step RT-PCR was shown to be fast, sensitive, and specific for RSV diagnosis, without the added inconvenience and risk of false positive results associated with semi-nested PCR. The combined use of these two methods enhances HRSV detection."

CD011926,0,8284639,0,Detection of enteroviral RNA by polymerase chain reaction in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with aseptic meningitis.,"An assay based on a 2-step (semi-nested) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed and evaluated for detection of enterovirus-specific RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with aseptic meningitis of different etiology. The limit of detectability of enteroviral RNA was equivalent to about 0.25 tissue culture infective doses 50%. In samples, stored at -70 degrees C, analyzed without repeated thawing, enteroviral RNA was demonstrable in 21/22 CSF specimens from which an enterovirus had been isolated. Enteroviral RNA was shown to be degraded during freeze-thawing of the samples. In repeatedly freeze-thawed samples from 134 consecutive patients with aseptic meningitis, a lower sensitivity (34/48 = 0.71) was observed. In the latest phase of the study, comprising 35 consecutive patients, the PCR was performed in CSF stored at -20 degrees C without thawing. In this material, the PCR yielded positive results in 19 patients, whereas enteroviruses were isolated from 6 cases only. In the total clinical material of 169 patients, 67 (40%) were found positive by PCR, whereas an enterovirus was isolated from CSF in 54 (32%) cases. All the 13 isolated enterovirus serotypes found in the study were demonstrable by PCR, indicating that the assay is broad-reacting within the enterovirus group. The specificity appeared to be high, since all of 21 patients with non-enteroviral diagnoses were negative by the PCR test, except 1 with an Epstein-Barr virus infection. As serological evidence of enteroviral etiology was found in this patient, a dual infection seemed probable. This study indicates that enteroviral RNA can be detected in CSF by a 2-step PCR in meningitis caused by enterovirus and that the technique has the potential to become a screening method for routine diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis."
CD011926,0,25361198,0,High prevalence of genotype 6E (putative serotype 6E) among noninvasive/colonization isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae in northern Japan.,"Serogroup 6 of Streptococcus pneumoniae contains four established serotypes (6A-6D). Recently, putative serotype 6E (genotype 6E) was proposed as a novel type, which is cross-reactive with 6B-specific antiserum, but its capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) locus is genetically distinct from those of serotypes 6A and 6B. In the present study, prevalence of genotype 6E was analyzed by a newly designed multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for noninvasive or colonizing S. pneumoniae isolates in northern Japan assigned to serogroup 6 in our previous study by the sequential multiplex PCR developed by Pai et al. Among the isolates previously assigned to 6A and 6B, 2.2% (1/45) and 77.3% (140/181) of isolates, respectively, were revealed to have cps genes of genotype 6E. Eight 6E isolates selected for further analysis were found to have identical or highly similar sequences of cps genes (wzg, wzh, wze, wciN, wciP, and wzy) to those of strains previously reported as putative serotype 6E, and all the isolates were classified into sequence type 90 (ST90). Reanalysis of genetic traits on penicillin and macrolide resistance clarified significantly higher rates of three pbp mutations (gPRSP) and ermB in genotype 6E than in serotypes 6A and 6B. These findings suggested a need for detection of genotype 6E in the surveillance of S. pneumoniae serotypes."
CD011926,0,15913797,0,Usage of dried blood spots for molecular diagnosis and monitoring HIV-1 infection.,"The usage of dried blood spots as specimens for diagnosis and monitoring of HIV-1 infection in Thailand was evaluated. EDTA blood samples, which were collected from 100 HIV seronegative and 109 HIV seropositive individuals, were tested on dried blood spots; Whatman, Schleicher and Schuell (S&S) No. 903 and S&S IsoCode filter paper. Nucleic acid was extracted and used as a template for HIV-1 proviral DNA detection by an ""in-house"" multiplex PCR and a commercial Amplicor HIV-1 PCR test (Roche, version 1.0). HIV-1 RNA qualitative (QL) and quantitative (QT) detection was determined by Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA). The average DNA per blood spot recovered from Whatman and S&S IsoCode was not statistically different (p = 0.512) with a range of 218.9+/-46.84 and 225.63+/-88.33 microg, respectively. The concordance of HIV-1 proviral DNA detection by PCR from dried blood spots Whatman and S&S IsoCode was 94% versus 89.4% for sensitivity and 100% versus 100% for specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of HIV-1 RNA QL detection in dried blood spots was 89.7 and 97.5%, respectively. The HIV-1 RNA QT from dried blood spots showed a good correlation in paired dried blood spots and plasma with Pearson correlation, r = 0.817 (R2 = 0.667, P < 0.05). The data showed that dried blood spots could be used for the diagnosis and monitoring of HIV-1 infection."
CD011926,0,11170998,0,Results of molecular detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae among patients with acute respiratory infection and in their household contacts reveals children as human reservoirs.,"During a 30-month prospective study in The Netherlands, the distribution of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and respiratory viruses among 1172 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) who were treated in the outpatient general practitioner setting was studied. M. pneumoniae, as detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis, was present in 39 (3.3%) patients. The infection rate was similar in all age groups. Nose and throat samples collected from 79 household contacts of M. pneumoniae-positive index patients revealed M. pneumoniae in 12 (15%) cases. The frequency of M. pneumoniae among household contacts of index patients treated with appropriate antibiotics and untreated index patients was similar. Nine of the 12 M. pneumoniae-positive household contacts were <16 years old (P=.02), and 4 (44%) of them did not develop ARI. Apparently, children are a relevant reservoir for M. pneumoniae."

CD011926,0,21998418,0,Comparison of the FilmArray Respiratory Panel and Prodesse real-time PCR assays for detection of respiratory pathogens.,"We compared the diagnostic performance and overall respiratory pathogen detection rate of the premarket version of the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) multiplex PCR assay (Idaho Technology, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) with those of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared Prodesse ProFlu+, ProFAST+, ProParaflu+, Pro hMPV+, and ProAdeno+ real-time PCR assays (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA). The assays were performed on a panel of 192 nasopharyngeal-secretion specimens collected from 81 children under 1 year of age with upper respiratory tract symptoms. To resolve discordant results and confirm pathogens detected only by the larger FilmArray panel, we performed laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays. Among viruses detectable by both commercial assays (adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, and respiratory syncytial virus), the FilmArray and Prodesse assays showed good overall agreement (181/192 [94.3%]; kappa = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.94). FilmArray RP detected more parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 than ProParaflu+ (18 versus 13) while ProAdeno+ detected more adenoviruses (11 versus 6), but these differences were not statistically significant. Additionally, FilmArray RP detected 138 pathogens (confirmed as true positives) not included in the Prodesse assays (rhinovirus [RV]/enterovirus [EV], 118; bocavirus, 8; coronavirus, 7; parainfluenza virus 4, 4; Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 1). FilmArray RP was cleared by the FDA following the completion of this study. The FDA-cleared version includes the following targets: adenovirus, coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza A virus (to type level only), influenza A H1 seasonal virus, influenza A H3 seasonal virus, influenza A virus H1-2009, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and RV/EV (no differentiation). The larger panel in the FilmArray RP assay allowed the detection of additional respiratory pathogens compared to the Prodesse assays. In this population of young children with upper respiratory tract infection, RV/EV accounted for the majority of the additional pathogens detected by FilmArray RP."

CD011926,0,9607071,0,"[Human papillomavirus, neonatal giant cell hepatitis and biliary duct atresia].","We previously recognized the presence of HPV-DNA in cases of idiopathic neonatal giant cell hepatitis (INGCH) and extrahepatic biliary duct atresia (EBDA) in archivated tissue using the PCR technique. In order to investigate a possible vertical transmission we looked for the presence of HPV-DNA in cervical swabs in the mothers along with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded hepatic tissue from 3 infants with INGCH and 4 patients with EBDA by nested-PCR. Cervical smears showed koilocytosis consistent with HPV infection in 2 cases. Delivery was vaginal except for one that was by cesarean section. All infants were males. Amplification of HPV-DNA was demonstrated in all cases, the types being concordant in infants and mothers. Although this is a small group, the findings appear in line with previous data. The presence of the same type of HPV-DNA in the infants' livers and their mothers' cervical swabs is another argument supporting the possibility of vertical transmission of the virus."
CD011926,0,11181210,0,[Emergent riboviruses implicated in gastroenteritis].,"Viral agents are one of the main causes of acute diarrhea, particularly in infants and young children. Astrovirus, coronavirus, torovirus, and picobirnavirus are increasingly being identified as causative agents of gastroenteritis. Astroviruses have been detected in the stools of between 1.2% and 20% of children with diarrhea requiring medical care in a variety of geographical areas. Outbreaks have been described in schools, day care settings and pediatric wards. Children younger than 3 years old are the most frequently affected. In temperate climates incidence is greater in winter whereas in tropical areas infection occurs throughout the year. Transmission is mainly through the fecaloral route. At least seven serotypes of human astroviruses have been recognized and serotype 1 is more common than the other serotypes. Astroviruses are often shed in stools during long periods and can be detected by electron microscopy. An enzymeimmunoassay technique that detects the astrovirus group antigen has been widely used in epidemiological studies. Nucleic acid hybridization and polymerase chain reactionbased techniques have also been used. Enteric coronaviruses have most frequently been associated with gastrointestinal disease in neonates and children younger than 12 years old. The role of toroviruses and picobirnaviruses as causative agents of gastroenteritis is still emerging. Further epidemiological studies to determine the frequency of these viruses in the community and to identify their mechanisms of transmission are needed, as are further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of diseases due to these agents."

We aimed to determine the prevalence of placental and congenital malaria and impact of HIV co-infection on trans-placental malaria transmission in 157 parturient women and their infants by microscopy and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in western Kenya. The prevalence of placental and cord blood infections were 17.2% and 0% by microscopy, and 33.1% and 10.8% by PCR. HIV co-infection was associated with a significant increase in placental parasite density (P < 0.05). Cord blood malaria prevalence was increased in co-infected women (odds ratio [OR] = 5.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.90-15.47) and correlated with placental parasite density (OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.80-3.67). A 1-log increase in placental monocyte count was associated with increased risk of congenital infection (P = 0.001) (OR = 48.15; 95% CI = 4.59-505.50). The HIV co-infected women have a significantly increased burden of placental malaria that increases the risk of congenital infection."
CD011926,0,9258938,0,Use of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for detection of rubella virus RNA in cell cultures inoculated with clinical samples.,"A recently developed reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) method for rubella virus (RV) RNA detection was assessed in a series of African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cell cultures inoculated with clinical samples from patients with suspected RV infection. Results were compared with those of conventional virus isolation/identification. The assay included an internal control of amplification consisting of a synthetic RNA molecule mimicking the RV E1 target sequence. A semiquantitation of RV RNA was achieved by comparing the relative band intensity of internal control and RV E1 fragment. RT-nPCR was positive in 15/16 (94%) RV isolation-positive cultures and in 12/60 (20%) RV isolation-negative cultures. All 27 cell cultures positive by RT-nPCR had been inoculated with clinical samples taken from patients with ascertained RV infection or given RV vaccination and consisted of cells harvested 1-10 days after primary inoculation of clinical samples. No RV RNA was found in any of the cell cultures inoculated with 14 clinical samples from 6 patients in whom RV infection was excluded. When considering the time-course of RV infection, it was found that RV RNA could be detected as early as 4 days p.i. in 10/21 (48%), and by 7-10 days p.i. in 27/28 (96%) cell cultures, whereas by the same time RV was isolated in only 7/16 (44%) cell cultures. Semiquantitation showed that: i) viral RNA amount progressively increased with time; ii) cell cultures containing very low levels of viral RNA one week p.i. either required a few blind passages for virus recovery or remained negative for RV isolation. Finally, PCR inhibitors were found in 10/164 (6%) cell cultures examined. In conclusion, RT-nPCR proved to be very sensitive and very specific and greatly reduced RV detection time in inoculated cell cultures."
CD011926,0,22692746,0,Detection and genetic diversity of human metapneumovirus in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections in Southwest China.,"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is the main pathogen causing respiratory tract infection in susceptible populations, particularly in children and the elderly. Specimens were collected from hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI), and the hMPV was detected by using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The full-length G gene of hMPV was amplified by RT-PCR. A total of 1,410 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from April 2008 to March 2011, and 114 (10.2%) were positive for hMPV. Most hMPV-positive children were <5 years of age. The hMPV infection rate peaked in the spring-summer season of 2008 to 2009 and 2009 to 2010, while hMPV circulated predominantly during the winter-spring season of 2010 to 2011. The full-length G gene of 23 hMPV strains was amplified, and group A and B viruses accounted for 95.7% (22/23) and 4.3% (1/23), respectively. Genotype A2b of hMPV appeared to be predominant during the study period. Three genotypes (A2b, A1, and B1) were prevalent in the epidemic season of 2008 to 2009, and only genotype A2b was identified in the other two seasons (2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011). The G gene of hMPV was predicted to encode proteins with four different lengths, in which one with 210 amino acids was first identified in China. These findings suggest that hMPV was an important pathogen of ALRTI in pediatric patients, especially those <5 years of age. Genotype A2b of hMPV likely predominates in Southwest China, where other genotypes also circulate."
CD011926,0,16602984,0,Characterization and epidemiologic subtyping of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains isolated from hemolytic uremic syndrome and diarrhea cases in Argentina.,"Argentina has a high incidence of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); 12.2 cases per 100,000 children younger than 5 years old were reported in 2002. Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is the primary etiologic agent of HUS, and STEC O157 is the predominant serogroup isolated. The main objective of the present work was to establish the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the STEC strains in general isolated from Argentine children during a prospective study and the clonal relatedness of STEC O157:H7 strains using subtyping techniques. One hundred and three STEC strains isolated from 99 children were included. The phenotypic and genotypic features were established, and a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) was performed to determine stx2 variants. The clonal relatedness of E. coli O157 isolates was established by phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The 103 STEC strains belonged to 18 different serotypes, and 59% were of serotype O157:H7. Stx2 was identified in 90.3%, and stx1 in 9.7%. Among the 61 STEC O157 strains, 93.4% harbored the stx2/stx2vh-a genes; PT4 (39.3%) and PT2 (29.5%) were the predominant phage types. Using PFGE with the enzyme XbaI, a total of 41 patterns with at least 80% similarity were identified, and seven clusters with identical profiles were established. Some of the clusters were further split by PFGE using BlnI as the second enzyme. Isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns were with one exception also indistinguishable by phage typing and stx genotyping. These findings confirmed that some isolates were genetically related. However, no epidemiological linkages were identified. STEC strains with different genotypes and belonging to diverse serotypes were isolated in Argentina. Some STEC O157 strains could not be distinguished by applying subtyping techniques such as PFGE and phage typing."

CD011926,0,8259683,0,Infection of human polyomaviruses JC and BK in peripheral blood leukocytes from immunocompetent individuals.,"Widely disseminated infection with the human polyomaviruses JC and BK is followed by lifelong asymptomatic viral persistence that can be reactivated under prolonged immunosuppression to fatal CNS and urogenital disease. In an attempt to understand the pathogenesis of polyomavirus diseases, we asked whether leukocytes are involved in polyomavirus infection in the immunocompetent host. Peripheral blood leukocytes from 29 immunocompetent individuals and umbilical cord blood from 10 newborn children were analyzed for the presence of polyomavirus DNA. Southern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of JCV-specific full-length virus genomes and indicated involvement of the second human polyomavirus BK. In contrast to specimens from newborn children, PCR amplification of target DNA in the adult age group followed by species-specific hybridization provided evidence of concomitant JCV and BKV infection in almost all specimens. Nucleotide sequencing of virus-specific products representing DNA segments essential for virus multiplication confirmed presence of both virus species in leukocytes. The detection of a new virus subtype and single base changes or deletions in the noncoding DNA region from individual cases suggested widespread heterogeneity in the circulating virus population, although the structure of the transcriptional control elements in all cases was comparable to highly active elements found in lytically infected cells. Those findings and the localization of both virus types in the nuclei of blood cells by in situ hybridization demonstrate that JCV and BKV frequently infect peripheral leukocytes and give strong evidence that leukocytes are common sites of polyomavirus persistence in healthy individuals."

CD011926,0,23843485,0,Predictive diagnostics for Escherichia coli infections based on the clonal association of antimicrobial resistance and clinical outcome.,"The ability to identify bacterial pathogens at the subspecies level in clinical diagnostics is currently limited. We investigated whether splitting Escherichia coli species into clonal groups (clonotypes) predicts antimicrobial susceptibility or clinical outcome. A total of 1,679 extraintestinal E. coli isolates (collected from 2010 to 2012) were collected from one German and 5 U.S. clinical microbiology laboratories. Clonotype identity was determined by fumC and fimH (CH) sequencing. The associations of clonotype with antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical variables were evaluated. CH typing divided the isolates into >200 CH clonotypes, with 93% of the isolates belonging to clonotypes with ≥ 2 isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility varied substantially among clonotypes but was consistent across different locations. Clonotype-guided antimicrobial selection significantly reduced ""drug-bug"" mismatch compared to that which occurs with the use of conventional empirical therapy. With trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones, the drug-bug mismatch was predicted to decrease 62% and 78%, respectively. Recurrent or persistent urinary tract infection and clinical sepsis were significantly correlated with specific clonotypes, especially with CH40-30 (also known as H30), a recently described clonotype within sequence type 131 (ST131). We were able to clonotype directly from patient urine samples within 1 to 3 h of obtaining the specimen. In E. coli, subspecies-level identification by clonotyping can be used to significantly improve empirical predictions of antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical outcomes in a timely manner."

We report a thorough microbiological analysis of 1,688 lymph node biopsy specimens collected in our bartonellosis reference center. We studied lymph node biopsy samples from patients with suspected regional infectious lymph node enlargement from January 2008 to December 2012. To evaluate a useful strategy for the diagnosis of infectious lymphadenitis, specimens were cultured and subjected to molecular assays. Histologic analysis was done when possible. A total of 642 (38%) biopsy specimens were infected with a bacterial agent, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was significantly better than 16S rRNA gene PCR (rrs) for the detection of Bartonella henselae (P = 0.05), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (P = 0.05), and Mycobacterium avium (P = 0.007). Molecular assays were significantly better than bacterial cultures for the diagnosis of Francisella tularensis (P = 0.017) but were less effective for detecting M. tuberculosis (P = 0.004) and M. avium (P = 0.001). Histologic analysis was done for 412 lymph nodes, and 20% of these were compatible with an infectious lymphadenitis, whereas a neoplasm was found in 29% of these lymph nodes. M. tuberculosis was detected significantly more in female than in male patients (P = 0.01), and patients with cat scratch disease (CSD) were younger than patients with M. tuberculosis, Tropheryma whipplei, and F. tularensis. Negative rrs PCR does not exclude the diagnosis of infectious lymphadenitis. Histologic analysis of lymph node biopsy specimens is critical, as a diagnosis of infectious lymphadenitis does not preclude other concurrent diseases."

The role of maternal anti-HPV6/11 neutralizing antibodies in preventing the vertical transmission remains to be unknown because of lack of the neutralization assay system of HPV infection. We experienced two cases of HPV6-positive CA during pregnancy. Neutralizing antibodies against HPV6 in maternal, umbilical, and infantile sera were determined using a surrogate assay system to monitor HPV6 pseudo-infections. The neutralizing antibodies were detected in maternal and umbilical sera and in serum of one of the infants tested at 5 weeks old. In the infant exposed to HPV6 at birth, viral DNA was not detectable in the oral cavity 5 weeks after birth.

CD011926,0,23881085,0,Seasonality and prevalence of respiratory pathogens detected by multiplex PCR at a tertiary care medical center.,"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Seasonality has been reported for many viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the recently described human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We hypothesize that the availability of rapid, multiplex PCR diagnostics will provide better clinical care and new insights into the etiology and clinical spectrum of RTIs. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of respiratory pathogens at a 500-bed adult and 154-bed pediatric hospital tertiary care center. A total of 939 specimens from patients with an age range of 5 days to 91 years (median, 2 years) were tested by a multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012. Sixty-five percent of specimens were positive for at least one pathogen. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent (34.3 %) followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %). Twelve percent of the positive samples were positive for multiple analytes, with Rhino/Entero and RSV being the most common combination. The peak months were September and May for Rhino/Entero infections, January for RSV and February for coronavirus. hMPV peaked 2 months after RSV, as has been observed recently in other studies. Multiplex PCR provides rapid diagnostic information that can be used to make knowledgeable clinical decisions and potentially reduce the use of antibiotics. Active respiratory PCR surveillance could also predict seasonal respiratory epidemics to allow for adequate planning of additional infection control measures."

Our objectives were to perform a serological survey of medical personnel at the Chumphae Hospital in Thailand and to investigate the prevalence of pH1N1 in randomly selected patients diagnosed with respiratory tract disease. Prevalence of pH1N1 in the patients was determined by performing real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The study was carried out between July 2009 and November 2010. Seroprevalence of hemaglutination inhibition (HI) titers among medical personnel was established in three cross-sectional studies at the end of each wave of the pandemic by performing HI assay to detect antibodies against pH1N1. Infection by the pH1N1 peaked between July and October 2009; the second wave was from January to March 2010 and the third wave from June to November 2010. The HI titers after the first, second, and third waves were 48.2%, 22.4%, and 25.7%, respectively. After the second and third waves, 52.1% and 45.3% of the medical personnel who had received pH1N1 vaccination had HI titers ≥ 40. These findings show that seasonal influenza strain in Chumphae and the predominant influenza strain from each wave was pH1N1. HI assay results also represent the severity of the attack rate in each wave."

Samples were screened for HTLV-I/II antibodies by particle agglutination assay. All positive or borderline samples were then tested by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on C19 HTLV-II-producing cells. Western blot was used for confirmation of all IFA-positive plasma samples. The crude HTLV-II seroprevalence was 3.0% (62 of 2051), and 0.9% (5 of 588) in children less than 10 years old. The latter result suggests ongoing mother-to-child transmission, probably by breast feeding. There was a marked increase in HTLV-II seroprevalence with age (0.9%, 0-10 years; 1.6%, 11-20 years; 4.4%, 21-30 years; 3.4%, 31-40 years; 7.2%, 41-50 years; 5.7%, >50 years) in both male (p = 0.002) and female subjects (p = 0.00002). None of the 80 non-Indian inhabitants tested was HTLV-I/II seropositive. In a second study, among 105 Toba Indians from a village (Primavera) of the eastern part of this region, 23 were HTLV-II seropositive with a seroprevalence of 59% in those more than 40 years old. From seven of the Indians from Primavera, three others from neighboring regions (including two Tobas and one Pilaga), and one intravenous drug user (IVDU) from Rosario, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the gp21 transmembrane-encoding gene (590 bp) was amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. LTR sequences were also obtained from the Pilaga, the IVDU, and one Toba. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the Indians were all infected with closely related HTLV-II molecular strains belonging to the b subtype, while the IVDU was infected with an HTLV-II subtype a variant. Such data help to make a phylogenetic atlas of HTLV-II among Amerindian tribes and are crucial to gain new insights into the origin and modes of dissemination of this human retrovirus in the Americas."

They were investigated to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and to characterize the mechanisms of resistance to macrolide and tetracycline. All strains were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and quinupristin-dalfopristin. They were resistant to chloramphenicol (3.1%), rifampicin (19.1%), erythromycin (40%) and tetracycline (97.3%); 3.1% were highly resistant to streptomycin and 1.3% to gentamicin. Among the erythromycin-resistant isolates, 78.7% showed a constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) phenotype with high-level resistance to macrolides and clindamycin (MIC(50) >256 µg ml(-1)), 10% showed an inducible MLS(B) phenotype with high MICs of macrolides (MIC(50) >256 µg ml(-1)) and low MICs of clindamycin (MIC(50)=8 µg ml(-1)) and 2.2% showed an M phenotype with a low erythromycin-resistance level (MIC range=12-32 µg ml(-1)) and low MICs of clindamycin (MIC range: 0.75-1 µg ml(-1)). All strains were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid (MIC(90): 0.75 µg ml(-1) for each). MLS(B) phenotypes were genotypically confirmed by the presence of the erm(B) gene and the M phenotype by the mef(A) gene. Resistance to tetracycline was mainly due to the tet(M) gene (93.1%) encoding a ribosome protection mechanism. This determinant is commonly associated with the conjugative transposon Tn916 (P≤0.0002). tet(O) and tet(T) existed in a minority (2.2% and 0.4%, respectively).

This paper describes the investigation and highlights the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration for successful control of such outbreaks. There was a temporal cluster of 12 confirmed symptomatic cases of VTEC O157 and one asymptomatic carrier, from five families. The investigation revealed that four of these cases formed part of an outbreak involving two families who visited an open farm. The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the isolates from the two families and the putative farm animal contacts were indistinguishable, indicating that the animals were the source of the primary infections. No epidemiological link could be established between the remaining three families affected and the open farm or people having visited the farm. Control measures included improved hand washing facilities on the farm, information for visitors and staff, restricted access and suspended petting and feeding of animals, and thorough cleaning and disinfection of affected areas."

CD011926,0,15578191,0,Impaired mucosal regeneration in neonatal necrotising enterocolitis.,"Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) remains an overwhelming gastrointestinal (GI) emergency in premature infants, with an annual incidence of 350 cases and a mortality of 23% in the United Kingdom. The aetiology of NEC is multifactorial and its pathogenesis poorly understood. It is characterised by severe necrotic damage to the intestine. Mucus is an adherent, viscoelastic gel layer protecting the delicate underlying epithelium from lumenal aggressors such as digestive enzymes and bacterial toxins. The group of trefoil factor peptides (TFF1-3) are part of the protective mechanism operating in the intestinal mucosa and play a fundamental role in epithelial protection, repair, and restitution. These secreted peptides have been identified in a site-specific pattern in the GI mucosa, and their expression has been shown to be upregulated in early stages of mucosal repair. The role of trefoil peptides in neonatal mucosal protection has not been well investigated. Impaired mucosal regeneration due in part to failure of upregulation of TFF expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC. The aim of this study was to investigate TFF1-3 mRNA expression and to identify the gene product in the GI tracts of normal neonatal controls and infants with NEC. Parents of all babies having a laparotomy in the neonatal period (defined as up to 44 weeks' gestation) and bowel resection were approached for written consent. Bowel samples were fixed in formalin and then embedded in paraffin in an RNAse-free manner. In situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine the pattern of trefoil mRNA expression and to localise the peptides in the neonatal GI tract. Forty neonatal bowel specimens were examined. Twelve patients had NEC, eight were recovering from NEC, and 20 control specimens were obtained. TFF1 and TFF2 mRNA expression were not detected in the majority of NEC specimens, and there was a relative downregulation of TFF3 expression in 83% of NEC patients. TFF1 and TFF2 expression were noted in the recovery phase from NEC. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decrease in TFF3 gene product in sites adjacent to mucosal damage secondary to NEC. In acute NEC there was no apparent expression of TFF1 and 2 protein. In the group of patients recovering from NEC, TFF1 and 2 expression were seen in association with regenerative changes in the mucosa. Previous data has shown TFF1-3 to be upregulated in the acute phase response to mucosal injury in the gut. Trefoil peptides have been shown to promote epithelial cell migration and protect against apoptosis. Our results suggest that there is a lack of TFF expression in response to NEC in the premature gut. This may lead to impaired restitution of the mucosa and contribute to the cascade of bowel necrosis and generalised sepsis characteristic of NEC."

All consecutive overnight CSF Gram stains between 2006 and 2011 were included. The impact of a positive or a negative test on empirical therapy was evaluated and compared to other clinical and biological indications based on institutional guidelines. Bacterial CNS infection was documented in 51/241 suspected cases. Overnight CSF Gram stain was positive in 24/51. Upon validation, there were two false-positive and one false-negative results. The sensitivity and specificity were 41 and 99 %, respectively. All patients but one had other indications for empirical therapy than Gram stain alone. Upon obtaining the Gram result, empirical therapy was modified in 7/24, including the addition of an appropriate agent (1), addition of unnecessary agents (3) and simplification of unnecessary combination therapy (3/11). Among 74 cases with a negative CSF Gram stain and without formal indication for empirical therapy, antibiotics were withheld in only 29. Round-the-clock CSF Gram stain had a low impact on overnight empirical therapy for suspected CNS infections and was associated with several misinterpretation errors. Clinicians showed little confidence in CSF direct examination for simplifying or withholding therapy before definite microbiological results."

CD011926,0,20632037,0,The IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism and renal scarring in children with first acute pyelonephritis.,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in infants and children and may result in serious complications, such as renal scarring, hypertension, and renal failure. Identification of the new markers in relation to acute pyelonephritis (APN) and its treatment is essential for designing interventions that would minimize tissue damage. This prospective study investigated the first UTI infection in 71 children (age range: 1-24 months) in respect to interleukin-6 (IL-6) -174G/C polymorphism and renal scarring. The patients were divided into an APN group and a lower UTI group according to dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The IL-6 -174G/C genotypes were determined by tetra-primer ARMSPCR. Serum IL-6 was significantly higher in the APN group than in the group with lower UTI (p<0.05). In both groups, the -174G/C genotype and allele frequencies did not differ significantly from the control group. The highest white blood cell (WBC) count was observed in the CC genotype (p<0.05). A non-significant trend toward higher serum IL-6 was observed in children with CC genotype. On follow-up DMSA imaging performed 6 months later, renal scarring was detected in 36.9% of APN children. We did not find the significant association of IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism with APN and/or postinfectious renal scarring. These results indicate that serum IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in children with APN than in patients with lower UTI."

Sixty stool samples from apparently healthy children were used as controls. Rotavirus infections were diagnosed in 28 (14%) specimens using two enzyme immunoassays, (Abbott Laboratories' kit and monoclonal antibodies). PAGE, ELISA and PCR were used to determine electropherotypes, subgroups and serotypes respectively. The study of electropherotypes detected two migration patterns: a short one in 4 samples (14.3%) and a long pattern in 16 cases (57.1%). These results were verified by a specific subgroup monoclonal antibodies ELISA. The polymerase chain reaction showed that serotype 1 accounted for 46.4% of positive samples, while serotypes 3 and 4 present in 3.6% and 7.4% of the specimens respectively. Serotype 2 was not detected and 42.8% samples were untypable. Males between 0 and 12 months of age were the most affected.

CD011926,0,23202333,0,A point-of-care PCR test for HIV-1 detection in resource-limited settings.,"A low-cost, fully integrated sample-to-answer, quantitative PCR (qPCR) system that can be used for detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA in infants at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings has been developed and tested. The system is based on a novel DNA extraction method, which uses a glass fiber membrane, a disposable assay card that includes on-board reagent storage, provisions for thermal cycling and fluorescence detection, and a battery-operated portable analyzer. The system is capable of automated PCR mix assembly using a novel reagent delivery system and performing qPCR. HIV-1 and internal control targets are detected using two spectrally separated fluorophores, FAM and Quasar 670. In this report, a proof-of-concept of the platform is demonstrated. Initial results with whole blood demonstrate that the test is capable of detecting HIV-1 in blood samples containing greater than 5000 copies of HIV-1.

The epidemiology and pathophysiology of these infections remain unclear, notably because the causing agents are gathered in the artificial CoNS group. The aim of this work was to optimize the study of Staphylococcus species diversity in human breast milk and neonate stool, two sample types with bacterial communities dominated by CoNS, using PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis based on the tuf gene. The optimized protocol identified 18 Staphylococcus species involved in neonate gut microbiota and infections and was applied to cultivation-independent study of breast milk and neonate stool. The efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and species discrimination of the proposed protocol appears suitable for patient follow-up in order to link microbiological data at the community level in milk and stool and interpret them from epidemiological and pathophysiological points of view."
CD011926,0,20147645,0,Public hospital-based laboratory experience during an outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infections.,"The experience of a public hospital virology laboratory during a springtime 2009 outbreak of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in New York State is described. Influenza virus was isolated from 145 of 613 respiratory swab specimens. Symptoms of fever (temperature, 102.7 +/- 0.32 degrees F), cough, upper respiratory infection, myalgia, and headache were reported. Atypical symptoms of nausea/vomiting and diarrhea were also observed. Illness occurred mainly in patients <or=21 years of age (85/145 patients). Only two patients were >or=65 years old. Compared to the results of traditional culture methods, the sensitivities of a rapid chromatographic influenza A and B virus immunoassay and rapid shell vial culture were 70.3% and 98.6%, respectively. A sensitivity of 80% was obtained by testing 50 specimens by a direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) assay. The observation of adequate numbers of cells on the DFA assay slides suggests that the low sensitivity of the chromatographic immunoassay may result from its intrinsic nature and not from improper specimen collection. A reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay of 45 specimens performed off-site yielded 21 novel (H1N1) viruses and 2 seasonal (H3N2) influenza viruses. The mean time interval of 5.69 +/- 0.37 days from specimen collection to the availability of RT-PCR results limited the value of this assay for patient care. In laboratories lacking on-site molecular capabilities, shell vial techniques can rapidly (about 1 day) confirm negative results and/or identify false-negative chromatographic immunoassay results. Laboratories lacking culture capabilities may also use the DFA assay to confirm or replace the results obtained by these immunoassays. Increasing testing demands caused shortages in commodities and personnel. Alternative testing strategies and planning are necessary in order to optimize virus detection and ensure appropriate resource allocation."

The results showed 244 cases (73.27%) were diagnosed as P. vivax, 87 cases (26.13%) P. falciparum and 2 cases (0.6%) showed a mixed infection of both Plasmodia. In a molecular study of the same samples using nested-polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR), 185 cases (55.6%) were P. vivax, 50 cases (15%) P. falciparum and 95 cases (29%) both Plasmodia. Comparing the two methods used in this study, the highest rate of infection was found to be P. vivax. However, the rate of mixed infections (0.6% microscopy, 29% nested-PCR) varied and depended on the assay used. This indicated that the sensitivity of nested-PCR was greater than microscopic examination, especially for the detection of mixed-infections (p<0.05) in the current malaria epidemiology study."

CD011926,0,1586873,0,Viruses as precipitants of asthma symptoms. I. Epidemiology.,"The epidemiological studies cited have indicated that viruses are commonly associated with wheezing illnesses in populations, in individuals, and in time, but, unlike bacteria, are rarely found during asymptomatic periods. Viruses have been identified in up to 50% of wheezing illnesses and asthma exacerbations occurring in childhood, and in up to 20% of those in adults. In childhood the predominant organisms identified have been rhinoviruses. RSV and parainfluenza viruses, but coronaviruses have not been studied adequately. Wheezing appears to be more common during rhinovirus and RSV than other virus infections in children spontaneously presenting with respiratory infections to medical care, but all virus groups have been incriminated, and in general, wheezing occurs in upwards of 50% of viral infections in asthmatics followed prospectively. The few adult studies available show little difference between viruses in identification rates during wheezing, or propensity to result in wheezing. The predominant viruses change with age, and children with asthma seem to be more prone to symptomatic virus infections than other children, although the presence of atopy alone does not appear to be important. There are important gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of virus-associated wheezing attacks, and further prospective studies are required, using early investigation and sensitive methods for identifying rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, to study severe asthma in children and adults. It is hoped that the use of nucleic acid hybridization and newer antigen-detection techniques will improve the ability to identify difficult viruses such as coronaviruses and rhinoviruses in the future. The ability to identify subclinical infections and compare the ratio of subclinical to clinical infections in normal and asthmatic children would be useful but would require intense monitoring of both groups for an extended period (minimum 12 months to cover seasonal variation) with full virological studies every 2-4 weeks-a difficult and expensive task. Another important line of study would be to prospectively document indoor aeroallergen exposure and virus infections in the same individuals, and compare their importance as precipitants of acute severe asthma attacks. With a clearer understanding of the groups at risk for asthma attacks, and the factors which put them at risk and precipitate their attacks, effective preventive strategies will become more feasible."
CD011926,0,3439718,0,Recovery of HIV-related retroviruses from Italian patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex and from asymptomatic at-risk individuals.,"Human retroviruses have been detected in supernatants of cultures of Ficoll-enriched lymphocytes from peripheral blood, lymph nodes and bone marrow of (a) 32 out of 42 patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), (b) 34 out of 64 patients with AIDS-related Complex (ARC), (c) 9 out of 18 asymptomatic children born from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) seropositive mothers, and (d) 9 out of 28 asymptomatic drug abusers or hemophiliacs. Virus detection was monitored by assaying culture supernatants for the presence of Mg++-dependent reverse transcriptase (R.T.) activity. A number of these virus-positive sups were passaged repeatedly in cultures of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) treated fresh lymphocytes from healthy blood donors. Occasionally, multiple samples were obtained at varying time intervals from the same patient and consistently yielded detectable retroviral activity. Several isolates were characterized as closely related if not identical to HIV, HTLV-IIIB strain, since cells from either patients' own lymphocyte cultures or subcultures infected with passaged virus were stained in an indirect immunofluorescent assay with both patients sera and monoclonal antibody against p24 antigen of the HTLV-IIIB strain. Representative isolates, grown on fresh lymphocytes of healthy donors and metabolically labelled with 35S-cysteine, were also analyzed in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) against patients' sera to define their antigenic pattern, which was widely superimposable to that obtained with HTLV-IIIB-infected H9 cells. DNA from lymphocytes infected with 2 representative isolates were Southern-blotted and probed with an insert from a plasmid containing the entire genome of the HTLV-IIIB strain. The hybridization patterns were comparable with those obtained with DNA from H9-infected cells."

CD011926,0,12744623,0,Plasma endothelin-1 in infants and young children with acute bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Infections that occur during the first three years of life have been demonstrated to be associated with the development of childhood asthma. The mechanism of virus-triggered airway inflammation Is not fully understood. Endothelin-1 is a potent bronchoconstrictor involved in many diseases including respiratory tract infections. Infants and young children diagnosed with either viral pneumonia or acute bronchiolitis, their age ranging between 2 months and 3 years, were recruited into this study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken for detection of respiratory virus by antigen immunofluorescence stain, RT-PCR analysis and viral culture. Plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) was measured by using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Ten of the nineteen infants and children (52%) were positive for RSV infection, one co-infected with influenza A. Nine Infants (90%) were positive for RSV subtype A. There was only one infant with subtype B. One of the RSV negative individuals was positive for influenza A. In addition, we recruited 10 patients without chronic underlying or respiratory tract illness as controls. ET-1 levels were significantly increased in RSV infection compared to the controls (3.6 +/- 1.2 and 1.2 +/- 1 pg/ml, respectively (p < 0.05). In conclusion, infants and young children who are infected with RSV have an increase in circulating plasma endothelin-1. This in turn may contribute to the subsequent development of childhood asthma."
CD011926,0,7559940,0,PCR ribotyping and arbitrarily primed PCR for typing strains of Clostridium difficile from a Polish maternity hospital.,"Detection of the source of Clostridium difficile strains is of importance for the control of the nosocomial spread of this microorganism. For this purpose, vaginal and rectal swabs from 183 mothers, duplicate fecal samples (taken on days 1 and 4 after birth) from 183 neonates, and 94 environmental samples were cultured for C. difficile. The microorganism was never detected in the meconium obtained on day 1 after birth. On the other hand, an incidence of 17% C. difficile positivity was noted in the fecal samples obtained on day 4 after birth. Forty-two percent of the 31 colonized neonates had been delivered with complications. The bacteria were never encountered in the rectal swabs of the mothers, and C. difficile was identified in only one vaginal swab. In contrast, 13% of the environmental samples were positive for C. difficile. No major difference was encountered between patient and environmental isolates with respect to toxigenicity (58 to 65% toxigenic isolates). All strains were subsequently typed by PCR amplification of the 16S-23S ribosomal intergenic spacer regions and by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) with different primers and combinations thereof. All environmental isolates and 11 of 31 neonatal strains were of a single type. The vaginal strain was unique, and among the maternity ward- and neonate-related isolates, only two additional AP-PCR types were identified. When a collection of C. difficile strains from patients hospitalized in other institutions and suffering from antibiotic-associated diarrhea or pseudomembranous colitis was analyzed in a similar manner, it appeared that the strain from the maternity ward was unique. The other strain commonly encountered among the neonates was also identified frequently among the isolates from patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea or pseudomembranous colitis, indicating its general occurrence. On the basis of both epidemiological studies and PCR-mediated genotyping, it was shown that the environment and not the birth canal is the major source of C. difficile acquisition by neonates in this maternity hospital setting. Furthermore, AP-PCR appears to be a fast and useful method for epidemiologically relevant typing of C. difficile isolates."

The level of C-reactive protein on day 5 compared with day 2 was increased in spite of negative urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. The blood sampled on day 6 was found to be positive for lactobacilli, and the isolate was pre-identified as L. rhamnosus or Lactobacillus casei on day 11. The strain identity was then verified as L. rhamnosus GG through PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. Genotyping with the rep-PCR and AFLP methods confirmed the 100% genetic similarity for both the strain isolated from patient blood and the probiotic product. The newborn became touch-sensitive, cried a lot, had worsening laboratory test results, and increased inflammation parameters, but no fever was observed. After a further 9 days of antibiotic therapy, blood cultures became negative, and laboratory tests improved on day 25. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 27 days. IUGR with a possible link to L. rhamnosus GG bacteraemia might be a new potential risk group, beside patients with organ failure, immunocompromised status and dysfunctional gut barrier mechanisms, for which safe use of probiotics needs careful attention. Universally accepted or improved guidelines for the safer administration of probiotics in risk groups are urgently needed. This report should not discourage the use of probiotics, but should highlight the need for their careful use in IUGR patients."
CD011926,0,26153285,0,Perinatal management of fetal supraventricular tachycardia complicated by maternal pertussis.,"Prenatal pertussis has become a concern once again with the reappearance of the disease in the USA. A 30-year-old mother whose pregnancy was complicated with fetal arrhythmia was referred for further evaluation in the third trimester. After initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications due to continued irregular rhythm, she was revisited for persistent hacking cough at 38 weeks gestational age. PCR examination confirmed pertussis diagnosis. Owing to increased risk of digoxin toxicity with concurrent antibiotic administration, antiarrhythmic medication was discontinued. Delivery was induced 2 days after the initiation of azithromycin therapy to prevent the transmission of the disease to the neonate. A well-planned delivery in a patient with prenatal diagnosis prevents neonatal infection while considering the obstetrical dilemma for concurrent management of the intrauterine arrhythmia and antibiotic administration."
CD011926,0,21767704,0,Comparison of an ELISA and two reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods for norovirus detection.,"Noroviruses are uncultivable; ELISA and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods are therefore widely used for their detection. Sixty-one sporadic, diarrhoeal stool samples from various university hospital wards and from outpatients in Szeged, Hungary, were examined. Three methods were compared: two RT-PCR methods (the Argene Calici/Astrovirus Consensus kit and the Cepheid Norovirus Primer and Probe Set) and one ELISA method (the IDEIA™ Norovirus ELISA Test). Sensitivities of 78.9%, 92.8%, and 91.2%, and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 100% were found for the IDEIA™ Norovirus ELISA, the Argene kit, and the Cepheid kit, respectively. The PCR and ELISA systems detected 52 norovirus-positive samples, one of which belonged to genogroup I and all the others to genogroup II. Although the ELISA kit has a lower sensitivity compared to the PCR ones, it can be useful for large-scale testing. However, ELISA-negative outbreaks should be retested by RT-PCR methods. Our results suggest that noroviruses, and predominantly genogroup II of the norovirus genera, play an important role in outbreaks and sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis, not only in infants and young children, but also in adults."

CD011926,0,11560207,0,Intrapartum zidovudine infusion alone failed to reduce both maternal HIV-1 viral load and HIV-1 infection in infant.,"A pilot clinical trial to assess the efficacy of intrapartum zidovudine (ZDV) infusion alone in the reduction of maternal viral load and its potential role in preventing vertical transmission of HIV-1. Twenty six, asymptomatic antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected pregnant women who had no prior antenatal care and were in labor were enrolled. Each patient received ZDV infusion at the rate of 2 mg/kg within the first hour. ZDV was then continuously infused at 1 mg/kg/h until delivery. Maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA prior to the commencement of ZDV infusion and within an hour after delivery were measured. HIV-1 transmission was documented by nested polymerase chain reaction in infants at six months of age. Median maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA prior to the ZDV infusion and after delivery was 29,401 and 32,555 copies/ml respectively, (p>0.05). The estimated HIV-1 transmission rate was 19.2 per cent (95% CI = 4-34). This result suggested that in asymptomatic HIV-1 infected pregnant women who were antiretroviral naïve and had no prior antenatal care, intrapartum ZDV infusion alone failed to reduce maternal HIV-1 viremia and the transmission rate of HIV-1."

CD011926,0,26255774,0,Diversity in KIR gene repertoire in HIV-1 exposed infected and uninfected infants: A study from India.,"Natural killer (NK) cells have antiviral activity mediated through killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs). Studies have shown the importance of KIR receptors in HIV infection. However reports on association of KIR genes in HIV infection from Indian population are limited, not a single study is reported in HIV exposed uninfected (EU) and infected infants. This study compared the KIR gene repertoire of HIV-1 positive (n = 29) with EU (n = 76) infants to elucidate its association with transmission. KIR genotyping was analysed using the PCR-SSP method. Viral load of mothers, CD4 count of both mothers and infected infants were done using commercial kits. The data was analysed using SPSS software. Results revealed presence of significantly high frequencies of activating gene KIR 2DS5 (P = 0.040) and inhibitory gene KIR 2DL3 (P = 0.013) in EU infants as compared to HIV-1 positive infants, confirmed with multivariable linear regression modelling. Fifty-nine KIR genotypes were identified in these 105 infants. Nine genotypes were unique, reported for the first time. Twenty six genotypes were shared with the World populations. Twenty four genotypes were reported for the first time from India. Specific KIR genotype combinations (GIDs) were exclusively present either in HIV-1 positive (n = 19) or in EU infants (n = 30). The Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis shows a strong linkage between four pairs of genes in HIV-1 positive and three pairs of genes in EU infants. In conclusion, this study revealed that, besides maternal confounding factors such as ART and viral load, specific KIR genes are associated independently with perinatal HIV infection."

Among these, G2 denotes a different genogroup which appears to have a cyclic pattern of occurrence and yet little information is available about its genetic variability. The aim of this report was to characterize the emergence of G2 genotype in Paraupebas, Southern Pará State, Brazil, some of which detected after introduction of rotavirus vaccine. A total of 241 fecal specimens from young children with acute gastroenteritis were collected from the ""Yutaka Takeda Hospital,"" a Municipality Hospital, and at the Parauapebas' Health Unit, Pará, from January to September 2006 and during March to November 2008. All samples were tested for rotavirus using immunochromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and RT-PCR, yielding an overall positivity of 12.45% (30/241). Rotavirus G2P[4] was identified in 27 of 30 samples (90%), followed by G1P[8] (2/30, 6.67%) and G9P[8] (1/30, 3.33%). Phylogenetic analysis was performed in 15 of the G2 strains, all of which grouped into lineage II. Four of these strains clustered into sublineage II-a (year 2006) and 11 into one possible new sublineage named II-c (year 2008, except SAL-1920-C). The recent re-emergence of G2 genotype associated with lineage II in Brazil warrants the continuous monitoring of circulating rotavirus strains following the nationwide universal use of rotavirus vaccine."

Forty-three children (mean age 2.7 years) hospitalized for suspected meningitis or fever of unclear etiology were enrolled. EV-PCR was performed on a daily basis. Results were available in less than 2 days in 72% of cases. EV-PCR was positive in nine (21%) children, including three infants without CSF pleocytosis. Knowing their EV-PCR result would have allowed a saving of 18 hospital days and 12 days of antibiotic therapy.

The study was based on identifying IgG and IgM specific antibodies. All tests were done in the Department of Immunology. Women with serologically diagnosed primary infection were offered further follow up, antibiotic therapy and care during delivery in the Institute of Mother and Child. Children born by infected mothers were examined serologically and observed in terms of congenital abnormality. There were 1294 (64.19%) seronegative; 722 (35.81%) were infected before pregnancy (the presence of IgG antibodies).

This new method was used to examine babies delivered by HTLV-I carrier women for HTLV-I vertical transmission. It was found that intra-uterine infection with HTLV-I can occur, though rarely, and some babies carry HTLV-I provirus despite their negative response to HTLV-I antibody, and, noticeably, some of the babies found negative by the conventional antigen detection method may be positive when tested by the PCR method. It was also confirmed with the PCR method that the incidence of vertical transmission of HTLV-I can be reduced to about 1/5 by replacing breast feeding with bottle feeding and frozen mother's milk feeding. It was also found that vertical transmission of HTLV-I can occur at high incidence rates even when the duration of breast feeding is 3 months or less."

CD011926,0,11865552,0,[Nosocomial infections due to human coronaviruses in the newborn].,"Human coronaviruses, with two known serogroups named 229-E and OC-43, are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. The large RNA is surrounded by a nucleoprotein (protein N). The envelop contains 2 or 3 glycoproteins: spike protein (or protein S), matrix protein (or protein M) and a hemagglutinin (or protein HE). Their pathogen role remains unclear because their isolation is difficult. Reliable and rapid methods as immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction allow new researches on epidemiology. Human coronaviruses can survive for as long as 6 days in suspension and 3 hours after drying on surfaces, suggesting that they could be a source of hospital-acquired infections. Two prospective studies conducted in a neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit demonstrated a significant association of coronavirus-positive nasopharyngal samples with respiratory illness in hospitalised preterm neonates. Positive samples from staff suggested either a patient-to-staff or a staff-to-patient transmission. No cross-infection were observed from community-acquired respiratory-syncitial virus or influenza-infected children to neonates.

We aimed to assess prevalence of HPV infection in nonmalignant tonsillar crypt epithelia and to histopathologically characterise positive samples. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tonsil tissue specimens were obtained from an age- and sex-stratified random sample of patients aged 0-69 years whose paired tonsils were archived following elective tonsillectomy at hospitals throughout England and Southern Scotland from 2004 to 2008. Homogenised fresh-frozen tonsil tissue was also obtained from archive for two random subsets of males aged 25-34 and over 44. HPV status was assessed in all samples for 20 mucosal HPV types by GP5+/6+ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enzyme immunoassay and by HPV16 type-specific PCR targeting the E6 gene. In the homogenised material, HPV status was also assessed for 44 HPV types by SPF10-PCR enzyme immunoassay. Of 4,095 randomly sampled FFPE specimens, amplifiable DNA was extracted from 3,377 (82.5%) and from 511 of 524 (97.5%) homogenised tonsils. HPV DNA was identified in 0 of 3,377 (0%, 95% CI 0-0.089%) fixed samples and 0 of 511 (0%, 95% CI 0-0.58%) homogenised samples. This suggests HPV infection may be rare in tonsil reticulated crypt epithelia. Furthermore, we found no evidence of HPV-associated premalignant neoplasia. These data suggest that if HPV-associated premalignant lesions do occur, they are likely to be rare and may have a high risk of progression to carcinoma."

This 96-well method allows simultaneous quantification of bacteria in the presence and absence of antibiotics. A method for determining precise MICs and a method for screening against multiple antibiotics using breakpoint thresholds are detailed. Of the 61 Ureaplasma-positive clinical isolates screened, one (1.6%) was resistant to erythromycin (MIC, >64 mg/liter) and clarithromycin (MIC, 4 mg/liter), one to ciprofloxacin (1.6%), and one to tetracycline/doxycycline (1.6%). Five isolates were also consistently found to have an elevated MIC of 8 mg/liter for erythromycin, but this may not represent true antibiotic resistance, as no mutations were found in the 23S rRNA operons or ribosome-associated L4 and L22 proteins for these strains. However, two amino acids (R66Q67) were deleted from the L4 protein of the erythromycin-/clarithromycin-resistant strain. The tetM genetic element was detected in the tetracycline-resistant clinical isolate as well as in the positive control Vancouver strain serotype 9. The tetM gene was also found in a fully tetracycline-susceptible Ureaplasma clinical isolate, and no mutations were found in the coding region that would explain its failure to mediate tetracycline resistance. An amino acid substitution (D82N) was found in the ParC subunit of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolate, adjacent to the S83L mutation reported by other investigators in many ciprofloxacin-resistant Ureaplasma isolates. It is now possible to detect antibiotic resistance in Ureaplasma within 48 h of positive culture without prior knowledge of bacterial load, identifying them for further molecular analysis."

Unfortunately, after the first 2 weeks of life, usual diagnostic techniques for CMV detection (viral culture and serology) are useless to differentiate congenital infection from post-natal acquired infection, whereas detection of viral DNA from dried blood spots (DBS; Guthrie cards), systematically collected from all newborns in the first days of life, has been described for late diagnosis of CMV congenital infection. The aim of our study was to choose and optimise a viral DNA extraction method from DBS and to study if CMV DNA detection is reliable when DBS are stored for 1 year at room temperature or 2 months at 37 degrees C. 10 reference cards (blood collected from CMV seronegative newborns (IgG/IgM negative) were ""infected"" with serial dilutions of virus and spotted on Guthrie cards) were tested. 3 extraction methods were evaluated, products of PCR were analyzes by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantification of CMV from DBS was also performed. Analysis of the results obtained from reference cards showed higher sensitivity of phenol/chloroform extraction following treatment with proteinase K, compared to heat extraction in cell culture medium or extraction with a commercial kit. We did not observe quantitative loss of viral DNA after 1 year storage at room temperature. CMV DNA detection from Guthrie cards could become a very useful tool for retrospective diagnosis of congenital CMV infection when sequelae are diagnosed in the first years of life.

CD011926,0,25694528,0,Contribution of neonatal amniotic fluid testing to diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis.,"We evaluated the molecular diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) on neonatal amniotic fluid samples from 488 mother-child pairs. Maternal infection during pregnancy was diagnosed and dated or could not be ruled out. Forty-six cases of CT were defined according to the European Research Network on CT classification system and case definitions. Neonatal amniotic fluid testing had an overall sensitivity of 54% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 39 to 69%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 99 to 100%). Its sensitivity was 33% (95% CI, 13 to 59%) when antenatal diagnosis was positive and 68% (95% CI, 48 to 84%) when antenatal diagnosis was negative or lacking. This difference in sensitivity may have been due to treatment of antenatally diagnosed cases. Relative to postnatal serology, neonatal amniotic fluid testing allowed an earlier diagnosis to be made in 26% of the cases (95% CI, 9 to 51%)."

This report from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, examines the risk factors for HIV transmission by 1 and 24 months among breast-feeding women. Eligible HIV-1-seropositive pregnant women enrolled in this randomized double-blind clinical trial were randomly assigned to receive either oral zidovudine (ZDV) (n = 126) prophylaxis or placebo (n = 124). Maternal prophylaxis began at 36 weeks of gestation (300 mg ZDV twice daily antepartum and 300 mg every 3 hours intrapartum); there was no neonatal prophylaxis component. The cumulative risk of transmission in the treatment group was 11.9% and 22.1% by 1 and 24 months, respectively. In adjusted analyses, viral load at enrollment was the strongest predictor of transmission (per log increment: odds ratio [OR] = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-9.5 at 1 month; OR = 5.7; 95% CI: 3.1-10.8 at 24 months). Overall, ZDV prophylaxis was not significantly protective for infection at 1 or 24 months. Comparing ZDV with placebo following dichotomization of viral load (<50,000 vs. > or =50,000 copies/mL) at enrollment, however, there was a significant effect of ZDV seen only among those women with a low viral load at enrollment. The substantial risk of transmission despite ZDV prophylaxis, particularly among those with higher viral loads, underscores the need to find more effective regimens appropriate for use in resource-limited settings."

The organism was coagulase positive but staphyloslide negative, and this unusual phenotype facilitated early recognition of the organism in the routine laboratory. In the initial outbreak there were 77 probable or confirmed cases, with a peak attack rate of 66%. Increased infection control measures were put in place and attempts were made to identify a staff carrier. No carriers were found and the major outbreak subsided. Sporadic cases occurred over the following 10 months, until May 1992, when a colonized staffperson was discovered. She was treated and no further cases occurred. The causative organism was subjected to typing by phage, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence polymerase chain reaction, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with two separate enzymes. The phage typing and genomic tests confirmed the presence of the same clone in the unit for 9 months. The organism possessed genes encoding exfoliative toxin A as determined by polymerase chain reaction."

CD011926,0,23254135,0,Pseudo-outbreak of vancomycin-resistant-enterococcus (VRE) Colonization in a neonatal intensive care unit using spectra VRE surveillance medium.,"From November 2011 through March 2012, we surveyed 272 babies in our neonatal intensive care unit for rectal colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Using Spectra VRE medium (Remel Diagnostics, Lenexa, KS), we identified one neonate colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. In addition, 55 (13%) of the surveillance cultures yielded false-positive results with vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. During the same time period, 580 rectal swabs were collected from adult patients resulting in 20 (3%) false-positive cultures. The difference in false-positive rates between cultures from babies and adults was statistically significant (P < 0.001), prompting an investigation of factors that might influence the elevated false-positive rate in the neonates including patient demographics, nutrition, and topical ointments applied at the time of testing. Older neonates, with a median age of 6 weeks, were more likely to have false-positive cultures than younger neonates with a median age of 3 weeks (P < 0.001). The younger neonates receiving Similac Expert Care products were less likely to have false-positive surveillance cultures than those receiving other formulas (P < 0.001). Application of topical products was not associated with false-positive cultures. The false-positive E. faecalis strains were typed by Diversilab Rep-PCR (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and found to represent eight different groups of isolates. The utility of the Spectra VRE media appeared to be significantly impacted by the age of the patients screened."
CD011926,0,11910508,0,Lung pathology in premature infants with Ureaplasma urealyticum infection.,"Respiratory tract colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum in preterm infants has been associated with a higher incidence of pneumonia, severe respiratory failure, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and death. In this report, we characterize the lung pathology and expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) associated with U. urealyticum pneumonia in very low-birth weight infants (VLBW; < or =1500 g). Lung pathology of archived autopsy specimens was retrospectively reviewed in three groups of VLBW infants: 5 gestational controls who died from nonpulmonary causes, 13 infants with pneumonia who were culture and/or PCR negative for U. urealyticum, and 5 infants with pulmonary disease and positive for U. urealyticum by tracheal aspirate and/or lung tissue culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Presence and extent of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, as well as interstitial lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis were evaluated. PCR was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung sections. Additional sections were immunostained for TNF-alpha. The peripheral total white blood cell counts and absolute neutrophil counts were three-fold higher in infants with U. urealyticum pneumonia than cell counts in infants infected with other organisms. There was a trend toward a predominance of neutrophils in alveoli of non- Ureaplasma pneumonia infants, but a trend toward a predominance of alveolar macrophages in U. urealyticum-infected infants. The most striking finding was the presence of increased interstitial fibrosis in all Ureaplasma-infected infants. TNF-alpha immunoreactive cell density was very low in the gestational controls, but increased in both pneumonia groups. We conclude that persistent lung U. urealyticum infection may contribute to chronic inflammation and early fibrosis in the preterm lung."
CD011926,0,15815011,0,Molecular identification of mumps virus genotypes from clinical samples: standardized method of analysis.,"A sensitive nested reverse transcription-PCR assay, targeting a short fragment of the gene encoding the small hydrophobic protein (SH gene), was developed to allow rapid characterization of mumps virus in clinical samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were established using representative genotypes A, B, C, D, E, and F. Mumps virus RNA was characterized directly from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and in extracts of mumps virus isolates from patients with various clinical syndromes. Direct sequencing of products and subsequent phylogenetic analysis enabled genetic classification. A simple web-based system of sequence analysis was established. The study also allowed characterization of mumps virus strains from Argentina as part of a new subgenotype. This PCR assay for characterization of mumps infections coupled to a web-based analytical program provides a rapid method for identification of known and novel strains."

Infection of the fetus occurred after recurrent maternal infection. The second, male, fetus did not have CMV infection. The cesarean section was performed at the 38th week of gestation. The birth weight of the infected girl was 1680g, the main symptoms, beside dystrophy, concerned the central nervous system: microcephaly, brain atrophy, hydrocephalus, corpus callosum agenesis. She also had Turner syndrome symptoms. The viral load was highest in the urine 81.2 x10^6/ml, in the cerebro-spinal fluid 15.4x10^6/ml and lower in blood 0.38 x10^5/ml. The concentration of specific IgG was 308 U/ml. Specific IgM was not detected. Throughout hospitalization, the infection maintained only one viral genotype gB2. Despite treatment with ganciclovir (10 weeks) and foscarnet (2 weeks), the girl died at the age of 8 months. Novel molecular diagnostic techniques (nested and real time PCR) confirmed the congenital infection and were helpful in the monitoring of the infection and treatment efficacy."

CD011926,0,15815014,0,Clinical manifestations of staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome depend on serotypes of exfoliative toxins.,"We sought a possible correlation between the clinical manifestations of staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS) and the serotype of exfoliative toxins (ET) by PCR screening of the eta and etb genes in Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from 103 patients with generalized SSSS and 95 patients with bullous impetigo. The eta gene and the etb gene were detected in, respectively, 31 (30%) and 20 (19%) episodes of generalized SSSS and 57 (60%) and 5 (5%) episodes of bullous impetigo. Both genes were detected in 52 (50%) episodes of generalized SSS and 33 (35%) episodes of bullous impetigo. To explain this link between etb and generalized SSSS, we examined the distribution of ETA- and ETB-specific antibodies in the healthy population (n = 175) and found that the anti-ETB antibody titer was lower than the anti-ETA titer. Thus, ETA is associated with bullous impetigo and ETB is associated with generalized SSSS, possibly owing to a lower titer of anti-ETB neutralizing antibodies in the general population."

CD011926,0,16517893,0,Prophagic DNA fragments in Streptococcus agalactiae strains and association with neonatal meningitis.,"We identified-by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis at the population level followed by DNA differential display, cloning, and sequencing-three prophage DNA fragments (F5, F7, and F10) in Streptococcus agalactiae that displayed significant sequence similarity to the DNA of S. agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The F5 sequence aligned with a prophagic gene encoding the large subunit of a terminase, F7 aligned with a phage-associated cell wall hydrolase and a phage-associated lysin, and F10 aligned with a transcriptional regulator (ArpU family) and a phage-associated endonuclease. We first determined the prevalence of F5, F7, and F10 by PCR in a collection of 109 strains isolated in the 1980s and divided into two populations: one with a high risk of causing meningitis (HR group) and the other with a lower risk of causing meningitis (LR group). These fragments were significantly more prevalent in the HR group than in the LR group (P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that lysogeny has increased the ability of some S. agalactiae strains to invade the neonatal brain endothelium. We then determined the prevalence of F5, F7, and F10 by PCR in a collection of 40 strains recently isolated from neonatal meningitis cases for comparison with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) strains isolated in the 1980s. The prevalence of the three prophage DNA fragments was similar in these two populations isolated 15 years apart. We suggest that the prophage DNA fragments identified have remained stable in many CSF S. agalactiae strains, possibly due to their importance in virulence or fitness."
CD011926,0,25637646,0,Association of Rotavirus With Seizures Accompanied by Cerebral White Matter Injury in Neonates.,"We aimed to identify whether rotavirus, human parechovirus, or enterovirus are causative or associated viral pathogens of seizures accompanied by diffuse cerebral white matter injury in neonates. Thirty neonates who presented with seizures and diffusion-restriction in the widespread bilateral cerebral white matter on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in this study. All patients were tested for rotavirus, human parechovirus, and enterovirus by using reverse transcription PCR. Stool, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum samples were examined in 30, 25, and 20 patients, respectively. Rotavirus was detected in stool samples from all 30 patients (100%). Stool samples from 5 patients (16.7%) were also positive for enterovirus. Rotavirus or human parechovirus were not detected in any cerebrospinal fluid samples from 25 patients, but 1 patient tested positive for enterovirus. No virus was detected in any of 20 patient sera. This study indicated an association between rotavirus and seizures accompanied by diffuse cerebral white matter lesions in neonates."
CD011926,0,12967746,0,Colony morphology switching of Candida lusitaniae and acquisition of multidrug resistance during treatment of a renal infection in a newborn: case report and review of the literature.,"Candida lusitaniae is an emerging opportunistic pathogen which exhibits an unusual antifungal susceptibility pattern. We describe a case of fatal renal infection due to C. lusitaniae in a very low birth weight neonate who was treated with short courses of fluconazole given alternately with amphotericin B. A colony morphology switching was detected on the standard primary culture medium by changes in colony size. Switching was shown to affect deeply the susceptibility to amphotericin B. Afterwards, the switched phenotype developed a cross resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole. Several issues raised by this case are discussed in the light of an extensive review of the literature. Our observations point out the importance of both the detection of colony morphology switching and the close monitoring of antifungal susceptibility in the management of infections due to C. lusitaniae. A judicious therapeutic strategy should prevent the acquisition of multidrug resistance during antifungal therapy."
CD011926,0,18551600,0,Study of influenza C virus infection in France.,"From November 2004 to April 2007, specimens were obtained from 2,281 patients with acute respiratory tract illness in Normandy, France. Eighteen strains of influenza C virus were detected in these samples using a combined tissue culture/RT-PCR diagnostic method. Most patients with influenza C virus infection (13/18) were infants or young children (<2 years of age). The most frequent symptoms were fever and cough, and the clinical presentation of influenza C virus infection was similar to that of other respiratory viruses. Thirteen of the 18 infected patients were hospitalized; 3 presented with a severe lower respiratory infection. The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of 10 isolates was sequenced to determine the lineages of the circulating influenza C viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the isolated strains had an HE gene belonging to the C/Yamagata/26/81-related lineage. These results show that influenza C virus regularly circulates in Normandy and generally causes a mild upper respiratory infection. Because the differential clinical diagnosis of influenza C virus infection is not always easy, it is important to identify viral strains for both patient management and epidemiological purposes."

Early definitive diagnosis of HIV requires virologic testing such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is the diagnostic standard in resource-rich settings but has been too complex and expensive for widespread use in most countries with high HIV prevalence. Early PCR testing can help HIV-infected infants access treatment, provide psychosocial benefits for families of uninfected infants, and help programs for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV monitor their effectiveness. HIV testing, including PCR, is increasingly available for infants in resource-limited settings, but there are many barriers and complex policy decisions that need to be addressed before universal early testing can become standard. This paper reviews challenges and progress in the field and suggests ways to facilitate early infant testing in resource-limited settings."
CD011926,0,26391432,0,"Congenital cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy: a review of prevalence, clinical features, diagnosis and prevention.","Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is under-recognised, despite being the leading infectious cause of congenital malformation, affecting ~0.3% of Australian live births. Approximately 11% of infants born with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic, resulting in clinical manifestations, including jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, petechiae, microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction and death. Congenital CMV infection may cause severe long-term sequelae, including progressive sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delay in 40-58% of symptomatic neonates, and ~14% of initially asymptomatic infected neonates. Up to 50% of maternal CMV infections have nonspecific clinical manifestations, and most remain undetected unless specific serological testing is undertaken. The combination of serology tests for CMV-specific IgM, IgG and IgG avidity provide improved distinction between primary and secondary maternal infections. In pregnancies with confirmed primary maternal CMV infection, amniocentesis with CMV-PCR performed on amniotic fluid, undertaken after 21-22 weeks gestation, may determine whether maternofetal virus transmission has occurred. Ultrasound and, to a lesser extent, magnetic resonance imaging are valuable tools to assess fetal structural and growth abnormalities, although the absence of fetal abnormalities does not exclude fetal damage. Diagnosis of congenital CMV infection at birth or in the first 3 weeks of an infant's life is crucial, as this should prompt interventions for prevention of delayed-onset hearing loss and neurodevelopmental delay in affected infants. Prevention strategies should also target mothers because increased awareness and hygiene measures may reduce maternal infection. Recognition of the importance of CMV in pregnancy and in neonates is increasingly needed, particularly as therapeutic and preventive interventions expand for this serious problem."
CD011926,0,18098155,0,Acute gastroenteritis cases associated with noroviruses infection in the state of Rio de Janeiro.,"In March 2005, the Epidemiological Surveillance Service of Resende, municipality of the Middle Paraiba Valley, State of Rio de Janeiro, reported a sudden spontaneous occurrence of acute gastroenteritis cases in children in a public day care center. Further, between May and June 2005, gastroenteritis outbreaks or sporadic cases of gastroenteritis were reported in two other municipalities, Piraí and Rio Claro, also located in the Middle Paraiba Valley. From March to June 2005, 50 fecal samples were collected in this region and those samples were tested for the presence of bacteria and other parasites and were demonstrated to be negative. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an enzyme immunoassay were performed for adenovirus and rotavirus detection and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to investigate the presence of norovirus (NoV) and astrovirus. In addition, a quantitative TaqMan real time PCR for NoV was performed for quantification of viral DNA in order to compare the results with those obtained by conventional RT-PCR. NoV was detected in 33 out of 50 (66%) samples, and a 100% correlation between both methodologies was obtained. These results are demonstrating that NoV was the etiological agent responsible for those acute gastroenteritis cases. Partial nucleotide sequence analysis of the capsid gene revealed that the circulating strain was NoV GII/4 confirming the worldwide distribution of this genotype. The results highlight the role of NoV as a main viral agent responsible for gastroenteritis cases in children and adults both in outbreaks as well as in sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis."

Our study groups comprised women who presented in labour to the Goroka Base Hospital, their newborn infants, symptomatic children who presented to the hospital's Outpatients Department and men and women from 15 randomly selected villages in the Asaro Valley. In this analysis, the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) gene, omp1, of C. trachomatis was amplified using DNA obtained from the endocervix of women, urine from men, and both the eye and nasopharynx of children. Amplified DNAs were digested concurrently using Alul and a combination of EcoRI, Hinl and Hpall restriction enzymes. The mixtures were separated on electrophoretic gels and the respective serovars designated on the basis of resolved digested DNA patterns. Our results, which were confirmed also by omp1 sequence data, show serovars D, E, F, G, H and L3 to be present in the studied communities. The overall relative frequencies of these serovars were 30%, 21%, 25%, 1%, 20% and 2% respectively, with serovars D, E, F and H accounting for 97% of these infections. Double infections among these principal serovars were also detected in all our study groups but at a low overall frequency of 3%. Serovar D was the major agent involved in the aetiology of chlamydial infection in both children and adults though serovar F was the most frequent in newborn infants. Serovar H was relatively less frequent in symptomatic children. No trachoma-related serovars were detected, confirming the rarity of this disease in Papua New Guinea. In contrast, although clinical cases of lymphogranuloma venereum have not been described in the country, the detection of serovar L3 in this study suggests that it may occur. However, the association of L3 also with childhood infection indicates that it may be causing the same pathology as the serovars D-K that are associated with non-ulcerative sexually transmitted infections."
CD011926,0,18424204,0,Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of a de-novo t(2p;7p) translocation involving TNS3 and EXOC6B genes in a boy with a complex syndromic phenotype.,"We describe a premature newborn child with left renal agenesis, right low functional kidney, altered chemical-clinical parameters, neutropenia, recurrent pulmonary infections, long bone diaphysis broadening, growth and developmental delay. Postnatal cytogenetic analysis revealed a 46,XY,t(2;7)(p13;p12) de-novo karyotype. The chromosome breakpoints were defined by FISH using BAC probes and initially restricted to about 123,000bp in 2p13 and delimited to 84,600bp in 7p12. Bioinformatic analysis of these genomic regions showed two genes that are involved in the rearrangement: exocyst C6B (EXOC6B) for chromosome 2 breakpoint and tensin3 (TNS3) for chromosome 7 breakpoint. A EXOC6B-TNS3 fusion transcript together with a reciprocal TNS3-EXOC6B chimeric RNA have been detected by RT-PCR performed on skin fibroblasts RNA of the proband. These data localize the chromosome 2 breakpoint within the first intron of EXOC6B, while the translocation event on chromosome 7 occurred in intron 15 of TNS3. We hypothesize that the phenotype observed in the patient results from one or several mechanisms including: haploinsufficiency of EXOC6B and TNS3 genes; a dominant negative effect exerted by the chimeric transcripts; a disregulation in the expression of other genes adjacent the breakpoints. Although no clear evidences exist supporting a role of any of the above mentioned mechanisms in the pathogenesis of the complex phenotype, immunofluorescence analysis of tensin1 in the patient's fibroblasts suggests that the TNS3 gene haploinsufficiency results in a reduced expression of tensin1. These cells may be therefore a model for understanding the role and the organization of the tensin protein family."

Fecal specimens from 480 children <5 years of age who were admitted to a large children's hospital in the city of Valencia, Venezuela, with acute diarrhea during January to December 2003 were collected and screened by ELISA and RT-PCR for rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus, sapovirus, and astrovirus. Viral isolates were partially characterized by phylogenetic analysis. Norovirus viral load was determined by qRT-PCR. Viruses were identified in 205 (43%) of the 480 stool samples collected. Rotavirus was the virus detected most frequently (21%), followed by norovirus (13%), adenovirus (5%), sapovirus (3%), and astrovirus (2%). Viral infection rates were highest in the 6- to 11-month-old group (49%) and lowest in children >24 months old. Norovirus GII was more prevalent (90%) than GI (10%). Enteric adenovirus (serotypes 40/41) was present in 43% of the adenovirus-positive samples. Rotavirus infection caused more severe clinical symptoms than the other viruses detected, with more vomiting (84%) and dehydration (11%) that led to hospital admission of 20% of the children with acute gastroenteritis. Rotavirus and norovirus showed marked and opposite seasonal patterns. No association was observed between disease severity and viral load in children infected with norovirus. These results not only confirm the impact of rotavirus infection in Venezuela but also indicate that other enteric viruses, especially noroviruses, contribute significantly to sporadic acute gastroenteritis and to the burden of disease."

CD011926,0,15389835,0,N-acetylcysteine prevents endotoxin-induced degeneration of oligodendrocyte progenitors and hypomyelination in developing rat brain.,"Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), the dominant form of brain injury in premature infants, is characterized by diffuse white matter injury and is associated with cerebral palsy (CP). Maternal and placental infections are major causes of prematurity and identifiable etiology of PVL and CP. Here we have evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant and precursor of glutathione, to attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced white matter injury and hypomyelination in the developing rat brain, an animal model of PVL. Intraperitoneal pretreatment of pregnant female rats with NAC (50 mg/kg), 2 hr prior to administration of LPS at embryonic day 18 (E18), attenuated the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in fetal rat brains. There were significantly reduced numbers of TUNEL(+) nuclei coimmunostained for platelet-derived growth factor-alphaR(+) [a surface marker for oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs)] at E20 in the subventricular zone of fetal rat brain in the NAC + LPS group compared with the untreated LPS group. Interestingly, immunostaining for O4 and O1 as markers for late OPCs and immature oligodendrocytes demonstrated fewer O4(+) and O1(+) cells in the LPS group compared with the NAC + LPS and control groups. Consistent with O4(+)/O1(+) cell counts, the expression of myelin proteins such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and 2'3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, including transcription factors such as MyT1 and Gtx, was less in the LPS group at late postnatal days, indicating severe hypomyelination in the developing rat brain when compared with NAC + LPS and control groups. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that NAC may provide neuroprotection and attenuate the degeneration of OPCs against LPS evoked inflammatory response and white matter injury in developing rat brain. Moreover, these data suggest the possible use of NAC as a treatment for pregnant women with maternal or placental infection as a means of minimizing the risk of PVL and CP."

CD011926,0,22639173,0,Raman spectroscopic analysis of the clonal and horizontal spread of CTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a neonatal intensive care unit.,"Nosocomial outbreaks of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae are an increasing concern in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). We describe an outbreak of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae that lasted 5 months and affected 23 neonates in our NICU. Proton pump inhibitor and extended-spectrum cephalosporin exposure were significantly associated with the risk of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae colonisation and/or infection. Thirty isolates recovered from clinical, screening and environmental samples in the NICU were studied by means of Raman spectroscopy, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR). The Raman clustering was in good agreement with the results of the other two molecular methods. Fourteen isolates belonged to the Raman clone 1 and 16 to the Raman clone 3. Molecular analysis showed that all the strains expressed SHV-1 chromosomal resistance, plasmid-encoded TEM-1 and CTX-M-15 β-lactamases. Incompatibility groups of plasmid content identified by PCR-based replicon typing indicated that resistance dissemination was due to the clonal spread of K. pneumoniae and horizontal CTX-M-15 gene transfer between the two clones."
CD011926,0,24035383,0,Molecular detection of gastrointestinal viral infections in hospitalized patients.,"Gastrointestinal viral syndromes are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. Etiological agents include a large number of viruses encompassing several orders, families, and genera. During the period April 2011 to April 2012, 689 stool samples from as many patients hospitalized at the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo of Pavia exhibiting gastrointestinal syndromes were examined for the presence of rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, sapovirus, cosavirus, and aichi virus using polymerase chain reaction assays. Gastrointestinal viral agents were detected in 246 (36%) patients of the 689 analyzed. Adenovirus and norovirus were the most common viruses in this cohort, while aichi virus was the only gastrointestinal agent not detected. Surprisingly, rhinovirus was one of the most frequently detected viruses. However, a potential association with gastroenteritis remains to be confirmed."
CD011926,0,24035384,0,Interpretation of positive molecular tests of common viruses in the cerebrospinal fluid.,"Many central nervous system infections are historically difficult to diagnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has revolutionized the diagnosis of these infections because of their high sensitivity despite the lack of data on clinical usefulness. We conducted a retrospective study that included patients with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCR for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, JC virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) between January 2009 and December 2011. The positive results were grouped into definite, likely, and possible true positives and likely false-positive categories based on pre-specified definitions specific to each virus. Of 1663 CSF viral PCR tests, 88 were positive (5%). The combined positive predictive value (PPV) was 58%. The PPVs were least for CMV and EBV at 29 and 37%, respectively. A positive CSF viral PCR result has to be interpreted with caution due to several false-positive results."
CD011926,0,18367565,0,Comparison of serological and real-time PCR assays to diagnose Bordetella pertussis infection in 2007.,"Bacterial culture for diagnosing pertussis infection has high specificity but poor sensitivity and is slow. Highly sensitive real-time PCR assays and single-serum pertussis serology have been developed to overcome these limitations, but there are few data available on the relative sensitivities and specificities of such assays for pertussis diagnosis. Using data on 195 participants (>or=7 years old) from an epidemiological study, we assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and performance (Youden index) for pertussis diagnosis of the pertussis toxin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (using single and paired serology) and of real-time PCR assays (using the IS481 and ptxA-Pr targets). All available diagnostic information (clinical and laboratory) was pooled to serve as the gold standard. Single serology was the most efficient diagnostic test (Youden index, 0.57 to 0.58), with relatively high sensitivity (>64%) and high specificity (>90%), independent of the cutoff level. IS481 PCR performance was superior to that of ptxA-Pr PCR, and it was the second-most-efficient tool (Youden index, 0.30). Performing both ptxA-Pr and IS481 PCRs did not improve diagnostic performance. The greatest test efficiency (Youden index, 0.69 to 0.74) was achieved when single-serum serology was used in combination with IS481 or ptxA-Pr PCR or paired serology. Combining single serology with one PCR or paired serology increased the sensitivity with an associated limited decrease in specificity. The most specific tests for diagnosis of pertussis were single serology and ptxA-Pr PCR, and the most sensitive diagnostic tool was the combination of IS481 PCR with single serology."
CD011926,0,11361864,0,Early diagnosis of vertical HIV infection in infants by rapid detection of immune complex-dissociated HIV p24 antigen.,"Conventional HIV antibody detection was problematic for diagnosis of HIV infection in young infants < 18 months of age who were born to HIV-infected mothers. The HIV p24 antigen (Ag) is mainly bound to the antibody as an immune complex which causes underdetection by conventional methods. Attempts were made to dissociate these immune complexes to release free p24 Ag for detection. The current study's objective was to evaluate the rapid assays for detection of immune complex-dissociated p24 Ag (ICD p24 Ag) for early identification of HIV-infected infants as compared to the detection of HIV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The ICD was performed by acid dissociation and heat-denatured dissociation, and then the released ICD p24 Ag were detected. Tested were 41 HIV-infected children who acquired the infection perinatally and who had positive PCR and 30 HIV noninfected children with negative PCR. The overall sensitivity of the ICD p24 Ag detection after acid- and heat-denatured dissociation in the infected children was 85.4% and 87.8%, respectively, compared to 34.2% of p24 Ag without pretreatment for dissociation of the serum samples. The specificity of nonimmune complex dissociation and both methods of immune complex dissociation test were 100%. The sensitivity of ICD-p24 Ag test using these two methods showed excellent agreement (K = 0.893). Besides the relatively high sensitivity and specificity of the ICD p24 Ag test, its advantages include simplicity, rapidity, and relatively low cost--indicating ICD p24 Ag detection as a promising method for early diagnosis of vertical HIV infection in infants."

CD011926,0,19129410,0,Comparison of viral isolation and multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR for confirmation of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus detection by antigen immunoassays.,"We evaluated the Prodesse ProFlu-1 real-time reverse transcription-PCR multiplex assay with the SmartCycler instrument for the detection of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A and B viruses in comparison to conventional cell culture and antigen immunoassays with the BD Directigen A+B and Binax NOW RSV assays over two successive respiratory virus seasons. Ninety-two percent of the 361 specimens tested were nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from individual patients, of which 119 were positive for RSV and 59 were positive for influenza virus. The median age of the patients whose specimens were positive for RSV and influenza virus were 6.3 months and 42.4 years, respectively. The specificity of all of the methods tested was >or=99%, and the individual sensitivities of NOW RSV, RSV culture, Directigen A+B, influenza virus culture, and the Proflu-1 PCR for influenza/RSV were 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73 to 88), 57% (95% CI, 44 to 69), 59% (95% CI, 44 to 72), 54% (95% CI, 38 to 69), and 98% (95% CI, 93 to 100)/95% (95% CI, 85 to 99), respectively. In a clinical setting where viral isolation is performed to confirm rapid antigen immunoassay results for these common respiratory viruses, one-step real-time reverse transcriptase PCR testing can be a more sensitive and timely confirmatory method."
CD011926,0,24520412,0,Pediatric acute Q fever mimics other common childhood illnesses.,"Knowledge of Q fever has increased over the last decades, but research has mainly focused on adults. Data in children are scarce, and current knowledge is mostly based on case reports. The aim of this study was to determine predictors for acute Q fever in children in the general population. We retrospectively studied all children tested for Coxiella burnetii by serology and/or PCR upon request of their general practitioner in the regional laboratory for Medical Microbiology of the Jeroen Bosch during the Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2011. A total of 1061 patients was analyzed. Influenza-like illness and respiratory tract infection were the most common presentations of acute Q fever, mimicking other common childhood illnesses. None of the reported symptoms was significantly related to a positive test outcome and therefore presenting signs or symptoms have no predictive value in diagnosing Q-fever in children. Only diagnostic tests are reliable. As the infection generally follows a mild and uncomplicated course, we question if the difficulty of recognizing pediatric Q fever is a problem worth solving."

CD011926,0,7689096,0,"Hepatitis C virus infection in children with hemophilia: characterization of antibody response to four different antigens and relationship of antibody response, viremia, and hepatic dysfunction.","We studied hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in children with hemophilia by characterizing the antibody responses to four different HCV antigens and investigating the relationship of the antibody response to viremia and hepatic dysfunction. Three antigens (core, nonstructural (NS) 3, and NS5) were expressed in Escherichia coli transfected with plasmids that contained fragments of the putative core and of the NS3 and NS5 regions of the HCV genome, respectively. Antibody responses to these three antigens and the commercially available C100 antigen were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In 45 children with hemophilia, the percentage of children with seropositivity for C100, core, NS3, and NS5 protein in one or more specimens was 82%, 91%, 91%, and 89%, respectively. The time course of changes in the antibody response to the four antigens was determined by using sera obtained from 44 of the 45 patients at intervals of 1 to 4 years. Antibodies to the core and NS3 antigens appeared earlier and persisted longer than those to C100 and NS5 after HCV infection. The relationship of antibody response to viremia and hepatic dysfunction was investigated in 27 children by using the polymerase chain reaction assay. Five children whose tests results were negative for all four antigens did not have viremia or hepatic dysfunction; 13 of the 16 children with positive results for the four antigens had both viremia and hepatic dysfunction. Five of the six children whose serum had the core and NS3 antibodies but not either C100 or NS5, or both, had viremia, and three of them also had hepatic dysfunction. These results suggest that detection of antibodies to the core and NS3 antigens is useful for the serologic diagnosis of HCV infection and that both antibodies are more related to viremia than are the antibodies to C100 and NS5. In addition, viremia is strongly associated with hepatic dysfunction."

CD011926,0,21958085,0,Heterogeneity of disease and clones of community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in children attending a paediatric hospital in Belgium.,"The increase in the number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in children has prompted paediatricians to broaden th empirical treatment of common community-onset (CO) infections in children in several countries. Most European countries have reported low rates of CO-MRSA infection, but limited data on paediatric CO-MRSA infections are available. A prospective study was conducted from January 2002 to December 2004 in Brussels. CO-MRSA was defined as MRSA first detected by culture within 48 h of admission or in outpatients. Clinical and epidemiological data were recorded. CO-MRSA strains were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec, toxin (Panton-Valentin leukocidin (PVL), toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, and Eta/b), enterotoxin and antibiotic resistance genes were detected by PCR. The antibiotic resistance phenotype was determined by disk diffusion. S. aureus was isolated in 1681 children. Among these, 107 harboured MRSA. Fifty-one children were colonized or infected by CO-MRSA, 20% of whom had no healthcare exposure. Twelve infants <3 months old and five cystic fibrosis patients were colonized. None of the 22 infected patients (59% with acute otitis media and 36% with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs)) required hospitalization. Two-thirds of them failed to respond to empirical antibiotic therapy. The 37 characterized CO-MRSA strains were genetically diverse. Most of them had healthcare-associated genotypes. Only six strains were PVL-positive, all of which were ciprofloxacin-susceptible and more common in children with SSTIs (p 0.001). CO-MRSA remains uncommon in our paediatric population. So far, there is no need to modify the empirical treatment of common S. aureus infections. Monitoring of MRSA rates in S. aureus CO infections remains mandatory, and further investigation is warranted to establish the source of colonization in young infants."
CD011926,0,16372293,0,Accuracy of HCV-RNA PCR tests for diagnosis or exclusion of vertically acquired HCV infection.,"The aim of the study was to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values, and likelihood ratios for HCV-RNA PCR tests for the early diagnosis or exclusion of HCV infection in vertically exposed children. Data were included for children with confirmed HCV infection status from a European multi-center study. Confirmation was dependent on antibody status at or beyond 18 months, the 'gold standard' measure of infection status against which the use of qualitative HCV-RNA PCR tests was assessed. Of the 547 children included in this analysis, 193 were HCV-infected and 354 were not. Sensitivity of the HCV-RNA PCR test was low at birth (22%), but increased to 85% by 6 months. Specificity of RNA PCR was constant over age at 98%. The PPV of the PCR test rose from 33% at birth to 78% at 9 months of age, while NPV ranged from 96% to 99%. The high positive likelihood ratios from 1 month of age indicate strong evidence to diagnose infection but the negative likelihood ratios were consistent with weak evidence to exclude infection. The results suggest that the first qualitative HCV-RNA PCR test should be delayed until after the first month of life given the low sensitivity in the first few weeks. Although a negative test result after this time indicates probable absence of infection, this should be confirmed with a negative anti-HCV antibody test between 9 and 15 months of age as negative PCR results can be observed in infected children with fluctuations in viremia."

CD011926,0,8385871,0,Latent herpes simplex virus type 1 in human vestibular ganglia.,"Viral infection has been considered to be a possible pathogenesis of vestibular neuronitis, and reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is one of the most likely causes. However, it remains unknown whether the human vestibular ganglia contain latent HSV. We examined 26 vestibular ganglia from autopsied adults in search of HSV type 1 (HSV-1). To detect HSV-1, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining. HSV DNA was detected in 6 of 10 vestibular ganglia using the PCR method. However, the latency-associated transcript (LAT) of HSV-1 was negative in all of the 16 vestibular ganglia examined. No HSV antigen was detected in any of the ganglia. These results indicate that HSV-1 is latently infected in the human vestibular ganglia, and that LAT is transcribed weakly or not at all."

A total of 303 EDTA blood samples were collected from domestic dogs in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand, in May 2013. Microscopic observation of Giemsa-stained smears and molecular diagnosis using conventional PCR were performed. Infected dogs were treated with imidocarb dipropionate, a combination of imidocarb dipropionate and doxycycline, or doxycycline alone. Seventy-one (23.4%) out of 303 dogs were positive for DNA of tick-borne pathogens. Of the 303 animals, 13.2% and 1.3% were positive for a single infection with Babesia spp or Ehrlichia canis, respec- tively using microscopy; whereas 19.5% and 3.0% were positive using the PCR technique. Co-infection with Babesia spp and E. canis was observed in 0.7%, and coinfection with Hepatozoon canis and E. canis in 0.3%. Infected dogs were treated with the assigned drugs, and elimination of the pathogens was demonstrated by microscopy and PCR. The results indicated that while both microscopic and PCR diagnostic techniques were useful for tick-borne pathogen detection, PCR was more effective. Imidocarb dipropionate and doxycycline were found to be effective for treatment of babesiosis and ehrlichiosis, respectively. The present study suggests that the PCR technique has high sensitivity and specificity for Babesia and Ehrlichia diagnosis as well as for detection of Babesia spp, E. canis and H. canis DNA in EDTA blood specimens."
CD011926,0,20383779,0,Rapid typing of neonatal Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates using polymerase chain reaction for repeat regions in surface protein genes.,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a significant pathogen in neonatal sepsis and other nosocomial infections. For further investigations of the colonisation patterns and invasive pathways, typing methods that are applicable on large populations of bacterial isolates are warranted. In the present study, a genotyping method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the repeat regions of four genes (sdrG, sdrF, aap and sesE) that encode for bacterial surface proteins was developed and applied to a sample of well-characterised neonatal blood isolates of S. epidermidis (n = 49). The PCR products were visualised on agarose gel (sdrG, sdrF and sesE) or by fragment analysis (aap). The discriminatory index (D-index) for genotyping of the different genes was compared to genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The highest D-index for the PCR-based typing methods was found for the combination of sdrF, sdrG and aap (D-index 0.94), whereas the optimal two-gene combination (sdrF and aap) resulted in a D-index of 0.92. We conclude that the described method can be used for the genotyping of large populations of S. epidermidis isolates with a sufficient discriminatory capacity, and we suggest that the combination of sdrF and aap is the most suitable to use."

CD011926,0,21209161,0,Rapid stool-based diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection by real-time PCR in a children's hospital.,"Clostridium difficile is a major cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated infectious diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Detection of C. difficile by anaerobic bacterial culture and/or cytotoxicity assays has been largely replaced by rapid enzyme immunoassays (EIA). However, due to the lack of sensitivity of stool EIA, we developed a multiplex real-time PCR assay targeting the C. difficile toxin genes tcdA and tcdB. Stool samples from hospitalized pediatric patients suspected of having C. difficile-associated disease were prospectively cultured on cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar following alcohol shock. Six testing modalities were evaluated, including stool EIA, culture EIA, and real-time PCR (tcdA and tcdB) of cultured isolates and stool samples. Real-time PCR detection was performed with tcdA and tcdB gene-specific primers and hydrolysis probes using the LightCycler platforms (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). A total of 157 samples from 96 pediatric patients were analyzed. The sensitivities of stool real-time PCR and stool EIA were 95% and 35%, respectively, with a specificity of 100% for both methods. The lower limit of detection of the stool real-time PCR was 30 CFU/ml of stool sample per reaction for tcdA and tcdB. This study highlights the poor performance of stool toxin EIAs in pediatric settings. Direct detection of C. difficile toxin genes in stool samples by real-time PCR showed sensitivity superior to that of stool and culture EIAs and performance comparable to that of real-time PCR assay of cultured isolates. Real-time PCR of DNA from stool samples is a rapid and cost-effective diagnostic modality for children that should facilitate appropriate patient management and halt the practice of serial testing by EIA."

Very few studies have been performed in Iran using both cell culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to determine the prevalence of C. trachomatis as an etiological agent of ophthalmia neonatorum. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis (NCC) as diagnosed by both methods in two hospitals in Tehran, Iran. From March 2008 to May 2009, out of 2253 neonates, 241 (10.7%) with clinical findings of conjunctivitis were included in this study. A total of 241 conjunctival swabs were tested by cell culture (as the gold standard test), PCR, and Giemsa staining. Cell cultures were positive for C. trachomatis in 31 (12.9%) neonates, C. trachomatis was positive in 40 (16.6%) neonates by PCR and 18 (7.5%) by Giemsa staining. The sensitivity of PCR was 100%, whereas Giemsa staining sensitivity was 558.1%. High sensitivity (100%) and specificity (95.7%) of PCR as compared to culture makes it a proper diagnostic method for the detection of C. trachomatis."

CD011926,0,17245723,0,Rotavirus immunoglobulin levels among Indian mothers of two socio-economic groups and occurrence of rotavirus infections among their infants up to six months.,"Rotavirus specific immunoglobulin levels were estimated and compared between mothers undergoing delivery from two socio-economic groups (n = 56 each) by direct/capture ELISA. IgG geometric mean titers (GMTs) of cord blood/mothers serum at delivery were significantly higher in the higher socio-economic group (HSG) as compared to the lower socio-economic group (LSG) (P < 0.01). Thirty-four mother-infant pairs (17 from each group) were followed-up up to 6 months for the occurrence of rotavirus infections. All follow-up LSG infants were low birth weight as against none from the HSG. Detection of virus by ELISA/RT-PCR and considering IgM/IgA seroconversion as an index of infection, 11 and 17 infants from HSG and LSG respectively had rotavirus infections. Two infants from LSG were hospitalized for severe rotavirus diarrhea but none from the HSG. Lower IgG levels in the LSG mother-infant pairs as compared to those of HSG, suggests a possible role of under nutrition in development of antibodies and immunity. Infants from the HSG who did not have rotavirus infections had significantly higher IgG GMTs in cord blood and serum samples at 6 months, than those HSG infants who had symptomatic/asymptomatic rotavirus infections (P < 0.05). In conclusion, fewer rotavirus infections occur when cord blood contains higher level of IgG antibodies, suggesting a role of protective immunity."

In this study, 35 serovar Infantis strains, isolated from children admitted to four different Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, hospitals between 1996 and 2001, were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing in order to determine their genetic relatedness and antimicrobial resistance profiles. Thirty-four serovar Infantis strains were resistant to at least two antibiotic classes, and all 35 strains were susceptible to fluoroquinolones, cephamycin, and carbapenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) screening by double-disk diffusion indicated that 32 serovar Infantis strains (91.4%) produced beta-lactamases that were inhibited by clavulanic acid. Antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were determined by PCR for a subset of 11 multidrug-resistant serovar Infantis strains, and putative ESBLs were detected by isoelectric focusing. Ten serovar Infantis strains carried bla(TEM), catI, ant(3"")Ia and/or ant(3"")Ib, sulI and/or sulII, and tet(D) genes as well as an integron-associated aac(6')-Iq cassette. Eight strains possessed at least four different beta-lactamases with pI profiles that confirmed the presence of both ESBLs and non-ESBLs.

Histologically, infants in both groups showed characteristic inclusion-bearing cells most commonly in lung, kidney, liver and pancreas. IHC for late proteins using a rabbit polyclonal antibody and ISH for viral genomes detected most of the infected cells as nuclear and/or cytoplasmic signals. However, immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody against viral immediate early (IE) proteins was variable depending on the stage of viral replication within an individual infected cell. In tissues of infants with postnatal HCMV infection, many cells harboured IE antigens, while in tissues from congenital cases most of the affected cells lacked IE antigens and only a few showed cytoplasmic staining. The difference was not caused by the antigenic diversity among viral strains as confirmed by in vitro study. Our findings suggested that congenital infections exhibited uniformly late stage proteins with inactive viral replication at death, while acquired ones remained active. The different viral activity may reflect the immune status of congenital and acquired HCMV infections."
CD011926,0,26289365,0,Heated birthing pools as a source of Legionnaires' disease.,"In June 2014 Public Health England confirmed a case of Legionnaires' disease (LD) in a neonate following birth at home in a hired birthing pool incorporating a heater and a recirculation pump which had been filled in advance of labour. The case triggered a public health investigation and a microbiological survey of an additional ten heated birthing pools hired or recently hired to the general public across England. The birthing pool used by the parent of the confirmed case was identified as the source of the neonate's infection following detection of Legionella pneumophila ST48 in both patient and environmental samples. Legionella species were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction but not culture in a further three pools together with other opportunistic pathogens identified by culture and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry. A Patient Safety Alert from NHS England and Public Health England was issued stating that heated birthing pools filled in advance of labour should not be used for home births. This recommendation remains in place. This investigation in conjunction with other recent reports has highlighted a lack of awareness regarding the microbiological safety of heated birthing pools and their potential to be a source of LD and other opportunistic infections. Furthermore, the investigation raised important considerations with regards to microbiological sampling and testing in such incidents. Public health authorities and clinicians should consider LD in the differential diagnosis of severe respiratory infection in neonates within 14 days of a water birth."

Thus, its detection seems to be useful, especially in the case of E. coli strains isolated from pregnant women and newborns. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the latex agglutination test (Pastorex Meningitis) for identification of E. coli serogroup K1 were assessed, using PCR as the gold standard. Our results showed that consistency of results between latex agglutination test and PCR amounted to 98.5%. Therefore, Pastorex Meningitis is a good alternative to PCR and could be used for rapid K1 antigen detection, especially in local non-specialized laboratories with limited resources where PCR assay is not applied."

The aim of this study was to summarize the data from the Brazilian surveillance system of influenza and other respiratory viruses and discuss the patterns of viral circulation. The system is based on detecting cases of influenza-like illness in sentinel sites and weekly collection of five nasopharyngeal secretions samples, which are processed in state public health laboratories for respiratory viruses by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Data from 2000 to 2010 were described over time, by region, gender, and age group, and an analysis of Spearman correlation was performed between monthly influenza detection and rainfall and temperature data in two state capitals with the highest number of positive samples, one from the northeast region (Maceió) and other from the southern region (Curitiba). There were 3,291,946 visits for influenza-like illness; of these, 37,120 had samples collected and 6421 tested positive: 1690 (26%) influenza A, 567 (9%) influenza B, 277 (4%) parainfluenza 1, 571 (9%) parainfluenza 2, 589 (9%) parainfluenza 3, 742 (12%) adenovirus, and 1985 (31%) respiratory syncytial virus. Overall, increased activity of respiratory syncytial virus was observed from March to June, preceding the peak of influenza activity, from May to August, but with regional differences. In Maceió, there was a weak correlation between temperature and influenza detection (ρ=0.05), but a moderate positive correlation between rainfall and influenza detection (ρ=0.36). In Curitiba, a high correlation was observed between the decrease in temperature and rainfall and the increase in influenza detection (ρ=-0.83 and -0.78 respectively). These data are important to guide public health control measures as the best time for influenza vaccination and use of antivirals."

The first PCA case, in December 2007, developed multi-organ failure leading to death within a short time frame: the other two cases survived after treatment with intravenous antifungal therapy followed by oral posaconazole. Air, surface, and water samples were collected within the NICU and from the incubators that were occupied by the neonates. All recovered fungal isolates were confirmed as A. fumigatus by sequencing the beta-tubulin region. Microsatellite strain typing demonstrated genotypically related A. fumigatus isolates from the neonates and the humidity chambers (HCs) of the neonates' incubators, suggesting that the source of the infection may have been the HCs/incubators used in the NICU. Aspergillus strain typing may be a useful tool in clinical outbreak settings to help understand the source of exposure and to design targeted environmental interventions to prevent future infections."

We amplified 1.2 kbp DNA fragments of ompA gene from 15 reference strains of C. trachomatis by two-step PCR using two pairs of primers. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using a combination of three endonucleases (HinfI, HindIII and HhaI) completely differentiated 13 of the 15 serovars; the exceptions were B and Ba. We then used this method for 18 strains of C. trachomatis isolated from Japanese patients with inclusion conjunctivitis, serotyping them into six groups: D (5/18), G (5/18), E (3/18), H (2/18), F (1/18), and K (1/18). In our comparison of cell culture isolation with PCR analysis of 38 conjunctival swabs from 35 patients in Sapporo with follicular conjunctivitis, 8 were positive in culture isolation and were also positive in two-step PCR. Twenty-five of 26 strains (the 18 isolated strains and 8 strains amplified by two-step PCR) were genotyped to D, G, H, E, F, and K. One isolated strain could not be identified. The C. trachomatis which causes inclusion conjunctivitis in Japan appears to have a distribution of serovars similar to that of the sexually transmitted diseases."
CD011926,0,15184454,0,"Comparison of blood smear, antigen detection, and nested-PCR methods for screening refugees from regions where malaria is endemic after a malaria outbreak in Quebec, Canada.","The importation of malaria into a region where it is not endemic raises many concerns, including the timely delivery of appropriate care, safety of the blood supply, and the risk of autochthonous transmission. There is presently no consensus on the best way to screen mobile populations for malaria. Between August 2000 and March 2001, 535 refugees arrived in Quebec, Canada, from Tanzanian camps. Within 4 weeks of resettlement of the first group of 224, the McGill University Centre for Tropical Diseases noted an outbreak of malaria across the province (15 cases over a 3-week period). This group (group 1) was traced and screened for malaria between 3 and 4 months after arrival in Canada. Subsequent groups of 106 and 205 refugees were screened immediately upon arrival in Canada (group 2) and immediately prior to their departure from refugee camps (group 3), respectively. A single EDTA-blood sample was obtained from 521 refugees for testing by thick and thin blood smears (groups 1 and 2), antigen detection (ICT Malaria Pf and OptiMAL; group 1 only), and nested PCR (all groups). Overall, 98 of 521 refugees were found to be infected (18.8%). The vast majority of infections (81 of 98) were caused by Plasmodium falciparum alone. Using PCR as the ""gold standard,"" both microscopy (sensitivity, 50%; specificity, 100%) and antigen detection (ICT sensitivity, 37.5%; ICT specificity, 100%; OptiMAL sensitivity, 29.1%; OptiMAL specificity, 95.6%) performed poorly. None of the PCR-positive subjects were symptomatic at the time of testing, and only two had recently had symptoms compatible with malaria (with or without diagnosis and treatment). Active surveillance of migrants from regions of intense malaria transmission can reduce the risk of morbidity in the migrant population and mitigate against transmission to the host population. Our data demonstrate that PCR is, by far, the most powerful tool for such surveillance."
CD011926,0,21257741,0,Detection of low-level K65R variants in nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-naive chronic and acute HIV-1 subtype C infections.,"To substantiate reports of greater emergence of the K65R nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C, we examined natural low-level K65R expression in subtype C relative to subtypes B and AE. We used allele-specific polymerase chain reaction to screen HIV-1 amplified by reverse-transcription high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction from subtype C-infected South African women and infants and CRF01(subtype AE) from Thailand; all subjects were NRTI naive. We found low-level K65R of unknown clinical significance in NRTI-naive subtype C-infected women and infants at frequencies above the natural occurrence in subtypes B and AE. The frequent appearance of subtype C frameshift deletions at codon 65 supports a propensity for transcription error in this region."

To this purpose, Guthrie cards were collected from 18 infants born to mothers with primary Toxoplasma gondii infection during pregnancy. Moreover, the analytical sensitivity of T. gondii PCR was assessed by testing mock dried blood specimens set up with several known DNA dilutions. IgM WB was demonstrated to be the most sensitive method. When the results of T. gondii DNA detection and specific IgM recovery were combined, retrospective CT diagnosis by using Guthrie cards was established in 3 out of 6 infected infants (sensitivity, 50%; 95% confidence interval, 26.8% to 73.2%). No positive PCR or serologic results were found in the group of 12 uninfected infants, demonstrating the excellent specificity of the three methods (95% confidence interval, 78.1% to 99.5%). The findings of the present study suggest that, in cases of missed diagnosis of CT at birth, analysis of Guthrie cards for children with compatible clinical findings after the perinatal period, in particular the combination of recovery of specific IgM antibodies and T. gondii DNA amplification, could be helpful. Nevertheless, since suboptimal conditions of storage of dried blood specimens can seriously affect sensitivity, negative results cannot rule out CT diagnosis. In contrast, because of the excellent specificity shown by IgM serologic testing and T. gondii DNA amplification on Guthrie cards, positive results obtained by either of the two methods should be considered diagnostic."

CD011926,0,20453122,0,Fluorescence in situ hybridization method using a peptide nucleic acid probe for identification of Salmonella spp. in a broad spectrum of samples.,"A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method for the rapid detection of Salmonella spp. using a novel peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe was developed. The probe theoretical specificity and sensitivity were both 100%. The PNA-FISH method was optimized, and laboratory testing on representative strains from the Salmonella genus subspecies and several related bacterial species confirmed the predicted theoretical values of specificity and sensitivity. The PNA-FISH method has been successfully adapted to detect cells in suspension and is hence able to be employed for the detection of this bacterium in blood, feces, water, and powdered infant formula (PIF). The blood and PIF samples were artificially contaminated with decreasing pathogen concentrations. After the use of an enrichment step, the PNA-FISH method was able to detect 1 CFU per 10 ml of blood (5 x 10(9) +/- 5 x 10(8) CFU/ml after an overnight enrichment step) and also 1 CFU per 10 g of PIF (2 x 10(7) +/- 5 x 10(6) CFU/ml after an 8-h enrichment step). The feces and water samples were also enriched according to the corresponding International Organization for Standardization methods, and results showed that the PNA-FISH method was able to detect Salmonella immediately after the first enrichment step was conducted. Moreover, the probe was able to discriminate the bacterium in a mixed microbial population in feces and water by counter-staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). This new method is applicable to a broad spectrum of samples and takes less than 20 h to obtain a diagnosis, except for PIF samples, where the analysis takes less than 12 h. This procedure may be used for food processing and municipal water control and also in clinical settings, representing an improved alternative to culture-based techniques and to the existing Salmonella PNA probe, Sal23S10, which presents a lower specificity."

CD011926,0,11255097,0,Congenital HCMV infection: a collaborative and comparative study of virus detection in amniotic fluid by culture and by PCR.,"Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is the leading cause of congenital virus infection in developed countries, affecting an estimated 1% of births. This antenatal infection can cause serious sequelae. Strategies for prevention and treatment must, therefore, be agreed upon, entailing a preliminary performance assessment of antenatal virus diagnosis techniques. Between 1992 and 1999, HCMV serology status was established for 19456 pregnant women in four French hospitals. Seronegative patients (55.4%) were given serology screening, and antenatal diagnosis was given to 152 women who had shown seroconversion during their pregnancies (1.4%). The detection of HCMV transmission from mother to fetus was finally established in 95 cases, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture methods for detecting HCMV in the amniotic fluid. These results were compared with viral culture of children's urine after birth, enabling us to distinguish between children really infected in utero (30%) and non-infected children (70%). The results of the virus culture and those of PCR were identical in 94 of the 95 cases, with one discrepancy (culture-/PCR+). The two diagnosis techniques had identical sensitivity (72%), with culture proving slightly more specific than PCR (98.4% as opposed to 96.9%). Positive prediction values for culture and for PCR were, respectively, 95.6 and 91.3%. Antenatal virus diagnosis on amniotic fluid was negative with both techniques in 8 out of 29 cases of children born with HCMV infection (VPN=89%). Over half of these wrongly negative results can be explained by amniocentesis carried out too early in the pregnancy or too early with respect to the mother's primary infection."

CD011926,0,10785332,0,Epidemiology of HIV infection in the newborn.,"Vertical transmission of HIV infection can take place in utero, during delivery and postnatally through breastfeeding, with about three-quarters of infections occurring around the time of delivery in non-breastfeeding populations. In Europe, in the absence of specific interventions, the vertical transmission rate was 15-20%. High maternal load is the major risk factor for both intra-uterine and intra-partum mother-to-child transmission. Prematurity is the most common adverse neonatal outcome associated with maternal HIV infection. Earlier diagnosis of paediatric HIV infection than previously available is now possible with virological tests, particularly HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction. An estimated one fifth of infected children will have been diagnosed with AIDS or have died by 12 months of age, rising to a third by 6 years of age. Surgical and therapeutic interventions are effective in reducing vertical transmission risk, in addition to the avoidance of breastfeeding. Caesarean section delivery before labour and before rupture of membranes approximately halves the risk of transmission, while prophylactic zidovudine therapy according to the ACTG076 regimen reduces transmission by up to two-thirds, transmission is reduced even further with both interventions. Trials of short-course zidovudine regimens show their effectiveness in reducing vertical transmission, in breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding populations. Nevirapine has been shown to be significantly more effective than short course zidovudine regimens in breastfeeding populations, but is still under evaluation in non-breastfeeding populations additionally receiving routine anti-retroviral prophylaxis. Reports of a small number of serious adverse events in uninfected children exposed in utero or neonatally to antiretroviral therapy need further investigation. Trials of vitamin A supplementation to reduce vertical transmission have had negative results, while the effectiveness of vaginal lavage and passive immune therapy in reducing vertical transmission remains uncertain."

CD011926,0,11981525,0,Integration of statistical theory and practical clinical expertise. Polymerase chain reaction testing of the HIV-exposed infant.,"Testing of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed infant has improved markedly over the past decade. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has made accurate diagnosis possible by 4 months of age and improved sensitivity and specificity of PCR testing has obviated the need for serologic follow-up for most HIV-exposed infants. Clinicians may use PCR testing and simple statistical theory to develop a rational algorithm for diagnosis of HIV-exposed infants. Physicians should determine whether the infant is at low, moderate, or high risk for acquiring HIV. After risk-stratification the physician may proceed with 2 PCR tests, 3 PCR tests, or PCR testing and serologic follow-up. Infants of mothers who are on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at delivery, whose mothers have a low or undetectable viral load at delivery, and who do not breast-feed, should be considered low-risk. These low-risk infants should have 2 PCR tests, 1- and 4-months post partum. Infants whose mothers have an unknown or high viral load at delivery and who do not breast-feed should be considered moderate-risk. These infants should have 3 negative PCR tests, 1 during the first month of life, 1 after the first month of life, and 1 after 4 months of life. Infants who breast-feed should be considered high-risk and require at least 3 negative PCR tests, PCR testing every 3 months until breast-feeding stops, and serologic follow-up. Any positive PCR test requires virologic confirmation and serologic follow-up."
CD011926,0,16284530,0,Effectiveness of short-term and long-term zidovudine prophylaxis on detection of HIV-1 subtype E in human placenta and vertical transmission.,"Antiretroviral treatment with zidovudine (ZDV) from the 14th week until the end of pregnancy has markedly reduced the vertical transmission rate of HIV-1 in Europe and North America. A shorter duration of treatment has reduced this rate in Africa and Southeast Asia to a lesser degree. In Southeast Asia, subtype E is the major subtype rather than subtype B as in Western countries. The goals of this study were to determine the optimal duration of ZDV prophylaxis for subtype E and to confirm its effectiveness at the histologic level. Fifty pregnant women seropositive for HIV-1 subtype E were given ZDV prophylaxis consisting of 300 mg administered twice daily, switching to 300 mg administered every 3 hours from the onset of labor until delivery. Twenty-seven received ""short-term"" ZDV lasting 14 to 35 days before delivery, whereas the other 23 received ""long-term"" ZDV lasting 62 to 92 days. The effectiveness of ZDV prophylaxis was assessed by detection of HIV-1 in the placenta using in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All babies in this study were tested up to one year of age. Three were not positive until after one month of age, but one was positive as a neonate. Four neonates were positive for HIV-1 as detected by PCR on peripheral blood, including one in the neonatal period. All cases were from the short-term prophylaxis group. Decidual glandular epithelial cells were the only cell type in the placenta that expressed HIV proviral DNA under ZDV prophylaxis. Sixty-seven percent of placentas in the short-term ZDV group showed more than occasional positive cells compared with 22% in the group receiving long-term ZDV prophylaxis (P < 0.02). This is first study to compare the effectiveness of short-term and long-term ZDV prophylaxis with respect to the presence of HIV in the placenta. Our study shows that longer (at least 60 days) prophylaxis is more effective in reducing HIV expression in the placenta and is associated with reduced transmission to neonates."

CD011926,0,17483271,0,Characterization of the zinc-containing metalloprotease encoded by zpx and development of a species-specific detection method for Enterobacter sakazakii.,"Enterobacter sakazakii causes a severe form of neonatal meningitis that occurs as sporadic cases as well as outbreaks. The disease has been epidemiologically associated with consumption of reconstituted, dried infant formulas. Very little information is available regarding pathogenicity of the organism and production of virulence factors. Clinical and environmental strains were screened for production of factors which have activity against Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in tissue culture. Polymyxin B lysate and sonicate preparations but not culture supernatants from the strains caused ""rounding"" of CHO cells. Subsequent studies showed that the CHO cell-rounding factor is a proteolytic enzyme that has activity against azocasein. The cell-bound protease was isolated by using a combination of polymyxin B lysis, followed by sonication of cells harvested from tryptone broth. The protease was purified to homogeneity by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography with Sephadex G-100, hydrophobic interaction chromatography with phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and a second gel filtration with Sephadex G-100. In addition to activity against azocasein, the purified protease also exhibits activity against azocoll and insoluble casein but not elastin. The protease has a molecular weight of 38,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.4. It is heat labile and for maximal activity against azocasein has an optimum temperature of 37 degrees C and a pH range of 5 to 7. Proteolytic activity is inhibited by ortho-phenanthroline and Zincov but is not affected by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide, and trypsin inhibitors, which demonstrates that the protease is a zinc-containing metalloprotease. The metalloprotease does not hemagglutinate chicken or sheep erythrocytes. Twenty-three to 27 of the first 42 N-terminal amino acid residues of the metalloprotease are identical to proteases produced by Serratia proteamaculans, Pectobacterium carotovorum, and Anabaena sp. PCR analysis using primers designed from a consensus nucleotide sequence showed that 135 E. sakazakii strains possessed the metalloprotease gene, zpx, and 25 non-E. sakazakii strains did not. The cloned zpx gene of strain 29544 consists of 1,026 nucleotides, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the metalloprotease has 341 amino acid residues, which corresponds to a theoretical protein size of 37,782 with a theoretical pI of 5.23. The sequence possesses three well-characterized zinc-binding and active-site motifs present in other bacterial zinc metalloproteases."

CD011926,0,12794551,0,Long-term mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-uninfected infants born to HIV-infected mothers.,"Although children born to HIV-infected (HIV+) women receiving antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy show virtually no adverse clinical effects at birth, the antiretroviral nucleoside analog drugs are known to damage nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. In this study, biomarkers of mitochondrial toxicity and genotoxicity have been examined in a well-characterized sample set consisting of infants born to HIV-uninfected (HIV-) mothers (n = 30), and HIV- infants (n = 20) born to HIV-infected (HIV+) mothers who received either no antiretroviral therapy (n = 10) or zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine [AZT]) during pregnancy (n = 10). DNA from cord blood leukocytes and peripheral blood leukocytes taken at 1 and 2 years of age was examined for loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and telomere integrity. Telomere length, a measure of nuclear DNA damage, was the same in all infants at birth and at age 1 year. The quantity of mtDNA was assessed relative to nuclear DNA using a polymerase chain reaction-based chemiluminescence detection (PCR-CID) method that determined mitochondrial D Loop gene copies relative to nuclear 18S RNA gene copies by comparison with a standard curve. MtDNA quantity was expressed as a ratio of gene copy numbers. In infants of uninfected mothers (AZT-/HIV-) at the three time points, the ratios were 442 to 515, whereas in infants of untreated AZT-/HIV+ mothers the ratios were 261 to 297, and in infants of AZT-treated (AZT+/HIV+) mothers the ratios were 146 to 203. At all three time points, differences between the AZT-/HIV- group and the two HIV+ groups were statistically significant (p <.05), and differences between the AZT-/HIV+ and AZT+/HIV+ groups were also statistically significant (p <.05), demonstrating that AZT exposure causes a persistent depletion of mtDNA. The study shows that children of HIV+ mothers are at risk for mitochondrial damage that is further increased in infants of mothers receiving AZT during pregnancy."

This presentation aims to focus on and update epidemiological data, research methods, involved factors, control strategy and possible prevention of congenital infection with T. cruzi. Considering that etiological treatment of the child is always effective if performed before one year of age, the diagnosis of infection in pregnant women and their newborns has to become the standard of care and integrated into the surveillance programs of syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus. In addition to the standard tests, polymerase chain reaction performed on blood of neonates of infected mothers one month after birth might improve the diagnosis of congenital infection. Recent data bring out that its transmission can be prevented through treatment of infected women before they become pregnant. The role of parasite genotypes and host genetic factors in parasite transmission and development of infection in foetuses/neonates has to be more investigated in order to better estimate the risk factors and impact on health of congenital infection with T. cruzi."

We analyzed the prevalence of EBV in saliva and throat washings from healthy people in Japan by the polymerase chain reaction assay. EBV DNA was detected in 43 (90%) of the 48 throat washings from healthy adults (21 to 57 years old) and in 35 (38%) of the 93 salivas from healthy children (0 to 6 years old). The percentages of the EBV DNA-positive ratio in salivas increased in proportion relative to the increase of the children's ages. EBV type 1 was predominant and was detected in 86 and 94% of adults and children, respectively. Umbilical cord lymphocytes were transformed by some throat washings from EBV seropositive donors. EBV DNA was detected in throat washings from two healthy adults whose EBV antibody was not detected. In both cases, higher amounts of EBV DNA were detected in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells than in those of other, EBV antibody-positive donors. These results demonstrated the incidence of EBV excretion in oral regions of healthy individuals in Japan and defined a novel type of EBV infection in healthy adults."

EV-D68 has also been reported from European countries, but no data from Sweden are available. This study investigated respiratory specimens collected during July-October 2014 from 30 Swedish children aged 0-9 years who were positive for enterovirus and/or rhinovirus in routine clinical PCR. Seven samples were typed as EV-D68 by VP4/VP2 sequencing. Two genetically distinct EV-D68 variants coexisted. Six viruses belonged to clade B, the variant involved in the North American outbreak, and one virus belonged to clade A. Respiratory illness was the major symptom among EV-D68 infected patients and all fully recovered. This is the first report of EV-D68 in Sweden.

The disease is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections and profound hypogammaglobulinemia with marked reduction or lack of mature B-cells in the peripheral blood. Molecular characterization of BTK gene provides an opportunity for definitive diagnosis of XLA patients, especially for those with atypical phenotype resulting in a milder or late-onset form of the disease. The diagnosis allows accurate carrier detection with subsequent genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. In this study, long polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing analysis of the BTK gene in 12 unrelated Chinese XLA patients had been performed. Eight recurrent mutations and four novel mutations were identified. This is the first report of Chinese cases from three different East Asia regions together, including Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland China.

We retrospectively reviewed the results for 282 amniotic fluid samples that had been tested for CMV by a quantitative real-time PCR. We observed three cases in which no CMV genomes were detected in the AF but in which the children were nevertheless congenitally infected. Hence, we conclude that a negative result by PCR for CMV in AF cannot rule out the possibility of congenital infection. No false-positive PCR results were observed. A correlation between the CMV viral load in AF and the fetal and neonatal outcomes could not be demonstrated in our study. Instead, a correlation was found between the CMV viral load and the gestational age at the time of amniocentesis."

Each sample was tested for rotavirus, and astrovirus by ELISA, G and P type was determined for all rotaviruses. Adenoviruses were sought by hexon-specific PCR and identified by RFLP. A subset of 253 samples was also tested for norovirus by ELISA. Data were analyzed for seasonality of infection, patient nationality and likelihood of hospitalization. Although the overall incidence of rotavirus identification in acute diarrheal stool continued to decline, this was still the virus identified most commonly (6%). Norovirus accounted for 3.5%, astrovirus, 1.9% and adenovirus, 1.4%. Type G9 rotavirus was found to be present (and already common) in 2003, predating its first reported identification in the country in 2004. Most of the virus infections (and most of the G9 detections) occurred in April, the month following the occurrence of the Hajj in the study year. Although most viruses were spread equally in the population, rotaviruses were significantly more common in non-Saudis than in Saudi citizens.

Between this age and 15 years of age, the efficacy decreases to around 60%. Therefore, early infection detection is a priority in vertical transmission. The aim of this work was to assess whether polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plays a predictive role in the diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease as compared to conventional parasitological and serological methods. To this end, we studied a total of 468 children born to Trypanosoma cruzi seroreactive mothers came from Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay, who lived in the city of Buenos Aires and suburban areas (Argentina), a non-endemic area of this country. These children were assessed by PCR from 2004 to 2009 with the specific primers Tcz1 and Tcz2, and 121 and 122. PCR allowed detecting 49 T. cruzi-positive children. Eight of these 49 children were excluded from the analysis: six because they did not complete follow-up and two because the first control was performed after 12 months of age. Parasitological methods allowed detecting 25 positive children, 7 of whom had been earlier diagnosed by PCR (1.53±2.00 vs. 6.71±1.46 months; p=0.0002). Serological methods allowed detecting 16 positive children, 12 of whom had been earlier diagnosed by PCR (1.46±1.48 vs. 11.77±4.40 months; p<0.0001). None of the children negative by PCR was positive by serological or parasitological methods. This study shows that PCR allows early diagnosis in congenital Chagas disease. At present, an early positive PCR is not indicative for treatment. However, a positive PCR would alert the health system to search only those infected infants diagnosed by early PCR and thus generate greater efficiency in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital T. cruzi infection."

New genes defects causing immunodeficiency include phophoglucomutase 3 (PGM3), cytidine 5' triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS1), nuclear factor κB-inducing kinase (NIK), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), phosphoinositide-3 kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), IL21, and Jagunal homolog 1 (JAGN1). New case reports expanded the clinical spectrum of gene defects. For example, a specific recombination-activating gene 1 variant protein with partial recombinant activity might produce Omenn syndrome or a common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. Central and peripheral B-cell tolerance was investigated in patients with several primary immunodeficiencies, including common variable immunodeficiency and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, to explain the occurrence of autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders. The role of IL-12 and IL-15 in the enhancement of natural killer cell activity was reported. Newborn screening for T-cell deficiency is being implemented in more states and is achieving its goal of defining the true incidence of severe combined immunodeficiency and providing early treatment that offers the highest survival for these patients. Definitive treatment of severe immunodeficiency with both hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy was reported to be successful, with increasing definition of conditions needed for optimal outcomes. Progress in HIV infection is directed toward the development of an effective vaccine and the eradication of hidden latent virus reservoirs."

In Colombia, with higher frequency of Plasmodium vivax over Plasmodium falciparum infection, recent reports confirmed gestational malaria as a serious public health problem. Thick smear examination is the gold standard to diagnose malaria in endemic settings, but in recent years, molecular diagnostic methods have contributed to elucidate the dimension of the problem of gestational malaria. The study was aimed at exploring the prevalence of gestational, placental and congenital malaria in women who delivered at the local hospitals of north-west Colombia, between June 2008 and April 2011."

CD011926,0,24974272,0,Serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of USA Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected prior to and post introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.,"This study evaluated pneumococci cultured from blood or lower respiratory tract specimens from hospitalized patients in the USA (all age groups) during 2011-2012 (N = 1190) and compared findings with those from a similar study performed in 2008 (N = 694). Isolates were tested for susceptibility by broth microdilution and serotypes determined by cpsB sequencing, supplemented with multiplex PCR and capsular swelling assays. Relative percentages of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) types were 6.3 and 4.9% in 2008 and 2011-2012, respectively, and the most common PCV7 serotypes (19F and 6B) comprised only 3.7% and 4.0% of all isolates from both periods, respectively. Thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotypes represented 42.9% of isolates in 2008 and 30.1% in the second period, and this decrease was driven by 19A and 7F. Non-PCV13 serogroups/serotypes 23A, 15B/15C, 7C, 8, and 31 increased. Penicillin non-susceptibility rates were 9.6-10.0% and 38.9-42.7% when applying the parenteral (i.e. ≥ 4 μg/mL) and oral breakpoints (i.e. ≥ 0.12 μg/mL), respectively. Ceftaroline was the most potent agent tested based on MIC50 and MIC90 values (≤ 0.015 and 0.12 μg/mL, respectively) for both time periods."

CD011926,0,2550582,0,Enhanced endothelial cytopathogenicity induced by a cytomegalovirus strain propagated in endothelial cells.,"Endothelial involvement has been implicated in cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, a source of major complications in immunosuppressed individuals (e.g., those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS] and organ transplants). Traditionally, CMV has been grown in fibroblasts; however, propagation in these cells may alter characteristics of the virus. In developing an in vitro model system of CMV/endothelial cell interaction, we have addressed this issue by propagating a clinical isolate, CMV VHL 1, in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells by serial cocultivation of heavily infected cultures with fresh HUVE monolayers and have compared its infectious properties with those of the fibroblast-raised strain, CMV AD169. In situ hybridization using a biotinylated DNA probe, as well as immunofluorescent staining for CMV-specific antigen, has confirmed infection of HUVE cells inoculated with either strain of the virus. Infection of HUVE by VHL was accompanied by dramatic cytopathology not observed in AD169-infected cells. Plaque assay of culture supernatants revealed greater virus production in VHL-infected HUVE as compared with equivalently inoculated fibroblasts. In contrast, AD169 production in inoculated fibroblasts exceeded that in HUVE. These studies demonstrate the suitability of cultured endothelial cells as a substrate for CMV propagation and suggest that a strain of virus thus propagated may offer an accurate model of CMV/endothelial cell interaction in human disease."
CD011926,0,17050583,0,Comparison of an rRNA-based and DNA-based nucleic acid amplification test for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in trachoma.,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) hopes to achieve global elimination of trachoma, still the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, in part through mass antibiotic treatment. DNA-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are currently used to evaluate the success of treatment programmes by measuring the prevalence of C trachomatis infection. Some believe that newer ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-based tests may be much more sensitive since bacterial rRNA is present in amounts up to 10 000 times that of genomic DNA. Others believe that rRNA-based tests are instead less sensitive but more specific, due to the presence of dead or subviable organisms that the test may not detect. This study compares an rRNA-based test to a DNA-based test for the detection of ocular C trachomatis infection in children living in trachoma-endemic villages."

CD011926,0,9715529,0,[Prevalence and follow-up of hepatitis C virus infection in pregnancy].,"Hepatitis C shows an increasing distribution in countries of western Europe. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C (anti-HCV) in pregnancy, to evaluate the risk factors for anti-HCV positive women and the course of hepatitis C during pregnancy. 3712 pregnant patients of the university hospital Grosshadern, Munich, were analyzed for anti-HCV, anti-HIV and hepatitis B surface antigen. Anti-HCV seropositive women were further tested with western blot and polymerase chain reaction for HCV-RNA. Thirty-five (0.94%) of the 3712 pregnant women were found anti-HCV positive. 20% of them had present or previous injection drug abuse, hereof one patient had an associated seropositivity for HIV. Parenteral transmission through blood transfusion was likely in 11%. However, no parenteral exposure was recognized in 57% of the anti-HCV positive patients. The presence of serum HCV-RNA was detected in 16 (57%) of the 28 patients tested. In 17% (6/35) of the anti-HCV positive pregnancies elevated liver enzymes were noted, which did not show any significant change during the course of pregnancy. In conclusion, the prevalence of hepatitis C in pregnancy is relatively high with nearly 1%-comparable to chronic hepatitis B infection. Selected pregnancy screening based on perceived high-risk groups alone fail to detect about 60% of HCV antibody-positive women. Pregnancy did not influence the course of hepatitis C."
CD011926,0,26115191,0,Human Parechovirus 3 Meningitis and Fatal Leukoencephalopathy.,"Human parechovirus 3 (HPeV3) is a picornavirus associated with neurologic disease in neonates. Human parechovirus 3 infection of preterm and term infants is associated with seizures and destructive periventricular white matter lesions. Despite unremarkable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), HPeV3 RNA can be amplified from CSF and nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs. We report pathologic findings in 2 autopsy cases of infants with active HPeV3 infection. Both children were born approximately 1 month premature and were neurologically intact but, after a few weeks, developed seizures and radiologic evidence of white matter lesions. Neuropathologic examination demonstrated classic severe periventricular leukomalacia in the absence of an immune response. Human parechovirus 3 sequences were identified in RNA extracted from CSF, sera, and tissues. Human parechovirus 3 in situ hybridization detection of infected cells was limited to meninges and associated blood vessels in addition to smooth muscle of pulmonary vessels. Ultrastructural evaluation of meninges demonstrated dense core structures compatible with picornavirus virions. These findings suggest that encephalopathic changes are secondary to infection of meninges and potential compromise of vascular perfusion. Thus, parechovirus infection of vascular smooth muscle may be a more general pathogenic process."
CD011926,0,11136760,0,Early detection of acute rhinovirus infections by a rapid reverse transcription-PCR assay.,"The development of a rhinovirus (RV)-RNA-specific reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay is complicated by the close homology between the RV and enterovirus (EV) genomes in the highly conserved 5'-noncoding region, which is chosen for primer design in most RT-PCR assays. We have developed a sensitive, rapid, and RV-specific nested RT-PCR assay and have used it to test nasopharyngeal aspirates from 556 patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections. RV RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR not only in all of 52 samples that were RV positive by virus isolation methods but also in 124 of 367 samples that were negative by virus isolation methods and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, in 23 of 137 samples that were positive for a different respiratory virus by virus isolation and/or ELISA, RV RNA was detected by RT-PCR. EVs, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, coronaviruses, and influenza and parainfluenza viruses, including clinical isolates as well as stock viruses, were not amplified in our RV-specific RT-PCR assay, indicating that this assay was highly specific. The processing time was less than 2 days for the RT-PCR, as opposed to up to 2 weeks for virus isolation. These results indicate that nested RT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional methods for the detection of RV in patients experiencing acute respiratory tract infections and represents the only reliable tool for the early laboratory diagnosis of RV infections. This is especially important in light of new opportunities for therapy currently being developed."
CD011926,0,18573928,0,"Temporal and spatial distribution of clonal complexes of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics in Belgium, 1997 to 2004.","We performed multilocus sequence typing on 203 invasive disease isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to assess the clonal compositions of isolates from two provinces in Belgium and to determine the relationship between clones and antibiotic nonsusceptibility, particularly nonsusceptibility to two or more classes of antibiotics. The frequency of multiclass nonsusceptibility (MCNS) was higher in the province of West Flanders (38%) than in Limburg (21%). This difference was largely attributable to five clonal complexes (CC156, CC81, CC143, CC193, and CC1848), which contained high proportions of isolates with MCNS (>47%) and which were circulating at higher frequencies in West Flanders. The S. pneumoniae population changed over time, as CC156 and CC81 declined in frequency from 1997 to 1999 to 2001 to 2004. Over the same time period, the frequency of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7 (PCV7) serotypes dropped from 69% to 41%. In contrast, the nonvaccine serotype 19A increased in frequency from 2.1% to 6.6%. None of these changes can be attributed to PCV7 vaccine, as it was not in use in Belgium during the time period studied. There was evidence that MCNS clones flowed from West Flanders to Limburg."
CD011926,0,25634073,0,"Candidemia-induced pediatric sepsis and its association with free radicals, nitric oxide, and cytokine level in host.","Candida species has become the seventh most frequent causal microorganisms of nosocomial sepsis. Prematurity and low birth weights are strongly associated with the development of neonatal nosocomial bloodstream infections. Candida albicans has been the species most often associated with neonatal infections, but recently, there has been a changing pattern in the isolates recovered from neonates with invasive candidiasis, which poses resistance to the existing class of azoles such as fluconazole antifungals along with cross resistance to newer triazoles, which results in a therapeutic challenge in invasive fungal infections causing high incidence of mortality. Candida species was isolated from blood of neonates and children younger than 15 years admitted to hospital and susceptible for Candida-induced sepsis. Polymerase chain reaction-based identification and confirmation of individual Candida species were done using DNA sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility assay and resistance pattern for fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin were done for all the isolates. Furthermore, the change in free radical, cytokine release, and nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes isolated from control and pediatric sepsis cases were also performed. The present study probably for the first time reports the change in increasing incidence of nonalbicans Candida-induced sepsis in neonates and children admitted to the intensive care unit of hospital, and current antibiotics load posing resistance for antifungal treatment strategy and provide serious threats in future treatment. The increase in free radicals in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and increase in expression of nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide release in Candida-infected pediatric sepsis cases underlie the role of host factor in dissemination and invasiveness of infection from exogenous sources and pathogenesis of systemic inflammation during sepsis."
CD011926,0,22930516,0,"Phylogenetic analysis of rubella virus strains during an outbreak in São Paulo, 2007-2008.","Rubella virus (RV) is an important human pathogen that causes rubella, an acute contagious disease. It also causes severe birth defects collectively known as congenital rubella syndrome when infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. Here, we present the phylogenetic analysis of RV that circulated in São Paulo during the 2007-2008 outbreak. Samples collected from patients diagnosed with rubella were isolated in cell culture and sequenced. RV RNA was obtained from samples or RV-infected cell cultures and amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sequences were assigned to genotypes by phylogenetic analysis using RV reference sequences. Seventeen sequences were analyzed, and three genotypes were identified: 1a, 1G, and 2B. Genotypes 1a and 1G, which were isolated in 2007, were responsible for sporadic rubella cases in São Paulo. Thereafter, in late 2007, the epidemiological conditions changed, resulting in a large RV outbreak with the clear dominance of genotype 2B. The results of this study provide new approaches for monitoring the progress of elimination of rubella from São Paulo, Brazil."
CD011926,0,24982837,0,Evaluation of a real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of Kingella kingae and Staphylococcus aureus from synovial fluid in suspected septic arthritis.,"Direct plating of synovial fluid (SF) on agar-based media often fails to identify pathogens in septic arthritis (SA). We developed a PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Kingella kingae and Staphylococcus aureus from SF to evaluate molecular detection in SF and to estimate the incidence of K. kingae in SA in North America. The assay was based on detection of the cpn60 gene of K. kingae and the spa gene of S. aureus in multiplex real-time PCR. K. kingae was identified in 50% of patients between 0 and 5 yr of age (n=6) but not in any patients >18 yr old (n=105). Direct plating of SF on agar-based media failed to detect K. kingae in all samples. The PCR assay was inferior to the culture-based method for S. aureus, detecting only 50% of culture-positive cases. Our findings suggest that K. kingae is a common pathogen in pediatric SA in North America, in agreement with previous reports from Europe. PCR-based assays for the detection of K. kingae may be considered in children with SA, especially in those with a high degree of clinical suspicion."

A prospective clinical surveillance that included all children hospitalized with culture- and/or PCR-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was performed in all Madrid hospitals. The incidence rates (IRs) (defined as the number of cases/100,000 inhabitants aged <15 years) in the PCV7 (May 2007 to April 2010) versus PCV13 (May 2011 to April 2012) periods were compared. There were 499 cases in the PCV7 period and 79 cases in the PCV13 period. Globally, the IR significantly decreased from 17.09 (PCV7 period) to 7.70 (PCV13 period), with significant decreases (PCV7 versus PCV13 periods) in all age groups for bacteremic pneumonia (5.51 versus 1.56), parapneumonic pneumococcal empyema (PPE) (5.72 versus 3.12), and meningitis (2.16 versus 0.97). In the PCV13 period, significant reductions (the IR in the PCV7 period versus the IR in the PCV13 period) were found in IPDs caused by PCV13 serotypes (13.49 versus 4.38), and specifically by serotypes 1 (globally [4.79 versus 2.53], for bacteremic pneumonia [2.23 versus 0.97], and for PPE [2.26 versus 1.17]), serotype 5 (globally [1.88 versus 0.00], for bacteremic pneumonia [0.89 versus 0.00], and for PPE [0.55 versus 0.00]), and serotype 19A (globally [3.77 versus 0.49], for bacteremic pneumonia [0.72 versus 0.00], for PPE [0.89 versus 0.00], and for meningitis [0.62 versus 0.00]). IPDs caused by non-PCV13 serotypes did not increase (IR, 3.60 in the PCV7 period versus 3.31 in the PCV13 period), regardless of age or presentation. No IPDs caused by the PCV13 serotypes were found in children who received 3 doses of PCV13. The number of hospitalization days and sanitary costs were significantly lower in the PCV13 period. The switch from PCV7 to PCV13 in the universal pediatric vaccination calendar provided sanitary and economical benefits without a replacement by non-PCV13 serotypes."

CD011926,0,25073523,0,Acute parvovirus B19 infection in identical twins unmasking previously unidentified hereditary spherocytosis.,"Identical Caucasian male twins, previously fit, presented 1 week apart with short histories of fever and lethargy. The twins were febrile at presentation with profound pancytopaenia and evidence of haemolysis. There was no rash or arthralgia. Both required multiple red cell transfusions. The twins had positive IgM serology for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and parvovirus B19. EBV viral capsid antigen and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgGs were also positive however, suggesting past EBV exposure. Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected from peripheral blood PCR; CMV and EBV DNA PCRs were negative. Convalescent serology demonstrated no evolution of the CMV serological response, that is no IgG to CMV developed which implies an initial non-specific polyclonal IgM response. The twins recovered fully over 7 days, the first with a course of prednisolone and the second spontaneously. They were diagnosed with hereditary spherocytosis on convalescent blood films. On further questioning, a family history of hereditary spherocytosis was eventually revealed. The twins' maternal grandmother was known to have the condition asymptomatically. Their mother had prior to this never been tested, but later bloods would reveal a compatible biochemical picture."

Conducted in 2006, this study aimed at characterizing clinical manifestations and microbial features of isolates obtained from invasive Streptococcus pyogenes disease. Clinical and demographic data were collected prospectively. Isolates were biotyped, T typed, emm sequenced, and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Detection of the speA, speB, speC, and ssa genes was also carried out. The estimated annual incidence of invasive S. pyogenes disease in 2006 was high at 38 cases/100,000 inhabitants in New Caledonia. Invasive isolates were obtained from 90 patients with necrotizing fasciitis (41 cases), bacteremia with no identified focus (12 cases), myositis (10 cases), septic arthritis (9 cases), erysipelas (8 cases), postpartum infection (4 cases), myelitis and osteomyelitis (3 cases), severe pneumonia (2 cases), and endocarditis (1 case). The most frequent associated comorbidities were skin lesions (71%) and obesity (29%). Thirty-one different emm types were identified, and the following six accounted for 54% of the isolates: emm15 (15.5%), emm92 (12.2%), emm106 (8.9%), emm74 (6.7%), emm89 (5.6%), and emm109 (5.6%). The speA, speC, and ssa genes were expressed at different frequencies in the various emm types. The first epidemiological study of invasive S. pyogenes disease in New Caledonia highlights that emm type distribution is particular and should be taken into account in the development of an appropriate vaccine. These findings support the prevention of pyoderma and other cutaneous lesions in order to limit the development of both invasive disease and poststreptococcal sequelae in the South Pacific."

Accurate identification of causative agents is critical to case management and to prioritization in vaccine development. Sensitive multiplex diagnostics provide us with an opportunity to investigate the relative contributions of individual agents and may also facilitate the discovery of new pathogens. Recently, application of MassTag polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to undiagnosed influenza-like illness in New York State led to the discovery of a novel rhinovirus genotype. Here we report the investigation, by MassTag PCR, of pediatric respiratory-tract infections in Germany, studying 97 cases for which no pathogen was identified through routine laboratory evaluation. Respiratory viruses were identified in 49 cases (51%); of the 55 identified viruses, 41 (75%) were rhinoviruses. The novel genotype represented 73% of rhinoviruses and 55% of all identified viruses.

CD011926,0,20722553,0,Identification of bacteria in paraffin-embedded tissues using 16S rDNA sequencing from a neonate with necrotizing enterocolitis.,"The conventional approach to bacterial identification in paraffin-embedded tissue relies mainly on morphology, with the aid of Gram stain. This approach is only able to provide some clues; it does not offer the capability of accurate identification. Bacterial identification based on sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is able to identify bacteria to the species level. Here we demonstrate the application of this technique in the postmortem examination, for which we had obtained different results from premortem and postmortem blood cultures. In the postmortem examination, abundant gram-negative rods were present in gastrointestinal tract lumen and lymphatic space. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue of the above sections and subjected to 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction for the first 500 base pairs, followed by sequencing. The results of sequencing correlated well with the postmortem culture result. In this review, the newly emerging field of bacterial identification with molecular techniques employing both broad-range and targeted approaches and their clinical applications and limitations are discussed."

CD011926,0,1557264,0,An endemic strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus colonizing and causing bacteremia in neonatal intensive care unit patients.,"Coagulase-negative staphylococci are now the major cause of bacteremia in neonatal intensive care units. To date, coagulase-negative staphylococci causing neonatal infections have been found to be distinct when typed by standard techniques. To determine whether or not an endemic strain could be identified using more discriminatory techniques, we characterized coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates obtained from a prospective study of coagulase-negative staphylococci bacteremia in a neonatal intensive care unit during 1984 through 1985, by standard techniques supplemented with DNA-DNA hybridization and restriction endonuclease analysis. We typed 58 strains that were isolated from 52 episodes of bacteremia in 38 neonates. There were 46 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Three pairs of strains were identical, and each strain was from a different patient. There were 12 isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Ten were identical, referred to as strain TOR-35, and had been isolated from eight different infants. Characterization of strains obtained in 1986 from a prospective study of coagulase-negative staphylococci-colonizing neonates admitted to the same neonatal intensive care unit found the TOR-35 strain had colonized 6 of 17 neonates by day seven. A point prevalence survey of all neonates in the same neonatal intensive care unit in 1990 found 5 of 30 neonates to be colonized with the TOR-35 strain. Therefore, we were able to identify an endemic strain of S haemolyticus that caused multiple episodes of bacteremia during a 6-month period and remained present in the same environment for a 5-year period."
CD011926,0,8390471,0,Optimization for detection of cytomegalovirus by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinical samples.,"PCR is 100 times more sensitive than traditional tube culture for detecting cytomegalovirus (CMV) but may require up to 12 reactions per specimen (Sandin et al., 1991). In order to make the assay practical for use in a clinical laboratory the procedure used to detect CMV must be simplified. In this study, the effect of reducing the number of reactions per specimen on sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was evaluated. 53 residual samples from specimens processed for CMV by shell vial assay/routine tube tissue culture (SVA/TTC) were analyzed by PCR. The residual samples were separated into a supernatant and pellet fractions, then tested for CMV with primers to the immediate early (IEP) and late protein (LP) genes using a nested procedure. To exclude false negatives due to the presence of inhibitors in the sample fractions, all fractions were tested for the presence of the human myosin heavy chain gene also using a nested procedure. SVA/TTC had a sensitivity and specificity of 52/96% in comparison to PCR when data from all 12 PCR reactions was considered. However, high sensitivity and specificity were retained when only the data of the IEP primers with two samples were considered. The results from examining only the 1:10 dilution of pellet and the undiluted supernatant by PCR provided a 60% increase in sensitivity over SVA/TTC, high specificity and a clinically feasible assay."
CD011926,0,20007762,0,Diversity of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec structures in coagulase-negative staphylococci and relationship to drug resistance.,"The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements in meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) isolated from a tertiary-care hospital in Mexico and to examine the relationship to drug resistance. Fifty selected MR-CoNS isolates collected from catheters (n=15), blood (n=15), bone (n=9), bronchial lavage (n=2) and urine (n=2) and one isolate each from an abscess, cerebrospinal fluid, eye, pleural effusion, synovial fluid, tracheal aspirate and wound secretion were examined. Susceptibility testing was performed by the broth microdilution method. SCCmec types were determined by multiplex PCR and PFGE was carried out as described previously for Staphylococcus aureus. Among the MR-CoNS strains studied, the most frequently isolated species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=26) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=13). Staphylococcus cohnii (n=5), Staphylococcus hominis (n=3), Staphylococcus sciuri (n=1), Staphylococcus pasteuri (n=1) and the recently described species Staphylococcus pettenkoferi (n=1) were also identified. The most frequent MR-CoNS genotype identified was SCCmec type IVa in S. epidermidis isolates, which also showed a high diversity in their PFGE patterns. A clone was found that amplified both SCCmec III and V elements in five isolates examined. The single MR S. pettenkoferi isolate harboured SCCmec type IVd and the single MR S. pasteuri isolate harboured SCCmec type I. The carriage of SCCmec type III was associated with resistance or intermediate resistance to meropenem (P <0.05). These results confirm the high prevalence of S. epidermidis SCCmec IVa and the high genetic diversity among MR-CoNS strains. As far as is known, this is the first report describing the newly identified S. pettenkoferi possessing SCCmec IVd and S. pasteuri harbouring SCCmec type I. MR-CoNS harbouring SCCmec type III were found to be more resistant to meropenem."

CD011926,0,21258263,0,Necrotizing enterocolitis is associated with ureaplasma colonization in preterm infants.,"The study objective was to determine whether Ureaplasma respiratory tract colonization of preterm infants <33 wk gestation is associated with an increased risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). One or more tracheal or nasopharyngeal aspirates for Ureaplasma culture and PCR were obtained during the first week of life from 368 infants <33 wk gestation enrolled from 1999 to 2003 or from 2007 to 2009. NEC Bell stage ≥ 2 was confirmed by radiological criteria, and pathology, if available. Cord serum samples were analyzed for IL-6 and IL-1β concentrations, and placentas were reviewed for histological chorioamnionitis in the first cohort. NEC was confirmed in 29 of 368 (7.9%) of the combined cohorts. The incidence of NEC was 2.2-fold higher in Ureaplasma-positive (12.3%) than Ureaplasma-negative (5.5%) infants <33 wk (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.13-5.2; p = 0.023) and 3.3-fold higher in Ureaplasma-positive (14.6%) than Ureaplasma-negative (4.4%) infants ≤ 28 wk (OR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.36-9.93; p = 0.01). Age of onset, hematologic parameters at onset, and NEC severity were similar between Ureaplasma-positive and negative infants. Cord serum IL-6 and IL-1β concentrations were significantly higher in Ureaplasma-positive than in Ureaplasma-negative NEC-affected infants. Ureaplasma may be a factor in NEC pathogenesis in preterm infants by contributing to intestinal mucosal injury and/or altering systemic or local immune responses."

CD011926,0,15280124,0,Foscarnet therapy for congenital cytomegalovirus liver fibrosis following prenatal ascites.,"We report on an infant with multi-system disease including liver fibrosis, right microphthalmia with cataract, interstitial pneumonitis, and hyperechoic lesions in the basal ganglia and in the periventricular and thalamic regions. Prenatal ascites with hepatomegaly concomitantly with detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in the amniotic fluid, following recurrent maternal CMV infection, had been shown. Although CMV culture and DNA detection were negative in the urine, the infant was given foscarnet because CMV infection was demonstrated in the liver by DNA detection and immunohistochemical staining. Favorable clinical outcome and absence of CMV in the liver were subsequently shown. Our case suggests that congenital CMV disease following maternal recurrence may not be associated with disseminated infection but only with intracellular infection. The diagnosis should therefore be based on CMV detection in the involved organs. Moreover, this is the first report on the possible efficacy and safety of foscarnet for therapy of immunocompetent infants with congenital CMV disease."

Blood and insect specimens were collected and environmental assessments were done. Case-patients (n = 22) were defined by fever, anemia, and intra-erythrocytic coccobacilli seen in thin smears. Most case-patients were children (median age = 6.5 years). Case-patients more frequently reported sand fly bites than individuals of neighboring households (odds ratio [OR] = 5.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-39.2), or members from randomly selected households > or = 5 km away (OR = 8.5, 95% CI = 1.7-57.9). Bartonella bacilliformis isolated from blood was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (citrate synthase [g/tA], 338 basepairs). Using bacterial isolation (n = 141) as the standard, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of thin smears were 36%, 96%, and 44%, respectively. Patients with clinical syndromes compatible with bartonellosis should be treated with appropriate antibiotics regardless of thin-smear results."

Improved eradication of GBS colonization and disease may involve universal screening in conjunction with rapid diagnostic technologies or other novel approaches. Given the complications and potential limitations associated with maternal intrapartum prophylaxis, however, vaccines may be the most effective means of preventing neonatal GBS disease. The global utility of conjugated GBS vaccines may be hampered by the variability of serotypes in diverse populations and geographic locations. Modern technologies, such as those involving proteomics and genomic sequencing, are likely to hasten the development of a universal vaccine against GBS."
CD011926,0,21816195,0,Hospital-based surveillance of rotavirus gastroenteritis in the era of limited vaccine uptake through the private sector.,"To investigate possible impact of limited vaccine uptake by the private sector since 2007, a prospective observational study included all children <5 years hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in a Tertiary Care Hospital between 09/2006 and 08/2010. Rotavirus (RV) antigen was detected in stools by a rapid immunochromatographic test and genotype analysis was performed on positive samples by RT-PCR. Compared to 2006-2008, the likelihood of rotavirus infection was significantly reduced among children hospitalized for AGE in 2008-2010 (OR 0.64; 95%CI: 0.49-0.84, p<0.001). This was mainly due to the reduction of RVGE cases in infants 0-11 months (p=0.035). Moreover, RVGE cases as well as the rate of RVGE/10,000 hospitalized children significantly decreased (p=0.009 and p=0.010 respectively). No children with rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) had received any vaccine dose. G4P [8] was the most common genotype (64/90). In conclusion, this study indicates that even low RV vaccination coverage may have significant effect."

During the summer months, 247 specimens from children with diarrhoea and 1108 from asymptomatic children were analysed for the presence of EPEC and other bacterial pathogens. Potential enteric pathogens were identified in 140 cases of children with diarrhoea (56.7%). EPEC was the most frequently identified agent (111 cases), followed by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (13), Shigella (9), Salmonella (6) and Aeromonas sp. (1). EPEC isolates were examined for the presence of eaeA, bfpA and stx genes by PCR. EPEC isolates were classified as typical (eaeA+ bfpA+) or atypical (eaeA+ bfpA-). Typical EPEC was diagnosed in 35 cases (11.8%), compared with 8 (0.4%) in the asymptomatic group (P<0.05). Atypical EPEC strains were isolated from 23 cases (9.3%), compared with 13 (1.2%) of the healthy control group (P<0.05).

CD011926,0,22052551,0,Clinical evaluation of multiplex real-time PCR panels for rapid detection of respiratory viral infections.,"Respiratory viral infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, particularly in children, the elderly and immunocompromised persons. Rapid identification of viral etiology is critical in ruling out non-viral infections, initiating antiviral treatment and limiting the spread of the infection. Multiplex assays of more than one viral gene target in a single tube have the advantage of rapid screening of a large number of potential viral pathogens in a short time. A multiplex real-time PCR assay was used in this study for detection of respiratory RNA and DNA viral infections in 728 specimens received from 585 adult and pediatric patients comprised of symptomatic and asymptomatic organ transplant recipients and non-recipients for diagnosis of respiratory illnesses and for routine clinical monitoring. Multiplex PCR was more sensitive than the multiplex immunofluoresence culture assay (R-mix) and also detected additional respiratory viruses that were not covered by the R-mix panel. The number of respiratory viruses detected in symptomatic patients was significantly higher than asymptomatic patients in both adult and pediatric patients. Herpesviral infections were the predominant cause of lower respiratory tract infection in the organ transplant recipients, whereas respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen in non-transplant patients particularly children. Multiplex real-time PCR for detection of respiratory viruses has the potential for rapid identification of viral pathogens. In this era of emerging viral infections, addition of newer viral targets to the multiplex PCR panels will be beneficial in determining both patient management and public health epidemiology."

This study aimed to assess child outcomes among HIV-positive (n=19) and AIDS (n=22) mothers from Central West Brazil. CD4(+) T-cell counts (FACScount, BD) and viral loads (HIV-1 RT-PCR, Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Roche) were assessed at delivery and during the first 6 months of life. Heteroduplex mobility assay identified env and gag HIV-1 subtypes. Frequencies and medians were calculated. HIV-positive and AIDS mothers did not differ with regard to age, antiretroviral prophylaxis, parity and viral load. AIDS mothers had lower CD4(+) T-cell counts. One vertical transmission and a neonatal death were observed. Gestational age, gender and oral zidovudine prophylaxis were similar regardless of maternal clinical status. Infants born to AIDS mothers had lower birthweight and shorter time to seroreversion. Eight infants were lost to follow-up, and two were breastfed due to delayed maternal diagnosis. HIV-1 B(env)/B(gag) subtype were 75.6%; discordant B(env)/F(gag) were 12.2%. Exposed uninfected infants born to AIDS mothers with lower CD4(+) T-cell counts seroreverted earlier than infants born to asymptomatic HIV-positive mothers.

CD011926,0,25242311,0,Case of a healthy infant born following antenatal enterovirus myocarditis and hydrops.,"Fetal hydrops and myocarditis were diagnosed in a woman at 32 weeks of gestation (WG). Transplacental enterovirus infection was suspected because all other causes of myocarditis and hydrops were excluded, it was during an endemic period, and there was a setting of maternal infection (fever a few days before). We opted for in utero treatment because of the risk of resuscitating a neonate with myocarditis and hydrops. We administered dexamethasone 12mg twice for pulmonary maturation and presumed it would partially improve the myocarditis. Fetal arrhythmia was noted at 35 WG and we decided to deliver the infant as postnatal treatment of the heart disorder would be more effective. RT-PCR (ARGENE(®)) showed that the neonate's throat and anal tissues and cord blood sampled on the day of birth contained enterovirus ribonucleic acid and coxsackievirus B5, as did the mother's anal sample. Laboratory tests, heart MRI and probably brain MRI indicated neonatal enterovirus infection. Findings were normal at two-year follow-up."

The Listeria monocytogenes serovar (SV) 1/2b isolates shared pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (fAFLP) patterns indistinguishable from those from five food producers. The seven human isolates, a control strain with a different PFGE/fAFLP profile and ten food isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) in a blinded fashion. A gene-by-gene comparison (multilocus sequence typing (MLST)+) was performed, and the resulting whole genome allelic profiles were compared using SeqSphere(+) software version 1.0. On analysis of 2298 genes, the four human outbreak isolates from 2012 to 2013 had different alleles at ≤6 genes, i.e. differed by ≤6 genes from each other; the dendrogram placed these isolates in between five Austrian unaged soft cheese isolates from producer A (≤19-gene difference from the human cluster) and two Austrian ready-to-eat meat isolates from producer B (≤8-gene difference from the human cluster). Both food products appeared on grocery bills prospectively collected by these outbreak cases after hospital discharge. Epidemiological results on food consumption and MLST+ clearly separated the three cases in 2011 from the four 2012-2013 outbreak cases (≥48 different genes). We showed that WGS is capable of discriminating L. monocytogenes SV1/2b clones not distinguishable by PFGE and fAFLP. The listeriosis outbreak described clearly underlines the potential of sequence-based typing methods to offer enhanced resolution and comparability of typing systems for public health applications."
CD011926,0,1964500,0,In situ hybridization analysis for cytomegalovirus in chronic villitis.,"Chronic villitis with villous lymphoplasmacytic, histiocytic infiltrate and stromal necrosis may have various etiologies. Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a frequent cause of such villitis, but the nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions diagnostic of CMV are often not apparent. In this study placentas with chronic villitis were analyzed for CMV DNA by means of in situ hybridization. Of the eight cases of chronic villitis studied, three demonstrated inclusions diagnostic of CMV infection. On in situ hybridization, three additional cases had detectable CMV DNA. CMV was detected in endothelial, histiocytic, and fibroblastic cells and occasionally in the trophoblast. In cases with characteristic CMV inclusions, CMV DNA was often present in cells that lacked inclusions. CMV DNA was not detected in unremarkable placental tissue obtained from normal deliveries. It is concluded that CMV is commonly found in lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic villitis and that in situ analysis for CMV is a rapid, easy, and sensitive way to detect the virus in placentas."

CD011926,0,8925124,0,Detection and significance of adenoviruses in cases of sudden infant death.,"Respiratory tract infections have been thought to act as a trigger mechanism in sudden infant death. In 118 autopsy cases of infant death, paraffin-embedded or frozen lung tissues were investigated by means of a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect adenovirus (AV) DNA. The primers used are general primers and allow the detection of most pathogenic adenoviruses with high specificity and sensitivity and independently of devitalization of viruses or degradation of viral DNA. For the investigation three groups were established: there were 13 cases of unnatural death, 78 cases of natural death without histological signs of interstitial pneumonia, and 27 cases with interstitial pneumonia. The first group was AV negative. In the group without interstitial pneumonia AV was detected in 10.2% of the cases. In the group with interstitial pneumonia the frequency of AV detection was almost 26%. The results obtained demonstrate an association between interstitial pneumonia and detection of AV DNA, indicating that AV may play an important part in pulmonary infection in infants. Histological evidence of interstitial pneumonia was not observed in all AV-positive cases, perhaps because nonspecific virus-related changes occurred only in early stages of viral infection. Comparison of the AV frequency in SIDS (25%) and non-SIDS cases (4%) indicates an association between pulmonary AV infections and sudden death. These results support the working hypothesis of respiratory infections acting as a trigger mechanism in sudden infant death."

However, the clonal status of these strains is not known. A total of 94 EPEC isolates from 80 children with diarrhoea and 14 healthy matched controls isolated during 1991-1992 and 1993-1994 was characterised by serogrouping, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR, and by a biochemical fingerprinting method (the phene plate or PhP system). Twelve O serogroups were found with O114 (n = 19) and O127 (n = 23) being the dominant serogroups. Most strains of O114 belonged to the same PhP/PCR types. Strains of O127 contained 16 that produced cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) and seven that did not; both were found among patients as well as controls. Results of PCR and PhP typing showed that CDT-positive strains belonged to the same clonal group and were related to one of the two PhP/PCR types of CDT-negative O127 strains. Thirty-one EPEC strains were O non-typable and 21 strains belonged to other less prevalent serogroups. These strains belonged to diverse PhP/PCR types and did not show any similarity to the strains of two major serogroups, O114 and O127. The results suggest that two clonal groups of EPEC strains are predominantly associated with childhood diarrhoea in Bangladesh."
CD011926,0,22116158,0,Rapid genotyping of cytomegalovirus in dried blood spots by multiplex real-time PCR assays targeting the envelope glycoprotein gB and gH genes.,"Genotyping of cytomegalovirus (CMV) is useful to examine potential differences in the pathogenicity of strains and to demonstrate coinfection with multiple strains involved in CMV disease in adults and congenitally infected newborns. Studies on genotyping of CMV in dried blood spots (DBS) are rare and have been hampered by the small amount of dried blood available. In this study, two multiplex real-time PCR assays for rapid gB and gH genotyping of CMV in DBS were developed. Validation of the assays with 39 CMV-positive plasma samples of transplant recipients and 21 urine specimens of congenitally infected newborns was successful in genotyping 100% of the samples, with gB1 and gB3 being the most prevalent genotypes. Multiple gB and gH genotypes were detected in 36% and 33% of the plasma samples, respectively. One urine sample from a newborn with symptomatic congenital CMV was positive for gB1 and gB2. DBS of congenitally infected newborns (n = 41) were tested using 9 μl of dried blood, and genotypes were detected in 81% (gB) and 73% (gH) of the samples, with gB3 being the most prevalent genotype. No clear association of specific genotypes with clinical outcome was observed. In conclusion, the CMV gB and gH PCR assays were found to be rapid, sensitive for detecting mixed infections, and suitable for direct usage on DBS. These assays are efficient tools for genotyping of CMV in DBS of congenitally infected newborns."

DESIGN Clinical and surveillance specimens collected during clinical care and outbreak investigation. PATIENTS A total of 17 neonates hospitalized in a 43-bed level III NICU in northeastern Florida from December 2010 to October 2011 were included in this study. METHODS We assessed epidemiological data in conjunction with 4 typing methods: antibiograms, PFGE, spa types, and phylogenetic analysis of genome-wide SNPs. RESULTS Among the 17 type USA300 isolates, 4 different spa types were identified using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Phylogenetic analysis identified 5 infants as belonging to 2 clusters of epidemiologically linked cases and excluded 10 unlinked cases from putative transmission events. The availability of these results during the initial investigation would have improved infection control interventions. CONCLUSION Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis are invaluable tools for epidemic investigation; they identify transmission events and exclude cases mistakenly implicated by traditional typing methods. When routinely applied to surveillance and investigation in the clinical setting, this approach may provide actionable intelligence for measured, appropriate, and effective interventions."

Two real-time PCR assays, targeting the non-structural protein (NP-1) and viral protein (VP-1) genes, were designed and validated to detect HBoV in patients with respiratory disease, gastroenteritis, or systemic illness. Sensitivity of the NP-1 and VP-1 assays were equal to the conventional PCR assay previously described by Allander et al. [2005: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102: 12891-12896] being 100%, and giving specificity of 94% and 93%, respectively. There was no cross-reaction identified with unrelated respiratory agents, or to human DNA. The limits of detection were 10 copies of genomic DNA equivalents per reaction for both assays. The assays were used to screen three different sample populations, combined nose, and throat swabs (n = 96) from children with acute respiratory disease, fecal samples (n = 375) from adults, and children with gastroenteritis and whole blood (n = 229) collected from 31 immunocompromised children taken over an 18-month period. In total 17 (18%) respiratory samples and 18 (4.8%) fecal samples were identified as having HBoV present. Of the pediatric whole blood specimens investigated, HBoV was detected in six (2.6%) samples from four patients. In summary, two real-time PCR assays targeting different genes were designed and validated for use as screening methods for the detection of HBoV. HBoV was found in three different specimen types: parent-collected combined nose-throat swabs, fecal samples collected from symptomatic individuals and whole blood from immunocompromised children."

Because a newborn can acquire GBS during and after delivery, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that pregnant women be screened for rectovaginal GBS colonization during the antepartum period between weeks 35 and 37 of gestation and, if they are colonized, that intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis be administered. A prospective investigational study was undertaken from 2 May 2006 to 14 August 2006 at three sites to establish the performance characteristics of the Smart GBS LB assay on the SmartCycler II system for detecting GBS colonization in subjects in the antepartum period from combined vaginal/rectal swab-based specimens after broth enrichment. Results were compared to broth enrichment culture and to the predicate device, the BD GeneOhm StrepB direct assay. The collected specimens were randomized for swab testing order. Each swab sample was processed simultaneously by culture, Smart GBS LB assay, and the BD GeneOhm StrepB assay. A total of 310 subjects were enrolled, with 306 subject results included in the study. Compared to enrichment culture, the Smart GBS LB assay demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 98.6%, 90.4%, 77.1%, and 99.5%, respectively. The Smart GBS LB assay demonstrated substantially equivalent or better performance than culture or the predicate device.

Urine samples from 40 children with acute pyelonephritis, 16 children at 6-wk follow-up and 15 children with nonrenal fever were analyzed using ELISA. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were compared with the outcome of pyelonephritis as measured by renal static scintigraphy. A mouse model of acute ascending pyelonephritis was used to localize the sites of production and the kinetics of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Human renal epithelial A498 cells, primary mesangial cells and monocytic THP-1 cells were stimulated by Escherichia coli. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and protein production by ELISA. We demonstrate a significant increase of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the urine of children with acute pyelonephritis. Both proteins were produced mainly by leukocytes, and TIMP-1 also by resident kidney cells. Cells reacted differently after stimulation by bacteria. In mesangial cells and monocytes a decreased constitutive TIMP-1 production was found, which was in contrast to epithelial cells. Out of 40 children with pyelonephritis, 23 had higher urinary TIMP-1 than MMP-9 levels. These children had significantly more severe changes in both acute and follow-up scintigraphy scans indicating higher degree of acute tissue damage and renal scarring. Thus, our findings suggest an association between TIMP-1 and the process of renal scarring."

Seventeen neonates, born to mothers with positive Trypanosoma cruzi serology were analyzed by serologic, parasitological and molecular procedures, in blood samples taken at birth, and when aged 2-4 and 9 months. For a better comparison of sensitivity between both parasitological methods (microhematocrit and PCR), the number of samples of neonates studied at birth extended to 121. In children followed-up until 9 months of age, a 100% correlation between PCR and routine diagnosis was found, with PCR showing its highest sensitivity from Month 2 onwards. Comparative analysis between both parasitological methods, on samples taken at birth, showed a higher sensitivity of PCR respect the microhematocrit (P < 0.0008)."

It is a multifactorial disease caused by the interaction between environmental and genetic factors. The aim of this study is to identify genetic variants contributing to BPD development using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. We prospectively evaluated 378 premature newborn infants with a gestational age <32 weeks in a multicentre study from 12 Italian neonatal intensive care unit from 2009 to 2012. Infants were divided into two groups: normal controls (225) and BPD-affected infants (141) with mild (65, 46.1%), moderate (40, 28.4%) and severe (36, 25.5%) BPD. BPD was more frequent in infants with lower weight and gestational age. Antenatal steroid administration was more frequent in the control group. Postnatal infection, respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arterious, cerebral haemorrhage, surfactant administration, ventilatory support, diuretics and postnatal steroid administration correlated with severity of BPD. Among BPD, moderate and severe cases will be selected as BPD ""extreme phenotypes"", and in fact variations in 28-day oxygen need-based BPD were previously shown to be fully attributable to environmental effects whereas dependence on supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks seems to better reflect underlying genetic susceptibility. Exome analysis by NGS is in progress. Identifications of genetic markers predisposing to BPD may allow development of personalized and preventive treatments."

CD011926,0,1703618,0,Improved detection of rotavirus shedding by polymerase chain reaction.,"To improve identification of children excreting rotavirus a method for the amplification of rotavirus RNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed. The assay was compared with a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay in the detection of rotavirus shedding by infants in hospital during the winter peak of rotavirus infections. Forty children were studied in an intermediate care unit after transfer from intensive care units. Only two were admitted primarily because of diarrhoea; the other thirty-eight were admitted for management of various other disorders. Rotavirus shedding was detected by enzyme immunoassay in twenty of the infants, and nine of these (aged 1 week to 8 months) remained in hospital for more than 5 days after the initial detection of rotavirus and could be studied long term. Of 103 faecal samples from the nine infants, 60 (58%) contained rotavirus RNA detected by reverse-transcriptase (RT)/PCR, whereas only 37 (36%) were positive for rotavirus antigen by the immunoassay (chi 2 = 10.3, p less than 0.002). The geometric mean time of rotavirus shedding was 9.5 (range 1-19) days as detected by RT/PCR and 5.7 (range 1-17) days by the immunoassay (p less than 0.018). In five of the nine children, RT/PCR detected rotavirus shedding for 2-7 days longer than the immunoassay and in four children RT/PCR was positive 1 or more days before rotavirus antigen was detected. Further studies should attempt to find out whether infected infants are capable of spreading wild-type virus during periods when they are not shedding antigen as detectable by enzyme immunoassay."

A total of 46 clinical microbiology laboratories from 12 different regions of Turkey (Istanbul; Eastern and Western Marmara; Eastern and Western Blacksea; Aegean; Mediterranean; Western, Central, Northeastern, Middle-eastern and Southeastern Anatolia) participated in the study. Accordingly, GAS strains isolated from sterile body sites (blood, cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial fluids) in the study centers between June 2010-June 2011, were sent to Maltepe University Hospital Clinical Microbiology Laboratory for microbiological confirmation and further analysis. The isolates were identified by conventional methods, and for serotyping, opacity factor (OF) and T protein types were investigated. For genotyping GAS lysate preparation, emm gene amplification and sequencing were performed by using the protocols recommended by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 65 invasive GAS strains were isolated in 15 of the participant centers, during the study period. The rate of invasive GAS isolation exhibited regional variation, with the highest rates in the Eastern Blacksea (Trabzon, n= 19), followed by Istanbul (n= 17) and Western Anatolia (Ankara, Konya, n= 14). Of the patients with invasive GAS infection 33 were female, 32 were male, with the age range of 0-89 years. GAS strains were most commonly isolated from soft tissue specimens (n= 18), followed by abscess material (n= 10), sterile body fluids (n= 8) and blood (n= 7) samples. Serotyping revealed that 55% (36/65) of the strains were OF positive, and the majority of T protein was polygroup T (n= 20), followed by U (n= 14), B (n= 5), X (n= 3) and Y (n= 2). T protein was not detected in 22 isolates. The strains were found to have 17 different emm types;emm1 (n= 13), emm4 (n= 6), emm6 (n= 6), emm12 (n= 6), emm24 (n= 4), emm14 (n= 3) and emm28 (n= 3). Nine of the strains could not be typed by sequencing. The correlation between emm typing and serotyping was detected as 58%. It was observed that 26-valent vaccines included 70.5% of the invasive GAS strains included in this study. Our study provided initial data concerning the epidemiological properties of invasive GAS infections and characterization of GAS strains in Turkey. The incidence of invasive GAS infections is low in our country. Although immunization programme by 26-valent GAS vaccine is not currently an urgent public health issue for our country, the results of this study indicated that emm types 4 and 24 should better be included in such a vaccine to be used in Turkey. Additionally, since epidemiological features of GAS infections and the microbiological characteristics of the strains can vary by time, for the diagnosis of invasive streptococcal infections and to take the necessary preventive measures, epidemiological studies should be conducted repeatedly."

Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) had been performed routinely for diagnosis of enterovirus (EV) infection among hospitals in a geographical cluster. The aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology and the clinical pattern of EV-related hospital admission in 2010, and evaluate the impact of RT-PCR compared to conventional method. This was a retrospective study and patients with laboratory confirmed EV infection were included. Demographic information, clinical features, complications, and laboratory findings were analyzed. Among the 113 patients identified, HFMD was the most common presentation (84/113, 74%), followed by meningitis (10/113, 9%). Respiratory (52/113, 46%) and gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting (36/113, 32%) and diarrhea (15/113, 13%) were quite common. For cases with central nervous system (CNS) or myocardial complications, there were significantly fewer oral ulcer and rash over hands and feet compared to their counter group. Serious infection mainly affected children younger than 1-year old and adults. Dual infection was noted among seven patients (6%). Compared to RT-PCR, conventional virus isolation detected only 14-16% of the infections. The relative low culture positive rate could be explained by the circulation of Coxsackie A6 in 2010 which was difficult to be isolated by cell culture. Diagnosis of EV infection among hospitalized patients may not be straightforward. EV RT-PCR significantly improved laboratory diagnosis and delineation of epidemiology of EV infection compared to conventional methods."

It is either an isolated clinical finding or one of the clinical findings included in several malformation syndromes linked to a microdeletion within a chromosomal region 22q11.2. Some malformations in that region are associated with serious cardiovascular anomalies. Nowadays, standard diagnostic techniques for detecting aberrations within the chromosomal region 22q11.2 are fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA). This short report describes an eutrophic female newborn whose both lip corners are symmetrically positioned while at rest; while crying, left lip corner and left half of the lower lip are falling. She also has partial bilateral syndactyly between second and third toe, open foramen ovale and by ultrasound detected hyperechogenic region in the thalamus and brain parenchyme. Aiming to investigate etiopathogenesis of the newborn asymmetric crying and accompanying minor abnormalities, we have tried to verify or exclude: microdeletion syndrome, TORCH infection and birth injury. Recognising such a paresis soon after the delivery is of great importance and can be helpful in detecting other accompanying anomalies, especially cardiovascular anomalies."
CD011926,0,25650570,0,Fluorescent immunochromatography for rapid and sensitive typing of seasonal influenza viruses.,"Lateral flow tests also known as Immunochromatography (IC) is an antigen-detection method conducted on a nitrocellulose membrane that can be completed in less than 20 min. IC has been used as an important rapid test for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of influenza viruses, but the IC sensitivity is relatively low (approximately 60%) and the limit of detection (LOD) is as low as 10³ pfu per reaction. Recently, we reported an improved IC assay using antibodies conjugated with fluorescent beads (fluorescent immunochromatography; FLIC) for subtyping H5 influenza viruses (FLIC-H5). Although the FLIC strip must be scanned using a fluorescent reader, the sensitivity (LOD) is significantly improved over that of conventional IC methods. In addition, the antibodies which are specific against the subtypes of influenza viruses cannot be available for the detection of other subtypes when the major antigenicity will be changed. In this study, we established the use of FLIC to type seasonal influenza A and B viruses (FLIC-AB). This method has improved sensitivity to 100-fold higher than that of conventional IC methods when we used several strains of influenza viruses. In addition, FLIC-AB demonstrated the ability to detect influenza type A and influenza type B viruses from clinical samples with high sensitivity and specificity (Type A: sensitivity 98.7% (74/75), specificity 100% (54/54), Type B: sensitivity 100% (90/90), specificity 98.2% (54/55) in nasal swab samples) in comparison to the results of qRT-PCR. And furthermore, FLIC-AB performs better in the detection of early stage infection (under 13 h) than other conventional IC methods. Our results provide new strategies to prevent the early-stage transmission of influenza viruses in humans during both seasonal outbreaks and pandemics."

The most common species were Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and S. warneri. The majority of such isolates were resistant to penicillin and to either or both of methicillin and gentamicin. During 1993, there was an increase in the number of CoNS bloodstream infections compared with previous years. S. epidermidis was the most common isolate, with 88% assessed as clinically relevant. Using the three typing systems, we identified one likely epidemic clone of S. epidermidis, the isolates of which were resistant to penicillin, gentamicin and erythromycin and possessed the mecA gene. There was complete correlation between the detection of mecA and the phenotypic expression of resistance when zone diameters in the disc diffusion assay were interpreted according to the latest NCCLS guidelines (1999). Profiles of the remaining 1993 isolates were generally heterogeneous, suggesting independent acquisition with some evidence of cross-infection. The predominant bloodstream isolates in 1996 were heterogeneous multi-resistant strains of S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and S. warneri, about half of which were assessed as clinically relevant. These data support the view that CoNS are significant nosocomial pathogens in NICU and that resistant clones may be transmitted between babies. Molecular epidemiological tools are helpful for understanding transmission patterns and sources of infection, and are useful for measuring outcomes of intervention strategies implemented to reduce nosocomial CoNS sepsis. PFGE was found to be more discriminatory than RAPD, but the latter provides results in a more timely manner."

Enteroviruses could be detected in 14 cases of SIDS, whereas the detection of enteroviral nucleic acid within the control group was negative. Seven cases with myocardial infection caused by parvovirus B19 were found in the SIDS group. The detection of parvoviruses in the control group of the 11 children younger than 1 year was negative, whereas 3 positive cases of parvoviruses could be detected in the control group of children from 1 to 10 years old. In the myocardial sample of one SIDS case, both enteroviruses and parvovirus B19 could be detected. Our results emphasize the importance of modern molecular biologic methods in cases of sudden infant death even when conventional histologic examination revealed no serious findings in heart muscle tissue."

The probes employed detect the gene coding EPEC adherence factor (EAF) and the virulence genes for bundle-forming pilus (bfp) and entero-attaching-effacing (eae) factor. Twenty-one isolates hybridised with at least one probe, and 11 of them were classified as typical EPEC because they hybridised with all three probes, showed a pattern of localised adherence (LA) and carried no genes for enterotoxins (ST and LT) or invasion as detected by PCR. Six of the typical EPEC strains belonged to the classical serotype 0119:H6 and one to O111:H6; O antigens could not be determined in four strains with antisera against 01-0173. All typical EPEC strains carried a 70-MDa plasmid plus two other large plasmids. These data showed that typical EPEC virulence traits may be found in strains not belonging to classical serogroups/serotypes and that molecular identification is required for studying the epidemiology of diarrhoea in children."
CD011926,0,8263117,0,Rapid and sensitive method for the detection of B19 virus DNA using the polymerase chain reaction with nested primers.,"The sensitivity of detection of B19 virus DNA in clinical specimens was evaluated by comparing the results of single PCR and nested PCR assays, with or without subsequent Southern blot hybridization to a radiolabelled B19 DNA probe. The inhibitory activity of human serum components on polymerase reaction was also determined. The sensitivity of B19 virus DNA detection decreased by a factor of 10(7) in the presence of 10% serum in the single PCR reaction mixture, and of 10(3) for nested PCR. When nested PCR products were analysed by Southern blot hybridization to a B19 radioactive DNA probe, the sensitivity of the assay increased to such a level of B19 DNA detection that the reaction was no longer influenced by the presence of serum inhibitors in the original sample. Less than ten B19 genome copies could thus be detected in a 10-microliters sample. A panel of 38 clinical samples, originating from patients with possibility of B19 virus infection, were assayed by this method. Only one sample was found to be positive after single PCR, whereas seven samples (including the former) gave a positive signal after nested PCR. The specificity of the nested PCR products was controlled by hybridization to the B19 DNA probe and DNA sequencing. No discrepancy in the results was observed between nested PCR alone and nested PCR followed by Southern blot analysis."

Consensus sequencing of specimens with indeterminate OLA results was performed to identify genetic sequence polymorphisms that appeared to compromise performance of the OLA. When consistent patterns of polymorphisms were observed the probes were redesigned, and DBS specimens with indeterminate OLA results were retested with the new Zimbabwe-specific (ZW) probes. OLA results obtained in Zimbabwe were compared to repeat testing in a US reference laboratory. 188/200 (94%) DBS yielded polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of HIV pol. ZW probes reduced indeterminate OLA results from 5.2% to 2.8% of codons evaluated (p=0.02), with 98.2% concordance between results obtained in the Zimbabwean and US laboratories. Optimization of OLA probes to accommodate polymorphisms in regional HIV variants improved OLA performance, and comparison to the USA results showed successful implementation of the OLA in Zimbabwe for detection of NVP resistance mutations in DBS specimens."
CD011926,0,23397701,0,A large-scale study of respiratory virus infection over 2 years using the Luminex xTAGRVP assay.,"Traditional methods of detecting and identifying respiratory viruses like cell culture and immunofluorescence are labor intensive, often slow, and are dependent on specimen viability. As a result, there has been a shift in laboratory practices from these methods to molecular-based techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, which can be faster, more sensitive, and less labor intensive than traditional methods. The Food and Drug Administration approved version of the Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay detects 12 respiratory viruses simultaneously. We evaluated the performance of the RVP assay, on over 8,000 nasopharyngeal specimens during a 2-year period. Approximately 70% of all specimens tested were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Influenza A (Inf A) was the most prevalent, followed by respiratory syncytial virus. The RVP assay also detected the newly emerging Inf A porcine H1N1 that started to circulate in 2008. However, it could not identify it to subtype level and required further confirmatory tests. This study shows that the RVP assay is an invaluable tool in monitoring seasonal outbreaks and pandemic events. It not only detects newly emerging influenza strains, but also allows the throughput of thousands of clinical specimens in a timely manner, reducing the turnaround time from weeks to days, when compared to cell culture."

We collected 249 stool samples between 1999 and 2001 from children with diarrhoea in three health districts of Botswana and examined them for the presence of rotavirus antigens and particles. Group A rotavirus antigen was detected in 43 of 249 (17%) of the samples tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of the 43 children shedding rotaviruses, 37 (86%) were infants < or =2 years of age. The presence of rotavirus particles was also confirmed by direct electron microscopy. The characteristic 11 segments of the double-stranded RNA mobility pattern of rotavirus were demonstrated by polyacrylamide electrophoresis in 20 of 43 (47%) of the rotavirus-positive samples. The predominant electrophoretic pattern detected was the long (L) electrophoretype 14 of 20 (70%) followed by the short (S) electrophoretype five of 20 (25%). One strain had a mixed (L/S) pattern. Of the 26 samples subjected to subgrouping by enzyme immuno assay, eight were typed as subgroup-II specific and seven were subgroup I. The predominant VP7 genotypes detected were G1 (59%). Two mixed strains of G1 + G3 (5%) and G1 + G2 (5%) were also detected. VP4 genotypes in circulation were: P[4] (5%), P[6] (33%) and P[8] (33%).

CD011926,0,10086088,0,[Parvovirus B19 infection in pregnancy: a cause of non-immune hydrops fetalis].,"Four pregnancies, in two women aged 39 and two women aged 34 years respectively, were complicated by foetal parvovirus B19 infection. First-trimester intrauterine death resulting from multiple congenital anomalies was diagnosed in one patient with proven foetal parvovirus B19 infection. In three patients foetal hydrops was found in the second trimester with variable clinical course. In one of them, foetal hydrops resulted in second-trimester foetal death; in another, foetal hydrops resolved following intrauterine blood transfusion and in a third foetal hydrops resolved spontaneously. Foetal parvovirus B19 infection was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using foetal cells obtained by amnioscentesis. It is concluded that maternal parvovirus B19 infection is mostly asymptomatic. However, the clinical impact of maternal infection on the foetus is diverse, i.e. infection may result in foetal death or--transient--foetal morbidity, in particular foetal anaemia. In mothers with proven foetal parvovirus B19 infection close monitoring of the foetus by ultrasound is warranted. Occasionally intrauterine transfusion is required. From the literature to date, the estimated incidence of maternal parvovirus B19 infection in pregnancy is 3-7%. The vertical transmission rate approximates 30%. When pregnancy is complicated by foetal hydrops foetal parvovirus B19 infection should be kept in mind."
CD011926,0,11523762,0,Postnatal zidovudine in prevention of vertical HIV-1 transmission in a service setting.,"We sought to determine the efficacy of a 4-6 week course of zidovudine (ZDV) in a group of infants exposed to HIV-1. A retrospective chart review was conducted on HIV-1-exposed neonates identified from February 1998 to August 1999. These infants received ZDV and their mothers were counselled regarding the risks and benefits of breastfeeding. After informed consent was obtained, the HIV-1-status of the infant was determined by RNA-PCR after 1 month of age. Thirty-three HIV-1-exposed neonates were identified; seven infants were excluded, five because of insufficient data and two because of maternal ZDV administration. In all but three, the diagnosis was suspected because of maternal illness, 19 of 26 mothers having either stage 3 or 4 disease. The transmission rate was 15.4 per cent (4 of 26). Errors in ZDV administration were detected in 20 neonates of whom four were infected (p = 1; Fischer's exact test). Antenatal diagnosis of HIV-1 status was associated with fewer medication errors in HIV-1-exposed neonates (p = 0.017, Fisher's exact test). It was concluded that a transmission rate of 15.4 per cent in symptomatic mothers suggests efficacy. Under similar circumstances, transmission rates varying between 37 and 67 per cent have been reported. Antenatal diagnosis is significantly associated with compliance to the regimen. Early identification of at-risk neonates and familiarity with the regimen may improve the outcome."

CD011926,0,16764687,0,Low expression of the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha chain and reduced signalling via the IL-4 receptor complex in human neonatal B cells.,"Diminished neonatal antibody responses following infection or immunization may stem in part from intrinsic characteristics of neonatal B cells. In this study, we used B-cell subset sorting combined with gene expression assays to investigate major differences in the expression of host genes in neonatal and adult naïve B cells. We discovered significantly reduced expression of the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha chain and reduced IL-4-induced signalling in neonatal B cells. Neonatal naïve B cells were susceptible to more rapid and more profound levels of apoptosis when cultured in vitro. They also exhibited a limited response to IL-4 treatment compared with adult cells. The expression level of the IL-13 receptor alpha 1 chain, a key component of the IL-13 receptor/IL-4 type II receptor, and the response to IL-13 treatment for protection against apoptosis in neonatal B cells were similar to those of the adult B cells. These studies suggest a possible mechanism underlying the limited magnitude and durability of neonatal antibody responses."

The patients included 67 children aged from 0 to 10 years and 75 adults. All children were positive by PCR on their pre-therapy sample, while only 69% of the seropositive adults and none of the 78 seronegative control adults were PCR positive. Xenodiagnosis was positive in 79% of the children, but only in 21% of the adults. A group of 66 children was treated with nifurtimox, and followed up every 3 months during the first year and every 6 months during the second and third year post-therapy, by PCR, xenodiagnosis and serology. We concluded that PCR was the most effective test to monitor children for 3 years post-chemotherapy, when all the cases converted from positive to negative. Conventional serology, however, remained positive after that period in most cases. In contrast, conversion to negative xenodiagnosis occurred very early after treatment."

CD011926,0,15472338,0,PCR assay using cerebrospinal fluid for diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis in Brazilian AIDS patients.,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy has decreased the incidence of opportunistic infections in the central nervous system in AIDS patients. However, neurological abnormalities still remain important causes of mortality and morbidity in developing countries. In Brazil, cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most common cerebral mass lesion in AIDS patients. For these reasons, early, inexpensive, and sensitive diagnostic tests must be evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate PCR, using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples to detect Toxoplasma gondii DNA, and to determine if the association of PCR with immunological assays can contribute to a timely diagnosis. We studied two sample groups. First, we analyzed stored CSF samples from 29 newborns and from 39 adults with AIDS without a definitive diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. The goal of this step was to standardize the methodology with a simple and economical procedure to recover the T. gondii DNA. Next, we prospectively evaluated CSF samples from 12 AIDS patients with a first episode of cerebral toxoplasmosis and 18 AIDS patients with other neurological opportunistic diseases and without previous cerebral toxoplasmosis. In all PCR samples, an indirect immunofluorescent assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. Samples from all patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis presented positive PCR results (sensitivity, 100%), and a sample from one of the 18 AIDS patients with other neurological diseases also presented positive PCR results (specificity, 94.4%). These findings suggest the clinical utility of PCR in the diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis in developing countries."

The stools of 712 children, negative for rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and reovirus, were examined by PCR or RT-PCR for AstV, BoV, and SaV. The prevalence of AstV, BoV, and SaV in the patients examined was 2.1%, 3.2%, 2.4%, respectively, with the viruses being detected mostly in children <3 years of age. AstV strains were characterized by sequencing as types 1, 2, and 4, with a AstV-1 peak occurring in the 2008 fall-winter season.

CD011926,0,1651584,0,Identification of herpes simplex virus infection by immunoperoxidase and in situ hybridization methods.,"Seven cases of visceral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection were observed in five cases of hematopoietic disease and in one case each of a newborn baby and a pregnant woman. These seven cases were studied with an immunoperoxidase method and in situ hybridization. In HSV lesions of squamous epithelium, the immunoperoxidase method using rabbit anti-human HSV revealed positive staining, mainly in the nucleus but with some cytoplasmic staining. DNA in situ hybridization revealed stronger positive staining in the nucleus. In HSV hepatitis positive staining was seen in the nucleus and cytoplasm, both by immunoperoxidase and in situ hybridization methods. In the newborn baby, HSV lesions were observed in the brain only, with numerous positive astrocytes identified by the immunoperoxidase method and a few positive astrocyte nuclei by in situ hybridization. Cultured human fetal fibroblasts from the lung were infected with HSV. The immunoperoxidase method revealed diffuse positive staining in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm whereas in situ hybridization revealed fibrillar positive staining in the nucleus only. Thus, the immunoperoxidase method using rabbit anti-human HSV can detect the presence of HSV protein more sensitively than in situ hybridization, probably because of the greater quantity of HSV protein compared with HSV DNA in infected cells."

A cost-effectiveness study of 4 strategies using a theoretical model showed that the risk strategy (antibiotics for women at risk) and combination strategy (antibiotics for GBS-positive women at risk) seemed more cost-effective than the current Dutch strategy (antibiotics for women at risk ifGBS positive) and the screening strategy (antibiotics for GBS-positive women).

In response, we developed two real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) gene and evaluated these assays as a panel with a previously published assay targeting the region upstream of the MERS-CoV envelope gene (upE) for the detection and confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. All assays detected ≤10 copies/reaction of quantified RNA transcripts, with a linear dynamic range of 8 log units and 1.3 × 10(-3) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml of cultured MERS-CoV per reaction. All assays performed comparably with respiratory, serum, and stool specimens spiked with cultured virus. No false-positive amplifications were obtained with other human coronaviruses or common respiratory viral pathogens or with 336 diverse clinical specimens from non-MERS-CoV cases; specimens from two confirmed MERS-CoV cases were positive with all assay signatures. In June 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of the rRT-PCR assay panel as an in vitro diagnostic test for MERS-CoV. A kit consisting of the three assay signatures and a positive control was assembled and distributed to public health laboratories in the United States and internationally to support MERS-CoV surveillance and public health responses."

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each isolate was determined using a broth microdilution method, and ESBL production was assayed. The presence of β-lactamase genes, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, and blaTLA-1, was detected by PCR and confirmed with sequencing. Only ESBL-producing isolates were further subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and plasmid profiling. All of the ESBL isolates were multidrug resistant and 75/460 (16.3%) E. coli isolates and 21/78 (26.9%) K. pneumoniae isolates were found to produce ESBL.

Norovirus detection was done by real-time RT-PCR. Genotype was determined using Gel-based and real time RT-PCR methods and sequencing targeting the polymerase and the capsid region respectively. Norovirus was detected in 14.3%, 181/1266 children. The prevalence of norovirus was significantly higher in cases (18.3%, 129/705) than in controls, (9.2%, 52/561), P<0.05. Except for one child who had double infection with GI and GII all 129 cases had GII. Among controls, 23.1% had GI and 76.9% had GII. Norovirus GII.4 was significantly more prevalent in cases 87.9% than in controls 56.5%. Other genotypes detected in both cases and controls were GII.21, GII.16 and GII.g.

CD011926,0,6321362,0,Studies on chemical carcinogen enhancement of Epstein-Barr virus induced transformation of human neonatal and adult peripheral blood lymphocytes.,"The effects of a wide range of selected chemical carcinogens on the frequency of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced transformation have been investigated. The carcinogens tested included direct-acting chemicals and chemicals requiring either activation via reactions with nucleophiles, or cell-mediated enzyme activation. Treatment with some but not all chemicals suspected of being carcinogens resulted in enhanced EBV-induced transformation of neonatal or adult peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The temporal relationship between carcinogen exposure and EBV infection could dramatically influence the results of the chemical carcinogen-cellular interaction as measured by the cells' ability to subsequently undergo morphologic transformation. This relationship was particularly evident when cells were treated with alkylating agents such as dimethylsulfonate (DMS) or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Beginning at 24 h, and at later times following EBV-infection, cellular transformation became more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of DMS and, in contrast, more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of MNNG. These diametrically opposed results clearly demonstrate the ability of EBV infection to alter the response of lymphocytes to chemical carcinogens as measured by transformation. The lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from carcinogen-treated PBLs had increased cloning efficiency. Furthermore, using radiolabelled, molecularly cloned subgenomic fragments of EBV DNA and DNA-DNA hybridization, we have been able to detect an increased number of EBV genome equivalents in whole-cell and high-molecular-weight cellular DNA extracted from LCLs established from MNNG as well as DMS-treated PBLs. We propose that carcinogen enhancement of EBV-induced transformation is an example of a two-step mechanism of oncogenic transformation in primary human lymphoid cells. The possible significance of these findings in relation to potential development of lymphomas following EBV exposure will be discussed."
CD011926,0,16254979,0,G2 rotavirus infections in an infantile population of the South of Italy: variability of viral strains over time.,"Rotavirus positive samples collected in Palermo, Italy, during 2002-2004 did not react with the G2 type-specific RV5:3 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and could be identified as G2 only by RT-PCR genotyping. The genetic variation of VP7 and VP4 antigenic proteins was studied in 14 G2 samples including a selection of both those successfully characterized by serotyping and those failing to be serotyped. The phylogenetic analysis performed on partial VP7 sequences showed a temporal clustering of these strains, with those isolated in Palermo in 2003 belonging to the same lineage of G2 MAbs-unreactive strains identified in UK in 1996-1997 and in Bari, Italy, in 2003-2004. A single amino acid substitution in VP7 antigenic region A, at position 96 (Asp-->Asn), was consistently associated with the loss of antigenic reactivity. Five of the G2 strains were further characterized by sequencing of VP4-encoding genes as belonging to the P[4] type, and separate lineages clustering the strains according to a temporal distribution could be described. VP7 and VP4 antigenic proteins analysis provided evidence that over the last 11 years, at least two different populations of G2P[4] rotavirus strains have been infecting the infant population in Palermo. Considering the role of anti-VP7 and anti-VP4 neutralizing antibodies in rotavirus immunity, the emergence of new VP7-VP4 gene combinations might influence rotavirus circulation in the infant population and should be taken into consideration when devising vaccination strategies."
CD011926,0,15246613,0,Prevalence of HBsAg mutants and impact of hepatitis B infant immunisation in four Pacific Island countries.,"The prevalence rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Pacific Island countries is amongst the highest in the world. Hepatitis B immunisation has been incorporated into national programmes at various times, often with erratic supply and coverage, until a regionally co-ordinated programme, which commenced in 1995 ensured adequate supply. The effectiveness of these programmes was recently evaluated in four countries, Vanuatu and Fiji in Melanesia, Tonga in Polynesia and Kiribati in Micronesia. That evaluation established that the programmes had a substantial beneficial impact in preventing chronic hepatitis B infection [Vaccine 18 (2000) 3059]. Several studies of hepatitis B vaccination programmes in endemic countries have identified the potential significance of surface gene mutants as a cause for failure of immunisation. In the study outlined in this paper, we screened infected children and their mothers for the emergence and prevalence of these variants in specimens collected from the four country evaluation. Although the opportunity for the emergence of HBV vaccine escape mutants in these populations was high due to the presence of a considerable amount of the virus in the population and the selection pressure from vaccine use, there were no ""a"" determinant vaccine escape mutants found. This suggests that vaccine escape variants are not an important cause for failure to prevent HBV transmission in this setting. Other HBsAg variants were detected, but their functional significance remains to be determined. The failure to provide satisfactory protection during such immunisation programmes reflects the need for achieving and sustaining high vaccine coverage, improving the timeliness of doses as well as improving 'cold-chain' support, rather than the selection of vaccine-escape mutants of HBV."

As advanced methods, reagents, and disposal kits for detecting and identifying pathogens become commercially available, it is important to test them in settings other than in laboratories with ""state-of-the-art"" equipment and well-trained staff members. In the present study, we sought to detect microsporidia DNA preserved and extracted from FTA (fast technology analysis) cards spotted with human fecal suspensions obtained from Cameroonian volunteers living in the capital city of Yaoundé to preclude the need for employing spore-concentrating protocols. Further, we tested whether amplicon nucleotide sequencing approaches could be used on small aliquots taken from the cards to elucidate the diversity of microsporidia species and strains infecting native residents. Of 196 samples analyzed, 12 (6.1%) were positive for microsporidia DNA; Enterocytozoon bieneusi (Type IV and KIN-1), Encephalitozoon cuniculi, and Encephalitozoon intestinalis were identified.

The assay is based on restriction analysis of PCR products derived from the polymorphic UL10-UL13 region of the human cytomegalovirus genome. The method was evaluated using clinical samples from 23 subjects comprising 16 breast-feeding mothers and seven bone marrow transplantation recipients. For eight mothers, postnatal virus transmission to their offspring via breast milk was studied. Interestingly, for one mother-infant pair, a double infection with two distinct human cytomegalovirus strains could be demonstrated. Stepwise digestion with different restriction enzymes raised the possibility of detecting different strains almost twofold compared to analysis with only one enzyme. This assay is a practical tool for monitoring human cytomegalovirus transmission in various clinical settings."

Most of these children, although born antibody-positive, lose maternal antibody and remain asymptomatic. However, it has been unclear how many antibody-negative children of HIV-infected women may truly be infected despite the loss of passively acquired maternal antibody. One hundred nine children who lost maternal antibody after birth to HIV-infected women recruited in four United States maternal HIV transmission studies were examined for HIV infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine whether children had HIV proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A total of 268 samples from 109 children were tested. Clinical status and other laboratory findings were also evaluated. The median age at last follow-up was 25 months (range, 12 to 48 months). One hundred seven (98%) children were negative by PCR on all samples tested. None (95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.9%) of 109 children had a repeatedly positive PCR. Two children had single positive PCR results that could not be confirmed on subsequent testing. No other laboratory or clinical findings supported HIV infection in either of these children. The loss of HIV antibody in an asymptomatic child born to an HIV-infected woman strongly suggests that the child is not infected with HIV. Single positive PCR results, particularly in the absence of other clinical or laboratory evidence of HIV infection, should not be used alone to diagnose HIV infection."

CD011926,0,12515431,0,Antenatal inflammation and infection in chronic lung disease of prematurity.,"In spite of improved neonatal care, chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in extremely preterm infants. Our current understanding is that antenatal infection can trigger intra-uterine inflammation which then promotes preterm labour. Recent studies suggest that antenatal infection and inflammation can also increase the preterm infant's susceptibility to develop CLD. It may be that exposure of the fetal lung to high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines is the cause of this increased susceptibility. One candidate for initiating intra-uterine inflammation is ascending infection by the vaginal commensal Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu). Antibiotics administered to mothers prior to delivery appear to improve the neonatal outcome in cases of preterm prolonged rupture of membranes, but not in cases of preterm labour with intact membranes. Uu can be transmitted vertically to the airways of the preterm infant, but the role of Uu in causing CLD remains uncertain. Small trials of antibiotics given to preterm infants after delivery have not shown any consistent benefit in reducing CLD. Although CLD remains a significant problem for the extremely preterm infant, it is likely that molecular biology techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction, will enhance the detection of antenatal infection and further our understanding of the pathogenesis of CLD."
CD011926,0,20089756,0,Predominance and emergence of clones of hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Malaysia.,"We define the epidemiology of predominant and sporadic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in a central teaching and referral hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This is done on the basis of spa sequencing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, and virulence gene profiling. During the period of study, the MRSA prevalence was 44.1%, and 389 MRSA strains were included. The prevalence of MRSA was found to be significantly higher in the patients of Indian ethnicity (P < 0.001). The majority (92.5%) of the isolates belonged to ST-239, spa type t037, and possessed the type III or IIIA SCCmec. The arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) arcA gene was detected in three (1.05%) ST-239 isolates. We report the first identification of ACME arcA gene-positive ST-239. Apart from this predominant clone, six (1.5%) isolates of ST-22, with two related spa types (t032 and t4184) and a singleton (t3213), carrying type IVh SCCmec, were detected for the first time in Asia. A limited number of community-acquired (CA) MRSA strains were also detected. These included ST-188/t189 (2.1%), ST-1/t127 (2.3%), and ST-7/t091 (1%). Panton-Valentin leukocidin (PVL) was detected in all ST-1 and ST-188 strains and in 0.7% of the ST-239 isolates. The majority of the isolates carried agr I, except that ST-1 strains were agr III positive. Virulence genes seg and sei were seen only among ST-22 isolates. In conclusion, current results revealed the predominance of ST-239-SCCmec III/IIIA and the penetration of ST-22 with different virulence gene profiles.

Transfusion transmission of CMV (TT-CMV) to seronegative immunocompromised patients can lead to lethal CMV disease. Studies over the past 30 years have demonstrated that monocytes latently infected with CMV represent the primary vector for TT-CMV, and that TT-CMV can be largely abrogated by transfusing at-risk patients with either seronegative units or blood filtered to remove white blood cells. However, the small number of cases of breakthrough TT-CMV that follow transfusion of either seronegative or filtered blood still produce morbidity and mortality. These circumstances have motivated ongoing efforts to provide improved protection from TT-CMV, including the use of CMV DNA amplification for blood screening, and pathogen inactivation to sterilise all blood components prior to transfusion."

A retrospective cohort study was conducted among pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia treated with vancomycin for >5 days from 1 August 2005 to 31 May 2007 in a large tertiary care center. MRSA bloodstream isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR analysis of virulence genes, and Diversilab typing. Clinical records were reviewed for outcomes and comorbidities. A total of 22 pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia were identified. Eleven cases (50.0%) were considered vancomycin treatment failures. Features significantly associated with vancomycin treatment failure were prematurity (P = 0.02) and isolates positive for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) (P = 0.008). Features typically associated with community-associated MRSA strains were identified in hospital-associated isolates. A dominant clone was not responsible for the high number of treatment failures. Further studies are needed to determine if vancomycin should be the first-line treatment for MRSA bacteremia in premature infants and for PVL-positive isolates."

CD011926,0,26321008,0,Ampicillin resistance of invasive Haemophilus influenzae isolates in Germany 2009-2012.,"In this retrospective study covering a four-year observation period (2009-2012) the prevalence of aminopenicillin resistance of invasive Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) in Germany was analyzed. The main resistance mechanism against aminopenicillins is conferred by β-lactamase production, which can be inhibited by clavulanate or sulbactam. Apart from that, β-lactamase negative ampicillin resistance (BLNAR) has been reported due to mutations in the penicillin-binding protein PBP3. The prevalence of BLNAR varies considerably in different countries. Representative data from Germany have not been reported. We analyzed 704 culture positive cases with bacteraemia or detection of Hi in cerebrospinal fluid; 82 isolates (11.6%) were phenotypically resistant to ampicillin. Among these isolates, 65 (79.3%) showed β-lactamase production, and 17 isolates (20.7%) were phenotypic BLNAR Hi. The proportion of ampicillin resistant isolates remained stable over the observation period. Analysis of the PBP3 sequences of 133 isolates with different susceptibility phenotypes including susceptible, BLNAR, and β-lactamase positive isolates, revealed a high genetic diversity. Previously described PBP3 mutations were associated to elevated MIC values, albeit not exclusively, since few highly susceptible strains were found to be positive for the mutations. Furthermore, since ampicillin susceptible strains with elevated MIC values frequently harboured these mutations, prediction of the resistance phenotype using ftsI sequencing appears to be impossible."

CD011926,0,17123968,0,"Microscopic and sub-microscopic Plasmodium falciparum infection, but not inflammation caused by infection, is associated with low birth weight.","Pregnancy-associated malaria is one of the leading causes of low birth weight in malaria endemic areas. In this study, 145 parturient women residing in areas endemic for Plasmodium falciparum in Lambaréné, Gabon, were recruited into the study after delivery, and the association of maternal P. falciparum infection, inflammatory response, and birth weight was studied. At delivery, 10% (15) of the mothers (12 were positive in both peripheral and placental blood smears, 1 was positive in peripheral blood only, and 2 were positive in placenta blood only) were positive for P. falciparum by microscopy and 23% (30) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly elevated in microscopically P. falciparum-positive pregnant women (34 mg/L; 95% CI: 3-458) but not in those with sub-microscopic infections (6 mg/L; 95% CI: 1-40) compared with those free of P. falciparum infection (7 mg/L; 95% CI: 1-43). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of microscopic (adjusted OR = 28.6, 95% CI = 4.8-169.0) or sub-microscopic (adjusted OR = 13.2, 95% CI = 2.4-73.0) P. falciparum infection in pregnant women and age of mothers < 21 years (adjusted OR = 9.7 CI = 1.0-89.7), but not CRP levels, were independent predictors for low birth weight. This finding may have important operational implications and emphasizes the need for appropriate diagnostic methods in studies evaluating the outcome of pregnancy-associated malaria."

CD011926,0,24610501,0,Association of pregnancy outcome with cytokine gene polymorphisms in HEV infection during pregnancy.,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is associated with high maternal and fetal mortalities. The aim of the study was to find cytokine gene polymorphisms in relation to HEV infection during pregnancy. A total of 262 pregnant and 208 non-pregnant women with hepatitis, 262 healthy pregnant and 208 non-pregnant women as controls. The study group were pregnant and non-pregnant women with HEV infection, not infected with HEV and controls. Genotyping was carried out by PCR-RFLP and ARMS-PCR methods. The frequencies of TNF-α -308 A allele & AA genotype, IFN-γ +874 T allele & TT genotypes were significantly higher in pregnant women with HEV infection compared to other groups. The frequency of TGF-β1 codon 10 +869 T allele &TT genotype and codon 25 +915 G allele & GG genotype were significantly higher in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women with HEV infection. The frequency of IL-6-174 GG genotype was significantly higher in pregnant women with HEV infection compared to not infected with HEV and controls. Cytokine gene polymorphisms shows association with preterm delivery (TNF-α -308 AA, IFN-γ +874 AA, TGF-β1 codon 10 +869 TT & codon 25 GG genotypes), low birth weight (TNF-α -308 GG & IL-6 -174 CC genotypes), fetal loss (IL-6-174 CC genotype), and small for date (IL-6-174 CC & TGF-β1 codon 10 +869 TC genotypes) of HEV infected pregnant women compared to not infected with HEV and controls. These findings suggest that cytokines gene polymorphisms were found to be associated with pregnant women with HEV infection and adverse pregnancy outcome."

All 14 reference serotypes of U. urealyticum were detected with equal sensitivity (1-10 cfu), whereas multiple strains of 12 other mycoplasma species found in humans as well as eukaryotic DNA were not detected. A total of 638 clinical specimens was evaluated. Results indicate that PCR is equal to if not more sensitive than culture for detection of U. urealyticum. Faster detection of U. urealyticum by PCR (< 24 h) compared to culture (2-5 days) will be particularly important in management of very low birth-weight infants in whom this organism has been shown to be a significant cause of meningitis, respiratory disease, and death. This method of detection will also be helpful in further determining the role of this organism in intraamniotic infection and premature birth."

The 39 infants included 12 breast-fed and 27 bottle-fed infants. Particle agglutination (PA) assay and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) test with 467 cells were performed to detect anti-HTLV-I antibody. In breast-fed infants, two (16.7%) cases were both seropositive and PCR-positive and others were both negative, so there was perfect agreement between seropositivity and PCR-positivity. In bottle-fed infants, two (7.4%) cases were seropositive but PCR-negative. This seropositivity was supposed to be due to the transplacental maternal anti-HTLV-I antibody. In 25 seronegative bottle-fed infants, 4 (14.8%) cases were PCR-positive. No significant difference was found in the PCR-positivity rate between the breast-fed and bottle-fed groups. Our study showed the usefulness of the PCR method in identifying VT, the existence of silent carriers especially in bottle-fed infants and the possibility of transplacental or birth canal routes of HTLV-I infection."

Assurance of polio free status is based on enterovirus surveillance, which focuses on patients with signs of acute flaccid paralysis or aseptic meningitis/encephalitis, representing the key symptoms of poliovirus infection. In response to the wild poliovirus outbreak in Syria 2013 and high number of refugees coming from Syria to Germany, stool samples from 629 Syrian refugees/asylum seekers aged <3 years were screened for wild poliovirus between November 2013 and April 2014. Ninety-three samples (14.8%) were positive in an enterovirus specific PCR. Of these, 12 contained Sabin-like polioviruses. The remaining 81 samples were characterized as non-polio enteroviruses representing several members of groups A-C as well as rhinovirus. Wild-type poliovirus was not detected via stool screening involving molecular and virological methods, indicating a very low risk for the importation by Syrian refugees and asylum seekers at that time."
CD011926,0,26321006,0,Molecular typing of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1- and Enterotoxin A-producing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolates from an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit.,"Outbreaks of Staphylococcus aureus are common in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Usually they are documented for methicillin-resistant strains, while reports involving methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains are rare. In this study we report the epidemiological and molecular investigation of an MSSA outbreak in a NICU among preterm neonates. Infection control measures and interventions were commissioned by the Local Public Health Authority and supported by the Robert Koch Institute. To support epidemiological investigations molecular typing was done by spa-typing and Multilocus sequence typing; the relatedness of collected isolates was further elucidated by DNA SmaI-macrorestriction, microarray analysis and bacterial whole genome sequencing. A total of 213 neonates, 123 healthcare workers and 205 neonate parents were analyzed in the period November 2011 to November 2012. The outbreak strain was characterized as a MSSA spa-type t021, able to produce toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and Enterotoxin A. We identified seventeen neonates (of which two died from toxic shock syndrome), four healthcare workers and three parents putatively involved in the outbreak. Whole-genome sequencing permitted to exclude unrelated cases from the outbreak and to discuss the role of healthcare workers as a reservoir of S. aureus on the NICU. Genome comparisons also indicated the presence of the respective clone on the ward months before the first colonized/infected neonates were detected."
CD011926,0,8674964,0,[Initial manifestation of tuberculoid leprosy in pregnancy. Guidelines for diagnosis and therapy].,"Pregnancy has long been associated with the first presentation of clinical leprosy or aggravation of the existing disease. In Germany leprosy has been diagnosed in 107 patients since 1980. A 27-year-old Singhalese female, gravida 2 at 14 weeks' gestation was admitted with well defined, elevated, erythematous lesions on her cheeks and nose. Clinical examination revealed central anaesthesia in the lesions. No further signs of leprosy in the skin, the mucosae and the peripheral nerves were found. Fite-Faraco staining of the skin biopsy showed sporadic acid-fast bacilli and confirmed an active subpolar tuberculoid leprosy (TTs). Outpatient treatment was immediately initiated with oral rifampin 600 mg monthly and dapsone 100 mg daily. During the 4-month treatment cycle the skin lesions vanished completely. Additional leprosy reactions did not occur and the medication was well tolerated. However, in the 32nd gestational week the patient was readmitted with premature labour and 3 weeks later Caesarean section was performed because of cardiotocographic pathology. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. leprae of placental tissue was negative. Antibodies against phenolic glycolipid 1 (PGL 1) of M. leprae (IgM-Elisa and Dot-Elisa) from cord blood, maternal and newborn blood were not found. On the fifth postpartal day the healthy mother and her baby were discharged. In conclusion, leprosy in pregnancy can be treated safely and successfully by combined drug therapy."

This study was performed to detect CHIKV infection, its genotype among symptomatic Eastern Indian patients and to analyze any association between the presence of CHIKV genome in patient body with appearance of disease symptoms (n = 199). Plasma-extracted viral RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and PCR-amplified followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Viral load among CHIKV-positive patients was determined by real time RT-PCR. CHIKV-IgM in sera was detected by ELISA. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of plasma-extracted PCR products was done. CHIKV genome and IgM were detected among 65.3% (n = 130) and 41.2% (n = 82) patients respectively. Joint swelling was significantly associated with CHIKV infection (P-value: 0.0003). CHIKV PCR positive patients were grouped in two categories: Group-I: viral load <10(4)  copies/ml and Group-II: viral load ≥10(4)  copies/ml. Higher number of acute stage patients clustered in Group-II. Fever and joint swelling were significantly more prevalent among Group-II patients, whereas rash and diarrhoea among Group-I patients (P-value <0.05). Patient-isolated CHIKV sequences clustered with CHIKV ECSA genotypes in the phylogenetic tree, with two types of CHIKV strains found to circulate among them-as indicated by their different nucleotide sequences. This is the first study detecting the presence of CHIKV ECSA genotype among Eastern Indian patients. Fever and joint swelling might have appeared first followed by rash, diarrhea during disease progression-as indicated by CHIK viral load in patients. Thus, viral load can be used as unique diagnostic and prognostic marker of Chikungunya disease pathogenesis."

CD011926,0,15232783,0,The detection of Helicobacter pylori in paraffin sections using the PCR technique and various primers as compared to histological techniques.,"Helicobacter pylori is thought to represent a significant etiopathogenic factor in diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract. It seems, therefore, important to elaborate effective techniques for its detection. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori detection using the PCR technique on paraffin sections with various pairs of primers and to compare the results with those of a histological appraisal. Material for the studies involved 50 paraffin blocks with gastric mucosa biopsies fixed in 4% buffered formalin. In this material 4 tests were performed with the aim of diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection: 1) H+E staining, 2) staining by the Giemsa technique, 3) an immunocytochemical technique with antibodies against H. pylori and 4) the PCR technique with various primers. In the present study the most reliable results for H. pylori detection as well as the most pronounced correlation were obtained by using the PCR technique with primers for the ureC gene, immunohistochemistry and staining according to Giemsa. Less compatible results were obtained employing the two PCR techniques which utilise various primers. The experiments confirmed the usefulness of the PCR technique in the detection of Helicobacter pylori in paraffin sections by using a suitable pair of primers, and also indicated that Giemsa staining and immunohistochemistry should be taken into account."

Maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell-associated blood HIV-1 DNA load, and cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) HIV-1 DNA load were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The overall rate of transmission among these mother-infant pairs was 35.7%. Median infant age was 2.5 months. An association between increased plasma HIV-1 RNA load and perinatal transmission was observed (odds ratio [OR], 2.20/1-log virus load; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.18). However, the association between increased blood HIV-1 DNA load and perinatal transmission was stronger (OR, 10.30; 95% CI, 2.11-50.38).

CD011926,0,24615599,0,Cytomegalovirus glycoprotein H genotype distribution and the relationship with hearing loss in children.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a leading cause of congenital infection and a leading infectious cause of hearing loss in children. The ORF UL75 gene encodes envelope glycoprotein H (gH), which is essential for CMV entry into host cells and the target of the immune response in humans. However, the distribution of gH variants and the relationship between the viral genotype, viral load, and sequelae in children infected with CMV is debated. The UL75 genetic variation of CMV isolates from 42 newborns infected congenitally with CMV and 93 infants with postnatal or unproven congenital CMV infection was analyzed. Genotyping was performed by analysis of PCR-amplified fragments, and the viral load was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. There were no differences in the distribution of gH genotypes in the children infected congenitally and postnatally. Mixed-genotype infections with both gH1 and gH2 variants were detected in approximately 25% of the examined patients. No relationship between UL75 gene polymorphisms and the symptoms at birth was observed. The results suggest that the infection with gH2 genotype diminishes the risk of hearing loss in children (P = 0.010). In addition, sensorineural hearing loss was associated with CMV gH1 genotype infection in infants (P = 0.032) and a high viral load in urine (P = 0.005). In conclusion, it was found that the gH genotype does not predict clinical sequelae in newborn infants following congenital CMV infection. However, these results suggest that the gH genotype might be associated with hearing loss in children."
CD011926,0,10462641,0,An outbreak due to echovirus type 30 in a neonatal unit in France in 1997: usefulness of PCR diagnosis.,"Between February and August 1997, 53 patients with enterovirus meningitis were hospitalized in Clermont-Ferrand, France. All but one were children. Echovirus type 30 was involved in 70% of cases with identified serotype. The outbreak ceased on August 8. Two months later, a neonate was admitted to the neonatal unit with an echovirus type 30 meningitis thought to be acquired at delivery. Twenty days later a nosocomial outbreak of echovirus type 30 involving five neonates occurred. Two of them presented with meningitis and two with febrile seizure; One was asymptomatic. The retrospective examination of the maternal sera in a neutralization test, using the index case strain as a source of antigen, showed that none of the neonates was passively immunized before hospitalization. The use of genome detection in cerebrospinal fluid allowed rapid diagnosis and infection was contained by re-inforcing hygiene measures. Prospective examination of stools in the neonatal and paediatric units showed no further occurrences of the disease. No sporadic case was observed in the general population. Hence, nosocomial infections can occur a long time after an outbreak in the general population; rapid diagnosis with molecular tools is useful both for a definite diagnosis in patients already hospitalized, and to act as a rapid alert, even in intervals between seasonal outbreaks."

Interferons (IFNs) inhibit the replication of viruses by acting at various stages of the life cycle and may play a role in protecting against vertical transmission of HIV-1. In addition the beta-chemokines RANTES (regulated on activation T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta can block HIV-1 entry into cells by preventing the binding of the macrophage-trophic HIV-1 strains to the coreceptor CCR5.

In situ mRNA and immunostains.,"The surfactant protein secretory cells in airway and alveolar epithelium were studied in premature baboons with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and superimposed infection. PRN animals were delivered by hysterotomy at 140 d gestational age and ventilated on clinically appropriate oxygen for a 16-d experimental period. To assess 0 time and sacrifice time gestational parameters, 140 and 156 d were studied. BPD animals were delivered at 140 d and ventilated with positive-pressure ventilation and an FIO2 of 1.0 for 11 d followed by 5 d of oxygen sufficient to maintain PAO2 at 40 to 50 mm Hg. BPD-infected animals were comparably ventilated and treated like the BPD group except that 10(8) E. coli organisms were endotracheally instilled on Day 11. In situ hybridization studies for mRNA expression of SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C revealed that an SP-A mRNA deficiency, present at 140 d, persisted in the BPD and BPD-infected groups, whereas SP-A mRNA was abundant in PRN and 156 d gestation control groups. SP-B and SP-C mRNA expression in the two hyperoxically injured groups was particularly extensive in cells around peribronchiolar and perivasicular sites. Immunostaining with SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C antibodies showed variable staining patterns. The study clearly demonstrates that a deficiency of SP-A mRNA expression persists in chronic lung injury and that variable protein staining patterns are manifested depending upon the underlying pathology."

The studies were performed on paraffin sections of organs (liver, pancreas, spleen, lungs) obtained upon autopsy from a child deceased due to acute inborn HCMV infection, on paraffin sections of liver biopsy, obtained from a child with HCMV-induced chronic hepatitis, and of liver biopsies obtained from children with chronic type B hepatitis (n = 13). The classical in situ hybridization was applied with digoxygenin-labeled probes and amplification by the ImmunoMax technique. In HCMV infection, the most pronounced expression of mRNA for TNF-alpha and Il-1alpha was detected in pancreatic islets (mainly in beta cells) and, then, in a decreasing sequence, in liver (in macrophages and sinusoidal endothelial cells) and in lungs (in alveolar macrophages). No expression of the two cytokines was detected in the spleen. In HBV infection, weak expression of TNF-alpha and more intense expression of IL-1alpha in the liver were observed, mainly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and in macrophages as well as in hepatocytes. These results were confirmed by immunocytochemical experiments."

Patients seen for influenza-like illness by general practitioners in a sentinel surveillance network during 2010 were tested for influenza; vaccination status was recorded. Case-patients had positive PCRs for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, and controls had negative influenza test results. Of 319 eligible patients, test results for 139 (44%) were pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus positive. Adjusted effectiveness of seasonal vaccine against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was 79% (95% confidence interval 33%-93%); effectiveness of monovalent vaccine was 47% and not statistically significant. Vaccine effectiveness was higher among adults. Despite some limitations, this study indicates that the first seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine to include the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus strain provided significant protection against laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection."

Using the two peptide-based EIA methods as for screening, HHV-8-specific antibodies were detected in five (12%) patients between days 21 and 91, although only one (2%) subject was positive for HHV-8-specific antibodies before transplantation. All positive results from these five patients were confirmed by at least one of the IFAs, with an additional patient showing seropositivity before transplantation. However, the commercial EIA was negative at all time points (days -7, 21, and 91) in those five patients. The episodes of seroconversion or reactivation were not associated with sustained viremia, since HHV-8 DNA was not detected by real-time PCR in the corresponding leukocytes and plasma of the seropositive patients. No clinical or laboratory abnormalities were clearly associated with HHV-8 seropositivity. This study confirms the utility of simple peptide-based EIA methods to assess the presence of HHV-8-specific antibodies in immunocompromised patients and emphasizes the need of conducting prospective studies to determine the source of HHV-8 infection in SCT recipients."

Over 1 year, 1980 blood samples were collected from suspected cases of dengue fever and analyzed by rapid diagnostic test (RDT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to detect dengue infection. RDT and microscopic methods were used to detect malaria. Of the 1980 samples, only 22 (3.0%) cases were identified as dengue-malaria co-infection cases, out of which 13 were male and 9 were female. The highest number of confirmed cases were found during the hot and humid months of September and October (7 cases, 31.8%) and within the over 15 years age group. Of the cases of co-infection, dengue primary infection (21 cases, 95.5%) was significantly more common than dengue secondary infection (1 case, 4.5%) among all of the age groups. There were 12 cases of Plasmodium falciparum and 10 cases of Plasmodium vivax infection among malarial cases. A high prevalence of concurrence of dengue and malaria infection was recorded in this ecosystem. In light of the severity of co-infection and overlapping symptoms, a multidimensional diagnostic approach is suggested."

CD011926,0,1987348,0,Limitations in the laboratory diagnosis of vertically acquired HIV infection.,"At present, the only well-standardized and widely available diagnostic techniques for HIV infection are detection of IgG HIV antibodies and HIV antigen. The antibody detection is sensitive, but is useful only in infants and children older than 15 months because of the presence of maternal antibodies. The utility of HIV antigen testing in neonates and young infants has not been established. A number of sensitive techniques, such as PCR, ELISPOT, and detection of HIV-specific IgM and IgA antibodies, are under development and promise to be very useful in the early diagnosis of vertical HIV infection. However, we will be able to accurately establish the sensitivity or specificity of the individual tests only when we have results of large prospective studies. These studies should compare different diagnostic methods and correlate the results of tests performed sequentially in neonates and young infants with the natural history of their disease process and eventual clinical outcome."

Specimens were obtained shortly after birth and sequentially up until extubation. One hundred fifty-two specimens (93.8%) contained material suitable for analysis. Ureaplasma spp. were identified in 5 of 13 neonates studied. In most cases, the DNA load of the detected Ureaplasma species was low and decreased over time. In addition, changes in detectable Ureaplasma species DNA did not relate to changes in the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) or respiratory status. All but two blood samples obtained at times of suspected sepsis were culture positive for other microorganisms; the species cultured were typically coagulase-negative staphylococci and were associated with increased levels of CRP (>10 mg/liter). This study was limited by the small number of patients examined and does not have the power to support or contradict the hypothesis that postnatal lung infection with Ureaplasma parvum is causally related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or adverse respiratory outcomes after preterm birth. However, in this study, increases in CRP levels were not associated with patients in whom Ureaplasma parvum was detected, in contrast to the detection of other bacterial species."

CD011926,0,8108846,0,Diarrhoeal disease: current concepts and future challenges. Molecular biological approaches to the epidemiology of diarrhoeal diseases in developing countries.,"Diarrhoea in developing countries is caused by an increasingly long list of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens with rotavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Salmonella heading the list. Using methods to detect most of the known enteropathogens, one or more enteropathogen(s) is isolated in two-thirds of diarrhoeal illnesses in the developing world. Many of these enteropathogens are also frequently isolated from children without diarrhoea. An aetiologic agent is more frequently isolated from cases of invasive diarrhoea than from those with secretory diarrhoea. Deoxyribonucleic acid probes have proved very useful in detecting pathogens such as enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), but have not yet proved to be particularly rapid or less expensive. Molecular biology has proved useful in epidemiological studies as a means of strain identification. Plasmids were initially used as convenient markers and proved useful in identifying epidemic strains of bacteria. Other molecular markers, such as ribotyping, are accurate enough to be used as taxonomic tools."

EVs were isolated from six out of 37 (16.2%) cultured specimens, while 20 out of 52 (38.4%) specimens yielded positive results when 5'non-coding region (5'NCR) RT-PCR assay was used. One specimen that was culture-positive was RT-PCR-negative. Using the VP1-2A RT-PCR and sequence analysis, 14 of the 21 positive EVs were identified as: four strains of Coxsackie virus B5, five echovirus 11, two echovirus 9, one echovirus 5, one echovirus 14, and one Coxsackie virus A9. Fever, headache, vomiting, and stiff neck were the most pronounced symptoms. Pleocytosis with the predominance of lymphocytes and mild elevated protein levels characterized the CSF specimens. Coxsackie virus B5 and echovirus 11 were the predominant serotypes during the study period. Although there was seasonal enteroviral activity (April-November), cases also occurred in the cold months.

CD011926,0,20827780,0,Comparison of viral load and duration of virus shedding in symptomatic and asymptomatic neonatal rotavirus infections.,"A single rotavirus strain causing asymptomatic infections as well as severe gastrointestinal disease has been described in the neonatal nurseries of the Christian Medical College, Vellore. In this study, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to determine the association of viral load with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in neonates. Viral load was estimated in terms of the crossing point [C(t) value] at which the amplicon could be detected in the real-time PCR assay. The study was carried out on 103 neonates, including 33 asymptomatic neonates and 70 neonates with different gastrointestinal symptoms. The duration of virus shedding was also compared between five symptomatic and four asymptomatic neonates using real-time RT-PCR. There was no significant difference in viral load between symptomatic and asymptomatic neonates (P = 0.087). Among neonates with different gastrointestinal symptoms, those presenting with feed intolerance and abdominal distension had a significantly higher viral load than those with other gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.02). For the study on virus shedding, nine neonates were followed up for a median duration of 53 days, with a median of 31 samples tested per child. Extended shedding of low copies of rotavirus was found, with no significant differences in pattern of shedding between symptomatic and asymptomatic neonates. The lack of correlation between viral load and gastrointestinal disease demonstrates yet another difference between neonatal rotavirus infection and infection in older children where higher viral load correlates with severe disease."

Numerous studies have shown the association between HEV infections and type 1 diabetes. Here, the prevalence of HEV infections was studied in healthy Swedish children with increased HLA-associated risk for type 1 diabetes participating in the PRODIA pilot study in which children were randomized to receive probiotics or placebo during the first 6 months of life. Stool specimens collected from 197 children in every 3 months from the age of 3 to 24 months were screened for HEV using traditional viral culturing method and identified with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing of the partial VP1 coding part of the viral genome. Altogether 4.8% (52/1,094) of the specimens were HEV-positive and 22.3% (44/197) of the children excreted HEV during the follow-up. HEV-A and HEV-B were present in 2.1 and 2.7% of the specimens, respectively. HEV-C and HEV-D viruses were not detected. In total, 17 different HEV serotypes were detected and the most common findings were CV-A9 (13.5%), CV-A16 (11.5%), and CV-A2 (9.6%). The majority of the infections (92.3%) were during the enterovirus season extending from July to December. Probiotic treatment did not affect significantly the risk of HEV infections during the 2-year follow-up although a trend for transient decrease for HEV positivity (HEV-A and/or HEV-B) by the age of 12 months was observed in children who received probiotics [OR 0.40; 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 1.08; P-value 0.071, generalized estimating (GEE) analysis]. According to the results, HEV-A findings were nearly as common as HEV-B findings among the healthy children participating in this study. Also it was shown that serotypes belonging to HEV-A species can be detected by means of viral culturing."

Among 60 FHD patients from 27 families with two or more cases per family, we tested available paraffinized tumor tissues from 46 cases by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER1) expression. Thirteen of 46 FHD patients (28%) had EBER1 expressed in the Reed-Sternberg cells. Concordance rate of EBV positivity was evaluated among 34 first-degree related pairs from 17 families for which both cases had available paraffinized tumor tissues. Only two of 17 pairs were concordant for EBER1 positivity. There was no excess of positive concordance (P = .18). Serologically, FHD patients had higher geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) to the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen D (EA-D). There was no difference in seroprevalence between patients and control groups, nor was there concordance in elevated serology among 15 pairs of first-degree related FHD cases. Young adult unaffected family members (UFM) may not react to EBV in the same way as the general population as evidenced by the lower titer of VCA, although not statistically significant, and significantly lower titers of EA-D, compared with age-matched controls. While EBV might have some role in a subset of HD, lack of concordance of EBER1 expression and EBV serology among the FHD cases in the same family suggest that EBV does not play an important role in FHD."

Case report].,"In the 24th week of gestation we diagnosed a severe hydrops fetalis in a 25 year old VI gravid III para, who had contact to parvovirus B19 in the 14th week of gestation. Because of the severe anaemia of the fetus and the massively increased bilirubinoides in the amniotic fluid we decided at the same day to apply the first of four intrauterine transfusions. The serological patterns of maternal blood with highly positive parvovirus-B19-IgG and negative IgM suggested that an infection had occurred. Parvoviral DNA was found in maternal and fetal blood confirming the diagnosis of an acute intrauterine parvovirus-B19 infection. No viral DNA was detected in fetal ascites. IgM in fetal blood was negative. By means of four transfusions, the pregnancy could be prolonged until the 32 + 5th week of gestation while the ascites was declining. When rupture of membranes occurred, a cesarean section had to be performed due to contractions and presentation of the feet. The newborn's blood count exhibited a thrombocytopenia with normal haemoglobin and haematocrit. Five days after delivery, a blood exchange had to be done because of a hyperbilirubinaemia. After seven weeks, the child could be dismissed from hospital in good general status, with decreasing ascites, normal liver function and normal neurological status. The blood of the newborn was tested to be positive for IgG, while IgM-antibodies and parvovirus-B19-DNA were negative. The diagnosis of a parvovirus-B19 infection of a fetus with severe hydrops and anaemia could be verified by a positive proof for DNA in maternal blood, with negative IgM and highly positive parvovirus-B19-IgG and on the other hand highly positive viral DNA in fetal blood and in the amniotic fluid. 10 weeks after contact to parvovirus B19, i. e. in the 24th week of gestation, positive IgG- and negative IgM-antibodies were found in the mother's blood, whereas fetal complications were noticed. These data demonstrate that following an acute parvovirus-B19-infection of the mother IgM-antibodies can be proofed for 6 - 8 (- 10) weeks. On the other side parvovirus-B19-DNA in the mothers blood is detectable by means of PCR for 8 - 10 weeks and in some cases even more than 15 weeks."

Of the 4680 isolated colonies, 758 exhibited resistance to low pH and tolerance to high concentrations of bile salts; of these, only forty-two exhibited a strong ability to adhere to enterocytes in vitro. The identities of the isolates were confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing, which permitted the grouping of the forty-two bacteria into three different strains that showed more than 99 % sequence identity with Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium breve, respectively. The strain identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer regions. Strains were assayed for enzymatic activity and carbohydrate utilisation, and they were deposited in the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganismes (CNCM) of the Institute Pasteur and named L. paracasei CNCM I-4034, B. breve CNCM I-4035 and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036. The strains were susceptible to antibiotics and did not produce undesirable metabolites, and their safety was assessed by acute ingestion in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed BALB/c mouse models. The three novel strains inhibited in vitro the meningitis aetiological agent Listeria monocytogenes and human rotavirus infections. B. breve CNCM I-4035 led to a higher IgA concentration in faeces and plasma of mice. Overall, these results suggest that L. paracasei CNCM I-4034, B. breve CNCM I-4035 and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036 should be considered as probiotic strains, and their human health benefits should be further evaluated."
CD011926,0,10524796,0,Prevalence of maternal cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody and detection of CMV DNA in amniotic fluid.,"The prevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG antibody was determined in 573 pregnant women in the first trimester. The overall prevalence of CMV IgG antibody was 77.5%. The rate of seropositivity was 67.7% in women < 25 yr, and increased with age to 85.7% in women 40 yr. These results imply that young women in Japan are at increased risk for primary CMV infection during pregnancy and that congenital CMV infection rates might increase in the future. We conducted a prospective study of 75 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis for various indications to determine if CMV DNA could be detected in the amniotic fluid. None had symptoms associated with CMV infection, CMV IgM antibody, or seroconversion to CMV IgG antibody during pregnancy. CMV DNA was not detected in the amniotic fluid using a polymerase chain reaction assay. The 65 fetuses, including 3 sets of twins, were followed through birth. CMV DNA was not detected in urine samples obtained within the first 2 weeks of life. In conclusion, CMV DNA was not detected in the amniotic fluid of women who did not have CMV infection. These results, however, suggest that the negative predictive value of prenatal amniotic fluid analysis is high and that the presence of CMV DNA in the amniotic fluid has clinical significance for the diagnosis of congenital CMV infection if detected in pregnant women."

We here report an infant who developed auditory neuropathy after a postnatally acquired CMV infection. Infection probably occurred through ingestion of infected breast milk. Following a cochlear implant, there is normal language perception and a mildly delayed language expression at age 4. We speculate that the long-term effects of perinatal CMV infections are more dependent on the postconceptional age at which infection occurs than on whether the infection occurs antenatally or postnatally. An early acquired neonatal CMV infection in very preterm infants may therefore have long-term neurological sequelae, including auditory deficits."

Ten distinct GECM-10 types were detected among 50 isolates, correlating with the types defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), which is recognized to be the 'gold-standard' method for clinical epidemiological analyses. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), multiplex PCR genotyping of bla CTX-M, bla TEM, bla OXA and bla SHV genes and antibiotic resistance profiling, as well as a PCR assay specific for detecting isolates of the pandemic O25b-ST131 strain, further characterized the outbreak isolates. Two clusters of isolates with distinct GECM-10 types (G06-04 and G07-02), corresponding to two major PFGE types and the MLST-based sequence types (STs) 131 and 1444, respectively, were confirmed to be responsible for the outbreak. The application of GECM-10 sub-typing provided reliable, rapid and cost-effective epidemiological characterizations of the ESBL-producing isolates from a nosocomial outbreak that correlated with and may be used to replace the laborious PFGE protocol for analyzing generic E. coli."

CD011926,0,22152648,0,"Dengue: a newly emerging viral infection in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India.","Prior to 2009 dengue fever had not been reported in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. In 2009, a few patients with dengue fever-like illness were reported, some of whom tested positive for dengue antibodies. In 2010, 516 suspected cases were reported, including some with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS); 80 (15·5%) were positive for dengue antibodies. DENV RNA was detected in five patients and PCR-based typing showed that three of these belonged to serotype 1 and two to serotype 2. This was confirmed by sequence typing. Two clones of dengue virus, one belonging to serotype 1 and the other to serotype 2 appeared to be circulating in Andaman. Emergence of severe diseases such as DHF and DSS might be due to recent introduction of a more virulent strain or because of the enhancing effect of sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies developed due to prior infections. There is a need to revise the vector-borne disease surveillance system in the islands."
CD011926,0,16061366,0,[Herpetic neonatal hepatitis].,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can affect various organs-systems in the neonatal period. Herpetic hepatitis was seldom reported in the literature. We report on 2 cases. Firstly, a 16 day-old newborn infant was admitted because of haemorrhagic syndrome and shock. Biological assessment showed a severe hepatic insufficiency. Antibiotic and aciclovir therapy was started as HSV infection was suspected. Five days later, the herpetic attack was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The genotye of the virus in the CSF was HSV1. Treatment included aciclovir for 21 days intravenously and 2 months orally. At 10 months, the clinical and biological examinations were normal. Secondly, a 4 day-old newborn was hospitalised because of fever and polypnea. Pulmonary X rays showed heterogeneous opacities of the right base. Serum C reactive protein was 30 mg/l. Antibiotic therapy was started. Two days later, the fever persisted while a severe hepatic insufficiency developed. The diagnosis of herpetic hepatitis was evoked and the child was given aciclovir. Forty-eight hours later, the PCR confirmed a HSV in blood, while viral culture of a mouth swab found HSV 2. Evolution was favourable after 21 days of specific and symptomatic treatment. Aciclovir treatment was continued orally for six months. Herpetic hepatitis is rare in the neonatal period. Diagnosis must be evoked early when facing severe neonatal hepatic insufficiency. Provided specific treatment, prognosis is good."
CD011926,0,8567879,0,Recombinant mono- and polyantigens to detect cytomegalovirus-specific immunoglobulin M in human sera by enzyme immunoassay.,"Serological detection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-specific antibody varies greatly because of antigen composition and the lack of antigen standardization. Antigenic materials composed of single well-characterized viral proteins or portions of them, produced via molecular biology, have proven to be promising tools in improving serodiagnosis. We constructed a recombinant protein containing two regions of ppUL32 (p150) and half of ppUL44 (p52) and compared the immunoglobulin M (IgM) reactivity of this triple-antigen fusion protein with that of a double-antigen fusion protein containing the two ppUL32 fragments and that of a monoantigen fusion protein containing half of ppUL44. We also constructed and tested two other monoantigen fusion proteins containing a large fraction of ppUL80a and a fraction of ppUL83. More than 700 serum samples from different groups of immunocompetent and immunosuppressed subjects were tested for the presence of HCMV IgM by recombinant enzyme immunoassay (rec-EIA) and by a commercially available EIA. Western blotting (immunoblotting) and (in the case of immunosuppressed individuals) antigenemia tests by immunofluorescence and PCR of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were also carried out. The results obtained demonstrate that (i) the triple-antigen fusion protein can replace the individual proteins; (ii) the triple-antigen fusion protein cannot be used alone to replace the virus or infected cells in the serological detection of anti-CMV IgM; (iii) the addition of the fusion proteins containing portions of ppUL83 and ppUL80a is essential for the formation of an antigenic mixture that can replace the virus for the search of HCMV-specific IgM; (iv) rec-EIA is very specific and is more sensitive than the commercially available EIA, and the results obtained are consistent with those obtained by Western blotting; and (v) rec-EIA can reliably be used to detect HCMV-specific IgM in different groups of patients with active HCMV infection."

Antenatal screening bloods, TORCH/parvovirus tests and karyotype were unremarkable. Postnatally, he had normal microarray comparative genomic hybridization and serum B12/folate levels, and human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction and antoimmune screening were negative. Targeted gene testing for Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) revealed the pathognomic mutation (c.183_184delTAinsCT). His postnatal clinical course was complicated by: (i) Ventilator dependency because of a combination of a pathologically compliant chest wall and preterm-associated chronic lung disease. (ii) Progressive bone marrow failure, resulting in transfusion dependence and profound neutropenia associated with recurrent sepsis. (iii) Gastrointestinal failure and TPN dependency. (iv) Poor postnatal growth with weight/length/head circumference all <3rd centile. (v) Prognostication was complicated by the lack of published literature on the presentation of SDS in a preterm infant. However, because of inexorable progression of multiorgan failure, intensive care was withdrawn on day 54 of life. SDS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by haematological abnormalities, skeletal dysplasia and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Neonatal presentation is thought to be extremely rare. However, with the availability of genetic testing, it has now become clear that because of overlap in clinical presentation, term-born infants with skeletal dysplasia and severe respiratory distress may initially be misdiagnosed as asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy. This case report highlights the complexities of preterm birth complicating clinical manifestations of SDS."

IHPS is known to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but its precise causes and pathophysiology are poorly understood. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of the principal viruses targeting the respiratory and digestive tracts in children with IHPS. Nasopharyngeal fluids, stools, vomit, and surgical pyloric muscle fragments and swabs were tested by cell culture, viral antigen assay and PCR. IHPS was diagnosed in 23 boys and 8 girls with a mean (± SD) age of 42 ± 15 days (range 20-88 days). There was no seasonal pattern of diagnosis. Twenty-two children (71%) lost weight (mean 246 ± 164 g, range 30-600 g) after the onset of vomiting, and five (16.1%) were dehydrated. Seven (22.6%) infants had been exposed to an infectious contact within 15 days before admission, and one on the day of admission (3.2%). Ear, nose and throat samples and pyloric muscle specimens were negative for all the viruses tested. An adenovirus type 3 was recovered from one stool sample, and RT-PCR was positive for an enterovirus on one vomit sample.

CD011926,0,19040473,0,Molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from bacteraemic patients.,"In order to study the clonality of clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strains and their staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements, 60 isolates of MRSE from bacteraemic patients in three units of the Helsinki University Hospital, Finland were selected, covering the periods 1990-1993 and 1997-1998. The MRSE strains were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing and SCCmec typing. Eleven PFGE types (FIN-SE-1-11) with sequence type ST2 (clonal complex 2; CC2) were identified. The previously established methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus SCCmec criteria were applied to name the MRSE SCCmec complexes, and it was found that 7% of the isolates carried SCCmec type IA (ccrA1, class B), whereas the majority (93%) yielded six non-typeable SCCmec PCR patterns (P1-P6). Within each SCCmec PCR pattern, two ccr recombinase genes (ccrA2 and ccrA3) and two mec gene complexes (class A and class B) were detected. In addition, the ccrC gene was associated with three of the six patterns. In conclusion, the MRSE strains were genetically related to each other (ST2) but their SCCmec complexes were unique combinations of elements previously recognized among SCCmec types III and IV."

We aimed to evaluate a PCR-based rapid diagnosis of methicillin resistance (GeneXpert MRSA) after early detection of S. aureus bacteraemia using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Patients with a first episode of S. aureus bacteraemia identified using MALDI-TOF MS were randomized in a prospective interventional open study between October 2010 and August 2012. In the control group, antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed after MALDI-TOF MS identification on blood culture pellets. In the intervention group, a GeneXpert MRSA was performed after S. aureus identification. The primary outcome was the performance of GeneXpert MRSA directly on blood cultures. We then assessed the impact of early diagnosis of methicillin resistance on the empirical treatment. In all, 197 episodes of S. aureus bacteraemia were included in the study, of which 106 were included in the intervention group. Median time from MALDI-TOF MS identification to GeneXpert MRSA result was 97 min (range 25-250). Detection of methicillin resistance using GeneXpert MRSA had a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 100%. There was less unnecessary coverage of MRSA in the intervention group (17.1% versus 29.2%, p 0.09). GeneXpert MRSA was highly reliable in diagnosing methicillin resistance when performed directly on positive blood cultures. This could help to avoid unnecessary prescriptions of anti-MRSA agents and promote the introduction of earlier adequate coverage in unsuspected cases."

We aimed to assess the risk factors for SBI in febrile infants. Data were obtained from 221 infants younger than three months who visited a single community referral hospital for fever and underwent a complete sepsis workup between August 2003 and July 2006. The causes of fever were febrile illness without a documented cause (FISDC, 65%), urinary tract infection (UTI, 12%), aseptic meningitis (12%), bacteremia (4%), bacterial meningitis (2%). Cerebrospinal fluid enterovirus polymerase chain reaction was positive in 28% of FISDC and 48% of aseptic meningitis cases. When UTI was excluded, the risk factors for SBI were 1) C-reactive protein (CRP) level of > or =1.87 mg/dL and 2) fevers of > or =38.9 degrees C. The specificity and negative predictive values of risk factors 1) and 2) for the diagnosis of SBI were 94% and 95%, respectively. We concluded that enteroviral infection may be a major cause of febrile episodes in infants younger than three months. If UTI could be excluded, the presence of CRP levels > or =1.87 mg/dL and fevers of > or =38.9 degrees C can be used as criteria to rule out SBI in these infants."

This hypothesis remains controversial. We sought to determine whether endotracheal colonization with Ureaplasma sp., adenovirus, or Chlamydia sp. increases the risk of BPD. Intubated VLBW infants were included. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was used to detect Ureaplasma sp., adenovirus, and Chlamydia sp. The outcome measure was BPD or death due to lung disease. Detection of microorganisms was compared between subjects with and without BPD. Logistic regression was used to control for covariates. Of 139 subjects, 33 (25%) screened positive for Ureaplasma sp., 22 of 136 (16%) were positive for adenovirus; eight of 133 (6%) were positive for Chlamydia sp. At 36 wk postmenstrual age, 14 patients had died, 68 (57%) had BPD. Detection of Ureaplasma sp. was associated with BPD or death (p < 0.001); adenovirus (p = 0.52) and Chlamydia sp. (p = 0.33) were not. Controlling confounding factors, the odds ratio for Ureaplasma sp. and BPD or death was 4.2 (95% CI 1.03, 17). In our population, detection of Ureaplasma sp., but not adenovirus or Chlamydia sp. was associated with BPD or death due to lung disease."

CD011926,0,23445132,0,Early prophylactic treatment in pregnant women during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic: obstetric and neonatal outcomes.,"The aim of the study was to estimate the risk factors associated with the 2009 H1N1 influenza infection, during pregnancy; to describe complications and obstetric and perinatal outcomes of pregnancies during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009; to identify if there is teratogenicity at birth after antiviral treatment. Medical records of 168 pregnant women treated in Reina Sofia University Hospital (Cordoba, Spain) for suspected influenza A H1N1 from September 2009 to February 2010 were analysed. Using the PCR test, 76 pregnant women were diagnosed with H1N1 + infection, and infection was ruled out in the remaining 92. To manage the pandemic, recommendations of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention were followed. Results showed that the majority of pregnant women were attended at the hospital between October and December 2009 (91.27%). Most of them were in the third-quarter of pregnancy (42.9%). In our sample, being aged between 29 and 37 years reduces the risk of acquiring infection (odds ratio, OR 0.379, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.188-0.763). However, in pregnant women who have required hospitalisation, the risk of infection increased five-fold (OR = 4.999; 95% CI = 1.178-21.212). No differences were found between obstetric and perinatal outcomes of both affected and unaffected or treated and untreated cohorts. No teratogenicity was observed at birth. It was concluded that maternal age and 3rd trimester pregnancy were found related to the risk of acquiring H1N1. No differences in obstetric outcomes or worse perinatal outcomes were found in patients affected by the pandemic. Early prophylactic treatment may be related to better maternal-fetal results."

An apparent outbreak of Candida lipolytica fungemia (n = 5 cases) occurred in a pediatric ward over a 9-week period. The five patients infected were hospitalized in three adjacent rooms and cared for by the same healthcare workers. The index patient had central venous catheter-related fungemia, whereas the second patient, who was in the adjacent single room, had transient fungemia. Three additional cases of fungemia occurred in patients with hematological disorders who shared the same room; all three patients had central venous catheters and had been receiving oral fluconazole prophylaxis (50 mg/day for more than 3 weeks) at the time of infection. In vitro susceptibility testing of the strains showed that the MIC of fluconazole for all the isolates was 32 microg/ml. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis provided evidence of the clonal origin of the isolates, but the source of the outbreak was not identified. All four patients with persistent fungemia were successfully treated via catheter removal or empiric amphotericin B treatment. This outbreak shows the potential for the nosocomial epidemic transmission of Candida lipolytica."

CD011926,0,15119362,0,Serum ALT levels as a surrogate marker for serum HBV DNA levels in HBeAg-negative pregnant women.,"In Stockholm, Sweden, the majority of pregnant women positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) negative. Newborns to HBeAg positive mothers receive vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg). Newborns to HBeAg negative mothers receive vaccine and HBIg only if the mothers have elevated ALT levels. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate ALT levels as a surrogate marker for HBV DNA levels in HBeAg negative carrier mothers. Altogether 8947 pregnant women were screened for HBV markers from 1999 to 2001 at the Virology Department, Karolinska Hospital. Among mothers screened 192 tested positive for HBsAg (2.2%). 13 of these samples could not be retrieved. Of the remaining 179 sera, 8 (4%) tested positive for HBeAg and 171 (95.5%) were HBeAg negative. Among the HBeAg negative mothers, 9 had HBV DNA levels > 10(5) copies/ml, and of these 7 had normal ALT levels indicating low sensitivity of an elevated ALT level as a surrogate marker for high HBV DNA level. Furthermore, no correlation was found between ALT and HBV DNA levels. Hence, it is concluded that the use of ALT as a surrogate marker for high viral replication in HBeAg negative mothers could be questioned."

In this study, we describe a hospital-based epidemiological study of hMPV in patients presenting to a children's hospital and show the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with hMPV infection in China, retrospectively. Specimens were collected over a 2-year period from children hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) and analyzed for the presence of hMPV using real-time RT-PCR assays. The presence of hMPV was detected in 227 (25.9%) of the 878 children studied and may circulate year-round in the area, peaking during the winter-spring season. Younger children (aged less than 6 months) had the highest positive rate. Infections by hMPV showed similar epidemiology and clinical manifestations as for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and were found in high co-infections with RSV. Subgroup A2 hMPV was the most predominant genotype identified during the study period. This study indicates that hMPV is one of the major respiratory pathogens found in children in southwest China and vaccine development should be under consideration."
CD011926,0,22794700,0,Chapter 27: Approach to primary immunodeficiency.,"Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are inherited defects of the innate or adaptive arms of the immune system that lead to an increase in the incidence, frequency, or severity of infections. There may be defects in the adaptive arm of the immune system that include combined immunodeficiency and antibody deficiency syndromes or by abnormalities in innate immunity such as disorders of phagocytes, the complement pathway, or Toll-Like receptor (TLR) mediated signaling. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza type B or Streptococcus pneumoniae may be characteristic of an IgG antibody deficiency or dysfunction. Frequent viral, fungal, or protozoal infections may suggest T lymphocyte dysfunction. Multiple staphylococcal skin infections and fungal infections may imply neutrophil dysfunction or the hyper-IgE syndrome, and recurrent neisserial infection is a characteristic manifestation of late complement component (C5-9, or the membrane attack complex) defects. Recurrent viral or pyogenic bacterial infections often without the presence of a significant inflammatory response suggest a defect in TLR signaling. Mycobacterial infections are characteristic of defects in interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN) gamma, or their receptors. Screening of newborns for T-cell lymphopenia using a polymerase chain reaction to amplify T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), which are formed when a T cell rearranges the variable region of its receptor, serves as a surrogate for newly synthesized naïve T cells. Because of very low numbers of TRECs, severe combined immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome, and other causes of T-cell lymphopenia have been identified in newborns."

CD011926,0,24958797,0,Pentaplex PCR assay for detection of hemorrhagic bacteria from stool samples.,"Diarrheal diseases cause illness and death among children younger than 10 years in developing countries. Conventional testing for the detection of hemorrhagic bacteria takes 2 to 5 days to yield complete information on the organism and its antibiotic sensitivity pattern. Hence, in the present study, we developed a molecular-based diagnostic assay that identifies common hemorrhagic bacteria in stool samples. A set of specific primers were designed for the detection of Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), and Campylobacter spp., suitable for use in a one-tube PCR assay. The assay in the present study simultaneously detected five genes, namely, ompC for the Salmonella genus, virA for the Shigella genus, eaeA for EHEC, 16S rRNA for the Campylobacter genus, and hemA for an internal control. Specific primer pairs were successfully designed and simultaneously amplified the targeted genes. Validation with 20 Gram-negative and 17 Gram-positive strains yielded 100% specificity. The limit of detection of the multiplex PCR assay was 1 × 10(3) CFU at the bacterial cell level and 100 pg at the genomic DNA level. Further evaluation of the multiplex PCR with 223 bacterium-spiked stool specimens revealed 100% sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that the developed multiplex PCR assay was rapid, giving results within 4 h, which is essential for the identification of hemorrhagic bacteria, and it might be useful as an additional diagnostic tool whenever time is important in the diagnosis of hemorrhagic bacteria that cause diarrhea. In addition, the presence of an internal control in the multiplex PCR assay is important for excluding false-negative cases."

Case report and differential diagnosis of the perinatal iron storage disorders.,"We report on a female preterm infant with hepatic failure and neonatal tissue siderosis of hemochromatotic type diagnosed by using both histochemistry and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The infant presented with meconium ileus, signs of rapidly progressive hepatic failure, and hyperferritinemia (7132 ng/ml). Despite surgery and intensive care the infant died 32 days after birth. Postmortem examination showed a wrinkled liver with extensive collapse of the hepatic architecture and regenerating nodules as well as hepatic and extrahepatic iron accumulation of hemochromatotic type, sparing the reticuloendothelial system. Atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed an increase in the iron content of various organs: liver, heart, pancreas, oral salivary gland, kidney, and adrenal gland. The increase in the iron content of various organs was determined by comparing the analysis of the propositus with those of 5 gestationally age-related preterm infants who had died in the intensive care unit: 2 died of meconium aspiration syndrome, the other 3 of hyaline membrane disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and immaturity, respectively. We also compared the analysis of 15 fetuses having a a condition predisposing to iron accumulation (trisomy 21, trisomy 18, cytomegalovirus, amnion infection syndrome, Rhesus- and ABO-incompatibility, congenital hemolysis, anti-phospholipid syndrome, congenital heart disease). Delta F508, the most frequent mutation seen in cystic fibrosis patients, was excluded by gene sequencing. Different noxae causing iron accumulation in the neonatal period have led to the statement that neonatal hemochromatosis may collect different etiologies, such as metabolic disorders, infections, chromosomal aberrations, and immunological disorders. In this study, we report the singular evidence of neonatal iron accumulation of hemochromatotic type in an infant presenting with meconium ileus and propose a classification of the neonatal disorders associated with iron accumulation."

CD011926,0,12966540,0,Quantitative analysis of HBV DNA level and HBeAg titer in hepatitis B surface antigen positive mothers and their babies: HBeAg passage through the placenta and the rate of decay in babies.,"It is well documented that perinatal transmission is the major cause of chronic HBV infection in China. However, the mechanisms of HBV perinatal transmission are not defined clearly. It is not known whether hepatitis B e antigen can cross the human placenta, and the rate of HBeAg decay in babies with and without HBV breakthrough has not been studied. In this study, HBV serological markers were investigated in 95 hepatitis B surface antigen positive pregnant women. These markers were also studied in the babies at birth and at the age of 6 months and 12 months. The data show that 7.4% (7/95) children were infected with HBV during the first year after birth despite receiving passive-active immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine. The surface gene fragment of HBV DNA was cloned and sequenced following PCR amplification in 7 cases of HBsAg positive babies and their mothers. All babies had the same sequences as their mothers, although two babies also had sequences that would produce an amino acid substitution within the ""a"" determinant. Furthermore, we measured HBeAg titers and HBV DNA levels by using Abbott AxSYM system and LightCycler-based real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR in 54 mother-infant pairs. Thirty-three mothers were HBeAg positive, and 21 mothers were HBeAg negative. Seventy percent (23/33) of neonates from HBeAg-positive mothers were HBeAg positive at birth compared with 0% (0/21) of neonates from HBeAg negative mothers. HBeAg was present at higher titer in the birth sera of the babies with HBV breakthrough than in babies without breakthrough. HBeAg was cleared from the serum in all 19 babies without breakthrough. In 17 of these 19 babies, the HBeAg was cleared within 6 months, and in two babies clearance took 12 months. The mean serum HBV DNA level in the mothers of the 4 infants with HBV breakthrough was significantly higher than in the mothers of babies who did not become infected. In conclusion, this data suggests that HBeAg can cross the human placenta, and disappears from serum within 6 months in most babies. HBV DNA levels in hepatitis B carrier mothers are associated with the failure of HBIG and vaccine immunization, and the additional influence of transmitted HBeAg cannot be excluded."

CD011926,0,17610094,0,Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in infants and children: relationship with attendance at a paediatric emergency unit and characteristics of the circulating strains.,"A study was carried out on 2,696 Italian children, aged 0-14 years. The goals were: (1) to define the age-related impact of acute respiratory infections (ARI), measured as the risk of attendance at the Paediatric Emergency Room, (2) to better define the importance and proportion of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections and (3) to acquire deeper knowledge of the influenza strains circulating in infants and children. A standardised emergency unit attendance risk (EUAR) was calculated, by age group for ARI. Specific EUARs were also calculated for the two pathogens. Pharyngeal swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza and RSVs. Isolation in Madine-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) and Hep cells, haemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing and HA1 gene sequence analysis were performed for influenza viruses. Most of the patients enrolled were aged 0-5 years, 1,139 (84.6%) and 1,061 (78.5%) in the two seasons, respectively. The most represented age class was that of 1 year olds (331 cases in 2001-2002 and 301 in 2002-2003). The highest EUAR for ARI was in patients aged 0-3 years (16.8 and 12.9 during the two seasons). The same was observed on calculating this risk by specific pathogens: 17.4 and 5.5 for influenza and 13.0 and 12.7 for RSV. Virological analysis was performed on 2,696 samples, 595 of which proved positive (22%). The highest number of isolates (326) came from patients aged 1-3 years. RSVs were more often identified than influenza viruses in infants aged up to 1 year (32 vs. 20 isolates). Of 265 strains isolated in 2001-2002, 103 were RSVs (87 type A, 16 B) and 162 were influenza (90 type A, 72 B). HI showed that influenza B viruses were related to two lineages, B/Victoria/2/87 (32%) and B/Yamagata/16/88 (68%). Of 330 strains isolated in 2002-2003, 102 were RSVs (91 type A, 11 B) and 228 were influenza viruses (220 type A, 8 B). A/H3N2 strains belonged to two clusters, A/Panama/2007/99-like and A/Fujian/411/02-like, a new variant. This paper discusses the possible role of the identified flu strains in determining EUARs among the population by age class."
CD011926,0,8584360,0,Comparison of a rapid nonisotopic polymerase chain reaction assay with four commonly used methods for the early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in neonates and children.,"To initiate antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, it is important to identify human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-infected infants as soon after birth as possible. This study was undertaken to evaluate a novel 5-hour nonisotopic (NI) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (Amplicor PCR; Roche Molecular Systems) and four other commonly used HIV-1 diagnostic tests including culture, oligonucleotide hybridization PCR, p24 antigen and immune complex-dissociated (ICD) p24 antigen tests and to determine the optimal age at which to perform these tests for the early and rapid diagnosis of HIV-1 in infants and children. We prospectively evaluated 225 infants and children, including 114 neonates, for HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 infection was defined as 2 positive HIV cultures. Of the 225 infants and children, 57 were infected, 138 were uninfected and 30 were of unknown (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Classification P0) status. The sensitivity of NI PCR was 60% in cord blood, 40% at 0 to 2 days, 67 to 80% in the neonate (3 to 30 days) and 95 to 100% after 1 month of age. NI PCR was as sensitive as oligonucleotide hybridization PCR, culture, p24 antigen and ICD p24 antigen in the first 2 months of life and was more sensitive than p24 antigen or ICD p24 antigen thereafter. Specificity was 94% for cord blood and 99 to 100% for all age groups. The majority of HIV-1-infected newborns can be identified with NI PCR if testing is performed at birth and again between the third and fourth weeks of life. For older infants and children 2 NI PCR tests can correctly diagnose 98.5% of infected and uninfected infants and children. NI PCR of umbilical cord blood might also be useful as an initial screening test to identify infants who may be infected with HIV-1."

Recent serosurveys indicate that antibody to group C rotavirus is present in 3-45% of the human population in certain geographic locations, suggesting that rotavirus group C infection is more prevalent than previously believed and that the low rate of detection of these agents is probably due to the lack of sensitive diagnostic assays. From March to December 1994, 406 fecal specimens were collected from children under five years of age who were outpatients at the emergency services of nine public hospitals in Brasília, Federal District, Brazil. In addition to the samples from children, one public outpatient unit requested virological investigation of a stool sample from an HIV-seropositive adult male with diarrhea of sudden onset. All samples were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay for group A rotavirus and adenovirus (EIARA) and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). One hundred and seven (26%) were positive for group A rotavirus. Four samples from children and the sample from the HIV-seropositive patient, although negative by EIARA, showed a group C rotavirus profile by PAGE and were positive for rotavirus by electron microscopy. Using specific VP6 and VP7 primers for group C rotavirus, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. These products were confirmed to be specific for group C rotavirus by using digoxigenin-oligonucleotide probes, Southern hybridization and chemiluminescent detection.

CD011926,0,17093017,0,Age-related urinary excretion of BK polyomavirus by nonimmunocompromised individuals.,"Two polyomaviruses, BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV), are ubiquitous in the human population, generally infecting children asymptomatically and then persisting in renal tissue. It is generally thought that reactivation leads to productive infection for both viruses, with progeny shed in the urine. Several studies have shown that the rate of JC viruria increases with the age of the host, but a systematic approach to examine the shedding of BKV has not been developed. To elucidate the relationship between BK viruria and host age, we obtained urine from donors (healthy volunteers or nonimmunocompromised patients) who were divided into nine age groups, each containing 50 members. A high-sensitivity PCR was used to detect BKV and JCV DNA from urinary samples, and the specificity of amplification was confirmed by sequencing or restriction analysis of the amplified fragments. The rate of BK viruria was relatively low in subjects aged <30 years but gradually increased with age in subjects aged > or =30 years. However, BK viruria was less frequent than JC viruria in adults. The detected BKV isolates were classified into subtypes, and detection rates for individual subtypes were compared among age groups; this analysis showed that viruria of subtypes I (the most prevalent subtype) and IV (the second most prevalent subtype) occurred more frequently in older subjects. Therefore, our results reveal new aspects of BK viruria in nonimmunocompromised individuals."

Therefore we examined nine liver DNA specimens from chronic HBV carriers ages 5-14 years and one sample from a neonate delivered of a carrier mother, in order to determine the HBV DNA patterns of these patients at different ages and phases of chronic infection. The integrated HBV DNA was detected by Southern blot hybridization and analyzed by molecular cloning. Southern blot showed a smear pattern of HBV DNA integration in four of six chronic hepatitis patients (ages 5-14), as well as in one asymptomatic carrier (age 12). Multiple and random integrations occurred during chronic infections in childhood. The neonate did not, however, show signs of any integrations, suggesting that integration starts after HBV multiplication. A band pattern that suggested clonal growth of integrated liver cells was found in a chronic active hepatitis patient (age 9) and in one of two hepatocellular carcinoma patients (age 11). Molecular cloning in two cases with chronic active hepatitis showed that the HBV genome structure was preserved in five of six HBV DNA inserts. Our findings confirm that HBV DNA integration can occur at early stages of chronic HBV infection. In Japanese children, the process of integration seems to be common regardless of HBeAg/anti-HBe status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011926,0,19382268,0,"Detection and characterization of group C rotavirus in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1997-2003.","The role of group C rotaviruses as a cause of diarrhea was examined among children <17 years of age admitted to a Hospital in a suburban area of Buenos Aires, Argentina between 1997 and 2003. A total of 1,579 fecal samples were screened for group A (RVA) and C (RVC) rotaviruses by two in-house ELISA methods at Quilmes University (UNQ-ELISA). Samples positive, doubtful and negative by RVC specific UNQ-ELISA (n = 246) were examined further for RVC by another in-house ELISA (CDC-ELISA), electron microscopy, RT-PCR, nested PCR, and Southern hybridization. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for each test were determined. While the sensitivity was comparable for the nested PCR and CDC-ELISA methods (82.5%), the molecular methods were slightly more specific. Poorly preserved particles were often seen in fecal samples, suggesting that degradation of RNA could be a factor influencing the performance of molecular methods. The incidence of RVC was estimated to be 3% without apparent differences among seasons. RVC infected patients had a significantly (P < 0.001) higher median age (6 years vs. 1 year) than those with RVA infection. Sequence of the RVC VP7 gene from six Argentinean strains and sequences reported previously in different countries showed high nucleotide (94.4-99.9%) sequence identities, indicating a high degree of conservation for human RVC VP7 genes among strains collected on five continents over a period of 17 years. These findings indicate that RVC is a significant cause of diarrhea and it is necessary to develop simple and sensitive serological methods for its detection."
CD011926,0,16847968,0,"Frequent detection of human rhinoviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and bocavirus during acute respiratory tract infections.","Viruses are the major cause of pediatric acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and yet many suspected cases of infection remain uncharacterized. We employed 17 PCR assays and retrospectively screened 315 specimens selected by season from a predominantly pediatric hospital-based population. Before the Brisbane respiratory virus research study commenced, one or more predominantly viral pathogens had been detected in 15.2% (n = 48) of all specimens. The Brisbane study made an additional 206 viral detections, resulting in the identification of a microbe in 67.0% of specimens. After our study, the majority of microbes detected were RNA viruses (89.9%). Overall, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most frequently identified target (n = 140) followed by human adenoviruses (HAdVs; n = 25), human metapneumovirus (HMPV; n = 18), human bocavirus (HBoV; n = 15), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; n = 12), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; n = 11), and human herpesvirus-6 (n = 11). HRVs were the sole microbe detected in 37.8% (n = 31) of patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Genotyping of the HRV VP4/VP2 region resulted in a proposed subdivision of HRV type A into sublineages A1 and A2. Most of the genotyped HAdV strains were found to be type C. This study describes the high microbial burden imposed by HRVs, HMPV, HRSV, HCoVs, and the newly identified virus, HBoV on a predominantly paediatric hospital population with suspected acute respiratory tract infections and proposes a new formulation of viral targets for future diagnostic research studies."

CD011926,0,9171845,0,Serotype of Nigerian rotavirus strains.,"Three hundred and fourteen stool samples collected from children < 5 years between December 1993 and August 1995 were analysed by PAGE, ELISA, PCR and Dot-blot hybridization technique for electropherotype and serotype distribution of rotavirus infection among Nigerian paediatric patients. 14.3% of the children were positive for rotavirus antigen. Children aged 6-9 months were most often infected, accounting for 35.6% of all positive samples, 91.1% of rotavirus-positive samples could be serotyped. Serotypes G2, G4 and G8 were not detected. Serotype G3 predominated (62.5%) in southern Nigeria, while mixed infection specificity was more widespread (63.6%) in northern Nigeria. The presence of some untypeable samples may indicate serotypes which the serotype-specific primers and cDNA probes used could not detect. Electropherotypes of 26 (57.7%) of the positive samples were determined. Two and 3 migration patterns were observed among the short and long-pattern electropherotypes, respectively. Implications for vaccine development and utilization in the country are discussed."
CD011926,0,17516526,0,Application of molecular and serological assays to case based investigations of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome.,"Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome continue to be important health problems worldwide. The detection of rubella RNA directly in clinical specimens is a critical factor in early laboratory diagnosis of recent or congenital infection, in addition to detection of rubella-specific IgM. In order to comply with recent WHO recommendations for establishing uniform genetic analysis protocols for rubella virus we have developed a new block based PCR assay (PCR-E317), which extends the sequence generated by the block based PCR-E592 currently in use, to cover the minimum acceptable 739 nucleotides (nt) window at the E1 gene. In addition, a real-time PCR assay has been developed to allow rapid detection of the virus in the laboratory. The assays were applied to a number of clinical specimens collected from patients including recent rubella incidences in the UK, Ethiopia and Turkey, two prenatal and two congenital rubella syndrome cases. Rubella RNA was detected in specimens from two patients that were collected too early for IgM detection, in two amniotic fluids for prenatal diagnosis and in the follow up specimens from the two infant with congenital rubella syndrome tested for viral secretion. At least four genotypes were identified among these patients. The results showed that molecular assays are important tools in the early diagnosis of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome, in the provision of molecular epidemiological information for tracking transmission pathways and in adding to the knowledge of rubella strain distribution worldwide."

CD011926,0,8433285,0,Antibody avidity measurement and immune complex dissociation for serological diagnosis of vertically acquired HIV-1 infection.,"Differences in avidity between HIV-1 antibodies transmitted passively and antibodies synthesized by children born to HIV-1-positive mothers can be measured using a commercially available competitive enzyme immunoassay kit. The avidity determination method is based on the competition between an anti-HIV-1-peroxidase-labeled antibody at a stable and known concentration and the anti-HIV-1 antibodies (IgA, IgG, IgM) present in the child's serum at various and increasing dilutions. The shift in the competition/dilution curves between serum samples taken at the third and the sixth month of the child's life showed either the loss or the synthesis of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. The antibody avidity determination combined with a test detecting free or complexed p24 antigen is a workable and inexpensive serological method for the follow-up of children born to seropositive mothers. Combining these two complementary methods, HIV-1 infection has been established at 6 months of age in 13 of 13 infants, and positive results were confirmed by coculture and by PCR. An HIV-1 infection was excluded at 6 months of age in 17 of 17 infants, results otherwise confirmed by virological and clinical follow-up. These new and convenient approaches to the diagnosis of vertically acquired HIV-1 could be used worldwide, including in developing countries."
CD011926,0,12942395,0,An echovirus type 33 winter outbreak in New Zealand.,"Echovirus type 33 (E33) is a relatively uncommon enterovirus. An E33 outbreak during the winter of 2000 in New Zealand led to 75 virologically-confirmed cases of E33 infection (2.6 cases per 100,000 individuals). Sixty-six (88%) of the 75 patients were aged <30 years, with the highest rates of infection recorded in Maori and Pacific ethnic groups. Overall, 47 (84%) of 56 patients whose cases were analyzed had either aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. Central nervous system involvement was more common after infancy (43 of 45 non-infant patients vs. 4 of 11 infants [relative risk, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.3]). Two infants died, including a neonate with fulminant hepatitis. Independent of symptom duration, neutrophil-predominant pleocytosis was detected in 17 (41%) of 41 cerebrospinal fluid specimens. Virus isolates could not be definitively typed by antibody neutralization testing but were identified as E33 by partial sequencing of the VP-1 capsid gene. The isolates were closely related to strains from Australia and Oman. Molecular typing, together with a serotype-specific E33 PCR, improved the speed and effectiveness of the outbreak investigation."
CD011926,0,11716634,0,Molecular epidemiological typing of Enterobacter cloacae isolates from a neonatal intensive care unit: three-year prospective study.,"Since 1992, there has been an increase in the incidence of Enterobacter sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the authors' hospital. From 1995 to 1997, a prospective molecular epidemiological survey of the colonizing and infecting strains isolated from neonates was conducted. Enterobacter cloacae was the most frequent cause of neonatal sepsis, accounting for 19.2% of all neonatal infections, reaching a peak incidence of 2.2/1000 during 1996. Fifty isolates from the NICU and four epidemiologically unrelated strains were characterized by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), ribotyping, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR and plasmid profiling. PFGE was the most discriminatory technique and identified 13 types (two of them classified into two and three subtypes) compared with ERIC-PCR, plasmid profiling and ribotyping that identified 11, 11 and seven types, respectively. A good correlation was found between all techniques. Five different clones caused 15 cases of sepsis. Clones A and B were prevalent in 1995 and 1996, but they were not isolated in 1997. An outbreak caused by clone G in 1997 was controlled by cohort nursing and hygienic measures, without changing the antibiotic policy. Strains were characterized by their antibiotic resistance pattern and divided into three groups. Group I correlated with PFGE types A, B1 and B2, which hyperproduced Bush type 1 chromosomal beta-lactamase and expressed extended-spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBLs). Group II only hyperproduced Bush type 1 chromosomal beta-lactamase and correlated with PFGE-types D1, D2, D3 and I. Finally, Group III, with inducible beta-lactamases, correlated with the rest of PFGE types. The sudden disappearance of E. cloacae after reinforcement of hygienic measures confirms the importance of patient-to-patient transmission."
CD011926,0,16300992,0,Breast milk as a source for acquisition of cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in a premature infant with sepsis syndrome: detection by real-time PCR.,"Symptomatic disease due to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been increasingly recognized in low birth weight (LBW) premature infants. Breast milk has been identified as a potential source for these infections. At approximately 60 days of life a LBW, premature infant was diagnosed with HCMV sepsis syndrome, prompting further investigation of the source for HCMV acquisition. The infant had received a combination of both fresh and frozen breast milk from his mother throughout his first 2 months of life. We utilized a real-time PCR assay for HCMV DNA to retrospectively examine viral genome copy number in serial samples of stored, frozen breast milk. This analysis indicated an increase in breast milk viral load over the first 45 days of life, heralding the HCMV sepsis syndrome that was observed clinically. Real-time PCR may be a useful tool in the evaluation of HCMV viral load in breast milk."
CD011926,0,18204300,0,Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis presence in umbilical cord is associated with pathogenesis of funisitis.,"Ureaplasma urealyticum (U. urealyticum) and Mycoplasma hominis (M. hominis) are known to cause an intrauterine infection for preterm deliveries, but it is not known whether they are actually pathogenically involved in the development of funisitis, chorioamnionitis (CAM), and chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm infants. Our purpose was to identify U. urealyticum and M. hominis in the umbilical cord, placenta, and tracheal aspirate (TA) or gastric fluid (GF) of preterm infants, and to clarify whether they contribute to funisitis, CAM, and CLD. Of 128 preterm infants, 86 umbilical cords, 83 placentas, and 84 TA or GF samples obtained postnatally from preterm infants were examined. U. urealyticum and M. hominis were detected by polymerase chain reaction and prospectively analyzed to determine whether the presence of U. urealyticum or M. hominis can lead to the development of funisitis, CAM, and CLD. U. urealyticum or M. hominis was isolated in nine (10.5%) of the umbilical cords, five (6.0%) of the placentas, and fifteen (17.9%) of the TA or GF samples. Funisitis was identified in all umbilical cords with U. urealyticum or M. hominis, but in only 13% of the umbilical cords without U. urealyticum and M. hominis (p < 0.001). Placentas and TA or GF with or without U. urealyticum and M. hominis did not show significant differences with regard to the development of CAM or CLD. Our results suggest that U. urealyticum and M. hominis presence is associated with the pathogenesis of funisitis, but not of CAM or CLD."
CD011926,0,11765663,0,[Neonatal sepsis].,"Sepsis is still one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period. Infection is responsible for approximately 2 million neonatal deaths per year in developing countries. In Italy, as in other industrialized countries, the mortality rate has declined to 5.1 per 1000 livebirths. Progress in obstetrics and neonatal intensive care competence have improved survival particularly of preterm and low birth weight neonates. These neonates, for the immunological state and the invasive therapies they are subjected to, are extremely at risk for sepsis. Knowledge of neonatal risk factors, together with cytokines evaluation as early markers of sepsis and laboratory tests such as polymerase chain reaction, have allowed us to accelerate the diagnosis of sepsis with prognostic improvements. The frequent involvement of group B streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci requires empiric antibiotic therapy, effective for these pathogens, in all infants with suspected infection, waiting for blood cultures and antibiotic susceptibility results. Breast milk, carrier of immunologically active agents, is still the best prophylaxis for neonatal sepsis."
CD011926,0,17698631,0,Genetic characteristics and clonal dissemination of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae strains isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in Japan.,"We evaluated the recent prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the upper respiratory tracts (URT) of patients in Japan. Mutations in the ftsI gene, which encodes penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3), and the clonal dissemination of the resistant strains were also investigated. A total of 264 H. influenzae isolates were collected from patients with URT infections. According to the criteria of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute for the susceptibility of H. influenzae to ampicillin (AMP), the isolates were distributed as follows: 161 (61.0%) susceptible strains (MIC < or = 1 microg/ml), 37 (14.0%) intermediately resistant strains (MIC = 2 microg/ml), and 66 (25.0%) resistant strains (MIC > or = 4 microg/ml). According to PCR-based genotyping, 172 (65.1%) of the isolates had mutations in the ftsI gene and were negative for the beta-lactamase (bla) gene. These 172 isolates were thus defined as genetically beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (gBLNAR) strains. The ftsI mutant group included 98 (37.1%) strains with group I/II mutations in the variable mutated region (group I/II gBLNAR) and 74 (28.0%) strains with group III mutations in the highly mutated region (group III gBLNAR). Eighty-seven (33.0%) of the isolates were genetically beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-susceptible (gBLNAS) strains. The group III gBLNAR strains showed resistance to beta-lactams. Only five strains (1.9%) were positive for a bla gene encoding TEM-type beta-lactamase. The three clusters consisting of 16 strains found among the 61 BLNAR strains (MIC > or = 4 microg/ml and without the bla gene) showed identical or closely related DNA restriction fragment patterns. Those isolates were frequently identified among strains with a MIC to AMP of 16 microg/ml. The current study demonstrates the apparent dissemination and spread of a resistant clone of H. influenzae among medical centers in Japan. The gBLNAR strains show a remarkable prevalence among H. influenzae isolates, with the prevalence increasing with time. This fact should be taken into account when treating URT infections."

CD011926,0,9182141,0,[Use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of toxoplasmosis].,"The aim of the study was to assess the value of PCR method in laboratory diagnosis of T. gondii infections. The study was based on the identification of a fragment of B1 gene of Toxoplasma gondii 461 base pairs in length in 124 samples of blood, CSF, amniotic fluid and aqueous fluid obtained form humans and experimentally infected animals. Positive PCR results were found with CSF samples and blood sample from men. Moreover, the results were positive with blood samples from mice and rabbits bled on 5, 6, 11 and 12 days after infection. The obtained results showed that PCR is very useful in the laboratory diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, especially in cases suspected of cerebral toxoplasmosis. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that neurotoxoplasmosis occurs in Poland, more frequently that it is realized at present, however, the cases are not recognized because toxoplasmosis is not taken into account in differential diagnosis. Because of short and irregular parasitaemia, PCR is of limited value in the diagnosis of blood samples."

A PCR-RFLP assay for the detection and differentiation of five types of E. coli cdtB gene (types I through V) was developed, and 362 stool specimens collected from patients reporting to pediatric departments in two hospitals were analyzed. Of the 35 samples (9.7%) that were positive for the cdtB gene, 21 were positive for cdt-I, three for cdt-II, four for cdt-III, three for cdt-IV and four samples were positive for cdt-V, as determined by different molecular techniques. The recovery of CTEC having cdt alleles was a little less, which included 19 with cdt-I, one cdt-II, three cdt-III, three cdt-IV and four with cdt-V. Among 30 CTEC strains isolated, the majority of them (43%) belonged to serogroup 02. The other virulence genes such as astA, cnfl, eaeA, cnf2 and bfpA genes were detected in 14 (47%), 11 (37%), four (13%), three (10%) and one (3.3%) strains of CTEC, respectively. However, the other common virulence-associated genes specific for DEC were not detected in these strains. Interestingly, an untypable cdt gene was detected by PCR-RFLP in Providencia alcalifaciens. Our data indicate that CTEC may be associated with diarrheal children in Japan and most of them do not belong to a conventional enteropathogenic pathovar and thus differ from strains isolated in developing countries."

Mean clinical delay from birth to first clinical symptoms is 6 to 12 days and neonate is usually symptom - free at birth. Viral cultures from pharynx, stools, cutaneous lesions and specific PCR in blood and cerebrospinal fluid confirm the diagnosis. Curative treatment is acyclovir at high dosage - 60 mg/kg/d - during 14 days for localized forms and 21 days for neurological and disseminated diseases. Compared to conventional dosages, this treatment leads to a reduction in mortality which however remains high in disseminated forms, 31 p. 100 and 6 to 11 p. 100 in CNS infection. Morbidity is also high in survived patients, 17 p. 100 and 31 p. 100 respectively. Efficacy of prophylactic viral decontamination by anti-herpetic eye drops and cutaneous polyvidone iodine bath, which is largely used at birth in France, has never been evaluated."

CD011926,0,20029808,0,"Human bocavirus infection in young children with acute respiratory tract infection in Lanzhou, China.","Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recognized human parvovirus associated with acute respiratory tract infection. However, HBoV has yet to be established as a causative agent of respiratory disease. In this study, the epidemiological and virological characteristics of HBoV infection were studied in children with acute respiratory tract infection in China. In total, 406 children younger than 14 years of age with acute respiratory tract infection were included in this prospective 1-year study. HBoV was detected in 29 (7.1%) of the 406 children. No clear seasonal fluctuation was observed in infection rates of HBoV. Of the 29 children infected with HBoV, 16 (55.2%) were coinfected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Viral coinfection with HBoV did not affect the severity of the respiratory disease (P = 0.291). The number of HBoV genome copies ranged from 5.80 x 10(2) to 9.72 x 10(8) copies/ml in nasopharyngeal aspirates among HBoV-positive specimens by real-time PCR, and neither coinfection nor the severity of disease correlated with the viral load (P = 0.148, P = 0.354, respectively). The most common clinical features were cough and acute upper respiratory infection, and acute bronchopneumonia. Additionally, the NP-1 gene of HBoV showed minimal sequence variation. These data suggest that HBoV is frequent in young children with acute respiratory tract infection in Lanzhou, China, and RSV is the most common coinfecting virus. There was no apparent association between the viral load of HBoV and coinfection or disease severity. The NP-1 gene was highly conserved in HBoV."

A formulated multiprex method employing 4 kinds of paired primers on amplification of 4 corresponding different insertion sequences (IS481, IS1001, IS1002 and hIS1001) enabled rapid screening and identification. The detection limits of each DNA extracted from 3 kinds of Bordetella species were 5fg/microL for each. Obscure existences of B. pertussis and B. holmesii at low levels were confirmed with the LAMP method. This multiplex assay was applied to the clinical specimens obtained from patients with pertussis-like symptoms at sentinel clinics under the epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases of Hyogo prefecture in FY2012. Among 42 nasopharyngeal swabs, B. pertussis was detected from 12 samples including 8 samples collected at outbreak in nursery school. The use of this method for the surveillance of infectious agents enabled us to search for 3 kinds of Bordetella species at once with low costs."

CD011926,0,9240862,0,Anonymous testing of newborn infants for HIV antibodies as a basis for estimating prevalence of HIV in childbearing women: the 1991-1994 study in Spain.,"During 1991-1994, anonymous screening of newborn infants for maternal antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was carried out in three regions of Spain: Valencia, Galicia and Sevilla. The newborn infants whose heel-stick blood eluates were satisfactory for HIV antibody tests were a consecutive series of 104 876, representing 99.3% of all newborn infants undergoing routine metabolic screening and estimated as comprising at least 98% of all births in the three regions. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) positives were confirmed by immunoblot, yielding 246 confirmations: a rate of 2.3 per 1000. Seropositivity rates ranged from 1.4 per 1000 in Galicia to 2.1 in Sevilla and 3.1 in Valencia, and remained relatively stable in each region during the years of the study. Within socioeconomically defined subgroups of birth hospitals in Valencia and Galicia, all subgroups contained seropositives, even though there was a twofold to fivefold over-representation in the ""inner city"" public hospitals. To estimate the proportion of HIV-1-seropositive newborn infants who were positive for HIV-1 DNA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed on 165 dried blood spots that had been retained following positive immunoblot assays. Fifteen (9%) were PCR positive, and when this proportion is adjusted for the age-specific sensitivity of the method, it translates into an estimated HIV-1 transmission rate of 24% (range 18-36%). For 94,906 of the 104,876 newborn infants screened, the EIA used could detect antibodies that react with epitopes of HIV-1 and HIV-2. There were 30 newborn infants whose blood eluate was positive by this combined HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody screen and whose secondary screening with monovalent HIV-2 and HIV-1 EIA indicated that the HIV-2 reactivity was above the cut-off whereas the HIV-1 was not. Ranking these 30 results according to absolute HIV-2 reactivity and relative reactivity with respect to HIV-1 indicated that four infants were probable true HIV-2 seropositives and a total of 12 were possible HIV-2 seropositives, a prevalence of the order of 1:10000 to 1:20000 newborn infants. These anonymous population-based serological studies provide ""leading-indicator"" data to complement traditional AIDS surveillance for epidemiological and planning purposes."
CD011926,0,22116144,0,Comparison of the Idaho Technology FilmArray system to real-time PCR for detection of respiratory pathogens in children.,"The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) multiplexed nucleic acid amplification test (Idaho Technology, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) was compared to laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays for the detection of various respiratory viruses and certain bacterial pathogens. A total of 215 frozen archived pediatric respiratory specimens previously characterized as either negative or positive for one or more pathogens by real-time PCR were examined using the FilmArray RP system. Overall agreement between the FilmArray RP and corresponding real-time PCR assays for shared analytes was 98.6% (kappa = 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.89 to 0.94]). The combined positive percent agreement was 89.4% (95% CI, 85.4 to 92.6); the negative percent agreement was 99.6% (95% CI, 99.2 to 99.8). The mean real-time PCR threshold cycle (C(T)) value for specimens with discordant results was 36.46 ± 4.54. Detection of coinfections and correct identification of influenza A virus subtypes were comparable to those of real-time PCR when using the FilmArray RP. The greatest comparative difference in sensitivity was observed for adenovirus; only 11 of 24 (45.8%; 95% CI, 27.9 to 64.9) clinical specimens positive for adenovirus by real-time PCR were also positive by the FilmArray RP. In addition, upon testing 20 characterized adenovirus serotypes prepared at high and low viral loads, the FilmArray RP did not detect serotypes 6 and 41 at either level and failed to detect serotypes 2, 20, 35, and 37 when viral loads were low. The FilmArray RP system is rapid and extremely user-friendly, with results available in just over 1 h with almost no labor involved. Its low throughput is a significant drawback for laboratories receiving large numbers of specimens, as only a single sample can be processed at a time with one instrument."

CD011926,0,8099082,0,Genetic characterization of a cryptic genospecies of Haemophilus causing urogenital and neonatal infections.,"In recent years, reports originating from several areas of the world have identified biotype IV strains of Haemophilus influenzae as a cause of serious urogenital, neonatal, and mother-infant infections. Preliminary analysis of a sample of biotype IV isolates found evidence for a cryptic genospecies of Haemophilus (R. Quentin, A. Goudeau, R. J. Wallace, Jr., A. L. Smith, R. K. Selander, and J. M. Musser. J. Gen. Microbiol. 136:1203-1209, 1990). Eighteen biotype IV strains assigned to the cryptic genospecies were further characterized by their rDNA restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and genomic DNA-DNA hybridization. Isolates of the cryptic genospecies have distinctive rDNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms that differ from those of Haemophilus haemolyticus and H. influenzae. Genomic hybridization studies show that these organisms are allied with H. influenzae and H. haemolyticus and suggest a distant trifurcation of H. influenzae, H. haemolyticus, and the cryptic genospecies."

The aim of this study was to continue the epidemiological surveillance of norovirus (NoV) infections in Tunisian children suffering from acute gastroenteritis. Surveillance was initiated in January 2003, to monitor potential variations in strains over time, in terms of frequency and diversity of NoV genotypes, and more particularly the potential emergence of new GII.4 variants following the 2004 Hunter variant. From April 2007 to April 2010, a total of 407 stool specimens were collected from sporadic cases (238 inpatients and 169 outpatients). Furthermore, 28 stool samples were collected from children involved in 3 gastroenteritis outbreaks. Stool specimens were screened for NoV genogroup I (GI) and II (GII) by RT-PCR. NoV strains were genotyped, and variants identified, based on sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the polymerase and capsid genes. NoVs were detected in 38 sporadic cases (9.3%) and 21 epidemic cases (75%). Great diversity was observed throughout the period, with seven distinct NoV genotypes characterized in sporadic cases, and three in outbreaks. GIIb/II.3 and GII.4 were predominant globally, with fluctuations of their prevalence over time. Interestingly, the Hunter variant, which was the unique GII.4 variant observed from 2003 to April 2007 in the region of Monastir, was replaced by the 2006b variant. NoV is an important enteropathogen responsible for viral gastroenteritis among infants and children in Tunisia, and the infecting strains between 2007 and 2010 were different from those in previous years."

We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for rapid diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis. This assay was applied to 257 CSF specimens during a large community outbreak of enterovirus disease; 109 (97%) of 112 enterovirus culture-positive CSF samples contained enterovirus RNA. In addition 35 (66%) of 53 samples from patients with suspected central nervous system disease with negative or no CSF viral cultures were positive by enterovirus PCR. The enterovirus PCR detected 13 different enterovirus serotypes. PCR results are available within 24 hours compared with a mean of 6.8 days for enterovirus culture. The clinical characteristics of 141 patients with enterovirus central nervous system disease are presented. This study demonstrates the usefulness of enterovirus PCR for the rapid diagnosis of enterovirus central nervous system disease and the potential for PCR tests to shorten hospitalization.

Eighty-one neonates were infected. Three cases were asymptomatic, 73 cases had gastroenteritis as the only clinical condition, and 5 cases had bacteremia associated with gastroenteritis. All isolates from stool and blood samples (n=86) were identified as Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was determined by clavulanate disk potentiation assay in all isolates. Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) was performed in 26 selected isolates, which were chosen as being representative of different clusters, to determine the clonal relationship. PCR, isoelectric focusing and sequence analysis revealed the production of CTX-M-3, TEM-1 and SHV-12 by these isolates in 23%, 76.9% and 100%, respectively. None of the isolates had PER beta-lactamase production. Standard infection control measures such as handwashing and disinfection procedures were implemented in initial clusters.

Nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 700 patients (313 female, 387 male; age range: 24 days-94 yrs, median age: 1 yr) between December 2010 - January 2013 with flu-like symptoms including fever, headache, sore throat, rhinitis, cough, myalgia as defined by the World Health Organization were included in the study. Nucleic acid extractions (Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit, iNtRON, South Korea) and cDNA synthesis (RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kits, Fermentas, USA) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Multiplex amplification of nucleic acids was performed using DPO (dual priming oligonucleotide) primers and RV5 ACE Screening Kit (Seegene, South Korea) in terms of the presence of influenza A (INF-A) virus, influenza B (INF-B) virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the other respiratory viruses. PCR products were detected by automated polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Screen Tape multiple detection system. Specimens which were positive for viral nucleic acids have been further studied by using specific DPO primers, FluA ACE Subtyping and RV15 Screening (Seegene, South Korea) kits. Four INF-A virus subtypes [human H1 (hH1), human H3 (hH3), swine H1 (sH1), avian H5 (aH5)] and 11 other respiratory viruses [Adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1-4, human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus types A and B, human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, 229E/NL63] were investigated with those tests. In the study, 53.6% (375/700) of the patients were found to be infected with at least one virus and multiple respiratory virus infections were detected in 15.7% (59/375) of the positive cases, which were mostly (49/59, 83%) in pediatric patients. RSV and rhinovirus coinfections were the most prevalent (18/29, 62.7%) dual infections. The distribution of 436 respiratory viruses identified from 375 patients were as follows; 189 (43.3%) RSV, 93 (21.4%) rhinovirus, 86 (19.8%) INF-A, seven (1.6%) INF-B, 22 (5%) PIV types 1-3, 14 (3.2%) HMPV, 11 (2.5%) HCoV, nine (2%) HBoV, and five (1.2%) adenovirus. Fifty-five (64%) out of 86 INF-A viruses were subtyped as hH3, 24 (27.9%) were sH1 and seven (8.1%) were hH1. Avian H5 was not detected in any samples. The overall prevalence rates of INF-A, INF-B, RSV and other respiratory viruses were 12%, 1%, 27%, and 14.6%, respectively. RSV was the most prevalent respiratory agent in pediatric (161/313, 51%) cases, while INF-A virus in adult (24/62, 38.7%) patients. Influenza viruses were detected as responsible pathogens in 13.3% (93/700) of the patients with flu-like symptoms. Among the cases, a 1-month-old baby was infected with three virus strains (INF-A hH1+INF-A sH1+HCoV OC43) and a 82-year-old patient was infected with two INF-A virus subtypes (hH3 + sH1). INF-A viruses were mostly detected (79/86) in winter period, from December to March. INF-A virus sH1, was the most prevalent subtype in flu cases till February 2011 (22/86), after replaced by INF-A virus hH3. Beginning from February 2012, a significant increase observed in the cases infected with INF-A virus subtype hH3 (39/86). In conclusion, the identification and surveillance of influenza virus types and subtypes circulating in populations have importance both for epidemiological data and selection of vaccine strains."

CD011926,0,25029812,0,[Do we need a different approach to GBS screening?].,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infections remain an important cause of perinatal complications, despite advanced preventive measures. The most common clinical symptoms of early-onset disease, diagnosed in neonates up to 7 days of life, are sepsis and pneumonia. Late-onset disease is diagnosed in children between 7 and 89 days of life and presents also in forms of other infections. As a result of collaborative efforts of clinicians, researchers and many organizations, various recommendations for intrapartum prevention of perinatal GBS disease have been issued so far. Revised 2002 CDC guidelines for the prevention of early-onset GBS disease recommended universal culture-based screening of all pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation to optimize the identification of those who should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP). They were customized by the Polish Gynecological Society and applied in Poland as well. As a result of preventive efforts worldwide, global incidence of GBS infections has declined dramatically over the past 15 years. About 10-30% of pregnant women are colonized with Group B Streptococcus. According to the literature, GBS culture at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation has about 95% negative predictive value for the absence of colonization at the time of labor. However, studies reporting early-onset GBS disease in newborns found that about 60 to 80% of all cases occurred in neonates with negative maternal screening during pregnancy. If the only available screening test is vagino-rectal swab during pregnancy about 7.5% of women with GBS colonization during labor are not administered IAP. It seems optimal to perform routine screening not during pregnancy but directly before the delivery--preferably at the time of regular uterine contractions or the rupture of membranes. As the screening test should be widely accessible and rapid, the usual microbiological culture is not a suitable option. Recently new biochemical and genetic methods have become available. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and optical immunoassay are candidates for rapid patient intrapartum GBS testing to determine whether women in labor are colonized with GBS. PCR tests have the sensitivity of over 90% with the specificity of 99%, which is about 13% higher than microbiological culture. According to the literature, IAP does not reduce the overall neonatal mortality mortality due to GBS infection, or due to other bacterial infections. The incidence of early-onset GBS infection was reduced with IAP in comparison to no intrapartum prophylaxis, but there was no difference in late-onset GBS disease occurrence. Besides GBS, IAP may influence maternal and neonatal infections caused by other pathogens. Moreover, it can also induce GBS and no-GBS pathogen resistance to antibiotics. It therefore seems necessary to replace the current type of GBS screening with GBS DNA PCR intrapartal test--a rapid, highly sensitive and specific method of carrier identification--in order to optimize IAP and, eventually to decrease the rate of early onset GBS disease in neonates."

We present the first report of detection of coxsackievirus B3 in the mothers' milk of 2 severely infected neonates by culture and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is a rapid and sensitive tool to detect coxsackievirus B3 in breast milk within few hours. By 12 to 14 days after onset of symptoms, coxsackievirus B3 could not be detected in the breast milk of the symptomatic mothers."

CD011926,0,9298729,0,Evaluation of a newly developed HIV antigen test.,"A new monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassay (Innogenetics) for the detection and quantification of p24 core antigens of HIV-1 (group M and group O) and of HIV-2 was evaluated on 2745 serum samples and 18 culture supernatants and compared with a reference (Coulter) HIV-1 p24 antigen assay. Positive results were confirmed by neutralization with the reagents of the respective tests. As demonstrated by dilution series of HIV cocultures, the new test recognizes p24 antigen of the most common HIV genetic subtypes, including group O and HIV-2. Titres ranged from 729 to 531441. Therefore p24 antigen assay is but very weakly reactive with HIV-2 (titres from 9 to 81). The new test is considerably more sensitive than the reference. In a population of 365 follow-up samples from 86 different patients, representing all stages of infection, the new test detected p24 antigen at least once in 52% (45/86) of these patients, whereas the reference was positive in 31% (27/86). The newly designed test detected antigen in 40% (145/365) of the samples, while the reference was positive in 21% (75/365). In a group of PCR and/or culture positive neonates, 33% (9/27) of the samples were positive with the new test versus 18% (5/27) with the reference. The specificity of the new test, as determined on 2,000 blood donor samples, was 99.65% (initially), 99.80% (after repetition), and 100% (with neutralization). The reference scored 99.95%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. In 300 seronegative samples from persons at risk, the initial specificity of the new test was 98.67% (the reference, 99.00%). With neutralization, both assays were 100% specific."

The clinical manifestations of viral CNS infection are the most important clues for diagnosis and treatment. The 1-year prospective study to explore the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings of viral CNS infection in children, including human herpes virus (HHV) type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7, enterovirus B, mumps virus, measles virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, JC virus, BK polyomavirus, Nipha virus and influenza virus (H1N1, H3N2) were performed. Total of 71 children suspected CNS infection, aged between 2 days to 12.9 years were enrolled from May 2009 to April 2010. Total 4 children with non CNS infection, 5 bacterial meningitis, 2 tuberculous meningitis CNS infection were excluded. The HHV2 (50.0%) was the most common viral CNS infection. Other viral CNS infection included HHV1 (11.60%), VZV (6.7%), HHV6 (3.3%), HHV7 (3.3%), enterovirus B (1.67%) and H3N2 (1.67%).

CD011926,0,24103134,0,[Congenital CMV infections].,"Only 10-15% of neonates with congenital cytomegalovirus infection have symptoms at birth. The most common symptoms are intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, petechiae, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, intracranial abnormalities, ophthalmological abnormalities and hearing loss. Symptomatic and asymptomatic CMV infections can both have long-term effects. CMV infection during pregnancy is diagnosed using a blood test and possible testing of the amniotic fluid for viral DNA. Infection of the fetus may be prevented by treating the mother with CMV hyperimmune globulin. In the neonate a diagnosis can be made by viral culture or PCR in urine. PCR in saliva could be an alternative. Blood testing is of limited value. If symptoms of CMV infection occur in the neonate, such as petechiae, microcephaly, central nervous system abnormalities, sensorineural hearing loss or chorioretinitis, antiviral treatment should be considered. Long-term follow-up is advisable because of the possibility of delayed-onset hearing loss and chorioretinitis."

The presence of enterovirus and herpesviruses was studied in cerebrospinal fluid samples collected prospectively from 200 patients hospitalized with neurological diseases suspected of viral infection. Positive PCR results for enterovirus and neurotropic herpesvirus (herpes simplex, HSV, and varicella zoster, VZV) were obtained among the immunocompetent patients (55/156, 35%) who presented aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. Among immunocompromised patients the yield of positive PCR results was 41% (18/44), predominantly lymphotropic herpesviruses (15/44, 34%). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was detected in patients with several clinical syndromes, including encephalitis, chronic meningitis, retinitis, ventriculitis, polyradiculomyelitis, and myeloradiculitis. Epstein-Barr (EBV) and VZV-specific DNA sequences were detected in patients with either encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, and chronic meningitis. Dual infections of CMV and HSV or CMV and EBV were established in two AIDS patients with encephalitis and polyradiculomyelitis, respectively. The applications of this RT multiplex PCR assay are extensive and may prove to be particularly valuable for the rapid and sensitive diagnosis of neurological diseases in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients."

Cloning and sequencing of the responsible determinant from BM4489 revealed a coding sequence of 912 bp encoding a class A beta-lactamase named CAD-1. The bla(CAD-1) gene was assigned to a chromosomal location in the two strains that had distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. CAD-1 shared 53% and 42% identity with beta-lactamases from Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Alignment of CAD-1 with other class A beta-lactamases indicated the presence of 25 out of the 26 isofunctional amino acids in class A beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli harboring bla(CAD-1) exhibited resistance to penams (benzylpenicillin and amoxicillin) and remained susceptible to amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid. Mature CAD-1 consisted of a 34.4-kDa polypeptide. Kinetic analysis indicated that CAD-1 exhibited a narrow substrate profile, hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin with catalytic efficiencies of 6,600, 3,200, and 2,900 mM(-1) s(-1), respectively. The enzyme did not interact with oxyiminocephalosporins, imipenem, or aztreonam. CAD-1 was inhibited by tazobactam (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 0.27 microM), clavulanic acid (IC(50) = 4.7 microM), and sulbactam (IC(50) = 43.5 microM). The bla(CAD-1) gene is likely to have been acquired by BM4489 and BM4490 as part of a mobile genetic element, since it was not found in the susceptible type strain CIP 101029 and was adjacent to a gene for a resolvase."

CD011926,0,25500182,0,Evaluation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) direct antigen detection assays for use in point-of-care testing.,"RSV infections cause lower respiratory tract infections and result in surges in physician's office, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, especially in infants and toddlers. Point-of-care (POC) testing reduces healthcare costs and permits informed decisions on treatment, however, optimal POC assays must be sensitive, easy to perform and provide rapid results. A prospective study tested 230 patient nasopharyngeal specimens using 4 RSV direct antigen detection assays (Directigen, Quickvue, Sofia and Veritor) and RT-PCR. A RSV dilution study was also performed to evaluate sensitivity. RSV fluorescent antibody testing in 46/230 patients was also evaluated. Sensitivity values obtained for the Sofia, Veritor, Directigen and Quickvue assays (%) were 85, 72.5, 70 and 57.5, respectively. Fluorescent result interpretation may account for Sofia's enhanced sensitivity. Specificity (%) was 97-100 among assays. Sensitivity data were confirmed in the dilution studies. Fluorescent antibody testing demonstrated 64% sensitivity compared with RT-PCR. Objective result reporting, walk away testing and high sensitivity make the Sofia a valuable choice for POC testing. Veritor's sensitivity may also render it acceptable in POC. Lack of objective results by Directigen and the poor sensitivity observed by Quickvue may preclude their value in diagnostic testing."
CD011926,0,21345533,0,[Microbiological diagnosis of central nervous system infections].,"The infections of the central nervous system are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Several agents including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa can invade the CNS. They are different clinical presentations of these infections: meningitis, encephalitis, brain and epidural abscesses and cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections. The clinical course could be acute, subacute or chronic depending on the infecting agent and the location of the infection. The travelling entails a risk of infection by exotic agents of meningo-encephalitis such as robovirus and arbovirus, which require new diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Despite some progress in the treatment of the CNS infections, the mortality is usually high. Rapid diagnosis and emergent interventions are necessary to improve the outcome of those patients, and early and targeted antimicrobial treatment and support measures are of paramount importance for a favourable clinical patient outcome. The antigen detection techniques and particularly those of genetic diagnosis by amplification (PCR and others) have advanced, and improved the diagnostic of those diseases. In this paper the clinical signs and symptoms and diagnostic procedures of CNS infections are presented."

A total of 2,645 rotavirus strains from pediatric patients with acute diarrhea were collected over three consecutive seasons from September 2006 through August 2009, and partially characterized by standardized multiplex RT-PCR. Most of strains (89.1%) belonged to genotypes G1-G4, and G9, associated with either P[8] or P[4], commonly found in humans worldwide. However, in at least 2.0% of cases, viruses exhibited either a G or P type typical of animal viral strains, suggesting gene reassortment events between rotaviruses of different origin. Mixed infections with two or more rotavirus strains were observed frequently (7.6% of patients), and depended on the frequencies of co-circulating rotaviruses of one particular genotype. The numbers and genotypes of likely natural reassortants of common genotype rotaviruses were found to be correlated with the observed numbers and genotypes of mixed infections. Large variation in the relative frequency of different rotavirus genotypes was observed between different seasons and/or areas of Italy, suggesting independent evolution or differential introduction of viral strains with respect to both time and space."

CD011926,0,24576998,0,Bloodstream infections by Malassezia and Candida species in critical care patients.,"Despite being considered an emerging yeast related to immunocompromised individuals, severe infections by Malassezia furfur have not been evaluated. During a one-year survey on yeasts fungemia, 290 neonatal and 17 pediatric patients with intravascular catheters, lipid parenteral nutrition, prolonged ward stay, and surgery were enrolled. In addition, the origin of the infection was investigated by swabbing hand skin of patients, parents, and healthcare workers and medical devices. All biological specimens and swabs were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and Dixon agar. The yeasts identification was based on morphological and biochemical features and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and confirmed by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA. A higher prevalence of M. furfur (2.1%) over Candida spp. (1.4%) caused bloodstream infections (BSIs). Twelve fungemia episodes were recorded: 2 by M. furfur in a pediatric ward and 10 in a neonatal intensive care unit (6 caused by M. furfur and 4 by Candida spp.). M. furfur was also isolated from the skin of all patients with BSIs, from the hand skin of a parent, and from an incubator surface and sheet. Patients with Candida spp. and M. furfur BSIs were successfully treated with intravenous liposomal Amphotericin B. These findings highlight the need for a more accurate etiological diagnosis in high-risk patients by adding lipid-supplemented culture media for Malassezia in the current mycological routine as the clinical features, patient management, and outcomes in both Candida and Malassezia fungemia do not differ."
CD011926,0,7751380,0,Development of PCR for screening of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.,"In this study, we determined the sequence of the EcoRI-PstI fragment of the plasmid pCVD432, also termed the enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) probe. A primer pair complementary to this probe was designed for PCR amplification of a 630-bp region. Comparison of the analysis of the EAggEC probe sequence with those in database libraries revealed no significant similarity to any known bacterial gene. Pure cultures of E. coli cells, as well as mixed cultures from stool specimens, were investigated with the PCR assay, the EAggEC probe test, and the adherence test. Of 50 E. coli strains which demonstrated aggregative adherence to HEp-2 cells, 43 (86%) were positive with the EAggEC PCR. All 43 of these strains reacted with the EAggEC probe. Six EAggEC strains gave negative results by both molecular techniques. In contrast, only 4 of 418 (0.96%) strains representing other categories of diarrheagenic E. coli demonstrated a positive PCR result. The PCR was also successful in screening for the presence of EAggEC in enriched cultures grown from stool specimens. Compared with cell culture assays and colony hybridization, our findings revealed that the PCR assay was more rapid, simple, and highly sensitive and can therefore be recommended as a screening method for EAggEC in the clinical laboratory."

These isolates were assumed to be of the same clone because they were characterized by the same antimicrobial susceptibility and pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns. It was established that the drug resistance was attributed to overproduction of chromosomally encoded Kl beta-lactamase. It was determined that an isolate (K. oxytoca H1) contained a high enzyme concentration (27microg/100microg of protein in enzyme extracts), at least 27 times higher than the control K. oxytoca N1. It was also demonstrated that isolates had a point mutation in the - 35 concensus region of the promotor gene of bla(OXY-2)leading to enzyme overproduction.

However, there is increasing evidence that these organisms can also cause gastrointestinal and ocular infections in immunocompetent individuals. In Korea, there have been no reports on human infections with microsporidia to date. In the present study, we used real-time PCR and nucleotide sequencing to detect Encephalitozoon intestinalis infection in seven of 139 human diarrheal stool specimens (5%) and Encephalitozoon hellem in three of 34 farm soil samples (8.8%). Genotype analysis of the E. hellem isolates based on the internal transcribed spacer 1 and polar tube protein genes showed that all isolates were genotype 1B. To our knowledge, this is the first report on human E. intestinalis infection in Korea and the first report revealing farm soil samples as a source of E. hellem infection.

G3 was found to be the prevalent VP7 serotype during the first year, being superseded by serotype G1 strains during the second season. To antigenically characterize the VP4 protein of the strains isolated, we used five neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which showed specificity for VP4 serotypes P1A, P1B, and P2 in earlier studies. Eight different patterns of reactivity with these MAbs were found, and the prevalence of three of these patterns varied from one season to the next. The P genotype of a subset of 52 samples was determined by PCR. Among the strains characterized as genotype P[4] and P[8] there were three and five different VP4 MAb reactivity patterns, respectively, indicating that the diversity of neutralization epitopes in VP4 is greater than that previously appreciated by the genomic typing methods."

We have compared PCR with other diagnostic methods for perinatal HIV-1 infection and have attempted also to identify maternal markers which correlate with risk of transmission. PCR was the most sensitive method for early diagnosis of perinatal transmission of HIV-1, but the PCR-positive children (n = 11) developed at least one additional sign of infection. The PCR-negative children (n = 76) were clinically healthy, virus isolation negative, and their serum was HIV-1-antigen-negative. All children who had become seronegative (n = 36) were both PCR- and isolation-negative. Antigenaemia in the mothers correlated significantly with higher risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1, while no other parameters (clinical stage, lymphocyte subsets, PCR and isolation) showed such a correlation. This indicates that the level of virus expression may be of key importance for the risk of vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection."

In 2000 and 2005, two large outbreaks of Echovirus 30 (a member of species human enterovirus B) were observed in the University Hospitals of Marseilles (France). Between the two epidemics, the diagnostic protocols for enterovirus infection were modified, moving from viral cultures and classic RT-PCR in 2000 to real-time RT-PCR in 2005. We compared some viral and epidemiological characteristics of the 2000 and 2005 outbreaks with special attention to diagnostic procedures and to the subsequent clinical management of patients. Despite similar virological and epidemiological characteristics during both outbreaks, our results show that real-time RT-PCR techniques used in 2005 noticeably shortened the period of time necessary to deliver diagnostic results and suggest that this was associated with a decrease in the duration of hospitalization for positive cases. In conclusion, this study suggests that the improvement of enterovirus diagnosis had a major financial impact on the management of the 2005 epidemic in Marseilles and may constitute an interesting example of how new diagnostic methods in microbiology can be self-financed through improvement in patient management."

CD011926,0,24859529,0,Early development of broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1-infected infants.,"Eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against HIV-1 is daunting because of the extensive genetic and antigenic diversity of HIV-1. Moreover, broad and potent responses are uncommon even during persistent infection, with only a subset of adults developing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that recognize viral variants from different HIV-1 clades. It is not known whether bNAbs can also arise in HIV-1-infected infants, who typically progress to disease faster than adults, presumably in part due to an immature immune system. Here, we show that bNAbs develop at least as commonly in infants as in adults. Cross-clade NAb responses were detected in 20/28 infected infants, in some cases within 1 year of infection. Among infants with breadth of responses within the top quartile, neutralization of tier 2 or 3 variants from multiple clades was detected at 20 months after infection. These findings suggest that, even in early life, there is sufficient B cell functionality to mount bNAbs against HIV-1. Additionally, the relatively early appearance of bNAbs in infants may provide a unique setting for understanding the pathways of B cell maturation leading to bNAbs."

The study group included 412 children under 6 years with diarrhoea who were either hospitalised, or seen in the outpatients department of The Sydney Children's Hospital. Pathogens were detected in 137 (33%) samples, with rotavirus most common (40%), followed by adenovirus (26%), astrovirus (12%), Campylobacter jejuni (12%), Salmonella spp. (10%) and Giardia lamblia (< 1 %). Giardia-specific antigen (GSA) was detected in 11 of 382 (3%) using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and this included four samples in which cysts of G. lamblia were detected by microscopy. Using electron microscopy (EM), viruses were detected in 29 of 120 (24%) samples from hospitalised children and 53 of 171 (31%) outpatients (P = 0.23). Amongst this subset, Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) were detected by RT-PCR in 10 samples including six of 14 with small round viruses, one of seven with small viral-like particles (SVLPs), and three of 126 EM-negative samples. Lactoferrin, detected by EIA, was 59% more likely to be positive in samples infected with salmonella/campylobacter than in samples in which bacterial pathogens were not isolated. As an indicator for infection with these bacterial agents, the assay showed a sensitivity and specificity of 95 and 40.3%, respectively. A routine microbiological analysis of stools from children of this age group should include a screen for foodborne bacterial agents and rotavirus. Tests for adenovirus, astrovirus and NLVs should be secondary. The cost-effectiveness of including the EIAs for lactoferrin and G. lamblia in the routine testing protocol needs to be evaluated."

The HIV DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and was detected for C2V4 of HIV-1 env by nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR). One set was stored at -20 degrees C for 14 weeks, another at 37 degrees C for 1 week and then kept at -20 degrees C for 13 weeks and a third set at 25 degrees C for I week and then -20 degrees C for 13 weeks. The dried blood spots from each set were detected for the HIV DNA every 2 weeks for 14 weeks. The C2V4 region of HIV env DNA was determined from small amounts of the dried blood collected on the filter papers. The nested PCR procedure could detect as few as 5 copies of HIV proviral DNA, and HIV DNA could be detected from specimens with viral loads of 2x 10(4) copies/ml. HIV DNA could be detected from specimens collected at all temperatures tested for at least 14 weeks. Therefore, laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection can be done by PCR on dried blood spots. These techniques will be useful as a tool for studying the epidemiology of HIV infection among populations of interest such as mother to child infection using newborn screening specimens."
CD011926,0,10878046,1,Comparison of 16S rRNA gene PCR and BACTEC 9240 for detection of neonatal bacteremia.,"Ten percent of infants born in the United States are admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) annually. Approximately one-half of these admissions are from term infants (>34 weeks of gestation) at risk for systemic infection. Most of the term infants are not infected but rather have symptoms consistent with other medical conditions that mimic sepsis. The current standard of care for evaluating bacterial sepsis in the newborn is performing blood culturing and providing antibiotic therapy while awaiting the 48-h preliminary result of culture. Implementing a more rapid means of ruling out sepsis in term newborns could result in shorter NICU stays and less antibiotic usage. The purpose of this feasibility study was to compare the utility of PCR to that of conventional culture. To this end, a total of 548 paired blood samples collected from infants admitted to the NICU for suspected sepsis were analyzed for bacterial growth using the BACTEC 9240 instrument and for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using a PCR assay which included a 5-h preamplification culturing step. The positivity rates by culture and PCR were 25 (4.6%) and 27 (4.9%) positive specimens out of a total of 548 specimens, respectively. The comparison revealed sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 96.0, 99. 4, 88.9, and 99.8%, respectively, for PCR. In summary, this PCR-based approach, requiring as little as 9 h of turnaround time and blood volumes as small as 200 microl, correlated well with conventional blood culture results obtained for neonates suspected of having bacterial sepsis."
CD011926,0,20430185,0,Etiology of DNA virus infections in liver transplant recipients with neonatal hepatitis.,"Neonatal hepatitis is a syndrome of symptoms associated with a history that includes any type of infectious, genetic, toxic, or metabolic causation. Various infectious agents have been implicated in hepatic inflammation in neonates including bacterial and viral pathogens, especially DNA viruses. We used molecular and antigenic methods to evaluate the role of DNA viruses, such as hepatitis type B viruses (HBV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and adenovirus, in neonatal hepatitis complications. Twenty-six paraffin-embedded biopsy and autopsy tissues obtained between 1996 and 2007 from 22 infants with neonatal hepatitis were studied retrospectively. The genome prevalence of HBV, HCMV, HSV, and adenovirus were analysed using qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. The antigenic presentation of HSV-1, HSV-2, HBV, HCMV, and adenovirus were evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods. The HCMV genome was detected separately in 1 of 22 (4.5%) paraffin-embedded autopsy and biopsy tissues. Also 3/22 (13.6%) samples were infected with HBV and HSV genomes. HBV and HSV-1 antigens were present in 1/26 (4.5%) neonatal samples and HSV-2 antigens in 5/26 (22.7%) by IHC protocols, but adenovirus and HCMV antigens were not detected among samples from infants with neonatal hepatitis. Detection of separate co-infections of HSV, HCMV, and HBV genomes in autopsy and biopsy tissues of HBV and HSV-1 or HSV-2 antigens in these patients, showed the importance of these viral infections in clinical neonatal hepatitis."
CD011926,0,1814329,0,Non-isotopic polymerase chain reaction methods for the detection of HIV-1 in Ugandan mothers and infants.,"Two non-isotopic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were evaluated by testing blood from 41 HIV-1-seropositive and 16 HIV-1-seronegative Ugandan mothers and 56 of their children (aged 0.5-15.0 months). Amplification of HIV-1 sequences was performed in duplicate using a biotinylated primer pair to the gag region (SK 462-431) and nested primer pairs (JA 17-20) to the pol region of HIV-1. gag sequences were hybridized using a microtiter plate coated with the SK 102 probe followed by colorimetric detection using an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and tetramethylbenzidine/peroxide substrate. pol sequences were detected on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Results of HIV-1 PCR analysis showed that 40 out of 41 (98%) seropositive mothers and 10 out of 29 (34%) seropositive children had detectable HIV-1 gag and pol sequences. None of the 16 seronegative mothers nor 27 seronegative or Western blot-indeterminate children had detectable HIV-1 sequences. Our results suggest that non-isotopic PCR methods are sensitive, specific, and potentially useful in the early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in developed and developing countries."

Single primers were used to generate randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles from Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates of various serotype and K. pneumoniae isolates from cases of sepsis at a Malaysian hospital and two English hospitals. RAPD profiles of acceptable reproducibility, a maximum of three minor band variations, were produced using a rapid DNA extraction method. RAPD typing of K. pneumoniae was shown to be as discriminatory as restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using pulsed field gel electrophoresis yet quicker and less costly. The findings suggest that RAPD typing may be a useful tool for the epidemiological typing of K. pneumoniae."

CD011926,0,9099506,0,Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection.,"The incidence of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) and neonatal HSV infection is increasing in the United States. The risk to the neonate of a woman with genital recurrences (1%-3%) versus first-episode infection (30%-50%), even when asymptomatic, has been defined. Appreciation of the subtle clinical signs, as well as more obvious cutaneous signs of neonatal infection, will lead to appropriate diagnostic evaluation (including, at times, polymerase chain-reaction assay) and therapy. Understanding the immune defects predisposing the neonate to severe HSV infection will enhance efforts to reconstitute the neonate's immune function. Maternal vaccination, chemoprophylaxis, and appropriate use of cesarean-section delivery may prevent cases of neonatal herpes now and in the future."
CD011926,0,26182210,0,Genetic Variation of Bordetella pertussis in Austria.,"In Austria, vaccination coverage against Bordetella pertussis infections during infancy is estimated at around 90%. Within the last years, however, the number of pertussis cases has increased steadily, not only in children but also in adolescents and adults, indicating both insufficient herd immunity and vaccine coverage. Waning immunity in the host and/or adaptation of the bacterium to the immunised hosts could contribute to the observed re-emergence of pertussis. In this study we therefore addressed the genetic variability in B. pertussis strains from several Austrian cities. Between the years 2002 and 2008, 110 samples were collected from Vienna (n = 32), Linz (n = 63) and Graz (n = 15) by nasopharyngeal swabs. DNA was extracted from the swabs, and bacterial sequence polymorphisms were examined by MLVA (multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis) (n = 77), by PCR amplification and conventional Sanger sequencing of the polymorphic regions of the prn (pertactin) gene (n = 110), and by amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (ARMS-qPCR) (n = 110) to directly address polymorphisms in the genes encoding two pertussis toxin subunits (ptxA and ptxB), a fimbrial adhesin (fimD), tracheal colonisation factor (tcfA), and the virulence sensor protein (bvgS). Finally, the ptxP promoter region was screened by ARMS-qPCR for the presence of the ptxP3 allele, which has been associated with elevated production of pertussis toxin. The MLVA analysis revealed the highest level of polymorphisms with an absence of MLVA Type 29, which is found outside Austria. Only Prn subtypes Prn1/7, Prn2 and Prn3 were found with a predominance of the non-vaccine type Prn2. The analysis of the ptxA, ptxB, fimD, tcfA and bvgS polymorphisms showed a genotype mixed between the vaccine strain Tohama I and a clinical isolate from 2006 (L517). The major part of the samples (93%) displayed the ptxP3 allele. The consequences for the vaccination strategy are discussed."
CD011926,0,23785756,0,[The effect of viral infections on the cytokine profile in pregnant women with obstetric complications and immunotherapy with human alpha2b interferon].,"The goal of this work was to examine the effects of infections caused by HSV1/2, CMV, and HPV on the cytokine profile in pregnant women with obstetric complications (OC) and to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy with recombinant human alpha2b interferon. Direct markers of the viruses were identified using PCR and rapid culture method in 85 pregnant women divided into 3 groups: group 1 (n = 21), women with visual HPV-related clinical manifestations; group 2 (n = 48), with detectable markers of viral infections and no clinical manifestations, and group 3 consisting of pregnant women with OC without markers and clinical manifestations of viral infections (n = 16). The rate of HPV DNA detection in pregnant women was higher than that of herpesviruses (HV) CMV and/ or HSV: 37.6% vs. 11.8%. The frequency of mixed HV/HPV infection in group 1 was 2.3-fold higher than in group 2. The cytokine levels of IFNalpha, IFNgamma, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFalpha in blood plasma and vaginal washings were studied. Statistically significant differences in infected women (groups 1 and 2) in comparison with uninfected women (group 3) were detected: a) blood plasma concentration of IFNgamma increased in clinically manifested HPV infection; b) blood plasma IL-8 concentration increased in clinically manifested HPV and in mixed HV+HPV infections without clinical symptoms of HPV infection; c) blood plasma concentration of TNFalpha increased in women with asymptomatic HPV-infection; d) IL-6 concentration in vaginal washings increased in mixed infection in group 1. The effect of IFN-alpha2b was assessed by analyzing cytokine levels in women on basic therapy with and without Viferon. In infected women, Viferon caused a 2-3-fold decrease in the concentrations of IFNgamma and IL-8 in blood plasma, thus bringing them near those of uninfected women with OC. The analysis of the state of newborns health has shown that for women with OC the risk of giving birth to a child in critical condition is 4.3-fold higher when CMV is detected in the third trimester of pregnancy."

CD011926,0,20038705,0,Genes involved in yellow pigmentation of Cronobacter sakazakii ES5 and influence of pigmentation on persistence and growth under environmental stress.,"Cronobacter spp. are opportunistic food-borne pathogens that are responsible for rare but highly fatal cases of meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates. While the operon responsible for yellow pigmentation in Cronobacter sakazakii strain ES5 was described recently, the involvement of additional genes in pigment expression and the influence of pigmentation on the fitness of Cronobacter spp. have not been investigated. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify further genes involved in pigment expression in Cronobacter sakazakii ES5 and to assess the influence of pigmentation on growth and persistence under conditions of environmental stress. A knockout library was created using random transposon mutagenesis. The screening of 9,500 mutants for decreased pigment production identified 30 colorless mutants. The mapping of transposon insertion sites revealed insertions in not only the carotenoid operon but also in various other genes involved in signal transduction, inorganic ions, and energy metabolism. To determine the effect of pigmentation on fitness, colorless mutants (DeltacrtE, DeltacrtX, and DeltacrtY) were compared to the yellow wild type using growth and inactivation experiments, a macrophage assay, and a phenotype array. Among other findings, the colorless mutants grew at significantly increased rates under osmotic stress compared to that of the yellow wild type while showing increased susceptibility to desiccation. Moreover, DeltacrtE and DeltacrtY exhibited increased sensitivity to UVB irradiation."

DNA from 22 strains of both CDC groups showed 69 to 96% relatedness (hydroxyapatite method) to labeled DNA from ATCC 49369 and to DNA from CDC group 3 strain G4964, and the strains are considered to belong to D. hominis. The remaining eight strains were genetically but not phenotypically differentiable from D. hominis. They were genetically heterogeneous, but hybridization results indicated that they probably belong to the genus Dermabacter. Thirteen of the 22 D. hominis strains and all 8 of the other Dermabacter strains had been isolated from blood, which indicates the pathogenic potential of this species and genus."
CD011926,0,22495561,0,Macrolide resistance determination and molecular typing of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in respiratory specimens collected between 1997 and 2008 in The Netherlands.,"An important role in the treatment regimens for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections is played by macrolide (ML) antibiotics. In the past few years, however, a steady increase has been detected in the worldwide prevalence of ML-resistant (ML(r)) M. pneumoniae strains. It is obvious that this increase necessitates a continuous monitoring of ML(r) and, when detected, modification of antibiotic treatment modalities. Previously, we developed a pyrosequencing-based assay system for the genetic determination of ML(r) as well as molecular typing of M. pneumoniae. In this study, the sensitivity of this system was improved by the inclusion of a nested-PCR protocol. The modified system was applied to 114 M. pneumoniae-positive specimens that were obtained from a collection of 4,390 samples from patients with acute respiratory tract infections. These samples were collected between 1997 and 2008 in The Netherlands. The pyrosequencing system produced reliable data in 86% of the specimens that contained >500 M. pneumoniae genome copies/ml of patient sample. Each of these samples contained DNA of the ML-sensitive genotype. While 43% of the samples were found to harbor the M. pneumoniae subtype 1 genotype, 57% contained the subtype 2 genotype. We conclude that the pyrosequencing-based assay system is a useful tool for ML(r) determination and molecular typing of M. pneumoniae in patient samples. ML(r)-associated M. pneumoniae genotypes, however, were not found in the current study population."

During 2 months, 3 premature babies were treated with nosocomial infection caused by A. ursingii at the same ward, and on the basis of molecular typing results the same strain was responsible for all of these cases. Traditional biochemical methods and automatic identification systems failed to identify this bacterium on the species level, and only 16S rDNA sequencing gave acceptable species identifications. The isolated strains proved to be susceptible to all of the tested antimicrobials, including ampicillin/sulbactam, doxycyclin, netilmicin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, trimethoprim/sulfametoxazole, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and levofloxacin according to the CLSI standard.

One of 3 neonates died, the others recovered and were discharged home after several months of hospitalization."
CD011926,0,11724845,0,Detection and differentiation of human polyomaviruses JC and BK by LightCycler PCR.,"Human polyomaviruses JC and BK may cause several clinical manifestations in immunocompromised hosts, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and hemorrhagic cystitis. Molecular detection by PCR is recognized as a sensitive and specific method for detecting human polyomaviruses in clinical samples. In this study, a real-time PCR assay using the LightCycler platform was evaluated and compared to an ""in-house"" PCR assay using a conventional detection method. A total of 122 urine specimens were tested, and human polyomavirus was detected in 49 specimens (40%) by both conventional PCR and LightCycler PCR. The remaining 73 specimens (60%) were found negative by both assays. For 46 of the 49 positive specimens, LightCycler PCR and conventional PCR identified the same polyomavirus type. These samples included 30 samples with JC virus (JCV), 14 samples with BK virus (BKV), and 2 samples in which both viruses were detected. In the remaining three samples, both JCV and BKV were detected by the conventional assay, but only JCV was detected by the LightCycler assay. The results of this study show that the LightCycler PCR assay displays sensitivity and specificity similar to those of a conventional PCR assay. These data, combined with its rapid turnaround time for results and decreased hands-on time, make the LightCycler PCR assay highly suitable for the rapid detection and differentiation of JCV and BKV in the clinical laboratory."

This proinflammatory response leads to a loss of epithelial barrier function and atrophy of the intestine. Although the underlying mechanisms are unknown, a potential contributing factor is the impact PN has on the intestinal microbiome. We recently identified a shift in the intestinal microbial community in mice given PN; however, it is unknown whether such changes occur in humans. We hypothesized that similar microbial changes occur in humans during periods of enteral nutrient deprivation."
CD011926,0,25213851,0,Loss of detectability and indeterminate results: Challenges facing HIV infant diagnosis in South Africa's expanding ART programme.,"Early infant diagnosis with rapid access to treatment has been found to reduce HIV-associated infant mortality and morbidity considerably. In line with international standards, current South African guidelines advocate routine HIV-1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at 6 weeks of age for all HIV-exposed infants and 'fast-track' entry into the HIV treatment programme for those who test positive. Importantly, testing occurs within the context of increasing efforts at prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) by means of maternal and infant antiretroviral therapy (ART). In addition, infants already initiated on combination ART (cART) may be retested with PCR assays for 'confirmatory' purposes, including assessment prior to adoption. The potential for cART to compromise the sensitivity of HIV-1 PCR assays has been described, although there are limited and conflicting data regarding the effect of PMTCT regimens on HIV-1 PCR diagnostic sensitivity."
CD011926,0,7656759,0,Neonatal adenovirus infection: a case report with in situ hybridization confirmation of ascending intrauterine infection.,"Adenovirus infection is a rare, but serious infection, during the neonatal period. The actual model of infection at birth is currently unknown, however, several mechanisms have been proposed. We describe a case of fatal neonatal adenovirus pneumonia in a 25-wk gestational age infant. Adenovirus was confirmed by electron microscopy and by in situ hybridization. The maternal cervical/endocervical smear taken prior to the delivery contained epithelial cells with changes suggestive of adenovirus, which was confirmed by in situ hybridization on the smear. These findings suggest that ascending viral infection is a factor in the pathogenesis of neonatal adenovirus infection. The identification and reporting of adenovirus may be important during pregnancy in order to avoid delay in delivery of the fetus once membranes have ruptured."

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether screening with the use of IgG avidity and multiplex nested PCR methods was effective to detect a high-risk pregnancy. In a prospective study, serum T. gondii IgG avidity was measured in consecutive 146 pregnant women testing positive for T. gondii antibody and either positive or equivocal for IgM. Multiplex nested PCR for T. gondii DNA on amniotic fluid, maternal blood, and umbilical cord blood were performed with informed consent. A total of 51 (34.9%) women presented with low IgG avidity (<30%), 15 (10.3%) presented with borderline avidity (30 to 35%), and 80 (54.8%) presented with high avidity (>35%) indices. Amniotic fluid obtained at amniocentesis or birth yielded positive PCR results in nine women with low IgG avidity indices. Of these nine women, three had congenital toxoplasmosis. None of women with high or border line IgG avidity indices had a positive PCR result in the amniotic fluid or congenital toxoplasmosis. No congenital toxoplasmosis was detected in women whose amniotic fluids yielded negative PCR results. Ingestion of raw or undercooked meat was found to be the main risk factor for acute T. gondii infection. Congenital toxoplasmosis screening with a combination of IgG avidity in the maternal blood and multiplex nested PCR in the amniotic fluid was useful for detecting a high risk pregnancy and diagnosing congenital toxoplasmosis."
CD011926,0,25034127,0,Concordance between allele-specific PCR and ultra-deep pyrosequencing for the detection of HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutations.,"Recent advances in genotyping technologies have allowed for detection of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations present at low levels. The presence and percentage of Y181C and K103N drug-resistant variants in the blood of 105 subtype C HIV-infected infants who failed single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis for HIV transmission were compared using two highly sensitive genotyping methods, allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) and ultra-deep pyrosequencing. Significant correlations in detection between both methods were found for both Y181C (correlation coefficients of 0.94 [95% CI 0.91-0.96]) and K103N (0.89 [95% CI 0.84-0.92]) mutations. The majority of discordant specimens (3/5 Y181C and 8/11 K103N) had wild-type variants when population sequencing was used, but mutant variants were detectable at very low levels (≤5%) with either assay. This difference is most likely due to stochastic variations in the appearance of mutant variants. Overall, both AS-PCR and ultra-deep pyrosequencing methods have proven to be sensitive and accurate, and may confidently be used where feasible."
CD011926,0,15537252,0,[Congenital cytomegalovirus infection--clinical characteristics including prenatal diagnosis].,"Congenital infections are the important cause of morbidity and mortality of newborn infants. Among them, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the frequent congenital injection worldwide with the incidence 0.3-2.2% of live births. The virus can be transmitted to the foetus through primary (in 30 to 40%) or secondary (rare) maternal infection. 90% of infants with congenital infection have no signs or symptoms at birth. The other 10% will be symptomatic and about half of the will have the classic stigmata of CMV inclusion disease. Ten to thirty percent of the severely affected infants will die, more then 90% of survivors will have neurological handicaps, sensorineural hearing loss, chorioretinitis. Ten to 15% of children asymptomatic at birth have a risk of abnormal development and 10% develop hearing loss during the first years of life. Prenatal detection of congenital disease by ultrasound examination is not sufficient, but prenatal diagnosis can be confirmed by amniocentesis (culture of amniotic fluid and detection of virus DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reactions). However, the number of mothers who underwent amniocentesis and the broad case definition used to define symptomatic disease is still not adequate. Because there is currently no treatment for prenatal infection, early diagnosis of congenital infection during neonatal period is important (the possibility of antiviral treatment of children with symptomatic congenital disease and long-term follow-up). The best hope for eliminating congenital CMV infection is to prevent prenatal infection: with no vaccine, good hygiene and handwashing should be promoted."

Of 88 fecal specimens from infants with acute gastroenteritis, 2.3% (2) were found to be positive for sapovirus. Twenty-two of 833 (2.6%) fecal specimens collected from asymptomatic infants were also infected with this virus. Another interesting feature was the demonstration of high incidence of sapovirus infection (95.5%, 21 of 22) identified in a single day care center, which was not due to viral shedding after the latest acute gastroenteritis. Sapovirus was subjected to genetic analysis by sequencing. Up to 4 of 24 sapoviruses (16.7%) were clustered into genogroup IV known as a rare group. Remarkably, majority (79.2%, 19 of 24) of sapovirus isolates detected in this study turned out to present one novel sapovirus genotype tentatively called GI/8. It was noteworthy to point out that the GI/8 sapovirus infection was apparently confined only within the period of 9 weeks (44th through 52nd weeks). This pattern of infection implied the outbreak of asymptomatic GI/8 sapovirus infection in these subjects. The findings clearly indicate genogroup I sapovirus can be classified into eight genotypes. This is the first report to underscore that sapovirus pathogen causes not only clinical manifestations of acute gastroenteritis but also asymptomatic infection in infants in day care centers in Japan."

CD011926,0,11709331,0,"Prevalence and mechanisms of macrolide resistance in invasive and noninvasive group B streptococcus isolates from Ontario, Canada.","Macrolide resistance has been demonstrated in group B streptococcus (GBS), but there is limited information regarding mechanisms of resistance and their prevalence. We determined these in GBS obtained from neonatal blood cultures and vaginal swabs from pregnant women. Of 178 isolates from cases of neonatal GBS sepsis collected from 1995 to 1998, 8 and 4.5% were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively, and one isolate showed intermediate penicillin resistance (MIC, 0.25 microg/ml). Of 101 consecutive vaginal or rectal/vaginal isolates collected in 1999, 18 and 8% were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively. Tetracycline resistance was high (>80%) among both groups of isolates. Of 32 erythromycin-resistant isolates, 28 possessed the erm methylase gene (7 ermB and 21 ermTR/ermA) and 4 harbored the mefA gene; one isolate harbored both genes. One isolate which was susceptible to erythromycin but resistant to clindamycin (MIC, 4 microg/ml) was found to have the linB gene, previously identified only in Enterococcus faecium. The mreA gene was found in all the erythromycin-resistant strains as well as in 10 erythromycin-susceptible strains. The rate of erythromycin resistance increased from 5% in 1995-96 to 13% in 1998-99, which coincided with an increase in macrolide usage during that time."

The study objective was to define the various epidemiological aspects of the isolation of these strains in comparison to cases of isolation of imipenem-susceptible Enterobacter (ISE) strains. Molecular analysis of IRE strains included genotyping and defining the presence of carbapenemases. We conducted a matched retrospective case-control study of patients hospitalized from April 2003 to December 2006. Each IRE case was matched with an ISE case by age and source of isolation. A multivariate analysis using conditional logistic regression was performed to compare the two patient groups. There were 33 cases of IRE isolations during the study period. Twenty isolates were analyzed and found to belong to three distinct pulsotypes. Cell extracts of all of these isolates hydrolyzed imipenem. PCR and sequencing revealed that these isolates harbored a KPC-2 gene. In multivariate analysis, a high invasive-device score (P = 0.02) remained a predictor of IRE isolation. The mortality in the IRE group was 33%, compared to 9% among controls. Being an IRE case was significantly associated with increased mortality after controlling for confounders in a multivariate model (odds ratio, 8.3 +/- 8.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 64; P = 0.043). Resistance to imipenem due to bla(KPC-2) among Enterobacter isolates has occurred in several clones in Tel Aviv, affecting particularly patients with multiple invasive devices compared to ISE controls. IRE infections are associated with increased mortality. Enhanced measures to control the hospital spread of IRE are warranted."
CD011926,0,9650943,0,Molecular epidemiology of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from clinical specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis and associated environmental samples.,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was isolated from the respiratory tracts of 41 (25%) of 163 children attending our pediatric cystic fibrosis unit between September 1993 and December 1995. The extents of S. maltophilia contamination of environmental sites frequented by these patients were investigated with a selective medium incorporating vancomycin, imipenem, and amphotericin B. Eighty-two isolates of S. maltophilia were cultured from 67 different environmental sites sampled between January and July 1996. The organism was widespread in the home environment, with 20 (36%) and 25 (42%) of sampled sites positive in the homes of colonized and noncolonized patients, respectively. In the nosocomial setting, it was isolated from 18 (32%) sites in the hospital ward and from 4 (17%) sites in the outpatient clinic area. The most common sites of contamination were sink drains, faucets, and other items frequently in contact with water. All environmental and clinical isolates were genotyped with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences as primers. A total of 33 of the 41 patients were colonized with unique strains, and four pairs of patients shared strains. Further characterization by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis after digestion with XbaI found that there was no evidence of patient-to-patient transmission; however, there was some evidence that a small number of patients may have acquired the organism from the hospital environment. Resampling of environmental sites in the hospital ward in January 1997 revealed evidence of genetic drift, complicating the accurate determination of environmental sources for clinical strains. The source of the majority of S. maltophilia strains colonizing the respiratory tracts of these patients with cystic fibrosis remained uncertain but may have represented multiple, independent acquisitions from a variety of environmental sites both within and outside the hospital."
CD011926,0,20519460,0,Diversity of Escherichia coli strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Spain: second nationwide study.,"The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC) in Spain increased 8-fold from 2000 to 2006. ESBL type, clonal relationship, antimicrobial susceptibility, and clinical data about infections caused by ESBLEC are evaluated in a second nationwide study developed in 2006. From 1008 clinical isolates obtained over 2 months from 44 hospitals, 254 were used for further analysis. ESBL production was evaluated by synergy testing, PCR, and sequencing. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by microdilution. The clonal relationship was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (REP-PCR). The O25b subtype and the new afa operon FM955459 were determined by triplex PCR in isolates producing CTX-M-15. Multilocus sequence typing was performed on these isolates. A total of 72% of all ESBLs were of the CTX-M type, 26.8% were of the SHV type, and 1.2% were of the TEM type. The most prevalent ESBLs were CTX-M-14 (119 isolates), SHV-12 (68 isolates), CTX-M-15 (37 isolates), and CTX-M-9 (21 isolates). By REP-PCR, 214 clones were detected. All but five CTX-M-15 ESBLEC isolates corresponded to the international O25b/ST131 clone. This clone had not been detected in the first study (published in 2000). Epidemiological and clinical features were studied in 304 representative patients. A total of 60% of the patients were older than 60 and had nonfatal underlying diseases, and 55% had recently received antibiotics. Urinary tract infections accounted for 71% of cases, and 9% were bacteremic. There has been a significant increase in the prevalence of ESBLEC in Spain, with most of these strains being CTX-M-producing isolates, including the pandemic O25b-ST131. SHV-12-producing E. coli remains an important cause of community-acquired infection."

Herein we characterized the human neonatal thymic DC extracted from the organ in relationship with the DC generated from CD34+ cells in situ. We show that in vivo thymic DC express E cadherin, CLA, CD4, CD38, CD40, CD44, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-R (GM-CSF-R; CD116) but no CD1a. According to their morphology, functions, and surface staining they could be separated into two distinct subpopulations: mature HLA-DRhi, mostly interleukin-3-R (CD123)-negative cells, associated with thymocytes, some apoptotic, and expressed myeloid and activation markers but no lymphoid markers. In contrast, immature HLA-DR+ CD123hi CD36+ cells with monocytoid morphology lacked activation and myeloid antigens but expressed lymphoid antigens. The latter express pTalpha mRNA, which is also found in CD34+ thymocytes and in blood CD123hi DC further linking this subset to lymphoid DC. However, the DC generated from CD34+ thymic progenitors under standard conditions were pTalpha-negative. Thymic lymphoid DC showed similar phenotype and cytokine production profile as blood/tonsillar lymphoid DC but responded to GM-CSF, and at variance with them produced no or little type I interferon upon infection with viruses and did not induce a strict polarization of naive T cells into TH2 cells. Their function in the thymus remains therefore to be elucidated."

Sixty isolates of Staphylococcus capitis obtained from blood cultures of neonates between 2000 and 2005 were examined in this study. Biochemical analysis confirmed that 52 of these isolates belonged to the subsp. urealyticus, and the remaining 8 belonged to the subsp. capitis. Isolates of the predominant subsp. urealyticus clones were characterized by their resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and their biofilm formation ability, whereas subsp. capitis isolates were generally antibiotic susceptible and biofilm negative. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after SacII digestion separated the 60 isolates into five major clusters. Sequence analysis showed that, in S. capitis, the ica operon plus the negative regulator icaR was 4,160 bp in length. PCRs demonstrated the presence of the ica operon in all isolates. Further analysis of five isolates (two biofilm-positive subsp. urealyticus, one biofilm-negative subsp. urealyticus, and two biofilm-negative subsp. capitis) revealed that the ica operons were identical in all of the biofilm-positive subsp. urealyticus strains; however, the biofilm-negative isolates showed variations. The distinctive phenotypic and genotypic characteristics revealed by this study may affect the epidemiology of the two subspecies of S. capitis in the clinical setting. These results may provide a better understanding of the contribution of these two species to bloodstream infections in neonates."
CD011926,0,8809348,0,PCR diagnosis of viral pneumonitis from fixed-lung tissue in children.,"Viral infection in children commonly causes acute lung disease leading to respiratory decompensation requiring intensive supportive therapy. Definitive diagnosis of the causative virus may be difficult, relying on serologic data since viral cultures are frequently negative; lung biopsy may be necessary to increase the diagnostic yield. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analyzing Formalin-fixed lung tissue from autopsies of 32 patients with pneumonitis in whom cultures, serology, and histopathology results were blinded to the investigators, and 10 negative control samples, PCR was performed for cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Among the 32 affected specimens, 7 were culture-positive for a specific virus in the lung; 6/7 of these were PCR-positive for the identical virus. In the culture-positive specimen not PCR amplified, influenza B was the cultured agent, but this virus was not evaluated by PCR. In the remaining 25 samples which were culture-negative, 11 were PCR-positive. All 10 negative controls were negative by PCR. Three specimens with CMV inclusions but culture-negative were also negative by PCR. We conclude that PCR is sensitive and accurate in the evaluation of lung tissue for viral pneumonitis."

CD011926,0,19930846,0,Evaluation and comparison of three different anti-hepatitis C virus antibody tests based on chemiluminescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods used in the diagnosis of hepatitis C infections in Turkey.,"The routine diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is based on the detection of anti-HCV antibodies by two main methods (enzyme immunoassay [EIA] and chemiluminescence immunoassay [CIA]) but false-positives are a problem. We investigated three anti-HCV tests: two CIAs (Cobas e 601 and Architect i2000SR); and one EIA (Ortho HCV 3.0). Two other anti-HCV tests were also performed as supplementary and confirmatory tests, respectively: a recombinant strip immunoblot assay (RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA) and a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based assay for HCV-RNA. After discriminating the false-positive results, the true anti-HCV seropositivity rate in 7156 serum samples was 0.91%. The seropositivity and false-positive rates for the Cobas e 601, Architect i2000SR and Ortho HCV 3.0 anti-HCV tests were 1.9% and 0.99%, 1.2% and 0.29%, and 0.87% and 0.01%, respectively. The mean level of HCV-RNA was 3399 x 10(3) IU/ml. Critical levels for false-positivity for HCV-RNA were a cut-off index of 200 for Cobas e 601, a signal/cut-off (S/CO) of 5 for Architect i2000SR and an S/CO of 1.2 for Ortho HCV 3.0. Positive and negative results for the RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA assay all accorded with the HCV-RNA assay, except for 23 (17%) 'indeterminate' results, all of which were negative with the HCV-RNA assay. In conclusion, to eliminate doubts related to false-positive findings in the initial HCV screening tests, additional confirmatory HCV-RNA assay should be performed."

This study investigated the occurrence of five major DEC pathogroups in primary cultures of stool samples from 658 Burkinabe children under 5 years old using 16-plex PCR for virulence-associated genes. At least one DEC pathogroup was detected in 45% of 471 children with diarrhoea and in 29% of 187 children without diarrhoea (p <0.001). More than one DEC pathogroup was detected in 11% of children with and 1% of children without diarrhoea (p <0.001). Enteroaggregative E. coli was the most common pathogroup in both children with diarrhoea (26%) and children without diarrhoea (21%). Enteropathogenic E. coli and enterotoxigenic E. coli were detected significantly more often in children with diarrhoea (16% and 13%) than in children without diarrhoea (5% and 4%; p <0.001 for both pathogroups). Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and enteroinvasive E. coli were detected only in children with diarrhoea (2% and 1%, respectively).

Cross-resistance to other β-lactams was not found and their susceptibilities remained identical in consecutive isolates. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed to investigate the role of OprD, an outer membrane protein regulating the entry of carbapenems, in the appearance of carbapenem-resistant-only P. aeruginosa (CROPA). Fifteen paired isolates of carbapenem-susceptible P. aeruginosa (CS-PA) and CROPA were identified. All of the cases had carbapenem exposure history within 1 month before the appearance of CROPA (mean 10 days). Reduced OprD expression was found in 93% (14/15) of the isolates, suggesting that oprD inactivation was the major contributor to selective carbapenem resistance. Of the 14 cases with CROPA due to oprD mutation, 71% (10/14) were persistent infection, as genotype analysis revealed that their paired strains were isogenic; 29% (4/14) represented re-infections as they were heterogenic, suggesting that oprD-deficient CROPA existed in the hospital and that carbapenem selective pressure promoted its spread to patients. We conclude that CROPA may occur soon after the use of carbapenems to treat CS-PA infections and that oprD mutation is the major mechanism of resistance in CROPA. Restriction of empirical use of carbapenems by antibiotic stewardship is important to halt the occurrence of CROPA."
CD011926,0,20207094,0,The bacterial load of Ureaplasma parvum in amniotic fluid is correlated with an increased intrauterine inflammatory response.,"Ureaplasma spp. are the most frequently isolated microorganisms inside the amniotic cavity and have been associated with spontaneous abortion, chorioamnionitis, premature rupture of the membranes (PROM), and preterm labor (PL). We analyzed 118 samples from amniotic fluid of preterm infants before 34 weeks of gestation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Bacterial load, Ureaplasma biovar discrimination (Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum), and the level of inflammation were correlated with short-term clinical outcome. U. parvum was the predominant biovar, and increased bacterial load was significantly linked to histologic chorioamnionitis, PROM + PL, early-onset sepsis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the amount of U. parvum and the magnitude of inflammatory response inside the amniotic cavity observed by elevated interleukin 8 levels. We postulate that the bacterial load of Ureaplasma spp. measured by qPCR should be determined in studies investigating the potential clinical impact of intrauterine Ureaplasma spp. on the outcome of preterm infants."

Our patient was subjected to karyotype analysis and found to have full, non-mosaic trisomy 21 in both blood lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts, while examination of the term placenta, which was performed earlier in the course of a different study, had shown mosaicism (73%) for trisomy 21. FISH analysis showed no obvious rearrangement of the DS chromosomal region in any of the chromosomes 21. Molecular analysis using polymorphic markers on chromosome 21 verified the existence of trisomy for the entire long arm of the chromosome and showed that the origin of the extra chromosome was maternal and was probably the result of a mitotic error. In contrast with the above, the clinical evaluation using the Jackson checklist of 25 signs failed to establish the diagnosis of DS. We believe that our patient might present mosaicism in other tissues that are not available for analysis and can be regarded as an extreme example in the continuous spectrum of karyotype phenotype associations in mosaic cases."

The aim of the present study was to identify norovirus infections in children not infected by rotavirus admitted to hospital for acute gastroenteritis in Belém. A total of 348 fecal specimens were obtained from children with diarrhea aged less than 5 years, all of whom had tested negative for rotavirus, between May 2008 and April 2010. Fecal samples were screened for norovirus antigen using enzyme-immunoassay (EIA). Specimens were subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the primers Mon432/434-Mon431/433 for detection of the GI and GII norovirus strains, respectively. Based on both methods, the overall norovirus positivity rate was 36.5% (127/348). Of the 169 samples collected in the first year, 44.4% (n = 75) tested positive for norovirus using both methods, 35.5% (n = 60) by EIA and 40.8% (n = 69) by RT-PCR. Using RT-PCR as a reference standard, a sensitivity of 78.3%, specificity of 94%, and agreement of 87.6% were recorded. Genome sequencing was obtained for 22 (31.9%) of the 69 positive samples, of which 90.9% (20/22) were genotype GII.4d and 9.1% (2/22) were genotype GII.b. Norovirus infection was most frequent in children under 2 years of age (41.5%-115/277). The peak incidence (62.1%) of norovirus-related acute gastroenteritis in these patients (not infected by rotavirus) was observed in February 2010.

To determine bacterial load in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) we used semiquantitative culturing and quantitative TaqMan-PCR for those pathogens difficult to culture. Specimens and clinical data were obtained from 311 children between 0 and 16 years of age with LRTI during the period of 2006-2008. The most common detected potentially pathogenic colonisers were Haemophilus influenzae (32.1 %), Moraxella catharralis (26.7 %), Staphylococcus aureus (17.7 %) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.7 %). As expected S. aureus was the most common coloniser in children less than 4 months of age, whereas H. influenzae detection peaked in older children. Co-colonisation with other bacterial pathogens were more often observed in children with S. aureus (46 %) and S. pneumoniae (49 %) than in those with H. influenzae (30 %) or M. catharralis (27 %). Children with S. aureus co-colonisation had higher levels of C-reactive-protein, received antibiotics more frequently and stayed longer in hospital than those with S. aureus single colonisation. In contrast, children with H. influenzae, M. catharralis or S. pneumoniae colonisation suffered more often from pneumonia than children with S. aureus colonisation. Coloniser specific analysis of bacterial quantity revealed no significant reduction of the bacterial carriage from the first to the second NPA. No correlation of a high bacterial load and occurrence of pneumonia could be detected. In conclusion, clinical characteristics in children with LRTIs are associated with a specific bacterial set of colonisers detected in the nasopharynx rather than on their quantity."
CD011926,0,15288963,0,Few modifications of the Cobas Amplicor HIV Monitor 1.5 test allow reliable quantitation of HIV-1 proviral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,"Recent studies have suggested that monitoring the amount of HIV provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may be a useful end point for HAART where, in combination with plasma viral load, it provides additional information as to the possibility of virus eradication. In the present study, a modified version of the Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test (CAHIM), currently used to quantify plasma viremia, have been evaluated to also measure the amount of proviral DNA in PBMCs. The analytical and clinical performance of the modified CAHIM test was assessed by quantifying different amounts of a standard HIV-DNA preparation obtained from the 8E5 cell line and by analysing 165 patients and controls samples. In these experiments, the modified test, that showed a linear dynamic range from 1.7 to 4.7 log10 copies/10(6) cells (r = 0.99) with a maximum CV of 20%, proved able to detect and quantify HIV-DNA in all but one clinical samples, with concentrations varying from 1.3 to 3.8 log10 copies/10(6) cells. During anti-retroviral treatment, the assay revealed different proviral DNA time courses associated with viral load changes and inversely correlated with CD4+ cells count. As expected, HIV-DNA was always detectable even when plasma viremia fell below the CAHIM cut-off. The modified CAHIM test specificity was confirmed by testing 20 HIV-negative samples in triplicates. Taken together, the data showed that the modified CAHIM test can be used to monitor HIV proviral DNA changes during HAART and can help in investigating further the clinical use of this marker."

CD011926,0,19052076,0,Role of astrovirus in intussusception in Nigerian infants.,"Intussusception (IS) is a form of intestinal obstruction in which a segment of the bowel prolapses into a more distal segment. Viral infections, mostly adenovirus, enteroviruses, human herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus are reported in 20-50% of childhood cases of IS. Between January and July 2004, six stool specimens collected from infants 0- to 8-months old diagnosed and admitted for IS were investigated for the presence of rotavirus, astrovirus and adenovirus antigens. Astrovirus antigen was detected in three of the six stool specimens by enzyme immune assay (EIA) and confirmed in two specimens by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rotavirus, non-enteric adenovirus and astrovirus were detected by EIA, as mixed infections in a single specimen. The rotavirus strain revealed a SGI+II, mixed G1G2G8P[6] genotype and had no visible electrophoretic profile. A larger study is needed to determine the extent of involvement of astroviruses in IS in infants and the virus should be included in studies investigating the aetiology of IS."

HPeV3-infected patients (median age, 32 days; range, 4-113 days) were diagnosed as having sepsis (79%), sepsis-like syndrome (19%), or encephalitis with septic shock (2%). Other than fever, mottled skin (67%) was significantly more frequent in HPeV3-infected patients than other virus-infected patients (P = 0.005). The rate of HPeV3 RNA detection in CSF without pleocytosis was high (88%; 28/32). Among the 32 patients whose serum and CSF samples were available, all patients were positive for serum PCR; however, 4 (12%) patients were negative for CSF PCR. Serum HPeV3 RNA level on admission was associated with younger age (P = 0.002), bad temper (P = 0.041), and grunting (P = 0.008). Among 6 patients with sequential data on serum HPeV3 RNA level, levels decreased rapidly without specific therapy. In conclusion, serum samples at disease onset are the most useful compared to CSF in detection of HPeV RNA and serum HPeV3 RNA level on admission was associated with important clinical manifestations in HPeV3-infected patients."

The clinical records of the siblings were examined; the genes encoding surfactant protein B (SFTPB), surfactant protein C (SFTPC), and ATP-binding cassette transporter 3 protein (ABCA3) were analyzed with direct sequencing and Southern blotting. The infants were homozygous for a 5,983 bp deletion in ABCA3 including exons 2-5 as well as the start AUG codon and a putative Golgi exit signal motif. Dense abnormalities of lamellar bodies at electron microscopy and absence of ABCA3 at immunohistochemical staining were in agreement with the presence of two null alleles. In addition, an increased lipid synthesis suggested a compensatory mechanism. The clinical course in the two sisters was influenced by different environmental factors like the time needed for molecular confirmation, the ventilatory assistance adopted, the occurrence of infections. A less aggressive clinical approach did not improve the course of the disease; the prognosis was always poor.

Molecular assays for amplification and profiling of parasite minicircle DNA (kDNA) and identification of discrete typing units (DTUs) were prospectively conducted in bloodstream and placental samples from pregnant women cursing chronic Chagas disease residing in Buenos Aires city. Sensitivity of kDNA-PCR increased from 75.6% to 95.6% when one to three sequential blood samples were analysed. Congenital infection (CI) was diagnosed in 3 neonates born to kDNA-PCR positive mothers, one who had transmitted CI in a previous gestation, pointing to family clustering of congenital transmission. Fourteen of 44 placental samples were kDNA-PCR positive, all from non-CI transmitting women, indicating that placental PCR is not useful for CI diagnosis. Placental PCR positivity was not related to maternal bloodstream PCR positivity and placental parasitic subpopulations not observed in bloodstream were detected by minicircle signatures. PCR targeted to intergenic regions of spliced-leader genes and serological tests using trypomastigote small surface recombinant antigens showed predominance of DTU group TcII/V/VI and only one patient infected with TcI. To our knowledge, this is the first PCR-based follow-up study of bloodstream and placental T. cruzi infections during pregnancy, including identification of DTUs. kDNA-PCR assays in serial blood samples provided high sensitivity for detection of T. cruzi DNA in pregnant women with chronic Chagas disease."

CD011926,0,1987350,0,Comparison of HIV detection by virus isolation in lymphocyte cultures and molecular amplification of HIV DNA and RNA by PCR in offspring of seropositive mothers.,"An early and accurate diagnosis of HIV infection is needed in the offspring of seropositive mothers. To this end, we have used two techniques for the direct detection of HIV in 12 newborns tested within 2 weeks after birth and 12 children. HIV isolation was carried out in lymphocyte cocultures and compared with detection of DNA and RNA sequences by molecular amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In lymphocyte cocultures, HIV was isolated in 8 of 24 cases (33%), including 3 newborns, 3 symptomatic children, and 2 asymptomatic ones. HIV DNA was detected by PCR in twice as many cases, i.e., in 16/24 cases (66%), including 7/12 newborns, 4/4 symptomatic children, and 5/8 asymptomatic ones, 2 of whom became seronegative, HIV RNA was detected in 10 of 16 cases (60%) with detectable HIV DNA, including all of the cases who had a positive HIV isolation. Only children with clinical or biological signs of HIV infection were positive for HIV RNA. Furthermore, signs of HIV infection appeared within 6 months in three of the four newborns who were positive for HIV RNA at birth. These results indicate that HIV DNA detection by PCR is far more sensitive than HIV isolation in culture for the early diagnosis of HIV infection in offspring of seropositive mothers. HIV RNA detection appears to be a useful prognostic marker since it does correlate with disease progression and may serve as a clue for HIV replication in vivo."

This article will review our investigations and related studies, including our studies in monkeys, that have contributed to current diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease caused by GBS. Although it has not been possible to eradicate GBS colonization, intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis given during parturition has been effective in the prevention of vertical transmission in animals and humans. Recently, diagnostic tests with polymerase chain reaction have offered promise for rapid accurate detection. This could lead to a major shift in the timing of diagnosis from the office setting to delivery suite. The potential for immunization remains a challenge."

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has replaced chloroquine as first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria infection in Kenya but resistance to SP is already reported. The addition of artemisinin derivatives to SP may delay the development of drug resistance, improve cure rates, and reduce transmission. The efficacy and safety of artesunate plus SP in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria was evaluated in a randomized trial of 600 children at Siaya District Hospital, western Kenya between October 1999 and March 2000. Children aged < 5 years were randomly assigned to receive SP alone (1.25 mg/kg based on pyrimethamine), or in combination with artesunate (4 mg/kg/d) for either 1 or 3 d. Parasitological failure by days 14 and 28 (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-corrected for new infections) were the primary endpoints. Treatment failure rates by day 14 were 25.5% in the SP alone group, 16.2% (risk difference [delta]-9.3%, 95% CI -17.3 to -1.2%, P= 0.027) in the 1-dose artesunate group, and 9.4% (delta-16.2%, 95% CI -23.6 to -8.7%, P< 0.001) in the 3-dose artesunate group. Corresponding rates by day 28 were 46.0% in the SP alone group, 38.2% (delta-7.8%, 95% CI -17.7 to 2.1%, P= 0.16) in the 1-dose artesunate group, and 26.0% (delta-20.0%, 95% CI -29.4 to -10.6%, P < 0.001) in the 3-dose artesunate group. The artesunate and SP combination was well tolerated. There were no serious drug-related adverse events. Parasite clearance and gametocyte carriage were reduced significantly in both combination groups compared with SP alone.

EAEC isolates (n=86) recovered from diarrhoeal cases in human infants (37) and young animals (49) were characterized as 'typical' and/or 'atypical' EAEC strains employing PCR for virulence associated genes (cvd432, aaiA, astA, pilS, irp2, ecp, pic, aggR, aafA, aggA, and agg3A). Besides, biofilm formation ability of human and animal EAEC isolates was assessed using microtiter plate assay. In addition, the transcriptional profile of biofilm associated genes (fis and ecp) was also evaluated and correlated with biofilm formation assay for few selected EAEC isolates of human and animal origins. Overall, a diverse virulence gene profile was observed for the EAEC isolates of human and animal origins as none of the EAEC isolates revealed the presence of all the genes that were targeted. Nine 'typical' EAEC isolates were identified (6 from humans and 3 from animals) while, the majority of the isolates were 'atypical' EAEC strains. Isolation and identification of three 'typical' EAEC isolates from animals (canines) appears to be the first report globally. Further, based on the observations of the biofilm formation assay, the study suggested that human EAEC isolates in particular were comparatively more biofilm producers than that of the animal EAEC isolates. The fis gene was highly expressed in majority of 'typical' EAEC isolates and the ecp gene in 'atypical' EAEC isolates."

CD011926,0,8897183,0,Epidemiological typing of isolates from an outbreak of infection with multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae by repetitive extragenic palindromic unit b1-primed PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.,"An outbreak of multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae infection lasted for 4 months in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Forty-six isolates from the NICU and 20 epidemiologically unrelated strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and repetitive extragenic palindromic unit b1-primed PCR (REPUb1-PCR) typing. The PFGE patterns after XbaI restriction of the bacterial DNA were analyzed by computer software (Gelcompar) using the UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages) clustering method and the Dice coefficient. The 46 isolates from the NICU were classified by PFGE typing into five clusters: A (further classified into 7 subtypes, A1 to A7), B, C, D, and E. This outbreak was attributed to multiple genetically related strains of cluster A which had a similarity of 85.8% +/- 4.6%. The minor band differences among strains of cluster A were probably due to minor genetic mutations. The type A1 and A3 strains were isolated from the clinical specimens of patients and hands of nurses. It was probable that these outbreak strains were transmitted among patients via the hands of personnel. REPUb1-PCR typing of the 46 isolates also demonstrated five types, in agreement with results obtained by the PFGE technique, but could not detect the minor mutations among the cluster A strains. Twenty epidemiologically unrelated strains were well distinguished by both PFGE and REPUb1-PCR typing. We conclude that PFGE is a highly discriminatory but time-consuming method for epidemiological typing of E. cloacae and that REPUb1-PCR is a more rapid method with good reproducibility and discriminatory power comparable to that of PFGE."
CD011926,0,18524966,0,Sensitive detection of multiple rotavirus genotypes with a single reverse transcription-real-time quantitative PCR assay.,"Rotaviruses are one of the major causes of diarrhea in infants and children under 5 years old, especially affecting developing countries. In natural disasters, fecal matter and potable waters can mix, allowing low, yet infective, concentrations of rotavirus to be present in water supplies, constituting a risk for the population. Any of the most commonly detected rotavirus genotypes could originate an outbreak. The development of a fast and sensitive method that could detect the broadest possible range of rotavirus genotypes would help with efficient diagnosis and prevention. We have designed a reverse transcription (RT)-real-time quantitative PCR approach targeted to the rotaviral VP2 gene, based on a multiple-sequence alignment of different human rotaviral strains. To overcome the high nucleotide sequence diversity, multiple forward and reverse primers were used, in addition to a degenerate probe. The performance of the assay was tested on isolates representing the most prevalent human genotypes: G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and G12P[8]. The developed method improved classical rotavirus detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nested RT-PCR by 5 and at least 1 order of magnitude, respectively. A survey of 159 stool samples indicated that the method can efficiently detect a broad range of rotavirus strains, including different G-P genotype combinations of human, porcine, and bovine origin. No cross-reactivity was observed with other enteric viruses, such as astrovirus, sapovirus, and norovirus."
CD011926,0,16628574,0,"Correlates of placental infection with cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19 or human herpes virus 7.","Vertical transmission of viruses is an important cause of morbidity in the fetus and neonate. Placental viral infection indicates risk of vertical transmission, but not always transmission to, or disease of the fetus. Specimens from mothers and babies from three groups-two prospective and one retrospective cohort-were tested for pathogens of teratogenic potential using multiplex PCR. Placental infection was present in 13% of the 105 samples collected. Assessment of the prospective cohorts showed cytomegalovirus (CMV) detected in 4% of placentae from unselected women, parvovirus B19 in 1% and Ureaplasma parvum in 1% of placentae. In a retrospective cohort of women at high risk of transmitting congenital infection due to seroconversion during pregnancy, miscarriage or stillbirth, CMV was detected in 64% and human herpes virus type 7 in 9% of placentae. Of 14 PCR-positive placentae, two were associated with the birth of a living symptomatic infant, two with stillbirth, one with miscarriage, and two with elective terminations of pregnancy. Directed laboratory assessment of women at high risk of transmitting congenital infection, on the basis of clinical or laboratory markers, is important for accurate diagnosis of adverse outcomes of pregnancy. However, routine screening for viruses in the placentae from women with a low-risk serological profile for transmitting congenital infection is unlikely to result in significant numbers of additional diagnoses and is confounded by inadequacy of current diagnostic methods. The major pathogen detected in all cases of placental infection associated with fetal death was human CMV."

CD011926,0,14519244,0,Aseptic meningitis epidemic during a West Nile virus avian epizootic.,"While enteroviruses have been the most commonly identified cause of aseptic meningitis in the United States, the role of the emerging, neurotropic West Nile virus (WNV) is not clear. In summer 2001, an aseptic meningitis epidemic occurring in an area of a WNV epizootic in Baltimore, Maryland, was investigated to determine the relative contributions of WNV and enteroviruses. A total of 113 aseptic meningitis cases with onsets from June 1 to September 30, 2001, were identified at six hospitals. WNV immunoglobulin M tests were negative for 69 patients with available specimens; however, 43 (61%) of 70 patients tested enterovirus-positive by viral culture or polymerase chain reaction. Most (76%) of the serotyped enteroviruses were echoviruses 13 and 18. Enteroviruses, including previously rarely detected echoviruses, likely caused most aseptic meningitis cases in this epidemic. No WNV meningitis cases were identified. Even in areas of WNV epizootics, enteroviruses continue to be important causative agents of aseptic meningitis."

CD011926,0,23432488,0,HIV drug resistance in mothers and infants following use of antiretrovirals to prevent mother-to-child transmission.,"The purpose of this article is to review prominent studies on HIV drug-resistance in mothers and their infants after the use of antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother-to-child-transmission in resource-limited communities. The effects of drug-resistance on subsequent combination antiretroviral therapy are discussed, as are the probable mechanisms of acquisition and decay or persistence of drug-resistant mutants. Differences in the rates of HIV drug-resistance from interventions used to prevent mother-to-child-transmission in North America and Europe are contrasted to the simplified regimens used in resource-limited settings. Unresolved issues related to HIV drug-resistance are reviewed, including: whether maternal zidovudine monotherapy selects significant resistance; the clinical relevance of HIV drug-resistant variants selected by single-dose nevirapine that persist as minority viral variants and can affect the outcome of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based therapy; and the use of maternal combination antiretroviral therapy during breastfeeding. Finally, the current and upcoming strategies to reduce HIV drug-resistance related to use of antiretrovirals to prevent mother-to-child-transmission are discussed and contrasted with the challenges of financing and administering antiretrovirals to prevent mother-to-child-transmission in resource-limited communities."
CD011926,0,17898783,0,Association of polymorphisms in the mannose-binding lectin gene and pulmonary morbidity in preterm infants.,"Deficiency in the collectin mannose-binding lectin (MBL) increases the risk for pulmonary and systemic infections and its complications in children and adults. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to determine the genetic association of sequence variations within the MBL gene with systemic infections and pulmonary short- and long-term complications in preterm infants below 32 weeks gestational age (GA). Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region and one SNP in the promotor region of MBL2 were genotyped by direct sequencing and with sequence-specific probes in 284 newborn infants <32 weeks GA. Clinical variables were comprehensively monitored. An association was found between two SNPs and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), defined as persistent oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, adjusting for covariates GA, grade of respiratory distress syndrome and days on mechanical ventilation (rs1800450 (exon 1 at codon 54, B variant): odds ratio dominant model (OR)=3.59, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.62-7.98; rs7096206 (-221, X variant): OR=2.40, 95% CI=1.16-4.96). Haplotype analyses confirmed the association to BPD, and a single haplotype (frequency 56%) including all SNPs in their wild-type form showed a negative association with the development of BPD. We detected no association between the MBL gene variations and the development of early-onset infections or further pulmonary complications. Frequent variants of the MBL gene, leading to low MBL concentrations, are associated with the diagnosis of BPD in preterm infants. This provides a basis for potential therapeutic options and further genetic and proteomic analysis of the function of MBL in the resistance against pulmonary long-term complications in preterm infants."
CD011926,0,22683462,0,Chromosomal microarray analysis of functional Xq27-qter disomy and deletion 3p26.3 in a boy with Prader-Willi like features and hypotonia.,"Duplications of the long arm of the X chromosome are rare. The infantile phenotype shares some resemblance with the Prader-Willi syndrome, presenting severe psychomotor retardation, facial dysmorphic features with a broad face, a small mouth and a thin pointed nose, hypotonia, urogenital malformation and proneness to infections. We report a boy with an additional Xq27-qter chromosome segment translocated onto the short arm of chromosome 3. The karyotype was 46,XY,der(3)t(X;3)(q27.3; p26.3)mat. This cryptic unbalanced X-autosome translocation resulted in Xq27-qter functional disomy and a deletion 3p26.3. A detailed analysis of the constitutional chromosomal changes in the patient was performed using array-CGH, FISH and PCR. The aim was to characterize the size and the location of the duplication Xq27-qter (8.18 Mb) and of the deletion 3p26.3 (1.05 Mb), to establish phenotype-genotype correlations and to offer genetic counselling."
CD011926,0,16645211,0,Diagnosis of human congenital cytomegalovirus infection by amplification of viral DNA from dried blood spots on perinatal cards.,"Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection affects 1% of children and is the most common infectious cause of sensorineural hearing loss. Due to the difficulty of diagnosing deafness and other neurological disorders in infants, affected individuals may not be recognized until much later when active infection has resolved and culture is no longer informative. To overcome this problem, congenital HCMV infection was diagnosed retrospectively by testing residual blood samples collected from newborns and dried on perinatal cards as part of the North Carolina Newborn Screening Program. We modified the Qiagen method for purifying DNA from dried blood spots to increase the sample size and recovery of the lysate. A multiplex, real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction assay on an ABI 7900 instrument measured a highly conserved segment of the HCMV polymerase gene and the APOB human control gene. HCMV DNA was detected in blood dried on perinatal cards from all seven infants with culture-proven congenital infection, and all 24 negative control cases lacked detectable HCMV DNA. Our findings suggest that it is possible to diagnose congenital HCMV infection using dried blood collected up to 20 months earlier. Further studies are warranted on patients with hearing loss or other neurological deficits to determine the percentage that is attributable to congenital HCMV infection."
CD011926,0,10447427,0,Epidemiological study of the G serotype distribution of group A rotaviruses in Kenya from 1991 to 1994.,"An epidemiological study on the G serotype distribution of group A rotaviruses (GARV) isolated in Kenya was carried out in one urban hospital in Nairobi and in two rural hospitals in Nanyuki and Kitui to clarify the prevalent G serotypes before future introduction of the ready licensed rotavirus vaccine in Kenya. A total of 1,431 stool specimens were collected from children, who were mainly outpatients, aged from 0 to 6 years old with acute gastroenteritis from August 1991 to July 1994. Samples positive for GARV by conventional ELISA were then analyzed by subgrouping and serotyping ELISA and by PAGE. To ascertain the G serotypes of viruses in samples that were unable to be typed by serotyping ELISA, polymerase chain reaction was also attempted. The prevalence of GARV was 28.4% in the urban hospital, 22.5% in Nanyuki, and 13.7% in Kitui. Among rotavirus-positive samples, subgroup II rotaviruses were detected in 63.1%, and subgroup I rotaviruses were 25.9%. Serotype G4 was most prevalent, accounting for 41.6% followed by 23.3% of serotype G1, 17.0% of serotype G2, and serotype G3 was rarely isolated. Seven strains of serotype G8/P1B rotavirus was detected for the first time in Kenya by RT-PCR. Eleven specimens with an unusual composition of subgroup, serotype, and electropherotype were atypical GARV in which the P-serotype was P1A, P1B, or P2. Although uncommon GARV serotype G8/P1B and atypical GARV were detected, the four major GARV serotypes, G1 through G4, should be targeted at this moment for vaccination to control this diarrheal disease in Kenya. Continuous monitoring of the G- and P-serotype distribution of GARV should provide important information about the impact of rotavirus vaccination in Kenya."
CD011926,0,25692622,0,A new vaccine escape mutant of hepatitis B virus causes occult infection.,"There is growing public concern regarding assay sensitivity to HBsAg mutants in clinical diagnosis and vaccine escape. The aim of this study is to introduce a new HBsAg mutant strain. The serum samples were those of patient X at the age of 3 months and 3 years respectively, and of her mother immediately before parturition, which were used to amplify the HBsAg-coding DNA fragments by PCR. The HBsAg DNA sequences were translated into their corresponding amino acid sequences and then aligned in pubmed with nucleotide blast. The sequencing data of S coding regions shows that patient X has been infected by a new HBV variant with an A to C substitution at nt431, resulting in an Asp(GAC)to Ala(GCC) substitution at aa144 of major protein; CC to AA substitution at nt359 and nt360, resulting in an Pro(CCC) to Gln(CAA) substitution at aa120 of pre ""a"" epitope; A to G substitution at nt491, resulting in an Glu(GAG) to Gly(GGG) substitution at aa164 of post ""a"" epitope.

CD011926,0,16427707,0,Sapovirus detection by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in clinical stool specimens.,"Sapovirus (SV) is one of the major causative agents of viral gastroenteritis affecting all age groups worldwide. A new method for the quantitative detection of SV from clinical stool specimens by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based on TaqMan MGB technology was described. Primers and probe were designed to target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase/capsid genes junction. Performance of the newly developed assay was validated against a panel of 244 clinical stool specimens collected for patients with gastroenteritis. SV was detected in eight (3.3%) specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the positive isolates suggested that the assay could detect at least SV genogroups I, II and IV. In addition, the assay had an increased detection rate compared with a widely used conventional RT-PCR assay. Quantitative analysis showed that the assay could detect as low as 10 copies of viral cDNA per reaction. No cross-reactivity with norovirus and rotavirus was observed. In conclusion, the assay is a sensitive and specific method for the detection of SV from clinical stool specimens."

CD011926,0,18553012,0,Prognostic markers of symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection.,"The objective of this research was to identify maternal and fetal characteristics as prognostic markers of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This is a descriptive study of 13 cases of congenital CMV infection referred to Institute de Puericulture et Perinatologie de Paris (IPP) from January 2005 to October 2006. Amniotic fluid puncture was performed to research CMV polimerase chain reaction (PCR). Cordocentesis and cord blood samples at delivery were also analyzed to determinate fetal platelets count, GGT, ASAT, ALAT, CMV-DNA and IgM antibody. Variables of symptomatic and asymptomatic infants were then compared. Data were analyzed by SPSS--15.0. Mean gestational age of amniocentesis was 24.6 weeks and there was no difference of mean viral load in amniotic fluid considering infant features. Mean gestational age of cordocentesis was 26.1 weeks. There were no statistical differences of fetal viral load, IgM, platelets, GGT, ASAT and ALAT analyzed at cordocentesis samples, but at delivery, mean values of IgM and ASAT of fetal blood were increased in symptomatic ones (p= 0.03 for both parameters). When considering groups with normal and abnormal parameters, ASAT of cordon samples was also increased in symptomatic infants (p= 0.02). Sensibility, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of fetal ultrasound anomalies to detect symptomatic infants were, respectively, 80%, 62.5%, 57.1% and 83.3%. Thus, identification of markers of CMV symptomatic infants should be aimed. Prenatal diagnosis, identification and follow up of congenital CMV infected infants are important to consider treatment for symptomatic infants, trying to avoid or reducing some possible sequels."
CD011926,0,24993909,0,Decreased lung function precedes severe respiratory syncytial virus infection and post-respiratory syncytial virus wheeze in term infants.,"It is unknown why respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes mild disease in some children and severe disease, requiring hospitalisation, in others. We aimed to assess whether diminished premorbid lung function in healthy term infants predisposes to hospitalisation during RSV bronchiolitis, and to post-RSV wheeze. In a prospective birth cohort study of unselected term healthy children, neonatal lung function was measured before the age of 2 months (n=2133). From birth through the first year of life, respiratory symptoms were recorded in a diary, and general practitioner consultations and hospitalisations were documented. In a subgroup (n=417) repeated nose and throat swabs were collected for PCR to detect RSV infections. Median neonatal respiratory system compliance (Crs) was significantly lower (41.2 versus 47.4 mL · kPa(-1), p=0.03) and resistance (Rrs) was higher (8.2 versus 6.3 kPa · s · L(-1), p=0.10) in hospitalised RSV patients (n=18) compared with nonhospitalised RSV-positive infants (n=84). Every 10 mL · kPa(-1) increase in Crs was associated with 55% less post-RSV wheeze (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90), and each kPa · s · L(-1) increase in Rrs was associated with 42% more post-RSV wheeze, which was only marginally explained by pre-RSV wheeze or severity of the RSV disease. This unselected birth cohort study shows for the first time that decreased lung function at birth predisposes to severe RSV disease, and to post-RSV wheeze."

Histopathologic examination of infected placental explants revealed cellular changes characteristic of HCMV infection. Immunohistochemical staining of infected explants with human convalescent sera demonstrated expression of HCMV antigens within the cytotrophoblast. Dot blot hybridization of DNA extracted from infected placental tissue using cloned Hind III ""W"" fragment of HCMV genome indicated the presence of HCMV sequences without virus-cell homology in infected explants from one to ten days post-infection. In general, the sequences detected by the viral probes increased in abundance with time as infection continued."

CD011926,0,24092030,0,"Clinical findings in 32 patients with 22qll.2 microdeletion attended in the city of Córdoba, Argentina.","The 22q11.2 microdeletion is the most common deletion syndrome, with a prevalence of 1/4000-1/6000 among newborn infants and a wide phenotypic variability. The diagnosis of the 22q11.2 microdeletion is made through cytogenetics or fuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The objectives of this article were to describe the clinical features of 32 patients with 22q11.2 microdeletion and the fndings of other chromosomal abnormalities and genetic syndromes in phenotypically similar patients. This series was made up of 268 patients with clinical criteria supporting the diagnostic suspicion attended at the Hospital de Niños and Hospital Privado, of Córdoba, between March 1st, 2004 and August 31st, 2011.

The cases of 21 patients (19 with candidemia, 2 with Candida meningitides) treated over a 1-year period in a Turkish hospital PICU and NICU were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-eight Candida isolates were detected from blood (20), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (2) and other specimens (6). Candida species were identified using the API ID 32C System. Susceptibility testing was done (all 28 isolates) for amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole using the broth microdilution method. Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) was used for molecular typing of the 3 most common ones; C. albicans (15), C. parapsilosis (6), and C. pelliculosa (4). Electrophoretic karyotyping (EK) was done to check clonal identity obtained by AP-PCR. Of the 20 blood isolates, 8 (40%) were C. albicans, 12 (60%) were non-albicans Candida, and one of the 2 CSF isolates was C. albicans. The overall species distribution was as follows: 15 C. albicans isolates, 6 C. parapsilosis isolates, 4 C. pelliculosa isolates, 2 C. famata isolates and 1 C tropicalis isolate. Amphotericin B had the best antifungal activity with a MIC90 of 0.125 microg/ml, and the rates of susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole were 93% and 82%, respectively. AP-PCR revealed 11 genotypes (4 were identical pairs, 7 were distinct) among the 15 C. albicans isolates, 2 genotypes (5 were classified in the same type) among the 6 C. parapsilosis isolates, and 4 separate genotypes for the 4 C. pelliculosa isolates. Karyotyping results correlated well with the AP-PCR findings. As indicated in the previous research, our results confirmed that non-albicans Candida species have become more frequently causative agents for invasive fungal infections in the ICU. Transmission of C. albicans and C. pelliculosa was relatively low, but transmission of C. parapsilosis was high, suggesting that more effective control and very strict treatment protocols are needed for patients having high mortality and invasive fungal infection in ICU."

Three hundred five urine samples were tested by PCR and conventional virus isolation in cell culture. Viruria was detected in 47 urine samples by PCR using a primer pair which amplifies part of the major immediate-early (MIE) CMV genome. The PCR compared to virus isolation showed 89.6% sensitivity, 98.5% specificity and 91.5% positive predictive value. PCR with primer pairs amplifying parts of the glycoprotein B and glycoprotein H genes of CMV were used for confirmation of the positivity of the 47 urine samples. We concluded that this CMV PCR assay in urine has a suitable sensitivity for the diagnosis of congenital and perinatal infections and its specificity is highly increased by use of more than one pair of primers among the ones we used."

CD011926,0,20721445,0,[Direct immunofluorescence assay performance in diagnosis of the Influenza A(H1N1) virus].,"By 25 April 2009, less than one month after the first human with Influenza A(H1N1) virus was detected in Mexico, the disease had already spread to more than 40 countries, with over 10,000 cases reported. Due to its unpredictability, this type of virus requires appropriate, reliable, and safe diagnostic methods that are also accessible to clinical laboratories. Through the analysis of 291 samples taken from patients with suspected Influenza A(H1N1) virus infection in Neuquén, Argentina, this study compares the two diagnostic methods used simultaneously: direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). DFA had a sensitivity of 44.4%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 95.2%, and a negative predictive value of 90.7%. Positive results obtained with this method can be considered true positives. A negative result does not rule out the presence of the virus. In this case, the sample should be examined by RT-PCR. Out of a total of 291 samples, there were 45 positive results with RT-PCR and 21 positive results with DFA."
CD011926,0,16019259,0,Improved RT-PCR for diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of rubella.,"A reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed and evaluated for detection of rubella virus (RV) RNA directly from clinical specimens using primers that amplified 592 nucleotides, of a variable region within the E1 gene. RV RNA was detected in pre- and post-natal congenital rubella samples and samples from patients with acute rubella, which suggests that it is a reliable technique for rubella diagnosis and surveillance. The sensitivity of the PCR was found to be equivalent to that of previously published assays, which amplify smaller regions of the E1 gene. This improved RT-PCR is much more specific for detection of the rubella genome compared to our previous PCR, where some primers were complementary to the human genome. The larger size of the PCR amplicon was also useful for molecular genotyping of virus strains."

The molecular approach gave better results for BM diagnosis: sensitivity (S) was 90.6% compared to 78.1% for the bacterial culture. Percentages of cases correctly diagnosed (CCD) were 91.7% and 80.6%, respectively. For EONS diagnosis, S was 60.0% for the molecular approach and 70.0% for the bacterial culture; and CCD was 95.2% and 96.4%, respectively. For SPB diagnosis, the molecular approach gave notably poorer results than the bacterial cultures.

A total of 215 patients of all ages with meningitis signs were investigated in 2 Tunisian hospitals. Their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analysed retrospectively for EVs with a TaqMan real-time RT-qPCR. The virus strains were typed, and their evolutionary relationships were determined by Bayesian phylogenetic methods. An EV genome was detected in 21/215 patients (9.8%). The CSF viral loads ranged from 3.27 to 5.63 log10 genome copies/mL. The strains were identified in 13/21 patients and assigned to EV-B types. Viruses identified in Tunisian patients were genetically related to variants detected in France. The viral loads were similar in Tunisian and French patients for most EV types. The phylogenetic data and viral loads determined in Tunisian and French patients suggest that close EV variants were involved in aseptic meningitis in the 2 countries over a same period."
CD011926,0,20093380,0,A novel IS26 structure surrounds blaCTX-M genes in different plasmids from German clinical Escherichia coli isolates.,"This report focuses on the molecular characterization of 22 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolates collected in a German university hospital during a period of 9 months in 2006. Relationship analysis of clinical isolates was done via PFGE, multilocus sequence typing, plasmid profiling and additionally PCR for bla(ESBL) detection and determination of phylogroups. After conjugal transfer, plasmid isolation and subsequent PCR for bla(ESBL) detection and determination of incompatibility groups were performed. Using one-primer walking, up to 3600 bp upstream and downstream of different bla(CTX-M) genes could be sequenced. beta-Lactamases found were TEM-1 (n=14), SHV-5 (n=1) and a wide variety of CTX-M types (n=21), i.e. CTX-M-15 (n=12), CTX-M-1 (n=4), CTX-M-14 (n=2), CTX-M-9 (n=1), CTX-M-3 (n=1) and one new type, CTX-M-65 (n=1). In 18 isolates, bla(ESBL) genes were located on conjugative plasmids of sizes between 40 and 180 kbp belonging to incompatibility groups FII (n=9), N (n=5) and I1 (n=4). bla(CTX-M) was found to be associated with the common elements ISEcp1, IS26 and IS903-D, but with unusual spacer sequences for ISEcp1 in two isolates. These insertion sequences, connected to bla(CTX-M) as well as other genes, were located between two IS26 elements in a configuration that has not yet been described. The results reveal the emergence of bla(ESBL), predominantly bla(CTX-M), located on different plasmids harboured by genotypically different E. coli strains. The identical gene arrangement in the bla(CTX-M) neighbourhood in plasmids of different incompatibility groups indicates a main role of IS26 in distribution of mobile resistance elements between different plasmids."
CD011926,0,10606090,0,Genetic analysis reveals ongoing HIV type 1 evolution in infected human placental trophoblast.,"To provide a better understanding of the role of placenta in vertical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, we have studied the infection of placental trophoblast in a group of 15 mother-neonate pairs. By nested PCR amplification of the C2V3 env gene region, HIV-1 has been found to infect the placenta in five cases (33%). Phylogenetic analysis of the cloned sequences showed that all recovered maternal variants were of the B subtype. Further investigation into the ancestral relationships at the nucleotide level revealed that the trophoblast sequences evolved into a quasispecies population clearly distant from that observed in the mother. As expected, the populations transmitted to the trophoblast were also found to be more homogeneous than those in the mothers when characterized on the basis of pairwise nucleotide sequence distances. With regard to the predicted biological properties, the primary amino acid structure of the V3 loop domain was consistent, with a macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing phenotype in all patients. We also attempted to determine if any of a number of selected maternal or viral factors was associated with trophoblast infection. However, none of the followed parameters, including maternal age, disease stage, antiretroviral therapy, CCR5delta32 deletion status of the infant, and viral genotype, could be associated with viral transmission. Moreover, in one pair with proven trophoblast infection, HIV was also detected in the cord blood. Taken together, our data suggest that the productive trophoblast infection by HIV-1 in vivo is a relatively frequent event that may bear direct implications for a further transplacental propagation of the virus."

The development, optimization, and clinical validation of a LAMP assay targeting the ctrA gene for the rapid detection of capsular Neisseria meningitidis were described. Highly specific detection of capsular N. meningitidis type strains and clinical isolates was demonstrated, with no cross-reactivity with other Neisseria spp. or with a comprehensive panel of other common human pathogens. The lower limit of detection was 6 ctrA gene copies detectable in 48 min, with positive reactions readily identifiable visually via a simple color change. Higher copy numbers could be detected in as little as 16 min. When applied to a total of 394 clinical specimens, the LAMP assay in comparison to a conventional TaqMan® based real-time polymerase chain reaction system demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98.9% with a κ coefficient of 0.942. The LAMP method represents a rapid, sensitive, and highly specific technique for the detection of N. meningitidis and has the potential to be used as a point-of-care molecular test and in resource-poor settings."

Here, we describe patients with STEC infection and characterize the STEC strains detected in our laboratory by use of PCR for stx1, stx2, and eae from 1996 through 2011. Patient information was collected from referral forms and from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases. STEC isolates were characterized with respect to serogroup or serotype, selected potential virulence genes, and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) genotype. STEC strains were isolated from 138 (1.09%) of 12,651 patients tested. STEC strains of serogroups O26, O103, O121, O145, and O157 were the most frequent. These serogroups, except non-sorbitol-fermenting O157, were also the most frequent among the 11 patients (all ≤5 years old) who developed HUS. Twenty-four STEC strains were classified as being HUS associated based on an epidemiological link to a HUS case, including an MLVA genotype identical to that of the STEC strain. The age of the patient (≤5 years) and the genes eae and stx2a were significantly associated with HUS-associated STEC (P < 0.05 for each parameter), while stx1 was associated with non-HUS-associated STEC (P < 0.05). All of the potential virulence genes analyzed, except ehxA, were significantly more frequent among HUS-associated than non-HUS-associated strains (P < 0.05 for each gene). However, these genes were also present in some non-HUS-associated STEC strains and could therefore not reliably differentiate between HUS-associated and non-HUS-associated STEC strains."

Trans-neuronal transmission by HSV type 1 causes herpes simplex encephalitis both in children and adults, while hematogeneous spread by HSV type 1 or type 2 causes CNS infections in neonates. Mortality of CNS infections by HSV in childhood has been improved since early diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction and anti-viral therapies have been established.

CD011926,0,11136786,0,Outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis associated with Enterobacter sakazakii in powdered milk formula.,"We describe an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) that occurred in the neonatal intensive care unit of our hospital. A total of 12 neonates developed NEC in June-July 1998. For two of them, twin brothers, the NEC turned out to be fatal. Enterobacter sakazakii, a known contaminant of powdered milk formula, was isolated from a stomach aspirate, anal swab, and/or blood sample for 6 of the 12 neonates. A review of feeding procedures revealed that 10 of the 12 patients were fed orally with the same brand of powdered milk formula. E. sakazakii was isolated from the implicated prepared formula milk as well as from several unopened cans of a single batch. Molecular typing by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) confirmed, although partially, strain similarity between milk and patient isolates. No further cases of NEC were observed after the use of the contaminated milk formula was stopped. With this outbreak we show that intrinsic microbiological contamination of powdered milk formula can be a possible contributive factor in the development of NEC, a condition encountered almost exclusively in formula-fed premature infants. The use of sterilized liquid milk formula in neonatal care could prevent problems with intrinsic and extrinsic contamination of powdered milk formula."

CD011926,0,25355758,0,DNA microarray for detection of gastrointestinal viruses.,"Gastroenteritis is a clinical illness of humans and other animals that is characterized by vomiting and diarrhea and caused by a variety of pathogens, including viruses. An increasing number of viral species have been associated with gastroenteritis or have been found in stool samples as new molecular tools have been developed. In this work, a DNA microarray capable in theory of parallel detection of more than 100 viral species was developed and tested. Initial validation was done with 10 different virus species, and an additional 5 species were validated using clinical samples. Detection limits of 1 × 10(3) virus particles of Human adenovirus C (HAdV), Human astrovirus (HAstV), and group A Rotavirus (RV-A) were established. Furthermore, when exogenous RNA was added, the limit for RV-A detection decreased by one log. In a small group of clinical samples from children with gastroenteritis (n = 76), the microarray detected at least one viral species in 92% of the samples. Single infection was identified in 63 samples (83%), and coinfection with more than one virus was identified in 7 samples (9%). The most abundant virus species were RV-A (58%), followed by Anellovirus (15.8%), HAstV (6.6%), HAdV (5.3%), Norwalk virus (6.6%), Human enterovirus (HEV) (9.2%), Human parechovirus (1.3%), Sapporo virus (1.3%), and Human bocavirus (1.3%). To further test the specificity and sensitivity of the microarray, the results were verified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) detection of 5 gastrointestinal viruses. The RT-PCR assay detected a virus in 59 samples (78%). The microarray showed good performance for detection of RV-A, HAstV, and calicivirus, while the sensitivity for HAdV and HEV was low. Furthermore, some discrepancies in detection of mixed infections were observed and were addressed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of the viruses involved. It was observed that differences in the amount of genetic material favored the detection of the most abundant virus. The microarray described in this work should help in understanding the etiology of gastroenteritis in humans and animals."

From patients in a level 3 Bogota hospital, Klebsiella pneumoniae samples were isolated that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Each of 15 isolates was characterized microbiologically and by molecular characters realized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and by repetitive-DNA sequences amplification (REP-PCR). Antimicrobial susceptibility and ESBL production was determined in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. The beta-lactamases were evaluated by isoelectric-focusing and PCR. Twelve (80%) of the isolates were associated with nosocomial infection; 11 of them were from intensive care units. The antibiotic susceptibility displayed 13 resistance patterns--87% presented co-resistance to amikacin, 53% to gentamicin, 33% to ciprofloxacin, 40% to cefepime, 67% to piperacillin/tazobactam, 60% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and 47% to chloranphenicol. All were sensitive to imipenem. Production of TEM and SHV beta-lactamases was detected simultaneously in most isolates by isoelectric focusing and 93.3% produced a ceftazidimase of pl 8.2 of the SHV-5 type. The 15 isolates were grouped into 11 and 12 electrophoretic patterns by PFGE and REP-PCR, respectively. The degree of genetic variability indicated an endogenous origin of the nosocomial infections."

In this study we describe the characteristics of S. epidermidis strains causing late onset (>72 h) bloodstream infection in preterm infants and skin isolates from healthy newborns. Attachment and biofilm formation capability were analyzed in microtiter plates and with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Clonal relationship among strains was studied with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed, as well as the detection of biofilm-associated genes and of the invasiveness marker IS256 with polymerase chain reaction. Blood and skin isolates had similar attachment and biofilm-forming capabilities and biofilm formation was not related to the presence of specific genes. Filament-like membrane structures were seen by TEM early in the attachment close to the device surface, both in blood and skin strains. Nine of the ten blood isolates contained the IS256 and were also resistant to methicillin and gentamicin in contrast to skin strains. S. epidermidis strains causing bloodstream infection in preterm infants exhibit higher antibiotic resistance and are provided with an invasive genetic equipment compared to skin commensal strains. Adhesion capability to a device surface seems to involve bacterial membrane filaments."

Recently, a hypothesis was proposed that H. pylori infection could be a frequent cause for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We have investigated this postulated association by examining formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gastric tissues of a retrospective cohort of 94 SIDS cases: The presence of H. pylori was inferred from a newly developed real-time quantitative PCR assay with SYBR Green I detection. This assay is based on the amplification of the single-copy H. pylori-specific glmM gene. Accuracy and precision were verified using a plasmid containing a 977-bp fragment of this glmM gene. The assay was very sensitive, and as few as 30 template copies per PCR reaction could be detected even in the presence of excess human DNA. The assay was validated on mucosal biopsy samples of patients with known H. pylori infections. Interfering effects due to SIDS gastric tissue were excluded. Only two (2.1%) of the SIDS samples yielded H. pylori DNA copy numbers and only beyond the lowest standard concentration. These results could be confirmed independently by immunohistochemistry using an H. pylori-specific antibody. Thus, an infection by H. pylori is very rare in cases of SIDS, and thus the postulated association of H. pylori infection and SIDS cannot be confirmed."

In total, 74 A. baumannii were screened for MBL production by the imipenem-EDTA method and were characterised for antibiotic sensitivity. PCR was performed to detect the presence of blaNDM and the co-existence of ESBL and AmpC genes. NDM-producing isolates were typed by ERIC-PCR, and the association of integrons with blaNDM-1 and the presence of gene cassettes were determined using specific primers. The genetic location of blaNDM in ISAba125 was also determined. Transformation was performed using a heat-shock method. Three isolates were found to harbour blaNDM, all of which co-produced blaEBC, blaDHA and blaCIT AmpC β-lactamases. All MBL-producers showed resistance to cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and tigecycline but were susceptible to polymyxin B. Presence of class 1 integrons was demonstrated in all three blaNDM-harbouring isolates, whilst linkage between the integron and blaNDM could not be established. Detection of gene cassettes revealed the presence of dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase [aac(6')] genes. Presence of blaNDM in ISAba125 was also observed. These findings suggest that ISAba125 appears to be the main genetic component for dissemination of blaNDM in A. baumannii. The association of blaNDM-1 with ISAba125 and the mobility of other multiresistance region (gene cassette)-carrying integrons provide an easy way to cross species barriers and reach a level that places the patients at risk."

We developed a ddPCR assay for Chlamydia trachomatis infections and found it to be accurate and precise. Using PCR mixtures containing plasmids engineered to include the PCR target sequences, we were able to quantify with a dynamic range between 0.07 and 3,160 targets/μl (r(2) = 0.9927) with >95% confidence. Using 1,509 clinical conjunctival swab samples from a population in which trachoma is endemic in Guinea Bissau, we evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of the quantitative ddPCR assay in diagnosing ocular C. trachomatis infections by comparing the performances of ddPCR and the Roche Amplicor CT/NG test. We defined ddPCR tests as positive when we had ≥95% confidence in a nonzero estimate of target load. The sensitivity of ddPCR against Amplicor was 73.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.9 to 78.7%), and specificity was 99.1% (95% CI, 98.6 to 99.6%). Negative and positive predictive values were 94.6% (95% CI, 93.4 to 95.8%) and 94.5% (95% CI, 91.3 to 97.7%), respectively. Based on Amplicor CT/NG testing, the estimated population prevalence of C. trachomatis ocular infection was ∼17.5%. Receiver-operator curve analysis was used to select critical cutoff values for use in clinical settings in which a balance between higher sensitivity and specificity is required. We concluded that ddPCR is an effective diagnostic technology suitable for both research and clinical use in diagnosing ocular C. trachomatis infections."
CD011926,0,19319981,0,Perinatal transmission of hepatitis C virus infection.,"In industrialized countries, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children. Perinatal transmission is the leading cause of infection. Perinatal transmission is confined almost always to women with detectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the peripheral blood by the polymerase chain reaction but all children born to women with anti-HCV antibodies should be tested for HCV. Some but not all studies found that a high concentration of serum HCV RNA is associated with a higher risk of transmission. Maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cell infection by HCV, membrane rupture of longer than 6 hr before delivery, and procedures exposing the infant to maternal blood infected with HCV during vaginal delivery are associated with an increased risk of transmission. Maternal coinfection with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus, maternal history of intravenous drug use and of HCV infection of the sexual partner of the mother predict the risk of perinatal transmission and are dependent on the peripheral blood mononuclear cell infection by HCV. Delivery by Cesarean section is not recommended in pregnant women infected with HCV. Infected mothers can breast feed safely their infants if the nipples are not damaged. A previous delivery of a child infected perinatally with HCV does not increase the risk of transmission in subsequent pregnancies. Immunogenetic factors and HCV genotypes are not related to HCV perinatal transmission. Despite an increased understanding of the risk factors involved in perinatal transmission of HCV, to date little is known about the transmission mechanisms and timing."

The analytical sensitivity of the duplex PCR assays with internal controls incorporated is 7.0, 19.0, 5x10(3) and 7x10(2) genome copies per reaction for Ct, GC, Mh and Uu respectively. Specificity was demonstrated by the amplification of only target DNA in the presence of other organisms. Among 40 women with normal, at term, deliveries, there were 6 positives for Ct, 2 for GC and 1 for Uu. None of these women had signs of genital tract infection. The Mh/Uu PCR was positive in 11 of 40 PROM cases, with 7 women positive for Uu, 2 for Mh and 2 others for both organisms. Of 40 blood cultures taken from post-partum maternal infections, 6 were positive for Ct and 1 for Mh. Respiratory secretions from 30 premature neonates yielded 5 positives for Uu and one each for Mh and Ct. In contrast, there was only 1 positive result (for Mh) in 30 mature neonates. With 1 exception, all mycoplasma and ureaplasma positives were confirmed by culture and the concordance between paired tracheal aspirates and nasopharyngeal swabs from neonates was 96.7%. These results show the potential use of the duplex PCR assays for the diagnosis of maternal and neonatal disease caused by the four urogenital pathogens."

In Japan, CA-MRSA infections and CA-MRSA surveillance have been scarcely reported. In this study, we conducted a nationwide survey of CA-MRSA in Japan. We collected MRSA strains isolated from outpatients with skin and soft-tissue infection (SSTI) at 107 medical facilities from 24 prefectures in 2010 and 2012. Among 10,385 clinical samples from SSTI patients, 3,581 S. aureus isolates (35%) were obtained and 673 of the S. aureus strains (19%) were identified as MRSA. Among 625 MRSA strains tested in this study, 266 strains (43%) and 114 strains (18%) were classified as SCCmec types IV and V, respectively. Detection of virulence genes was as follows: Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene (57 strains, 9%), exfoliative toxin (ET) gene (179 strains, 29%), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) gene (195 strains, 31%), or none. PVL-positive strains were classified into eight sequence types (STs) (i.e., ST1, ST5, ST8, ST22, ST30, ST452, ST59, and ST154) and six clonal complexes (i.e., CC1, CC5, CC8, CC22, CC30, and CC59). Only 10 PVL-positive strains (2%) were pulsed-field type USA300 clone. There were a wide variety of CA-MRSA clones in Japan, which were different from the situation in the United States."

CD011926,0,11929775,0,Effects of exogenous interleukin-7 on human thymus function.,"Immune reconstitution is a critical component of recovery after treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cancer chemotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The ability to enhance T-cell production would benefit such treatment. We examined the effects of exogenous interleukin-7 (IL-7) on apoptosis, proliferation, and the generation of T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs) in human thymus. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the highest level of TRECs (14 692 copies/10 000 cells) was present in the CD1a(+)CD3(-)CD4(+)CD8(+) stage in native thymus, suggesting that TREC generation occurred following the cellular division in this subpopulation. In a thymic organ culture system, exogenous IL-7 increased the TREC frequency in fetal as well as infant thymus, indicating increased T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement. Although this increase could be due to the effect of IL-7 to increase thymocyte proliferation and decrease apoptosis of immature CD3(-) cells, the in vivo experiments using NOD/LtSz-scid mice given transplants of human fetal thymus and liver suggested that IL-7 can also directly enhance TREC generation. Our results provide compelling evidence that IL-7 has a direct effect on increasing TCR-alphabeta rearrangement and indicate the potential use of IL-7 for enhancing de novo naïve T-cell generation in immunocompromised patients."

This was a prospective study conducted from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999 in an antenatal clinic setting of a teaching hospital. The study group included women who were CMV IgG negative and aged <30 years or had a pre-school child. They were invited to self-collect urine samples monthly and send them to the laboratory by post. Cord bloods were tested for CMV IgG to detect seroconversion. An anxiety questionnaire was sent to all study participants. At first attendance, 1549 (42%) women were CMV IgG negative. Of the 696 eligible women, 609 (88%) participated in the urine PCR study. PCR was performed on 2263 urine samples (median of 4/pregnancy). Primary CMV infection was identified in one woman by urine PCR at 36 weeks (baby CMV negative). Cord blood samples were available from 152/609 infants (25%). Seroconversion was noted in only one woman. Replies to the questionnaire were received from 264/609 women (43%): 214 (81%) had little or no anxiety, and 220 (83%) felt reassured by their study participation. Serial urine PCR is a feasible method of detecting primary maternal CMV infection during pregnancy which has potential for evaluation in further studies."

CDC Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study Group.,"The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced thymic dysfunction (TD) on mortality was studied in 265 infected infants in the CDC Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study. TD was defined as both CD4 and CD8 T cell counts below the 5th percentile of joint distribution for uninfected infants within 6 months of life. The 40 HIV-infected infants with TD (15%) had a significantly greater mortality than did the 225 children without TD (44% vs. 9% within 2 years). Infants with TD infected in utero had higher mortality than did those infected intrapartum (70% vs. 37% within 2 years), while no significant difference was noted between infants without TD with either mode of transmission. The TD profile was independent of plasma virus load. Virus-induced TD by particular HIV strains and the time of transmission are likely to explain the variation in pathogenesis and patterns of disease progression and suggest the need for early aggressive therapies for HIV-infected infants with TD."
CD011926,0,25100822,0,Exploring the potential of next-generation sequencing in detection of respiratory viruses.,"Efficient detection of human respiratory viral pathogens is crucial in the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infection. Sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acids combined with next-generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses is a promising strategy for identifying pathogens in clinical and public health settings. It allows the characterization of hundreds of different known pathogens simultaneously and of novel pathogens that elude conventional testing. However, major hurdles for its routine use exist, including cost, turnaround time, and especially sensitivity of the assay, as the detection limit is dependent on viral load, host genetic material, and sequencing depth. To obtain insights into these aspects, we analyzed nasopharyngeal aspirates from a cohort of 81 Thai children with respiratory disease for the presence of respiratory viruses using a sequence-independent next-generation sequencing approach and routinely used diagnostic real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (real-time RT-PCR) assays. With respect to the detection of rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus, the next-generation sequencing approach was at least as sensitive as diagnostic real-time RT-PCR in this small cohort, whereas for bocavirus and enterovirus, next-generation sequencing was less sensitive than real-time RT-PCR. The advantage of the sequencing approach over real-time RT-PCR was the immediate availability of virus-typing information. Considering the development of platforms capable of generating more output data at declining costs, next-generation sequencing remains of interest for future virus diagnosis in clinical and public health settings and certainly as an additional tool when screening results from real-time RT-PCR are negative."

PCR amplification of highly conserved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gag gene sequences was performed with SK38 and SK39 primers, the latter of which was 5' biotinylated. Post-PCR reaction mixtures were combined with 10(12) copies of the SK19 probe-Tris-bipyridine ruthenium(II) conjugate, denatured by heating at 100 degrees C for 5 min, and hybridized at 55 degrees C for an additional 15 min. Hybridization to the biotinylated strand of the amplified DNA was determined by the addition of streptavidin-conjugated magnetic particles and analyzed by using an Origen-1 electrochemiluminescence analyzer. Our results demonstrated a sensitivity of fewer than five copies of HIV-1 (pre-PCR), by using either purified plasmid DNA containing one complete copy of the HIV-1 cDNA genome or lysed, proteinase K-treated 8E5 cells as the starting material. In an evaluation of actual clinical specimens (peripheral blood monocytes from both healthy and HIV-1-infected children), the electrochemiluminescent detection assay correlated 100% with both our standard method (solution hybridization with a radiolabeled probe followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [PAGE] and autoradiography) and a commercial method (Roche Amplicor). The electrochemiluminescent method was substantially easier to perform than either the PAGE or microtiter plate assays and was considerable faster to perform than either of these alternative formats."
CD011926,0,17516517,0,Effective program against mother-to-child transmission of HIV at Saint Camille Medical Centre in Burkina Faso.,"The present research was aimed to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV; to use RT-PCR in order to detect, 6 months after birth, infected children; and to test the antiretroviral resistance of both children and mothers in order to offer them a suitable therapy. At the Saint Camille Medical Centre, 3,127 pregnant women (aged 15-44 years) accepted to be enrolled in the mother-to-child transmission prevention protocol that envisages: (i) Voluntary Counselling and Testing for all the pregnant women; (ii) Antiretroviral therapy for HIV positive pregnant women and for their newborns; (iii) either powdered milk feeding or short breast-feeding and RT-PCR test for their children; (iv) finally, pol gene sequencing and antiretroviral resistance identifications among HIV positive mothers and children. Among the patients, 227/3,127 HIV seropositive women were found: 221/227 HIV-1, 4/227 HIV-2, and 2/227 mixed HIV infections. The RT-PCR test allowed the detection of 3/213 (1.4%) HIV infected children: 0/109 (0%) from mothers under ARV therapy and 3/104 (2.8%) from mothers treated with Nevirapine. All children had recombinant HIV-1 strain (CRF06_CPX) with: minor PR mutations (M36I, K20I) and RT mutations (R211K). Among them, two twins had Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor mutation (Y18CY). Both mothers acquired a major PR mutation (V8IV), investigated 6 months after a single-dose of Nevirapine. Prevention by single-dose of Nevirapine reduced significantly mother-to-child transmission of HIV, but caused many mutations and resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Based on present study the antiretroviral therapy protocol, together with the artificial-feeding, might represent the ideal strategy to avoid transmission of HIV from mother-to-child."

Substantial CMV loads were detected in peripheral blood cells, plasma, and urine when the patient was in crisis, but was decreased in parallel to clinical improvement without using ganciclovir. CMV DNA was not detected from his umbilical cord or Guthrie card, even by highly sensitive real-time PCR. Molecular profiles were indistinguishable between the CMV strain isolated from his urine and that from maternal breast milk, indicating postnatal acquisition of CMV through breast milk. Although he had transient hearing impairment, his neurodevelopmental outcome of 30 months of corrected age was normal. Further accumulation of clinical and virological data in postnatal CMV infection is necessary for evaluating the severity and selecting patients requiring antiviral therapy."

In total, 103 children (54 boys and 49 girls) between 0 and 14 years of age were involved in this study. Fifty-three were Roma children and 50 children represented a non-Roma control group. Fecal samples were examined: immunologically [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to prove antigen in the feces] and by molecular analysis [nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]. After the sequencing of the PCR, the products were identified as species of Cryptosporidium muris. Based on the results, the relative risk (RR) of the Cryptosporidium infection occurrence was calculated and we came to the conclusion that the risk of Cryptosporidium infection was almost 12 times higher in the Roma children compared to the non-Roma children."

CD011926,0,16943357,0,Pregnancy and human herpesvirus 8 reactivation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected women.,"To investigate the impact of pregnancy on human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) reactivation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected women, the HHV-8 DNA presence and load were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cervicovaginal secretions (CVSs) from 15 pregnant women coinfected with HIV-1 and HHV-8. HHV-8 detection was analyzed in relation to anti-HHV-8 antibodies and HIV-1-related parameters. Nucleotide sequence analysis of an ORFK1 hypervariable region of the HHV-8 strains was performed. HHV-8 was detected in maternal PBMCs (5/15 women) from the second trimester and in CVSs (5/15 women) mainly from the third trimester. The HHV-8 load significantly increased late in pregnancy in both maternal compartments and was associated with a significant increase in HIV-1 shedding in the genital tract. Antilytic antibodies were significantly more common in HHV-8 DNA-positive women. An elevated HHV-8 load was found in the PBMCs of an infant born to a mother with large amounts of HHV-8 in both compartments at delivery. Different ORFK1 subtypes were found in maternal samples, whereas the same subtype was identified in the mother-child pair. These data suggest that pregnancy may induce HHV-8 replication in HIV-1-infected women. An augmented HHV-8 load may, in turn, influence mother-to-child transmission, since one of the HIV-1-infected mothers with HHV-8 reactivation transmitted her ORFK1 subtype to the infant, who showed a high level of HHV-8 viremia indicative of a primary infection. This finding documents for the first time the perinatal transmission of a specific HHV-8 subtype. Vertical transmission may thus play a role in HHV-8 spread also in areas of subendemicity among HIV-1-infected women."

CD011926,0,12152521,0,Measurement of HIV-1 p24 antigen by signal-amplification-boosted ELISA of heat-denatured plasma is a simple and inexpensive alternative to tests for viral RNA.,"Assessment of HIV-1 RNA concentration is widely used for monitoring antiretroviral therapies. Tests are, however, expensive and require technically advanced equipment and highly trained personnel. Increasing availability of antiretroviral treatment in resource-poor settings calls for simple and inexpensive virus tests. HIV-1 p24 antigen tests were frequently used before the availability of nucleic acid tests (NAT). Two simple modifications, heat-mediated destruction of test-interfering antibodies and increased sensitivity achieved by signal amplification, have shaped the p24 antigen test into a tool that rivals NAT. This improved p24 antigen test, for which all reagents are available from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, was evaluated in clinical studies in comparison with the most sensitive PCR methods available at a given time. In a prospective study over 4 years, HIV-1 infection among 859 samples from 307 infants born to HIV-positive mothers in Switzerland was detected as sensitively by p24 antigen assay as by PCR for viral DNA or RNA: 100% sensitivity of all methods after 10 days of age; 99.2% diagnostic specificity of p24 after neutralization (RNA, 98.6%). A study conducted in Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) found 123 of 125 samples from 76 PCR-positive infants positive for p24 antigen (sensitivity = 98.7%). In 169 infected Swiss adults with a median CD4+ T-cell count of 140 cells/microliter followed for a median of 2.7 years, p24 at baseline correlated as well as or better than HIV-1 RNA with the ensuing CD4+ T-lymphocyte decline and was independently predictive of progression to clinical AIDS (P = 0.043) and survival (P = 0.032). RNA predicted AIDS (P < 0.005), but not survival (P = 0.19). Another study of first-visit samples from 496 mostly black IVDU in the U.S. with a median CD4+ count of 518 cells/microliter showed equally strong prediction of progression to clinical AIDS for p24 antigen, HIV-1 RNA, and CD4+ T-lymphocyte concentrations at baseline. Treatment-associated changes in p24 and RNA levels in adults and children correlated well in three Swiss studies. The half-life of p24 antigen in the first phase of effective treatment was 1.6 +/- 0.4 days (RNA, 1.7 +/- 0.8). A second, slower decay phase had a half-life of 42 +/- 16 days. One study suggested that a strategy involving a somewhat more frequent testing for p24 antigen permitted detection of viral failures significantly earlier than tests for HIV-1 RNA conducted at 3-month intervals, while at the same time significantly saving on costs. Experience from three studies indicates that the p24 antigen test recognizes viruses of subtypes A-G and O, as well as some recombinant isolates, but leaves open the possibility that some non-B p24 antigens may be suboptimally detected. This improved p24 antigen test provides diagnosis of pediatric HIV infection, prediction of prognosis and treatment monitoring in quality comparable to tests for HIV-1 RNA, but at much lower costs. There is no problem with sample instability and no need for cumbersome nucleic acid extraction. The test is validated for subtype B, but requires further studies for non-B subtypes."

CD011926,0,9820838,0,Improvement of the specificity of enzyme immunoassays for the detection of rotavirus and adenovirus in fecal specimens.,"A variable rate of false-positive results may be observed with commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for the detection of rotavirus and adenovirus antigen in stool specimens, depending on the quality of the reagents and the presence of potentially interfering substances in stool samples. The present study was performed in an attempt to improve the specificity of current commercial rotavirus and adenovirus EIAs without significant loss of sensitivity by optimizing the cut-off value. A collective of 174 stool samples obtained from children suffering from acute gastroenteritis was tested. Electron microscopy (EM) and PAGE were used as reference methods for rotavirus detection. For the evaluation of the adenovirus kits, virus isolation in cell culture and the polymerase chain reaction served as reference standards. The highest sensitivity for rotavirus and adenovirus detection was achieved by the Ridascreen(R) Rotavirus and Ridascreen Adenovirus. However, the Ridascreen(R) Rotavirus and Ridascreen Adenovirus produced the highest number of false-positive results (n = 9) for each rotavirus and adenovirus detection. Cross-reactivities to coronaviruses and reoviruses were observed with the rotavirus antigen EIAs. For Rotazyme II, Ridascreen Rotavirus and Ridascreen Adenovirus, the specificity could be markedly increased without loss of sensitivity by doubling the cut-off value. For the alternative immunoassays, which were overall more specific, it was not possible to significantly decrease the rate of false-positive results without impairment of sensitivity by raising the cut-off value. In conclusion, at least for some rotavirus and adenovirus antigen EIAs, the cut-off value set by the manufacturer may not permit an optimal differentiation between true-positive and -negative samples. By raising the cut-off value from 50 to 100%, the specificity of two rotavirus antigen and one adenovirus antigen EIA can be improved markedly without significant loss of sensitivity."
CD011926,0,16822087,0,Disordered pulmonary myofibroblast distribution and elastin expression in preterm infants with Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonitis.,"Respiratory colonization of preterm infants with Ureaplasma urealyticum is a significant risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease characterized by arrest of alveolar development, variable interstitial fibrosis, and disordered elastic fibers in the distal airspaces. As indicated in previous studies, moderate to severe fibrosis is a hallmark of pathology in the Ureaplasma-infected preterm lung. To further characterize the preterm lung's response to Ureaplasma, lung specimens from 4 gestational controls (GC), 12 other pneumonia and 5 Ureaplasma-infected infants were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), Hart's elastin staining, and in situ hybridization for tropoelastin (TE) expression. Cells positive for alphaSMA were observed in thickened, extensive bundles surrounding terminal airspaces in Ureaplasma and other pneumonia cases compared to individual myofibroblasts in GC. The myofibroblast pattern correlated with the severity of fibrosis, but not duration of ventilation. Transforming growth factor beta1 immunostaining was primarily localized to alveolar macrophages and was increased in Ureaplasma more than in other pneumonia cases. Elastic fibers and TE-expressing cells were spatially limited to emerging septal tips in GC. In pneumonia cases, increased deposition of elastic fibers was observed surrounding terminal airspaces, but TE expression was similar to GC. In Ureaplasma specimens, accumulation of elastic fibers correlated with duration of ventilation, and TE expression was extensive throughout the walls of terminal airspaces. These findings suggest that Ureaplasma is associated with alveolar macrophage TGFbeta1 immunostaining and myofibroblast proliferation contributing to abnormal septation, interstitial fibrosis, and a prolonged and strong elastogenic response in the preterm lung."

CD011926,0,20335418,0,Human picobirnaviruses identified by molecular screening of diarrhea samples.,"The global threat of (re)emerging infectious viruses requires a more effective approach regarding virus surveillance and diagnostic assays, as current diagnostics are often virus species specific and not able to detect highly divergent or unknown viruses. A systematic exploration of viruses that infect humans is the key to effectively counter the potential public health threat caused by new and emerging infectious diseases. The human gut is a known reservoir of a wide variety of microorganisms, including viruses. In this study, Dutch clinical diarrhea samples for which no etiological agent could be identified by available cell culture, serological, or nucleic acid-based tests were gathered. Large-scale molecular RNA virus screening based on host nucleic acid depletion, sequence-independent amplification, and sequencing of partially purified viral RNA from a limited number of clinical diarrhea samples revealed four eukaryotic virus species. Among the detected viruses were a rhinovirus and a new picobirnavirus variant. In total, approximately 20% of clinical diarrhea samples contained human picobirnavirus sequences. The Dutch picobirnaviruses belonged to different phylogenetic clades and did not group with other picobirnaviruses according to year of isolation or host species. Interestingly, the average age of patients infected with picobirnavirus was significantly higher than that of uninfected patients. Our data show that sequence-independent amplification of partially purified viral RNA is an efficient procedure for identification of known and highly divergent new RNA viruses in clinical diarrhea samples."

A total of 292 isolates of H. influenzae, recovered from a normally sterile site, were collected in the study period. The isolates were serotyped by slide agglutination and antibiotic susceptibility was determined. One hundred and eight isolates received after the year 2000 were serotyped by slide agglutination and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) capsule typing, and both methods were compared. After the introduction of the routine Hib vaccination, the incidence of H. influenzae disease in children under the age of 5 years has decreased by 87.6% and type b was replaced by non-typeable H. influenzae as the predominant serotype. The proportion of serotype b decreased from 85.3% in the pre-vaccination period to 13.0% in the vaccination period and the proportion of non-capsulated isolates increased from 12.0 to 85.2%. The study of genetic relatedness by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) demonstrated that the isolates of serotypes b and f were genetically homogeneous within the serotype. The results of our national surveillance showed that the vaccine has been very efficient in preventing Hib invasive disease in Slovenia. Nevertheless, we see a need for further monitoring of invasive H. influenzae infections at a national level."
CD011926,0,18390433,0,[Septicaemia with Capnocytophaga sputigena in a newborn child].,"We describe in this article a case of septicaemia with Capnocytophaga suptigena in a premature newborn child. The newborn child exhibited fever at birth, a light inflammatory syndrome and a respiratory failure. The germ was initially identified in the blood-culture of the newborn child by conventional techniques, and then confirmed by sequencing of the ARN 16S. After investigation, it was also found in the mother's vaginal sample. Capnocytophaga sputigena carried by the mother is certainly responsible for infection of the newborn child by ascending way. After antibiotherapy, both mother and child did not present aftereffects. This is the 16th case described in the literature; Capnocytophaga sputigena carried in vaginal area is responsible for preterm labor and for septicaemia associated to respiratory failure of the newborn child. It is thus important not to neglect this germ and to estimate its sensibility to antibiotics."

CD011926,0,18394752,0,Pertussis outbreak on a neonatal unit: identification of a healthcare worker as the likely source.,"We describe the investigation and containment of an outbreak of pertussis on a neonatal unit. Bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology were used to confirm suspected cases. Two infants with pertussis were identified and a nurse with prolonged cough was traced as the likely source. Control interventions included mass chemoprophylaxis of healthcare workers and patients and exclusion from work of healthcare workers with cough. The use of PCR allowed rapid assessment of the extent of the outbreak. This outbreak highlights the risk to hospitalised infants posed by circulation of Bordetella pertussis in young adults and illustrates the utility of PCR in rapidly assessing the extent of outbreaks. Prevention strategies such as universal vaccination of adolescents, or selective vaccination of healthcare workers, should be considered in the UK."
CD011926,0,26686811,0,Contamination of Australian newborn calf carcasses at slaughter with Clostridium difficile.,"In North America and Europe, reports of a genetic overlap between toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile isolated from humans, livestock and retail meat suggest that food-borne transmission may be occurring. We investigated the prevalence, concentration and genetic diversity of C. difficile on the carcasses (n = 300) and in the faeces (n = 30) of neonatal veal calves at three abattoirs in Australia in 2013. Selective culture (both direct and enrichment) was performed, and all isolates were characterized by PCR for the toxin genes tcdA, tcdB and cdtA/B and by PCR ribotyping. Prevalence of C. difficile was 25.3% (76/300) on carcasses and 60.0% (18/30) in faeces. Multiple PCR ribotypes (RT) were detected, with four binary toxin-positive RTs accounting for 70.3% (71/101) of isolates; 127 (A(+), B(+), CDT(+), 32.7%), 288 (A(-), B(-), CDT(+), 28.7%), 033 (A(-), B(-), CDT(+), 6.9%) and 126 (A(+), B(+), CDT(+), 2.0%). Viable counts of a subset of samples revealed detectable numbers of C. difficile in 66.7% (10/15) of faecal samples (range 2.0 × 10(3) to 2.3 × 10(6) CFU/mL, median count 2.5 × 10(4) CFU/mL) and in 16.7% (25/150) of carcase samples (range 3 to 33 CFU/cm(2), median count 7 CFU/cm(2)). These data further confirm that Australian neonatal veal calf carcasses are contaminated with potentially significant strains of C. difficile at slaughter."
CD011926,0,21538042,0,Chlamydia trachomatis infection during pregnancy associated with preterm delivery: a population-based prospective cohort study.,"Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection and may influence pregnancy outcome. This study was conducted to assess the effect of chlamydial infection during pregnancy on premature delivery and birthweight. Pregnant women attending a participating midwifery practice or antenatal clinic between February 2003 and January 2005 were eligible for the study. From 4,055 women self-administered questionnaires and urine samples, tested by PCR, were analysed for C. trachomatis infection. Pregnancy outcomes were obtained from midwives and hospital registries. Gestational ages and birthweights were analysed for 3,913 newborns. The C. trachomatis prevalence was 3.9%, but varied by age and socio-economic background. Chlamydial infection was, after adjustment for potential confounders, associated with preterm delivery before 32 weeks (OR 4.35 [95% CI 1.3, 15.2]) and 35 weeks gestation (OR 2.66 [95% CI 1.1, 6.5]), but not with low birthweight. Of all deliveries before 32 weeks and 35 weeks gestation 14.9% [95% CI 4.5, 39.5] and 7.4% [95% CI 2.5, 20.1] was attributable to C. trachomatis infection. Chlamydia trachomatis infection contributes significantly to early premature delivery and should be considered a public health problem, especially in young women and others at increased risk of C. trachomatis infection."

CD011926,0,20463159,0,Clinical and etiological characteristics of enterovirus 71-related diseases during a recent 2-year period in Korea.,"Human enterovirus 71 (EV 71) has caused large-scale outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), particularly in the Asian-Pacific region. In this study, we report a major outbreak of EV 71 infection in Korea and describe the clinical differences between EV 71 and non-EV 71 enterovirus infections. We prospectively enrolled patients with suspected viral infections during a recent 2-year period through a nationwide surveillance system. We identified 719 patients with suspected HFMD or herpangina using real-time PCR and genotyping based on VP1 sequence analysis. The major pathogen causing HFMD changed substantially from 2008 to 2009, with EV 71 becoming the most common cause of HFMD in Korea in 2009. We successfully identified the enteroviral genotypes for 218 of the 719 patients. Patients with EV 71 infections tended to be younger than those with non-EV 71 enteroviral infections and presented with HFMD and meningoencephalitis. In addition, the occurrence of fever, headache, and neck stiffness was significantly higher in patients with EV 71 infections. Multivariable analysis showed that for patients presenting with HFMD, fever, or a sore throat, each covariate was independently associated with EV 71 infection; the adjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals in parentheses) for these variables were 31.86 (10.04 to 101.09), 4.76 (1.71 to 13.25), and 0.18 (0.04 to 0.77), respectively. Our results indicate that EV 71 was a major cause of HFMD in Korea during the study period. In addition, we found that clinical symptoms may be helpful in the early identification of patients with EV 71 infections."
CD011926,0,23782067,0,Molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated over a 2-year period in a Qatari hospital from multinational patients.,"Global spread of epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an issue of increasing clinical concern especially problematic community-associated (CA) -MRSA. However, data regarding MRSA epidemiology in regions of the Middle East, including Qatar, are still insufficient. A representative subset of 61 MRSA isolates from multinational patients from hospital in Qatar during a 2-year period (2009/2010) was examined. Molecular characterization for MRSA isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), SCCmec, spa and dru typing, and PCR for the presence of the arginine catabolic mobile element and genes for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). Prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus isolated was 176/840 (21%). Of the 61 MRSA isolates examined, three (5%) represented hospital-acquired infection. By PFGE, 32 isolates (52%) were CA-MRSA USA300 (n = 4), USA400 (n = 3), USA1100/Southwest (SW) Pacific (n = 17) and ST80-MRSA-IV (n = 8) strains. The remaining isolates were well-known healthcare-associated EMRSA-15 (n = 8) and USA800 (n = 13). Three isolates were USA900, one was USA1200 and four were unrelated to any known strains in the international database. Unexpectedly, the USA900 isolates were all positive for PVL and USA400 isolates were PVL negative. Five of the eight EMRSA-15 isolates were PVL positive. ST80-MRSA-IV and USA300 strains exhibited typical dru types (dt10a and dt9g, respectively). Eleven different spa types were observed in this study. All USA300 isolates were arginine catabolic mobile element positive. The high prevalence of CA-MRSA, especially including USA300, in this setting underscores the importance of global epidemiological monitoring to better understand and hopefully help prevent the emergence and spread of these problem pathogens in patient populations."

The infant was prematurely delivered due to intractable labour. The mother had no history or clinical signs of genital infection before or during pregnancy. The infant's skin lesions were described as rough white-yellow plaques; a skin biopsy demonstrated calcified plaques and absent epidermis. HSV type 1 was later determined using PCR on the infant's skin biopsy and cerebral spinal fluid as well as the mother's vaginal swab and the placenta. Calcifications have already been described by Allee et al, alongside a diagnosis of HSV type 2. As is well known, the morbidity and mortality of congenital herpes infections are very high."

CD011926,0,20463154,0,Multicenter study of clinical performance of the 3M Rapid Detection RSV test.,"This multicenter study evaluated the clinical performance of the 3M Rapid Detection RSV test (3MRSV) compared to a composite reference standard of R-Mix culture and direct specimen immunofluorescence for detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The performance of the BinaxNOW RSV test was also evaluated using this reference standard. In a secondary analysis, discordant results were arbitrated using the Gen-Probe/Prodesse ProFlu+ reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay. Subjects were stratified into three groups as follows: group 1 (G1), all ages; G2, subjects <22 years old (FDA-cleared ages for 3MRSV testing); and G3, subjects <5 years old (FDA-cleared ages for BinaxNOW RSV testing). A total of 1,306 specimens (G1, n = 1,306; G2, n = 1,140; G3, n = 953) from subjects of all ages presenting with respiratory symptoms met study criteria for analysis. Sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values of 3MRSV for G1 were 86.5%, 95.8%, 91.4%, and 93.2%, respectively, and those for G2 were 87.3%, 95.6%, 92.4%, and 92.5%, respectively. For those samples analyzed by both 3MRSV and BinaxNOW, the 3MRSV was more sensitive (G1, 86.3%; G2, 87.2%; and G3, 89.9%) than was BinaxNOW (G1, 70.84%; G2, 72.0%; and G3, 72.4%) (P < 0.05). Specificities for RSV detection from nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirates and NP swabs for all groups were comparable for 3MRSV and BinaxNOW, but 3MRSV was less specific than BinaxNOW when nasal washes/aspirates were tested (P < 0.05). The 3MRSV assay performed well for the detection of RSV, and the overall assay performance was superior to that of BinaxNOW. The 3MRSV reader eliminated user misinterpretation and provided test result and quality control documentation."
CD011926,0,18190584,0,Distribution of genotypes and antibiotic resistance genes among invasive Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) isolates from Australasian patients belonging to different age groups.,"Serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance (AR) among group B streptococci (GBS) affect GBS disease prevention strategies, but vary among patient groups. A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) hybridisation assay was used to compare the distributions of GBS serotypes, serotype III subtypes and AR-associated genes among 666 invasive isolates from 663 patients, divided into five age groups: infants, early-onset (EO; 0-6 days) and late-onset (LO; 7-90 days); children (aged 3 months to 14 years); women of childbearing age (WCBA; aged 15-45 years); and other adults (males aged >15 years; females aged >45 years). Serotypes Ia and V and serosubtype III-1 accounted for 60% of infections. Serosubtype III-2, which corresponds to a virulent clone belonging to sequence type (ST)17, was relatively uncommon overall (7%), but was associated strongly with LO infant infections, in which it was significantly more common than in adult infections (25/104 (24%) vs. 9/392 (2%), p <0.0001) or in EO infections (25/104 (24%) vs. 14/155 (9%), p <0.005). Erythromycin resistance genes were found in 8% of all isolates (ermB 3%, ermA 2.5% and mefA/E 2%), in 11-15% of isolates of serotypes II and V and subtype III-1, but in none of the isolates of serosubtype III-2 (III-2, 0/49 vs. all others, 54/618 (9%), p <0.04). In summary, the virulent serosubtype III-2 was associated strongly with LO infant GBS infection, but was less likely than other serotypes or serosubtype III-1 to carry AR genes."
CD011926,0,21648230,0,Preventing neonatal group B streptococcal infection. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in some high-risk situations.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) are the leading cause of life-threatening neonatal bacterial infections in developed countries. The newborn is initially colonised during passage through the birth canal. Maternal vaginal carriage is usually asymptomatic. How safe and effective are strategies aimed at preventing severe neonatal GBS infection? To answer these questions, we conducted a review of the literature using the standard Prescrire methodology. In France, Group B streptococci are present in the vagina of about 10-15% of women towards the end of pregnancy. Mother-to-child transmission can occur when the membranes rupture, or during delivery. About one-third of infants born to mothers who carry Group B streptococci are colonised at birth. GBS colonisation rarely affects the newborn's health but, during the first 7 days of life, about 3% of colonised children develop a serious early-onset infection, particularly meningitis, which may be fatal or leave sequelae. Late-onset infections (after 7 days of life) do not appear to be linked to intrapartum colonisation. The risk of early neonatal GBS infection increases in cases of preterm delivery, maternal fever during delivery, and membrane rupture more than 18 hours before delivery. These situations account for 50% to 75% of early neonatal GBS infections. Several randomised trials suggest that intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis in women who carry Group B streptococci, from the onset of labour until delivery, reduces the risk of early-onset neonatal GBS infection from 4.7% to 0.4% (p = 0.02). Other antibiotic strategies are less well assessed or appear to be less effective. Penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) is the antibiotic of choice, while penicillin A (ampicillin or amoxicillin) is an alternative. In case of penicillin allergy, erythromycin or clindamycin are generally active against Group B streptococci and carry no particular risks for the infant. The greatest risk associated with penicillin, especially injectable forms, is an anaphylactic reaction, which can have severe consequences for both mother and child. The estimated frequency is about 5 cases per 10 000 treatments. The possible long-term adverse effects of antibiotic exposure during delivery are poorly documented in children. We found no randomised trials of standard vaginal screening for Group B streptococci between 35 and 38 weeks of gestation, or of a rapid PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test at the time of delivery. In a retrospective study conducted in the US, screening followed by antibiotic therapy if the results were positive was associated with a lower risk of early neonatal infection, but the methodology does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. The risk-benefit balance has not been determined in terms of neonatal mortality. Widespread implementation of screening guidelines coincided with a decline in the incidence of early neonatal GBS infections in several countries. In the United Kingdom, systematic antibiotic therapy is recommended in high-risk situations, without systematic screening for Group B streptococci. In practice, the first priority is to identify situations in which there is a high risk of neonatal GBS infection, and to administer antibiotics during labour, after screening for GBS carriage, if possible. Outside of these situations, the risk of an anaphylactic reaction must be minimised by choosing the prophylactic antibiotic based on maternal allergy history, and by avoiding antibiotic prophylaxis altogether if the mother has a history of anaphylaxis, whatever the cause."

CD011926,0,15941561,0,[Congenital or neonatal cytomegalovirus infection?].,"Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurs in about 1% of the newborns, but it is clinically unapparent in around 90% of the cases during the newborn period. This congenital infection may be the cause of neurological sequelae of variable severity, namely neuro-sensorial hearing loss. In most cases of hearing loss secondary to congenital CMV infection, the newborn was asymptomatic. The diagnosis of congenital CMV infection is made traditionally by culturing the virus from urine during the first three weeks of life. In the present case, the authors describe the situation of a two months old black female infant, admitted for irritability, vomiting and generalized convulsions. During investigation, the authors found lab results in favor of recent CMV infection. The imaging studies performed (cerebral ultrasound scan, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) were normal. As the infant was older than three weeks, it was not possible to make the diagnosis of congenital CMV infection by a positive urine sample. The diagnosis was made by a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction made on the Guthrie card, collected on the fifth day of life and archived in the national laboratory that centralizes the early diagnosis of phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism. The authors review the epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis and prevention of the congenital CMV infection, giving a perspective of the magnitude of this disease, its sequelae and the new diagnostic methods available, even when the infection is clinically unapparent on the newborn period."

CD011926,0,1452682,0,Stability of dried blood spot specimens for detection of human immunodeficiency virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction.,"Blood sampling on filter paper has many advantages for the detection of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, if the method is to be widely used, an assessment of its performance under field conditions is required. To simulate conditions in the field, 50-microliters aliquots of whole blood containing low levels of HIV proviral DNA (4 to 1,024 copies per 100,000 nucleated cells) were spotted onto filter paper; dried; and subjected to heat, humidity, and prolonged storage at room temperature. After exposure, the DNA was recovered and amplified with primers to human leukocyte antigen DQ alpha- and HIV-specific sequences. Treatment at 37 degrees C and 60% humidity for 7 days, storage for 12 weeks at 22 degrees C, and freeze-thawing twice had no adverse effect on PCR reactivity when compared with the results obtained with reference spots stored at -20 degrees C. The lower limits of HIV detection in all tests ranged from 4 to 16 HIV copies per 100,000 cells. Fixation in 70% ethanol improved the amplification of low levels of HIV DNA and reduced biohazard risks. These findings suggest that dried blood spots will provide a powerful new resource for testing for HIV by PCR, especially in remote areas where refrigeration and immediate sample processing are unavailable."

Thirteen months following a liver transplant for CPS-1 defect, a 15-month-old boy presented with fevers, anemia, and growth retardation. Abdominal CT scan showed splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy. Histology of chest wall lymph nodes revealed a mixed CD3+ T-cell and CD20+ B-cell population with atretic germinal centers consistent with multicentric Castleman disease. Qualitative DNA PCR detected HHV-8 in the resected lymph node and in the blood, supporting the diagnosis. Immunosuppression was tapered, and he was transitioned from tacrolimus to sirolimus. His graft function remained stable, and repeat imaging showed regression of the lymphadenopathy. The child is living one yr after Castleman disease diagnosis with a well-functioning graft. Castleman disease is a potential complication of solid organ transplant and HHV-8 infection. Reduction in immunosuppression and switch to sirolimus may be an effective strategy to treat this condition."
CD011926,0,8135556,0,Bronchoalveolar lavage.,"Bronchoalveolar lavage has a well established role in the diagnosis of pulmonary infections, particularly those due to opportunistic organisms in an immunocompromised host. Recent studies of infants and adults with inflammatory lung disease have helped our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these disorders and their responses to treatment. With increasing recognition that pulmonary events in utero and in early infancy are important in the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as asthma, studies of the lung's responses to various environmental insults in this population might guide us to developing effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. Bronchoalveolar lavage is one method for assessing a number of pulmonary components and may be useful in this regard, particularly if combined with new methods for examining inflammatory responses, such as those utilising the polymerase chain reaction to assess cellular expression for inflammatory cytokines and growth factors."

CD011926,0,21439999,0,Mandatory reporting and improvements in diagnosing Clostridium difficile infection: an incompatible dichotomy?,"Toxin enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) are inadequate for the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) when used alone. In September 2010 we replaced toxin EIA with a two-step algorithm, testing first with glutamate dehydrogenase and confirming with polymerase chain reaction for toxin B gene. We compared this to the gold standard of toxigenic culture, observing a positive predictive value of 96% (laboratory prevalence of 4.7%). There was no deterioration in turnaround time but there was a decrease of 11% in repeat specimens sent from the same patients. The improved performance of the algorithm increased the laboratory positivity rate from 2.2% to 5.6%. This led to an increase in our Trust CDI rate reported under the Health Protection Agency's mandatory surveillance scheme. We investigated whether the change was due to increasing nosocomial transmission, environmental contamination or consumption of antimicrobials, but found no evidence of this. We conclude that it probably resulted from the change in testing algorithm. Although we have improved testing and enhanced patient safety, we are likely to be unfairly financially penalised because of our apparent (but not real) increase in CDI rates. Assessment of CDI rates should take testing methodology into account and national policies should be revised to reflect this."

Serum samples were tested using an enzyme immunoassay. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect and characterize HAV RNA, and sequencing was performed. Anti-HAV antibodies and IgM anti-HAV antibodies were detected, respectively, in 89.5% (374/418) and 10.5% (44/418) of the individuals tested. Acute HAV infection in children was independently correlated with crawling (p < 0.05). In 56.8% (25/44) of the IgM anti-HAV-positive individuals and in 33.3% (5/15) of the IgM anti-HAV-negative individuals presenting clinical symptoms, HAV RNA was detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed co-circulation of subgenotypes IA and IB in 93.3% (28/30) of the amplified samples. In present study, we verify that 79% (30/38) of children IgM anti-HAV-positive were asymptomatic. In child care centers, this asymptomatic spread is a more serious problem, promoting the infection of young children, who rarely show signs of infection. Therefore, vaccinating children below the age of two might prevent the asymptomatic spread of hepatitis A."
CD011926,0,3020777,0,In situ hybridization for the detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Application of biotinylated CMV-DNA probes on paraffin-embedded specimens.,"Five autopsy cases of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections were studied. Conventional light microscopy disclosed characteristic cytopathic effects in lungs, kidneys, and brain. In one case, electron microscopy was carried out and revealed typical herpesvirus particles. In situ hybridization was done with biotin-labeled CMV-DNA probes and an avidin-alkaline phosphatase detection system. 4/5 cases were observed to contain hybridizing cells in different organs. Intensity of hybridization was related to the severity of CMV infection, roughly estimated by counting cytomegalic cells. In addition to cytomegalic cells, a high number of normal-looking epithelial and mesenchymal cell types were positive. These latter cells showed nuclear hybridizations in contrast to cytomegalic cells which hybridized both within the nuclei and the cell bodies. This modified in situ hybridization procedure is a rapid and valuable tool for the detection and final demonstration of virus infection, and will be of particular help for the examination of paraffin-embedded specimens."

A syndrome of permanent neonatal diabetes along with primary microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern associated with severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy was recently described in two independent reports in which disease-causing homozygous mutations were identified in the immediate early response-3 interacting protein-1 (IER3IP1) gene. We report here an affected male born to a non-consanguineous couple who was noted to have insulin-requiring permanent neonatal diabetes, microcephaly, and generalized seizures. He was also found to have cortical blindness, severe developmental delay and numerous dysmorphic features. He experienced a slow improvement but not abrogation of seizure frequency and severity on numerous anti-epileptic agents. His clinical course was further complicated by recurrent respiratory tract infections and he died at 8 years of age. Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA from the proband and parents. He was found to be a compound heterozygote with two different mutations in IER3IP1: p.Val21Gly (V21G) and a novel frameshift mutation p.Phe27fsSer*25. IER3IP1 is a highly conserved protein with marked expression in the cerebral cortex and in beta cells. This is the first reported case of compound heterozygous mutations within IER3IP1 resulting in neonatal diabetes. The triad of microcephaly, generalized seizures, and permanent neonatal diabetes should prompt screening for mutations in IER3IP1. As mutations in genes such as NEUROD1 and PTF1A could cause a similar phenotype, next-generation sequencing approaches-such as exome sequencing reported here-may be an efficient means of uncovering a diagnosis in future cases."

Seven of nine macaques inoculated with neurovirulent simian imunodeficiency virus (SIVmac ) developed AIDS within 3 months. Four of these had clinically obvious neurological disease and extensive conduction defects in the form of latency increases in evoked potential (EP) responses. Neuropathologically, all four animals had disseminated white matter disease in the form of multifocal, perivascular and nodular parenchymal mononuclear cell infiltrates, along with extensive involvement of the cortical grey matter, leptomeninges and intracranial portions of cranial nerves. A brisk multinucleated giant cell (MGC) response was a frequent accompaniment in the affected areas. Three of the animals in this group also showed spongiform vacuolation in the occipital grey matter, a lesion described only rarely in HIV encephalitis. In the remaining three animals, there was only minimal evidence of overt neurological impairment or conduction defects. These animals had only mild to moderate neuropathological changes and lesions were virtually confined to the white matter regions of the brain. MGC responses were rare or absent in the CNS of these animals. Neuropathological findings in this SIVmac model have therefore shown good correlation with the severity of clinical and neurophysiological changes, and are reminiscent of HIV-1 encephalitis. More importantly, white matter involvement was a consistent finding in the affected macaques, regardless of the duration and severity of disease, or type of virus inoculated, suggesting an unusual susceptibility for lentiviral infection in these regions of the macaque CNS."
CD011926,0,11782931,0,Enteroviral meningitis in Northern Jordan: prevalence and association with clinical findings.,"During the summer-autumn of 1999, 390 specimens of cerebrospinal fluid were taken from infants and children younger than 15 years of age. They were suspected of having meningitis and were admitted to Princess Rahma Hospital, Northern Jordan. They were investigated for the presence of enteroviruses using shell vial culture and indirect immunofluorescence assays. Most cases (46.9%) occurred in children younger than 1 year of age in which males represented 71.9%. The common symptoms were fever, vomiting, and headache. Enteroviruses were isolated from 32 (8.2%) cases, coxsackievirus B types 2, 4, and 5 from 15 (46.9%) cases, and echovirus 9 (31.3%) was the most common identified serotype. The virus isolation rate was directly proportional to the number of leukocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, enteroviral isolation was demonstrated in 4 (12.5%) of 32 cerebrospinal fluid specimens without pleocytosis. Leukocyte differential count revealed a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells in 71.4% of the cases. Hospitalization ranged from 1 day to 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The majority of enterovirus-infected patients (88.9%) were treated with at least one type of antibiotic. These results emphasize the importance of shell vial culture assay for diagnosing enteroviruses, especially in laboratories that do not have access to advanced techniques such as polymerase chain reaction."

Examining correlates of cervical and vaginal HIV shedding is, therefore, essential for the development of strategies to interrupt HIV transmission. This article presents the rationale for using detection of HIV in the female genital tract as a marker of infectivity, and briefly describes methods for detecting HIV-1 and HIV-2 in cervical or vaginal fluids. Findings from studies incorporating the measurement of HIV in the female genital tract are reviewed, placing particular emphasis on issues relevant to epidemiological studies of HIV transmission."
CD011926,0,18461625,0,Comparison between the clinical and laboratory features of enterovirus and West Nile virus infections.,"The seasonality and clinical features of enterovirus (EV) infections overlap with those of West Nile virus (WNV). The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of EV detection in patients being tested for WNV and to look for features that could be used to distinguish between infections with these two viruses. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) for EV was performed on all plasma samples submitted for WNV testing in 2003 and 2004. Demographics, clinical features, and laboratory results for patients with documented EV viremia were compared with those for patients with confirmed WNV infection (as diagnosed by NAT and/or serology). NAT for EV was positive on 50 of 1,784 serum or plasma samples submitted for WNV testing (2.8%). Clinical information was compared for 45 patients with EV viremia and 214 patients with WNV infection. Patients with EV viremia were younger and less likely to have heart disease or a travel history (P<0.05). The EV viremia cases were distributed throughout the whole province while the WNV cases were predominantly in the southern part of the province. Symptoms were remarkably similar, although patients with WNV infection were more likely to have anorexia, dizziness, rash, and cranial nerve palsy (P<0.05). There are no consistent differences in the features of WNV infection and enteroviral viremia so diagnostic tests for both viruses should be performed when WNV is present in local mosquitoes."

CD011926,0,17505663,0,"High prevalence of malaria infection in Amazonas State, Venezuela.","This study was carried out to determine the incidence of malaria in an endemic region of Amazonas State, Venezuela. For this, 200 random samples were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals from San Fernando de Atabapo and Santa Barbara. Epidemiological factors were related to malaria infection, which was diagnosed by microscopy observation and amplification of the 18S rDNA sequence by PCR. Malaria prevalence in these populations was 28.5%, whilst P. vivax and P. falciparum prevalences were 12 and 17%, respectively. No infection by P. malariae was found. A mixed infection was found on an asymptomatic individual. Prevalence patterns differed between age groups depending on the Plasmodium species. We found that 34.8% of the P. vivax and 15.2% of the P. falciparum infections were asymptomatic. The use of nets was helpful to prevent P. vivax infection, but did not protect against P. falciparum infection. The results suggest the presence of more than one mosquito vector in the area, displaying a differential pattern of infection for each Plasmodium species. There appear to be risk factors associated with malaria infections in some individuals. The population based approach and PCR diagnosis improved the accuracy of the statistical analysis in the study."

One of three different aminoglycosides was administered to each subgroup of ten preterm and ten fullterm infants. Changes in tubular function in groups of ten preterm and ten fullterm infants who were not given antibiotics were also compared. The mean gestational age for preterm infants from 32.5 to 33.6 weeks and for fullterm infants between 39.2 and 39.5 weeks. The renal tubular function was assessed by examining the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), potassium (FEK), phosphorus (FEP), magnesium (FEMg) and uric acid (FEUA) as well as by the urinary excretion of calcium as the calcium/creatinine (UCa/UCr) ratio. Gentamicin affected the normal plasma creatinine (PCr) decline in both treated groups (fullterm and preterm). Disturbances in FENa and UCa/UCr were more pronounced in treated preterm than in fullterm infants especially after netilmicin and gentamicin administration. FEMg was significantly affected in preterm infants treated with gentamicin. The findings of this study indicate that the effect of aminoglycosides on tubular function is dependent upon kidney maturity and the type of the aminoglycoside used for therapy."

CD011926,0,25385115,0,"Pharmacokinetics, microbial response, and pulmonary outcomes of multidose intravenous azithromycin in preterm infants at risk for Ureaplasma respiratory colonization.","The study objectives were to refine the population pharmacokinetics (PK) model, determine microbial clearance, and assess short-term pulmonary outcomes of multiple-dose azithromycin treatment in preterm infants at risk for Ureaplasma respiratory colonization. Fifteen subjects (7 of whom were Ureaplasma positive) received intravenous azithromycin at 20 mg/kg of body weight every 24 h for 3 doses. Azithromycin concentrations were determined in plasma samples obtained up to 168 h post-first dose by using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Respiratory samples were obtained predose and at three time points post-last dose for Ureaplasma culture, PCR, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and cytokine concentration determinations. Pharmacokinetic data from these 15 subjects as well as 25 additional subjects (who received either a single 10-mg/kg dose [n = 12] or a single 20-mg/kg dose [n = 13]) were analyzed by using a nonlinear mixed-effect population modeling (NONMEM) approach. Pulmonary outcomes were assessed at 36 weeks post-menstrual age and 6 months adjusted age. A 2-compartment model with all PK parameters allometrically scaled on body weight best described the azithromycin pharmacokinetics in preterm neonates. The population pharmacokinetics parameter estimates for clearance, central volume of distribution, intercompartmental clearance, and peripheral volume of distribution were 0.15 liters/h · kg(0.75), 1.88 liters · kg, 1.79 liters/h · kg(0.75), and 13 liters · kg, respectively. The estimated area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h (AUC24)/MIC90 value was ∼ 4 h. All posttreatment cultures were negative, and there were no drug-related adverse events. One Ureaplasma-positive infant died at 4 months of age, but no survivors were hospitalized for respiratory etiologies during the first 6 months (adjusted age). Thus, a 3-day course of 20 mg/kg/day intravenous azithromycin shows preliminary efficacy in eradicating Ureaplasma spp. from the preterm respiratory tract."

CD011926,0,20121829,0,Rhinoviruses delayed the circulation of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus in France.,"In contrast to the experience in other European countries, the onset of the A(H1N1)2009 influenza virus epidemic was unexpectedly slow in France during the first part of autumn 2009. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that intense circulation of rhinoviruses might have reduced the probability of infection by A(H1N1)2009 virus at the beginning of autumn 2009. Systematic analysis for the detection of A(H1N1)2009 (H1N1) and human rhinovirus (HRV) was performed by RT-PCR from week 36 to week 48 on respiratory samples sent to the diagnostic laboratory by the paediatric hospital (n = 2121). Retrospective analysis of the obtained data, using 2 x 2 contingency tables with Fisher's exact test, revealed evidence of an inverse relationship between HRV and H1N1 detection. Between weeks 36 and 48 of 2009, both HRV and H1N1 were detected but in different time frames. HRV dispersed widely during early September, peaking at the end of the month, whereas the H1N1 epidemic began during mid-October and was still active at the end of this survey. During the co-circulation period of these two respiratory viruses (weeks 43-46), HRV detection appeared to reduce the likelihood of H1N1 detection in the same sample (OR = 0.08-0.24 p <0.0001). These results support the hypothesis that HRV infections can reduce the probability of A(H1N1) infection. This viral interference between respiratory viruses could have affected the spread of the H1N1 viruses and delayed the influenza pandemic at the beginning of autumn in France."

Here, we analyzed the DMBT1 expression in the fetal gastrointestinal system depending on gestational age and in patients with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), volvulus, intestinal perforation (IP), or herniation, representing typical diseases of preterm and term infants. We used immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization to detect DMBT1 protein and mRNA in fetal tissues, supplemented by postmortem analysis of DMBT1 expression in died newborns and analysis of surgically removed tissues. DMBT1 expression is detectable in the early developmental stages of the gastrointestinal system. In NEC, volvulus, IP, or herniation, characterized by high systemic inflammatory responses, DMBT1 expression is strongly increased. High DMBT1 expression was also found in the bile ducts of older infants with sepsis or cholestasis. The study shows that DMBT1 expression is observed in the developing gastrointestinal system and up-regulated in infants with NEC, volvulus, IP, and herniation. DMBT1 may play a role in epithelial differentiation and local innate immunity during neonatal inflammatory bowel processes."

In this prospective study we compared the results of culture and PCR testing of vaginal and rectal samples collected by nursing staff when women were in labor. Patients' charts were also reviewed to obtain relevant information about pregnancy risk factors. Our results demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.5%, 96.1%, 86.4%, and 97.4%, respectively, for rapid PCR. Of the 196 women evaluated, 29 (14.8%) presented with unknown GBS status, 11 (37.9%) of whom received unnecessary intrapartum antibiotics. The rapid real-time PCR test was robust and was able to reliably detect the presence of GBS in women in labor within 1 h of specimen submission to the laboratory. We recommend that the rapid PCR test be targeted to women who present in labor with unknown GBS status. In cases where the laboratory does not offer 24-h availability of testing, sample collection followed by PCR testing the next morning is still valuable and provides reliable results 24 to 48 h faster than culture and will aid appropriate decision-making regarding continuing or stopping antibiotics for neonates of women with unknown GBS status."

The closest sequence relationships of the neutralization antigens of these strains were to the VP4 protein of P1A[8]G1 strain KU (93.3% identity in amino acids 11 to 282) and to the VP7 protein of G serotype 5 strain OSU (87.6% identity in amino acids 8 to 232). Based on VP7 sequence differences, we designed dig-probes that allowed us to discriminate porcine OSU-like strains from G5 strains isolated from Brazilian infants. The genetic relationships of two P[8]G5 isolates to other rotavirus genogroups were analyzed by RNA-RNA hybridization with [32P]-GTP probes representative of serotypes P1A[8]G1 (Wa), P[8]G3 (AU17), and P9[7]G5 (OSU). The Brazilian P[8]G5 strains showed sequence homology with genes of Wa-like and OSU-like strains, suggesting that these two strains were naturally occurring reassortants between members of the Wa and porcine rotavirus genogroups. The identification of these strains in diverse geographic areas of Brazil underscores their stability and demonstrates the emergence of clinically important rotavirus diarrhea strains by reassortment."
CD011926,0,8668848,0,"Cytomegalovirus pneumonia: presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.","Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia has been one of the most important opportunistic infections in the immunocompromised host. The disease is particularly severe in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients, with an almost 100% mortality rate in untreated patients. During the last few years, major advances in diagnostic techniques that allow more rapid detection of CMV in bronchoalveolar lavage have resulted in earlier diagnosis and thereby earlier commencement of therapy. Furthermore, the diagnosis of CMV infection in the blood using antigenemia assay or polymerase chain reaction has allowed the development of preemptive therapy strategies, substantially decreasing the risk for the development of CMV pneumonia. Ganciclovir or foscarnet combined with intravenous immunoglobulin has improved the outcome in some patients with established disease. However, resistance of CMV to antiviral agents is becoming an increasingly important problem, particularly in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
CD011926,0,23797721,0,"Diagnosis of congenital CMV using PCR performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded placental tissue.","Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection may be asymptomatic until hearing loss manifests in childhood. Because diagnosis of congenital CMV requires viral detection within an infant's first 21 days of life, CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) placental tissue provides a unique opportunity to identify congenital exposure in cases in which CMV is not initially suspected. To assess the utility of this approach, a database of all CMV cultures performed from July 2001 to March 2012 was used to identify infants in whom urine CMV cultures were obtained within 100 days of life. Corresponding placentas were then identified through the pathology database. The database was also queried to identify placentas in which CMV immunohistochemical analysis had been performed. CMV PCR was positive in FFPE placental tissue from 100% (5/5) of cases in which the first urine culture collected before the first 21 days of life was positive. Placentas from 20 infants with negative CMV urine cultures were CMV PCR negative. Interestingly, CMV was detected in 12.5% (1/8) of placentas in which the first CMV-positive urine culture was collected after the first 21 days of life. Furthermore, 4% (1/26) of placentas with chronic villitis by histology (no urine cultures available) were CMV PCR positive. In the 10 CMV PCR-positive placentas, including 3 cases of fetal demise, CMV immunohistochemistry was positive in just 6 cases. These results suggest that the confirmation of CMV exposure in utero by PCR of FFPE placental tissue provides a useful adjunct to histologic evaluation and may identify infants requiring close clinical follow-up."

Of the total of 441 biological materials, T. gondii DNA was detected in 5.2 %; it was positive in the following samples: blood (n = 6), blood from newborns (2), biopsies (2) and samples of progenitor cells (2) (from candidates for bone marrow transplantation). DNA of T. gondii was also revealed in 11 samples (8.3 %) of 120 cases of pregnant women during prenatal examinations. A positive result in the blood was also found in two cases of newborn babies from mothers who were infected in later pregnancy. The positive PCR examination was confirmed by serological methods (ELISA and complement fixation test). Agreement of PCR results and the detection of antibodies against toxoplasma was found in 83.3 %. Rapid PCR examination for the confirmation of acute parasitemia T. gondii is particularly important for the patients in whom the infection may cause serious consequences (e.g., for fetus in pregnant women or for patients suffering from imunosuppression)."

The diagnosis of rotavirus infection was on the basis of a set of clinical, epidemiological data and the results of para-clinical and bacteriological studies and data of detection of rotavirus antigen strain. Genotyping of rotavirus group A was performed by PCR 269 faecal samples. For rotavirus infection is characterized by the following clinical symptoms: intestinal disorders, symptoms of intoxication, signs of dehydration. Clinical manifestation of rotavirus infection is closely correlated with indicators of leukogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the degree of metabolic acidosis. The presence of concomitant bacterial infection burden for rotavirus, but the presence of conditionally pathogenic flora practically did not influence on the clinical manifestation of the disease. The longest duration of diarrhea was observed in patients with rotavirus gastroenteritis was caused by a strain with genotype PCR they often occurred in children older than 2 years (t=3,4; p<0.01)). Special scheme has been developed for predicting the course of rotavirus gastroenteritis, including the availability of mix infection, to determine the severity of the pathological process a specially designed scale."

CD011926,0,24396135,0,Early-onset neonatal sepsis.,"Early-onset sepsis remains a common and serious problem for neonates, especially preterm infants. Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the most common etiologic agent, while Escherichia coli is the most common cause of mortality. Current efforts toward maternal intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis have significantly reduced the rates of GBS disease but have been associated with increased rates of Gram-negative infections, especially among very-low-birth-weight infants. The diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is based on a combination of clinical presentation; the use of nonspecific markers, including C-reactive protein and procalcitonin (where available); blood cultures; and the use of molecular methods, including PCR. Cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and cell surface antigens, including soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM) and CD64, are also being increasingly examined for use as nonspecific screening measures for neonatal sepsis. Viruses, in particular enteroviruses, parechoviruses, and herpes simplex virus (HSV), should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Empirical treatment should be based on local patterns of antimicrobial resistance but typically consists of the use of ampicillin and gentamicin, or ampicillin and cefotaxime if meningitis is suspected, until the etiologic agent has been identified. Current research is focused primarily on development of vaccines against GBS."

This pathogen exhibits extensive genetic variability in the genes that encode structural envelope glycoproteins, regulatory proteins, and proteins that contribute to immune evasion. However, the role of specific viral strains in the outcome of congenital CMV infection is unclear. Variation in the UL55 gene encoding glycoprotein B (gB), the UL144 gene encoding TNF α-like receptor, and the US28 gene encoding β-chemokine receptor was determined in 60 newborn infants with congenital CMV infection and 90 infants with postnatal or undefined CMV infection. CMV polymorphisms were studied in relation to disease outcome and viral load. Genotyping was performed by a sequencing analysis of PCR-amplified fragments, and the viral load was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The results demonstrated that (1) the UL55 and US28 genotype distributions were similar among the group of congenital and postnatal CMV infection; (2) the UL144 B1 genotype was more prevalent in congenital than in postnatal infection and was detected in 70% of newborns with asymptomatic congenital infection; and (3) none of the examined genotype was significantly linked with symptomatic CMV infection. No relationship was observed between genotype and viral load. The results revealed that UL55, UL144, and US28 polymorphisms are not associated with the outcome of CMV infection in infants, but the presence of UL144 B1 genotype might be virological marker of asymptomatic infection at birth."

CD011926,0,16525710,0,"Regulation of vascular smooth muscle proliferation and migration by beta2-chimaerin, a non-protein kinase C phorbol ester receptor.","The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) are important aspects of atherogenesis. Activated growth factor signaling in injured vessels subsequently promotes a number of intracellular events resulting in the phenotypic modulation of SMC. Here, we investigated the role of beta2-chimaerin, a non-protein kinase C phorbol ester receptor with Rac-GTPase-activating protein activity, in growth factor-stimulated SMC. The endogenous expression of beta2-chimaerin was detected in cultured human SMC by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Next, the overexpression of HA-tagged wild-type human beta2-chimaerin was attempted using cultured rat SMC with a recombinant adenovirus (Adv-beta2-Chim). Adv-LZ encoding beta-galactosidase (LacZ) was used as the control. The proliferation of SMC stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB, 10 ng/ml), as measured by cell-counting and 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine incorporation assay, was suppressed by infection with Adv-beta2-Chim (50-200 MOI), but not with control viruses. PDGF-induced SMC migration was inhibited by approximately 25% after infection with Adv-beta2-Chim (200 MOI) using a modified Boyden's chamber assay with a fibronectin-coated membrane. Confocal microscopy revealed that PDGF stimulation altered the sub-cellular localization of beta2-chimaerin. The administration of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate also induced changes in the sub-cellular localization of beta2-chimaerin, which was not affected by a presence of the PKC inhibitor (GF109203X). Finally, PDGF-induced Rac1 activation was found to be inhibited in the Adv-beta2-Chim-infected cells. Thus, we demonstrated that beta2-chimaerin regulates the proliferation and migration of SMC downstream of growth factor signaling pathway via the regulation of Rac1 activity. The signaling mediated by beta2-chimaerin may play a role in the regulation of SMC phenotypes, thereby implicating human atherogenesis."

The aim of this study was to compare four distinct detection technologies for the identification of pathogens in stools from children under 5 years of age in The Gambia, Mali, Kenya, and Bangladesh. The children were identified, using currently accepted clinical protocols, as either controls or cases with moderate to severe diarrhea. A total of 3,610 stool samples were tested by established clinical culture techniques: 3,179 DNA samples by the Universal Biosensor assay (Ibis Biosciences, Inc.), 1,466 DNA samples by the GoldenGate assay (Illumina), and 1,006 DNA samples by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes.

Overall, the standard culture methods detected Shigella spp., EPEC, ETEC, and EAEC in smaller proportions of the samples than either of the methods based on detection of the virulence genes from DNA in whole stools. The GoldenGate method revealed the greatest agreement with the other methods. The agreement among methods was higher in cases than in controls.

CD011926,0,16825509,1,Evaluating the near-term infant for early onset sepsis: progress and challenges to consider with 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction testing.,"Although the rate of early onset sepsis in the near-term neonate is low (one to eight of 1,000 cases), the rate of mortality and morbidity is high. As a result, infants receive multiple, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, many for up to 7 days despite blood cultures showing no growth. Maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and small blood volume collections from infants are cited as reasons for the lack of confidence in negative culture results. Incorporating an additional, more rapid test could facilitate a more timely diagnosis in these infants. To this end, a 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was compared to blood culturing for use as a tool in evaluating early onset sepsis. Of 1,751 neonatal intensive care unit admissions that were screened, 1,233 near-term infants met inclusion criteria. Compared to culture, PCR demonstrated excellent analytical specificity (1,186 of 1,216, 97.5%) and negative predictive value (1,186 of 1,196, 99.2%); however, PCR failed to detect a significant number of culture-proven cases.

We postulated that transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favoured by the presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective substances in breastmilk, or both factors. 215 HIV-1-infected women were enrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 months, and 18 months post partum. HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were assayed by western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with protein G. In the 15-day and 6-month samples, we sought viral genome in milk cells by a double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers (gag, pol, and env). HIV-1 infection in the offspring was defined according to serological and clinical criteria. At 15 days, 6 months, and 18 months post partum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95%, 98%, and 97% of breastmilk samples, IgA in 23%, 28%, and 41%, and IgM in 66%, 78%, and 41%. In children who survived longer than 18 months, the probability of infection was associated with lack of persistence of IgM and IgA in their mothers' milk (adjusted chi 2 for trend, p = 0.01 for IgM and p = 0.05 for IgA). The presence of HIV-1-infected cells in the milk 15 days post partum was strongly predictive of HIV-1 infection in the child, by both univariate (p < 0.05) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.01). The combination of HIV-1-infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM response was the strongest predictor of infection. HIV-1 infection in breastfed children born to infected mothers is associated with the presence of integrated viral DNA in the mothers' milk cells.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen for both hMPV and other common respiratory viruses in 2613 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from children with lower respiratory tract infections from September 2007 to February 2011 (a period of 3.5 years). The demographics and clinical presentations of patients infected with different genotypes of hMPV were compared. A total of 135 samples were positive for hMPV (positive detection rate: 5.2%). Co-infection with other viruses was observed in 45.9% (62/135) of cases, and human bocavirus was the most common additional respiratory virus. The most common symptoms included cough, fever, and wheezing. The M gene was sequenced for 135 isolates; of these, genotype A was identified in 72.6% (98/135) of patients, and genotype B was identified in 27.4% (37/135) of patients. The predominant genotype of hMPV changed over the 3.5-year study period from genotype A2b to A2b or B1 and then to predominantly B1. Most of clinical features were similar between patients infected with different hMPV genotypes. These results suggested that hMPV is an important viral pathogen in pediatric patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection in Changsha. The hMPV subtypes A2b and B1 were found to co-circulate. The different hMPV genotypes exhibit similar clinical characteristics."
CD011926,0,16730386,0,Characterization of a collection of Enterobacter sakazakii isolates from environmental and food sources.,"Enterobacter sakazakii has emerged as a rare cause of neonatal meningitis, septicemia and enterocolitis. Contaminated infant milk formula (IMF) has been identified as one infection route. A small number of clinical outbreaks have been epidemiologically linked to IMF contaminated post-pasteurization during manufacture and/or mishandled when reconstituted. Currently no agreed standardized typing protocol has been developed to trace E. sakazakii. The objectives of this study were to apply biochemical and genetic methods to characterize 51 environmental and food E. sakazakii isolates and 6 E. sakazakii type strains. Isolates were presumptively identified using biochemical profiles based on API 20E and ID32E methods and by culture on differential selective Druggan Forsythe Iversen (DFI) agar. Identification was subsequently confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All but one of the isolates was identified as E. sakazakii by biochemical profiling. One isolate was identified as Escherichia vulneris by ID 32E and as Pantoea agglomerans by API 20E. All isolates produced green/blue colonies on DFI medium characteristic of this organism. Real time PCR could differentiate between E. sakazakii, Enterobacter spp. and other Enterobacteriacae. Analysis of RAPD banding patterns revealed 3 major clusters of E. sakazakii. There was a large degree of diversity noted amongst the remaining isolates. Our findings indicate that RAPD may be applied as a useful and reliable tool for direct comparison of E. sakazakii isolates providing traceability through the infant formula food chain."

In order to simplify M/emm typing, we designed two multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) formats capable of identifying the most frequent GAS M/emm types involved in invasive infections and antimicrobial resistance. A heptaplex PCR procedure was first developed in a conventional format coupled with gel electrophoresis to identify emm types 1, 3, 4, 6, 12, 28, and 89, based on the size of the amplification products. The other method, designed to identify the same seven emm types, together with emm11, was based on a real-time PCR format coupled with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, allowing the rapid typing of large strain collections."

We have developed a nested multiplex PCR targeting five different genes for differential diagnosis of typhoidal pathogens which has been optimized to be directly applicable on clinical blood samples. Of 42 multiplex PCR-positive blood samples, 26, nine, and two were Vi-positive S. Typhi, Vi-negative S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A, respectively, and five patients were found to have mixed infection. Seventeen patients grew Salmonella from blood culture and the remaining 25 were positive in the Salmonella-specific PCR. Tests with several common pathogens confirmed the specificity of the assay. We conclude that the proposed multiplex PCR is rapid, sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of typhoidal pathogens directly from blood samples."

GBS strains of CPS type III were the most prevalent among infants (44% in those with early-onset disease, 75% in those with late-onset disease), while type V strains were most frequently isolated from adult patients (26% in patients≥19 years old). We next investigated the presence in our collection of GBS strains belonging to the hypervirulent multilocus sequence typing clonal complex 17 (CC17). We used a PCR test described as specific for the detection of CC17 strains, which targets the gene encoding the major virulence factor HvgA. We identified 91 hvgA-positive strains; of these, 88 were CPS type III, 2 were CPS type IV, and 1 was CPS type V. Using whole-genome sequencing, we showed that the two hvgA-positive CPS type IV strains are CC17 strains which underwent capsular switching. However, sequence analysis revealed that the hvgA-positive CPS type V strain does not belong to CC17 but instead is a bona fide CC1 strain which acquired hvgA, probably by recombination from a CC17 donor. Our findings underline the importance of recombination in GBS pathogenesis and caution against the use of single-gene-based PCR tests to detect CC17 GBS strains."

Detection of these infections is challenging because of the infection's long incubation period and patients' recall bias. Nevertheless, the complex food market might lead to reemergence of hepatitis A virus outside of disease-endemic areas. To assess the role of food as a source of infection, we combined routine surveillance with real-time strain sequencing in the Netherlands during 2008-2010. Virus RNA from serum of 248 (59%) of 421 reported case-patients could be sequenced. Without typing, foodborne transmission was suspected for only 4% of reported case-patients. With typing, foodborne transmission increased to being the most probable source of infection for 16%. We recommend routine implementation of an enhanced surveillance system that includes prompt forwarding and typing of hepatitis A virus RNA isolated from serum, standard use of questionnaires, data sharing, and centralized interpretation of data."
CD011926,0,18945833,0,High prevalence of human Parechovirus (HPeV) genotypes in the Amsterdam region and identification of specific HPeV variants by direct genotyping of stool samples.,"Human parechoviruses (HPeV) are widespread pathogens belonging to the Picornavirus family. Six genotypes, which have predominantly been isolated from children, are known. Data on prevalence of HPeV genotypes are generally based on cell culture, which may underestimate the prevalence of certain HPeV strains that are difficult to grow. We studied 1,824 stool samples from 1,379 children (<5 years old) sent to the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, between 2004 and 2006. Samples were screened using specific human enterovirus (HEV) and HPeV real-time PCRs based on the 5' untranslated region. A high percentage of HPeV infections (16.3%), comparable to the percentage of HEV infections (18.4%), were found by PCR in stool samples. HPeV-positive stool samples were directly genotyped based on the VP1 region for the first time to avoid a culture bias. HPeV1 was found to be the most prevalent type. The majority of the HPeV1 strains clustered separately from the prototype strain, Harris, which has not been reported to circulate lately. However, we could identify three strains as HPeV1 Harris. HPeV3 was identified as the second most predominant type during 2004 and 2006 but was not found in 2005. HPeV4 to -6 were found in smaller numbers. One strain could not be associated with a known HPeV type (VP1 gene nucleotide similarity: 71%), possibly indicating a new genotype. Also, we report the first identification of three HPeV5 strains and one HPeV1 strain with a different motif at the C-terminal end of VP1, where the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif is normally located."

Using standard neuropathological techniques, the main abnormalities were white matter palor and atrophy, pyramidal tract demyelination, moderate perivascular inflammation, numerous calcifications of blood vessels in basal ganglia, white matter and occasional in the cortex, few opportunistic infections including cytomegalovirus ventriculitis, polymorphonuclear microabcessses and aspergillus abscesses; no toxoplasma was detected. An 18-month-old girl presented with an angiocentric lymphoproliferative disorder in central and peripheral nervous system and muscle, with predominance of B cells. In most cases, low levels of HIV replication were detected in brain tissue, as demonstrated by the presence of only few microglial nodules and giant cells, feeble detection of HIV p24 and p17 antigens by immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization of HIV DNA and RNA and polymerase chain reaction, despite severe clinical encephalopathy. Zidovudine did not improve any patient. In children with severe AIDS encephalopathy, HIV might not be directly implicated in the central nervous system lesions: an intermediate factor such as cytokines or another toxic substance secreted by activated macrophages and/or lymphocytes, could induce severe lesions in the central nervous system and minor pathology of the peripheral nervous system and muscles."

The new method, called in vitro antigen (IVAG), measures p24 antigen released into culture supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that are incubated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). No activated donor lymphocytes or interleukin 2 (IL-2) are added to the culture. Using this technique, HIV-1 infection was detected in 15 of 17 HIV-1-infected infants < 2 months of age, including 3 of 7 infants tested at birth, and 15 of 15 HIV-1-infected infants between 2 and 6 months of age. None of 83 determinations of 15 uninfected infants were positive. These results were found to be comparable to results obtained by the traditional cocultivation technique and the polymerase chain reaction.

Among these 40 samples, 31 samples were positive for the hexon gene used in phylogenetic analysis, as determined by PCR. We identified 7 different serotypes. We constructed the phylogenetic trees of HAdV-B7 and HAdV-B3, the 2 most commonly detected serotypes in this study. All detected HAdV-B7 and -B3 Mongolian strains had identical sequences. HAdV-D8, known to be associated with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), was detected from nasopharyngeal and eye swabs.

In anticipation of the national immunization program, this study was undertaken to characterize rotavirus strains circulating among children in Recife, one of the largest cities in the northeast region of Brazil. Group A rotaviruses were detected in 102 (35%) of 290 faecal specimens collected from children under 5 years of age who presented with acute diarrhoea during a 1-year period between May 2004 and April 2005. In addition to the globally common G1P[8] serotype that accounted for 49% of strains, emerging rotavirus serotypes G8P[6] and G9P[8] represented 2% and 29% of strains, respectively. Following cell culture adaptation, RNA-RNA hybridization demonstrated that two Brazilian G8P[6] rotavirus strains shared a high level of genomic RNA homology with Malawian G8P[6] strains, and a Brazilian G9P[8] strain was related most closely to a G9P[8] strain from India.

The aim of this study was to describe and compare the microbiology of NGA from Caesarean and vaginal deliveries using molecular methods, and to evaluate other possible clinical and non-clinical variables that may have determined the presence of the bacteria in the samples. The value of using NGA and molecular methods to investigate potential pathogens associated with the risk of early infection was also evaluated. Bacteria were identified by a combined molecular approach on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene using both clone analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. A total of 43 and 34 different species were identified in the vaginal (n = 121) and Caesarean (n = 119) deliveries, respectively; 26 of the species observed (51 %) were common to both modalities, although usually less prevalent in the Caesarean cases. Multivariate analysis confirmed an association between infection and prolonged rupture of membranes in vaginal deliveries (odds ratio = 5.7, 95 % confidence interval = 1.1-29.0). Various associations between infection and given variables were also shown, including labour, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and time and place of sample collection. The molecular methods allowed identification of a range of bacteria and potential sources not previously observed in NGA, including possible genito-urinary, gastrointestinal and oral pathogens.

CD011926,0,26100374,0,Human bocavirus infection as a cause of severe acute respiratory tract infection in children.,"In 2005 human bocavirus (HBoV) was discovered in respiratory tract samples of children. The role of HBoV as the single causative agent for respiratory tract infections remains unclear. Detection of HBoV in children with respiratory disease is frequently in combination with other viruses or bacteria. We set up an algorithm to study whether HBoV alone can cause severe acute respiratory tract infection (SARI) in children. The algorithm was developed to exclude cases with no other likely cause than HBoV for the need for admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with SARI. We searched for other viruses by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in these cases and studied their HBoV viral loads. To benchmark our algorithm, the same was applied to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive patients. From our total group of 990 patients who tested positive for a respiratory virus by means of RT-PCR, HBoV and RSV were detected in 178 and 366 children admitted to our hospital. Forty-nine HBoV-positive patients and 72 RSV-positive patients were admitted to the PICU. We found seven single HBoV-infected cases with SARI admitted to PICU (7/49, 14%). They had no other detectable virus by NGS. They had much higher HBoV loads than other patients positive for HBoV. We identified 14 RSV-infected SARI patients with a single RSV infection (14/72, 19%). We conclude that our study provides strong support that HBoV can cause SARI in children in the absence of viral and bacterial co-infections."

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysates from 18 HIV-1 infected children and 28 uninfected subjects were assayed for a 142 bp fragment of DNA from the gag region of HIV-1 using the primer pair SK145-431. Detection of amplified DNA was carried out by hybridization with a radiolabeled SK102 probe, or with a tagged SK102 probe permitting colorimetric detection. The radioactive detection procedure demonstrated 100% specificity and correlated with the serological results. The assay was more sensitive than the p24 antigen test, but two false negative results were obtained. One was from a sample taken at 2 weeks, an age at which undetectable provirus levels were reported in almost all HIV-1 infected newborns. The second was probably due to a low copy number of proviral DNA, as positive results were obtained in all other (6) samples from this child. Comparative analysis in a limited number of specimens of radioactive and colorimetric detection following PCR revealed 100% specificity and comparable sensitivity with 4 discordant results. The results show that PCR is the best method for early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in pediatric subjects. The study also demonstrated the value of a colorimetric detection method for PCR products. This colorimetric microwell plate procedure may prove a useful technique in routine diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in children."
CD011926,0,24218468,0,Neonatal death suspected to be from sepsis was found to be kernicterus with G6PD deficiency.,"We cared for a term male infant born to Burmese immigrants. At about 24 hours a total serum bilirubin (TSB) was 9.3 mg/dL, and phototherapy was begun. It was stopped 48 hours later, with a TSB of 10.9 mg/dL, and he was discharged from the hospital with an appointment for a repeat TSB check 48 hours later. A few hours before the appointment he became listless and apneic, and his parents took him to the emergency department of the regional children's hospital, where sepsis was suspected. The TSB was 41 mg/dL. He died 4 hours later, despite intensive care efforts, with opisthotonus and refractory hypotension. Blood drawn before the exchange transfusion had low glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzymatic activity, and sequencing of the G6PD gene revealed the G6PD Mahidol mutation (c.487G>A). Cultures and postmortem examination did not demonstrate an infectious process, but kernicterus was present. Acute kernicterus can mimic septic shock."

CD011926,0,24841252,0,Syphilis-causing strains belong to separate SS14-like or Nichols-like groups as defined by multilocus analysis of 19 Treponema pallidum strains.,"Treponema pallidum strains are closely related at the genome level but cause distinct diseases. Subspecies pallidum (TPA) is the causative agent of syphilis, subspecies pertenue (TPE) causes yaws while subspecies endemicum (TEN) causes bejel (endemic syphilis). Compared to the majority of treponemal genomic regions, several chromosomal loci were found to be more diverse. To assess genetic variability in diverse genomic positions, we have selected (based on published genomic data) and sequenced five variable loci, TP0304, TP0346, TP0488, TP0515 and TP0558, in 19 reference Treponema pallidum strains including all T. pallidum subspecies (TPA, TPE and TEN). Results of this multilocus analysis divided syphilitic isolates into two groups: SS14-like and Nichols-like. The SS14-like group is comprised of SS14, Grady, Mexico A and Philadelphia 1 strains. The Nichols-like group consisted of strains Nichols, Bal 73-1, DAL-1, MN-3, Philadelphia 2, Haiti B and Madras. The TP0558 locus was selected for further studies because it clearly distinguished between the SS14- and Nichols-like groups and because the phylogenetic tree derived from the TP0558 locus showed the same clustering pattern as the tree constructed from whole genome sequences. In addition, TP0558 was shown as the only tested locus that evolved under negative selection within TPA strains. Sequencing of a short fragment (573bp) of the TP0558 locus in a set of 25 clinical isolates from 22 patients collected in the Czech Republic during 2012-2013 revealed that clinical isolates follow the SS14- and Nichols-like distribution."
CD011926,0,24172156,0,Toxin-producing Clostridium difficile strains as long-term gut colonizers in healthy infants.,"Clostridium difficile is a colonizer of the human gut, and toxin-producing strains may cause diarrhea if the infectious burden is heavy. Infants are more frequently colonized than adults, but they rarely develop C. difficile disease. It is not known whether strains of C. difficile differ in the capacity to colonize and persist in the human gut microbiota. Here, we strain typed isolates of C. difficile that had colonized 42 healthy infants followed from birth to ≥12 months of age by using PCR ribotyping of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region. The isolates were also characterized regarding carriage of the toxin genes tcdA, tcdB, and cdtA/B and the capacity to produce toxin B in vitro. Most strains (71%) were toxin producers, and 51% belonged to the 001 or 014 ribotypes, which often cause disease in adults. These ribotypes were significantly more likely than others to persist for ≥6 months in the infant micobiota, and they were isolated from 13/15 children carrying such long-term-colonizing strains. Ribotype 001 strains were often acquired in the first week of life and attained higher population counts than other C. difficile ribotypes in newborn infants' feces. Several toxin-negative ribotypes were identified, two of which (GI and GIII) were long-term colonizers, each found in one infant. Our results suggest that the toxin-producing C. difficile ribotypes 001 and 014 have special fitness in the infantile gut microbiota. Toxin-producing strains colonizing young children for long time periods may represent a reservoir for strains causing disease in adults."

Here, we retrospectively analyzed 12,025 hospitalized children with respiratory infection by using serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods simultaneously. The results showed that 2433 (20.23%) children had MP infection, which mainly occurred in November to April. The presence of sore throat and pharyngitis was peculiar to MP infection. The positive percentage of MP-DNA was higher than that of MP-IgM in children aged <1 (P < 0.0001) and 1-3 years (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the positive rate of P1 gene, the key adhesion gene for MP infection, was higher in children with MP infection than in those with other pathogens (P < 0.0001). Our work provides the clinical information of children MP infection and highlights the superiority of PCR and potential usage of P1 as a diagnosis target for MP infection."
CD011926,0,20203216,0,"Comparison of the performance of direct fluorescent antibody staining, a point-of-care rapid antigen test and virus isolation with that of RT-PCR for the detection of novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus in respiratory specimens.","Although infections with the novel pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus (A/H1N1/2009) appeared to be relatively mild during the first summer of circulation ('off season'), there has been significant morbidity and hospitalization and several fatal cases. Thus, rapid detection of A/H1N1/2009 is crucial for efficient treatment and infection control measures. In contrast to seasonal influenza, where point-of-care (POC) rapid antigen tests and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining ensure rapid detection, diagnosis of A/H1N1/2009 has so far been based on RT-PCR. This study retrospectively compared the performance of the Quidel QuickVue POC test, DFA staining and virus isolation with that of RT-PCR for A/H1N1/2009 detection in 526 respiratory specimens collected during the first wave of the outbreak from May to September 2009. A/H1N1/2009 was detected in 9.1% (48/526) of samples. One hundred and thirty-seven of the A/H1N1/2009 PCR-negative samples were additionally tested using a RealAccurate Respiratory RT-PCR panel, revealing other respiratory viruses (mainly entero/rhino- and adenoviruses) in 42.3% (58/137). All methods analysed detected A/H1N1/2009 with excellent specificity but different sensitivities (POC test: 18.2%; DFA staining: 38.7%; virus isolation: 45.7%). Therefore, the POC test was not suitable for diagnosis, detecting A/H1N1/2009 only if present in high concentrations (corresponding median Ct value=19.0; range=16.5-21.4). DFA staining was also able to detect A/H1N1/2009 in specimens with a lower virus concentration (median Ct value=24.0; range=16.5-29.8). Virus isolation, which was positive after a median time of 7.5 days, was too time-consuming. In summary, DFA staining is superior to POC testing and may be appropriate for patients expected to have a rather high level of virus replication. Nevertheless, in DFA-negative specimens, A/H1N1/2009 should be excluded by RT-PCR."
CD011926,0,7770129,0,"Clinical, serological and PCR evidence of cytomegalovirus infection in the central nervous system in infancy and childhood.","Over a 3-year-period (Dec. 1990-Nov. 1993) 12 children were found PCR-positive for CMV-DNA in CSF and brain biopsies. Three of the patients were immunologically compromised. During the same period CSF samples from 10 shunt-operated children and 143 virological routine CSF samples were PCR CMV negative. Clinical association with positive PCR-CMV reaction was considered likely in 6 patients: two boys developed prolonged fever and meningoencephalitis following neurosurgery, one infant girl had a course compatible with congenital inclusion disease, and three had prolonged fever following transplantation. Clinical association was deemed probable in 3 infant girls: one had neonatal infection, meningitis and intraventricular haemorrhage, one had neonatal encephalitis and failure to thrive, and one with neonatal seizures and encephalitis developed brain atrophy. Clinical association was judged possible in 3 patients: one infant girl with no signs of encephalitis developed brain atrophy, one had an Aicardi Type 1 syndrome and one 2 1/2-year-old boy had an acute encephalitis with insufficient serological support for CMV but was 12 months later PCR positive for CMV. We conclude that CMV may be an overlooked infectious agent of the CNS also in immunocompetent children. PCR aids in rapid diagnosis of CMV infection in the immunocompromised. CMV may occasionally be disclosed with PCR in other conditions as a probably non-relevant observation."

CD011926,0,24339987,0,Streptococcus pneumoniae from Palestinian nasopharyngeal carriers: serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance.,"Infections of Streptococcus pneumoniae in children can be prevented by vaccination; left untreated, they cause high morbidity and fatalities. This study aimed at determining the nasopharyngeal carrier rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of S. pneumoniae in healthy Palestinian children under age two prior to the full introduction of the pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7), which was originally introduced into Palestine in a pilot trial in September, 2010. In a cross sectional study, nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 397 healthy children from different Palestinian districts between the beginning of November 2012 to the end of January 2013. Samples were inoculated into blood agar and suspected colonies were examined by amplifying the pneumococcal-specific autolysin gene using a real-time PCR. Serotypes were identified by a PCR that incorporated different sets of specific primers. Antimicrobial susceptibility was measured by disk diffusion and MIC methods. The resulting carrier rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 55.7% (221/397). The main serotypes were PCV7 serotypes 19F (12.2%), 23F (9.0%), 6B (8.6%) and 14 (4%) and PCV13 serotypes 6A (13.6%) and 19A (4.1%). Notably, serotype 6A, not included in the pilot trial (PCV7) vaccine, was the most prevalent. Resistance to more than two drugs was observed for bacteria from 34.1% of the children (72/211) while 22.3% (47/211) carried bacteria were susceptible to all tested antibiotics. All the isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin. Any or all of these might impinge on the type and efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and antibiotics to be used for prevention and treatment of pneumococcal disease in the country."
CD011926,0,20818947,0,Molecular microbiological methods in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.,"Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. The current gold standard for diagnosis of sepsis, namely blood culture, suffers from low sensitivity and a reporting delay of approximately 48-72 h. Rapid detection of sepsis and institution of antimicrobial therapy may improve patient outcomes. Rapid and sensitive tests that can inform clinicians regarding the institution or optimization of antimicrobial therapy are urgently needed. The ideal diagnostic test should have adequate specificity and negative predictive value to reliably exclude sepsis and avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy. We comprehensively searched for neonatal studies that evaluated molecular methods for diagnosis of sepsis. We identified 19 studies that were assessed with respect to assay methodology and diagnostic characteristics. In addition, we also reviewed newer molecular microbiological assays of relevance that have not been fully evaluated in neonates. Molecular methods offer distinct advantages over blood cultures, including increased sensitivity and rapid diagnosis. However, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness should be established before implementation in clinical practice."
CD011926,0,19839760,0,Detection of Escherichia coli enteropathogens by multiplex polymerase chain reaction from children's diarrheal stools in two Caribbean-Colombian cities.,"Acute diarrheal disease is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing world and Escherichia coli intestinal pathogens are important causative agents. Information on the epidemiology of E. coli intestinal pathogens and their association with diarrheal disease is limited because no diagnostic testing is available in countries with limited resources. To evaluate the prevalence of E. coli intestinal pathogens in a Caribbean-Colombian region, E. coli clinical isolates from children with diarrhea were analyzed by a recently reported two-reaction multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Gomez-Duarte et al., Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis 2009;63:1-9). The phylogenetic group from all E. coli isolates was also typed by a single-reaction multiplex polymerase chain reaction. We found that among 139 E. coli strains analyzed, 20 (14.4%) corresponded to E. coli diarrheagenic pathotypes. Enterotoxigenic, shiga-toxin-producing, enteroaggregative, diffuse adherent, and enteropathogenic E. coli pathotypes were detected, and most of them belonged to the phylogenetic groups A and B1, known to be associated with intestinal pathogens. This is the first report on the molecular characterization of E. coli diarrheogenic isolates in Colombia and the first report on the potential role of E. coli in childhood diarrhea in this geographic area."

CD011926,0,23918545,0,Frequency of enterovirus detection in blood samples of neonates admitted to hospital with sepsis-like illness in Kuwait.,"This study investigated the role of enteroviruses in sepsis-like illness among neonates in Kuwait. Serum samples from 139 consecutive neonates presenting with sepsis-like illness during a three and a half-year-period whose blood cultures were negative for bacterial pathogens were tested. Enterovirus RNA was detected by single-step reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Specific genotypes were identified by direct DNA sequencing of enteroviral genome. Serotype-specific antibodies in serum samples from some selected patients were detected by virus neutralization test using coxsackievirus B types (CBVs). All 139 neonates presented with sepsis-like illness and blood samples were uniformly negative for aerobic/anaerobic bacterial cultures. Fifty-six (40%) neonates had further complications of sepsis including carditis (n = 34) and multi-organ involvement (n = 22). Enterovirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in 34 of 139 (24%) serum samples which is among the highest frequency reported so far in non-epidemic settings. Genotyping identified CBVs as most common enteroviruses, causing 19 of 34 (56%) enteroviral sepsis episodes in neonates. Of 34 carditis cases, 18 were positive for CBVs by serotyping including all 10 enterovirus RNA-positive samples. Only one fatality was observed due to liver failure in a neonate with hepatitis. Our data showed that enteroviruses are responsible for 24% of neonatal sepsis cases due to non-bacterial causes in Kuwait. The data indicate that enteroviruses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sepsis-like illness among neonates, particularly those with negative blood cultures for bacterial pathogens."

An unusually wide spectrum of etiologic agents that included 36 species of Aspergillus is discussed in the context of recent taxonomic and clinical reports. Invasive aspergillosis (IA), onychomycosis, and otitis externa were the predominant clinical entities. Five cases due to species newly proven as etiologic agents of human mycoses, as well as cases with unique clinical manifestations caused by unusual agents are discussed in more detail. Three species (i.e., A. insulicola, A. westerdijkiae and A. tritici) were identified as the confirmed etiologic agents of non-dermatophytic onychomycosis. Emericella rugulosa was recovered from a premature newborn with a fatal necrotising disseminated infection and is reported for only the second time as the cause of IA. Furthermore, we document the first infection due to A. calidoustus in a patient with chronic granulomatous disease. The infection manifested as a latent brain aspergilloma with an unusual clinical-laboratory finding. In addition to the well-known agents of human mycosis, several rarely isolated or poorly documented species were identified. An undescribed cryptic species related to A. versicolor was found to be common among isolates linked to proven and probable onychomycosis. An isolate representing A. fresenii, or an unnamed sister species, were causal agents of otomycosis. Three well defined, and tentative new species belonging to section Cervini, Candidi and Aspergillus (Eurotium spp.), were associated with cases of probable onychomycosis."
CD011926,0,20336732,0,Viral etiology of respiratory infections in children under 5 years old living in tropical rural areas of Senegal: The EVIRA project.,"Acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child morbidity, especially in developing countries. Viruses are recognized as the predominant causative agents of acute respiratory infections. In Senegal, few data concerning the causes of respiratory infections are available, and those known relate mainly to classical influenza infections. Clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections was carried out in a rural community in children less than 5 years old. A standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient. These samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR or by viral culture. A total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included, and 48 (58.5%) were found to be positive, with a total of 55 viral detections; several samples were positive for two (n = 5) or 3 (n = 1) viruses. Ten different viruses were identified: influenza viruses A, B, and C (n = 25), human respiratory syncytial virus type A (n = 13), rhinoviruses (n = 8), human coronaviruses type 229E and NL63 (n = 6), parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 (n = 2), and bocavirus (n = 1). These results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in Senegal. The establishment of sentinel surveillance sites could help estimate the burden of acute respiratory infection in the pediatric population and should help prepare the health care systems to identify and respond to new viral respiratory emergencies."

CD011926,0,8390647,0,Absence of varicella zoster DNA in varicella embryopathy tissue utilizing the polymerase chain reaction.,"We have previously examined a case of varicella embryopathy (VE) occurring in a 41-week gestational age infant, showing some of the most severe lesions reported to be associated with the syndrome to date. A previous survey of the postmortem tissue with two anti-varicella zoster antibodies was negative. It was hypothesized that if varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was associated with VE, a latent viral infection might be expected, similar to that occurring in adults infected with VZV. Subsequently, an attempt was made to identify DNA encoding three separate and specific VZV genes using the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction from formalin-fixed tissues of the central nervous system including cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem, in addition to frozen tissue of liver, adrenal, and thymus. Although amplifications utilizing primers for a normal human DNA sequence (ME491) demonstrated the ability of the samples to serve as a target for the PCR, none of the samples contained amplifiable VZV DNA. Substitution of biotin 11-dUTP in the PCR and subsequent detection of the biotinylated amplimers resulted in a large increase of the sensitivity of the PCR amplimer detection, but still failed to detect the presence of VZV DNA in the samples. The most likely explanation for these findings suggests a complete destruction of fetal tissue tropic for VZV with a subsequent inability for a latent VZV infection to be established."

The rapid and accurate identification of bacterial pathogens associated with gastroenteritis can aid acute patient management decisions, including the use of antibiotic therapy and infection control. This study compared the ProGastro SSCS multiplex real-time PCR assay (Gen-Probe Prodesse, San Diego, CA) to culture for the identification of Campylobacter spp. (Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli), Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. and to broth enrichment followed by an FDA-cleared enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the identification of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) isolates in stool specimens. Stool samples submitted in preservatives for routine culture and EIA were prospectively enrolled and tested at four clinical centers. Discrepancies between the ProGastro SSCS assay and culture or EIA were resolved using bidirectional sequencing. The overall prevalence of the pathogens as detected by culture was 5.6% (1.8% Campylobacter, 1.8% Salmonella, 1.3% Shigella, and 0.8% STEC). When results based on the ProGastro SSCS assay and bidirectional sequencing were applied, the overall prevalence increased to 8.3% (2.3% Campylobacter, 2.6% Salmonella, 1.8% Shigella, and 1.6% STEC). Following resolution of the discrepant results, the sensitivity of the ProGastro SSCS assay was 100% for all pathogens, and the specificities ranged from 99.4% to 100%. The sensitivity of culture compared to sequence-confirmed ProGastro SSCS results ranged from 52.9% to 76.9%, with the specificities ranging from 99.9% to 100%. Overall, these results suggest that the ProGastro SSCS assay is highly sensitive and specific in a clinical setting."

Cephalosporin-resistant isolates were examined for the presence of genes encoding beta-lactamases by PCR and sequencing. Ten different PFGE types were observed. One type (30 isolates) was recovered in all three countries; three types were found only in Bulgaria, two only in Denmark, two only in Thailand, and two both in Denmark and Thailand. Ten isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested, whereas 41 were resistant to three or more antimicrobials. Most resistance was observed among the isolates from Bulgaria. Of the 25 isolates from Bulgaria, 20 displayed resistance to ampicillin and the cephalosporins ceftiofur and cephalothin. All 20 isolates tested negative for bla (CMY-1), bla (CMY-2), and bla (ACC), but positive for bla (SHV), of which five were sequenced to bla (SHV-2). Plasmid profiling and hybridization revealed that the bla (SHV) gene was located on plasmids of approximately 70 kb. Five plasmid profiles were found among these 20 isolates. The plasmid profiling confirmed the PFGE-type and was able to further subdivide the strains. Seventeen of these 20 isolates contained also bla (TEM), of which nine representatives were sequenced to bla (TEM-1B), or bla (TEM-1H). One isolate contained bla (CTX-M-15), bla (SHV-2), and bla (TEM-1H), with the bla (CTX-M-15), and bla (TEM-1H) genes located on a 63-kb transferable plasmid.

In these, we assessed the role of Plasmodium falciparum pfmdr1 and pfcrt polymorphisms in amodiaquine resistance. Except for pfmdr1 1246Y (prevalence, 5%), no P. falciparum allele predicted treatment outcome. Pfcrt 76T as well as pfmdr1 86Y, 86Y-184F-1246D, and 86Y-184Y-1246Y were positively selected in treatment failures, and pfmdr1 86N-184F-1246D negatively. The weak association of pfmdr1/pfcrt alleles with amodiaquine treatment outcome suggests further factors to be involved in the unsatisfactory low efficacy of the drug and limits the usefulness of these markers in this area."

CD011926,0,16254004,0,Universal DNA primers amplify bacterial DNA from human fetal membranes and link Fusobacterium nucleatum with prolonged preterm membrane rupture.,"A large number of bacterial species have been identified in fetal membranes after preterm labour (PTL) associated with intrauterine infection by microbiological culture. In this study, we have investigated a molecular and bioinformatic approach to organism identification which surmounts the need for specific and diverse microbiological culture conditions required by conventional methods. Samples of fetal membranes were taken from 37 preterm infants, and 6 normal term controls delivered by caesarean section, in which bacteria had been detected by in situ hybridization of 16S ribosomal RNA using a generic probe. Degenerate primers were designed to amplify bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA by PCR and used to amplify bacterial DNA from human fetal membranes. Amplicons were cloned, sequenced and bacteria were identified bioinformatically by comparison of sequences with known bacterial DNA genomes. In situ hybridization using an organism specific probe was then used to confirm the presence of the commonest identified organism in tissue samples. Bacterial DNA amplified from 15/43 samples, all from preterm deliveries, and the bioinformatic approach identified organisms in all cases. Multiple bacteria were identified including Mycoplasma hominis, Pasturella multocida, Pseudomonas PH1, Escherichia coli and Prevotella bivia. The commonest organism Fusobacterium nucleatum was found in 9/15 (60%) of samples. Ten of the 12 samples obtained after prolonged membrane rupture were positive for bacterial DNA, and 7 of these (70%) contained DNA from F. nucleatum. Bacteria from fetal membranes may be identified by molecular and bioinformatic methods. Further work is warranted to investigate the apparent linkage between F. nucleatum, fetal membrane rupture and preterm delivery."

We cared for four infected preterm infants and ordered prophylactic treatment with oseltamivir in 13 additional contact preterm infants. A number of lessons can be drawn from this experience. The first two cases in twins were revealed by an increase in the number of apnea and one infant required mechanical ventilation. Cough was the major symptom in the two other infected infants. No digestive intolerance was observed among the 17 preterm infants during oseltamivir treatment. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quickly determined whether an infant was infected, making it helpful in deciding on initial containment. PCR remained positive, whereas culture became negative. Therefore, culture appeared to be more relevant in deciding on the end of containment. Follow-up of the four infected infants showed their ability to develop immunity against H1N1v."

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RSV by direct immunofluorescence antibody (DFA), cell culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in children with lower respiratory tract infection. Nasotracheal aspirate specimens collected from 80 hospitalized patients aged between 0-24 months and clinically diagnosed as lower respiratory tract infection, during November 2005-May 2006 period, were included to the study. RSV antigen was investigated in clinical specimens by DFA method (Monofluo Bio-Rad, France). Hep-2 culture was used for isolation of RSV. RSV-RNA was investigated by real-time PCR (Fluorion lontek, Turkey) in clinical specimens. RSV was found positive in 26 (32.5%) of 80 samples by DFA and in 17 (21.3%) samples by cell culture. Six specimens were not studied by PCR as sample amounts were not sufficient. Of the 74 samples tested, 20 (27%) were found to be positive by real-time PCR. Fifty-four of the samples were negative by 3 of the methods, while 12 were positive by all of them. DFA and PCR positive 8 samples yielded negative result in cell culture. Five of the 6 samples not investigated by PCR, were positive both in DFA and cell culture while 1 sample was positive only by DFA. Considering cell culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were found as 100%, 85.7%, 65.4% and 100%, respectively, for DFA and 100%, 94.7%, 85% and 100%, respectively, for PCR. As a conclusion for the accurate diagnosis of RSV infections the clinical samples should be collected in the early phase of the disease and inoculated to the cell cultures immediately for viral isolation. If cell culture or PCR facilities are not available for routine diagnosis, DFA method can be used for rapid and cost effective diagnosis of RSV infections."

CD011926,0,11991880,0,Association of rhinovirus infection with increased disease severity in acute bronchiolitis.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major pathogen responsible for acute bronchiolitis in infancy. However, evaluation of the relative importance of rhinovirus or multiple viral infections has been hampered by the lack of sensitive diagnostic methodologies. Therefore, in this study we used the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for 11 respiratory pathogens to assess the etiology in infants with acute bronchiolitis and correlate it with clinical characteristics of the disease. Viruses were detected in 73.7% of patients. RSV was identified in 72.4% of virologically confirmed cases, rhinovirus in 29%, whereas multiple infections represented 19.5% of cases, most of which (69%) were combinations of rhinovirus with RSV. In a logistic regression model controlling for age, sex, birth weight, presence of fever, and day of disease on admission, the presence of rhinovirus was found to increase by approximately five-fold, the risk for severe disease. Multiple pathogens had a similar trend in the univariate analysis, which was eliminated in the multivariate model. Multiple virus cases were admitted to the hospital later in the course of their disease than unique pathogen cases, suggesting successive infections. In conclusion, rhinovirus is second only to RSV as a causative agent of bronchiolitis and is associated with more severe disease. The presence of more than one pathogen may influence the natural history of acute bronchiolitis."

CD011926,0,7494848,0,[Varicella in pregnancy].,"Chickenpox rarely occurs during pregnancy but affected patients risk not only varicella pneumonia but also fetal contamination with potentially malformative effects or severe neonatal infection depending on whether the infection occurs early or late during pregnancy. More than 15% of the affected women have detectable lesions on the chest X-ray. Respiratory distress is the main risk with mortality reaching nearly 20%. Fetal contamination occurs via transplacental transmission. Fetal malformations are observed in less than 5% of the cases when fetal infection occurs early (before the end of the fifth month) but are generally quite severe. The mechanism is apparently fetal zona a few weeks after initial infection. Antenatal diagnosis is generally obtained on the basis of sonographic findings, and identification of viral genome using polymerase chain reaction on cordocentesis or amniotic fluid biopsy samples. Screening attempts to identify fetal anomalies and evaluate fetal prognosis. Induced abortion should be discussed in cases where both fetal malformation and fetal infection are confirmed. After five months, the risk of malformation appears to be much lower. It is known however that fetal varicella can be observed if the maternal infection occurs just before delivery. The most severe forms are seen when the maternal eruption occurs during the 4 days prior to delivery. Neonatal mortality in these cases reaches 20%. Unlike varicella, there is apparently little or no risk either for the mother or for the child in case of zona during pregnancy."
CD011926,0,20236124,0,De novo duplication of MECP2 in a girl with mental retardation and no obvious dysmorphic features.,"Loss-of-function mutations of MECP2 are responsible for Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder affecting mainly girls. The availability of MECP2 testing has led to the identification of such mutations in girls with atypical RTT features and the recognition of milder forms. Furthermore, duplication of the entire gene has recently been described in boys with mental retardation and recurrent infections. We describe a girl with a heterozygous de novo MECP2 duplication. The patient, at the age of 19, has mental retardation with no autistic features. She is friendly but gets frequently anxious. She has neither dysmorphic features nor malformations. Her motor development was delayed with walking at 20 months. Speech is fluid with good pronunciation but is simple and repetitive. Diagnosis was made after single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis of MECP2. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis showed a duplication of 29 kb including MECP2 and part of IRAK1. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has revealed that the duplicated region is inserted near the telomere of the short arm of chromosome 10. X-chromosome inactivation in leukocyte DNA was not skewed. We conclude that it is likely that this MECP2 duplication is responsible for the mental retardation in this patient. This case broadens the phenotypic spectrum of MECP2 abnormalities with consequent implication in diagnosis and genetic counselling of girls with non-syndromic mental retardation."

CD011926,0,14735402,0,Quantitation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA loads in cervicovaginal secretions in pregnant women and relationship between viral loads in the genital tract and blood.,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the quantitation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA (HIV-1 RNA) in the genital tract of HIV-1-infected pregnant women and to evaluate a possible correlation with the viral load in blood plasma (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). A total of 38 each of cervical, vaginal, and blood samples from 38 women were obtained during the third trimester of pregnancy for quantitation of the HIV-1 RNA load. Viral loads were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The HIV-1 RNA viral load was detectable in 29 of the 38 (76.3%) blood samples, in 6 of the 38 (15.7%) cervical secretion samples, and in 8 of the 38 (21%) vaginal secretion samples. Overall, the correlation between the HIV-1 RNA viral load in the blood plasma and in cervical secretion samples was 0.51 ( P<0.001). However, the correlation disappeared ( r=0.27) when three patients with high blood plasma viral loads were eliminated from the statistical study. The viral load in the vaginal secretions did not correlate with that in the blood samples ( r=0.26). There were two cases in which HIV-1 RNA was undetectable in the blood and cervix but was detectable in vaginal secretions: one woman had 220 copies/ml and the other 68 copies/ml. These results suggest that pregnant women with undetectable viral loads in blood plasma are still at risk of transmitting the virus vertically during vaginal delivery. Because of this, antiretroviral prophylaxis during vaginal delivery must be administered to HIV-1-infected women and their newborns, regardless of the mother's viral load in plasma. In conclusion, quantification of cervicovaginal levels of HIV-1 may represent a useful tool for assessing the individual risk associated with a vaginal delivery and for guiding decisions about whether a scheduled caesarean should be recommended."

Both infants were treated for symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection affecting the central nervous system. Ganciclovir was given intravenously in two phases, for a total of 4 and 6 weeks, in a daily dose of 5-10 mg/kg. Diagnosis of infection and follow-up of treatment efficacy was based on the quantitative assessment by PCR assay of viral nucleic acid in blood and urine samples. Treatment resulted in substantial reduction of viral copy numbers in both infants' blood and urine samples. Improvement in the biochemical markers of disease activity was accompanied with spectacular improvement of clinical symptoms in the infant with severe liver involvement. Following the treatment viral loads increased in both infant but clinical symptoms did not reoccur. In one patient a considerable improvement of hearing loss was observed. The authors' first results indicate that ganciclovir treatment of neonatal cytomegalovirus infection represents a promising approach in preventing the progression of the disease and in ameliorating the consequences."

A total of 89 clinical isolates of M. abscessus complex from 71 patients of 2 tertiary care hospitals in South Korea were included. Forty-two isolates were identified as M. abscessus, and 29, as Mycobacterium massiliense through sequencing of 8 housekeeping genes and rpoB. The MLST scheme identified 26 different sequence types(STs) and 13 different clonal complexes (CCs) in M. abscessus and 12 different STs and 6 different CCs in M. massiliense. The MLST data showed high concordance with the XbaI-macrorestriction patterns of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in the duplicated isolates. Our MLST schemes could identify different strains of M. abscessus and M. massiliense, and the schemes also showed a reliable reproducibility. Therefore, our MLST schemes may be useful in studying the epidemiology of M. abscessus and M. massiliense infections."

Forty-five children born of mothers with antibodies to HIV type 1 were studied; P24 antigen was measured in plasma, and HIV-1 proviral DNA was sought in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after amplification by PCR. In 26 cases, blood specimens were cultured for HIV; in all but two instances cultures were established at the same time that the PCR test was performed. Primer pairs in three regions of the proviral genome were used for the PCR test. There was good agreement between the results obtained from PCR tests and from cultures; of 24 children in whom both tests were done at the same time, 10 had positive results on both the culture and the PCR test, 1 had positive results on the PCR test but negative culture results, and 13 had negative results on both tests (concordance 96%). Measurement of p24 antigen in plasma was, in contrast, an insensitive marker of infection: 6 of 12 infants with positive cultures had positive p24 test results, and 8 of 18 infants had positive PCR test results. Sixteen children with subsequent seronegativity for HIV-1 had negative PCR results. This study provides further evidence that the PCR test is a valid alternative to viral culture for the diagnosis of pediatric HIV infection."

CD011926,0,25923117,0,Single Genome Analysis for the Detection of Linked Multiclass Drug Resistance Mutations in HIV-1-Infected Children After Failure of Protease Inhibitor-Based First-Line Therapy.,"The WHO recommends protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) for vertically infected children after failed nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis. Emergence of PI resistance on the backdrop of preexisting non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance could compromise long-term treatment options in such children. We characterized multiclass drug resistance using single genome sequencing (SGS) in children with viremia while receiving PI-based ART. We applied SGS of HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase to longitudinal samples from a cohort of the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy trial with viral loads >1000 copies per milliliter after 40 weeks of early ART. Bulk sequencing revealed NVP-selected resistance in 50% of these children, whereas SGS revealed NVP-selected resistance in 70%. Two children had baseline NRTI and PI mutations, suggesting previous maternal ART. Linked multiclass drug resistance after PI-based ART was detected by SGS in 2 of 10 children. In one child, the majority species contained M184V in reverse transcriptase linked to L10F, M46I/L, I54V, and V82A in PR and a triple-class drug-resistant variant with these mutations linked to the NNRTI mutation V108I. In the second child, the majority species contained M184V and V82A linked within viral genomes. We conclude that when PI-based ART is initiated soon after birth after single dose-NVP prophylaxis, PI and NRTI resistance can occur in the majority species as expected and also be selected on the same genomes as preexisting NNRTI-resistant mutations. These observations highlight a future therapeutic challenge for vertically infected children where antiretroviral drug classes are limited."

In this study, we report for the first time an outbreak of a novel Enterobacter sp. harbouring bla(CTX-M-15) in a neonatal unit in Tanzania. Seventeen Gram-negative enteric isolates from neonatal blood cultures were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by disc diffusion testing, and the presence of the bla(CTX-M-15) gene was established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Identification by biochemical profiling was followed by nucleotide sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), rpoB and hsp60 alleles. Environmental sampling was done and control measures were established. Isolates were initially misidentified based on their fermentation characteristics and agglutination as Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems, and were found to harbour bla(CTX-M-15) on a 291-kb narrow-range plasmid. PFGE analysis indicated the clonal outbreak of a single strain, infecting 17 neonates with a case fatality rate of 35%. The same strain was isolated from a milk bucket. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA, rpoB and hsp60 sequences permitted no definitive identification, clustering the strains in the Enterobacter cloacae complex with similarities of 92-98.8%. The data describe an outbreak of a novel bla(CTX-M-15)-positive, multiresistant Enterobacter strain in an African neonatal unit that can easily be misidentified taxonomically.

CD011926,0,19836680,0,[Chikungunya virus infections in children].,"Chikungunya fever is an arbovirosis caused by an alphavirus (CHIKV) belonging to the Togaviridae family. Its main vectors are Aedes mosquitoes. In its classic form, Chikungunya consists in a flu-like illness that can be very disabling, especially by incapacitating arthralgia. In children, the arthropathy is well known to be better tolerated than in adulthood but severe manifestations and complications can occur owing to neurologic, cardiac, hematologic or cutaneous dysfunctions, all carrying a fatality risk in the absence of appropriate intensive care. Out of these, the most singular is a severe encephalopathy, even in some cases genuine encephalitis. More rare, but quite specific of small infants, skin blisters have been reported, sometimes complicated by extensive detachments. Mother-to-child infections were demonstrated on La Réunion island with a fifty-percent probability of vertical transmission when the mother was highly viremic around the term of pregnancy. The diagnosis can be made by detecting CHIKV RNA using RT-PCR or specific IgM antibodies using MAC-Elisa serology. Chikungunya is a notifiable disease. The epidemic that emerged in Indian Ocean islands during 2005-2006, its progressive extension to Asia and even to Italy in July 2007, highlighted a very important capacity of CHIKV to cause huge outbreaks wherever Aedes sp. can proliferate. In France, Aedes albopictus is definitively endemic in the departments of Alpes-Maritimes since 2004, Corsica since 2005, and Var since 2007. Therefore, the risk of introduction of CHIKV from an epidemic area to Europe and especially in France is real."

CD011926,0,9889216,0,Rapid method for screening dried blood samples on filter paper for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 DNA.,"PCR is a highly sensitive method for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nucleic acids in blood mononuclear cells and plasma. However, blood separation techniques require extensive laboratory support systems and are difficult when a limited volume of blood is available, which is often the case for infants. The use of blood samples stored on filter paper has many advantages for the detection of perinatal HIV-1 infection, but current methods require extraction and purification of target DNA prior to PCR amplification. We report a highly sensitive and rapid method for the extraction and detection of HIV-1 DNA in infant blood samples stored on filter papers. Because this rapid protocol does not involve steps for the removal of potential inhibitors of the PCR, the highest sensitivity is achieved by testing the filter paper lysate in quadruplicate. Assays for HIV-1 DNA were done by using nested PCR techniques that amplify HIV-1 gag DNA from blood spot samples on filter paper and from corresponding viably frozen mononuclear cells separated from venous blood samples obtained from 111 infants born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers. PCR results with blood from filter papers showed 100% specificity (95% confidence internal [CI] 93.1 to 100%) and 96% (95% CI, 88.65 to 98.9%) and 88% (95% CI, 79.2 to 94.5%) sensitivity (for quadruplicate and duplicate tests, respectively) compared to PCR results with blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, this method could detect HIV-1 sequences of multiple subtypes."
CD011926,0,23313830,0,Evolutionary time-scale of primate bocaviruses.,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) is associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans, occurring mostly in young children and elderly people. Four bocavirus genotypes (HBoV1-HBoV4) have been found so far. Since there were no data on the contribution of HBoV to gastroenteritis in Russia, 1781 fecal samples collected from infants hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in Novosibirsk, Russia during one year were tested for the presence of nucleic acids from HBoV and three major gastrointestinal viruses (rotavirus A, norovirus II, and astrovirus). HBoV was detected only in 1.9% of the samples: HBoV1 was detected in 0.6% and HBoV2, in 1.3%. Complete genome sequencing of three Novosibirsk isolates was performed. An evolutionary analysis of these sequences and the available sequences of human and great apes bocaviruses demonstrated that the current HBoV genotypes diverged comparatively recently, about 60-300years ago. The independent evolution of bocaviruses from chimpanzees and gorillas commenced at the same time period. This suggests that these isolates of great apes bocaviruses belong to separate genotypes within the species of human bocavirus, which is actually the primate bocavirus. The rate of mutation accumulation in the genome of primate bocaviruses has been estimated as approximately 9×10(-4)substitutions/site/year. It has been demonstrated that HBoV1 diverged from the ancestor common with chimpanzee bocavirus approximately 60-80years ago, while HBoV4 separated from great apes bocaviruses about 200-300years ago. The hypothesis postulating independent evolution of HBoV1 and HBoV4 genotypes from primate bocaviruses has been proposed."

Of these 221 patients, 29 (13%) had isolates with intermediate-level resistance to penicillin. Infection with these penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates was significantly associated with age of <2 years (P<.0019), previous antibiotic use (P<.0006), and coresistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (P<.0000). Serotype 14 was the most prevalent serotype (55.2%) of penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates. Strain typing by repetitive element BOX polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that penicillin-nonsusceptible serotype 14 isolates had closely related BOX PCR patterns, whereas penicillin-susceptible serotype 14 isolates each had distinct, unrelated patterns. Penicillin-nonsusceptible serotype 14 isolates from Salvador and other Brazilian cities had similar BOX PCR patterns. These observations indicate that in Brazil a large proportion of cases of penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococcal meningitis appear to be caused by a closely related group of serotype 14 strains that may have disseminated to widely separate geographic areas."

The gut microbiota has an influence in the morphological, immunological and nutritional functions of the digestive tract and may be involved in many diseases. This article proposes the rationale behind conducting in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) of the human microbiota, as well as outlining the conceptual and technical difficulties involved in IVD testing. The molecular methods that can be used according to whether the IVD tools are employed to study one individual constituent species or to determine the microbiota as a whole will also be described. In the latter case, these technologies include high-throughput sequencing for metagenomics and DNA microarrays, which can now be efficiently used to study gut ecology and are believed to represent the future of standardized diagnostics."

RSV infection has rarely been reported in adults in Japan. Nasal samples from 77 patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and negative for influenza in a rapid antigen detection kit were also tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify RSV. A clinical trial was also conducted using a new antigen detection test kit for RSV based on immunochromatography. RSV was detected by nested RT-PCR in samples from nasal swabs of 10 patients--3 children and 5 adults--and nasal aspiration samples in 2 children. The frequency of RSV detection by nested RT-PCR in ILI patients with a negative response for influenza virus using the rapid detection kit was 27.3% (3/11) for children aged 0 to 1 year and 33.3% (2/6) for children aged 2-3 years. The frequency was 10% (1/10) for adults aged 30-39 years, 25% (1/4) for those aged 70-79 years, and 60% (3/5) for those aged 80-89 years. By month, the frequency was 25% (2/8) for December, 27.3% (6/22) for January, and 4.4% (2/45) for February. The main clinical symptoms of the 10 patients with RSV were: peak body temperature during the clinical course of 37.2-39.7 degrees C, cough, and rhinorrhea in 9. Stridor was observed in all five children, but not in the five adults. Clinical examination showed CRP to be 0.2-3.4 (mean 1.3) mg/dL and WBC to be 3070-8000 (mean 5584) /microL for nine patients. Lymphocytopenia was observed in the four adults from whom WBC fraction data was obtained. Chest X-ray was within normal limits. RSV was detected by the new rapid antigen detection kit in 9 of the 10 patients in whom RSV was detected by PCR, but not in any of the 67 patients in whom RSV was not detected. The diagnostic accuracy of the new antigen detection kit for RSV was thus excellent at 98.7% compared to PCR. RSV was detected from nasal swab specimens of a substantial number of elderly Japanese by PCR or the antigen detection kit."

In Colombia, there is no obligatory Toxoplasma screening for pregnant women and both the reporting and follow-up of congenital toxoplasmosis cases is limited, thereby is a public health problem that have no been addressed by health authorities. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of congenital toxoplasmosis in a public hospital from Armenia, Colombia. A total of 200 serum samples of cord blood were collected. We applied a western blot assay (ID Blot DPC Diagnostics, US) for Toxoplasma IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies that was validated in a cohort of children with confirmed presence or absence of congenital infection. The sensitivity of western blot assay was 91 per cent and the specificity was 100 per cent. In the cord blood samples, we found one infected child that died at day 4 of life and his infection was confirmed by PCR of the B1 specific Toxoplasma gene on brain biopsy. This results show a high prevalence (0.5 per cent, IC95 per cent 0.2-0.8) of Toxoplasma infection in Colombian newborns. Thus, we recommend additional studies to determine the cost-effectiveness of a newborn screening program for congenital toxoplasmosis in other settings in Colombia."

Stool antigen tests are non-invasive and are convenient to identify H. pylori infection, particularly in children. We evaluated the stool antigen test, which uses a mAb for native catalase of H. pylori developed in Japan. A total of 151 stool samples were collected from participants (52 children and 99 adults) of the Sasayama Cohort Study and stored between -30 and -80 °C. The stool antigen test used was Testmate pylori antigen (TPAg), and was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative real-time PCR test and compared the PCR results with those of the TPAg test. When compared with the results in real-time PCR, the sensitivity of TPAg was 89.5 % overall, 82.7 % for children and 92.4 % for adults, and the specificity was 100 %. The accuracy was 93.4 % overall, 90.4 % for children and 94.9 % for adults, and there was no significant difference in the accuracy of TPAg between children and adults. Five of 28 children (18 %) and five of 38 adults (13 %) were PCR positive with negative TPAg results. Four of five children with positive PCR and negative TPAg results were given a (13)C-urea breath test and all four children tested negative. No significant correlation was observed between the TPAg results and DNA numbers of H. pylori in faeces among children or adults. A stool antigen test (TPAg) using a mAb for native catalase is useful for diagnosis of H. pylori in children and adults. Additionally, this test has particularly high specificity."

Isolates were identified by serogrouping or as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) adhesin factor (EAF) E. coli, or Shiga-like-toxin (SLT)-producing E. coli by DNA hybridization. EPEC strains of known serogroups were isolated from 10%, ETEC strains were isolated from 6%, EAF E. coli strains were isolated from 4%, EIEC strains were isolated from less than 1%, and SLT-producing E. coli strains were isolated from none of 393 children with diarrhea. Among 278 children whose ages were recorded, the highest rate of isolation of EAF E. coli was 11% (9 of 85) from children less than 6 months old. ETEC was isolated from 5% (4 of 85) of children less than 6 months old, from 10% (12 of 118) of children 6 to 23 months old, and from 1% (1 of 75) of children greater than 23 months old. EPEC strains of known serogroups were isolated from 18% (15 of 85) of children less than 6 months old, from 11% (13 of 118) of children 6 to 23 months old, and from 9% (7 of 75) of children greater than 23 months old. E. coli strains that hybridized with the EIEC probe were isolated from three children who were 20, 36, and 48 months old. Examining E. coli for hybridization with DNA probes for virulence determinants is a practical way of conducting nationwide surveillance of diarrhea-causing E. coli. Since only 33% (13 of 39) of EPEC serogroups hybridized with the EAF probe and none hybridized with the SLT probes, identification of EPEC by serogroups analysis, followed by serotyping, should continue to be used in the identification of EPEC."

Specific diagnostic tests, especially RT-PCR, were not available throughout the country. To assist early clinical diagnosis and treatment, this study compared the clinical features and treatment outcomes of children presenting with influenza-like illness (ILIs). These included confirmed cases of A(H1N1)pdm2009, as well as seasonal influenza and cases for which no cause could be specified. The medical records of patients aged less than 15 years with ILIs, who had RT-PCR performed for influenza virus between May 2009 and December 2011 at Srinagarind Hospital, were reviewed. Clinical features, chest radiographs and treatment outcomes were compared between those positive for A(H1N1)pdm2009, and those with seasonal influenza and/or the unspecified causes group. In 179 complete medical records, 27.4% were positive for A(H1N1)pdm2009, 13.4% for seasonal influenza and the cause of illness in the remainder was unspecified. Both A(H1N1)pdm2009 and seasonal influenza viruses infected older children more than did the unspecified group (group median ages 96,48 and 24 months, respectively). Sore throat, headache and myalgia were significantly more frequent in the A(H1N1)pdm2009 group than in the other two groups (p < 0.001). Half of all children had pneumonia but there were no significant differences among groups. There was no mortality in this study. In conclusion, sore throat, headache and myalgia were the significant clinical features suggestive of A(H1N1)pdm2009 infection in children and might be helpful indicators prompting early administration of specific treatments in the settings where definitive laboratory tests are not available."
CD011926,0,8848704,0,[Monitoring of a whooping cough epidemic 1994/95 in Switzerland using the sentinel notification system. Sentinella Registry].,"Since June 1991 pertussis cases have been reported in the Swiss Sentinel Network (Sentinella). A total of 150-200 general practitioners, physicians specialized in internal medicine, and pediatricians participate in this system on a voluntary basis. Of the three specialties involved, this non-randomized sample represents 3.0%-3.5% of all physicians registered in Switzerland. The objective of this surveillance system is to monitor clinical pertussis over time. The case definition included all patients with a cough illness lasting at least 14 days with one of the following: paroxysms of cough, inspiratory ""whoop"", post-tussive vomiting (sporadic cases), or an epidemiological link to a pertussis case (epidemic cases). A laboratory diagnosis based on the polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR) was available for 82.7% of cases reported in 1994 and 1995. Of these, 27.7% had a positive PCR result. Reports of epidemic pertussis tested for Bordetella pertussis by PCR were confirmed by the laboratory in 46.5% of cases. The laboratory confirmation rate was more than twice as high among epidemic cases than among sporadic cases (20.7%). The crude incidence rate of whooping cough was 70 cases per 100,000 population per year in 1992 and 1993. Compared to previous years, pertussis incidence was significantly higher in 1994 and 1995 (370 cases per 100,000 population and 280 cases per 100,000 population respectively). The increase in reports was especially marked between July and October 1994 and whooping cough became epidemic in the third trimester of 1994 and at the beginning of 1995. In these 2 years, Switzerland experienced an estimated 40,000 clinical pertussis cases. Based on the proportion of PCR-positive pertussis cases in the sentinel sample, 12,500 of these would have been laboratory-confirmed. Most cases were observed in infants and in children up to 6 years of age. Assuming a vaccination coverage of 90%, the global efficacy of vaccination (3 or more doses versus less than 3) for 1994 and 1995 among children aged 12 to 47 months and not born before 1991 was 0.74 (0.59 and 0.88 for a vaccination coverage of 85% and 95% respectively). Vaccine efficacy was higher in PCR-positive cases (0.87; 0.79; 0.94) than in PCR-negative cases (0.54; 0.27; 0.78). Vaccination efficacy estimates on the basis of surveillance data are certainly less precise than those inferred from clinical trials. However, our results indicate that the efficacy of vaccination in children significantly declined with increasing age. Whooping cough still has the potential to cause epidemics in Switzerland in spite of a high vaccination coverage. With the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccines and new vaccination schemes in Switzerland, the Swiss Sentinel Network fulfills an important task as a monitoring system and contributes to the evaluation of new vaccination strategies."

CD011926,0,17962877,0,Toxoplasma gondii infection in pregnancy.,"Toxoplasmosis is caused by an intracellular protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii, which has a wide geographical distribution. The main infection routes are ingestion of cysts from raw or badly-cooked meat, ingestion of oocysts from substrates contaminated with the feces of infected felines and congenital transmission by tachyzoites. The congenital form results in a severe systemic disease, because if the mother is infected for the first time during gestation, she can present a temporary parasitemia that will infect the fetus. Many of the clinical symptoms are seen in congenitally-infected children, from a mild disease to serious signs, such as mental retardation. Early diagnosis during the pregnancy is highly desirable, allowing prompt intervention in cases of infection, through treatment of pregnant women, reducing the probability of fetal infection and consequent substantial damage to the fetus. Conventional tests for establishment of a fetal diagnosis of toxoplasmosis include options from serology to PCR. Prevention of human toxoplasmosis is based on care to avoid infection, understanding the disease and serological exams during gestation. Pregnant women should be tested serologically from three months gestation, until one month after childbirth. Inclusion of serology for congenital toxoplasmosis along with the basic Guthrie test for PKU is of fundamental importance for early diagnosis of infection and so that treatment is initiated, in order to avoid possible sequels in the infant."

Co-infection with different respiratory viruses is well documented but not necessarily well understood. The aim of this study was to utilise laboratory data from the winter season following the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) outbreak to investigate rates of respiratory virus co-infections, virus prevalence in different age groups and temporal variations in virus detection. The Health Protection Agency Public Health Laboratory (HPA PHL) Birmingham, UK, routinely uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect common respiratory viruses. The results from specimens received for respiratory virus investigations from late September 2009 to April 2010 were analysed. A total of 4,821 specimen results were analysed. Of these, 323 (13.2 %) had co-detections of two viruses, 22 (0.9 %) had three viruses and four (0.2 %) had four viruses. Reciprocal patterns of positive or negative associations between different virus pairs were found. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of negative associations between influenza A and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and influenza A and rhinovirus. Positive associations between parainfluenza with rhinovirus, rhinovirus with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus with rhinovirus, parainfluenza and RSV were also significant. Age and temporal distributions of the different viruses were typical. This study found that the co-detection of different respiratory viruses is not random and most associations are reciprocal, either positively or negatively. The pandemic strain of influenza A(H1N1) was notable in that it was the least likely to be co-detected with another respiratory virus."
CD011926,0,8083689,0,In situ PCR localization of herpes simplex virus DNA sequences in disseminated neonatal herpes encephalitis.,"To more precisely define the role of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in development of nervous system disease in neonates with disseminated infection, an in situ polymerase chain reaction (ISPCR) method was used to detect and localize HSV DNA sequences in paraffin sections of neural and non-neural autopsy tissues. In subregions of adjacent sections corresponding to ISPCR-labeled and unlabeled areas, HSV specificity was verified using solution PCR and Southern blots. In serial sections, ISPCR results were compared to lesions, HSV antigen and, in selected samples, to viral sequence detection by in situ hybridization. By ISPCR, HSV-specific labeling was limited to HSV-infected neonates and experimentally infected mouse controls. ISPCR-labeled cells corresponded to regions that were histologically abnormal and contained HSV antigen or in situ hybridization signal in some foci; in others, labeled cells were in areas with no evident lesions or antigen. Results suggest two routes of HSV spread to the CNS: (i) blood-borne infection, with HSV DNA in splenic lymphocytes, circulating cells, meningeal vessel walls and cells in intraventricular hemorrhage, and (ii) neural spread, with HSV detected in brain stem sensory neurons. In the brain of one neonate surviving acute infection, detection of HSV nucleic acid sequences suggests a latent or persistent viral genome. With other methods, this highly sensitive ISPCR technique permits a more complete definition of HSV infection in these infants and provides new insights into disease mechanisms. Fuller understanding of HSV persistence and recurrent neurological disease in survivors will require further studies using these and other techniques in human tissues and in animal models."

All surveillance (conducted every two weeks) and diarrheal samples from 20 children (n = 1,036) with cryptosporidial diarrhea previously identified by stool microscopy were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism for species and subgenotype determination. Thirty-five episodes of cryptosporidiosis were identified in 20 children, of which 25 were diarrheal. Fifteen episodes were associated with prolonged oocyst shedding. Multiple episodes of cryptosporidiosis occurred in 40% of the children. Most infections were with C. hominis, subtype Ia. Children with multiple infections had significantly lower weight-for-age and height-for-age Z scores at 24 months but had scores comparable with children with a single episode by 36 months. Multiple symptomatic Cryptosporidium infections associated with prolonged oocyst shedding occur frequently in this disease-endemic area and may contribute to the long-term effects of cryptosporidiosis on physical growth in these children."

Here, we compare macrophage tropism conferred by HIV-1 R5 envelopes that were derived directly by PCR from patient tissue. This approach avoids potentially selective culture protocols used in virus isolation. Envelopes were amplified (i) from blood and semen of adult patients and (ii) from plasma of pediatric patients. The phenotypes of these envelopes were compared to those conferred by an extended panel of envelopes derived from brain and lymph node that we reported previously. Our results show that R5 envelopes vary by up to 1,000-fold in their capacity to confer infection of primary macrophages. Highly macrophage-tropic envelopes were predominate in brain but were infrequent in semen, blood, and lymph node samples. We also confirmed that the presence of N283 in the C2 CD4 binding site of gp120 is associated with HIV-1 envelopes from the brain but absent from macrophage-tropic envelopes amplified from blood and semen. Finally, we compared infection of macrophages, CD4(+) T cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) conferred by macrophage-tropic and non-macrophage-tropic envelopes in the context of full-length replication competent viral clones. Non-macrophage-tropic envelopes conferred low-level infection of macrophages yet infected CD4(+) T cells and PBMCs as efficiently as highly macrophage-tropic brain envelopes. The lack of macrophage tropism for the majority of the envelopes amplified from lymph node, blood, and semen is striking and contrasts with the current consensus that R5 primary isolates are generally macrophage tropic. The extensive variation in R5 tropism reported here is likely to have an important impact on pathogenesis and on the capacity of HIV-1 to transmit."
CD011926,0,17570118,0,Combined multilocus sequence typing and O serogrouping distinguishes Escherichia coli subtypes associated with infant urosepsis and/or meningitis.,"The genetic relatedness of 223 invasive Escherichia coli strains that cause either meningitis or urosepsis without meningitis in young infants was determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), ribotyping, and phylogenetic polymerase chain reaction grouping. We also determined the serotypes and virulence genotypes (on the basis of 11 virulence genes). The strains belonged to 29 sequence type complexes (STc), 20 ribotypes, 26 O serogroups, and 39 virulence genotypes. MLST combined with O serogrouping identified 49 subtypes, or ""sequence O types."" Some sequence O types were almost exclusively associated with either urosepsis (STc27(O2), STc27(O6), and STc29(O2)) or meningitis (STc29(O18)). In contrast, STc29(O45) was equally frequent in these 2 infection sites. Similarly, several virulence genotypes were specifically associated with one of these syndromes. These results point to the existence of specialized invasive subtypes that cause urosepsis or meningitis in infants and identify a new dually virulent invasive clone."
CD011926,0,12613456,0,"IgA antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus in serum, saliva and urine for early diagnosis of immunodeficiency virus infection in Ugandan infants.","The value of HIV-1 IgA antibodies for early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants in serum, saliva and urine was investigated at Mulago Hospital, Kampala. Sensitivity and specificity in serum of HIV-infected infants at different ages were: 0 to 1 months, 88 and 95%; 1 to 3 months, 88 and 97%; 4 to 6 months, 80 and 96%. They decreased between 67 and 77% and 80 to 91%, respectively, in older age groups. Sensitivity for saliva was lower (53 to 79%) and urine only 37 to 62%, although specificity was reasonably high (>85%). The high proportion of infants with raised HIV IgA in the first months of life (88%) may represent prenatal infection. Sensitivity of serum and especially salivary and urinary HIV IgA is too low to be of practical value for early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants."
CD011926,0,21203810,0,"Efficient linking of birth certificate and newborn screening databases for laboratory investigation of congenital cytomegalovirus infection and preterm birth: Florida, 2008.","The objectives of this study are (1) to design an accurate method for linking newborn screening (NBS) and state birth certificate databases to create a de-identified study database; (2) To assess maternal cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroprevalence by measuring CMV IgG in newborn dried blood spots; (3) To assess congenital CMV infection among newborns and possible association with preterm birth. NBS and birth databases were linked and patient records were de-identified. A stratified random sample of records based on gestational age was selected and used to retrieve blood spots from the state NBS laboratory. Serum containing maternal antibodies was eluted from blood spots and tested for the presence of CMV IgG. DNA was extracted from blood spots and tested for the presence of CMV DNA. Analyses were performed with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Linkage rates and specimen collection exceeded 98% of the total possible yielding a final database with 3,101 newborn blood spots. CMV seroprevalence was 91% among Black mothers, 83% among Hispanic mothers, 59% among White mothers, and decreased with increasing amounts of education. The prevalence of CMV infection in newborns was 0.45% and did not vary significantly by gestational age. Successful methods for database linkage, newborn blood spots collection, and de-identification of records can serve as a model for future congenital exposure surveillance projects. Maternal CMV seroprevalence was strongly associated with race/ethnicity and educational level. Congenital CMV infection rates were lower than those reported by other studies and lacked statistical power to examine associations with preterm birth."
CD011926,0,22434821,0,Respiratory syncytial virus potentiates ABCA3 mutation-induced loss of lung epithelial cell differentiation.,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A3 (ABCA3) is a lipid transporter active in lung alveolar epithelial type II cells (ATII) and is essential for their function as surfactant-producing cells. ABCA3 mutational defects cause respiratory distress in newborns and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in children. The molecular pathomechanisms are largely unknown; however, viral infections may initiate or aggravate ILDs. Here, we investigated the impact of the clinically relevant ABCA3 mutations, p.Q215K and p.E292V, by stable transfection of A549 lung epithelial cells. ABCA3 mutations strongly impaired expression of the ATII differentiation marker SP-C and the key epithelial cell adhesion proteins E-cadherin and zonula occludens-1. Concurrently, cells expressing ABCA3 mutation acquired mesenchymal features as observed by increased expression of SNAI1, MMP-2 and TGF-β1, and elevated phosphorylation of Src. Infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most common viral respiratory pathogen in small children, potentiated the observed mutational effects on loss of epithelial and acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics. In addition, RSV infection of cells harboring ABCA3 mutations resulted in a morphologic shift to a mesenchymal phenotype. We conclude that ABCA3 mutations, potentiated by RSV infection, induce loss of epithelial cell differentiation in ATII. Loss of key epithelial features may disturb the integrity of the alveolar epithelium, thereby comprising its functionality. We suggest the impairment of epithelial function as a mechanism by which ABCA3 mutations cause ILD."
CD011926,0,12749681,0,Congenital cytomegalovirus infection.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital infection in humans. Congenital CMV infection can follow either a primary or recurrent maternal infection, but the likelihood of fetal infection and the risk of associated damage is higher after a primary infection. Approximately 90% of congenitally infected infants are asymptomatic at birth. Jaundice, petechiae, and hepatosplenomegaly are the most frequently noted clinical triad in symptomatic infants. More frequent and more severe sequelae occur in symptomatic infants, notably psychomotor hearing loss and retardation. Congenital CMV infection can be diagnosed by isolation of the virus from the urine or saliva within the first three weeks of life. Rapid diagnosis can be accomplished by detection of CMV DNA by DNA amplification or hybridization techniques."

CD011926,0,18855026,0,Unexpected substitution of dominant rotavirus G genotypes in French hospitalized children over five consecutive seasons.,"The study was designed to evaluate the circulation of group A rotaviruses in French hospitalized children, and to detect unusual strains. This prospective study was conducted from 2001 to 2006 in children consulting for acute diarrhea at the pediatric emergency department in three French University Hospitals. The rotaviruses were detected by rapid test and genotyped by RT-PCR on the basis of their outer capsid proteins VP4 (P-type) and VP7 (G-type). The stools from 757 children were analyzed. G1P[8] strains were predominant (44.0%), followed by G9P[8] (17.7%), G3P[8] 13.1%, G4P[8] (9.5%), and G2P[4] (1.8%); mixed rotavirus infections occurred in 2.3%. G9 rotaviruses emerged during the 2004-2005 season (73.4%) and remained the second most prevalent strains. Few unusual strains, G6, G8, G12 and P[6]-types, were detected. The monitoring of rotavirus infections should be maintained to document strain distribution and to assess the emergence of new reassortants that may not respond to current rotavirus vaccines."

The current study aimed to examine retrospectively stored specimens for the presence of HCoV-NL63 using nested RT-PCR assays targeting the 1a and 1b genes. The study population was composed of patients with acute respiratory disease warranting presentation to Queensland hospitals. HCoV-NL63 was detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of 16 of 840 specimens representing 766 patients (2%). HCoV-NL63 positive individuals were diagnosed most commonly with lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease (81%). The clinical diagnosis was commonly supported by an abnormal chest X-ray (56%) together with respiratory distress (50%), wheeze (44%), and rales (25%) on first presentation with HCoV-NL63 infection. All patients positive for HCoV-NL63 required admission to hospital. Among 38% of HCoV-NL63 positive specimens a second pathogen was detected. Sequencing of amplicon from gene 1b revealed more than 99% nucleotide homology with the viral type strains while sequencing amplicon from gene 1a permitted the grouping of viral strains. It was shown that HCoV-NL63 is associated with severe LRT disease in an Australian hospital setting during the cooler months of the year. We propose that HCoV-NL63 is a global and seasonal pathogen of both children and adults associated with severe LRT illness."

CD011926,0,18817577,0,Transplacental transmission of Human Papillomavirus.,"This paper aimed at studying the transplacental transmission of HPV and looking at the epidemiological factors involved in maternal viral infection. The following sampling methods were used: (1) in the pregnant woman, (a) genital; (b) peripheral blood; (2) in the newborn, (a) oral cavity, axillary and inguinal regions; (b) nasopharyngeal aspirate, and (c) cord blood; (3) in the placenta. The HPV DNA was identified using two methods: multiplex PCR of human beta-globin and of HPV using the PGMY09 and PGMY11 primers; and nested-PCR, which combines degenerated primers of the E6/E7 regions of the HPV virus, that allowed the identification of genotypes 6/11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 42, 52 and 58. Transplacental transmission was considered when type-specific HPV concordance was found between the mother, the placenta and the newborn or the mother and cord blood. The study included 49 HPV DNA-positive pregnant women at delivery. Twelve placentas (24.5%, n = 12/49) had a positive result for HPV DNA. Eleven newborn were HPV DNA positive in samples from the nasopharyngeal or buccal and body or cord blood. In 5 cases (10.2%, n = 5/49) there was HPV type-specific agreement between genital/placenta/newborn samples. In one case (2%, n = 1/49) there was type specific HPV concordance between genital/cord blood and also suggested transplacental transmission. A positive and significant correlation was observed between transplacental transmission of HPV infection and the maternal variables of immunodepression history (HIV, p = 0.011). In conclusion the study suggests placental infection in 23.3% of the cases studied and transplacental transmission in 12.2%. It is suggested that in future HPV DNA be researched in the normal endometrium of women of reproductive age. The possible consequence of fetal exposure to HPV should be observed."

CD011926,0,9427890,0,Acceptability and impact of zidovudine for prevention of mother-to-child human immunodeficiency virus-1 transmission in France.,"We studied the propagation and the impact of zidovudine prevention on the human immunodeficiency virus-1 transmission rate from infected mothers to their infants in the French nationwide prospective cohort. Infection was diagnosed in the children on the basis of at least two positive human immunodeficiency virus-1 polymerase chain reaction tests, culture, or both. The transmission rate among treated women was compared with that among untreated women during the same period and with that among women enrolled in the cohort since 1986. The impact of zidovudine was analyzed according to the women's clinical and biologic characteristics, the mode of delivery, and use of zidovudine therapy before the pregnancy. Nearly 90% of women were treated as soon as the second half of 1994. In 1994 and 1995, 80% of mother-child pairs received at least one of the three phases of preventive treatment. Among the 663 mothers enrolled during these 2 years, only six refused the treatment. Zidovudine treatment was associated with a reduction in the transmission rate of nearly two-thirds, from 14% +/- 6% to 5% +/- 2% (p < 0.01). The degree of reduction was not influenced by the maternal CD4+ cell count or p24 antigenemia at delivery. Zidovudine treatment of the mother before the pregnancy considerably reduced the impact of preventive therapy; the transmission rate was significantly higher among pretreated mothers (20% versus 5%, p < 0.01) even after adjusting for maternal CD4+ cell count. Zidovudine prevention is now widely used in France and has had a major impact on the epidemiology of mother-child human immunodeficiency virus transmission. This justifies a policy of offering human immunodeficiency virus screening to all women before or shortly after the diagnosis of pregnancy."
CD011926,0,11930994,0,"Detection of cytomegalovirus in infant cerebrospinal fluid by conventional PCR, nested PCR and PCR-Digene.","The possibility of amplification of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the diagnosis of HCMV central nervous system (CNS) infection in infants was studied. Single-step PCR, nested PCR and PCR-Digene were used to assay CSF specimens from 37 patients. Criteria for patient inclusion in the study were: 1. clinical manifestations suggesting CMV neuroinfection such as seizures, hypertonia, hypotonia, intracranial calcification, microcephaly, chorioretinitis; 2. any of the following symptoms: anaemia, hepetomegaly, prolonged cholestatic jaundice, or hepatitis, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, intrauterine hypotrophy; 3. serologic presentation, and/or positive results for CMV infection obtained by single-step PCR and PCR-Digene in urine and/or blood. PCR-Digene results were positive in 6 CSF samples. Four CSF samples were positive by nested PCR and 1 CSF sample by single step PCR. We found that the double PCR was about ten or more times more sensitive than single PCR and the PCR-Digene was only three times more sensitive than nested-PCR. The results were correlated with serology. Thirty-three out of 37 examined patients were seropositive (ELISA IgG); ELISA IgM gave positive results in 9 patients. In control studies, cells infected with other members of the herpes virus family were negative with these methods, which suggest that amplification combined with primers from the IE and the L-region of CMV is specific. In conclusion, nested-PCR seems to be the best method for early diagnosis of CMV infection in CSF due to an absence of false positive results and its high specificity and sensitivity."
CD011926,0,18003804,0,"Epidemiological, molecular, and clinical features of enterovirus respiratory infections in French children between 1999 and 2005.","Enteroviruses (EVs) can induce nonspecific respiratory tract infections in children, but their epidemiological, virological, and clinical features remain to be assessed. In the present study, we analyzed 252 EV-related infection cases (median age of subjects, 5.1 years) diagnosed among 11,509 consecutive children visiting emergency departments within a 7-year period in the north of France. EV strains were isolated from nasopharyngeal samples by viral cell culture, identified by seroneutralization assay, and genetically compared by partial amplification and sequencing of the VP1 gene. The respiratory syndromes (79 [31%] of 252 EV infections) appeared as the second most common EV-induced pediatric pathology after meningitis (111 [44%] of 252 cases) (44 versus 31%, P < 10(-3)), contributing to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in 43 (54%) of 79 EV respiratory infection cases. Bronchiolitis was the most common EV-induced LRTI (34 [43%] of 79 cases, P < 10(-3)) occurring more often in infants aged 1 to 12 months (P = 0.0002), with spring-fall seasonality. Viruses ECHO 11, 6, and 13 were the more frequently identified respiratory strains (24, 13, and 11%, respectively). The VP1 gene phylogenetic analysis showed the concomitant or successive circulation of genetically distinct EV respiratory strains (species A or B) during the same month or annual epidemic period. Our findings indicated that respiratory tract infections accounted for the 30% of EV-induced pediatric pathologies, contributing to LRTIs in 54% of these cases. Moreover, the concomitant or successive circulation of genetically distinct EV strains indicated the possibility of pediatric repeated respiratory infections within the same epidemic season."

CD011926,0,9350750,0,Laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system infections with herpes simplex virus by PCR performed with cerebrospinal fluid specimens.,"Until recently, the laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) infections with herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been limited by poor sensitivity and/or specificity. We assessed the diagnostic utility of PCR for detection of HSV in over 2,100 specimens referred to the Mayo Clinic from August 1993 to May 1996. DNA extracted from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples with IsoQuick was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotide primers directed to the DNA polymerase gene of HSV, yielding a 290-bp amplicon. HSV DNA was detected in 150 (135 by gel electrophoresis, 15 by Southern blotting only) of 2,106 (7.1%) specimens. PCR-positive CNS disease occurred in patients ranging in age from 13 days to 89 years; 59% of the cases occurred in patients between the ages of 30 and 69, and 21 (14%) of the patients were infants. Genotype analysis was not routinely performed; however, amplification of a 335-bp product within the thymidine kinase gene of HSV revealed 13 positions within a span of 80 nucleotides that accurately identified the two serotypes of the virus according to 14 reference strains. We conclude that PCR detection of HSV DNA in CSF specimens should be considered an emerging ""gold standard"" for the laboratory diagnosis of CNS infections with this virus."
CD011926,0,22644055,0,MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and microsatellite markers to evaluate Candida parapsilosis transmission in neonatal intensive care units.,"Recent studies on outbreaks of Candida showed an increased incidence of bloodstream infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) caused by C. parapsilosis species, highlighting the need for the proper identification and epidemiology of these species. Several systems are available for molecular epidemiological and taxonomic studies of fungal infections: pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) represents the gold standard for typing, but is also one of the most lengthy and expensive, while simple sequence repeats (SSRs) is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and is, therefore, faster. Only recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been used to identify and type microorganisms involved in nosocomial outbreaks. In our study, 19 strains of C. parapsilosis isolated from the blood cultures of neonates admitted to the University Hospital Federico II were genotyped by the amplification of eight SSR markers and by MALDI-TOF MS. Electrophoretic and spectrometric profile results were compared in order to identify similarities among the isolates and to study microevolutionary changes in the C. parapsilosis population. The discriminatory power and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrograms generated were compared in order to evaluate the correlation of the groups established by the analysis of the clusters by both methods. Both methods were rapid and effective in highlighting identical strains and studying microevolutionary changes in the population. Our study evidenced that mass spectroscopy is a useful technique not only for the identification but also for monitoring the spread of strains, which is critical to control nosocomial infections."
CD011926,0,23188574,0,[Molecular typing of adenoviruses isolated from clinical specimens by PCR and DNA sequencing methods].,"Adenoviruses are responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, including upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTIs and LRTIs, respectively), conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and hemorrhagic cystitis. The aim of this study was to determine the adenovirus (AdV) types isolated from clinical specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing methods. A total of 22 AdV strains isolated between January 1st 2011 to May 31th 2011, from various samples (295 nasopharyngeal swabs, 42 conjunctival swabs, 13 stool) sent to our routine virology laboratory were included in the study. Of the 22 patients whose samples yielded adenovirus positivity, 8 were adult (4 were male; median age: 32.5 years) and 14 (7 were male; median age: 1 year) were children. Those specimens (14 nasopharyngeal swabs, 7 conjunctival swabs, 1 stool) were obtained from patients with URTIs (n= 6), LRTIs (n= 8), conjunctivitis (n= 7) and gastroenteritis (n= 1). For the isolation and identification of adenoviruses, rapid (shell vial) cell culture and direct immunofluorescence antibody methods were used, respectively. Molecular typing of adenoviruses were performed by PCR and sequencing of a partial region (hipervariable region 1-6) of the hexon gene. PCR primers (Adhex F1, Adhex R1) used for DNA amplification were from those described by Lu and Erdman, previously. If insufficient DNA was amplified from the first reaction for sequencing, a nested PCR was performed using Adhex F2 and Adhex R2 primers. Sequencing was performed using the amplification primers and Sequence Reagent Mix-DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc, USA) on ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Obtained adenovirus sequences were typed by BLAST analysis and three AdV types namely type 3, 4, and 8 were identified. In our study, AdV type 3 was detected in a gastroenteritis case and six cases with URTIs and LRTIs (n= 7, 31.8%). AdV type 8 was identified as the cause of conjunctivitis in seven patients and of URTIs and LRTIs in five patients (n= 12, 54.5%). AdV type 4 was found to be associated with URTI in one, and LRTIs in two patients (n= 3; 13.7%). Our data indicated that AdV type 8 was the most prevalent type in patients with conjunctivitis and URTIs, while AdV type 3 was the most prevalent type in patients with LRTI. BLAST analysis was thought to be useful for the molecular typing of adenoviruses. In conclusion, advanced studies with large number of specimens are necessary to achive a reliable, detailed national adenovirus database."

The studies were performed on an archival paraffin material originating from five children deceased due to intrauterine infection. The results of immunocytochemical and hybridocytochemical studies, with or without amplification using biotinylated tyramine, were compared with the routine histopathological results and results obtained using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Early antigen (EA)-HCMV was demonstrated in approximately twice as many cells as detected in the routine staining and also in cells that seemed morphologically intact. The hybridocytochemical studies confirmed the presence of HCMV DNA in cells that were positive in the immunocytochemical tests and, in addition (using the ISH-immunomax technique), in cell nuclei of intact myocardial myocytes. In general, fewer cells manifested the presence of HMCV mRNA than the presence of HCMV DNA. The immunomax technique was found to be more sensitive than the techniques of classical immunocytochemistry or of ISH. The former technique permitted the documentation of a higher number of HCMV replication sites than could be detected using the latter techniques. However, the clinical course of HCMV infection or the cause of death of the children was not directly related to the intensity of HCMV expression in tissues."

We examined whether the number of HCMV DNA copies in BM is related to HCMV infection in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. We identified 11 pairs of VLBW infants and mothers. BM samples were collected every week until 10 weeks postpartum. Urine samples were collected from the infants within 1 week, at 6 to 8 weeks, at discharge, and whenever HCMV infection was suspected. HCMV DNA in BM was positive in 7 of 11 mothers and reached a peak at 4 to 5 weeks postpartum. Of the 11, 5 infants were determined to be infected from positive HCMV DNA in the urine, despite the fact that BM was used after being frozen. Of the five, four infected infants exhibited symptoms between 35 and 60 days of age. Symptomatic infants had longer stays and slower weight gain. The HCMV infection rate is high in very preterm infants. A new strategy to prevent HCMV infection other than freezing should therefore be established."

CD011926,0,18077639,0,Early infant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 detection suitable for resource-limited settings with multiple circulating subtypes by use of nested three-monoplex DNA PCR and dried blood spots.,"The early detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in infants is complicated by the persistence of maternal antibodies and by diverse HIV-1 subtypes. We developed a nested, three-monoplex HIV-1 DNA PCR (N3M-PCR) assay to detect diverse HIV-1 subtypes in infants born to infected mothers. We optimized the test for use with dried blood spot (DBS) samples for ease of storage and transport from rural China to central laboratories. Six pairs of primers were designed that targeted env, gag, and pol genes, and the test was run in three reactions with an analytical sensitivity of 10 copies DNA per reaction to cover nine HIV-1 subtypes, A, B, C, D, F, G, CRF01-AE, CRF08-BC, and CRF07-BC. The assay performance was evaluated on 347 DBS specimens from 151 exposed infants in four diverse provinces of China in which multiple subtypes were circulating. The results of this test were compared to those of HIV antibody enzyme immunoassay and Western blotting confirmation for the infants at > or =18 months of age or to convincing clinical and epidemiologic data for deceased infants. The sensitivity of the N3M-PCR assay was 30.0% (3/10) for infants at 48 h after birth, 91.7% (11/12) at 1 to 2 months of age, and 93.7% (15/16) at 3 to 6 months of age. The specificity was 100% (94/94) at all three time points. The PCR reproducibility in the three DNA regions was 100% for samples at 48 h after birth, 96.7% at 1 to 2 months, and 100% at 3 to 6 months of age. The HIV-1 DNA N3M-PCR assay on DBSs offers a simple and affordable approach for early infant HIV-1 diagnosis in regions with diverse HIV-1 circulating subtypes."

This paper provides an update on laboratory testing methods that assist the confirmation of clinical disease and investigation of outbreaks. Laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction or serology should be attempted, especially when atypical pertussis is suspected clinically. Genetic and antigenic variations in virulence factors of strains circulating in the population should also be monitored."
CD011926,0,15583287,0,Practical implementation of a multiplex PCR for acute respiratory tract infections in children.,"Molecular testing for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) has documented value but limited implementation due to questions that typically slow the acceptance of new tests. This study sought to address these questions and achieve implementation. Rhinovirus was added to a nested multiplex PCR (M-PCR), increasing its diagnostic yield. Over one winter, three hospital pediatric departments used the M-PCR to complement their direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Clinicians recorded ""pretest probability estimates"" (using continuous scales for various pathogen groups) for comparison with test results; treatments and test turnaround times were also recorded. Transnasal and throat swabs, with or without nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), were M-PCR tested. NPA-containing sample sets found to be RSV positive by DFA were not further tested. Single PCR for human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was performed retrospectively. Of 178 ARI episodes representing 172 patients, NPA was included in 97 sample sets; 54 (56%) were determined to be RSV positive. The other NPA-containing sample sets (n = 43) yielded 27 findings (63%), and the swab-only sets (n = 81) yielded 47 findings (58%); rhinovirus was found most often. Testing for hMPV yielded seven positive results. M-PCR median turnaround times were 4 days in swab-only samples and 5 days with NPA. Antibiotics were prescribed in 50 episodes, at rates similar for RSV and rhinovirus. Pretest probability estimates of a viral cause were lower in episodes caused by rhinovirus than in episodes caused by RSV. The hospitals continued to use M-PCR for NPA-containing samples found to be RSV negative by DFA. Test implementation is more likely with higher diagnostic yield and a protocol that reflects day-to-day clinical and laboratory operations."
CD011926,0,1816254,0,Storage and preservation of whole blood samples for use in detection of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 by the polymerase chain reaction.,"Methods used in the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) usually require the separation of lymphocytes from a whole-blood sample within 24 hours of patient sampling. A method is described in which blood samples are mixed with a cryopreservative ('Glycigel'), stored frozen, and DNA suitable for use in an HIV PCR recovered. Samples can be stored at -20 degrees C for up to 3 months and still give positive results with all samples from infected patients; storage at -80 degrees C for at least 3 months shows no loss of titre. The method shows no loss of sensitivity compared to previously described sample preparation methods. Deglycerolised Glycigel supernatants were found to be suitable for conventional anti-HIV-1 serological studies and loss of sensitivity only represented the dilution effect due to sample preparation. Application of the method as a means of storing samples frozen at the point of sampling and transporting them to a central laboratory for processing is demonstrated using samples taken from HIV-1-infected mothers and their babies."

We examine the role of S. aureus virulence factors for gut colonization. S. aureus isolated from quantitative stool cultures of 49 Swedish infants followed from birth to 12 months of age were assessed for 30 virulence-associated genes, spa type, and agr allele by serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Strains carrying genes encoding collagen-binding protein, and the superantigens S. aureus enterotoxin O/M (SEO/SEM) had higher stool counts than strains lacking these genes, whereas genes for S. aureus enterotoxin A (SEA) were associated with low counts. A cluster of strains belonging to agr allele I and the spa clonal cluster 630 (spa-CC 630) that carried genes encoding SEO/SEM, SEC, collagen-binding protein, and elastin-binding protein were all long-time colonizers. Thus, certain S. aureus virulence factors might promote gut colonization."

CD011926,0,23804382,0,PCR for detection of herpes simplex virus in cerebrospinal fluid: alternative acceptance criteria for diagnostic workup.,"The determination of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection using a PCR assay is one of the most commonly requested tests for analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although only a very low proportion of results are positive. A previously reported study showed that selecting only those CSF samples with >5 leukocytes/mm(3) or a protein level of >50 mg/dl was adequate for the diagnostic workup. The aim of the present study was to assess the reliability of alternative acceptance criteria based on elevated CSF white blood cell counts (>10 cells/mm(3)). We analyzed all requests for HSV PCR received between January 2008 and December 2011. CSF samples were accepted for analysis if they had >10 cells/mm(3) or if the sample was from an immunocompromised patient or a child aged <2 years. In order to evaluate our selection criteria, we identified those CSF samples with a leukocyte count of 5 to 10 cells/mm(3) or protein levels of >50 mg/dl in order to test them for HSV type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) DNA. During the study period, 466 CSF samples were submitted to the microbiology laboratory for HSV PCR. Of these, 268 (57.5%) were rejected, and 198 (42.5%) were tested according to our routine criteria. Of the tested samples, 11 (5.5%) were positive for HSV DNA (7 for HSV-1 and 4 for HSV-2). Of the 268 rejected specimens, 74 met the criteria of >5 cells/mm(3) and/or protein levels of >50 mg/dl. Of these, 70 (94.6%) were available for analysis. None of the samples yielded a positive HSV PCR result. Acceptance criteria based on CSF leukocyte counts, host immune status, and age can help to streamline the application of HSV PCR without reducing sensitivity."

Both neonate and her mother were isolated from other patients. The hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype was Ia. Total anti-HAV antibodies and HAV RNA were not detected from the newborn in a serum collected the first day of life; neither clinical symptoms nor increased ALT levels were observed during the six first days of life. The mother quickly and fully recovered. Hepatitis A has been scarcely reported during pregnancy; four cases, to our knowledge, have been previously described close to delivery. HAV vertical transmission seems to be very rare. No severe outcome has been described in mothers and newborns. Nevertheless, HAV infection might represent a concern in pregnant women in industrialized countries in view of its mortality rate among susceptible adults and its potential involvement in nosocomial outbreaks."

CD011926,0,20144201,0,Chronic infection during placental malaria is associated with up-regulation of cycloxygenase-2.,"Placental malaria (PM) is associated with poor foetal development, but the pathophysiological processes involved are poorly understood. Cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) which convert fatty acids to prostaglandins and leukotrienes, play important roles in pregnancy and foetal development. COX-2, currently targeted by specific drugs, plays a dual role as it associates with both pre-eclampsia pathology and recovery during infection. The role of COX during PM was questioned by quantifying at delivery COX-1, COX-2, 15-LOX, and IL-10 expression in two groups of malaria infected and uninfected placenta."
CD011926,0,19333631,0,Epidemiology of and prenatal molecular distinction between invasive and colonizing group B streptococci in The Netherlands and Taiwan.,"The identification of markers for virulent group B streptococci (GBS) could guide prenatal prevention and intervention strategies. We compared the distribution of serotypes and potential pathogenicity islands (PPIs) between invasive and colonizing GBS. Colonizing and invasive strains from The Netherlands and Taiwan were serotyped. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of several new PPI markers. Several combinations of PPI-specific markers and serotypes were associated with invasiveness. For Dutch neonatal strains, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with serotype and five PPI markers showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.963 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.935-0.99). For Taiwanese neonatal strains, serotype and four different PPI markers resulted in an ROC curve with an AUC of 0.894 (95% CI 0.826-0.963). PPI-specific and serological markers can distinguish local neonatal invasive GBS strains from colonizing ones. Apparently, there are clear regional differences in the GBS epidemiology and infection potential of clones."

CD011926,0,24361090,0,Molecular diagnosis of Arcobacter and Campylobacter in diarrhoeal samples among Portuguese patients.,"The present study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and diversity of Arcobacter and Campylobacter spp. in 298 stool samples of patients with diarrhoea, collected from 22 Portuguese hospitals, between September and November 2012. Detection of Arcobacter and Campylobacter spp. was performed using molecular-based detection techniques, such as real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer PCR, species-specific PCR, and sequencing of amplified PCR products. Overall, 1.3% of the samples were positive for Arcobacter butzleri and 0.3% for Arcobacter cryaerophilus. Campylobacter spp. were found in 31.9% of diarrhoeic faeces. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter concisus were the most prevalent species (13.7% and 8.0%, respectively). The prevalence of Arcobacter and Campylobacter spp. was significantly different between children and adults (39.7% versus 22.8%, P = 0.003). We underline the high prevalence of these pathogens in diarrhoeal samples among Portuguese patients, with particular relevance in the paediatric age group."
CD011926,0,1313070,0,Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus detected by nested polymerase chain reaction.,"Serum samples from eight pregnant women and their offspring were studied by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA to evaluate mother-to-child transmission of this virus. The mothers were all infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); none showed symptoms of HCV infection. Anti-HCV antibodies were tested for by recombinant immunoblot assay. HCV viral sequences were found in five of the mothers and four of eight children, three of them at birth. Viremia was persistent in one infant who had chronic transaminase elevation and persistently remained anti-HCV-positive. The other three babies had intermittent viremia; all were asymptomatic and lost anti-HCV antibodies during follow-up. This loss of antibodies was also observed in PCR-negative infants. Thus, these results demonstrate transmission of HCV from mother to child by women coinfected with HCV and HIV. They indicate the usefulness of PCR for direct and early detection of HCV viremia in neonates."
CD011926,0,14969566,0,"Presentation, diagnosis, and management of enterovirus infections in neonates.","The nonpoliovirus enteroviruses commonly infect newborns, with consequences ranging from asymptomatic infection and benign illness, to severe, life-threatening disease. Frequently occurring symptoms include fever, irritability, lethargy, anorexia, and rash. Although most illnesses are mild, severe disease develops in a subset of newborns infected in the first 2 weeks of life. Severe disease may consist of sepsis, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and/or coagulopathy. Substantial mortality rates have been reported, and long-term sequelae may occur among survivors. Risk factors and clinical features associated with severe disease include absence of neutralizing antibody to the infecting serotype, maternal illness prior to or at delivery, prematurity, illness onset within the first few days of life, multiorgan disease, severe hepatitis, positive serum viral culture, and specific infecting serotype (e.g. group B coxsackieviruses and echovirus 11). Whereas the mainstay of diagnosis has traditionally been viral isolation in tissue culture, the polymerase chain reaction has been demonstrated to be more sensitive than culture, highly specific, and rapid. Immunoglobulin has been used as a therapeutic agent for neonates with enterovirus disease; however, clinical efficacy has not been proven. Specific antiviral therapy for enteroviruses is in development. Pleconaril is an investigational agent that inhibits viral attachment to host cell receptors and uncoating of viral nucleic acid. It has broad and potent anti-enterovirus activity, excellent oral bioavailability, and is well tolerated. Some clinical trials have demonstrated benefit in children and adults with enterovirus meningitis, and in adults with upper respiratory tract infections caused by picornaviruses (rhinoviruses or enteroviruses). Data summarizing compassionate use for severe enterovirus diseases (including neonatal sepsis) also suggest possible benefit. Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in infants and neonates. A multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of pleconaril in neonates with severe hepatitis, coagulopathy, and/or myocarditis is currently being conducted."

The aim of this work was analysis of routine laboratory results obtained in Laboratory of Department of Virology NIZP-PZH by examination of materials obtained from 82 medical canters in Poland in aim of CNS infection confirmation. Materials, cerebrospinal fluid (CSN) n=277, and CSN together with serum (n=452) were obtained from patients aged from 3 days to 83 years. Accordingly with the range of tests performed in Laboratory of Department of Virology NIZP-PZH, obtained samples were examinated for 11 viral infections: HSV, CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV-6, HHV-7, TBE, measles, mumps, rubella and enteroviruses. Confirmation of viral infection was obtained in 104 out of 729 tested patients (14.3%). The highest number of confirmations was obtained in case of TBE infection (18.4%) and HSV (9.2%). The methods gave the highest number of confirmations were testing of intrathecal IgG synthesis (14.4%) and presence of IgM in serum (10.3%). If test was conducted only with CSF, confirmation of viral infection was obtained in 13 cases (4.7%). In conclusions it was ascertained that testing CSF and serum samples together greatly increase possibility of etiological agent detection and a range of ordered tests (i.e. intrathecal synthesis versus PCR) should account dynamics of pathological process."

TTV DNA was detected in 47.8% (n = 22) of the women. All but one child born to these women were also viremic for TTV from the first sample onward. TTV DNA was found in 73.9% (n = 17) of the breast milk samples derived from TTV viremic mothers. The one TTV-negative child born to a viremic mother remained negative during follow-up, although it was breast-fed. Our data show that TTV is highly effectively transmitted from mothers to their children during pregnancy. Although the majority of breast milk samples from viremic mothers are positive by TTV PCR, there is no need to discourage women from breast-feeding, because most children are TTV viremic even before breast-feeding begins."

Strain diversity, mixed infections and untypeable RVA strains are frequently reported in Africa. We analysed rotavirus-positive human stool samples (n=13) obtained from hospitalised children under the age of 5years who presented with acute gastroenteritis at sentinel hospital sites in six African countries, as well as bovine and porcine stool samples (n=1 each), to gain insights into rotavirus diversity and evolution. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis and genotyping with G-(VP7) and P-specific (VP4) typing primers suggested that 13 of the 15 samples contained more than 11 segments and/or mixed G/P genotypes. Full-length amplicons for each segment were generated using RVA-specific primers and sequenced using the Ion Torrent and/or Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing platforms. Sequencing detected at least one segment in each sample for which duplicate sequences, often having distinct genotypes, existed. This supported and extended the PAGE and RT-PCR genotyping findings that suggested these samples were collected from individuals that had mixed rotavirus infections. The study reports the first porcine (MRC-DPRU1567) and bovine (MRC-DPRU3010) mixed infections. We also report a unique genome segment 9 (VP7), whose G9 genotype belongs to lineage VI and clusters with porcine reference strains. Previously, African G9 strains have all been in lineage III. Furthermore, additional RVA segments isolated from humans have a clear evolutionary relationship with porcine, bovine and ovine rotavirus sequences, indicating relatively recent interspecies transmission and reassortment. Thus, multiple RVA strains from sub-Saharan Africa are infecting mammalian hosts with unpredictable variations in their gene segment combinations. Whole-genome sequence analyses of mixed RVA strains underscore the considerable diversity of rotavirus sequences and genome segment combinations that result from a complex evolutionary history involving multiple host species."

CD011926,0,20167006,0,Molecular diversity within clonal complex 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin in England and Wales.,"Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that are multi-locus sequence type clonal complex 22 (CC22) comprise a significant public health problem in the UK. In the present study we sought to determine the genetic diversity, and the respective patient demographics, among 47 PVL-MRSA with a CC22 pulsotype that occurred sporadically or in clusters in community and healthcare settings in eight of nine geographic regions in England and Wales between January 2005 and September 2007. Patient demographics and disease presentations were typical for PVL-S. aureus infections (mostly skin and soft tissue infections in individuals <40 years old); one patient with community-acquired pneumonia died. Although the isolates were closely genotypically related by spa typing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis, at least two variant groups were suggested. PCR detections demonstrated that the majority of the CC22 PVL-MRSA identified (n = 42; 89%) harboured SCCmecIVc, three had SCCmecIVd, one had SCCmecIV but was non-subtypeable, and one isolate harboured SCCmecV. At least three different PVL-encoding phages were detected: ФPVL, Ф108PVL and an unidentified icosahedral phage. Agar dilution MIC determinations showed that the CC22 PVL-MRSA identified were typically resistant to gentamicin and trimethoprim (43 of 47 isolates) and ciprofloxacin resistance was also noted in six isolates. In conclusion, the CC22 PVL-MRSA tested were geographically disseminated but highly genetically related. The observed variances in acquired elements (most notably SCCmec and PVL-encoding phages) suggested that CC22 PVL-MRSA in England and Wales have evolved on multiple occasions."

Diagnosis is made by detecting the genome using RT-PCR. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a positive diagnosis on the management of infants, children, and adults. During 2005, 442 patients were admitted to hospital with suspected meningitis. Clinical and laboratory data and initial treatment were recorded for all patients with enteroviral meningitis. The turnaround time of tests and the length of hospital stay were analyzed. The results showed that EV-PCR detected EV in 69 patients (16%), 23% (16/69) were adults. About 18% of CSF samples had no pleocytosis. After positive PCR results, 63% of children were discharged immediately (mean 2 hr 30 min) and 95% within 24 hr. Infants and adults were discharged later (after 1.8 and 2 days, respectively). The use of antibiotics was significantly lower in children than in infants and adults. The PCR results allowed discontinuation of antibiotics in 50-60% of all patients treated. Patients received acyclovir in 16% of cases (7% children vs. 50% adults) and 23% (11% vs. 69%) underwent a CT scan. Clinical data were compared between patients whose positive EV-PCR results were available within 24 hr (n = 32) and those whose results were available > 24 hr after collection of CSF (n = 14). Duration of antibiotic treatment (difference: 2.3 days; P = 0.05) was reduced between the two groups. No statistical difference in the length of stay was observed. The EV-PCR assay should be performed daily in hospital laboratory practice and considered as part of the initial management of meningitis."
CD011926,0,10325333,0,Nasopharyngeal carriage of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae among children with acute respiratory tract infections in Thailand: a molecular epidemiological survey.,"The prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in Thailand has dramatically increased over the last decade. During a national survey, which was conducted from 1992 to 1994, 37.2% of the pneumococci isolated from the nasopharynges of children with acute respiratory tract infections were penicillin resistant (MIC, >/=0.1 microg/ml). In order to investigate the prevalence and clonal relatedness of nasopharyngeal carriage of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in Thailand, a molecular epidemiological survey was undertaken. To this end, 53 penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates from children who suffered from acute respiratory tract infections and who originated from five distinct regions of the country were characterized in detail. DNA fingerprint analysis demonstrated 13 clusters, i.e., genotypes shared by two or more strains, and 14 unique genotypes. The cluster size varied from 2 (nine clusters) to 11 strains (one cluster). Six of the 13 restriction fragment end labeling clusters consisted of two or more distinct serotypes, indicating frequent horizontal transfer of capsular genes. Geographical distribution of the genotypes among the five regions of Thailand demonstrated that only four genetic clusters were restricted to single areas of the country, whereas the other nine clusters represented isolates collected in two or more districts. These observations demonstrate that the majority of the genetic clusters are spread throughout the country. The most predominant genetic cluster, representing 21% of the isolates, was identical to the Spanish pandemic clone 23F. In addition, the second largest cluster matched the Spanish-French international clone 9V. These data indicate that the genetic clones 23F and 9V, which are widely spread throughout the world, are the most predominant multidrug-resistant pneumococcal clones in Thailand. Therefore, we conclude that these pandemic clones are primarily responsible for the increase in the prevalence of pneumococcal penicillin resistance in Thailand."

CD011926,0,19099851,0,[Influence of congenital asymptomatic cytomegalovirus infection on development of infants].,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous human-specific DNA virus and is the main cause of congenital virus infection worldwide. Although 90% of the congenitally infected infants are clinically asymptomatic at birth, evidences show that these infants are at risk for audiologic, neurologic, and developmental sequelae. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of children with asymptomatic congenital human cytomegalovirus infection identified from a cohort of newborn infants screened for congenital HCMV infection compared with matched uninfected control subjects."

CD011926,0,18794287,0,Association of IS1016 with the hia adhesin gene and biotypes V and I in invasive nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.,"A subset of invasive nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) strains has evidence of IS1016, an insertion element associated with division I H. influenzae capsule serotypes. We examined IS1016-positive invasive NTHI isolates collected as part of Active Bacterial Core Surveillance within the Georgia Emerging Infections Program for the presence or absence of hmw1 and hmw2 (two related adhesin genes that are common in NTHI but absent in encapsulated H. influenzae) and hia (homologue of hsf, an encapsulated H. influenzae adhesin gene). Isolates were serotyped using slide agglutination, confirmed as NTHI strains using PCR capsule typing, and biotyped. Two hundred twenty-nine invasive NTHI isolates collected between August 1998 and December 2006 were screened for IS1016; 22/229 (9.6%) were positive. Nineteen of 201 previously identified IS1016-positive invasive NTHI isolates collected between January 1989 and July 1998 were also examined. Forty-one IS1016-positive and 56 randomly selected IS1016-negative invasive NTHI strains were examined. The hia adhesin was present in 39 of 41 (95%) IS1016-positive NTHI strains and 1 of 56 (1.8%) IS1016-negative NTHI strains tested; hmw (hmw1, hmw2, or both) was present in 50 of 56 (89%) IS1016-negative NTHI isolates but in only 5 of 41 (12%; all hmw2) IS1016-positive NTHI isolates. IS1016-positive NTHI strains were more often biotype V (P < 0.001) or biotype I (P = 0.04) than IS1016-negative NTHI strains, which were most often biotype II. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the expected genetic diversity of NTHI with some clustering based on IS1016, hmw or hia, and biotypes. A significant association of IS1016 with biotypes V and I and the presence of hia adhesins was found among invasive NTHI. IS1016-positive NTHI strains may represent a unique subset of NTHI strains, with characteristics more closely resembling those of encapsulated H. influenzae."
CD011926,0,8880481,0,Urine sample used for congenital toxoplasmosis diagnosis by PCR.,"The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in congenitally infected infants can be difficult; serology is unreliable, and diagnosis must be based on the combination of symptomatology and direct demonstration of the parasite. Four infants suspected of having Toxoplasma gondii infection were studied by serological analysis, tissue culture, and PCR determination. T. gondii was isolated from the urine of one patient. The parasite was detected by PCR in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of three infants and in the urine in all patients. Because nested PCR proved to be a sensitive, relatively rapid, and specific method and because it can be applied to a variety of different clinical samples, PCR can be a valuable technique for the identification of T. gondii infections in children. The present study indicates that PCR examination of urine, a fluid never before used for diagnosis in this age group, may be valuable in diagnosing cases of congenital toxoplasmosis."

All 64 cases were unilateral, 27 left and 37 right. There were 28 male and 36 female patients with a ratio of 1:1.3. The mean age of the patients was 52.0 years, and their average duration of symptoms was 29.3 months. The mean longest diameter of the cysts was 3.0 cm. Histologically, lymphoepithelial cysts were classified into 3 subtypes: type I, a cystic dilation of ducts within parotid glands (9 cases, 14.1%); type II, partially demarcated cystic lesions with lymphoid stroma (27, 42.2%); type III, well-encapsulated cystic lesions with lymphoid stroma containing lymph follicular structures (28, 43.8%). Based on immunohistochemical results for lymphocyte/macrophage (CD20/CD45RO/IgG4), cell cycle (Ki-67), and lymphatic (D2-40) markers, the lymphoid stroma was shown to have neither the usual lymph follicular distributions of T/B cells nor lymph sinus structures. No viral infection was confirmed. The results seemed to indicate that the lymphoid stroma were induced along with the growth of the cystic dilatation of ducts within sialadenitis, which were neither induced by Epstein-Barr virus nor HIV infections, and that the formation of lymphoepithelial cysts was completed by demarcation, which should have been a kind of granulation tissue reaction, from the parotid parenchyma but did not arise from intraparotid lymph nodes."

CD011926,0,23363824,0,Comparison of Anyplex II RV16 with the xTAG respiratory viral panel and Seeplex RV15 for detection of respiratory viruses.,"A novel multiplex real-time PCR approach (Anyplex II RV16 [RV16]; Seegene, South Korea) was compared with a multiplex endpoint PCR kit (Seeplex RV15 ACE detection kit [RV15]; Seegene) and a liquid bead-based assay (xTAG respiratory viral panel [xTAG]; Abbott, United States). Of nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples submitted for RV15 testing, 199 retrospectively collected positive specimens and 283 prospectively collected specimens were further tested with RV16 and xTAG. A true-positive result was defined as a positive result from all three methods or RV16 and xTAG or RV15 and xTAG. For specimens with discrepant results, monoplex PCR and sequencing of the target viruses were performed. In total, 300 virus-positive specimens yielded 386 viruses. When the bocavirus results were excluded, the overall sensitivities of RV16, RV15, and xTAG were 95.2%, 93.3%, and 87.2%, respectively (95% confidence intervals, 93.0 to 97.4%, 90.8 to 95.8%, and 83.8 to 90.6%, respectively). RV16 was more sensitive than xTAG for coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (100% versus 26.1%; P < 0.0001) and adenovirus (100% versus 79.5%; P < 0.01) but was less sensitive than xTAG for rhinovirus/enterovirus (89.4% versus 97.9%; P < 0.05). RV16 demonstrated higher sensitivity than RV15 for the detection of adenovirus (100% versus 82.1%; P < 0.05). The specificities of all three methods ranged from 98.6% to 100%. Sequencing analysis of 64 rhinovirus-positive samples revealed that RV16 accurately differentiated between rhinovirus and enterovirus. RV16 most frequently missed rhinovirus C. In conclusion, the overall sensitivity of RV16 was better than that of xTAG. However, improvement of the sensitivity for rhinovirus is required."
CD011926,0,8902439,0,Prenatal diagnosis of fetal cytomegalovirus infection in seropositive pregnant women.,"Thirty two pregnant women, immune to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) before conception, were examined with a combination of amniocentesis, and blood sampling for fetal HCMV infection. The pregnant women had no history of recurrent infection and they all had normal ultrasonographic findings. Maternal sera and amniotic fluids were examined for anti-HCMV antibodies and viral DNA by enzyme immunoassay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All maternal sera were negative for viral DNA and IgM anti-HCMV antibodies. However, HCMV DNA was detected in the amniotic fluid of four pregnant women. These four cases were considered as fetal HCMV infections. Three of them were followed up after birth. The three neonates appeared clinically normal at birth, but HCMV DNA was detected in their urine specimens and in two of them in the cord blood sera. Although the neonates were asymptomatic at birth, the possibility of developing sequelae later on, cannot be excluded. The results show that HCMV recurrent maternal infection is silent and difficult to be suspected and diagnosed. They also show that fetal HCMV infection is not rare among pre-immune pregnant women."

CD011926,0,22378195,0,Outbreak of bullous impetigo caused by Staphylococcus aureus strains of phage type 3C/71 in a maternity ward linked to nasal carriage of a healthcare worker.,"We describe an outbreak of bullous impetigo (BI) that occurred in a maternity unit and show phenotypic and genotypic properties and relatedness of isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains. Clinical material was obtained from 11 affected neonates. Additionally, nasal swabs from 67 healthy care workers (HCWs) as well as 107 environmental swabs were investigated. All isolates were screened for exfoliative toxin genes (eta, etb), antibiotic susceptibility and phage typed. Chromosomal DNA was genotyped by MLVF method and PCR/RFLP of coagulase gene were tested. Affected neonates were infected by two clusters of eta-positive S. aureus of phage type 3C/71: (1) MLVF type A isolates resistant only to penicillin, and (2) MLVF type B isolates resistant to penicillin and erythromycin/clindamycin. All isolates were susceptible to methicillin. We found 19 of 67 HCWs to be S. aureus nasal carriers. Two nasal isolates from HCWs were related to the outbreak on the basis of phage typing, PCR detection of eta/etb genes, antibiotyping and genotyping. Additionally, environmental swabs from the maternity unit revealed a 3C/71 S. aureus in the mattress of a baby bed. This is the first documented case of an outbreak of BI caused by phage type 3C/71 eta-positive strain of S. aureus."
CD011926,0,20686081,0,"Incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infections in Auckland, New Zealand.","Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) has been linked to invasive community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. However, the association between disease and PVL-positive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) has not been widely reported. We aimed to examine the epidemiology of PVL in clinical MSSA isolates from patients presenting to Auckland City Hospital. Four hundred eleven MSSA clinical isolates and 93 nasal carriage isolates were collected and tested for the presence of the lukSF-PV genes using PCR. The results were examined in light of host and disease factors. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed on a random subset of isolates to ensure that there was no single PVL-positive MSSA clone responsible for disease in Auckland. The prevalence of the lukSF-PV genes in MSSA isolates associated with disease (124/335; 37%) was not significantly different from the prevalence of the lukSF-PV genes in MSSA nasal carriage isolates (29/93; 31% [P = 0.33]). PVL-positive MSSA isolates in Auckland are genetically diverse and come from a number of different clonal complexes. PVL-positive infections peaked at between 10 and 20 years of age, with a subsequent decline. Pacific ethnicity, age, diagnosis of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), community-onset infection, and the need for surgical intervention were found by multivariate analysis to be independently associated with PVL-positive MSSA infection. More than one-third of MSSA infections in our patient population are caused by PVL-positive strains. Those patients with PVL-positive MSSA infection were more likely to be of Pacific ethnicity, be younger in age, have community-onset infection, have SSTI, and need surgical intervention."
CD011926,0,10932728,0,Association between hemolytic uremic syndrome and verotoxin-producing strains of E. coli.,"One of the most frequent etiologic agents of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is Escherichia coli O157H7, a microorganism that possesses virulence factors (Shiga-like Toxins I and II and adhesion fimbriae). The present study was set up to determine the relationship between HUS and the presence of Verotoxin in patients of ""Niño Jesús"" Children's Hospital. Tucumán, Argentina. 19 Children between 0 and 4 years old suffering from HUS (typical and atypical symptoms) and 15 control children of similar sex and age were selected. Presence of enterohemorrhagic E. coli was studied in both groups using molecular hybridization techniques. Free Verotoxin and Verotoxin-producing E. coli were analyzed in Vero cells. The following results were obtained: 1) The cytotoxic effect on Vero cells from fecal filtrates was observed in all children suffering from HUS 2) Verotoxin-producing E. coli was detected in only 12 of them 3) None of the filtrates of feces from control children presented a cytotoxic effect on Vero cells 4) In 8 of the patients suffering from HUS serotype O157H7 was isolated, in one O55K59 and in 3 typification of E. coli was not possible with the serums assayed 5) 77.5% of the strains isolated from HUS patients gave a positive molecular hybridization reaction, showing the following: Adhesion Fimbriae (AF) (25%); AF + Shiga-like Toxin I (13.75%); AF + Shiga-like Toxin II (20%); AF + Shiga-like Toxins I and II (41.25%). In patients suffering from atypical HUS a combination of AF + Shiga-like Toxins I and II was found. The 15 control children did not hybridize to the probes assayed. From the results obtained we may conclude that there exists a relationship between HUS and the presence of Verotoxin in the children suffering from HUS studied. The predominant serotype in our cases was O157H7 and Shiga-like Toxin II was found with highest frequency."

In a subset of 50 mother-infant pairs, we also correlated infant outcome with maternal quantitative viral burden as measured by the nucleic acid sequence based amplification system. We found that low maternal CD4+ cell count and high viral burden were associated with decreased time to category C disease or death in infants infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In a multivariate analysis, high maternal viral load and maternal acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were independently associated with shorter time to category C disease or death in infants with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. High viral load in pregnant women, independent of the presence of advanced maternal disease, appears to increase the risk of rapidly progressive disease in their infected offspring."

This rapid culture assay (RCA) was compared blindly to a conventional culture assay (CCA) on a panel of 180 children's stool specimens received for routine diagnosis of enterovirus infection. The same cell lines (human embryonic fibroblasts and KB continuous cell line) were used in both tests. Discrepancies in results were analysed by a PCR technique with primers located in a conserved part of the 5' non-coding region of the enterovirus genome. Fourteen specimens were positive and 158 were negative with both tests. Four samples were positive with the RCA yet negative with the CCA and 3 others showed the opposite pattern; an additional sample positive by RCA was uninterpretable by CCA due to bacterial contamination. Subsequent PCR testing of these 8 samples showed no discrepancies; all were positive. Using CCA as the reference, the sensitivity and specificity of RCA were 77.8 and 98% respectively. Kinetic studies using enterovirus isolates demonstrated that RCA was much more sensitive than CCA during the first three days of culture. These results further suggested that RCA sensitivity could be improved by a factor of at least 10 times by prolonging the incubation period by 24 hr. With this change, the RCA assay described below is suggested as a rapid alternative to CCA for the routine diagnosis of enterovirus infection in stool specimens. When an identification at the serotype level is required, samples found positive using RCA could then be subjected to CCA."

While a viral etiology has been suspected based on the morphology, to date no virus has been successfully cultured from the brain in patients with Rasmussen's encephalitis. We describe the pathologic findings and report the detection of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) in the brain in two patients who presented primarily with intractable seizures. In the first patient, an intrauterine infection was suspected as the underlying basis for the seizure disorder and the extensive cerebral calcification and gliosis. The second patient (with presumed HSV1 encephalitis at age 7 months) underwent a temporal lobectomy for medically refractory seizures at the age of 3 years and pathologic examination revealed a chronic encephalitis. While immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and culture studies were negative for viral pathogens, molecular analysis by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed HSV1 DNA sequences in both cases. Thus our cases represent two examples of chronic encephalitis associated with a seizure disorder, where a definitive viral etiology was documented by PCR."
CD011926,0,8736602,0,Fetal parvovirus B19 infection and liver disease of antenatal onset in an infant with Ebstein's anomaly.,"Fetal parvovirus B19 infection has been reported in association with hydrops and fetal demise, myocarditis, and congenital anomalies, as well as with normal outcome of pregnancy. One infant with liver disease of fetal onset associated with parvovirus B19 infection has been described. We have seen another such infant, in whom marked siderosis of the liver suggested accelerated destruction of erythrocytes and portal tract fibrosis with proliferation of bile ducts suggested intrauterine infection. Viral cytopathic effects were not seen. Maternal serum obtained postpartum contained IgM class antibodies against parvovirus B19, and parvovirus B19 nucleic acid sequences were identified in the infant's liver by polymerase chain reaction studies. We propose that recognition of this combination of siderosis with fibrosis and bile duct proliferation will permit identification of cases of fetal parvovirus B19 infection."

CD011926,0,12716377,0,Characteristic perforin gene mutations of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients in Japan.,"Perforin gene (PRF1) mutations appear to occur in about 30% of patients with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). We tested perforin expression and gene mutations in 14 HLH patients and six patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated HLH (EBV-HLH) in Japan. Five of the 14 HLH patients had perforin abnormalities. The presence of PRF1 genetic abnormality correlated well with the lack of perforin expression as determined by flow cytometry. Sequencing showed that four patients had a compound heterozygous mutation while the fifth patient had a homozygous mutation. Three of the mutations we detected were novel. In contrast, none of the six EBV-HLH patients showed perforin abnormalities. Our data, combined with the PRF1 mutations in three previously reported Japanese patients, suggest that the 1090-1091delCT and 207delC mutations of the perforin gene are frequently present in Japanese HLH patients (62.5% and 37.5% respectively). Examination of the geographical origins of the ancestors in the perforin-mutant HLH patients revealed that they mostly came from the Western part of Japan, suggesting that the present-day cases may largely derive from a common ancestor."
CD011926,0,21763205,0,Deficient T Cell Receptor Excision Circles (TRECs) in autosomal recessive hyper IgE syndrome caused by DOCK8 mutation: implications for pathogenesis and potential detection by newborn screening.,"Loss of function of DOCK8 is the major cause of autosomal recessive hyper IgE syndrome, a primary immunodeficiency with adaptive and innate immune dysfunction. Patients affected with ARHIES have atopic dermatitis and recurrent, potentially life-threatening viral and bacterial infections. Three consanguineous Pakistani siblings presented with severe atopic dermatitis and superinfection. Direct sequencing of DOCK8 in all three affected siblings demonstrated homozygosity for a deleterious, novel exon 14 frame shift mutation. Current newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID) and related T cell disorders relies on the quantitation of T Cell Receptor Excision Cells (TRECs) in dried blood spots (DBS). Significantly, both older affected siblings had undetectable TRECs, and TREC copy number was reduced in the youngest sibling. These findings suggest that AR-HIES may be detected by TREC newborn screening, and this diagnosis should be considered in the evaluation of newborns with abnormal TRECs who do not have typical SCID."

CD011926,0,17634306,0,"Serotype IX, a Proposed New Streptococcus agalactiae Serotype.","We identified three isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), of human origin, which failed to react with antisera against any of the nine known GBS serotypes. Polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against these isolates and standard GBS typing sera were used in capillary precipitation and Ouchterlony tests to compare the strains with known GBS serotype reference strains. All three previously nontypeable isolates reacted with all three new antisera, producing lines of identity in the Ouchterlony test. Weak cross-reactions with antisera against several GBS serotypes were observed but were removed by absorption with corresponding antigens. The new antisera were used to test 227 GBS isolates that had been nontypeable or difficult to type using standard antisera. Of these, five reacted with the new antisera. These results suggested that all eight isolates belong to the previously unrecognized GBS serotype. They were tested by Western blotting for the Calpha and Cbeta proteins and by PCR to identify molecular serotypes and surface protein antigen genes. Two segments of the cps gene cluster (3' end of cpsE-cpsF and 5' end of cpsG, approximately 700 bp; 3' end of cpsH and 5' end of cpsM, approximately 560 bp) were sequenced. All eight isolates expressed Calpha, and seven expressing the Cbeta protein and the corresponding genes, bca and bac, respectively, were identified. They all share the same, unique partial cps sequence. These results indicate that these eight isolates represent a new S. agalactiae serotype, which we propose should be designated serotype IX."

The impairment of proliferation was not reversed by exogenous IL-2, phosphonoacetic acid, indomethacin or anti-alpha or anti-gamma interferon antibodies. HSV DNA was detected by hybridization in DNA extracted from unseparated MNC and from subsets sorted for CD3+ and for HLA DR+ expression. HSV DNA replication was not detected by thymidine uptake and only small amounts of virus were recovered in an infectious centre assay, suggesting that infection was non-permissive. Nevertheless, in-vitro synthesis of a limited range of HSV proteins including ICP4 was detected by metabolic labelling."
CD011926,0,15004072,0,Surveillance of childhood influenza virus infection: what is the best diagnostic method to use for archival samples?,"Despite the clinical importance of influenza virus in pediatric respiratory infections, the optimal set of diagnostic tests to use when conducting studies using archival samples is not clear. In this study, we compared diagnostic tests for influenza virus in 75 children younger than 5 years of age who presented with symptomatic respiratory infection during one of four influenza seasons, had negative viral cultures for other respiratory pathogens, and had both an archival nasal aspirate obtained at the time of illness and serology spanning that influenza season. For all eligible children, we compared the results of viral culture performed at the time of collection with serology and PCR of archival nasal aspirates. Using real-time viral culture as the ""gold standard,"" the test characteristics of PCR of archival nasal aspirates (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 100%) and serology (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 87%) were similar. The relatively low sensitivity of PCR of archival nasal samples in this study compared to that of PCR of fresh samples in a previous study suggests that RNA degradation occurred despite storage of the specimens at -70 degrees C. RNA degradation would also explain why only 11 (52%) of 21 archival nasal samples that had positive influenza virus cultures at the time of collection had positive repeat cultures in the summer of 2000. Thus, in archival specimens stored at -70 degrees C, PCR was more sensitive than viral culture. However, testing of fresh specimens had the highest yield in this study. Studies of optimal methods for specimen storage are needed."
CD011926,0,21620897,0,Detection of nine respiratory RNA viruses using three multiplex RT-PCR assays incorporating a novel RNA internal control transcript.,"Real-time PCR is a significant improvement over viral isolation and immunofluorescence for routinely detecting respiratory viruses. We developed three real-time internally controlled multiplex RT-PCR assays for detecting nine respiratory viruses. An internal control transcript consisting of a chimeric plasmid was synthesised and incorporated into each multiplex to monitor amplification efficiency, including inhibition. Each multiplex assay was developed on the Rotor-Gene 3000 and evaluated using RNA extracts from 126 nasopharyngeal aspirates from 112 pre-term infants. All 44/126 (35%) samples positive by immunofluorescence were confirmed by multiplex RT-PCR. Additionally, respiratory syncytial virus RNA was detected in 5 samples, influenza A virus RNA in 2 samples and thirteen (10%) dual infections by multiplex RT-PCR were noted. Inclusion of the RNA internal control did not affect the amplification efficiency of the target sequences and only 2 of 1256 (0.2%) samples tested over a 12 month period were inhibitory. Together with the improved sensitivity of the internally controlled multiplex RT-PCR assays over the older technology and the ability to detect co-infections, the internal control monitored the efficiency of both the RT and PCR steps and indicated inhibition, saving time and costs on running duplicate samples with a ""spiked"" inhibition control."
CD011926,0,25459782,0,Preventing herpes simplex virus in the newborn.,"Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are very common worldwide. Approximately 22% of pregnant women are infected genitally with HSV, and most of them are unaware of this. The most devastating consequence of maternal genital herpes is HSV disease in the newborn. Although neonatal HSV infections remain uncommon, due to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the infection, HSV infection in the newborn is often considered in the differential diagnosis of ill neonates. This review summarizes the epidemiology and management of neonatal HSV infections and discusses strategies to prevent HSV infection in the newborn."
CD011926,0,20739481,0,Rapid detection of respiratory tract viral infections and coinfections in patients with influenza-like illnesses by use of reverse transcription-PCR DNA microarray systems.,"We prospectively tested 95 nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from 56 adults and 39 children visiting the Reims University Medical Centre (northern France) for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) during the early stage of the French influenza A/H1N1v pandemic (October 2009). Respiratory samples were tested using a combination of two commercially available reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) DNA microarray systems allowing rapid detection of influenza A virus strains, including the new A/H1N1v strain as well as 20 other common or newly discovered respiratory viruses. Concomitantly, a generic and classical real-time RT-PCR assay was performed to detect all circulating influenza A virus strains in the same samples. Of the 95 respiratory samples tested, 30 (31%) were positive for the detection of influenza A/H1N1v virus infection by both RT-PCR DNA microarray and classical real-time RT-PCR detection assays. Among the infections, 25 (83%) were monoinfections, whereas 5 (17%) were multiple infections associating influenza A/H1N1v virus with coronavirus (CoV), human bocavirus (HBoV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or human rhinoviruses (HRVs). Of the 95 respiratory samples tested, 35 (37%) were positive for respiratory viruses other than influenza A/H1N1v virus. Among these infections, we observed 30 monoinfections (HRVs [63%], parainfluenza viruses [PIVs] [20%]), influenza A/H3N2 virus [6%], coronavirus [4%], and HBoV [4%]) and 5 multiple infections, in which HRVs and PIVs were the most frequently detected viruses. No specific single or mixed viral infections appeared to be associated significantly with secondary hospitalization in infectious disease or intensive care departments during the study period (P > 0.5). The use of RT-PCR DNA microarray systems in clinical virology practice allows the rapid and accurate detection of conventional and newly discovered viral respiratory pathogens in patients suffering from ILI and therefore could be of major interest for development of new epidemiological survey systems for respiratory viral infections."
CD011926,0,10878065,0,"Evaluation of performance of the Gen-Probe human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viral load assay using primary subtype A, C, and D isolates from Kenya.","Accurate and sensitive quantification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA has been invaluable as a marker for disease prognosis and for clinical monitoring of HIV-1 disease. The first generation of commercially available HIV-1 RNA tests were optimized to detect the predominant HIV-1 subtype found in North America and Europe, subtype B. However, these tests are frequently suboptimal in detecting HIV-1 genetic forms or subtypes found in other parts of the world. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the performance of a new viral load assay with non-subtype B viruses. A transcription-mediated amplification method for detection and quantitation of diverse HIV-1 subtypes, called the Gen-Probe HIV-1 viral load assay, is under development. In this study we examined the performance of the Gen-Probe HIV-1 viral load assay relative to that of the commonly used commercial HIV-1 RNA assays using a panel of primary isolates from Kenya. For comparison, we included several subtype B cloned viruses, and we quantified each virus using an in-house quantitative-competitive reverse transcriptase PCR (QC-RT-PCR) method and gag(p24) antigen capture. The Gen-Probe HIV-1 viral load assay and a version of the Roche AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR test (version 1.5) that was designed to detect a broader range of subtypes were both sensitive for the quantification of Kenyan primary isolates, which represented subtype A, C, and D viruses. The Gen-Probe HIV-1 viral load assay was more sensitive for the majority of viruses than the Roche AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR test version 1.0, the Bayer Quantiplex HIV RNA 3.0 assay, or a QC-RT-PCR method in use in our laboratory, suggesting that it provides a useful method for quantifying HIV-1 RNAs from diverse parts of the world, including Africa."

CD011926,0,15180658,0,Analyzing time-to-event data in a clinical trial when an unknown proportion of subjects has experienced the event at entry.,"In some clinical trials, where the outcome is the time until development of a silent event, an unknown proportion of subjects who have already experienced the event will be unknowingly enrolled due to the imperfect nature of the diagnostic tests used to screen potential subjects. For example, commonly used diagnostic tests for evaluating HIV infection status in infants, such as DNA PCR and HIV Culture, have low sensitivity when given soon after infection. This can lead to the inclusion of an unknown proportion of HIV-infected infants into clinical trials aimed at the prevention of transmission from HIV-positive mothers to their infants through breastfeeding. The infection status of infants at the end of the trial, when they are more than a year of age, can be determined with certainty. For those infants found to be infected with HIV at the end of the trial, it cannot be determined whether this occurred during the study or whether they were already infected when they were enrolled. In these settings, estimates of the cumulative risk of the event by the end of the study will overestimate the true probability of event during the study period and hypothesis tests comparing two or more intervention strategies can also be biased. We present inference methods for the distribution of time until the event of interest in these settings, and investigate issues in the design of such trials when there is a choice of using both imperfect and perfect diagnostic tests."

On admission, the patient's symptoms were similar to those of acute bronchiolitis. However, occasional apneic episodes with cyanosis and peripheral lymphocytosis suggested neonatal pertussis and prompted us to examine the presence of Bordetella pertussis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based on the insertion sequence IS481. LAMP of the nasopharyngeal and intratracheal aspirates was positive for B. pertussis and a diagnosis of neonatal pertussis was made. As the clinical features of pertussis in neonates and early infancy are not characteristic, LAMP is a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of B. pertussis infection."

This study aims to determine the incidence, genetic diversity and intertype variability of HAstV-1 in children less than 5 years of age enrolled in several studies conducted in Belém/Pará, and São Luís/Maranhão, Brazil, from December 1982 to May 2000. Using EIA and RT-PCR, an overall positivity of 6.1% (155/2.534) was achieved, of these, 140 were positive by RT-PCR. The analysis of a 348bp ORF2 fragment revealed that HAstV-1 was the predominant genotype (85/140, 60.7%) throughout the 18 years of study. Phylogenetic analysis was performed for 81 of these strains, and 76 (93.8%) were genetically classified as HAstV-1a. The remainder of strains (n=5) were assigned to possible new lineages, 1e and 1f. Four of these five strains were detected in 1983 and 1984, and the lineage 1a circulated during 10 consecutive years (1990/2000). Genome sequence variation was found among the HAstV-1 strains involving all lineages, but only five nucleotide changes translated into aminoacid changes over this period, suggesting that HAstV-1 was very stable. The data obtained in this study should be useful for further studies at molecular level, including improvement of disease surveillance based on molecular diagnostic tools, and vaccine development."
CD011926,0,8184179,0,"[Toxoplasmosis in pregnancy. Prevention, diagnosis, and therapy].","Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide health problem. Infection of a pregnant woman can result in severe fetal morbidity or in subclinical neonatal infection; most subclinical cases will develop ocular and neurological sequelae. Fetal infection and clinical outcome is related to when in pregnancy toxoplasmosis was acquired. The risk of transmission increases from 14% in the first trimester to 29% in the second and 59% in the third. Conversely, clinical damage decreases from about 80% in the first to 10% in the third trimester, but up to 50% of patients with subclinical congenital toxoplasmosis will develop neurologic and ocular sequelae. Congenital toxoplasmosis can be prevented by identification of non immune women at the beginning of pregnancy, by giving information on how to avoid the infection and by a serological follow-up until the delivery. Serological follow-up is based on repeated testing for specific IgG and IgM, but other serologic methods are necessary to differentiate between acute and chronic infections and possibly on a single serum sample. Procedures to detect fetal infection are ultrasound examination, cordocentesis and amniocentesis; prenatal diagnosis relies on demonstration of toxoplasma in fetal blood or amniotic fluid by mouse inoculation. Very promising results have recently obtained by the PCR-method applied to amniotic fluid samples. All strongly suspected cases of acquired toxoplasmosis in pregnancy have to be treated."
CD011926,0,17078856,0,Detection of cytomegalovirus in human placental cells by polymerase chain reaction.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common cause of viral intrauterine infection. Progress in rapid, specific, and dependable detection of HCMV has recently been achieved by the use of DNA hybridization techniques and other molecular methods. We examined 21 placentas after delivery for the presence of HCMV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To test the reliability of the PCR for the detection of HCMV DNA in clinical specimens, two simple PCR assays and a real-time quantitative PCR were used. PCR analysis of villous and decidual cells showed that HCMV DNA was present in 16 placentas (76.2%). Transmission of HCMV infection to chorionic villi was confirmed in 11 organs (52.4%), and congenital infections in newborns were detected in 9 cases (42.8%). These results suggest that HCMV genome detection in placentas at later gestational ages is common. Our results demonstrated that detection of HCMV DNA in placental tissues by DNA amplification provides a specific and sensitive method for diagnosis of intrauterine HCMV infection."

CD011926,0,23979089,0,Severe early-onset colitis revealing mevalonate kinase deficiency.,"Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D is the less severe form of mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) caused by recessive inherited mutation in the mevalonate kinase gene. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D is characterized by febrile attacks, often associated with transient digestive manifestations, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Here we report for the first time 2 patients with MKD revealed by severe neonatal colitis. Both patients had chronic bloody diarrhea and failure to thrive; 1 patient since the age of 1 month and the other since the age of 12 days. Total parenteral nutrition was required. A marked elevation of acute phase reactants was present, and no evidence of infection was found. In patient 1, ileocolonoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis at the age of 5 months. Patient 2 suffered from enterocolitis and shock, associated with multiple bowel adhesions at age 5 weeks; the rectosigmoidoscopy showed aphtoid lesions of the sigmoid colon. Pathologic findings of colonic biopsies revealed a dense polymorph inflammatory infiltrate associated with deep ulcerations. Febrile attacks occurred 2 months after the onset of digestive symptoms in patient 1, and at onset of disease in patient 2. Genomic sequencing of the mevalonate kinase gene revealed compound heterozygous mutations in both patients. Anti-interleukin-1 agent produced long-term remission of all digestive features and laboratory parameters. This report emphasizes that MKD may be the cause of severe early-onset inflammatory colitis, and must be considered by physicians, even in the absence of fever, after ruling out infections. Anti-interleukin-1 therapy may result in a dramatic improvement of MKD-related inflammatory bowel disease."

RSV and HRV were frequently detected in patients with bronchiolitis, and hMPV was frequently associated with pneumonia. HCoV-NL63 was found to be one of the causative agents of acute respiratory wheezing in young children. No seasonal variation was found in the incidence of detection of HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 or HBoV. This 3-year study demonstrated that viral pathogens play an important role in children with ALRTIs, and more attention should be paid to these newly identified viral agents."
CD011926,0,10877489,0,Coreceptor usage of HIV-1 isolates representing different genetic subtypes obtained from pregnant Cameroonian women. European Network for In Utero Transmission of HIV-1.,"In this study, coreceptor usage of HIV-1 other than subtype B in relation to HIV-1 transmission from mother to child was investigated. Repeated sampling of 42 HIV-1-seropositive, asymptomatic women in Cameroon during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, at delivery, and 6 months postpartum were performed. Env subtyping was carried out from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by heteroduplex mobility assay and, whenever necessary, by DNA sequencing. Virus isolates were tested for coreceptor usage on human cell lines-U87.CD4 and GHOST(3)-engineered to express stably CD4 and the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4, or the orphan receptors BOB/gpr15 or Bonzo/STRL33/TYMSTR. Transmission rate was 11.9%. Viruses were predominantly envelope subtype A and used CCR5 as coreceptor and, surprisingly, 4 of 28 (14.2%) isolates from mothers and 1 of 3 isolates from children used the orphan receptor Bonzo as well. In 2 transmitting mothers from whom sequential HIV-1 isolates were available, viral coreceptor usage evolved from CCR5 monotropic to CCR5/Bonzo dual tropic during pregnancy, and in 1 case transmission of this virus could be documented. Our data suggest that evolution of HIV-1 coreceptor usage to dual (or multi-) tropism may occur during pregnancy."

Seven hundred and fifty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for 17 viral agents. In each assay, the sensitivity and specificity for each target were determined against a composite reference standard. Two hundred and eighty-eight out of 750 (38.4%) specimens were positive by DFA or viral isolation, while an additional 214 (28.5%) were positive by multiplex PCR, for a total positivity rate of 66.9%. Of 502 positive specimens, one virus was detected in 420 specimens (83.7%), two in 77 (15.3%), three in four (0.8%) and four in one case (0.2%). Compared with a composite reference standard, the inter-assay accuracy of the multiplex PCR assays varied, but all were superior to conventional diagnostic methods in detecting a broad range of respiratory viral agents in children.

CD011926,0,26468545,0,Sabin Vaccine Reversion in the Field: a Comprehensive Analysis of Sabin-Like Poliovirus Isolates in Nigeria.,"To assess the dynamics of genetic reversion of live poliovirus vaccine in humans, we studied molecular evolution in Sabin-like poliovirus isolates from Nigerian acute flaccid paralysis cases obtained from routine surveillance. We employed a novel modeling approach to infer substitution and recombination rates from whole-genome sequences and information about poliovirus infection dynamics and the individual vaccination history. We confirmed observations from a recent vaccine trial that VP1 substitution rates are increased for Sabin-like isolates relative to the rate for the wild type due to increased nonsynonymous substitution rates. We also inferred substitution rates for attenuating nucleotides and confirmed that reversion can occur in days to weeks after vaccination. We combine our observations for Sabin-like virus evolution with the molecular clock for VP1 of circulating wild-type strains to infer that the mean time from the initiating vaccine dose to the earliest detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) is 300 days for Sabin-like virus type 1, 210 days for Sabin-like virus type 2, and 390 days for Sabin-like virus type 3. Phylogenetic relationships indicated transient local transmission of Sabin-like virus type 3 and, possibly, Sabin-like virus type 1 during periods of low wild polio incidence. Comparison of Sabin-like virus recombinants with known Nigerian vaccine-derived poliovirus recombinants shows that while recombination with non-Sabin enteroviruses is associated with cVDPV, the recombination rates are similar for Sabin isolate-Sabin isolate and Sabin isolate-non-Sabin enterovirus recombination after accounting for the time from dosing to the time of detection. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the evolutionary dynamics of the oral polio vaccine in the field."

CD011926,0,21852348,0,Variability of neuD transcription levels and capsular sialic acid expression among serotype III group B Streptococcus strains.,"Serotype III group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the major cause of neonatal meningitis, but the risk of infection in the colonized neonates is variable. Capsular sialic acid (Sia), whose synthesis is encoded by neu genes, appears to be a major virulence factor in several bacterial species able to reach the cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, variations of Sia expression related to the genetic diversity of strains may have an impact on the risk of meningitis in colonized neonates. We characterized by MLST the phylogenetic diversity of 64 serotype III GBS strains isolated from vaginal flora and randomly selected. These strains mostly belonged to three major sequence types (STs): ST1 (11%), ST17 (39%) and ST19 (31%). The genetic diversity of strains of these lineages, characterized by PFGE, allowed the selection of 17 representative strains, three ST1, six ST17 and eight ST19, with NEM316 as reference, in order to evaluate (i) by quantitative RT-PCR, the level of transcription of the neuD gene as a marker for the transcription of neu genes and (ii) by enzymological analysis, the expression of Sia. The mean transcription level of neuD was higher for ST17 strains than for ST1 and ST19 strains in the early, mid- and late exponential growth phases, and was maximum in the early exponential growth phase for ST17 strains and in the mid-exponential growth phase for ST1 and ST19 strains. Mean Sia concentration was higher for ST17 than for ST1 and ST9 strains in all three growth phases. For the total population, Sia concentration varied notably in the stationary phase, from 0.38 to 9.30 nmol per 10(8) viable bacteria, with a median value of 2.99 nmol per 10(8) bacteria. All ST17 strains, only one-third of the ST19 strains and none of the ST1 strains had Sia concentrations higher than the median Sia concentration. Therefore, differences in the level of expression of Sia by strains of the major serotype III GBS phylogenetic lineages might be one of the factors that explain the leading role of ST17 strains in neonatal meningitis."
CD011926,0,25178670,0,Clinical application of viral cerebrospinal fluid PCR testing for diagnosis of central nervous system disorders: a retrospective 11-year experience.,"The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard to detect cerebral viral activity. As positive findings do not prove an impact on the neurological disorder, data interpretation is difficult. To better assess the impact of positive CSF PCR findings in different neurological diseases and to identify coherences facilitating CSF PCR data interpretation, we performed this retrospective analysis of CSF PCR data of 481 pediatric and 2604 adult patients, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and enteroviruses (EV). Nucleic acid of EBV was detected in 1.6% (39/2449), of VZV in 1.3% (34/2624), of HSV in 1.24% (37/2994), of EV in 0.4% (10/2364), of HHV-6 in 0.17% (4/2417), and of CMV in 0.2% (5/2514) of the patients. Newborns and elderly people showed highest infection rates. HSV, VZV, and EV prevailed in typical infectious central nervous system (CNS) diseases; EBV, in further inflammatory neurological diseases; HSV and EBV, in immunocompromised patients; and EBV, HSV, and HHV-6, in further non-inflammatory neurological diseases. Analysis of successive PCR studies revealed delayed viral detection for EBV (6/147) and HSV (1/217), respectively. Rapid viral clearance was typical for HSV, VZV, CMV, and EV infections, although the maximum duration of viral detection was 15days for HSV and 12days for VZV, respectively. This suggests that the detection of HSV, VZV, CMV, and EV strongly indicates symptomatic viral CNS disease. Secondary viral reactivation mostly underlies positive EBV and HHV-6 findings. Their detection does not rule out clinical impact but recommends searching for additional underlying conditions."
CD011926,0,16087730,0,Suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins in human preterm placental tissues.,"Decreased suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) activity in human gestational tissues may play a part in the onset/progression of term labor. Since SOCS proteins negatively regulate cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes, we hypothesized that SOCS proteins are elevated in gestational tissues from spontaneous preterm deliveries with intrauterine infection. SOCS1, -2 and -3 mRNAs and proteins were detectable by RT-PCR and immunoblotting respectively, in preterm amnion, choriodecidua and placenta, irrespective of infection status. Immunoperoxidase staining localized SOCS1, -2 and -3 to all cell types of the gestational membranes, with infiltrating leukocytes reacting strongly in infected tissues. In villous placenta, SOCS was immunolocalized to the syncytiotrophoblast with marked staining of round mesenchymal cells, possibly Hofbauer cells. Nuclear SOCS staining was seen in amnion, chorion and placental syncytiotrophoblasts. SOCS proteins were, in general, significantly more abundant in placenta compared with amnion or choriodecidua. Placental SOCS1 and interleukin-1beta concentrations were positively correlated (r(2)=0.47; P<0.05). However, no changes in SOCS levels in any tissues were observed with intrauterine infection. The relatively large amounts of SOCS proteins in the placenta may reflect a placenta-specific immunoprotective response to minimize the elaboration and effects of cytokines with potential to harm the placenta and fetus. Lack of labor-associated changes in SOCS levels suggests that the regulation of SOCS expression in preterm gestational tissues differs from those at term, perhaps reflecting roles in regulating placental somatotropic responses."

However, adenovirus infection can occasionally result in severe or lethal infection. Fifty-five adenovirus serotypes are known today, and they are classified into 7 subgroups (subgroups A to G). Here we examined 282 samples derived from hospitalized patients in Israel (September 2006 to August 2008) who were diagnosed as suffering from adenovirus infections. We used a recently described PCR amplification method and subsequent sequencing to identify the adenovirus. In addition, we studied the medical charts of 106 hospitalized patients from Sheba Medical Center in Israel. The most prevalent adenovirus serotypes found were serotypes 1 (22.8%), 2 (19.2%), 7 (18%), and 3 (14%). In addition, we identified several serotypes that have not been identified previously in Israel. Overall, serotypes of subgroup B were found to be approximately 4 times more prevalent among immunocompromised children than among generally healthy children (52.6%; P < 0.007). The realization that the virus subtypes are different among healthy and immunocompromised patients may lead to more efficient treatment of adenovirus infections among immunocompromised children in the future."
CD011926,0,19936660,0,Neonatal cytomegalovirus infection: diagnostic modalities available for early disease detection.,"CMV is a ubiquitous virus. In India, there is high seroendemicity with almost 99% adults showing IgG antibodies. Infection or re-activation becomes important in immunocompromised host (Transplant recipients, Cancer therapy patients and patients with HIV/AIDS). Neonates form a distinctive high risk population for congenital CMV infection and suffer disastrous sequlae of the same. Neonatal infections may be congenital in nature or may be acquired after birth during first month of life via infected breast milk or due to exposure to high risk blood products. The risk for transmission of the virus to the fetus is higher in primary infected mothers than in mothers with reactivated disease. Primary CMV infections are reported in 1-4% of seronegative women during pregnancy and the risk for viral transmission to fetus is 30-40%. Reactivation of a CMV infection during pregnancy is reported in 10-30% of seropositive women and the risk of transmitting the virus is about 1-3%. The adverse outcome of congenital neonatal CMV infection includes-microcephaly (70%), intellectual impairment (60%), sensineural hearing loss (35%), choriorenitis (22%), hepatosplenomegaly (70%), jaundice (68%), thrombocytopenia (65%), low birth weight (65%), pneumonitis (2-5%) and congenital heart disease (<5%). About 5-10% of congenitally infected asymptomatic infants will have neurological problems later in life the most common of which is unilateral or bilateral sensory neural hearing loss. All immunocompromised hosts, including pre-term neonates, mount weak antibody responses (IgM), making serological detection of CMV infection in them, fallacious. Thus, it is imperative to use antigen detection methods such as quantitative PCR or PP65 Antigenaemia assays to detect CMV infection in immunocompromised host. Sakhuja et al and Minz et al have demonstrated that PP65 Antigenaemia assay is very good for diagnosing CMV disease in renal transplant recipients. The present review tends to highlight the role of newer diagnostic modalities in early CMV infection detection in neonatal population."
CD011926,0,9534989,0,Natural history of Epstein-Barr virus infection in a prospective pediatric cohort born to human immunodeficiency virus-infected mothers.,"To determine whether Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) constitutes a contributing factor in AIDS and, conversely, whether the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) alters the course of primary EBV infection in a pediatric population, 62 children born to HIV-infected mothers and prospectively followed were evaluated. EBV infection was documented by EBV-specific serology and polymerase chain reaction and by clinical history. HIV infection status was determined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pediatric classification system. Demographics from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children were comparable. The data suggest that HIV-infected children may acquire primary EBV infection earlier in life. The incidence of accompanying splenomegaly or hepatomegaly (or both) around the time of EBV seroconversion was higher among HIV-infected children than among HIV-uninfected children. In contrast, HIV disease progression and HIV-1 RNA load did not seem to be influenced by primary EBV infection."

A thin blood smear was performed, which showed the presence of intraerythrocyte bacteria identified as Bartonella bacilliformis, and subsequently, the child was diagnosed with Carrion's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by specific polymerase chain reaction. The child was born in a non-endemic B. bacilliformis area and had not traveled to such an area before hospitalization. However, the mother was from an endemic B. bacilliformis area, and posterior physical examination showed the presence of a wart compatible with B. bacilliformis in semi-immune subjects. These data support vertical transmission of B. bacilliformis."

CD011926,0,17105821,0,Gene expression patterns in blood leukocytes discriminate patients with acute infections.,"Each infectious agent represents a unique combination of pathogen-associated molecular patterns that interact with specific pattern-recognition receptors expressed on immune cells. Therefore, we surmised that the blood immune cells of individuals with different infections might bear discriminative transcriptional signatures. Gene expression profiles were obtained for 131 peripheral blood samples from pediatric patients with acute infections caused by influenza A virus, Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) or Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) bacteria. Thirty-five genes were identified that best discriminate patients with influenza A virus infection from patients with either E coli or S pneumoniae infection. These genes classified with 95% accuracy (35 of 37 samples) an independent set of patients with either influenza A, E coli, or S pneumoniae infection. A different signature discriminated patients with E coli versus S aureus infections with 85% accuracy (34 of 40). Furthermore, distinctive gene expression patterns were observed in patients presenting with respiratory infections of different etiologies. Thus, microarray analyses of patient peripheral blood leukocytes might assist in the differential diagnosis of infectious diseases."

CD011926,0,8395553,0,Electrophoretic typing of nosocomial rotavirus infection in a general paediatric unit showing the continual introduction of community strains.,"During 1989 stool specimens from hospitalised children with gastroenteritis at Ga-Rankuwa Hospital in South Africa were examined for the presence of rotaviruses. Overall 16% of the children were positive for rotavirus. However, 43% of the rotavirus positive patients were infected in the hospital. Further characterisation of the rotavirus strains was performed by electrophoresis of the RNA genome and hybridisation analysis of the VP7 and VP4 genes present. The strains associated with nosocomial infection were similar to those strains acquired in the community. The majority of the strains, both community- or hospital-acquired, were associated with a serotype 1 strain with a long electrophoretype and bearing the Wa-like VP4 gene. Three minor rotavirus strains with a long electrophoretype were also observed to be circulating bearing serotype 1 or 4 VP7 genes and the Wa-like VP4 gene. Interestingly, a serotype 4 strain bearing the M37-like VP4 gene was identified to occur almost exclusively in neonates although the gene was associated with diarrhoea in these cases. Two strains with differing short RNA electrophoretypes were also observed, members of which hybridised to VP7 serotype 2 and VP4 DS-1 type probes."
CD011926,0,7533124,0,Reovirus 3 not detected by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis of preserved tissue from infants with cholestatic liver disease.,"Reovirus type 3 has been implicated in the origin and pathogenesis of extrahepatic biliary atresia and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, but routine detection of this virus in hepatobiliary tissues from affected infants by culture and histological techniques has been unsuccessful. In this study, oligonucleotide primers specific to the M3 genome segment of reovirus 3 (Dearing) were used in a reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction technique to develop a sensitive and specific assay for the detection of reovirus 3 RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded patient samples. Optimal reaction conditions were determined by testing infected murine tissues and preserved human liver tissue supplemented with reovirus 3. Archival specimens from 50 infants, including 14 with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 20 with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, and 16 age-matched controls, were evaluated. Successful amplification of human albumin complementary DNA from the preserved tissues confirmed the presence of intact RNA in every patient specimen tested. Analysis of the amplification reactions by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization detected the presence of reoviral RNA only once in a single patient sample. These results do not support a strong role for reovirus 3 in the development of neonatal cholestatic liver disease. The recent association of other RNA viruses of the Reoviridae family with murine liver disease and human extrahepatic biliary atresia indicates that continued investigation into a viral cause for idiopathic neonatal hepatobiliary disease is warranted."
CD011926,0,2568996,0,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli serotype O111:HNT isolated from preterm neonates in Nairobi, Kenya.","This investigation was initiated as a consequence of several cases of diarrhea in a nursery ward for preterm babies in Nairobi, Kenya. Ten lactose-positive colonies were isolated from the stools of each of 30 neonates, regardless of whether they had diarrhea; 229 strains were identified as Escherichia coli and 65 strains were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Six strains were lost during laboratory handling. No other bacterial, viral, or parasitic enteropathogens were identified. Using synthetic alkaline phosphatase-labeled probes, the bacterial isolates were found to be negative for the presence of genes coding for heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxins. Seventy-eight E. coli strains isolated from a total of 13 neonates possessed the E. coli enteropathogenic adhesion factor (EAF) gene, as demonstrated by the use of a cloned radiolabeled DNA fragment probe. These strains possessed similar plasmid profiles constituting a core plasmid profile, and while all adhered to HeLa cells, none produced Vero cell cytotoxins. The EAF gene was located on a 65-megadalton plasmid. Serotyping showed the strains to be of serogroup O111 and serotype H nontypable, a well known enteropathogenic type. Five neonates died during the outbreak, and the fatality rate was 30.7% (4 of 13) for neonates infected with EAF-positive E. coli strains compared with 7.7% (1 of 13) for neonates from whom only EAF-negative E. coli strains were isolated. K. pneumoniae only was isolated from five neonates."

Detection of B. pertussis was based on the amplification of a section of the IS481 insertion sequence and confirmation of positive results was based on a sequence of the pertussis toxin promoter region. Detection of B. parapertussis was based on the amplification of a section of the IS1001 insertion sequence. An internal control was included. Data were available for the period 28 November 2000 to 9 July 2003. In this period, 3096 patients were examined for infection with B. pertussis and B. parapertussis by culture and PCR on the same day. B. pertussis was found in 496 (16 %) patients; 208 (42 %) were diagnosed by PCR alone whereas 17 (3 %) were diagnosed by culture alone. B. parapertussis was found in 64 (2 %) patients. The sensitivity of the PCR was 97 % and of culture 58 %. The specificity of PCR was 93 % when regarding culture as 100 % sensitive. There was a significant relationship between laboratory method and age, as the superiority of PCR was most marked in the age group 0.5-3 years. The PCR assay proved highly sensitive for the diagnosis of pertussis. The specificity estimate of the PCR assay suffers from the influence of a gold-standard method with a low sensitivity. The PCR assay is considered highly specific due to the amplification of two different sequences in two separate assays."
CD011926,0,17873993,0,"RT-PCR for confirmation of echovirus 30 isolated in Belém, Brazil.","Echovirus (Echo) 30 or human enterovirus B is the most frequent enterovirus associated with meningitis cases. Epidemics and outbreaks of this disease caused by Echo 30 have occurred in several countries. In Brazil, Echo 30 has been isolated from sporadic cases and outbreaks that occurred mainly in the south and southeast regions. We used RT-PCR to examine Echo 30 isolates from meningitis cases detected from March 2002 to December 2003 in Belém, state of Pará, in northern Brazil. The patients were attended in a Basic Health Unit (State Health Secretary of Pará), where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected and stored in liquid nitrogen. Weekly visits were made by technicians from Evandro Chagas Institute to the health unit and samples were stored at -70 degrees C in the laboratory until use. HEp-2 and RD cell lines were used for viral isolation and neutralization with specific antisera for viral identification. RNA extraction was made using Trizol reagent. The RT-PCR was made in one step, and the total mixture (50 microL) was composed of: RNA, reaction buffer, dNTP, primers, Rnase inhibitor, reverse transcriptase, Taq polymerase and water. The products were visualized in agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide, visualized under UV light. Among the 279 CSF samples examined, 30 (10.7%) were EV positive, 29 being Echo 30 and one was Cox B. Nineteen Echo 30 were examined with RT-PCR; 18 tested positive (762 and 494 base pairs). The use of this technique permitted viral identification in less time than usual, which benefits the patient and is of importance for public-health interventions."
CD011926,0,17310084,0,"Molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hospitals in Niigata, Japan: divergence and transmission.","The major methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) distributed among hospitals in Japan is New York/Japan clone [multilocus sequence type 5 (ST5), agr type 2 and methicillin resistance locus type (SCC mec) II] which possesses both the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 gene (tst) and staphylococcal enterotoxin C gene (sec). In this study, we collected 245 MRSA strains from four hospitals during 2001 to 2005 in Niigata, Japan, and analyzed tst and sec genes and SCC mec type among them. A total of 13 strains were further examined for their genotypes, virulence gene patterns and drug resistance. Among the 245 strains four tst sec genes patterns were observed; tst(+) sec(+) strains represented a majority of 86.5% and 9.4% were tst(-) sec(-). SCCmec typing revealed that 91.4% had type II, 4.1% type IV and 4.1% type I. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that 10 of the 13 typed strains belonged to clonal complex 5 (7 had ST5 while 3 were single locus variants of ST5) with similar characteristics to the New York/Japan clone and possessed multi-drug resistance with high virulence gene content. The remaining 3 strains were ST8 (n=2) and ST91 (n=1). The ST91 strain had SCC mec IV and seemed to originate in the community, while ST8 strains exhibited SCC mec type I, which is distinct from community type IV. The data suggest that MRSA in hospitals in Niigata now mainly includes the New York/Japan clone (undergoing genomic divergence and clonal expansion) and other minor types (e.g. ST8) as well as the community type."
CD011926,0,8720324,0,"[Prenatal and perinatal infections--problems for the practicing pediatrician: group B streptococci, varicella, toxoplasmosis].","A practical approach is reported for the care of the neonate born to a mother infected/colonized during pregnancy by group B streptococcus, varicella-zoster virus or Toxoplasma gondii. Starting from clinical situations, an attempt is made to work out evidence based recommendations using an overview of the current literature. GROUP B STREPTOCOCCI: Relevant factors for the treatment of infants born to colonized mothers are clinical symptoms, gestational age, additional risk factors (such as premature rupture of membranes or maternal fever) and intrapartum antibiotics. Postnatal antibiotic prophylaxis and laboratory screens failed the test of controlled trials. Transfer to a neonatology unit is recommended for symptomatic term and all preterm infants. Asymptomatic term infants should be carefully monitored during the first 48 hours for signs of respiratory, circulatory or thermoregulatory compromise. VARICELLA: In the case of maternal varicella near term, delaying delivery for one week will lower the risk of severe neonatal varicella. The postnatal administration of varicella-zoster-immunoglobulin to the neonate is supported by some (if limited) evidence from the literature in the case of maternal eruption between 7 days before and 2 days after delivery. In newborns of mothers with eruption appearing later immunoglobulin is often recommended, though no supporting clinical evidence is available. There are no data to justify the use of immunoglobulin after exposure during pregnancy in order to prevent pneumonia in the pregnant patient, but there are preliminary indications that its application could lower the risk of congenital varicella syndrome (2% between 13 and 20 weeks). The use of immunoglobulin in very low birth weight infants after nosocomial exposure is generally recommended but efficacy data are lacking. TOXOPLASMOSIS: The practical approach depends on clinical findings in the newborn and laboratory results during pregnancy and after birth. Examination of the newborn should include fundoscopy, cranial sonography and, in cases of documented infection, lumbar puncture. Serology from cord blood comprises assays for IgG, IgM and if possible IgA/IgE. If available, demonstration of the parasite by culture or PCR can be helpful. All infants with documented congenital toxoplasmosis should be treated for a minimum of 12 months. In the case of suspected toxoplasmosis the child should be treated as long as the suspicion persists. The prognosis after consequential therapy is less bleak than previously reported for untreated children even in seriously symptomatic patients."

Parasite DNA detection established the presence of a high rate of infection in newborns (13.6%), a low level of infection from two to 26 weeks (1.5-9.7%) and a steadily increasing parasite rate from 26 weeks of age. The median age to first infection was 42 weeks. Five cases of fever (temperature > or = 37.5 degrees C) and parasite density greater than 1,000 parasites/microl of blood, all in children more than 18 weeks of age, were considered possible cases of clinical malaria. The risk of infection was almost three times higher in the wet season than in the dry season and increased significantly from the age of 18 weeks. The level of malaria-specific IgG at birth was positively correlated with risk of infection in children 6-12 months of age, indicating that maternally derived anti-malarial IgG is correlated with exposure to malaria infection. There was no association between malaria-specific IgG at birth and risk of infection in children 0-6 months of age. However, infants do appear to possess mechanisms to limit parasite growth and a role for maternal antibody cannot be ruled out."

Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (m-RT-PCR) is a sensitive, specific, and rapid method for detecting several DNA and RNA viruses in a single specimen. We developed a m-RT-PCR assay that utilizes multiple virus-specific primer pairs in a single reaction mix combined with an enzyme-linked amplicon hybridization assay (ELAHA) using virus-specific probes targeting unique gene sequences for each virus. Using this m-RT-PCR-ELAHA, we examined the presence of seven respiratory viruses in 598 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples from patients with suspected respiratory infection. The specificity of each assay was 100%. The sensitivity of the DFA was 79.7% and the combined DFA/culture amplified-DFA (CA-DFA) was 88.6% when compared to the m-RT-PCR-ELAHA. Of the 598 NPA specimens screened by m-RT-PCR-ELAHA, 3% were positive for adenovirus (ADV), 2% for influenza A (Flu A) virus, 0.3% for influenza B (Flu B) virus, 1% for parainfluenza type 1 virus (PIV1), 1% for parainfluenza type 2 virus (PIV2), 5.5% for parainfluenza type 3 virus (PIV3), and 21% for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The enhanced sensitivity, specificity, rapid result turnaround time and reduced expense of the m-RT-PCR-ELAHA compared to DFA and CA-DFA, suggests that this assay would be a significant improvement over traditional assays for the detection of respiratory viruses in a clinical laboratory."

We conducted a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study in children with influenza virus infection ranging in age from ≥28 days to <16 years during the 2009 pandemic A (H1N1) influenza epidemic to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of peramivir in children after intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg (600 mg maximum) once daily. Among the 106 children (125 days to 15 years old) confirmed to have been infected with the pH1N1 virus by the PCR who were treated with peramivir, the median time to alleviation of symptoms was 29.1 h (95% confidence interval = 22.1 to 32.4), and the proportion of the 106 children who were virus positive was 78.2% on day 2 after the start of treatment and had decreased to 7.1% on day 6. The results of the safety evaluation among 117 patients enrolled in this study showed that adverse events and adverse drug reactions were reported in 62.4 and 29.1%, respectively, of the patients. All of the adverse events and adverse drug reactions resolved or improved rapidly. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the basis of 297 observed plasma concentration data obtained from 115 children with influenza virus infection. Peramivir exposure in children was within the range of levels within which the efficacy and safety was confirmed in adults, and it is considered that peramivir is clinically and virologically effective and safe in children with pH1N1 virus infection."

CD011926,0,9523400,0,Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections.,"Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is one of the life-threatening infections of newborns. It affects approximately 1,500 to 2,200 infants per year in the United States. Changes in the presentation of neonatal HSV infection over the past two decades include an increase in the frequency of skin, eye, and mouth (SEM) disease with a relatively unchanged rate of central nervous system (CNS) disease, but a relative decline in disseminated infection. Although the mortality of neonatal HSV infections has declined with current antiviral therapy, the mortality rate in CNS disease (15%) and disseminated disease (57%) remains high. Morbidity has been seen most frequently in infants with CNS and disseminated disease, with seizures or infection with HSV-2 determined to be risk factors for poor outcome in survivors. In a multicenter, randomized, blinded study by the Collaborative Antiviral Study Group, no differences in outcome were seen between neonates treated with vidarabine and acyclovir. More recently, administration of oral acyclovir has been demonstrated to prevent cutaneous recurrences of HSV after neonatal SEM disease. Although promising, this investigational protocol requires further evaluation before a routine recommendation for prophylactic therapy with oral acyclovir can be made. The application of polymerase chain reaction to rapid diagnosis of neonatal HSV disease may provide additional information on which clinical decisions may be based, but its diagnostic utility outside the research setting is still unproven. Further clinical trials for prophylaxis of recurrent SEM disease, prophylactic therapy for the prevention of recurrences of CNS or disseminated disease, the appropriate use of rapid diagnostic testing, and future therapies that may include passive antibody plus antiviral therapy or higher dosage and longer duration of antiviral therapy need to be evaluated."

CD011926,0,16493335,0,[Natural history of hepatitis B infection].,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted by parenteral, sexual and perinatal routes. While fulminant hepatitis may occur in 1% of cases of symptomatic acute hepatitis, the principal problem of HBV infection is that it may become chronic, classically defined by carriage of HB surface antigens (HBsAg) for more than 6 months. This occurs in only 0.5 to 3% of immunocompetent adults but more frequently in children (up to 90%) and in immune-compromised patients (30 to 100%). The course of chronic HBV infection is characterized by variations in viral replication with spontaneous reactivation or discontinuation, and potential exacerbations observed clinically or by laboratory testing. The pathogenesis of HBV infection is mainly immune-mediated, resulting from host-virus interactions but also from the complexity of the virus itself (integration, mutation, occult replication). These factors explain the variety of presentations of chronic HBV infection, which range from immune tolerance to inactive carriage of HBsAg, passing through a stage of immune clearance, where chronic active hepatitis which may lead to cirrhosis (yearly incidence of 1.3 to 5.9%). Cirrhosis may be complicated by portal hypertension, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma, which together explain 80% of the morbidity and mortality associated with HBV. The 5-year survival rate for HBV-related cirrhosis ranges from 52 to 82%. Immunosuppression, hepatitis D virus superinfection, and chronic alcohol consumption are the principal factors that modify this natural history. Chronic HBV infection is a major public health problem, particularly in developing countries, and it requires that efforts to make HBV vaccination universal be intensified."

Two other HCoV (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) have been known for 30 years. HCoV-229E has been recently involved in nosocomial respiratory viral infections in high-risk children. However, their diagnosis is not routinely performed. Currently, reliable immunofluorescence and cell culture methodologies are not available. As part of a four-year epidemiological study in a Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive care unit, we have performed and demonstrated the reliability of a reverse transcription-PCR-hybridization assay to detect HCoV of the 229E antigenic group in 2028 clinical respiratory specimens. In hospitalized children (children and newborns) and staff members we found a high incidence of HcoV-229E infection. This reverse transcription-PCR-hybridization assay gave a high specificity and a sensitivity of 0.5 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose per ml.

We investigated a nosocomial infection caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Korea. A. baumannii isolates were characterized using Etest (AB Biodisk, Sweden), two multiplex PCR assays, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. PCR and PCR mapping experiments were performed for detecting and characterizing the determinants of antimicrobial resistance. Eight strains isolated from an NICU belonged to European (EU) clone II and revealed only one sequence type (ST), namely, ST357. All the isolates were susceptible to imipenem but were resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a nosocomial infection in an NICU in Korea caused by ST357 MDR/carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii strains. This result demonstrates that nosocomial outbreaks of MDR/carbapenem-susceptible strains as well as MDR/carbapenem-resistant isolates may occur in NICUs."
CD011926,0,24184085,0,Development of a novel single tube nested PCR for enhanced detection of cytomegalovirus DNA from dried blood spots.,"Newborn screening for congenital cytomegalovirus (CCMV) using dried blood spots (DBS) has been proposed because many developed countries have DBS screening programmes in place for other diseases. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid, single tube nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for enhanced detection of CMV from DBS compared to existing (single target) real time PCRs. The new method was compared with existing real time PCRs for sensitivity and specificity. Overall sensitivity of the single target PCR assays in both asymptomatic and symptomatic infants with laboratory confirmed congenital CMV was 69% (CMV PCR or culture positive before day 21 of life). In contrast, the single tube nested assay had an increased sensitivity of 81% with100% specificity. Overall the assay detected CMV from a DBS equivalent to an original blood sample which contained 500IU/ml. In conclusion this single tube nested methodology allows simultaneous amplification and detection of CMV DNA in 1.5h removing the associated contamination risk of a two step nested PCR. Owing to its increased sensitivity, it has the potential to be used as a screening assay and ultimately allow early identification and intervention for children with congenital CMV."

Seven patients of the intermediate care unit were affected. Isolates of Escherichia coli O18ac:H31 that were non-lactose and -sorbitol fermenting were recovered from outbreak cases. Although the strains were negative for a number of virulence factors typically found in diarrheagenic groups of E. coli, all isolates from the present neonatal outbreak possessed the enterohemolysin gene, ehl1. All isolates showed resistance to the antibiotics ampicillin and chloramphenicol. These isolates showed a low adherence property in HeLa cells without any recognizable pattern. In order to evaluate the outbreak dissemination in the neonatology ward, a prevalence study was conducted on 13 November. Stool specimens were obtained from 16 neonates hospitalized in the sector and from 33 medical staff members. E. coli isolates with identical biochemical characteristics of the outbreak strain were recovered from 11 of 16 inpatients and from 4 of 33 staff members during the prevalence study. A total of 15 E. coli strains recovered both from the outbreak and the prevalence study were processed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). By RAPD-PCR 14 of 15 strains showed patterns with 85 to 100% similarity, and by PFGE these strains were identical, each showing a unique pattern with 15 bands between 40 and 400 kb. One strain isolated from a nurse during the prevalence study presented a pattern not related to the others, and this was characterized as E. coli O81:HNM resistant to ampicillin only and negative for all the virulence factors studied. This outbreak occurred despite strict regulations in place to prevent cross-infection in the hospital. Postoutbreak prevalence studies were performed weekly thereafter without detecting new cases."

This study examined the genetic relationship between bovine and human serotype III GBS by using molecular techniques that classify human serotype III GBS into four distinct phylogenetic lineages. Bovine serotype III GBS were largely contained in two lineages, which are distinct from the two major lineages (restriction digest types III-2 and III-3) that infect human neonates. One of the bovine lineages closely resembles the human III-1 lineage, whose members occasionally cause human neonatal infections. The bovine strains in the other lineage characteristically have an initiation factor IF2 gene (infB) H allele and multilocus sequence types that are not found in human GBS strains. Evidence suggests that this ""H allele"" lineage is related to the human III-3 lineage. These results support the assertion that human and bovine GBS are largely unrelated and provide further insight into the genetic relation between human and bovine GBS."

CD011926,0,7716454,0,[Current diagnostic aspects of toxoplasmosis].,"Biological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is now based more widely on combined use of serology and techniques for detection of the parasite or its constituents. Serologic methods endeavour to describe more reliably the antibodies involved in the humoral response and define their specific antigenic properties. Use of purified parasite proteins and characterization of isotypes having short-lived kinetics now make it possible to be more precise about the date of contamination in the case of first infections; however, serology remains of limited interest for diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in immunodepressed patients. Techniques for detection of the parasite by cell culture, or of parasite DNA by polymerase chain reaction, now represent the alternatives of choice to direct search or animal inoculation. These techniques are more specifically indicated where the immune response is abnormal or absent, particularly in immunodepressed patients and in the fetus. The results, obtained in a few days, provide a reliable diagnosis and enable specific treatment to be instituted."
CD011926,0,24972365,0,Development of an improved RT-LAMP assay for detection of currently circulating rubella viruses.,"Rubella virus is the causative agent of rubella. The symptoms are usually mild, and characterized by a maculopapular rash and fever. However, rubella infection in pregnant women sometimes can result in the birth of infants with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Global efforts have been made to reduce and eliminate CRS. Although a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection of rubella virus has been reported, the primers contained several mismatched nucleotides with the genomes of currently circulating rubella virus strains. In the present study, a new RT-LAMP assay was established. The detection limit of this assay was 100-1000PFU/reaction of viruses for all rubella genotypes, except for genotype 2C, which is not commonly found in the current era. Therefore, the new RT-LAMP assay can successfully detect all current rubella virus genotypes, and does not require sophisticated devices like TaqMan real-time PCR systems. This assay should be a useful assay for laboratory diagnosis of rubella and CRS."

Specific diagnostic tools were applied for the first time in a Tunisian prospective study in order to get a first estimation of the prevalence of Bordetella pertussis/parapertussis infections and to evaluate their use to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of these infections in Tunisian infants. Between 2007 and 2011, a total of 626 samples from 599 infants aged <1 year with and without pertussoid cough were investigated for the presence of B. pertussis/parapertussis using culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The real-time PCR (RT-PCR) targets include IS481 commonly found in B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica, and B. holmesii; IS1001 specific of B. parapertussis, in combination with the pertussis toxin promoter region gene (ptx) of B. pertussis; and the recA gene specific of B. holmesii. When possible, patients' household contacts provided nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) for RT-PCR detection of B. pertussis/parapertussis or single-serum samples for anti-PT IgG quantification. All except 1 NPAs were negative by conventional culture, whereas PCR gave positive signals for 126 specimens (21%): B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, and Bordetella spp. were detected in 82%, 6%, and 4% of the samples, respectively. The simultaneous presence of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis was noted in 8% of the cases. Pertussis was reported throughout the year with a peak during the summer of the year 2009. The prevalence of Bordetella infection was 20% between 2007 and 2011. Most of these cases corresponded to patients younger than 6 months who received <3 doses of pertussis vaccine. Among the household contacts enrolled in the study, mothers seemed to be the likely source of infection. This study showed that pertussis is still prevalent in Tunisia and that the disease remains a public health problem affecting not only infants but also adults. Given this situation, sensitive and specific laboratory tests are needed to improve the accuracy of pertussis diagnosis."
CD011926,0,7477021,0,Detection of cytomegalovirus using 'boosted' nested PCR.,"As a part of a study of an outbreak of CMV infections in a neonatal care intensive care unit, a modified nested PCR was developed for detection of CMV DNA in clinical specimens. Standard nested PCR involves a critical step; passage of PCR products from the first reaction round to the second round. We have adapted a 'boosted' nested PCR which implies amplification in one single step, thus reducing the contamination problems. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and urine samples from patients with perinatal CMV infections, breast milk from some of their mothers, amniotic fluids, urine samples and lymphocytes from seropositive healthy adults were examined by PCR and culture. In the total of 614 of clinical specimens, the PCR test yielded positive results in 51 samples from 14 patients, whereas CMV was isolated in 25 samples from 11 cases only. All samples from healthy individuals were negative. CMV DNA was detected in all culture-positive samples, but all samples from healthy adults were negative. 29/68 culture negative specimens were positive by PCR. No cross-reactivity to other herpes viruses or to human DNA was observed. Our findings show a high sensitivity and a high specificity of the 'boosted' nested PCR. We conclude that the described PCR method can be used for the rapid detection of CMV in clinical specimens with a greatly reduced risk of contamination, and it has proved to be a very useful tool in diagnostic work."

The globally uncommon G4P[6] type was the most prevalent type identified among strains (27% of strains), the newly emerging G9P[8] strain accounted for 11% of strains, and the globally common genotypes (i.e., G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G4P[8]) constituted 55% of the strains characterized. Ninety percent of G4P[6] strains were detected in specimens obtained from neonates. Common genotypes were responsible for the rotavirus epidemic that began in January 2003 and ended in May 2003; however, an early peak in infections with the G4P[6] strain occurred from August through October 2002, and infections with this strain were detected throughout the remaining study period. G4P[6] strains were most commonly identified at 6 urban health care centers, but they were absent from 2 rural health care centers. The newly emerging strain G9P[8] represented a relatively greater proportion of strains identified at a hospital in the central region of Korea and at 2 hospitals in the southern region.

CD011926,0,24690382,0,Pediatric parechovirus infections.,"Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are members of the large and growing family of Picornaviridae. Although 16 types have been described on the basis of the phylogenetic analyses of the VP1 encoding region, the majority of published reports relate to the HPeV types 1-8. In pediatrics, HPeV1, HPeV2 and HPeV4-8 mainly cause mild gastrointestinal or respiratory illness; only occasionally more serious diseases have been reported, including myocarditis, encephalitis, pneumonia, meningitis, flaccid paralysis, Reye syndrome and fatal neonatal infection. In contrast, HPeV3 causes severe illness in young infants, including sepsis and conditions involving the central nervous system. Currently, the most sensitive method for detecting HPeV is real-time polymerase chain reaction assays on stools, respiratory swabs, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. However, although it is known that HPeVs play a significant role in various severe pediatric infectious diseases, diagnostic assays are not routinely available in clinical practice and the involvement of HPeV is therefore substantially underestimated. Despite long-term efforts, the development of antiviral therapy against HPeVs is limited; no antiviral medication is available and the use of monoclonal antibodies is still being evaluated. More research is therefore needed to clarify the specific characteristics of this relevant group of viruses and to develop appropriate treatment strategies."

CD011926,0,24136657,0,Irreproducible positive results on the Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 Qual test are different qualitatively from confirmed positive results.,"Criteria that define low positive results on the COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan (CAP/CTM) HIV-1 Qual test as inconclusive have been adopted by all academic centres in South Africa that conduct infant HIV PCR, following previous investigations that showed poor specificity of these results. Retesting all inconclusive specimens has considerable cost implications. Therefore, it was attempted to characterise such inconclusive results, by comparing those that prove to be either negative or positive on follow-up testing. This retrospective, laboratory-based study found that 193 of 211 (91.5%) patients with previous inconclusive results (defined as reported positive by CAP/CTM but with cycle threshold [Ct ] values of >32 and/or fluorescence intensity [FI] values of <5) tested negative and only 18 (8.5%) tested positive using independently obtained follow-up samples after a median of 28 days. The only significant independent predictor of a later positive result was a higher FI value (3.326 vs. 0.495, P < 0.0001), whereas Ct values were not predictive independently. Specimens from patients negative on follow-up testing differed qualitatively from specimens that proved to be true positives. As the lower FI values in false-positive compared to true-positive results probably are indicative of a non-specific signal, the incorporation of stringent amplification slope criteria in the assay's test definition file may improve correct classification and thus reduce the need for repeat testing of a large number of inconclusive specimens."

CD011926,0,14515448,0,[Congenital cytomegalovirus infection].,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) belongs to the herpesvirus family. Its distribution is ubiquitous in man and many other mammals. CMV causes a typical cytopathic effect with enlargement of the cells that contain intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions. CMV is spread directly or by a contact with secretions. Nosocomial transmission can occur during blood transfusion or organ transplantation. Virus excretion after infection continues for a long time. CMV is the most frequent cause of congenital infections (1-2% children). A foetal infection can lead to a preterm labour. Most of CMV congenital infections are benign, only a small proportion of children develop a disease with sensorineural hearing loss or a life threatening multiorgan disease. The diagnosis can be done on the basis of identification of specific antibodies, virus cultivation and PCR from urine, saliva, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. An antiviral drug ganciclovir can be used for treatment. Anti-CMV vaccines are under the development. Three cases of a congenital CMV infection are described in the paper."

E. coli isolates were analysed with specific gene probes for localised adhesiveness (LA), diffuse adhesiveness (DA), heat-labile toxin (LT), heat-stable toxin (ST), Shiga-like toxins (SLT I and SLT II), and enteroinvasiveness, and in bioassays for production of enterotoxins and cytotoxins, and for cell adherence. With 1136 isolates from 387 patients, there was general agreement between the two assay methods. When there was disparity, gene-probe-positive isolates gave negative results in the corresponding bioassay. In the HeLa cell adherence assay, 94% of the LA probe-positive isolates and 91.6% of the DA probe-positive isolates gave positive bioassay results for LA and DA respectively. Thirty-six of 39 LT probe-positive isolates and 73 of 86 ST probe-positive isolates gave positive results in the bioassays. Of 28 isolates that gave negative results in the suckling mouse assay but were initially positive with the probe for ST, 15 were later found to hybridize with the cloning vector for the ST probe. Addition of denatured vector DNA at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml in the hybridisation solution eliminated these false positive results. None of the other probe-positive isolates hybridised with any of the cloning vectors used. The DNA hybridisation assay appeared to be a convenient alternative to bioassays for screening large numbers of isolates in epidemiological investigation."
CD011926,0,9534272,0,[Current developments in the laboratory diagnosis of rubella].,"Thirty years after the introduction of the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI), laboratory diagnosis of rubella virus infection has achieved a high reliability. While the HAI remains the reference standard against which newer assays are compared, routine laboratory diagnosis is based mainly on ELISA tests which permit a more rapid and less cumbersome detection of specific IgG and IgM antibody. Although quantification of immunoglobulin G against rubella virus is performed using WHO standards, the correlation between different ELISAs is relatively poor. Despite substantial improvements in virus isolation and nucleic acid amplification techniques, serology remains the mainstay of diagnosis for both acquired and postnatal diagnosis of congenital infection. Differentiation between primary and re-infection is of critical importance during pregnancy and can be achieved relatively reliably by antibody avidity determination or by immunoblot. While current anti-rubella IgM ELISAs are relatively sensitive, their specificity may be limited by cross reactivity with other viruses, i.e. parvovirus B19 and Epstein-Barr virus. Maternal reinfection with congenital rubella syndrome is very rare, however it may be misdiagnosed in the absence of significant IgG antibody titer change and/or IgM antibody."

Twenty-nine samples were analyzed by three methods. Each sample was histologically examined for viral nuclear inclusions in fetal organs and placenta, then immunohistochemical study using Parvovirus B19 antibody that recognized the VP2 protein of the Parvovirus B19 capsid was done in tissue embedded in paraffin (lungs, liver, thymus, kidneys, heart and placenta). Nested-PCR analysis was done after DNA extraction from paraffin blocks and using specific primers of the Parvovirus B19 VP1 gene. Apparent causes of hydrops were eliminated such as metabolic diseases, cardiac failure or malformation. The standard histological study objects viral inclusion in one case (lung tissue). However, the immunohistochemical study was negative in all cases. Nested-PCR demonstrates the presence of the viral DNA in five cases. Our study demonstrates that the implication of Parvovirus B19 in hydrops fetalis must be affirmed by the use of more than one method. Nested-PCR is the most sensitive method in our study and can be easily used for the detection of Parvovirus B19 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues."

Active detection and isolation (ADI) programs aim to reduce transmission. We describe a comprehensive analysis of the clinical and molecular epidemiology of MRSA in an NICU between 2003 and 2013, in the decade following the implementation of an MRSA ADI program. Molecular analyses included strain typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, mec and accessory gene regulator group genotyping by multiplex PCR, and identification of toxin and potential virulence factor genes via PCR-based assays. Of 8,387 neonates, 115 (1.4%) had MRSA colonization and/or infection. The MRSA colonization rate declined significantly during the study period from 2.2 to 0.5/1,000 patient days (linear time, P = 0.0003; quadratic time, P = 0.006). There were 19 cases of MRSA infection (16.5%). Few epidemiologic or clinical differences were identified between MRSA-colonized and MRSA-infected infants. Thirty-one different strains of MRSA were identified with a shift from hospital-associated to combined hospital- and community-associated strains over time. Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive USA300 strains caused 5 of the last 11 infections. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types II and IVa and agr groups 1 and 2 were most predominant. One isolate possessed the gene for toxic shock syndrome toxin; none had genes for exfoliative toxin A or B. These results highlight recent trends in MRSA colonization and infection and the corresponding changes in molecular epidemiology. Continued vigilance for this invasive pathogen remains critical, and specific attention to the unique host, the neonate, and the distinct environment, the NICU, is imperative."

A total of 363 nasopharyngeal mucus samples were collected from children aged 0 to 6 years attending two DCCs in the summer of 2004 (n = 184) and the following winter (n = 179). We obtained 172 H. influenzae isolates and analyzed them by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR for bla(TEM-1) and the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) gene, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The overall carriage rate was 47.4% (172/363), and 37.2% of the isolates (64/172) were ampicillin (AMP) resistant. All the resistant isolates had a PBP mutation(s), while only three isolates had TEM-1. The carriage rate was significantly higher in the winter than in the summer (56.4% and 38.6%, respectively), owing to the increase in the numbers of AMP-susceptible H. influenzae isolates in the winter. Children aged < or = 3 years showed a higher rate of carriage of H. influenzae isolates with an AMP resistance gene(s) than those aged > or = 4 years (21.9% and 12.6%, respectively). Forty-two strains with different PFGE patterns were obtained from among the 172 isolates. Only five strains were observed in both seasons. None of the strains isolated in the summer was isolated from the same carrier in the winter. Twenty-seven strains (64.3%) were isolated from two or more children, and 25 of these were each isolated from children belonging to the same DCC. These results indicate the spread of H. influenzae, particularly those with a PBP mutation(s), and the highly vigorous genetic turnover and substantial horizontal transmission of this pathogen in healthy children attending DCCs in Japan."

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected for detection of common respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Detection and codetection frequencies and clinical features and severity were compared.Of the 3181 hospitalized children, 2375 (74.7%) were detected with ≥1 virus and 707 (22.2%) with ≥1 bacteria, 901 (28.3%) with ≥2 viruses, 57 (1.8%) with ≥2 bacteria, and 542 (17.0%) with both virus and bacteria. The most frequently detected were Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus. Clinical characteristics were similar among different pathogen infections for older group (≥6 years old), with some significant difference for the younger. Cases with any codetection were more likely to present with fever; those with ≥2 virus detections had higher prevalence of cough; cases with virus and bacteria codetection were more likely to have cough and sputum. No significant difference in the risk of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and intensive care unit admission were found for any codetection than monodetection.There was a high codetection rate of common respiratory pathogens among hospitalized pediatric ARI cases, with fever as a significant predictor.

Laboratory findings disclosed pancytopenia and extremely elevated serum LDH and ferritin levels. Coagulation tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 levels were high, but serum interferon-gamma was below the detectable limit. Reactive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was diagnosed on the basis of a high titer of IgG antibodies to the EBV capsid antigen and early antigen. EBV was demonstrated in the peripheral blood and bone marrow cells by polymerase chain reaction. Mature histiocytosis and hemophagocytosis were detected in the bone marrow. A diagnosis of EBV-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (EBV-AHS) was made. Neither prednisolone (PSL 30 mg/day, P.O.) nor methylprednisolone (m-PSL) pulse therapy (1,000 mg/day for 3 days) induced a response. Thereafter, treatment with m-PSL pulse therapy (1,000 mg/day for 3 days) and i.v. administrations of high-dose immunoglobulin (20 g/day for 3 days) in combination with acyclovir (750 mg/day) and gabexate mesilate (2 g/day) induced remission of the disease. Maintenance therapy consisted of PSL (5 mg/day, P.O.) and camostat mesilate (600 mg/day, P.O.). The patient delivered a healthy male infant in the 35th week of pregnancy via natural birth. Reports of pregnant women with EBV-AHS are rare, and the choice of therapy has not yet been established. The present case study suggested the above combination treatment is useful and safe, and capable of changing the fulminant course of EBV-AHS during pregnancy without the use of anticancer drugs."

In total, faecal samples from 13.9% of 165 volunteers and 36.1% of 416 swabs from the regional microbiology hospital laboratory were positive for stx genes after screening by PCR. Isolation of STEC and of E. coli O157 from stx-positive faecal samples was performed by a filter-hybridization protocol and by automated immunomagnetic separation, respectively, and isolates were further characterized by serotyping, virulence typing by PCR and toxin production by the Vero cell assay. STEC were isolated from two samples only, an O146:H21 isolate from one of the volunteers and an O157:H7 isolate from a human case of diarrhoea. To conclude; the results show that it is not unusual to detect stx genes in faecal samples from humans in Norway, both from asymptomatic people and from people with gastrointestinal illness. This finding emphasizes the importance of correct diagnostic criteria for interpretation of the finding of an occasional stx-positive sample or an STEC isolate when searching for an aetiological agent of human cases of diarrhoea."

Molecular diagnostic assays reduce the number of unconfirmed ARIs compared to serology- or culture-based techniques. Screening of 888 inpatient and outpatient respiratory specimens spanning late autumn through to early spring, 2004, identified the presence of a human coronavirus (HCoV) on 74 occasions (8.3% of all specimens and 26.3% of all respiratory virus detections). Prevalence peaked in August (late winter in the southern hemisphere) when they were detected in 21.9% of specimens tested. HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 comprised 82.4% of all HCoVs detected. Positive specimens were used to develop novel reverse transcriptase real-time PCRs (RT-rtPCRs) for HCoV detection. An objective clinical severity score was assigned to each positive HCoV patient. Severity scores were similar to those from a random selection of young children who were positive for respiratory syncytial virus at a different time but from the same specimen population.

An epidemiological investigation based on phenotyping and genotyping methods was performed. All neonates involved in the outbreak, their mothers and 15 staff members were screened for carriage of Staphylococcus aureus by nasal swabs. Isolated strains were compared with strains cultured from affected skin and purulent conjunctiva of infected newborns. Isolates were analyzed for the presence of the etA and etB genes using polymerase chain reaction and genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and coa gene polymorphism. The analyzed S. aureus strains were methicillin-sensitive and could be divided into two groups according to antibiotyping, phage typing, coa polymorphism and PFGE pattern. The first group consisted of etA and etB negative strains, and the second one involved only the etB positive ones. Our results have shown that there were two different clusters of infection caused by two populations of S. aureus strains. Among the 15 medical staff members screened we have found seven carriers. However, phage typing revealed that distinct strains unrelated to the outbreak isolates were carried. Although we have not been able to establish the source of bacteria involved in the outbreak, our results suggest that for both groups, mothers could be the source of the infecting strains."

Such postulated in vivo genetic transfer events are likely to occur at anatomical sites such as the normal nasal mucosa, which is known to be colonized by both CoNS and coagulase positive staphylococci. In this study, we characterized S. aureus and CoNS strains colonizing the anterior nares of 67 patients in Denmark. A total of 54 patients (80%) were colonized with staphylococci that included nine different species identified by internal transcribed spacer PCR (ITS-PCR) and 16S RNA sequencing. The highest rates of colonization were found for S. epidermidis (58%) and S. aureus (39%). Methicillin resistance was present in S. aureus (53%), S. epidermidis (53%), S. haemolyticus (33%), and S. hominis (62%). Genetic backgrounds were characterized by spa typing for S. aureus and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for CoNS. SCCmec typing showed that SCCmec type IV (2B) was the most common in the entire collection (65%). Carriage of multiple species was detected in 20 patients (30%), 16 of whom were colonized with both S. aureus and S. epidermidis. In two cases, simultaneous carriage of different methicillin resistant species was detected. However, the strains carried different SCCmec types. Additional studies in the same epidemiological settings are warranted to identify interspecific genetic events that involve the acquisition of SCCmec by S. aureus."

The ratio of HIV-1 (EIA) antibody levels in the baby at birth to that in the seropositive mother after the first trimester (sequenstration index SI) was available in 114 of a perinatal cohort of 137 infants. We related this ratio to the HIV infection status of the children by 18 months, HIV-1 DNA PCR and HIV-specific IgA antibody detection at birth, between 3 and 6 months, and morbidity and mortality. Thirty-five of the 137 (26 per cent) children were diagnosed as infected by 18 months. The mean (SD) HIV SI was 1.57 (0.88) in 29 infected and 0.83 (0.42) in 85 uninfected infants (P < 0.0001). Sensitivity and specificity of a threshold SI of 1.27 (mean +/- 2 SD of uninfected group) for the prediction of perinatal HIV-1 infection were 41 and 98 per cent, respectively. The reason for the higher SI in the infected babies is the combination of lower antibody titres in the transmitting mothers with raised levels in the infected babies. A similar analysis of antibody ratios showed no statistical differences for measles and tetanus (P > 0.1) between HIV infected and uninfected groups. There was a tendency to increased morbidity (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.31) and more severe disease in those with higher HIV-1 SI. Three of 17 (18 per cent) peripheral blood samples from infected children at birth were PCR positive; all had SI's above the threshold. Overall sensitivity and specificity of PCR were 85 per cent each. Eleven of the 29 infected children were HIV-1 specific IgA positive at birth; six (64 per cent) of these had an SI > 1.27. This simple SI of HIV-1 EIA antibodies at birth is comparable to elaborate techniques in its power to predict perinatally acquired infection. It may be a cheap, reliable and rapid screening test for vertically transmitted HIV-1 infection."

Following IgG depletion of serum samples, 33/35 (94 per cent) of the infected infants and 3/99 (3 per cent) of the uninfected infants showed positive IgA reactivity. Sensitivity at birth was 24 per cent and improved with age; 82 per cent at 3 months, 87 per cent at 6 months and 94 per cent at 12 months. The overall positive and negative predictive values were 92 and 98 per cent, respectively. An evaluation of IgA and PCR in a subsample of infants indicated a better sensitivity of PCR within 3 months of birth, but IgA detection offered a higher overall sensitivity (87 v. 83 per cent) and specificity (91 v. 85 per cent). No significant difference in IgA level was observed between transmitting mothers and non-transmitting mothers. A moderate correlation existed between IgA level in the infant and the cumulative morbidity score, however a stronger association was observed between high IgA levels in the infected infant and rapid disease progression. The viral specific IgA assay is a simple, reliable and cost-effective diagnostic and prognostic test for perinatal HIV infection in developing countries."

Therefore, the use of restriction endonuclease analysis of chromosomal DNA (REAC) and DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms of rRNA genes (ribotyping) to subtype molecularly GBS isolates associated with human invasive disease was investigated. Chromosomal DNA of selected GBS isolates was initially digested with 24 different restriction enzymes. HhaI gave the best discrimination of hybridization banding patterns (ribotypes) and was used with all study isolates. Ribotyping and REAC differentiated among isolates of the same and different serotypes. Nine ribotype patterns were noted among the 76 isolates studied, including 4 among serotype Ia/c and 4 additional ribotypes among serotype III isolates. Epidemiologically related isolates (e.g., mother-infant or twin-twin pairs) had identical REAC and ribotype patterns. Epidemiologically unrelated isolates with the same ribotype usually had different REAC patterns, suggesting that REAC may be a more sensitive technique for strain differentiation.

Cell lines generated by co-expression of E7 with E6 and/or hTERT (i.e., E6/E7, E7/hTERT, and E6/E7/hTERT) exhibited extra copies of chromosome 20 and specific amplification of the 20q12-ter region, whereas those generated without E7 (i.e., hTERT alone or E6/hTERT) did not. Co-expression of hTERT and a dominant-negative version of cdk4 that has been shown to inactivate the retinoblastoma (pRb) pathway also resulted in 20q amplification. Interestingly, extra copies of chromosome 20 were observed in early passage keratinocytes that expressed E7 alone, and microarray expression analysis revealed that genes in the 20q region and on chromosome 5 were specifically upregulated in these cells. Our results indicate that chromosome 20q amplification is an early event that may be specifically caused by expression of E7 through inactivation of the pRb pathway in human epithelial cells."

In Zambia, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that only detect Plasmodium falciparum are the main confirmatory means for malaria diagnosis in most health facilities without microscopy services. As a consequence of this P. falciparum species diagnostic approach, non-falciparum malaria is not only under-diagnosed but entirely missed, thereby making the exact disease burden unknown. We thus investigated the prevalence of various Plasmodium spp. and associated burden of infection in selected communities in Zambia."

Astrovirus was detected in 16 fecal specimens by Northern (RNA) dot blot analysis of RNA isolated from feces with an astrovirus-specific cDNA probe. The incidence of astrovirus infection was determined as 4.2% (16 of 378 total samples) compared with rates of 63.2, 3.7, and 4.2% for rotavirus, adenovirus, and all bacterial pathogens, respectively. Astrovirus was detected during the winter season and mainly in infants between 6 and 12 months of age. Serotyping of samples was carried out by reverse transcriptase PCR and direct sequencing of a 348-bp region of the capsid protein gene. Type 1 strains predominated (11 of 13 typeable samples), although type 4 isolates were also detected. Astrovirus was retrospectively identified in 13 fecal samples collected from hospitalized infants between 1980 and 1985 and shown to contain small viruses by electron microscopy. Type 1 isolates were again the most common, although a type 5 strain was also found. Comparative sequence analysis indicated that type 1 astroviruses exhibited up to 7% sequence divergence over a 15-year period; however, all mutations were silent. The incidence of astrovirus reported here indicates that the virus is a significant cause of severe diarrhea in young children. The genetic analysis also provides important molecular epidemiological information relevant to the development of preventative therapies."
CD011926,0,20042626,0,The nonserotypeable pneumococcus: phenotypic dynamics in the era of anticapsular vaccines.,"Nonserotypeable pneumococci (NSP) are commonly carried by Australian Indigenous children in remote communities. The purpose of this study was to characterize carriage isolates of NSP from Indigenous children vaccinated with the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and to use these data to guide decisions on reporting of NSP. A total of 182 NSP were characterized by BOX typing, antibiogram analysis, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of common BOX types. NSP positive for the wzg capsule gene were analyzed by a multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot hybridization assay (mPCR/RLB-H) targeting capsule genes to determine the serotype. Among 182 NSP, 49 BOX types were identified. MLST of 10 representative isolates found 7 STs, including ST448 (which accounted for 11% of NSP). Non-penicillin susceptibility was evident in 51% of the isolates. Pneumococcal wzg sequences were detected in only 23 (13%) NSP, including 10 that contained an approximately 1.2-kb insert in the region. mPCR/RLB-H identified serotype 14 wzy sequences in all 10 NSP, and 1 also contained a serotype 3-specific wze sequence. Among the remaining 13 wzg-positive NSP, few belonged to the serotypes represented in PCV7. It appears that most NSP identified in Australian Indigenous children are from a true nonencapsulated lineage. Few NSP represented serotypes in PCV7 that suppress capsular expression. High rates of carriage and penicillin resistance and the occasional presence of capsule genes suggest a role for NSP in the maintenance and survival of capsulated pneumococci. To avoid the inflation of pneumococcal carriage and antibiotic resistance rates, in clinical trials, we recommend separate reporting of rates of capsular strains and NSP and the exclusion of data for NSP from primary analyses."

CD011926,0,12798238,0,Development of a rapid method using nucleic acid sequence-based amplification for the detection of astrovirus.,"We have developed a rapid method to detect astrovirus in fecal specimens utilizing nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and several detection methodologies, including a sandwich hybridization assay based on DNA-tagged liposomes (liposome-strip detection assay). RNA was extracted from 65 stool specimens that were positive for astrovirus by enzyme immunoassay and was amplified by both NASBA and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Also extracted and amplified were 19 specimens containing rotavirus, 20 specimens containing norovirus, five specimens containing adenovirus, 15 water negative control specimens, and eight specimens containing astrovirus reference strains. NASBA products were detected by electrochemiluminescence detection (ECL) and by liposome-strip detection; RT-PCR products were detected by ethidium bromide staining following gel electrophoresis and by liquid hybridization assay (LHA). There was no significant difference in the detection rates of NASBA- and RT-PCR-based assays, with one exception in which the NASBA/ECL assay detected astrovirus in eight specimens that tested negative by the RT-PCR/LHA assay. These results suggest that these NASBA-based detection methods have detection rates that are as good as or better than those of RT-PCR-based methods. Both NASBA and liposome-strip detection may be useful for field studies and environmental testing because these methods are rapid and do not require specialized equipment."

We investigated two outbreaks of febrile illness, in August and November 2012, from Korea district (Chhattisgarh) and Narsinghpur district (Madhya Pradesh), respectively. Fever and entomological surveys were conducted in the affected regions. Molecular and serological tests were conducted on collected serum samples. Dengue-specific amplicons were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed. In Korea and Narsinghpur districts 37·3% and 59% of cases were positive, respectively, for dengue infection, with adults being the worst affected. RT-PCR confirmed dengue virus serotype 1 genotype III as the aetiology. Ninety-six percent of infections were primary. This is the first time that dengue virus 1 outbreaks have been documented from central India. Introduction of the virus into the population and a conducive mosquitogenic environment favouring increased vector density caused the outbreak. Timely diagnosis and strengthening vector control measures are essential to avoid future outbreaks."

For the clinical study, 210 nasal swabs and 134 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract infections in 2013. Three immunochromatographic assay kits (IC-A, IC-B and IC-C), and the RT-PCR method were used for the detection of RSV. The detection times for IC-A, IC-B and IC-C were 8, 15 and 10 minutes, respectively. The positive rates for IC-A using nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates were 33.8% and 35.8%, respectively. For the nasal swab specimens, the total concordance rates of RT-PCR with IC-A, IC-B and IC-C were 96.2% (202/210), 89.5% (188/210), and 90.5% (143/158), respectively. As for the nasopharyngeal aspirates, the total concordance rates of RT-PCR with IC-A, IC-B and IC-C were 96.3% (129/134), 94.0% (125/133), and 97.7% (130/133), respectively. The minimum detection concentration of IC-A was 3.0 x 10(2) TCID50/mL for the RSV subgroup A strain, and 7.5 x 10 TCID50/mL for the RSV subgroup B strain. In conclusion, the current data indicate that IC-A is a useful kit for more rapid and accurate detection of RSV infection."

The aims of WHISTLER are to investigate determinants for wheezing illnesses (including neonatal lung function, viral infections, asthma-susceptibility genes and endotoxin exposure) and to derive a comprehensive risk score, that is appropriate for use in primary health care and allows for efficient planning of early preventive strategies. Baseline examination includes a questionnaire evaluating known risk factors for wheezing illnesses; anthropometric measurements; measurements of infant and parental lung function; and sampling of infant and parental DNA. Participants will be followed for respiratory events using data from a daily respiratory symptom questionnaire; visits to the general practitioner (primary health care visits, drugs prescriptions and hospital referral); viral sampling during wheezing episodes; and house dust sampling. Based on actual neonatal care practice and embedded in a larger epidemiological study, the Utrecht Health Project, WHISTLER will provide an unique framework to address issues in childhood respiratory disease that are currently insufficiently understood. In particular, WHISTLER will provide a well-balanced view on the prognostic power of neonatal lung function and genetic and environmental factors (including viral infections and endotoxin exposure) to predict wheezing illnesses from birth to young adulthood and beyond. In the scope of prevention, WHISTLER is expected to support the design of solid based prevention measures to reduce respiratory morbidity, mortality and associated costs, and to improve quality of life."

The methodology was evaluated by comparison with standard IS6110 typing and by examining its ability to identify known household clusters of cases. Isolates sharing indistinguishable typing patterns using both techniques were defined as clustered. Clusters were investigated to identify epidemiological links. The methodology showed good discriminatory power and identified known household clusters of cases. Of 694 culture-confirmed cases, 563 (81%) were typed. Eleven (2%) were due to laboratory cross-contamination and were excluded. Of the remaining 552 isolates 148 (27%) were clustered. Multivariate analysis indicated that clustering was more common in those with pulmonary smear positive disease (P < 0.02); those born in the United Kingdom (P < 0.0003) and in patients living in south London (P = 0.02). There was also a trend towards clustering being more common in those not known to have HIV infection (P = 0.051).

Detection using PCR with homologous primers was highly specific, as a product with the expected length was consistently amplified with homologous but not with heterologous species. The limit of detection of the PCR assay was 10 color-changing units (CCU) of Mycoplasma strains. The PCR technique facilitated detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum DNA in 31 of 55 patients studied, of Mycoplasma hominis in seven samples, and of Mycoplasma genitalium in two samples. Four PCR-positive patients yielded culture-negative results. In one case a culture-positive sample was negative by PCR.

This study was undertaken to elucidate the contribution of the viral load to the development of disease severity in 412 children ≤3 years of age who were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections. The RV load in nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from the patients at the time of admission was measured by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the clinical symptoms of the patients were assessed using a severity scoring system. Of the 412 patients, 43 (10.4%) were diagnosed with RV infections only, and 15 were determined to have high severity scores. When all patients infected with RV were assessed, there was no correlation between the viral load and the disease severity. However, there was a significant negative correlation between the disease severity and age among children <11 months of age (n = 15, ρ = -0.677, P = 0.006) and a significant positive correlation between the viral load and the disease severity among children ≥11 months of age (n = 28, ρ = 0.407, P = 0.032). Among the patients infected with RV <11 months of age, the disease severity may be associated with an immature immune response and the small diameter of their airways rather than viral load. By contrast, in the patients ≥11 months of age, viral load may contribute to the development of disease severity."

Identical HPV-16 variant URR sequences were found in two mother/infant samples and similar variants were found in three sets. Four mothers with samples which contained prototypic HPV-16 sequences delivered infants who also had the prototypic sequence. Four mothers with variant URRs delivered infants who harboured either prototypic or different URR variants.

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of HAstV infection and to characterize the circulating HAstV strains in children with diarrhea under 3 years of age treated between 1995 and 1998 at out- or in-patient facilities of the children's hospital in Mendoza, Argentina. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were used to detect HAstVs in stool specimens. Positive specimens were tested further by EIA and/or sequenced to type detected HAstV strains. HAstVs were detected in 40 (3.7%) of 1,070 samples that were rotavirus and calicivirus-negative: 14 (3.5%) of 402 from outpatients and 26 (3.9%) of 668 from inpatients. HAstV infection tended to be more severe in children during their first year of life: 18 (4.7%) of 383 HAstV-positive children 0-11 months old were hospitalized versus 8 (2.8%) of 285 children 1 year of age or older (P = 0.29). Type 1 (HAstV-1) was the most common type (41%), followed by HAstV-4 (25%), HAstV-2 (13%), HAstV-3 (13%), and HAstV-5 (8%). In this first epidemiological study of HAstV infection in this region, we confirmed HAstV to be a cause of severe gastroenteritis in children, more often among children younger than 12 months of age.

CD011926,0,22246843,0,High detection frequency and viral loads of human rhinovirus species A to C in fecal samples; diagnostic and clinical implications.,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) can be divided into three species; HRV-A to HRV-C. Up to 148 different HRV (sero)types have been identified to date. Because of sequence similarity between 5'-NCR of HRVs and enteroviruses (EVs), it is problematic to design EV-specific RT-PCR assays. The aims of this study were to assess the rate of false-detection of different rhinoviruses by EV RT-PCR, and to evaluate the diagnostic and clinical significance of such cross-reactivity. In vitro RNA transcripts of HRV A-C created from cDNA templates were quantified spectrophotometrically. Six hundred twenty-one stool samples screened as part of routine diagnostic for EV, 17 EV-positive stool samples referred for typing, 288 stool samples submitted for gastroenteritis investigations, and 1,500 CSF samples were included in the study. EV-specific RT-PCR detected RNA transcripts of HRV-A1b, HRV-B14, and HRV-Crpat18 but with 10-1,000 reduced sensitivity compared to EV transcripts. Screening fecal samples by EV RT-PCR identified 13 positive samples identified subsequently as rhinoviruses; a further 26 HRV-positive samples were identified by nested HRV RT-PCR. All individuals were hospitalized and presented mostly with diarrhea. A total of 26 HRV types were identified (HRV-A: 46%; HRV-B: 13%; HRV-C: 41%). Results confirm that EV-specific RT-PCR can detect HRVs, and at a practical level, identify potential problems of interpretation if fecal samples are used for surrogate screening in cases of suspected viral meningitis. High detection frequencies (10%) and viral loads in stool samples provide evidence for enteric replication of HRV, and its association with enteric disease requires further etiological studies."
CD011926,0,26581026,0,Evaluation of chikungunya virus infection in children from India during 2009-2010: A cross sectional observational study.,"Chikungunya virus, a small (about 60-70 nm diameter), spherical, enveloped, positive, single stranded RNA virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. After a short period of incubation (3-5 days) symptoms like fever with joint pains and others start appearing. After a gap of 20 years, this virus re-emerged during 2006-2008 in India causing a major outbreak of CHIKV in India. This study was conducted subsequent to the major outbreak in order to evaluate the proportion of chikungunya virus infection in children with suggestive symptoms at three geographical locations of India. Lineage of circulating strains and changes in the E1 structural polypeptide were also determined. Blood samples were collected (in Sodium citrate vacutainer tubes) during 1st June 2009 to 31st May 2010 from children (age 0 ≤ 18 years) suspected to have chikungunya infection, that is, those who presented with sudden onset of fever and/or joint pain, myalgia, and headache from three regions of India, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubli and Sawai Mansingh Medical College (SMS) in Jaipur. Detection of CHIKV antibodies in all acute-phase patient plasma samples was done by IgM ELISA and for samples within ≤5 days of fever, a one-step RT-PCR was carried out on a block thermo-cycler targeting 294 bp region of E1 gene that codes for the viral envelope protein. Comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences from few positive samples of two regions was done with African S-27 reference strain using BioEdit. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 6 by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model. Out of the 723 acute phase samples tested from three geographical locations of India, Chikungunya virus infection was detected in 249/723 (34.44%) subjects by either IgM Elisa (180/723) or RT-PCR (69/412). RT-PCR was employed in samples collected from children with ≤5 days of fever. Maximum positive cases were from KIMS center, Hubli. Seasonally, positivity varied with number of enrolled cases at KIMS and SMS. Joint pain was significantly associated with CHIKV positivity (P = 0.0156). Presence/absence of certain clinical features varied with age (P < 0.05). Sequence analysis revealed four amino acid changes. Phylogenetic analysis with partial sequences of E1 gene from KIMS (n = 12) and SMS (n = 5) showed that the study isolates clustered with Indian Ocean Lineage strains (IOL) of East, Central and South African (ECSA) type. Evaluation of chikungunya virus infection in children from India during 2009-2010 showed high proportion of CHIKV infection in Southern region of India compared to Northern region. The circulating CHIKV strains were of Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) group within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) genotype. However few amino acid changes were observed in E1 polypeptide with reference to African strain S-27 (AF369024). Further studies are needed to know the implications of these changes in vector-pathogen compatibility and host-pathogen interactivity. As a whole, this study highlighted the proportion of CHIKV cases, lineage of causative strain and evolutionary pattern of circulating strain in terms of amino acid changes in the structural protein."

An estimated 120 million new cases of pneumonia occur globally each year. In developing countries, management and prevention efforts against pneumonia have traditionally focused on bacterial pathogens. More recently however, viral pathogens have gained attention as a result of improved diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction, outbreaks of severe disease caused by emerging pathogens, discovery of new respiratory viruses as well as the decrease in bacterial pneumonia as a consequence of the introduction of highly effective conjugate vaccines. Although the epidemiology, etiology and clinical characterization of viral infections are being studied extensively in the developed world, little data are available from low- and middle-income countries. In this paper, we review the epidemiology, etiology, clinical and radiological features of viral pneumonia in developing countries."

The correlation between presence of high oncogenic type of HPV and carcinogenesis was confirmed in human anogenital tract and cervical carcinoma. The latest studies suggest HPV infection involvement in benign and malignant lesions of aerodigestive tract. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of the HPV genes E6/E7. The specimens were taken after total laryngectomy from 20 patients with squamous cell carcinoma. The fresh tissue specimens were frozen at -70 degrees C until DNA extraction and HPV detection. The presence of HPV DNA was assessed by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for HPV 16 and 18 E6/E7. There were 7 (35%) HPV positive specimens in our group. 5 (25%) specimens were HPV 16 positive, 4 (20%) specimens were HPV-18 positive. In two cases HPV 16 and HPV 18 was present. The results suggest that high oncogenic types of HPV may play a role in pathogenesis of laryngeal carcinoma."

New York City Perinatal HIV Transmission Collaborative Study.,"Early diagnosis of perinatally transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection can guide early interventions. HIV coculture and DNA polymerase chain reaction (DNA-PCR) detect few HIV-infected infants at birth and 90%-100% by age 3 months. Because extracellular HIV RNA may appear soon after infection, a plasma HIV RNA assay was compared with DNA-PCR for early detection of perinatally infected infants. Blood-draw specimens (108) obtained at the same time from 49 HIV-infected infants and 10 specimens from 8 uninfected infants were tested. HIV RNA and DNA-PCR positivity rates were 56% and 33%, respectively, in 36 specimens from 36 infants <28 days of age (binomial test, P = .001). Among 81 specimens obtained after age 14 days, 79 (98%) were positive by HIV RNA testing. No HIV-infected infant specimens were DNA-PCR-positive and HIV RNA-negative. All specimens from 8 uninfected infants were HIV RNA-negative. These results suggest that plasma HIV RNA was detectable earlier and more reliably than HIV DNA in perinatal infection."
CD011926,0,15879290,0,Monocyte toll-like receptor 4 expression and LPS-induced cytokine production increase during gestational aging.,"Premature newborns are highly susceptible to severe bacterial infections. This is partially due to their immature innate immune system, characterized by decreased neutrophil and monocyte activity as well as by reduced concentrations of complement factors. However, additional mechanisms might be important for innate immunity and are still the subject of considerable debate. The importance of pattern recognition domains such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) has been fully acknowledged within the last few years. Therefore, we investigated age-related monocyte TLR4 expression and lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine secretion from very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) and from newborns after wk 30 of gestation in comparison to healthy adults. In VLBWI, expression of TLR4 surface protein, detected by flow cytometry, and TLR4-specific mRNA, quantified by real time-PCR, were significantly reduced in comparison to mature infants and to adults. Reduced TLR4 expression was paralleled by significantly diminished ex vivo LPS stimulated IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion into whole blood. We conclude that, in VLBWI, the minimized expression of TLR4 contributes to the susceptibility of VLBWI to infections with Gram-negative bacteria due to the lack of cytokines to boost initial immune response."
CD011926,0,8102262,0,The T cell receptor V beta repertoire in HIV-1 infection and disease.,"Viral superantigens (SAg) were shown in mice to induce anergy and deletion of T cells bearing specific T cell receptor V beta subsets, these perturbations being mainly restricted to CD4+ T cells. In accordance with this model, a putative HIV-associated SAg could contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and AIDS. To reveal the presence of this putative molecule, three study protocols were designed that relied on the fact that similarity of the expressed V beta repertoire of a given pair of individuals is proportional to the relative likeness of their MHC background: (1) by using a quantitative PCR technique that allows simultaneous typing of 24 V beta families, the V beta repertoires of HIV-discordant monozygotic twins were compared; (2) the V beta repertoire found in lymph nodes of HIV-infected subjects was contrasted to that found in peripheral blood of the same individuals; (3) the V beta repertoire of a cohort of HIV-infected mothers was compared with that of their HIV-infected and uninfected children. Results from these approaches revealed that significant perturbations of the TCR V beta repertoire were taking place in HIV-infected subjects, and that these alterations were restricted to T cells expressing specific V beta s. These results are consistent with the presence of an HIV-associated SAg in HIV-1 infection."

All 86 isolates were genotyped by infrequent-restriction-site polymerase chain reaction (IRS-PCR) and electrophoretic karyotyping (EK) with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 15 genotypes were identified by IRS-PCR and 12 genotypes by EK. Some infants shared a common genotype. From a single infant, an identical genotype was found in 11 of 13 cases where at least two isolates of same Candida species were available for genotyping analysis, regardless of anatomical site, how many isolates were recovered or how many times. Should an infant harbour a candidal strain, they may harbour this strain at multiple sites and for a prolonged period."

Meaningful rises of serum IgG-antibody titers by ELISA occurred in three cases. Serum interferon (IFN)-gamma activity was detected in all six cases. Serum cell free soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) activity rose above the normal range (145-519 U/ml) in one IgG and IgM antibody-positive and three IgG antibody-positive woman. Serum levels of sIL-2R and IFN-gamma were not elevated in anti-HCMV antibody-negative healthy pregnant women. No HCMV IE DNA was detected by PCR in the serum of any of the pregnant women. HCMV DNA was detected in the serum of one of six infants with asymptomatic congenital HCMV infection. Assessment of the changes of serum cytokines such as sIL-2R and IFN-gamma in HCMV antibody-positive pregnant women may be useful for the prenatal diagnosis of active HCMV infection during pregnancy.

CD011926,0,15834884,0,Contrasting patterns of hepatitis C virus infection in two regions from Tunisia.,"This report is a population-based study describing the pattern of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in two distinct regions in Tunisia. The study included a total of 11,507 individuals sampled in 1996 from both genders, all age groups, urban and rural settings belonging to 2,973 families. HCV infection was assessed by commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunoblot assays and detection of HCV RNA by PCR. HCV genotypes and subtypes were determined by sequencing in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) viral genomic region and the INNO-LiPA HCVII genotyping kit. Genetic relatedness between HCV strains was assessed by sequencing of a portion of the NS5B region. HCV prevalence was significantly higher in the North-Western region than in the Southern one: 1.7% versus 0.2% (P < 10(-3), chi(2) = 8,506). There was no difference in positivity according to gender or living in rural or urban settings; the only significant risk factor was advanced age. HCV prevalence among household contacts of HCV positives was not significantly higher than the prevalence in the whole study population. These results indicate a heterogeneity in the geographical distribution of HCV in Tunisia. An increased HCV transmission occurs in the North-Western region with large predominance of genotype 1b (88%) and low contribution of intrafamilial transmission."
CD011926,0,22301151,0,Passively transmitted gp41 antibodies in babies born from HIV-1 subtype C-seropositive women: correlation between fine specificity and protection.,"HIV-exposed, uninfected (EUN) babies born to HIV-infected mothers are examples of natural resistance to HIV infection. In this study, we evaluated the titer and neutralizing potential of gp41-specific maternal antibodies and their correlation with HIV transmission in HIV-infected mother-child pairs. Specific gp41-binding and -neutralizing antibodies were determined in a cohort of 74 first-time mother-child pairs, of whom 40 mothers were infected with HIV subtype C. Within the infected mother cohort, 16 babies were born infected and 24 were PCR negative and uninfected at birth (i.e., exposed but uninfected). Thirty-four HIV-uninfected and HIV-unexposed mother-child pairs were included as controls. All HIV-positive mothers and their newborns showed high IgG titers to linear epitopes within the HR1 region and to the membrane-proximal (MPER) domain of gp41; most sera also recognized the disulfide loop immunodominant epitope (IDE). Antibody titers to the gp41 epitopes were significantly lower in nontransmitting mothers (P < 0.01) and in the EUN babies (P < 0.005) than in HIV-positive mother-child pairs. Three domains of gp41, HR1, IDE, and MPER, elicited antibodies that were effectively transmitted to EUN babies. Moreover, in EUN babies, epitopes overlapping the 2F5 epitope (ELDKWAS), but not the 4E10 epitope, were neutralization targets in two out of four viruses tested. Our findings highlight important epitopes in gp41 that appear to be associated with exposure without infection and would be important to consider for vaccine design."

The aim of this study was to determine the frequencies for a large range of respiratory viruses using a sensitive molecular detection technique in specimens from outpatients of all ages with ARIs. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from 162 individuals between August 2007-August 2009. Twenty-three pathogenic respiratory agents, 18 respiratory viruses and five bacteria were investigated using multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF). Through IIF, 33 (20.4%) specimens with respiratory virus were recognised, with influenza virus representing over half of the positive samples. Through a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, 88 (54.3%) positive samples were detected; the most prevalent respiratory viral pathogens were influenza, human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Six cases of viral co-detection were observed, mainly involving RSV. The use of multiplex real-time RT-PCR increased the viral detection by 33.9% and revealed a larger number of respiratory viruses implicated in ARI cases, including the most recently described respiratory viruses [human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and HCoV HKU1]."
CD011926,0,21733031,0,Molecular epidemiology of late recurrent candidaemia--a population-based study in Iceland.,"Candidaemia is associated with high patient mortality. Among those who survive an initial episode of candidaemia, the incidence of recurrent episodes has been incompletely defined. All patients in Iceland with candidaemia in 1980-2008 were identified, and clinical information was reviewed. Episodes of candidaemia in the same patient were considered to be separate if they occurred ≥ 1 month apart or were caused by different Candida species. The isolates were genotyped by using PCR fingerprinting, and antifungal susceptibility was determined. During the 29-year period, candidaemia was diagnosed in 307 patients in Iceland, 298 of whom (97.1%) had a single episode. Overall, 206 patients survived >1 month from the first episode and were therefore at risk of recurrence, yielding 1062 patient-years of observation in the survivors. Of those, nine (4.4%) later developed recurrent candidaemia. The median time between recurrences was 6 months (range, <1 month to 14 years). Patients with late recurrences were younger (p 0.012) and more likely to have underlying gastrointestinal diseases than patients with single episodes (55.6% vs. 18.5%, respectively; p 0.017). The recurrences were caused by identical Candida sp. genotypes in two of 13 cases (15%), but by different species or dissimilar genotypes in eight of 13 (62%); isolates were missing in three cases. In conclusion, late recurrent candidaemia was a relatively rare event, and younger patients with gastrointestinal disorders were more prone to recurrent infections. The majority of late recurrences represented re-infections with new Candida strains that were susceptible to common antifungal agents."

Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis showed good correlation with ribotying. ETs and ribotypes among invasive and carriage isolates were similar. Within different S. pneumoniae serogroups/types, both clonal (7 and 14) and heterogenous (6, 19, and 23) ET and rRNA hybridization patterns were observed. Greatest diversity was observed among serotypes 6A, 6B, and 19F. Use of 12 additional restriction enzymes besides PvuII and BglII did not increase ribotype discrimination within serotype 7 and 14 isolates. Serotype 7 and 14 strains, which appear clonal by subtyping, are rare among carriers but common causes of invasive disease.

CD011926,0,20714004,0,Management of hepatitis C virus infection in childhood.,"Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a worldwide health problem with more than 170 million infected individuals. In children, since 1992 almost all infections occurred through vertical transmission from an infected mother to her newborn infant. Natural history of HCV infection in children is not yet well defined, most children are asymptomatic and may remain so for decades. Most infected individuals (60-80%), regardless of their age at infection, become chronically infected with HCV. Spontaneous resolution in children appears to be infrequent. Positive HCV antibody implicate that patient has been exposed to the virus (EIA test). To discriminate between active or resolved HCV viral infection it is necessary to perform HCV RNA (PCR). Liver biopsy assess degree of liver injury and exclude concurrent diseases. HCV chronic infection is slow progressive in childhood. Progression of fibrosis seems to be a function of infection duration. Treatment objective is clearance of HCVRNA. IFNa is recognized as the drug approved for hepatitis C treatment in pediatric population. Combination therapy with IFNa or pegylated IFNa plus ribavirin is recently approved by US FDA and EMEA and clinical trials are in progress."

CD011926,0,23383205,0,Detection of bocavirus in children suffering from acute respiratory tract infections in Saudi Arabia.,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently discovered in children with respiratory distress and/or diarrhea. To our knowledge, no previous study has reported the existence of bocavirus in Saudi Arabia. Swabs samples from 80 children with respiratory tract infections were examined for the presence of HBoV. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used as a sensitive method to detect the HBoV. Direct gene sequencing was used to determine the genotype of the detected virus isolates. HBoV was detected in 22.5% of the examined patients. The NP1 partial gene sequence from all patients showed that the circulated strains were related to HBoV-1 genotype. Most of HBoV infected patients showed evidence of mixed coinfection with other viral pathogens. The current study clearly demonstrated that genetically conserved HBoV1 circulates in Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, most of the HBoV1 infected cases were associated with high rates of co-infections with other viruses."

Few studies have analysed the diversity of species and types of HAdVs associated with ARI in Brazil. The purpose of this study was to determine the circulation patterns of the different HAdV species and respective types associated with ARI in children in the city of Fortaleza, northeastern Brazil. HAdVs were screened by an indirect immunofluorescence assay, and subsequently identified as species and types by PCR and sequencing of the hexon gene (HVR1-HVR6). Between 2001 and 2013, a total of 290 HAdV strains were detected, 190 of which were identified as belonging to the HAdV-B, -C and -E species. Seven types of HAdVs circulated in the studied population during the analysed period, with HAdV-3 being predominant."

CD011926,0,26215130,0,"Real-time PCR for detection of Strongyloides stercoralis in human stool samples from Côte d'Ivoire: diagnostic accuracy, inter-laboratory comparison and patterns of hookworm co-infection.","Human infections with the helminth species Strongyloides stercoralis encompass a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to life-threatening disease. The diagnosis of S. stercoralis is cumbersome and the sensitivity of conventional stool microscopy is low. New molecular tools have been developed to increase sensitivity. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of real-time PCR with microscopy for the detection of S. stercoralis and hookworm in human stool samples, and investigated the inter-laboratory agreement of S. stercoralis-specific real-time PCR in two European laboratories. Stool specimens from 256 randomly selected individuals in rural Côte d'Ivoire were examined using three microscopic techniques (i.e. Kato-Katz, Koga agar plate (KAP) and Baermann (BM)). Additionally, ethanol-fixed stool aliquots were subjected to molecular diagnosis. The prevalence of S. stercoralis and hookworm infection was 21.9% and 52.0%, respectively, whilst co-infections were detected in 35 (13.7%) participants. The diagnostic agreement between real-time PCR and microscopy was excellent when both KAP and BM tested positive for S. stercoralis, but was considerably lower when only one microscopic technique was positive. The sensitivity of KAP, BM and real-time PCR for detection of S. stercoralis as compared to a combination of all diagnostic techniques was 21.4%, 37.5% and 76.8%, respectively. The inter-laboratory agreement of S. stercoralis-specific PCR was substantial (κ=0.63, p<0.001). We conclude that a combination of real-time PCR and stool microscopy shows high accuracy for S. stercoralis diagnosis. Besides high sensitivity, PCR may also enhance specificity by reducing microscopic misdiagnosis of morphologically similar helminth larvae (i.e. hookworm and S. stercoralis) in settings where both helminth species co-exist."
CD011926,0,11391425,0,TT virus infection in children and adults who visited a general hospital in the south of Brazil for routine procedure.,"TT virus (TTV) is a newly described nonenveloped human virus, with a circular, negative-stranded DNA genome, that was first identified in the blood of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. PCR primers and conditions used for TTV DNA amplification may greatly influence the level of TTV detection in serum. Three PCR assays, with different regions of the genome as targets, were used to test TTV DNA in 130 sera from children and adults visiting a hospital in the south of Brazil, most of them for routine procedure. Forty-four percent of adult sera and 73% of sera from children aged 0-10 years were TTV positive with at least one PCR assay. However, the three assays were able to detect only 33%, 35%, and 70% of the total positive samples. Our results showed a high prevalence of TTV infection in the south of Brazil, particularly among young children, and confirmed the necessity of performing several PCR assays to assess the true TTV prevalence in a determined population."
CD011926,0,19625473,0,New real-time PCR detects prolonged norovirus excretion in highly immunosuppressed patients and children.,"Noroviruses (NoV) are a major cause of epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis and affect all age groups worldwide. Three of five NoV genogroups, namely, genogroup I (GI), GII, and GIV, are associated with human disease. Unfortunately, these genogroups demonstrate a high degree of sequence diversity, complicating the design of pan-NoV diagnostic PCR tests. To decrease the risk of false-negative test results, we have developed a new one-step real-time TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR protocol. This protocol detects all human NoV genogroups in one reaction with a sensitivity of 400 virus genome equivalents/reaction for both GI and GII. The use of in vitro-transcribed NoV RNA as an external standard allows (semi)quantification of viral loads in samples. In a retrospective analysis of 206 stool samples from 77 patient episodes, the duration of NoV excretion and the amount of virus excreted were determined. Twenty (26.0%) of these episodes lasted longer than 10 days. Univariate risk factor analysis revealed the patient status after organ transplantation (odds ratio [OR], 7.49 [95% confidence interval, 2.06 to 28.32]; P < 0.001), immunosuppression (OR, 9.19 [95% confidence interval, 2.50 to 35.39]; P < 0.001), and age of less than 10 years (OR, 4.58 [95% confidence interval, 1.36 to 15.77]; P = 0.004) as risk factors for a NoV excretion period of more than 10 days. These findings were confirmed by time-dependent Kaplan-Meier analyses, whereas multivariate Cox regression analyses identified immunosuppression as the sole risk factor. Surprisingly, in contrast to the excretion periods, the viral loads in stools did not increase in connection with age or immunosuppressive status. This fact may be one important piece in the pattern of high-level NoV transmissibility and may have an impact on the development of transmission prevention strategies."

Infection in childhood involves mother-to-child transmission and transmission between siblings or other close contacts. Large amounts of viral DNA in saliva have been linked to transmission from mother to child.

CD011926,0,17202281,0,Validation of laboratory screening criteria for herpes simplex virus testing of cerebrospinal fluid.,"Most patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) central nervous system (CNS) infection have abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indices. Therefore, we implemented screening criteria based on CSF values and host immune status to guide testing. All CSF samples submitted for HSV PCR analysis from January 1999 through December 2004 were included in the study. Specimens from patients with human immunodeficiency virus, a history of transplants, an age of <2 years, a CSF white blood cell count of >5 cells/mm(3), or a protein level of >50 mg/dl were tested upon request. All other samples were rejected and frozen. To validate our screening criteria, rejected specimens were pooled and tested retrospectively. Electronic medical records were also reviewed. A total of 1,659 HSV PCR requests from 1,458 patients were screened. Of the 1,296 specimens (78.1%) accepted for testing, 1,213 were negative, 7 were positive for HSV type 1 (HSV-1), 26 were positive for HSV-2, and 50 had unavailable results. Sixteen requests were rejected because an alternative microbiologic diagnosis had been established. Of the 347 samples rejected based on criteria, 222 (64.0%) remained available for pooled testing. No HSV-1-positive samples were identified in the rejected specimens. Two rejected specimens tested positive for HSV-2 DNA, but both met acceptance criteria which had not been communicated to the laboratory. Few patients (7.8%) with rejected specimens were treated with acyclovir, which suggests a low clinical concern for HSV encephalitis. Acceptance criteria based on CSF parameters and host immune status saved time and cost and did not miss patients with HSV CNS infection. Communication between the clinician and the laboratory is imperative for a successful screening program."

CD011926,0,9841700,0,Biliary atresia and cytomegalovirus infection: a DNA study.,"The cause of extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) is undetermined in most instances, but an infectious agent is widely suspected. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been associated with intrahepatic bile duct destruction and paucity, raising the question of its role in EHBA. We identified 12 children in the past 5 years with biliary atresia and examined the bile duct biopsy. These showed acute/chronic inflammation and epithelial degeneration. CMV inclusions were not identified. We used in situ hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CMV-DNA on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. All samples showed the presence of amplifiable DNA using beta-globin primers. No biopsy tissue showed CMV DNA using specific probes and primers. The absence of demonstrable CMV DNA by in situ hybridization and PCR in EHBA biopsies implies that it is unlikely that this virus has any major role in the pathogenesis of this condition."
CD011926,0,20186449,0,Heterogeneity of the humoral immune response following Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.,"Expanding knowledge on the humoral immune response in Staphylococcus aureus-infected patients is a mandatory step in the development of vaccines and immunotherapies. Here, we present novel insights into the antibody responses following S. aureus bacteremia. Fifteen bacteremic patients were followed extensively from diagnosis onwards (median 29 days, range 9-74). S. aureus strains (median 3, range 1-6) and serial serum samples (median 16, range 6-27) were collected. Strains were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and genes encoding 19 staphylococcal proteins were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM directed to these proteins were determined using bead-based flow cytometry. All strains isolated from individual patients were PFGE-identical. The genes encoding clumping factor (Clf) A, ClfB, and iron-responsive surface-determinant (Isd) A were detected in all isolates. Antigen-specific IgG levels increased more frequently than IgA or IgM levels. In individual patients, different proteins induced an immune response and the dynamics clearly differed. Anti-ClfB, anti-IsdH, and anti-fibronectin-binding protein A IgG levels increased in 7 of 13 adult patients (p < 0.05). The anti-IsdA IgG level increased in 12 patients (initial to peak level: 1.13-10.72 fold; p < 0.01). Peak level was reached 7-37 days after diagnosis. In a bacteremic 5-day-old newborn, antistaphylococcal IgG levels declined from diagnosis onwards. In conclusion, each bacteremic patient develops a unique immune response directed to different staphylococcal proteins. Therefore, vaccines should be based on multiple components. IsdA is immunogenic and, therefore, produced in nearly all bacteremic patients. This suggests that IsdA might be a useful component of a multivalent staphylococcal vaccine."
CD011926,0,15583291,0,Prevalence and mechanisms of erythromycin resistance in group A and group B Streptococcus: implications for reporting susceptibility results.,"Increased rates of erythromycin resistance among group B Streptococcus (GBS) and group A Streptococcus (GAS) have been reported. Cross-resistance to clindamycin may be present, depending on the mechanism of resistance. We determined the prevalence of macrolide-resistant determinants in GBS and GAS isolates to guide the laboratory reporting of erythromycin and clindamycin susceptibility. Susceptibilities were determined by the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Inducible and constitutive resistance to clindamycin was determined by the double-disk diffusion method. The presence of the ermTR, ermB, and mefA genes was confirmed by PCR. Of the 338 GBS isolates, 55 (17%) were resistant to erythromycin, whereas 26 (8%) were resistant to clindamycin. The erm methylase gene was identified in 48 isolates, 22 of which had inducible resistance to clindamycin and 26 of which had constitutive resistance to clindamycin. The remaining seven resistant isolates had mefA. Of the 593 GAS isolates, 49 (8%) and 6 (1%) isolates were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively. Erythromycin resistance was due to mefA in 33 isolates, whereas 14 isolates had erm-mediated resistance (9 isolates had inducible resistance and 5 isolates had constitutive resistance). In our population, erythromycin resistance in GAS was predominantly mediated by mefA and erythromycin resistance in GBS was predominantly mediated by erm. Regional differences in mechanisms of resistance need to be taken into consideration when deciding whether to report clindamycin susceptibility results on the basis of in vitro test results. Testing by the double-disk diffusion method would be an approach that could be used to address this issue, especially for GAS."
CD011926,0,21644074,0,[Investigation of antifungal susceptibilities and some virulence factors of Candida strains isolated from blood cultures and genotyping by RAPD-PCR].,"Candidemia is a serious clinical picture with a rather high mortality. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment is crucial in this picture especially in immunocompromised cases. The aims of this retrospective study were to investigate the antifungal susceptibility patterns and to detect the presence of phospholipase, esterase and biofilm production which are excepted as virulence factors of Candida spp. strains and to evaluate the clonal relationships between isolates. A total of 46 Candida spp. Strains isolated from blood cultures of patients of whom eight were newborn and 38 were adults, between the period of February 2005 to July 2010, were included in the study. Of the isolates 17 were identified as C.albicans, 18 were C.parapsilosis, five were C.glabrata, four were C.tropicalis, one was C.guilliermondii and one was C.krusei. Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed by using ""Sensititre Yeast One (Trek Diagnostic Systems, USA)"" commercial kit. Esterase activity was detected in Tween-80 medium; phospholipase activity in yolk egg agar and biofilm formation was investigated by microplate assay. Strain genotyping was performed by RAPD-PCR (random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction) by using OPE-03, OPE-18, AP50-1, Cnd-3 and Cnd-4 primers. All strains were found to be susceptible to amphotericin B, voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin. C.krusei strain was defined as resistant (intrinsically) to fluconazole. All strains of C.albicans, C.parapsilosis, C.glabrata, and C.tropicalis were found to be susceptible to fluconazole. Three of five C.glabrata strains were resistant to itraconazole, while the other strains were found to be susceptible. All of the C.albicans strains had phospholipase and esterase activity, however none were biofilm-producing isolates. In contrast all of the C.parapsilosis strains were negative for phospholipase and esterase activity, however all were positive for biofilm formation. Phospholipase activity has not been detected in non-albicans strains; esterase activity were found positive in all of the C.tropicalis strains, while biofilm formation was detected in three C.tropicalis, one C.glabrata and one C.krusei isolates. The results of genotyping demonstrated that C.albicans strains displayed 5-8 different patterns and C. Parapsilosis strains 2-3 patterns with the use of five primers. Among C.parapsilosis strains, 14 were found identical (with the use of all the primers forming a single pattern (pattern A). In conclusion, the Candida spp. İsolated from blood samples were highly susceptible to the tested antifungals, and C.albicans strains had high phospholipase and esterase activity, while C.parapsilosis strains had high rate of positivity for biofilm formation. The predominant pattern amongst C.parapsilosis strains was thought to be related to exogenous dissemination."

Serological tests, culture methods, antigenemia tests and molecular methods are applied in the diagnosis of CMV infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of CMV in peripheral blood samples of patients who were at risk for CMV disease by shell vial cell culture, antigenemia test and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. A total of 141 blood specimens obtained from 91 patients (33 female, 58 male) with suspected CMV disease were included to the study. Five of the patients were newborns and the others aged between 17-79 years old were bone morrow (n= 81), kidney (n= 4) and liver (n= 1) transplantation patients. Shell vial (Vircell, Spain) cell culture method was applied for CMV isolation from the samples, while the detection of pp65 antigen in blood leukocytes was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence method (CINAkit Argene, Biosoft, France). The presence of CMV DNA in plasma samples was detected by RT-PCR (CMV QNP 2.0 kit; Fluorion, Iontek, Turkey) method. CMV was found positive in 72 (51%) of 141 samples by shell vial, 82 (58.2%) by antigenemia test and 49 (34.8%) by RT-PCR. Considering cell culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of antigenemia test were calculated as 81.9% and 66.6%, respectively; and for PCR those rates were 43% and 73.9%, respectively. In addition DNA sequencing (ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer; Perkin Elmer, USA) was performed for the samples of randomly selected three patients out of 15, who were yielded positive results with cell culture and antigenemia tests but negative CMV DNA by RT-PCR. In this analysis CMV DNA was found positive in three of the samples that were found negative by RT-PCR in spite of CMV isolation and positive antigenemia. DNA sequencing of those samples revealed multiple mutations in the probe binding region (gB) of CMV QNP 2.0 kit. It was concluded that for the detection of CMV viremia and viral load in patients under risk for CMV disease, antigenemia and PCR based methods could be applied, however, negative results obtained by PCR targeting CMV gB gene, should remind the possible presence of mutations in the related site and the results should be confirmed by sequence analysis."

The two predominant species were found in patients living in urban and rural areas. Most cases were found in males living in rural areas for at least three years and involved in rural work. This suggests, in most cases, a possible transmission of the disease from a rural/forest source, although some patients had not engaged in activities associated with permanence in forestall areas, which indicate a possible sandflies adaptation to the periurban setting."

CD011926,0,16519022,0,Infection in a neonate caused by Pichia fabianii: importance of molecular identification.,"Pichiafabianii, an uncommon yeast species recovered from clinical specimens, was documented as the cause of an infection in a 5-week-old female twin delivered at 25 and 3/7 weeks. She developed respiratory distress syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis. At the time of the infection, she was febrile, thrombocytopenic, and still was requiring minimal ventilatory support. Blood cultures drawn on two consecutive days were positive for a germ tube negative yeast. Phenotypic methods including carbohydrate fermentations and assimilations (API 20C AUX) did not identify the yeast. Sequencing of D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rDNA was performed in one laboratory and sequencing a subunit of D2 performed in a second laboratory identified the yeast as P. fabianii. The organism was susceptible in vitro to amphotericin B, fluconazole and 5-fluorocytosinc. The patient responded to amphotericin B and removal of her vascular catheter. This case illustrates that there are an increasing number of fungi that may be pathogenic. Phenotypic tests may fail to identify them, emphasizing the need for commercially available, molecular based assays for identification."
CD011926,0,14748071,0,Simultaneous detection and differentiation of human polyomaviruses JC and BK by a rapid and sensitive PCR-ELAHA assay and a survey of the JCV subtypes within an Australian population.,"Human polyomaviruses JCV and BKV can cause several clinical manifestations in immunocompromised hosts, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and haemorrhagic cystitis. Molecular detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is recognised as a sensitive and specific method for detecting human polyomaviruses in clinical samples. In this study, we developed a PCR assay using a single primer pair to amplify a segment of the VP1 gene of JCV and BKV. An enzyme linked amplicon hybridisation assay (ELAHA) using species-specific biotinylated oligonucleotide probes was used to differentiate between JCV and BKV. This assay (VP1-PCR-ELAHA) was evaluated and compared to a PCR assay targeting the human polyomavirus T antigen gene (pol-PCR). DNA sequencing was used to confirm the polyomavirus species identified by the VP1-PCR-ELAHA and to determine the subtype of each JCV isolate. A total of 297 urine specimens were tested and human polyomavirus was detected in 105 specimens (35.4%) by both PCR assays. The differentiation of JCV and BKV by the VP1-PCR-ELAHA showed good agreement with the results of DNA sequencing. Further, DNA sequencing of the JCV positive specimens showed the most prevalent JCV subtype in our cohort was 2a (27%) followed by 1b (20%), 1a (15%), 2c (14%), 4 (14%) and 2b (10%). The results of this study show that the VP1-PCR-ELAHA is a sensitive, specific and rapid method for detecting and differentiating human polyomaviruses JC and BK and is highly suitable for routine use in the clinical laboratory."
CD011926,0,15988082,0,[Neurological symptoms of cytomegalovirus infection in children].,"Cytomegalovirus is considered as one of the most common causes of congenital infections. Clinical signs of infection are present in newborns whose mothers were infected during pregnancy. Disease is most severe if mother were infected during the first trimester. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection causes damage of CNS (central nervous system) and the liver, atrophy of optical nerve and hearing retardation up to complete loss. The most severe and frequent damage is of CNS. Under our observation were 20 children of different ages, among them 8 newborns. Verification of cytomegalovirus infection was done by ELISA. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was also used for diagnostic reasons. Examination of CNS was performed by neurosonography, electroencephalography and computed tomography. Four from eight newborns died at the age of 6-8 weeks (in these cases the generalized form of infection with severe damage of CNS was present). In the rest patients treatment with specific anticytomegalovirus immunoglobulin together with syndrome therapy yielded positive effect. Lately moderate retardation of phychomotor development became apparent in all cases. 12 patients, who come to our clinic in the period from 2 months to 1.5 years of age, psychomotor retardation, micro or hydrocephaly, hyperkinesias, absentia (epileptica), convulsive syndrome and malignant hypertension were present. On tomograms intracranial calcificats and cysts, also atrophy of cerebrum and encephalomalacia was visible. Sensory hearing loss was apparent in two patients.

During 2009 and 2010, 1975 women living in the health districts of three university hospitals were enrolled via midwives or at the time of delivery. Diagnosis of disease was performed using two serological tests with different antigens. Congenital infection was diagnosed by parasitological, molecular or serological methods from blood samples obtained at birth or in subsequent controls. The overall seroprevalence of Chagas infection in pregnant women from 16 different endemic countries was 11·4%. Infection was higher in those from countries in the Gran Chaco Region (Bolivia, 34·1%; Paraguay, 7·4%; Argentina, 5·3%). Eight newborn infants from Bolivian mothers had congenital Chagas which represents a vertical transmission rate of 3·7%. In conclusion, this work supports the benefits of offering an early diagnosis to pregnant women and newborns during routine prenatal healthcare."

Enhanced signal strength from two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and microarray analysis mapped the EV to a 284-kb interval in the reference genome. This interval consists of a sequence gap flanked by segmental duplications that contain the 12-kb components of one of the largest Variable Number Tandem Repeat arrays in the human genome. Using digital NanoString technology with a custom probe for the RNA exonuclease 1 homologue (S. cerevisiae)-like 1 (REXO1L1) gene within each 12-kb repeat, significantly enhanced diploid copy numbers of 270 and 265 were found in an EV family and a median diploid copy number of 166 copies in 216 controls. These 8q21.2 EVs are not thought to have clinical consequences as the phenotypes of the probands were inconsistent, those referred for reproductive reasons were otherwise phenotypically normal and the REXO1L1 gene has no known disease association. This EV was found in 4/3078 (1 in 770) consecutive referrals for chromosome analysis and needs to be distinguished from pathogenic imbalances of medial 8q. The REXO1L1 gene product is a marker of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and a possible association between REXO1L1 copy number and susceptibility to HCV infection, progression or response to treatment has not yet been excluded."
CD011926,0,16721859,0,CMV DNA detection in dried blood spots for diagnosing congenital CMV infection in Japan.,"Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a leading congenital infectious agent in developed countries. In the past, the incidence of congenital infection has been rather low in Japan because a high seroprevalence of CMV present in young women. However, this seroprevalence has been decreasing in recent years, so that the incidence of congenital CMV infection in Japanese neonates may increase and approach the level seen in other developed countries. The method was used for detecting CMV DNA reported by Barbi et al. [Barbi et al. (1996): Clin Diagn Virol 6:27-32] using a dried blood spot on filter paper, to diagnose congenital CMV infection in Japanese neonates. This method is effective and less laborious than virus isolation both for epidemiological studies and for identifying asymptomatic infected babies. Japanese neonates (1,176) were examined; two of who were asymptomatic were found to be infected."

HTLV-2 is present in Native American populations and associated with IV drug use in Europe and North America. In Brazil, it is estimated that 1.5 million people are infected with HTLV-1/2. The study objective was to determine HTLV-1/2 prevalence in pregnant women in the prenatal care from three public services in São Luis, State of Maranhão, Brazil, and to counsel seropositive women to reduce viral transmission."
CD011926,0,1349936,0,HIV replication during the first weeks of life.,"Diagnosis of HIV infection among children born to HIV-positive mothers can be made in the first 12 months, but few studies have examined HIV status during the first weeks of life. In a prospective longitudinal study of 50 infants born to HIV-1 seropositive women, blood samples were obtained at birth and at 4-9 weeks and 5-9 months of age, and were tested for HIV-1 by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral culture, and p24 antigen measurements. 16 were diagnosed as HIV-infected by the age of 4-9 weeks according to both PCR and culture; by contrast, infection could be detected in only 5 children at birth. No changes in HIV status were observed between 4-9 weeks and 5-9 months in the 44 children who could be retested. Perinatal HIV-1 infection can therefore be diagnosed in the first 2 months of life, either by PCR or viral culture. Our inability to detect HIV-1 infection at birth in almost 70% of babies subsequently found infected suggests an active replication of HIV during the first weeks of life. Our results might favour the hypothesis that transmission of HIV-1 takes place either at the end of pregnancy or at delivery."
CD011926,0,22085160,0,Acute varicella zoster encephalitis without evidence of primary vasculopathy in a case-series of 20 patients.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a leading cause of acute viral encephalitis but little is known about its clinical, biological and imaging features. Furthermore, the most favourable treatment regimen has not been determined. We studied a prospective cohort of 20 HIV-negative patients presenting with acute VZV encephalitis caused by primary infection or reactivation. VZV was identified in 16 of 20 cases by PCR detection of the DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. The four remaining cases occurred during or soon after a VZV rash. The median age of the 17 adults was 76 (19-86) years; the three other patients were children (0.5-5 years). Three patients were immunocompromised. Nine adult patients presented with a rash. Eighteen patients presented with fever and an acute encephalitic syndrome: diffuse brain dysfunction, focal neurological signs, seizures and cranial nerve palsies. Three patients presented with either ventricular or subdural haemorrhage, one with myelitis, and one with asymptomatic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery. The imaging was either normal or revealed non-specific abnormalities such as cortical atrophy but no evidence of stroke. All patients were given acyclovir at various dosages and durations but the case fatality rate remained high (15%) and sequelae were frequently observed either at discharge or at follow-up 3 years later."
CD011926,0,12043157,0,[Comparative efficacy of laboratory methods for cytomegalovirus detection in autopsy material].,"Eighty eight autopsy specimens obtained from 30 fetuses, still-borns and infants died during the first year of life, all suspected for congenital virus infection at postmortem examination, were studied. The specimens were analyzed by 3 techniques: rapid culture method (RCM) for detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infectious activity, the immunocytochemical method for detection of CMV antigen in prints of organs and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection CMV DNA. CMV was detected in 16 out of 26 specimens (61.5%) by PCR, in 43 out of 88 specimens (49%) by RCM and in 15 out of 64 specimens (23%) in prints. The comparison of immune reagents revealed that monoclonal antibodies (McAb) were more specific than polyclonal serum antibodies, as the latter yielded the positive reaction in 10 out of 26 cases (38%), found to be negative in PCR. The data thus obtained indicate that complex techniques, including PCR and RCM in combination with McAb, should be used for evaluation of CMV infection role in child mortality."

CD011926,0,15269294,0,Direct detection of Staphylococcus aureus from adult and neonate nasal swab specimens using real-time polymerase chain reaction.,"Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is considered a source of subsequent infection in health care settings. Utilization of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of S. aureus has the potential to dramatically affect infection control practice by rapidly identifying S. aureus-colonized patients. We developed and validated the use of real-time PCR for detection of S. aureus colonization in two patient populations. Paired nasal swabs were collected from 299 neonates and from 151 adult patients at Evanston Hospital. One swab was used for culture and the other placed into a bacterial lysis solution containing achromopeptidase. The DNA liberated was used as the template for real-time PCR with primers for the femA gene. SYBR Green was used for amplicon detection. In the neonatal population the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value positive and predictive value negative for culture and PCR was 92% versus 96%, 100% versus 100%, 100% versus 100%, and 98% versus 99%, respectively. In the adults the results were 90% versus 100%, 100% versus 98%, 100% versus 96%, and 95% versus 100%, respectively. Real-time PCR was able to detect S. aureus in 2 hours compared to 1 to 4 days for culture and provided sensitivity equal to or greater than culture."
CD011926,0,7751717,0,The incidence of human parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy and its impact on perinatal outcome.,"A prospective study of parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy was conducted at a large teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Women (1610) who were < 28 weeks pregnant at enrollment were screened for parvovirus infection. The prevalence of IgG positivity was 35.03% (564/1610). The incidence of acute infection during pregnancy was 3.7% (60/1610). There were five abortions among the B19-infected women but only one was caused by parvovirus, as assessed by histologic examination and polymerase chain reaction assay. The incidence of fetal loss caused by parvovirus was, therefore, 1.66% (1/60). The remaining 55 pregnancies were uneventful, and at 1 year of age, none of the infants had serious abnormalities. The incidence of vertical transmission of infection was estimated at 25%. This study provides evidence that although acute parvovirus infection may occur relatively commonly during pregnancy, an adverse fetal outcome is a rare complication."
CD011926,0,22773124,0,Incidence and risk factors of EBV reactivation after unrelated cord blood transplantation: a Eurocord and Société Française de Greffe de Moelle-Therapie Cellulaire collaborative study.,"EBV viremia and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) have been associated with high mortality rates after allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (allo-HSCT). Few retrospective studies, without EBV load monitoring postulated that umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) might be associated with high incidence of EBV events. We retrospectively studied 175 UCBT recipients for whom RQ-PCR was used to monitor EBV blood load at least once a week during the first 3 months after UCBT. Median age was 23 years, 74% had leukemia. Conditioning was myeloablative in 54% and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was used in 46%. A total of 24 patients presented an EBV reactivation. For 15 patients, the reactivation occurred during the first 100 days (cumulative incidence: 8%) and included 4 EBV-PTLD. Rituximab as preemptive treatment was used in 12 of these 15 patients. In univariate analysis, the increased risk of early EBV reactivation was associated with RIC in combination with antithymocyte globulin (P=0.03) and previous history of auto-HSCT (P=0.01). Multivariate analysis did not find any independent risk factor. EBV reactivation as time-dependent covariate was not statistically associated with survival. Therefore, EBV events were not major complications after UCBT when EBV load is weekly monitored and preemptive treatment started."

CD011926,0,9359739,0,Low detection rate and maternal provenance of hepatitis B virus S gene mutants in cases of failed postnatal immunoprophylaxis in England and Wales.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection occurred despite full passive-active immunoprophylaxis in 20 of 321 infants born to mothers seropositive for hepatitis B e antigen. In 2 (12%) of 17 infected infants, mother-infant DNA sequence mismatches were found in a segment of the HBV S gene coding for antigenic determinants of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) amplified from sera by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Point substitutions occurred in codons 120, 134, and 144 of the HBsAg polypeptide in the variant sequence of 1 infant and in codon 126 in the other; all were missense mutations. Mutant sequences could not be recovered from maternal sera by PCR cloning but were selectively generated using an amplification refractory mutation system. The frequency of potential vaccine escape mutants is therefore low, and these preexist maternally as minor variants."

However, there are few data on the prevalence of neonatal GBS infections in China. The aim of this retrospective study was to estimate whether GBS is an important pathogen in severe neonatal pneumonia, and to develop a method for detection of GBS infections in fatal neonatal pneumonia."
CD011926,0,8708494,0,Detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA by polymerase chain reaction: a preliminary study in Bangkok.,"Nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR) was used to separately amplify part of gag, pol, and env genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to evaluate that primer specific to either gag (SK380/390&SK38/39), pol (JA17/18&JA19/20), or env (JA9/10&JA11/12) genes is suitable for HIV-1 PCR based diagnosis in Thailand. The positive PCR results in 70 HIV-1 infected adults are 100, 97, 89 per cent and in 75 HIV-1 infected infants are 100, 94, 74 per cent by gag, pol, env primer, respectively. The specificity of all three primer sets is 100 per cent. The unamplified samples by pol and env primers were identified as HIV-1 subtype E by PELISA method. False negative in HIV-1 PCR based diagnosis caused by high genetic variation of HIV-1 can be overcome by using several primer sets as shown in this study."

All strains were previously studied by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) (R. Quentin, H. Huet, F.-S. Wang, P. Geslin, A. Goudeau, and R. K. Selander, J. Clin. Microbiol. 33:2576-2581, 1995). Among these 114 strains, there were 92 PFGE patterns. Eleven genetic groups (A to K) were identified with 38% divergence. A more homogeneous group (PFGE group A) was defined, consisting of 73% of the strains previously identified as belonging to a particular MLEE phylogenetic group. A 162-kb fragment was identified as a marker of strains that invaded the central nervous system of neonates. It was detected in 69% of the PFGE patterns obtained with CSF isolates and in only 1.8% of the PFGE patterns obtained with carrier strains. The hylB gene encoding hyaluronate lyase was amplified for all strains in our collection. Ten of 15 isolates belonging to an MLEE subgroup, previously described as being likely to cause invasive infection, had an insertion in the hylB gene (IS1548)."
CD011926,0,16198443,0,A simultaneous outbreak of Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a neonatal intensive care unit.,"We describe two concurrent outbreaks of Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Over a 16-month period, a total of 27 infants were either colonized (N=14) or infected (N=13). There were 15 cases of S. marcescens and 11 cases of K. pneumoniae. Both micro-organisms were involved in one fatal case. Seven preterm babies developed septicaemia, two had bacteraemia, three had respiratory infections and one had purulent conjunctivitis. The S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae isolates were investigated by three molecular methods: enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), arbitrary primed PCR with M13 primer, and random amplification of polymorphic DNA. Different patterns were found in the 16 S. marcescens epidemic isolates from 16 newborn infants. The major epidemic-involved genotype was linked to the first nine cases and this was subsequently replaced by different patterns. Eight different typing profiles were also determined for the 13 K. pneumoniae isolates from 12 newborn infants. Four K. pneumoniae bacteraemic strains proved to be identical. In conclusion, the typing results revealed that two different micro-organisms (S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae) were simultaneously involved in invasive nosocomial infections in preterm newborns. Two simultaneous clusters of cases were documented. Heterogeneous genotypes among both species were also demonstrated to be present in the NICU at the same time. A focal source for both micro-organisms was not identified but cross-transmission through handling was probably an important route in this outbreak. Strict adherence to handwashing policies, cohorting, isolation of colonized and infected patients, and rigorous environmental hygiene were crucial measures in the containment of the epidemic."
CD011926,0,9350745,0,Performance of the Amplicor human immunodeficiency virus type 1 PCR and analysis of specimens with false-negative results.,"Over a 4-year period, the Roche Amplicor kit was used in a United Kingdom reference laboratory for the detection or confirmation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection, particularly in infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Of 408 specimens from adults and older children tested, the 122 seronegative specimens were all Amplicor negative. Of the 286 seropositive specimens, 268 were Amplicor positive. On the basis of these results, the Amplicor assay has a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 93.7%. In addition, for 247 specimens from infants and young children, serological results may not have been diagnostic because of placental transfer of maternal antibodies. Forty-eight were Amplicor positive, and of the 199 Amplicor-negative specimens, 19 were assumed to be false negative on the basis of clinical data, serological markers (including p24 antigen), and/or results for previous or follow-up specimens. This represents a sensitivity of 75% for the Amplicor test for specimens from patients under 2 years of age. Of these 37 false-negative specimens plus 2 specimens from other laboratories, 31 could be characterized by amplifying extracted material from them by an in-house nested gag PCR spanning the Amplicor target region. The amplicons were sequenced and found to represent subtypes A (35.5%), B (22.6%), C (22.6%), D (16.1%), and G (3.2%). False-negative results by the Amplicor assay may be ascribed to low-target copy number, the physical behavior of one primer (SK462), and sequence variation in the target region of the other primer (SK431)."
CD011926,0,26719435,0,Performances of Four Real-Time PCR Assays for Diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia.,"Pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) is a frequent infection among HIV-positive or other immunocompromised patients. In the past several years, PCR on pulmonary samples has become an essential element for the laboratory diagnosis of PCP. Nevertheless, very few comparative studies of available PCR assays have been published. In this work, we evaluated the concordance between four real-time PCR assays, including three commercial kits, AmpliSens, MycAssay, and Bio-Evolution PCR, and an in-house PCR (J. Fillaux et al. 2008, J Microbiol Methods 75:258-261, doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2008.06.009), on 148 pulmonary samples. The results showed concordance rates ranging from 81.6% to 96.6% (kappa, 0.64 to 0.93). Concordance was excellent between three assays: the in-house assay, AmpliSens, and the MycAssay PCR (kappa, >0.8). The performances of these PCR assays were also evaluated according to the classification of the probability of PCP (proven, probable, possible, or no final diagnosis of PCP) based on clinical and radiological signs as well as on the direct examination of bronchoalveolar lavage samples. In the proven PCP category, Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA was detected with all four assays. In the probable PCP category, the in-house PCR, AmpliSens, and the MycAssay PCR were positive for all samples, while the Bio-Evolution PCR failed to detect Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA in two samples. In the possible PCP category, the percentage of positive samples according to PCR varied from 54.5% to 86.4%. Detection of colonized patients is discussed. Finally, among the four evaluated PCR assays, one was not suitable for colonization detection but showed good performance in the proven and probable PCP groups. For the three other assays, performances were excellent and allowed detection of a very low fungal burden."
CD011926,0,18574659,0,"Remarkably high prevalence of fts I gene mutations in Haemophilus influenzae isolates from upper respiratory tract infections in children of the Sapporo district, Japan.","Recently, the frequency of isolation of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin resistant (BLNAR) strains of Haemophilus influenzae in Japanese children has been increasing rapidly. Drug resistance in BLNAR strains is associated with mutations of the fts I gene, which encodes penicillin-binding protein 3. In the otolaryngological field, only a few reports have been available concerning fts I gene mutations in BLNAR. We investigated the prevalence of fts I gene mutations, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping, in H. influenzae isolates from the upper respiratory tracts of children in the Sapporo district, Japan. When the isolates were classified according to PCR genotyping, 34 (44.2%) of 77 isolates were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-sensitive (g-BLNAS), 8 (10.4%) were g-low-BLNAR, 30 (39.0%) were g-high-BLNAR, 2 (2.6%) were beta-lactamase-positive ampicillin-resistant (g-BLPAR), and 3 (3.9%) were beta-lactamase-positive ampicillin/clavulanic acid-resistant (g-high-BLPACR). Mutations in the fts I gene were generally parallel to ampicillin susceptibility, and were frequently observed in children who were 7 years or younger. Of the beta-lactams tested, cefditoren showed the strongest inhibition of H. influenzae isolates, and it inhibited g-BLNAR and g-BLPACR. This study revealed a remarkably high prevalence of fts I gene mutations (g-BLNAR and g-BLPACR) in our district. Furthermore, a regional difference in the prevalence of fts I gene mutations was observed even at the district level."
CD011926,0,9574705,0,"Nosocomial outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing SHV-5 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, originating from a contaminated ultrasonography coupling gel.","Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ceftazidime was isolated from six adult women and two neonates hospitalized between July and November 1993 in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Boucicaut Hospital (Paris, France). The epidemiological investigation revealed a notably short delay (less than 48 h) between admission and contamination of the six adults and peripartum transmission to the neonates. The only environmental source of ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae was the ultrasonography coupling gel used in the emergency room. Phenotypic (biotyping and antibiotyping) and genotypic (plasmid profile and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) analysis of all the clinical isolates indicated the spread of a single strain. It produced SHV-5 and TEM-1 beta-lactamases, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing and gene sequencing. The risk of cross-contamination in ultrasonography procedures is usually low and had not been associated so far with bacteria producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Furthermore, this is the first time an epidemic of an SHV-5 ESBL-producing member of the family Enterobacteriaceae has been reported from a French hospital."

However, serious consequences of rubella infection can result when the infection occurs during the early stages of pregnancy. After the occurrence of a rubella outbreak in Japan that was observed from 2012 to 2013, 45 infants were reportedly born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). We prospectively followed the 15 CRS cases reported in Tokyo to determine the virus shedding periods by using nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to detect rubella virus genes. Throast swabs were used for virus detection. The virus shedding period was measured from birth until the time when the sample last tested positive followed by 2 consecutive negative samples. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the proportion of cases remaining positive for rubella virus genes over time. The proportion of CRS cases shedding virus dropped steadily after birth, dropping to 33.8% at 6 months and 16.9% at 12 months. Our findings also suggested that the earlier the mother's onset of rubella during pregnancy, the longer the infant remained positive. Based on our findings, we believe that infants with CRS should be monitored for rubella virus shedding until 1 year of age."

CD011926,0,16423610,0,Cerebrospinal fluid mononuclear cell predominance is not related to symptom duration in children with enteroviral meningitis.,We used a binomial regression model to determine the relationship between the percent of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mononuclear white blood cells and symptom duration in children with proven enteroviral meningitis. The odds of a CSF white blood cell being mononuclear increased by 15.7% (95% confidence interval: -3.8% to 38.0%; P = .11) for each day of symptoms. Fifty percent of patients with symptoms of 1 day or less had predominance of mononuclear cells among CSF white blood cells. These findings suggest that factors other than symptom duration influence the composition and evolution of the CSF white blood cell response to enteroviral infection.

Eight infants had multiorgan disease, four with severe myocardial dysfunction, of whom two died. All of the infants with severe disease developed symptoms within 7 days of age. In infants presenting within 10 days of birth, in all cases there were symptoms compatible with maternal infection prior to delivery. Severity was associated with perinatal transmission. Enteroviral polymerase chain reaction of CSF, urine, stool or throat swab was positive in nine of the ten babies. Seven of the infants were treated with a 7-day course of the new anti-picornaviral drug pleconaril (5 mg/kg 3 times daily)."

CD011926,0,25361230,0,Parvovirus infection: an immunohistochemical study using fetal and placental tissue.,"Parvovirus B19 infection causes 5% to 15% of cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of immunohistochemistry in diagnosing parvovirus infection in fetal and placental tissue during routine fetal and perinatal autopsies. Histology slides of 20 cases of confirmed parvovirus infection were reviewed, and immunohistochemistry was applied to selected blocks of fetal and placental tissue. Immunohistochemistry was positive in all 20 cases, and histologic viral inclusions were seen in 19 cases. Immunohistochemical staining was closely correlated with histology and was more sensitive than histology in detecting virally infected cells, especially in autolyzed tissue. All cases also had confirmatory evidence of parvovirus infection by polymerase chain reaction of fetal liver and positive maternal serology, where it was available. We conclude that parvovirus immunohistochemistry is a reliable method for diagnosing parvovirus infection, especially in autolyzed tissue where histologic assessment may be suboptimal."

CD011926,0,9435033,0,Retrospective diagnostics of congenital cytomegalovirus infection performed by polymerase chain reaction in blood stored on filter paper.,"Capillary blood samples from 63 infants collected 3-7 days after birth, and thereafter stored on filter papers for 12-18 y, were tested for the presence of CMV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Of 16 infants with proven congenital CMV infection (positive virus isolation test in urine sampled within 1 week of age), 13 (81%) had a positive CMV PCR test and 3 (19%) a negative PCR test. All blood samples from 16 control infants without congenital CMV infection (negative virus isolation test in urine sampled within 1 week of age) were CMV PCR-negative. When 31 samples on filter papers stored above or below the samples of the infected infants were tested, 6 (19%) had a weak reactivity. This suggests that CMV DNA can be transferred from one filter paper to another during storage. We conclude that PCR performed on dried blood stored on filter paper is a useful method in the retrospective diagnostics of congenital CMV infection. Consideration must be given, however, to the possibility of transfer of CMV DNA from blood samples stored nearby."
CD011926,0,19089556,0,Comprehensive detection of causative pathogens using real-time PCR to diagnose pediatric community-acquired pneumonia.,"We have developed a real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) method to detect 13 respiratory viruses: influenza virus A and B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subgroup A and B; parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, and 3; adenovirus; rhinovirus (RV); enterovirus; coronavirus (OC43); human metapneumovirus (hMPV); and human bocavirus (HBoV). The new method for detection of these viruses was applied simultaneously with real-time PCR for the detection of six bacterial pathogens in clinical samples from 1700 pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Of all the patients, 32.5% were suspected to have single bacterial infections; 1.9%, multiple bacterial infections; 15.2%, coinfections of bacteria and viruses; 25.8%, single viral infections; and 2.1%, multiple viral infections. In the remaining 22.6%, the etiology was unknown. The breakdown of suspected causative pathogens was as follows: 24.4% were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 14.8% were Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 11.3% were Haemophilus influenzae, and 1.4% were Chlamydophila pneumoniae. The breakdown of viruses was as follows: 14.5% were RV, 9.4% were RSV, 7.4% were hMPV, 7.2% were PIV, and 2.9% were HBoV. The new method will contribute to advances in the accuracy of diagnosis and should also result in the appropriate use of antimicrobials."

CD011926,0,16199646,0,Genital herpes complicating pregnancy.,"Approximately 22% of pregnant women are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2, and 2% of women will acquire HSV during pregnancy. Remarkably, up to 90% of these women are undiagnosed because they are asymptomatic or have subtle symptoms attributed to other vulvovaginal disorders. Diagnosis of genital herpes relies on laboratory confirmation with culture or polymerase chain reaction assay of genital lesions and type-specific glycoprotein G-based serologic testing. Neonatal herpes is the most severe complication of genital HSV infection and is caused by contact with infected genital secretions at the time of labor. Maternal acquisition of HSV in the third trimester of pregnancy carries the highest risk of neonatal transmission. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal herpes, little change in the incidence or serious sequelae from this infection has occurred. As such, prevention of the initial neonatal infection is critically important. Obstetricians are in a unique position to prevent vertical HSV transmission by identifying women with genital lesions at the time of labor for cesarean delivery, prescribing antiviral suppressive therapy as appropriate, and avoiding unnecessary invasive intrapartum procedures in women with genital herpes. Enhanced prevention strategies include identification of women at risk for HSV acquisition during pregnancy by testing women and possibly their partners for HSV antibodies and providing counseling to prevent transmission to women in late pregnancy."

CD011926,0,16822689,0,"Rapid detection of the ""highly virulent"" group B Streptococcus ST-17 clone.","Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that the sequence type ST-17 defines a ""highly virulent"" serotype III clone strongly associated with neonatal invasive infections. Our aim was to identify a target sequence enabling rapid, simple, and specific detection of this clone by a real-time PCR assay. Conventional methods for DNA manipulation and gene analyses were used to characterize the gbs2018 gene variant specific for ST-17 clone and to design ST-17- and GBS-specific primers. Conventional and real-time PCR assays were developed to detect GBS and ST-17 clones in bacterial cultures and directly on clinical samples. One hundred and fifty-six French GBS strains from various geographical areas in France isolated between 1990 and 2005 were screened by PCR with ST-17-specific primers. Forty strains were positive, and all were validated by MLST as ST-17. A representative sampling of 49 ST-17-PCR-negative strains was confirmed by MLST as non-ST-17. Real-time PCR was further used to directly test 85 vaginal samples. Among these, 13 were GBS-positive, and one was identified as ST-17. The association between strain invasiveness and ST-17 lineage in neonates with late onset disease was highly significant: 78% (P<0.0001) of strains isolated were ST-17. In conclusion, an ST-17-specific gbs2018 allele was identified and used to develop a sensitive and specific rapid-screening molecular assay for identifying ST-17 ""highly virulent"" GBS. Using this technique, accurate identification of women and neonates colonized by ST-17 can be readily achieved within less than 2 h."

CD011926,0,10524987,0,Low risk of vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus by breast milk.,"To evaluate the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission via breast milk, we collected 76 samples of breast milk from 73 chronically HCV-infected women and serum samples from their 76 perinatally HCV-exposed children. Enzyme immunoassay and strip immunoblot assay were used for detection of antibodies to HCV, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis was used for detection of HCV RNA. None of the 76 samples of breast milk contained HCV RNA, whereas 37 (59.7%) of 62 mothers tested for HCV RNA had HCV viremia. Only 1 of the 76 breast-fed infants had evidence of HCV infection. Because HCV infection in this child was detected 1 month after birth, it seems unlikely that it was transmitted by breast-feeding. These results indicate that HCV infection in pregnant women should not be a contra-indication for breast-feeding."

DEC, investigated by PCR detection of virulence factor-encoding genes associated with the distinct pathotypes, was isolated from 18.0% of the patients, and 19.0% of the controls, with enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), the most frequent pathotype, being detected in equal proportion between patients and controls (10.0%). Among the enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) isolates, only one isolate was able to produce the localized adherence pattern to HeLa cells, being thus the only typical EPEC identified. All the remaining EPEC were classified as atypical (aEPEC), and detected in 8.0% and 8.5% of the patients and controls, respectively. Regarding the serotypes, 26.5% of the analyzed EPEC isolates belonged to classical EPEC-serogroups, and the only two STEC found were serotyped as O26:H11 (patient) and O119:H7 (control). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that 43.6%, 29.5% and 2.6% of the DEC isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and gentamicin, respectively. Our data indicate that EAEC remains prevalent among children living in Botucatu, and revealed atypical EPEC as emerging putative diarrheal agents in this geographical region."

The aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic E. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. Between March 2008 and June 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for E. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-PCR. E. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. Data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic E. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering E. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. The datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). Bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 Salmonella spp., 8 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Klebsiella oxytoca, 11 Citrobacter freundii, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 Serratia spp., 7 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Shigella spp., 2 Campylobacter spp. Rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. It was found in 35 samples (21.88% of the overall collected samples), while Adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). Rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn.

A total 9907 patients between 0 to 91 years old (mean age: 25.05�19.67) were included in the epidemic. The patients� data were prospectively collected and statistically analyzed. Microbiologic analyses were performed to determine the etiologic agent. Rapid onset diarrhea (98.36%), abdominal cramps (69%), fever (44.4%) and vomiting (69.6%) were the most common symptoms observed in patients. Rotavirus antigen was detected in 52.7% of the studied patients. RT-PCR analysis led to identification of Group A rotavirus as the causative agent of this epidemic. Simultaneous measurements of the drinking water samples yielded very low chlorine levels; as low as 0 to 0.05 mg/L. The outbreak investigation team indicated possible contamination of a large water depository from a water well, which supplies drinking water to two major districts of the city. Effective chlorination and blockage of the passage between the well and the water depository stopped the outbreak. This outbreak shows the high epidemic potency of rotavirus in large human populations, including all age groups, and underlines the importance of water safety in pipeline systems."

Eighty-two patients were under five years of age. Enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) were most frequently isolated (63 patients, 58%). Eighteen of the ETEC strains also hybridized with probes for EPEC adherence factor (EAF) and Enteroaggregative (EAgg) adherence. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC) were more frequently isolated than EAF positive E.coli, and more frequently from patients with persistent diarrhoea (10/25) than from patients with acute diarrhoea (11/39). In total, 103 of the patients harboured faecal E. coli which hybridized with one or more of the virulence probes. Haemagglutination of one or more erythrocyte species was expressed by 65/70 strains. Using monoclonal antibodies to Colonization Factor Antigen I and Coli Surface antigens 1-5, only 18/66 strains were found to produce one or more of these adhesions and no more than 15 of 43 ETEC strains were agglutinated by the antisera to these adhesins. Forty-nine strains adhered to HeLa cells in autoaggregative (23 strains), localized (17 strains) or diffuse (9 strains) pattern.

Twenty-six of the 65 infants (40%) were confirmed as CRS by detection of rubella specific IgM. Rubella RNA was detected in 41 samples from 26 infants by both real-time and block based PCR. The PCR results correlated well with the presence of anti-rubella IgM/IgG (23/27 cases with rubella IgM were PCR positive). Whereas, only 17 of 26 infants met the WHO CRS case definition. Amongst the various specimens tested from the sero-confirmed cases (n = 27), a high percentage of positives were detected in lens (92%) and oral fluid (60%) specimens, when compared to other samples. The quantification of viral load by real-time PCR demonstrated higher copy number of virus in lens samples of 0-11 months infants. The rubella viruses were characterized and revealed the circulation of genotype 2B in three South Indian states. The integrated analysis of clinical manifestations, serological and molecular data in the study has generated baseline information of rubella infection and CRS in infants with ocular anomalies."

Here, over the course of one year, we performed prospective collection and whole genome sequencing of nearly all bacterial isolates obtained from a tertiary care hospital's intensive care units (ICUs). This unbiased collection of 1,229 bacterial genomes from 391 patients enables detailed exploration of several features of clinical pathogens. A sizable fraction of isolates identified as clinically relevant corresponded to previously undescribed species: 12% of isolates assigned a species-level classification by conventional methods actually qualified as distinct, novel genomospecies on the basis of genomic similarity. Pan-genome analysis of the most frequently encountered pathogens in the collection revealed substantial variation in pan-genome size (1,420 to 20,432 genes) and the rate of gene discovery (1 to 152 genes per isolate sequenced). Surprisingly, although potential nosocomial transmission of actively surveilled pathogens was rare, 8.7% of isolates belonged to genomically related clonal lineages that were present among multiple patients, usually with overlapping hospital admissions, and were associated with clinically significant infection in 62% of patients from which they were recovered. Multi-patient clonal lineages were particularly evident in the neonatal care unit, where seven separate Staphylococcus epidermidis clonal lineages were identified, including one lineage associated with bacteremia in 5/9 neonates. Our study highlights key differences in the information made available by conventional microbiological practices versus whole genome sequencing, and motivates the further integration of microbial genome sequencing into routine clinical care."

Since that article, not only have major changes been made in immunochromatographic antigen detection (IAD) testing for the influenza viruses, but there has also been rapid development of commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for influenza virus detection. Further, a novel variant of influenza A, H7N9, has emerged in Asia, and H5N1 is also reemergent. In that initial article, the editor of this series, Peter Gilligan, identified two issues that required further consideration. One was how well IAD tests worked in clinical settings, especially in times of antigen drift and shift. The other was the role of future iterations of influenza NAATs and whether this testing would be available in a community hospital setting. James Dunn, who is Director of Medical Microbiology and Virology at Texas Children's Hospital, has extensive experience using IAD tests for diagnosing influenza. He will discuss the application and value of these tests in influenza diagnosis. Christine Ginocchio, who recently retired as the Senior Medical Director, Division of Infectious Disease Diagnostics, North Shore-LIJ Health System, and now is Vice President for Global Microbiology Affairs at bioMérieux, Durham, NC, wrote the initial counterpoint in this series, where she advocated the use of NAATs for influenza diagnosis. She will update us on the commercially available NAAT systems and explain what their role should be in the diagnosis of influenza infection."

CD011926,0,16390965,0,"Detection of rhinoviruses by tissue culture and two independent amplification techniques, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and reverse transcription-PCR, in children with acute respiratory infections during a winter season.","Five hundred seventeen consecutive nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected between October 1998 and May 1999 for episodes of acute respiratory tract infections in children presenting at the University Hospital of Antwerp. Culture and nucleic acid amplification techniques--nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)--were applied to detect rhinoviruses (RVs). Other respiratory viruses were detected by immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of the specimens and IF analysis of shell vial cultures. Among the 517 specimens, 219 viral agents were identified. They were, in decreasing order, rhinoviruses (93 [18.0%]), respiratory syncytial virus (76 [14.7%]), adenoviruses (16 [3.1%]), influenza viruses (15 [2.9%]), enteroviruses (15 [2.9%]), and herpes simplex virus (4 [0.8%]). For the evaluation of rhinovirus detection, culture positivity and/or a positive reaction in the two independent amplification methods was used as an expanded ""gold standard."" Based on this standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of culture were 44.7, 100, 100, and 99.8%, and those of NASBA and RT-PCR were 85.1, 98.3, 83.3, and 98.5% and 82.9, 93.4, 55.7, and 98.2%, respectively. NASBA and RT-PCR produced comparable results and were significantly more sensitive than virus culture. RVs showed the highest incidence in acute respiratory tract infections in children."
CD011926,0,19144798,0,Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus haemolyticus.,"Infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) most frequently occur after the implantation of medical devices and are attributed to the biofilm-forming potential of CoNS. Staphylococcus haemolyticus is the second most frequently isolated CoNS from patients with hospital-acquired infections. There is only limited knowledge of the nature of S. haemolyticus biofilms. The aim of this study was to characterize S. haemolyticus biofilm formation. We analyzed the biofilm-forming capacities of 72 clinical S. haemolyticus isolates. A detachment assay with NaIO(4), proteinase K, or DNase was used to determine the main biofilm components. Biofilm-associated genes, including the ica operon, were analyzed by PCR, and the gene products were sequenced. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to elucidate the biofilm structure. Fifty-three isolates (74%) produced biofilms after growth in Trypticase soy broth (TSB) with glucose, but only 22 (31%) produced biofilms after growth in TSB with NaCl. It was necessary to dissolve the biofilm in ethanol-acetone to measure the optical density of the full biofilm mass. DNase, proteinase K, and NaIO(4) caused biofilm detachment for 100%, 98%, and 38% of the isolates, respectively. icaRADBC and polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) production were found in only two isolates. CLSM indicated that the biofilm structure of S. haemolyticus clearly differs from that of S. epidermidis. We conclude that biofilm formation is a common phenotype in clinical S. haemolyticus isolates. In contrast to S. epidermidis, proteins and extracellular DNA are of functional relevance for biofilm accumulation, whereas PIA plays only a minor role. The induction of biofilm formation and determination of the biofilm mass also needed to be optimized for S. haemolyticus."

CD011926,0,8656017,0,Detection of group C rotavirus in infants with extrahepatic biliary atresia.,"The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine liver tissue from patients with cholestatic disease for the presence of group C rotavirus RNA. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genes 5 and 6 was used, and the PCR products were subjected to liquid hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe. A second amplification with nested primers was also used. Samples from 32 subjects (20 with biliary atresia or choledochal cyst and 12 controls) were tested. Ten of 20 biliary atresia patients were positive for group C rotavirus RNA; no controls were positive (P < .003). Three of the positive patients were positive for both genes 5 and 6. Six of the 10 had > 1 sample that was positive. These data suggest a possible relationship between group C rotavirus and extrahepatic biliary atresia in the 10 patients in whom virus RNA was detected."

CD011926,0,23035184,0,Comparative assessment of a commercial kit and two laboratory-developed PCR assays for molecular diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis.,"Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide infection that may cause severe disease and is regarded as a serious health problem in France. Detection of the parasite by molecular methods is crucial for diagnosing the disease. The extreme diversity of methods and performances of Toxoplasma PCR assays makes the use of commercial PCR kits an attractive alternative, as they offer a chance for standardization. We compared the performances of three molecular methods for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii DNA in amniotic fluid: a commercial method using nested PCR and two laboratory-developed methods, one using conventional PCR and the other one real-time PCR. This evaluation was based upon a T. gondii DNA serial dilution assay, three amniotic fluid samples spiked with T. gondii at different concentrations, and a clinical cohort of 33 amniotic fluid samples. The T. gondii DNA serial dilution assay showed a much lower sensitivity for the commercial kit than for the laboratory-developed methods. Moreover, out of 12 proven congenital toxoplasmosis cases, 91.7% were detected by the laboratory-developed assays, whereas only 50% were detected by the commercial kit. A lack of sensitivity of the method, partly due to the presence of PCR inhibitors, was the main drawback of the commercial method. This study emphasizes that commercial PCR diagnostic kits do not systematically perform better than carefully optimized laboratory-developed methods. There is a need for thorough evaluation of such kits by proficient groups, as well as for performance standards that commercial kits can be tested against to improve confidence in those selected by health care providers."

Eight neonates born to human immunodeficiency virus-infected mothers were enrolled to receive 1 mg of d4T per kg of body weight twice daily and 100 mg of ddI per m(2) once daily in combination with nelfinavir for 4 weeks after birth. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed at 14 and 28 days of age. For d4T, on days 14 and 28, the median areas under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h (AUC(0-12)s) were 1,866 and 1,603, ng x h/ml, respectively, and the median peak concentrations (C(max)s) were 463 and 507 ng/ml, respectively. For ddI, on days 14 and 28, the median AUC(0-10)s were 1,573 and 1,562 h x ng/ml, respectively, and the median C(max)s were 627 and 687 ng/ml, respectively. Systemic levels of exposure to d4T were comparable to those seen in children, suggesting that the pediatric dose of 1 mg/kg twice daily is appropriate for neonates at 2 to 4 weeks of age. Levels of exposure to ddI were modestly higher than those seen in children. Whether this observation warrants a reduction of the ddI dose in neonates is unclear."

However, among children infected despite prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), a substantial proportion will acquire NNRTI-resistant HIV, potentially compromising response to NNRTI-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). In countries scaling up PMTCT and pediatric ART programs, it is crucial to assess the proportion of young children with drug-resistant HIV to improve health outcomes and support national and global decision making on optimal selection of pediatric first-line ART. This article summarizes a new World Health Organization surveillance protocol to assess resistance using remnant dried blood spot specimens from a representative sample of children aged <18 months being tested for early infant diagnosis."

All HIV-1 seropositive children admitted to the Pedro de Elizalde Children's Hospital in Buenos Aires from March 1, 1987, to December 31, 1992, were enrolled in this study. The number of patients enrolled dramatically increased each year during the period of study. Of the 60 infected children, 22 (36.66%) have died with a clinical diagnosis of HIV-1 infection; in 10 of those children HIV infection was also confirmed by P24 antigenemia and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR): 20 qualified for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) P2D class (P2D1 = 7, P2D2 = 10, P2D3 = 3), 1 for P2C, and 1 for P2A, whose cause of death was pneumonia. The mean age of death was 14.8 months, 18 (82%) died before 18 months. When immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA levels were determined according to age and clinical status, significant differences (P < 0.005) were observed when both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected children (P1, P2) were compared with noninfected children (P3). A significant difference was also obtained between those children who qualified for P2 classification prior to 12 months of age who died early (at or prior to 25 months) and those who reached stage P2 after 12 months of age and have survived to date (X2 = 24.73, p < 0.0001; RR = 5.83, 2.52 < RR < 13.49)."

Nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) was compared with immunofluorescence (IF) for the detection of RSV subtypes A and B in children with suspected bronchiolitis. Co-infection with influenza A(H3N2), Chlamydia spp. and picornavirus/rhinovirus was also investigated using molecular techniques.A total of 50 nasopharyngeal secretions collected from babies admitted with bronchiolitis in the month of January 2000, comprising IF RSV positive (N= 27) and RSV negative (N= 23) specimens, were tested for both RSV subtypes, influenza A(H3N2), Chlamydia spp. and picornavirus/rhinovirus by nPCR. Nested PCR detected 28 specimens positive for RSV (RSV A = 20, RSV B = 8), which was two more than detected by IF. Influenza A(H3N2) was detected in three specimens, Chlamydia trachomatis in one, and picornavirus in 11, of which nine were confirmed to be rhinovirus by nPCR. Dual infection was detected in five cases using nPCR. Nested PCR proved useful in detecting RSV and influenza A(H3N2) infections missed by IF, and also other respiratory tract pathogens not routinely investigated. The clinical implications and risk of cross-infection with potentially virulent viruses due to inaccurate results from insensitive techniques, highlights the need for molecular assays such as nPCR to be employed as a routine method of investigation, provided as part of the laboratory service. Cohorting of patients with clinical bronchiolitis should continue, whilst awaiting laboratory confirmation."

CD011926,0,16529966,0,Genomic diversity and evolution within the species Streptococcus agalactiae.,"Streptococcus agalactiae is a leading cause of invasive infections in neonates, and responsible for bovine mastitis. It is also a commensal bacterium adapted to asymptomatic colonization of the mammalian gut and of the genitourinary tract. Here, we report the analysis of a collection of 75 strains of human and animal origin by using serotyping, multilocus sequence typing, whole genome DNA-array hybridizations and sequence comparison of putatively virulence-associated loci. Although the most variable parts of the genome are the previously predicted genomic islands, significant genetic variations were present in the genome backbone. Evolution within genes encoding surface and secreted proteins and those involved in the biosynthesis of different capsular types is mainly due to recombination events leading to the replacement of a locus of several genes or to the allelic exchange of the internal part of a gene. These two processes, which led to a broad diversity of surface protein patterns, are probably involved in the diversity of interactions with the host and its immune system. According to gene content comparisons and phylogeny, recent gene replacements by horizontal gene transfer may occur but are rare events. Although specific gene patterns, with respect to the origin of the strains and the epidemiological characteristics, were not identified, we show that the recently described hypervirulent ST-17 lineage is a homogeneous group. The study highlights for the first time that this lineage contains a specific and conserved set of surface proteins, probably accounting for its high capacity to cause infections in newborns."
CD011926,0,18479199,0,Macrolide-resistance mechanisms in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from Chinese children in association with genes of tetM and integrase of conjugative transposons 1545.,"This study investigated macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae carried by Beijing children presenting with respiratory tract infections. Nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae strains were tested for sensitivity with 15 antibiotics and further analyzed for phenotypes of macrolide-resistant strains and by PCR for the macrolide-resistant genes ermB, mefA, tetM, and integrase of conjugative transposon (Tn1545) intTn. We found 185 strains of S. pneumoniae relatively highly resistant to erythromycin (78.9%), clindamycin (76.2%), tetracycline (86%), and SMZ-TMP (78.7%) but with relatively low resistance to amoxicillin (2.2%), cefaclor (15.5%), ceftriaxone (2.8%), and cefuroxime (14.1%). The 146 strains of erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae showed extensive cross-resistance to other macrolides like azithromycin (100%), clarithromycin (100%), acetylspiramycin (95.2%), and clindamycin (95.9%). Genes ermB and mefA were detected in all erythromycin-resistant strains, with ermB(+) 79.5%, ermB + mefA(+) 17.8%, and mefA(+) 2.7%. About 96.9% of tetracycline-resistant isolates were positive for tetM, compared to 26.9% of sensitive strains. Ninety percent of tetracycline-resistant strains were also erythromycin-resistant versus 11.5% of tetracycline-sensitive strains. The intTn gene was present in 87.6% of S. pneumoniae strains and correlated with erythromycin and tetracycline resistance. The close relationship between the conjugative transposon Tn1545 and the genes ermB and tetM is probably one of the important mechanisms explaining the multiple drug resistance of S. pneumoniae."
CD011926,0,14715730,0,Multiplex real-time PCR assay for detection of influenza and human respiratory syncytial viruses.,"A multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed with a LightCycler instrument for detection of influenza viruses A and B and the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). Detection of each viral product and of an internal control was based on determination of specific melting temperatures by the LightCycler software. The lower limit of detection in the multiplex PCR assay was found to be 50 copies for each viral target. In an evaluation of nasopharyngeal samples collected from hospitalized children (ages, 0 to 3 years) with acute respiratory tract infections during the winter of 2001 to 2002, a viral pathogen was detected by the multiplex PCR test in 139 (66.8%) of 208 cases, including 45 (21.6%) influenza A virus infections, no (0%) influenza B virus infections, 106 (51%) HRSV infections, and 12 (5.8%) coinfections. The multiplex PCR test was compared to rapid antigen detection assays for influenza viruses A and B (Directigen; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Md.) and HRSV (RSV TestPack; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill.) in 172 and 204 samples, respectively. After resolution of discrepant test results by use of additional PCR assays targeting other viral genes, the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the multiplex PCR assay for influenza A virus were 100 and 97.7% compared to 43.6 and 98.5% for the antigenic test. Similarly, the Se and Sp of the multiplex PCR assay for HRSV were 94.5 and 98.9% compared to 81.6 and 94.7% for the antigenic test. In conclusion, our multiplex real-time PCR assay combines both rapidity and sensitivity for detecting the most important respiratory viral pathogens in children."
CD011926,0,21471340,1,Multiplex PCR allows rapid and accurate diagnosis of bloodstream infections in newborns and children with suspected sepsis.,"Sepsis is a major health problem in newborns and children. Early detection of pathogens allows initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy that strongly correlates with positive outcomes. Multiplex PCR has the potential to rapidly identify bloodstream infections, compensating for the loss of blood culture sensitivity. In an Italian pediatric hospital, multiplex PCR (the LightCycler SeptiFast test) was compared to routine blood culture with 1,673 samples obtained from 803 children with suspected sepsis; clinical and laboratory information was used to determine the patient infection status. Excluding results attributable to contaminants, SeptiFast showed a sensitivity of 85.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 78.7 to 89.7%) and a specificity of 93.5% (95% CI = 92.1 to 94.7%) compared to blood culture. The rate of positive results was significantly higher with SeptiFast (14.6%) than blood culture (10.3%) (P < 0.0001), and the overall positivity rate was 16.1% when the results of both tests were combined. Staphylococcus aureus (11.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (29.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.5%), and Klebsiella spp. (10.1%) were the most frequently detected. SeptiFast identified 97 additional isolates that blood culture failed to detect (24.7% P. aeruginosa, 23.7% CoNS, 14.4% Klebsiella spp., 14.4% Candida spp.). Among specimens taken from patients receiving antibiotic therapy, we also observed a significantly higher rate of positivity of SeptiFast than blood culture (14.1% versus 6.5%, respectively; P < 0.0001). On the contrary, contaminants were significantly more frequent among blood cultures than SeptiFast (n = 97 [5.8%] versus n = 26 [1.6%]), respectively; P < 0.0001). SeptiFast served as a highly valuable adjunct to conventional blood culture in children, adding diagnostic value and shortening the time to result (TTR) to 6 h."

The ParaSight-F test and the ICT Malaria Pf test are commercially available kits marketed for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Both tests are antigen-capture assays based on the detection of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 in peripheral blood. Using microscopy and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method as reference standards, we performed a 'blinded' comparison of these assays for the detection of P. falciparum infection in 200 febrile travellers returning from malaria-endemic areas. As determined by PCR and microscopy, 148 travellers had malaria and, of these patients, 54.7% (81/148) were infected with P. vivax only, 31.1% (46/148) with P. falciparum only, 9.5% (14/148) with P. ovale, 0.7% (1/148) with P. malariae, and 4.1% (6/148) had mixed infections. Compared to PCR, the ParaSight-F and ICT Malaria Pf tests had initial sensitivities of 94% and 90% and specificities of 95% and 97%, respectively, for the detection of P. falciparum malaria. When discrepant samples were retested with day 0 and day 1 bloods, the sensitivities improved to 96% and 94%, respectively. The 2 remaining false negative results with the Para-Sight-F test and 2 of the 3 false negative results with the ICT Malaria Pf test occurred in samples with < 100 parasites/microL. The performance of these kits was not significantly different (P = 0.75) and both are simple, rapid, and accurate tests for the detection of P. falciparum infection in the returned traveller."

Postnatal CMV transmission has usually no consequences, but in some cases it may produce disease in preterm infants. Literature reports a broad range of breast milk-acquired CMV infections (5.7-58.6%), which depends on the study's design and the treatment of the milk. To evaluate CMV transmission via breast milk, a prospective study using a real-time PCR assay was performed. One hundred and thirty-one mothers (accounting for 160 children) accepted the participation in the study. Urine samples from the infants and breast milk samples from their mothers were collected at 3, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after delivery. CMV-DNA in breast milk was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR assay Affigene® CMV Trender (Cepheid, Bromma, Sweden). The breast milk samples from 92 mothers (92 of 131, 70.2%) were positive for CMV by PCR. CMV infection was detected in thirteen children by PCR, and four of them (30.7%) had clinical symptoms. There were not significant differences in morbidity between symptomatic and non- symptomatic patients; nonetheless, the average length of hospitalization in symptomatic children was higher than that of non-symptomatic children (P < 0.05). The rtPCR technique is useful for detection of mothers with high viral loads of CMV-DNA in milk, and might be of help to decide whether to freeze the breast milk in preterm children less than 28 weeks."

The gut contents of the Triatoma sanguisuga were found, by light microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi; PCR products hybridized with T. cruzi-specific oligonucleotide probes. Whole-blood specimens obtained from the child in July and August were negative by buffy-coat examination and hemoculture but positive by PCR and DNA hybridization, suggesting that he had low-level parasitemia.

Seven children with encephalitis and five with aseptic meningitis caused by Enterovirus 71 were seen at Otsu Municipal Hospital during the summer of 1997. The infections were confirmed serologically, although detection of the viral genome in cerebrospinal fluid was unsuccessful. Seven children were diagnosed as having hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome, two were diagnosed as having herpangina, and three patients younger than 12 months old developed no eruptions. The skin or mucosal manifestations of this outbreak demonstrated considerable variation. The Enterovirus 71 strain that caused the outbreak had a strong neurovirulent tendency. Among the patients with encephalitis, symptoms originating from the impairment of diencephalon were seen in four patients, and those originating from cerebellar impairment were seen in two patients. Brain magnetic resonance imaging in one patient revealed an abnormality in the pons. The neurologic manifestations associated with Enterovirus 71 infection may be characterized by involvement of the cerebellum, brainstem, and diencephalon. Enterovirus 71 is one of the pathogenic viruses that cause hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome, as well as a variety of other clinical manifestations. The most important of these is neurologic disease, especially in infants and young children."

CD011926,0,19900734,0,Two-step glutamate dehydrogenase antigen real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile.,"Current diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) relies upon detection of toxins A/B in stool by enzyme immunoassay [EIA(A/B)]. This strategy is unsatisfactory because it has a low sensitivity resulting in significant false negatives. We investigated the performance of a two-step algorithm for diagnosis of CDI using detection of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). GDH-positive samples were tested for C. difficile toxin B gene (tcdB) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The performance of the two-step protocol was compared with toxin detection by the Meridian Premier EIA kit in 500 consecutive stool samples from patients with suspected CDI. The reference standard among samples that were positive by either EIA(A/B) or GDH testing was culture cytotoxin neutralisation (culture/CTN). Thirty-six (7%) of 500 samples were identified as true positives by culture/CTN. EIA(A/B) identified 14 of the positive specimens with 22 false negatives and two false positives. The two-step protocol identified 34 of the positive samples with two false positives and two false negatives. EIA(A/B) had a sensitivity of 39%, specificity of 99%, positive predictive value of 88% and negative predictive value of 95%. The two-step algorithm performed better, with corresponding values of 94%, 99%, 94% and 99% respectively. Screening for GDH before confirmation of positives by PCR is cheaper than screening all specimens by PCR and is an effective method for routine use. Current EIA(A/B) tests for CDI are of inadequate sensitivity and should be replaced; however, this may result in apparent changes in CDI rates that would need to be explained in national surveillance statistics."

HIV-1 DNA was present in 70% of milk specimens collected from 47 HIV-seropositive women 0-4 days after delivery and in approximately 50% of specimens collected 6 and 12 months postpartum. p24 antigen, present in 24% of milk specimens collected from 37 seropositive women within the first 4 days postpartum, was not detected in any of the subsequent specimens. The presence of HIV-1 DNA or p24 antigen in milk was not significantly associated with maternal CD4 lymphocyte count, beta 2-microglobulin level, or fulfillment of the AIDS clinical case definition. Although the correlation of either HIV-1 proviral DNA or p24 antigen with the presence of infectious virus is not known, these data indicate the need for additional studies examining the role of breastfeeding in maternal-infant transmission of HIV-1."

In children, the clinical symptoms of human metapneumovirus are similar to those produced by respiratory syncytial virus, ranging from mild to severe diseases such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of human metapneumovirus and other common respiratory viruses among admitted to hospital infants. From January 2006 to June 2006, 99 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children younger than 12 months in order to study respiratory viruses. Human metapneumovirus detection was performed by cell culture and two RT-PCR targeting on polymerase and fusion genes. The latter gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. In 67/99 children (67%) at least one viral pathogen was identified, the viruses detected most frequently were respiratory syncytial virus (35%), human metapneumovirus (25%) and rhinovirus (19%). The results obtained in this study, show that: (1) human metapneumovirus is one of the most important viruses among children less than 12 months; (2) children infected with human metapneumovirus were significantly older than those infected by respiratory syncytial virus; (3) human metapneumovirus was associated more frequently with pneumonia whereas respiratory syncytial virus was only detected in patients with bronchiolitis; (4) there was a clear epidemiological succession pattern with only a small overlap among the viruses detected most frequently; (5) all human metapneumovirus samples were clustered within sublineage A2."

In this study, the prevalence of RV and NoV infection in 55 children with diarrhea from the rural community Akinlalu in Southwestern Nigeria was investigated using real-time PCR assays. The RV and NoV strains were genotyped by PCR and/or sequencing. RV and NoV infections occurred with a prevalence of 34.5% and 25.5% respectively, with predominance in children <1 year. Most infections occurred during the dry season with increasing prevalence of RV as the dry season progressed (October-January). Infections with RV VP6 subgroup (SG) II were more prevalent (27.3%) than SGI (7.3%). Similarly, NoV genogroup II infections were more common (23.6%) than genogroup I (1.8%). Five children out of 55 (9.1%) were co-infected with both RV and NoV. Notably, G12P[8] was the predominant RV strain (36.8%, n = 7), observed for the first time in Nigeria. The VP7 gene of the G12 strains clustered within lineage III, sharing high nucleotide identity with each other (>99%) indicating introduction in Nigeria from a single donor. Furthermore, a putative novel genotype within genogroup I NoV was detected, which till date has only been reported once in humans. To conclude, a high prevalence of the emerging G12P[8] RV strain was observed for the first time in Nigeria, as well as a putative novel NoV genotype in humans. These results provide new information which can be important for future vaccine evaluations and possible introduction in Nigeria."

CD011926,0,19654024,0,Development of duplex real-time PCR for detection of two DNA respiratory viruses.,"A method was developed for the detection and quantitation of HAdV (human adenovirus) and HBoV (human bocavirus) based on a duplex real-time PCR, the AB PCR, using a Smartcycler instrument. A control real-time PCR was carried out on albumin DNA to standardise the non-homogenous respiratory samples. No cross-reactivity was observed with viruses or bacteria that could be found in the respiratory tract. The diagnosis rate using the AB PCR on clinical samples was 10.7%: 3.4% for HBoV detection, 6.9% for HAdV detection and 0.3% double detection HBoV-HAdV. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the HAdV- and HBoV-infected patients were evaluated. In the HAdV-positive group and the HBoV-positive group the samples were classified according to the severity of the disease. The HAdV viral load did not appear to be linked to the severity of the disease. Conversely, the difference between the two HBoV groups, severe and non-severe, was significant statistically when the comparison was based on the viral load (P=0.006) or after adjustment of the viral load to the number of cells in the samples (P=0.02)."
CD011926,0,23626685,0,A real-time PCR-based semi-quantitative breakpoint to aid in molecular identification of urinary tract infections.,"This study presents a novel approach to aid in diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs). A real-time PCR assay was used to screen for culture-positive urinary specimens and to identify the causative uropathogen. Semi-quantitative breakpoints were used to screen for significant bacteriuria (presence of ≥ 10(5) CFU/ml of uropathogens) or low-level bacteriuria (containing between 10(3) and 10(4) CFU/ml of uropathogens). The 16S rDNA-based assay could identify the most prevalent uropathogens using probes for Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species and Streptococcus species. 330 urinary specimens were analysed and results were compared with conventional urine culture. Using a PCR Ct value of 25 as semi-quantitative breakpoint for significant bacteriuria resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 80%, respectively. In 78% of the samples with monomicrobial infections the assay contained probes to detect the bacteria present in the urine specimens and 99% of these uropathogens was correctly identified. Concluding, this proof-of-concept approach demonstrates that the assay can distinguish bacteriuria from no bacteriuria as well as detect the involved uropathogen within 4 hours after sampling, allowing adequate therapy decisions within the same day as well as drastically reduce consequent urine culturing."
CD011926,0,7719918,0,Sensitivity of immune complex-dissociated p24 antigen testing for early detection of human immunodeficiency virus in infants.,"Several investigators have suggested that early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in infants could be accomplished with a modified, more-sensitive, acid-dissociated p24 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique (p24 antigen immune complex dissociation [ICD]). We compared detection of HIV infection by HIV culture, PCR, and p24 antigen ICD assays in 46 infants by using samples collected independently. The detection sensitivity of the p24 antigen ICD assay was 0% with cord blood samples (2 HIV-positive infants), 38% with plasma samples from infants under 3 months of age (8 HIV-positive infants), and 58% overall (12 HIV-positive infants). By contrast, the sensitivities of HIV culture and PCR were 50% for cord blood samples, 75% for plasma samples from infants under 3 months of age, and 83% overall. These results indicate that the p24 antigen ICD does not offer the sensitivity necessary for this assay to be used as an indicator of HIV infection in infants."

Two-hundred and sixteen patients (86%) had the deletional type (- -/-alpha) and 36 (14%) patients had the non-deletional type (- -/alpha(ND)alpha). A clear genotype-phenotype correlation was found, with the non-deletional type more severe than the deletional type. Diagnosis of Hb H disease was incidental in about 60% of cases. Aplastic crises due to B19 parvovirus infection were found in five patients (2.1%), while 23 patients (9.6%) experienced one or more haemolytic crises. Nineteen patients with Hb H received sporadic red blood cell transfusions and three patients were repeatedly transfused. Forty-seven of 61 married women (77%) had 82 pregnancies. In children, mean serum ferritin was 87 +/-92 mug/l and in adults, was 192 +/- 180 mug/l in females and 363 +/- 303 mug/l in males. For the 98 male patients, a significant correlation was found between ferritin values and age (r2 = 0.33, P < 0.0001). In the Sardinian population, Hb H disease needs regular monitoring for early detection and treatment of possible complications, such as worsening of anaemia that may require red cell transfusion, cholelithiasis and iron overload."
CD011926,0,1732502,0,Diagnosis of vertical HIV-1 transmission using the polymerase chain reaction and dried blood spot specimens.,"We have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect HIV proviral sequences in minute amounts of peripheral blood collected onto newborn screening blotters. Forty-three newborns, infants, and children of HIV-infected mothers were serially studied: dried blood spot (DBS) specimens were processed for PCR; serum was assayed for HIV antibodies, p24 antigen, and immunoglobulins; mononuclear cells were cultured and CD4 cells were quantitated by immunofluorescence. There was excellent agreement between the results of blood spot PCR, viral culture, and clinical and immunological indicators of HIV infection. Eighteen of 19 infected children tested positive by both PCR and culture, including six asymptomatic infants who were less than 10 weeks of age. As expected, p24 antigen capture assays were insensitive, detecting only 13 of the 19 infected children. One infected infant tested positive by PCR, but negative by culture and antigen. This infant was seropositive at 27 months and had pronounced hypergammaglobulinemia in association with non-specific symptoms. Twenty-four of the 43 infants were asymptomatic with normal immune profiles, declining antibody levels and no evidence of infection. These children tested repeatedly negative by PCR, culture, and p24 antigen assays. Our results indicate that DBS PCR is a sensitive, specific, and cost-effective alternative to viral culture for the early diagnosis (or exclusion) of perinatal HIV infection. DBS sampling opens the way for large-scale prospective studies to determine the exact rates of vertical HIV transmission in industrialized, as well as, nonindustrialized countries."

The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of genetic variation and circulation pattern of hMPV in Korea. Between January 2005 and April 2007, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 1,214 children <16 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection at Sanggyepaik Hospital. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for common respiratory pathogens using immunofluorescence or multiplex RT-PCR. RT-PCR was used to detect hMPV. The PCR products were purified and subsequently sequenced directly on both strands. hMPV was detected in 8.4% (102/1,214) of nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with acute respiratory tract infection. The 102 hMPV strains detected in this study were classified into two distinct F lineages, 87 strains belonged to genogroup A2 (A2a in 42, A2b in 45) and 15 strains to genogroup B. All hMPV subtypes except A1 co-circulated in Korean population. Although alternating predominance of hMPV subtypes from year to year could not be found, the changing predominance of sublineage A2a and A2b was demonstrated."
CD011926,0,10213292,0,The effect of primary cytomegalovirus infection on fetal lung maturity indices.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on fetal pulmonary surfactant production as assessed by different tests for the diagnosis of fetal lung maturity (FLM) on amniotic fluid (AF). A cross-sectional cohort study. AF samples from 11 pregnant women with primary CMV infection were examined for FLM between the 26th and 37th week of gestation. Normal pregnancies (n = 11) were matched for gestational age at amniocentesis and at delivery, birth weight, Apgar score and gender sex. FLM was assessed by planimetric and stoichiometric lecithin to sphingomyelin ratio (L/S), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) presence and lamellar bodies count (LB). Maternal immunological parameters (T-cells, natural killer [NK] activity) were also considered. Mean planimetric L/S ratio (4.2+/-2.1 vs 2.3+/-0.7, P < 0.01) and LB count (42.6 x 10(3)+/-19.0 x 10(3) vs 16.8 x 10(3)+/-11.5 x 10(3), P < 0.004) were higher in controls when compared to CMV infected patients. Moreover, planimetric L/S ratio was higher in five CMV non-infected babies compared to six CMV-infected babies (3.1+/-1.3 vs 1.9+/-0.8, P < 0.05). When FLM was related to maternal immunological results, planimetric and stoichiometric L/S and LBs count were negatively correlated with CD8+ T-cells (r = -0.8, P < 0.05; r = -0.9, P < 0.05; r = -0.9, P < 0.01, respectively); LBs was also negatively correlated with CD14+ T-cells (r = -0.8, P < 0.03). In contrast, a positive correlation was found between stoichiometric L/S and NK activity (r = 0.9, P > 0.01). Maternal primary CMV infection impairs FLM indices as a possible result of reduced surfactant release and/or production. Significant correlations were found between immunity status of CMV-infected mothers and FLM tests."
CD011926,0,21633509,0,Diversity of prophage DNA regions of Streptococcus agalactiae clonal lineages from adults and neonates with invasive infectious disease.,"The phylogenetic position and prophage DNA content of the genomes of 142 S. agalactiae (group-B streptococcus, GBS) isolates responsible for bacteremia and meningitis in adults and neonates were studied and compared. The distribution of the invasive isolates between the various serotypes, sequence types (STs) and clonal complexes (CCs) differed significantly between adult and neonatal isolates. Use of the neighbor-net algorithm with the PHI test revealed evidence for recombination in the population studied (PHI, P = 2.01 × 10(-6)), and the recombination-mutation ratio (R/M) was 6:7. Nevertheless, the estimated R/M ratio differed between CCs. Analysis of the prophage DNA regions of the genomes of the isolates assigned 90% of the isolates to five major prophage DNA groups: A to E. The mean number of prophage DNA fragments amplified per isolate varied from 2.6 for the isolates of prophage DNA group E to 4.0 for the isolates of prophage DNA group C. The isolates from adults and neonates with invasive diseases were distributed differently between the various prophage DNA groups (P < 0.00001). Group C prophage DNA fragments were found in 52% of adult invasive isolates, whereas 74% of neonatal invasive isolates had prophage DNA fragments of groups A and B. Differences in prophage DNA content were also found between serotypes, STs and CCs (P < 0.00001). All the ST-1 and CC1 isolates, mostly of serotype V, belonged to the prophage DNA group C, whereas 84% of the ST-17 and CC17 isolates, all of serotype III, belonged to prophage DNA groups A and B. These data indicate that the transduction mechanisms, i.e., gene transfer from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage, underlying genetic recombination in S. agalactiae species, are specific to each intraspecies lineage and population of strains responsible for invasive diseases in adults and neonates."
CD011926,0,24194936,0,Local IL-17A potentiates early neutrophil recruitment to the respiratory tract during severe RSV infection.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis triggers a strong innate immune response characterized by excessive neutrophil infiltration which contributes to RSV induced pathology. The cytokine IL-17A enhances neutrophil infiltration into virus infected lungs. IL-17A is however best known as an effector of adaptive immune responses. The role of IL-17A in early immune modulation in RSV infection is unknown. We aimed to elucidate whether local IL-17A facilitates the innate neutrophil infiltration into RSV infected lungs prior to adaptive immunity. To this end, we studied IL-17A production in newborns that were hospitalized for severe RSV bronchiolitis. In tracheal aspirates we measured IL-17A concentration and neutrophil counts. We utilized cultured human epithelial cells to test if IL-17A regulates RSV infection-induced IL-8 release as mediator of neutrophil recruitment. In mice we investigated the cell types that are responsible for early innate IL-17A production during RSV infection. Using IL-17A neutralizing antibodies we tested if IL-17A is responsible for innate neutrophil infiltration in mice. Our data show that increased IL-17A production in newborn RSV patient lungs correlates with subsequent neutrophil counts recruited to the lungs. IL-17A potentiates RSV-induced production of the neutrophil-attracting chemokine IL-8 by airway epithelial cells in vitro. Various lung-resident lymphocytes produced IL-17A during early RSV infection in Balb/c mice, of which a local population of CD4 T cells stood out as the predominant RSV-induced cell type. By removing IL-17A during early RSV infection in mice we showed that IL-17A is responsible for enhanced innate neutrophil infiltration in vivo. Using patient material, in vitro studies, and an animal model of RSV infection, we thus show that early local IL-17A production in the airways during RSV bronchiolitis facilitates neutrophil recruitment with pathologic consequences to infant lungs."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of two new commercial techniques available for the detection of hMPV in clinical samples from children: an enzyme immunoassay, hMPV EIA (Biotrin International Ltd), and a molecular assay, real-time RT-PCR (Pro hMPV Real Time Assay Kit; Prodesse). A total of 184 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 173 children aged less than 5 years who were hospitalized with acute wheezing were analysed. Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 27% of the samples, followed by influenza A virus (6%), parainfluenza virus (PIV)3 (2.2%), adenovirus (2%), PIV1 (1.1%), PIV2 (1.1%), and influenza B virus (0.5%). The presence of hMPV was tested in all samples, using the real-time RT-PCR and EIA. Real-time RT-PCR detected 13 hMPV-positive samples (8%), and EIA detected 17 (9.3%). When the EIA results were compared with those of real-time RT-PCR for the detection of hMPV, a good correlation was found (94%). A relatively low co-infection rate (15%) was observed in our patients. RT-PCR and EIA provide robust methods for the diagnosis of hMPV infection in children."
CD011926,0,8993862,0,Current methods of laboratory diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections.,"Infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis are probably the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. Commonly unrecognized and often inadequately treated, chlamydial infections can ascend the reproductive tract and cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which often results in the devastating consequences of infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or chronic pelvic pain. C. trachomatis infections are also known to increase the risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection. The obligate intracellular life cycle of C. trachomatis has traditionally required laboratory diagnostic tests that are technically demanding, labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to access. In spite of these historical challenges, however, laboratory diagnosis of C. trachomatis has been a rapidly advancing area in which there is presently a wide array of commercial diagnostic technologies, costs, manufacturers. This review describes and compares the diagnostic methods for C. trachomatis infection that are currently approved for use in the United States, including the newest DNA amplification technologies which are yet to be licensed for commercial use. Issues to consider in selecting a test for purposes of screening versus diagnosis based on prevalence, performance, legal, social, and cost issues are also discussed."

CD011926,0,26370110,0,Minimally Invasive Sampling Method Identifies Differences in Taxonomic Richness of Nasal Microbiomes in Young Infants Associated with Mode of Delivery.,"To date, there is a limited understanding of the role of the airway microbiome in the early life development of respiratory diseases such as asthma, partly due to a lack of simple and minimally invasive sample collection methods. In order to characterize the baseline microbiome of the upper respiratory tract (URT) in infants, a comparatively non-invasive method for sampling the URT microbiome suitable for use in infants was developed. Microbiome samples were collected by placing filter paper in the nostrils of 33 healthy, term infants enrolled as part of the Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure (INSPIRE) study. After bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from the filters, amplicons were generated with universal primers targeting the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. This method was capable of capturing a wide variety of taxa expected to inhabit the nasal cavity. Analyses stratifying subjects by demographic and environmental factors previously observed or predicted to influence microbial communities were performed. Microbial community richness was found to be higher in infants who had been delivered via Cesarean section and in those who had been formula-fed; an association was observed between diet and delivery, which confounds this analysis. We have established a baseline URT microbiome using a non-invasive filter paper nasal sampling for this population, and future studies will be performed in this large observational cohort of infants to investigate the relationship between viral infections, the URT microbiota, and the development of childhood wheezing illnesses."

CD011926,0,25412084,0,"Assessing positivity and circulating levels of NS1 in samples from a 2012 dengue outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","Dengue virus (DENV) represents a major threat to public health worldwide. Early DENV diagnosis should not only detect the infection but also identify patients with a higher likelihood to develop severe cases. Previous studies have suggested the potential for NS1 to serve as a viral marker for dengue severity. However, further studies using different sera panels are required to confirm this hypothesis. In this context, we developed a lab-based ELISA to detect and quantitate NS1 protein from the four DENV serotypes and from primary and secondary cases. This approach was used to calculate the circulating NS1 concentration in positive samples. We also tested the NS1 positivity of DENV-positive samples according to the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag assay. A total of 128 samples were positive for DENV infection and were classified according to the WHO guidelines. The overall NS1 positivity was 68% according to the Platelia assay, whereas all samples were NS1-positive when analyzed with our lab-based ELISA. Fifty-four samples were positive by PCR, revealing a co-circulation of DENV1 and DENV4, and the NS1 positivity for DENV4 samples was lower than that for DENV1. The circulating NS1 concentration ranged from 7 to 284 ng/mL. Our results support previous data indicating the low efficiency of the Platelia assay to detect DENV4 infection. Moreover, this work is the first to analyze NS1 antigenemia using retrospective samples from a Brazilian outbreak."
CD011926,0,18809546,0,Molecular detection methods and serotyping performed directly on clinical samples improve diagnostic sensitivity and reveal increased incidence of invasive disease by Streptococcus pneumoniae in Italian children.,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Italian children and perform serotyping by PCR-based assays directly on clinical samples. A 1-year paediatric (0-14 years) population-based surveillance study was designed to evaluate the incidence of IPD in the province of Florence, Italy, by cultural and molecular methods. Among 92 children (80 with pneumonia, 8 with meningitis/sepsis, 4 with arthritis), 4 cases of IPD were diagnosed both by culture and real-time PCR and 18 cases exclusively by molecular methods. The sensitivity of molecular methods was significantly higher than that of cultural methods (Cohen's kappa 0.41; McNemar P=0.000008). The incidence of IPD in children below 2 years of age was 11.5/100,000 and 51.8/100,000 by cultural and molecular methods, respectively. Pneumococcal serotyping by multiplex sequential PCR was obtained in 19/22 samples. Real-time PCR and multiplex sequential PCR can be used directly on biological samples, improving the ability to diagnose IPD. The incidence of IPD appears 5-10 times higher by PCR than by cultural methods."

Two genetic groups and four subgroups of hMPV have been described. They co-circulate during an epidemic in variable proportions. The aims were to characterize the genotypes of hMPV recovered from children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection and to establish the molecular epidemiology of strains circulating in Santiago of Chile during a 2-year period. The detection of the N gene by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was carried out for screening 545 infants hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection in Santiago during 2003-2004. The genetic typing of hMPV was performed by analyzing the fusion gene sequences. hMPV was detected in 10.2% (56/545 cases). Phylogenetic analysis of F gene sequences from 39 Chilean hMPV strains identified the two groups and four subgroups previously described. Strains clustered into group A were split further into the sub lineages A1, A2, and A3. Most Chilean strains clustered into the proposed novel A3 sub lineage (59%). A3 viruses were present in both years, while A1 and A2 circulated just in 1 year. In conclusion, hMPV is a relevant cause of acute lower respiratory infection in Chilean children and the potential novel cluster of group A emphasize the need for further regional genetic variability studies."

CD011926,0,21063809,0,Staphylococcal toxins in sudden unexpected death in infancy: experience from a single specialist centre.,"Around two thirds of sudden unexpected deaths in infancy (SUDI) remain unexplained following post-mortem examination. It has been postulated that a subset of unexplained SUDI may be caused by toxigenic Staphylococcus aureus. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of toxigenic S aureus strains in unexplained and explained SUDI (those in whom a cause of death is determined at autopsy). A retrospective review was performed of 546 SUDI autopsies as part of a larger review of >1,500 pediatric autopsies over a 10-year period, 1996-2005 inclusive. SUDI was defined as the sudden and unexpected death of an infant aged 7-365 days, and categorized into unexplained, explained with histological evidence of infection (bacterial infection group) or explained due to non-infective causes. Toxin gene profiling was carried out by PCR in cases in whom S aureus was isolated as part of clinical investigation. Of the 507 SUDI included in this analysis, bacteriological investigations were performed in 470, and S aureus was isolated on post-mortem culture from at least one site in 173 (37%). There were significantly more cases with S aureus isolated in unexplained SUDI (40%) compared to non-infective SUDI (21%; difference 19.0%, 95% CI 5.4% to 29.3%, P = 0.006). 46% of all cases with S aureus isolated underwent routine testing for a panel of staphylococcal toxin genes (including SEA to SEE, SEG to SEJ, TSST-1, and exfoliative toxins A and B). There were more cases with at least one toxigenic strain of S aureus in the unexplained SUDI (81%) and bacterial infection groups (77%) than in the non-infection group (63%), but these differences were not statistically significant (Fisher exact test, P = 0.44). Toxin gene-carrying S aureus is commonly detected at autopsy in SUDI, accounting for 78% of S aureus isolates submitted for toxin gene profiling in this series. There is a significantly higher prevalence of S aureus in unexplained SUDI compared to non-infective SUDI, but no significant difference in the proportion with toxigenic S aureus strains isolated between the groups. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a subset of otherwise unexplained SUDI may be related to the presence of S aureus colonization/infection, but do not indicate routine testing for toxin-associated genotypes."

However, there are limited data on the role of NoVs in neonatal infections and disease. The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence of NoVs in neonates with gastrointestinal disease using a case-control study design and to characterize the NoV strains infecting neonates. A total of 309 fecal samples from 161 neonates with gastrointestinal symptoms and 148 asymptomatic controls were screened for genogroup II (GII) NoV using reverse transcription-PCR. A subset of PCR-positive amplicons for the polymerase and capsid regions was sequenced. NoV was detected in 26.2% of samples, with the rate of detection being significantly higher among symptomatic neonates (60/161, 37.2%) than asymptomatic neonates (24/148, 14.1%) (P < 0.001). On the basis of sequencing of 29 strains, a single NoV strain, GIIb, was identified to be the predominant (27/29, 93.1%) cause of neonatal infections. Coinfection with rotavirus was seen in nearly one-third of symptomatic neonates. The study demonstrates a high prevalence of NoV infections in neonates and indicates that coinfection with rotavirus may result in significantly more gastrointestinal disease in this population."

CD011926,0,8702550,0,Identification of a family of streptococcal surface proteins with extremely repetitive structure.,"The group B Streptococcus (GBS) causes the majority of life-threatening bacterial infections in newborn children. Most GBS strains isolated from such infections express a surface protein, designated Rib, that confers protective immunity and therefore is of interest for analysis of pathogenetic mechanisms. Sequence analysis demonstrated that Rib has an exceptionally long signal peptide (55 amino acid residues) and 12 repeats (79 amino acid residues each) that account for >80% of the sequence of the mature protein. The repeats are identical even at the DNA level, indicating that an efficient mechanism operates to maintain a highly repetitive structure in Rib. The structure of Rib is similar to that of alpha, a previously characterized surface protein that is common among GBS strains lacking Rib. However, highly purified preparations of Rib and alpha did not cross-react immunologically, although the two proteins show extensive amino acid residue identity (47% in the repeat region). When analyzed in Western blots, Rib and alpha give rise to a regularly spaced ladder pattern, apparently due to hydrolysis of acid-labile Asp-Pro bonds in the repeats. We conclude that Rib and alpha are members of a novel family of streptococcal surface proteins with unusual repetitive structure."
CD011926,0,18417663,0,Accuracy and potential usefulness of triplex real-time PCR for improving antibiotic treatment of patients with blood cultures showing clustered gram-positive cocci on direct smears.,"Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing currently require 48 h when a first blood culture (BC) is positive for clustered gram-positive cocci on direct smear examination (DSE). Meanwhile, antibiotic treatment is often inadequate, reducing the chances of effective treatment or creating unnecessary selective pressure. A new real-time PCR (RT-PCR) technique that differentiates Staphylococcus aureus from coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and detects methicillin resistance in 90 min in BC bottles could help solve these problems. BC bottles from 410 patients with gram-positive cocci on DSE were processed by current methods, and patients' treatments were prospectively recorded. The RT-PCR assay was performed on aliquots of these BCs, which had been kept frozen. For the 121 patients who had true bacteremia, we established whether the faster availability of RT-PCR results could have led to the initiation of treatments different from those actually given. RT-PCR sensitivity and specificity were 100% for differentiating between S. aureus and CoNS and detecting methicillin resistance with two manufacturers' BC bottles. For 31/86 (36%) of the S. aureus-infected patients and for 8/35 (23%) of the CoNS-infected patients who either had suboptimal or nonoptimal treatment or were untreated 48 h after positivity was detected, the early availability of RT-PCR results could have allowed more effective treatment. Unnecessary glycopeptide treatments could have been avoided for 28 additional patients. The use of RT-PCR would increase treatment effectiveness in patients with staphylococcal bacteremia and reduce the selective pressure created by glycopeptides."

The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of HBoV, and other respiratory viral pathogens, in a 2-year retrospective study of children admitted to hospital, and to investigate whether viral loads of HBoV DNA were associated with severity of infection. Between April 2007 and March 2009, 891 respiratory samples from 760 children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infection were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses by real-time PCR or direct immunofluorescence testing. HBoV DNA was detected by using internally controlled real-time quantitative PCR assay and 25 samples selected at random were sequenced. The virus detected most frequently was rhinovirus, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, HBoV, and human metapneumovirus. HBoV DNA was detected in 18.4% of children admitted to hospital. HBoV was the only viral pathogen detected in 66/164 (40.2%) of HBoV DNA-positive children and in 7.4% of all 891 samples. Ninety-seven percent (64/66) of children with an HBoV single infection were diagnosed as having lower respiratory tract infection. Median HBoV DNA viral load was significantly higher in children when HBoV was detected as a single pathogen. Higher HBoV DNA viral loads were associated with prematurity and age. HBoV seems to be an important and frequent pathogen in respiratory tract infections in children, and it is likely that the severity of illness is comparable to the severity of RSV illness."

Cases were aged between 5 and 46 months, and were either a cousin or sibling of another case. All eight cases survived. Chemoprophylaxis was given to relevant nuclear family members and close contacts on each occasion, but failed to prevent further cases. Neisseria meningitidis isolates from six cases were highly related, belonging to the ST-41/44 clonal complex, and shared the porA designation 7–2,4. In November 2013, the outbreak control team recommended that directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis be administered simultaneously to the extended family, and that the four component meningococcal B (4CMenB) vaccine be administered to family members aged 2 months to 23 years inclusive and relevant close contacts of the eighth case. Subsequently these recommendations were implemented at three regional clinics. Additionally pharyngeal swabs (n=112) were collected to assess carriage rates of N. meningitidis in this extended family. Pharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis was detected in 15 (13%) family members. From the epidemiological investigation and carriage study overcrowding was the most likely risk factor identified in this outbreak. To date, the combination of directly observed ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis and use of 4CMenB vaccine have controlled the outbreak with no further cases diagnosed."

Four Spanish strains were included as controls of clonal diversity in molecular techniques. Antibiotype and plasmid profile was not useful as epidemiological tools. PFGE and REP-PCR were able to discriminate between Argentinean and Spanish isolates of Salmonella Infantis allowing to detect genetically related strains in three different cities. This finding indicates that a possible spread of a clone of this serovar in the North-eastern Region of Argentina has taken place in 1998."

CD011926,0,8487289,0,Typing of Listeria spp. by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis.,"Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, a variation of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in which a single primer is used, was evaluated for use as a simple and reliable method with which to type Listeria spp. Representatives of six species of Listeria were studied. Five isolates of L. innocua and four isolates of L. seeligeri were all distinguishable from one another, but the four isolates of L. ivanovii tested, although distinguishable from other Listeria spp., were not differentiated. Among L. monocytogenes serovars 1/2a (eight isolates), 1/2b (eight isolates) and 4b (10 isolates), at least six, three and six RAPD patterns were observed, respectively. Fourteen neonatal cross-infection sets of L. monocytogenes isolates, shown to be indistinguishable by serotyping and phage typing, were examined with three different primers. With one primer, three of the sets were shown to consist of closely related, but distinguishable, strains. In the other 11 cases, each set of strains was indistinguishable with all three primers. These preliminary data indicate that RAPD analysis has promise as a method for typing Listeria spp."
CD011926,0,25700890,0,Case-control comparison of bacterial and protozoan microorganisms associated with gastroenteritis: application of molecular detection.,"The introduction of molecular detection of infectious organisms has led to increased numbers of positive findings, as observed for pathogens causing gastroenteritis (GE). However, because little is known about the prevalence of these pathogens in the healthy asymptomatic population, the clinical value of these additional findings is unclear. A case-control study was carried out in a population of patients served by general practitioners in the Netherlands. A total of 2710 fecal samples from case and matched control subjects were subjected to multiplex real-time PCR for the 11 most common bacterial and four protozoal causes of GE. Of 1515 case samples, 818 (54%) were positive for one or more target organisms. A total of 49% of the controls were positive. Higher positivity rates in cases compared to controls were observed for Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Clostridium difficile, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli/Shigella spp., enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, and Giardia lamblia. However, Dientamoeba fragilis and Shiga-like toxigenic E. coli were detected significantly less frequent in cases than in controls, while no difference in prevalence was found for typical EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. The association between the presence of microorganisms and GE was the weakest in children aged 0 to 5 years. Higher relative loads in cases further support causality. This was seen for Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic E. coli, and C. parvum/hominis, and for certain age categories of those infected with C. difficile, enteroaggregative E. coli, and atypical EPEC. For D. fragilis and Shiga-like toxigenic E. coli/enterohemorrhagic E. coli, pathogen loads were lower in cases. Application of molecular diagnostics in GE is rapid, sensitive and specific, but results should be interpreted with care, using clinical and additional background information."

CD011926,0,11370250,0,Leishmaniasis in Sudan. Visceral leishmaniasis.,"From the early 1900s, visceral leishmaniasis (VL; kala-azar) has been among the most important health problems in Sudan, particularly in the main endemic area in the eastern and central regions. Several major epidemics have occurred, the most recent--in Western Upper Nile province in southern Sudan, detected in 1988--claiming over 100,000 lives. The disease spread to other areas that were previously not known to be endemic for VL. A major upsurge in the number of cases was noted in the endemic area. These events triggered renewed interest in the disease. Epidemiological and entomological studies confirmed Phlebotomus orientalis as the vector in several parts of the country, typically associated with Acacia seyal and Balanites aegyptiaca vegetation. Infection rates with Leishmania were high, but subject to seasonal variation, as were the numbers of sand flies. Parasites isolated from humans and sand flies belonged to three zymodemes (MON-18, MON-30 and MON-82), which all belong to the L. donovani sensu lato cluster. Transmission dynamics have not been elucidated fully; heavy transmission in relatively scarcely populated areas such as Dinder national park suggested zoonotic transmission whereas the large numbers of patients with post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) in heavily affected villages may indicate a human reservoir and anthroponotic transmission. Clinical presentation in adults and in children did not differ significantly, except that children were more anaemic. Fever, weight loss, hepato-splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy were the most common findings. PKDL was much more common than expected (56% of patients with VL developed PKDL), but other post-VL manifestations were also found affecting the eyes (uveitis, conjunctivitis, blepharitis), nasal and/or oral mucosa. Evaluation of diagnostic methods showed that parasitological diagnosis should still be the mainstay in diagnosis, with sensitivities for lymph node, bone marrow and spleen aspirates of 58%, 70% and 96%, respectively. Simple, cheap serological tests are needed. The direct agglutination test (DAT) had a sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 94%, positive predictive value of 78% and negative predictive value of 92%. As with other serological tests, the DAT cannot distinguish between active disease, subclinical infection or past infection. The introduction of freeze-dried antigen and control sera greatly improved the practicality and accuracy of the DAT in the field. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant K39 antigen had higher sensitivity than DAT (93%). The polymerase chain reaction using peripheral blood gave a sensitivity of 70-93% and was more sensitive than microscopy of lymph node or bone marrow aspirates in patients with suspected VL. The leishmanin skin test (LST) was typically negative during active VL and converted to positive in c. 80% of patients 6 months after treatment. Immunological studies showed that both Th1 and Th2 cell responses could be demonstrated in lymph nodes from VL patients as evidenced by the presence of messenger ribonucleic acid for interleukin (IL)-10, interferon gamma and IL-2. Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from VL patients with IL-12 was found to drive the immune response toward a Th1 type response with the production of interferon gamma, indicating a potential therapeutic role for IL-12. VL responded well to treatment with sodium stibogluconate, which is still the first line drug at a dose of 20 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly per day for 15-30 d. Side effects and resistance were rare. Liposomal amphotericin B was effective, with few side effects. Control measures have not been implemented. Based on observations that VL does not occur in individuals who have a positive LST, probably because of previous cutaneous leishmaniasis, a vaccine containing heat-killed L. major promastigotes is currently undergoing a phase III trial."
CD011926,0,22385011,0,Respiratory viral infections during the first 28 days after transplantation in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.,"Respiratory viruses (RVs) are a known cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this retrospective study, we focused on the first 28 d after transplantation in pediatric HSCT recipients and showed that a multiplex PCR assay significantly increased RV detection compared with a viral culture method. Among 176 pediatric HSCT recipients, 84 with respiratory symptoms within one yr after HSCT were tested by viral culture or multiplex PCR. Within 28 d after HSCT, nine patients were infected with RVs; the incidence of a first episode of RV infection within 28 d after HSCT was 5.1%. Eight patients recovered without complications. However, one patient died of adenovirus (AdV) pneumonia with pulmonary hemorrhage; the mortality rate of RV infection within 28 d after HSCT was 0.57%. In the nine patients with RV infection, five different types of RV were identified, either alone or with another RV. These were corona virus (CoV), rhinovirus (RhV) and respiratory syncytial virus combined with CoV; AdV combined with RhV; and parainfluenza virus. Viral culture detected only one case of RV infection, while multiplex PCR detected eight, suggesting that screening of respiratory infections using multiplex PCR is better than the conventional culture method."

Her mother had been diagnosed with mumps 4 weeks and 5 days prior to delivery. Mumps IgM antibody was elevated in the neonate and mumps virus ribonucleic acid was detected in the umbilical cord blood by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The perinatal virus infection was complicated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and pulmonary hemorrhage. Successful treatment included the use of high frequency oscillation ventilation together with the administration of artificial surfactant.
CD011926,0,8038116,0,Comparison of different methods for CMV detection.,"The submandibular glands were investigated in 77 cases of SIDS using histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH) and PCR to detect cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusion disease. The aim of the investigation was to establish the detection of CMV by PCR as a model for the detection of other types of virus by PCR, especially for the detection of viruses which affect the respiratory system of babies. In 14 cases the CMV detection was possible. Typical changes of duct cells associated with CMV infection were observed in 9 by histology and in 4 further cases by IHC. In comparison to these methods, ISH showed a higher sensitivity but only one more positive case was found. Theoretically the PCR method is more sensitive than ISH and more convenient from the practical aspect. Detection of CMV by PCR was possible in 10 out of 14 positive cases. All PCR positive cases were cases showing an active disease but not latent infection."
CD011926,0,12424579,0,Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised children.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious life-threatening complication in immunocompromised children. The commonest risk groups are children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, leukaemia, corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive therapy, chronic granulomatous disease and severe combined immunodeficiency as well as neonates. The clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and many organ systems can be involved. Diagnosis based on the clinical presentation alone is cumbersome. Innovative and sensitive laboratory test systems which detect fungal antigens or DNA in clinical specimens have been recently developed. Specific Aspergillus antibody detection using recombinant antigen technique has also been introduced. Although each individual technique has drawbacks, the combined use of culture with antigen and antibody ELISA as well as PCR should result in an earlier and more definitive diagnosis of IA in children presenting with clinical and/or radiological signs of aspergillosis. In high risk children these methods are valuable for serial screening and early detection of Aspergillus infection. The implementation of accurate diagnostic criteria and standardised diagnostic flow charts in children at risk will lead to a better outcome of IA in the future."
CD011926,0,25850250,0,[The detection of strains of Esherichia coll producing Shiga toxin in populations of normal intestinal microbiota in children with functional disorders of gastrointestinal tract].,"In intestinal ecosystem, interchange of genetic material between different types of bacteria and other representatives of family Enterobacteriaceae results in development of types of normal colibacillus with genetic characteristics of pathogenicity. This occurrence can be considered as a theoretical substantiation for labeling such strains as pathobionts. The polymerase chain reaction was implemented to analyze 96 strains of different types of Escherichia coli (with normal and weak zymogenic activity and hemolytic activity) isolated from children with functional disorders of gastrointestinal tract. The purpose was to detect presence of gens coding capacity of toxin production (six1, stx2). In intestinal biotope of children, circulation of strains of Escherichia coli producing shiga toxin having no relation to pathogenic group being representatives of normal indigenous microbiota. The presence of gens stx1 and stx2 in various biochemical types of Escherichia coli permits establishing fact of forming of reservoir of potential pathogenicity in non-pathogenic forms of Escherichia coli. The presence of gen (verotoxin 1) in genome of various types of Escherichia coli isolated from one single biotope testifies possible horizontal transmission of factors of pathogenicity in intestinal biotope."

CD011926,0,20977540,0,Molecular analysis of community-acquired methicillin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from bacteraemic and osteomyelitis infections in children from Tunisia.,"Thirty-six children (27 boys, nine girls) that fulfilled CDC criteria for community-acquired infections were diagnosed with bacteraemia and/or osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus during an 18-month period (2006-2008). Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by an agar dilution method. SCCmec type, carriage of pvl genes, agr type and spa-typing were determined using specific PCR protocols. Clonal relatedness was examined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis-SmaI and mutilocus sequence typing techniques. From the 36 isolates, eight (22%) corresponded to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) -t044/042-CC80/CC5-IVc-pvl(+) -agrIII/II. The highest genetic diversity was observed among the 28 community-acquired methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (CA-MSSA) isolates: 22 spa-variants that also grouped by multilocus sequence typing in CC1, CC5, CC6, CC8, CC30, CC80, CC97 and the singletons ST464, ST1467, ST1468 and ST1469. The pvl genes were detected in all eight CA-MRSA isolates and in eight CA-MSSA isolates (28%), being significantly more frequent among isolates causing osteoarticular infection (11 of 12, 92%) than in the bacteraemic isolates (six of 24, 25%). Based on patients' age, three groups were considered: newborns, infants and children. Bacteraemia was diagnosed in all newborns and infants, whereas in 42% of the children group osteomyelitis was the unique presentation. In most cases, the portal of entry was either the skin or unknown. In general, favourable outcome was observed, except in four cases-three of whom had severe complications and one died. In summary, we analysed the epidemiological and genetic background of community-acquired staphylococcal strains causing bacteraemic and/or osteomyelitis infections in children from Tunisia, describing three new sequence types and one novel spa type."
CD011926,0,8389398,0,A polymerase chain reaction assay of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with suspected herpes simplex encephalitis.,"A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect herpes simplex virus (HSV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in CSF of 109 patients with possible herpes simplex encephalitis. HSV DNA was found in 20/109 patients. In 14 of these patients the diagnosis was confirmed by a rise in CSF antibodies, isolation of HSV from the brain, or both. In 3 patients CSF antibodies did not rise and 3 patients did not have a follow up lumbar puncture or a brain biopsy. In 19/20 patients HSV DNA was present in the first CSF specimen. The virus was identified as HSV I in 15 patients and HSV II in 4; the virus was not typed in the other patient. A possible diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis was not confirmed in the 89 PCR-negative patients. HSV DNA was present in CSF of 3 patients who had meningitis with herpetic genital infections but it was not found in 24 patients with other neurological diseases. The results suggest that the detection of HSV DNA in CSF using a PCR assay will be an accurate method of early diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis."
CD011926,0,9688302,0,Deleted HTLV-1 provirus in cord-blood samples of babies born to HTLV-1-carrier mothers.,"We screened 596 cord-blood samples by nested short PCRs for the gag and pX regions of HTLV-1 which are capable of detecting a single copy. The samples were derived from 449 and 147 babies born to seropositive and seronegative mothers respectively. Of these, 20 samples were positive in at least one of the PCRs: 9 (45%) were positive in both PCRs, but 10 and 1 samples in either the pX or the gag PCR respectively. These samples were tested further in nested long PCRs directed for gag-pX, gag-pol and pol-pX regions capable of detecting 8, 1 and 2 copies respectively. Of 9 dually positive samples, 7 (77%) showed the predicted 6.2-kbp band in the gag-pX PCR; only 2 of them had the predicted band alone; 7 samples had discrete bands shorter than the predicted size. In the gag-pol PCR, all 9 samples showed the predicted 2.2-kbp band alone. In the pol-pX PCR, 819 samples showed the predicted 4.2-kbp band, including one with an additional 2.1-kbp band, and the last a 1.0-kbp band alone. Thus, all of the dually positive samples had proviruses harboring gag, pol and pX priming sites. In contrast, none of the 11 singly positive samples showed the predicted band in the gag-pX PCR: 5 had no visible band, and the other 6 had shorter bands only. None of these 11 samples showed any positive signal in either gag-pol or pol-pX PCR. Our results suggest that HTLV-1 proviruses in the cord blood are frequently defective."

CD011926,0,24321520,0,Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA sequences in peripheral blood and tissues from patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis.,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a group of granulomatous disorders in which abnormal Langerhans cells proliferate as either a localized lesion in a single bone or disseminated disease involving two or more organs or systems. Because the different LCH forms exhibit significantly elevated levels of inflammatory molecules, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and tissue-degrading enzymes, we investigated for a possible viral trigger in LCH pathogenesis. We looked for Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) in peripheral blood cells and tissues using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry staining with anti-MCPyV large T-antigen antibody. Our findings revealed elevated amounts of MCPyV DNA in the peripheral blood cells of 2 of 3 patients affected by LCH with high-risk organ involvement (RO+) and absence of MCPyV DNA in the blood cells in all 12 LCH-RO- patients (P = .029). With lower viral loads (0.002-0.033 copies/cell), an elevated number of MCPyV DNA sequences was detected in 12 LCH tissues in comparison with control tissues obtained from patients with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (0/5; P = .0007), skin diseases not related to LCH in children younger than 2 years (0/11; P = .0007), or dermatopathic lymphadenopathy (5/20; P = .0002). The data, including frequent but lower viral loads and low large-T antigen expression rate (2/13 LCH tissues), suggest that development of LCH as a reactive rather than a neoplastic process may be related to MCPyV infection."

Bordetella pertussis was isolated on cultures of two cases (3%) and the same specimens were found positive by DFA. Direct PCR results of nasopharyngeal samples were not evaluated since false positive reactions were obtained with one or more negative controls in different series. Since a symptomatic contact of any culture proven case is also defined as confirmed case by the standard case definitions, three of 66 cases (4.5%) together with a symptomatic contact of one of the culture positives were classified as confirmed pertussis in this study."

Because children infected with T. cruzi are usually asymptomatic, a study was designed including infected mothers and their children. The study was conducted for three years to establish diagnostic, treatment, and clinical observations variables. Mothers were tested for T. cruzi IgG, and the new born were examined for parasite DNA using PCR amplification. They were treated with nifurtimox and it was 100% effective, confirmed by successive PCR tests. It has been determined that there are 800 to 1000 new cases a year of transplacental Chagas' disease in Chile.

Low and high levels of genotypic resistance were assessed by differential hybridization, oligoligation, or direct sequencing of plasma HIV-1 RNA for codons K70R and T215Y/F. None of the women had high-level genotypic resistance to zidovudine at study entry or delivery. For low-level zidovudine resistance, the 95% confidence intervals were 0.3%-6.8% for baseline prevalence and 0.3%-14% for delivery incidence. Low-level zidovudine resistance, adjusted for plasma viral RNA level at delivery, was not strongly associated with an increase in vertical transmission risk (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-131; P = .35)."
CD011926,0,23399425,0,Low and decreasing vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H3) in 2011/12 among vaccination target groups in Europe: results from the I-MOVE multicentre case-control study.,"Within the Influenza Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness in Europe (I-MOVE) project we conducted a multicentre case–control study in eight European Union (EU) Member States to estimate the 2011/12 influenza vaccine effectiveness against medically attended influenza-like illness (ILI) laboratory-confirmed as influenza A(H3) among the vaccination target groups. Practitioners systematically selected ILI / acute respiratory infection patients to swab within seven days of symptom onset. We restricted the study population to those meeting the EU ILI case definition and compared influenza A(H3) positive to influenza laboratory-negative patients. We used logistic regression with study site as fixed effect and calculated adjusted influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE), controlling for potential confounders (age group, sex, month of symptom onset, chronic diseases and related hospitalisations, number of practitioner visits in the previous year). Adjusted IVE was 25% (95% confidence intervals (CI): -6 to 47) among all ages (n=1,014), 63% (95% CI: 26 to 82) in adults aged between 15 and 59 years and 15% (95% CI: -33 to 46) among those aged 60 years and above. Adjusted IVE was 38% (95%CI: -8 to 65) in the early influenza season (up to week 6 of 2012) and -1% (95% CI: -60 to 37) in the late phase. The results suggested a low adjusted IVE in 2011/12. The lower IVE in the late season could be due to virus changes through the season or waning immunity. Virological surveillance should be enhanced to quantify change over time and understand its relation with duration of immunological protection. Seasonal influenza vaccines should be improved to achieve acceptable levels of protection."

We have compared the sensitivity and capacity of a battery of T. cruzi PCR primers to detect the complete spectrum of known T. cruzi lineages, in order to improve and simplify the detection of infection in neonatal blood. We found that the primers Tcz1/Tcz2, targeting the 195 bp satellite repeat, detected all the parasitic lineages with the same sensitivity For all other tested primers (nDNA primers: BP1/BP2, 01/02, Pon1/ Pon2 and Tca1/Tca2; kDNA primers: S35VS36, 121/122), either, the intensity of amplicons varied according to T. cruzi lineages, or the assess were less sensitive. In order to better assess such PCR protocol, we assayed 311 samples of neonatal blood previously tested with parasitological methods. Reliability of our PCR test was demonstrated since all the 18 blood samples from newborns with congenital T. cruzi infection were positive, whereas the remaining samples (30 from control newborns of uninfected mothers and 262 out of 263 from babies, parasitologically negative, born from infected mothers) were negative. As our PCR method is simple, reliable, robust and cheap, it appears suitable for the detection of T. cruzi infection in neonatal blood."

Only 9% of subjects had Gag- or RT-specific CTL in unstimulated PBMC. However, in PBMC studied after CD3 stimulation, Gag- and Env-specific CTL were found in PBMC from 91% and 78% of HIV-infected children, respectively. Limiting dilution analysis of precursor CTL (pCTL) frequencies in PBMC from children > 12 months old demonstrated Gag- and Env-specific pCTL frequencies from 0.5 to 6.3/10,000 PBMC and from 0.66 to 33.0/10,000 PBMC, respectively.

Most cases of neonatal HSV disease are caused by HSV type 2, whereas virtually all cases of HSE are caused by HSV type 1. Diagnostic advances made during the past decade include the application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected HSV CNS disease to evaluate for the presence of HSV DNA. Although not foolproof, PCR is a powerful diagnostic tool that has supplanted brain biopsy as the modality of choice for diagnosing HSV CNS disease, in no small part because of the invasiveness of brain biopsy. PCR also can provide information regarding the therapeutic response to antiviral therapy. Efforts made during the past decade to improve the outcome of HSV CNS disease have focused on increased doses of intravenous acyclovir administered for longer durations of time. Although advances have been achieved, morbidity and mortality rates from neonatal HSV disease and HSE remain unacceptably high."

CD011926,0,10230418,0,[Problems of congenital toxoplasmosis. Evolution over four decades].,"EFFECT OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES: The development of reliable routine serology tests and the demonstration of the high prevalence of toxoplasmosis in France led to mandatory prospective screening of pregnant women in 1978, followed by prenatal screening in 1985. In addition, in utero diagnosis, first on fetal blood and now with the reliable and safe method using polymerase chain reaction on amniotic fluid, formally identifies the parasite. THE SITUATION TODAY: A comparison of the experience of a specialized center in Paris during three different periods over the last 40 years showed that currently 71% of all cases of congenital toxoplasmosis are infraclinical at birth and only 5% are severe. Mean incidence of seroconversion during pregnancy is 1.48%, with a 40% risk of fetal contamination if no treatment is given. The risk of overt fetopathy predominantly concerns maternal infections occurring prior to 26 weeks gestation. IN UTERO TREATMENT: Positive PCR diagnosis on amniotic fluid imposes serial ultrasound examinations to identify any fetopathy and an in utero treatment by giving the mother the pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine combination. Biological results are favorable. POST-NATAL TREATMENT: Post-natal treatment is indicated even in latent forms and should be continued for the first year of life. The pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine combination is the only pharmaceutical regimen with well-proven efficacy. New compounds should allow better prophylaxis against maternofetal contamination or improved post-natal treatment. RECURRENCE: In 70% of the cases, serology tests become positive again, but are not associated with significantly increased risk of ocular recurrence."

We determined the frequencies and clinical features of hMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in 374 Danish children with 383 episodes of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI). Study material comprised routine nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained during 2 winter seasons (November-May) 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 from children hospitalized at the Departments of Paediatrics, Hvidovre Hospital and Amager Hospital, Denmark. hMPV was detected in 11 (2.9%) and RSV in 190 (49.6%) ARTI episodes by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers targeting the hMPV N gene and the RSV L gene. Two children were co-infected with hMPV and RSV. They were excluded from statistical analysis. Hospitalization for ARTI caused by hMPV was restricted to very young children 1-6 months of age. Asthmatic bronchitis was diagnosed in 66.7% of hMPV and 10.6% of RSV-infected children (p < 0.001). Overall symptoms and clinical findings were similar among hMPV and RSV positive episodes, but more RSV-infected children required respiratory support. hMPV is present in young Danish children hospitalized with ARTI although less frequent than RSV and with a tendency to a milder clinical course."

HSV and/or CMV were detected by two laboratory methods in 57 examined children (51%). Of these, in 18 children (16.2%) both HSV and CMV were detected. The coincidence of the results of the detection of HSV and CMV by these two methods was observed in 72.4% and 75.2% of cases respectively. The comparative analysis of the detection of anti-CMV IgG and IgM was made with the use of commercial test systems produced bythe following manufacturers: ""Vector-Best"" and ""Bioservice"" (Russia), ""HUMAN"" and ""Boehringer"" (Germany). The effective detection of both anti-CMV (IgG and IgM) was ensured by the test systems ""Boehringer"". The test system ""Vector-Best"" for anti-CMV IgG proved to be not inferior as regards sensitivity and specificity. The German test systems demonstrated the highest specificity in the detection of low-avid antibodies. The data obtained in this study indicate that the detection rate of HSV and CMV markers in newborns and infants suspected for herpesvirus infection was, on the average, 20 - 40%. Reliable diagnostics in newborns and infants is possible only in the presence of the combination of at least 2 serological tests (the determination of antivirus IgM and IgG avidity) and 2 methods for the detection of direct herpesvirus markers (PCR and RCM)."

At present, different PCR-based methods for EV RNA detection are available, but comparisons of results obtained according to the different approaches are limited. We evaluated an in-house real-time RT-PCR assay with a commercialized TaqMan real-time RT-PCR kit for detection of EV. Consecutive clinical specimens from paediatric patients less than 6 years old with clinical suspicion of EV infection were analyzed between July and November 2010. After RNA extraction, samples were amplified both by the real-time RT-PCR commercial assay and the in-house assay. A total of 19 of 132 patients (14.4%) involving 20 samples (14 plasma samples and 6 CSF) were positive in at least one of the two assays.

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HAstV infection in Brazilian children under 5 years of age with AD, investigate the presence of recently described HAstV strains, through extensive laboratory-based surveillance of enteric viral agents in three Brazilian coastal regions between 2005 and 2011. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the overall HAstV detection rate reached 7.1% (207/2.913) with percentage varying according to the geographic region: 3.9% (36/921) in the northeast, 7.9% in the south (71/903) and 9.2% in the southeast (100/1.089) (p < 0.001). HAstV were detected in cases of all age groups. Detection rates were slightly higher during the spring. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 320-bp ORF2 fragment revealed that HAstV-1 was the predominant genotype throughout the seven years of the study. The novel AstV-MLB1 was detected in two children with AD from a subset of 200 samples tested, demonstrating the circulation of this virus both the in northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil. These results provide additional epidemiological and molecular data on HAstV circulation in three Brazilian coastal regions, highlighting its potential to cause infantile AD."
CD011926,0,21347890,0,Effectiveness of a PMTCT programme in rural Western Kenya.,"We assess the coverage of a Prevention of Mother-to-child Transmission (PMTCT) programme in Busia (Kenya) from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008 and estimate the risk of transmission of HIV. We also estimate the odds of HIV transmission according to pharmacological intervention received. Programme coverage was estimated as the proportion of mother-baby pairs receiving any antiretroviral (ARV) regimen among all HIV-positive women attending services. We estimated the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate and their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) using the direct method of calculation (intermediate estimate). A case-control study was established among all children born to HIV-positive mothers with information on outcome (HIV status of the babies) and exposure (data on pharmacological intervention). Cases were all HIV-positive children and controls were the HIV-negative ones. Exposure was defined as: (1) complete protocol: ARV prescribed according World Health Organisation recommendations; (2) partial protocol: does not meet criteria for complete protocol; and (3) no intervention: ARVs were not prescribed to both mother and child. Babies were tested using DNA Polymerase Chain Reaction at six weeks of life and six weeks after breastfeeding ceased. In the study period, 22,566 women accepted testing, 1668 were HIV positive (7.4%; 95%CI 7.05-7.73); 1036 (62%) registered in the programme and 632 were lost. Programme coverage was 40.4% (95%CI 37.9-42.7). Out of the 767 newborns, 28 (3.6%) died, 148 (19.3%) defaulted, 282 (36.7%) were administratively censored and 309 (40.2%) babies completed the follow-up as per protocol; 49 were HIV positive and MTCT risk was 15.86% (95%CI 11.6-20.1). The odds of having an HIV-positive baby was 4.6 times higher among pairs receiving a partial protocol compared to those receiving a complete protocol and 43 times higher among those receiving no intervention. Our data show a good level of enrolment but low global coverage rate. It demonstrates that ARV regimens can be implemented in low resource rural settings with marked decreases of MTCT. Increasing the coverage of PMTCT programmes remains the main challenge."
CD011926,0,15474777,0,Unsuspected neonatal killers in emergency medicine.,"A neonate presenting to the emergency department can present a challenge to even the most experienced clinician. This article has focused on four deceiving and potentially devastating neonatal diseases. 1. Neonatal herpes is a potentially devastating illness without pathognomonic signs or symptoms. Early recognition and therapy can reduce mortality markedly. Although no specific sign or symptom is diagnostic,the diagnosis should be strongly considered in the presence of HSV risk factors, atypical sepsis, unexplained acute hepatitis, or focal seizure activity. Acyclovir therapy should be initiated before viral dissemination or significant CNS replication occurs. 2. Pertussis is a disease in which infants are at greatest risk of death or severe complication. Neonatal pertussis often presents in an atypical manner, lacking the classic signs and symptoms such as the ""whoop.""More common signs and symptoms include cough, feeding difficulty,low-grade fever, emesis, increasing respiratory distress, apnea, cyanosis,and seizures. Management should include hospitalization, supportive care, and antibiotics. 3. Congenital heart defects, particularly ductal-dependent lesions, may have an initial asymptomatic period that culminates in a rapidly progressive and fatal course. A neonate with CHD presents with shock refractory to volume resuscitation or pressor support. Resuscitative efforts are ineffective unless PGE, is administered. 4. Inborn errors of metabolism often are unsuspected because of their protean and heterogeneous nature. Signs and symptoms are subtle,are nonspecific, and often mimic other, more common diseases.An elevated index of suspicion, along with application and correct interpretation of a select few laboratory tests, is the key to making a diagnosis. Therapy is relatively straightforward and focused on resuscitation followed by prevention of catabolism and correction of specifically identified abnormalities. Although these disorders are relatively uncommon, prompt diagnosis and therapy can lead to a decrease in morbidity and mortality. The key is to maintain a high index of suspicion."

In 2005, an outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred in Seoul, Korea, which appeared to be caused by certain enterovirus strains. This study analyzed the clinical isolates from 24 different aseptic meningitis patients at our center from January to September 2005. Serotyping using type-specific antisera, RT-PCR, and direct sequencing of the 5' noncoding and VP1 regions were carried out. The serotyping study identified 15 coxsackievirus B5 (CBV5), 4 coxsackievirus B1 (CBV1), 1 coxsackievirus B3 (CBV3) and 4 echovirus 9 (ECV9). Phylogenic analysis of the VP1 region revealed CBV5 to be the most predominant strain (15 strains). Twelve of these strains were grouped together with recent strains isolated in China and France. The 12 CBV5 strains contained a novel amino acid change in the BC-loop (the 90th and 91st, AY --> GN) compared to the reference strain (1954/UK/85). The amino acid changes in the BC-loop in some recent CBV5 strains tend to be located in the C-terminal part, and these changes suggest some antigenic significance."

A selection of 36 epidemiologically related and 8 epidemiologically unrelated isolates was analyzed. Among the epidemiologically related isolates, PFGE identified five genetically unrelated patterns. Thirty-two isolates from patients and wet nurses showed the same PFGE profile (pattern A). Genetically unrelated PFGE patterns were found in one patient (pattern B), in two wet nurses (patterns C and D), and in an environmental isolate from the NICU (pattern G). Rep-PCR identified seven different patterns, three of which included the 32 isolates of PFGE type A. One or two band differences in isolates of these three types allowed isolates to be categorized as similar and included in a unique cluster. Isolates of different PFGE types were also of unrelated rep-PCR types. All of the epidemiologically unrelated isolates were of different PFGE and rep-PCR types. The level of discrimination exhibited by rep-PCR with the DiversiLab system allowed us to conclude that this method was able to identify genetic similarity in a spatio-temporal cluster of S. marcescens isolates."

We became aware that Birmingham Health Authority was not being informed about certain patients on whom meningococcal PCR had been performed. To establish whether notification was overlooked in some patients with suspected meningococcal disease, or whether PCR was performed on patients in whom it was thought meningococcal disease was unlikely, we compared numbers of patients notified to us over six months who had PCR with numbers of patients not notified who had PCR. Between 1st August 1999 and 31st January 2000, 54 PCR requests were made on seventy-seven notified patients; 51 PCR requests were made on non-notified patients and none were positive. Median age and length of stay were shorter in the non-notified patients. We conclude: (i) PCR may be being used inappropriately on younger patients who have shorter admissions and are unlikely to have meningococcal disease; (ii) in a number of patients initially admitted and notified with meningococcal disease the diagnosis is subsequently reconsidered. A 'denotification' procedure for such patients could make information on meningococcal disease more reliable."

In this study, the correlation between maternal and neonatal serum anti-CMV IgG levels and risk of postnatal CMV transmission in preterm infants was assessed. Anti-CMV IgG levels of 79 CMV seropositive mothers and their 94 infants were determined in peripheral blood samples collected within 3 days after delivery. Postnatal CMV infection was detected in 39/94 (41%) infants by PCR on urine at term-equivalent age (gestational age 40 weeks) after congenital infection was excluded. Maternal or infant anti-CMV IgG levels were not significantly different between infants with and without postnatal CMV infection. The anti-CMV IgG infant-mother ratio showed a significant positive correlation with gestational age (range 25-32 weeks, R(2)  = 0.218, P < 0.001), reaching 1.0 at 32 weeks of gestation. Anti-CMV IgG infant-mother ratio was significantly lower in infants with postnatal CMV infection (P = 0.015). In conclusion, the risk of postnatal CMV transmission is related to low gestational age and low anti-CMV IgG infant-mother ratio."

CD011926,0,19284162,0,Molecular detection of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli isolates in stool samples from patients with diarrhea.,"Despite its occurence as a commensal in the human intestine, Escherichia coli is also known as a versatile gastrointestinal pathogen. Identification of diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) requires the accurate discrimination of pathogenic strains from commensal flora, and this is not an easy task if the diagnostic tools are inadequate. As the information regarding the relative contribution of DEC among other identifiable causes of infectious diarrhea in Romanian patients is scarce, a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) isolates in the diarrheagenic stool specimens of 120 children and 270 adults. PCR-based detection of the eae, bfp, vtx1 and vtx2 genes was added to the conventional culture and slide agglutination with 12 commercial EPEC antisera and O157:H7 antisera for identifying EPEC and VTEC isolates. Even though E. coli colonies belonging to traditional EPEC serogroups were isolated from 35 children and 17 adults, only the isolates recovered from 16 children and 2 adults harboured at least one of the targeted pathogenicity-associated genes. The children shedding EPEC outnumbered the adults (16.7% vs. 7.4%). Based on the virulence genotype identified, the prevalence of atypical EPEC (eae+) was higher than of typical EPEC (eae+ bfpA+), and typical EPEC identification was restricted to children. Owing to the molecular analysis 5 children and 10 adults that could have been overlooked by the routine microbiological investigation were diagnosed as infected with VTEC. Considering that none of the screened stool specimens was positive for E. coli O157:H7, this study reports for the first time the presence of VTEC nonO157 in local patients with diarrhea. Our results bring evidence that both EPEC and VTEC isolates are circulating as agents of local sporadic cases of human diarrhea. Further studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of DEC to the human disease burden in Romania, based on improved diagnostic tools targeting the main virulence traits of E. coli clinical isolates."
CD011926,0,17366056,0,Respiratory picornavirus infections in Korean children with lower respiratory tract infections.,"Recently, human rhinoviruses (RVs) and enteroviruses have been suggested as important etiological agents in young children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). We investigated the role of respiratory picornaviruses in hospitalized children with LRTI. A total of 233 nasopharyngeal samples were collected from hospitalized children with LRTIs from July 2004 to January 2006. All specimens were tested for the presence of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), influenza virus A, influenza B, parainfluenzavirus, and adenovirus using direct immunofluorescent assay, and for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) by RT-PCR. Detection of RV was performed in nasopharyngeal samples by a RT-PCR assay that incorporated a BglI restriction enzyme digestion of the picornavirus RT-PCR amplicon, and detection of enterovirus was accomplished by hemi-nested RT-PCR using specific primers. Viral agents were detected in 70.4% (164/233) of the study population. The most frequently detected viruses were RV (64/233, 27.4%), hRSV (48/233, 20.6%), and enterovirus (43/233, 18.4%). Picornaviruses were detected as the sole viral agents in 27.0% (63/233) of children, whereas mixed viral infection was detected in 12.0%. These results suggest that picronavirus infection is an important etiological cause of LRTIs in Korean children."

The study aimed at the detection of NNRTI drug resistance mutations arising as a result of SD-NVP. A total of 19 and 13 samples collected at 48 h and 2 months postpartum, respectively, from infants that were given SD-NVP were studied for the presence of NNRTI drug resistance mutations by PCR amplification and sequencing of the HIV-1 pol gene using HIV proviral DNA.

Mutations associated with NNRTI drug resistance were observed in two (10.5%) and six (46.15%) samples at 48 h and at 2 months, respectively. K103N, one of the most common mutations, was not observed in any of the samples. The emergence of NVP resistance must be weighed against the simplicity, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of SD-NVP prophylaxis in PMTCT settings in developing countries."

Infants were assessed clinically and HIV isolation, HIV p24 antigen, polymerase chain reaction and total serum immunoglobulin determinations were performed. Four infants were infected. HIV isolation, HIV p24 antigen and polymerase chain reaction were positive within 3 months in all infected infants (100% sensitivity). False positive rates for a single test were 18, 9 and 9%, respectively. Median age of clearance of maternal antibodies was 13.4 +/- 2.1 months. Serum immunoglobulin G was significantly elevated after 6 months in all 4 infected infants. Advanced maternal age (> or = 30 years; Fisher's exact test, P > 0.014) was associated with transmission. A trend in higher maternal viral burden was observed among transmitters. Non-syncytium-inducing phenotype was present initially in all transmitting mothers."

CD011926,0,23143714,0,Antineuronal antibodies and infectious pathogens in severe acute pediatric encephalitis.,"The pathogenesis of acute encephalitis is divided into either direct infection or by immune-mediated inflammation, but the cause is still unknown. This retrospective study aimed to screen antineuronal antibodies in children with severe acute encephalitis. Thirty-four children (22 boys and 12 girls) underwent assessments such as antineuronal antibodies survey for autoimmune encephalitis and polymerase chain reaction/viral culture and antibody assays for all commonly recognized causes of infectious encephalitis. Sixteen (47.1%) were positive for autoantibodies, including antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies in 16 and voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies in 1. Sixteen patients (47.1%) had presumed infectious etiologies, including 6 with influenza, 6 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 3 with enterovirus, and 1 with herpes simplex virus. In this study, influenza and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are the main presumed causes of severe acute encephalitis in children, although an immune-mediated mechanism may also play a role."

In order to evaluate their dissemination in Quebec, a surveillance program was introduced in 2010. We report the molecular and epidemiological profiles of CPE isolates collected. Between August 2010 and December 2012, a total of 742 non-duplicate isolates non-susceptible to carbapenems were analysed. AmpC β-lactamase and metallo-β-lactamase production were detected by Etest and carbapenemase production by the modified Hodge test (MHT). Antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined using broth microdilution or Etest. Clonality of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) strains was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The presence of genes encoding carbapenemases as well as other β-lactamases was detected using PCR. Of the 742 isolates tested, 169 (22.8%) were CPE. Of these 169 isolates, 151 (89.3%) harboured a blaKPC gene while the remaining isolates carried blaSME (n = 9), blaOXA-48 (n = 5), blaNDM (n = 3), and blaNMC (n = 1) genes. Among the 93 KPC strains presenting with a unique pattern (unique PFGE pattern and/or unique antibiotics susceptibility profile), 99% were resistant to ertapenem, 95% to imipenem, 87% to meropenem, 97% to aztreonam, 31% to colistin and 2% to tigecycline. In 19 patients, 2 to 5 KPC strains from different species or with a different PFGE pattern were isolated. CPE strains were present in the province of Quebec with the majority of strains harbouring KPC. Alternately, SME, OXA-48 and NMC containing strains were rarely found."
CD011926,0,1703387,0,Evolution of post-natal herpes simplex virus encephalitis to multicystic encephalopathy.,"A 3-week-old, previously healthy infant developed biopsy-proven Herpes virus type 2 (HSV-2) encephalitis. The encephalitis was characterized by cells having intranuclear inclusions and was without evidence of inflammation or hemorrhage. Neuroimaging studies did not show any destructive lesions in the brain. In spite of antiviral therapy, the infant's neurological conditions deteriorated, and the patient died at the age of 18 weeks. Post-mortem examination showed that most of the cerebral hemispheres were replaced by multiloculated cystic cavities of various sizes, typical of multicystic encephalopathy (MCE). The cystic lesions were randomly distributed and were not confined to any vascular territory. By light microscopy, there were no features of viral infection in the brain. Although in situ hybridization of the biopsy specimen taken during the acute phase of the disease demonstrated abundant HSV genome, this same method failed to detect HSV on the post-mortem specimen. These findings suggest that HSV-2 can induce MCE. Furthermore, the absence of histological features of viral encephalitis and the failure to demonstrate viral genome in the brain at autopsy does not exclude an infectious etiology in certain cases of MCE."

CD011926,0,15380273,1,Evaluation of a real-time fluorescent PCR assay for rapid detection of Group B Streptococci in neonatal blood.,"Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus: GBS) is the major causative agent of neonatal sepsis. Neonates at risk for GBS infections are empirically administered broad-spectrum antibiotics for at least 48 h pending blood culture results. A rapid assay to expedite detection of GBS would facilitate initiation of specific antibiotic therapy. Conversely, expeditious proof of absence of infection will avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. Using the LightCycler, we evaluated a hybridization probe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect GBS-specific cfb gene target DNA sequence in blood specimens. Both sensitivity and specificity of the real-time PCR assay was 100%. The assay demonstrated 100% specificity when tested against 26 non-GBS bacteria. This method is capable of detecting as few as approximately 100 copies or 10 pg of GBS genomic DNA. This real-time PCR method is rapid, sensitive, and specific for the detection of GBS in neonatal blood samples and holds great promise in its utility in the diagnostic laboratory."

CD011926,0,2546429,0,Mechanism for human papillomavirus transmission at birth.,"We attempted to investigate mechanisms, in addition to sexual contact, by which human papillomaviruses associated with anogenital tract lesions could be transmitted. Samples of exfoliated cervical cells were obtained from 45 pregnant women and were assayed by Southern blot hybridization analysis for the presence of human papillomavirus nucleic acids. Twenty-five of the 45 women had cells positive for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. A neonatal nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained at term and analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. We documented the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the oral pharyngeal cavity of the neonates in 15 of 45 nasopharyngeal samples analyzed. Amniotic fluid was obtained from 13 patients when their membranes were artificially ruptured. These samples were assayed for the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid; two of the 13 amniotic fluid samples contained human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. The detection of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the oral cavity of neonates is indicative of a perinatal mechanism of viral transmission. The detection of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the amniotic fluid may suggest an in utero mechanism of transmission. However, problems encountered in collecting the amniotic fluid samples preclude us from definitive interpretation of these data."
CD011926,0,12571529,0,Quantitative RNA testing for diagnosis of HIV-infected infants.,"Quantitative HIV RNA testing was used for diagnosis in 156 HIV-exposed non-breast-fed infants at less than 6 months of age (54 infected, 102 uninfected) enrolled in the Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study. Sensitivity was 29% in the first week, 79% at 8 to 28 days of age, and >90% at 29 days of age and thereafter; specificity was 100% in all periods, except at 29 to 60 days of age, when specificity was 93%. Neither sensitivity nor specificity was significantly affected by maternal or infant zidovudine (ZDV) treatment, even though infant viral loads were lower during the first 6 weeks in infants who received perinatal ZDV prophylaxis ( p=.005). Paired analysis of DNA and RNA measurements revealed no advantage for either test. Quantitative RNA testing can be used for diagnosis in HIV-exposed infants, recognizing the chance for a false-positive test result. It may be most useful as a confirmatory test in infants with another positive diagnostic test result."

All strains were analyzed by PCR to identify the resistance genes, and their susceptibilities to beta-lactam agents were determined. Of these strains, 29.1% were beta-lactamase nonproducing and ampicillin (AMP) susceptible (BLNAS) and lacked all resistance genes; 15.4% were beta-lactamase producing and AMP resistant and had the bla(TEM-1) gene; 30.6% were beta-lactamase nonproducing and AMP resistant (low-BLNAR) and had a Lys-526 or His-517 amino acid substitution in ftsI encoding PBP 3; 13.9% were beta-lactamase nonproducing and AMP resistant (BLNAR) and had an additional substitution of Thr-385 in ftsI; 9.1% were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistant (BLPACR I) and had the bla(TEM-1) gene and a Lys-526 or His-517 amino acid substitution in ftsI; and 1.8% showed resistance similar to that of the BLPACR I group (BLPACR II) but had bla(TEM-1) gene and ftsI substitutions, as was the case for the BLNAR strains. All but three strains were serotype b. The prevalence of BLNAR strains has increased rapidly: 0% in 1999, 5.8% in 2000, 14.1% in 2001, and 21.3% in 2002. The MICs at which 90% of BLNAR isolates were inhibited were as follows: AMP, 16 micro g/ml; cefotaxime, 1 micro g/ml; ceftriaxone, 0.25 micro g/ml; and meropenem, 0.5 micro g/ml. All of these values were higher than those for the BLNAS counterpart strains. The relatively wide distributions of the beta-lactam MICs for BLNAR strains presumably reflect variations in ftsI gene mutations. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis suggested the rapid spread of specific H. influenzae type b strains throughout Japan. Expedited vaccination, rapid identification, and judicious antibiotic use could slow their spread."
CD011926,0,21213034,0,Dynamics and constraints of early infant diagnosis of HIV infection in Rural Kenya.,"A cohort design was used to determine uptake and drop out of 213 HIV-exposed infants eligible for Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) of HIV. To explore service providers and care givers knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of the EID process, observations and in-depth interviews were conducted. 145 (68%) infants enrolled after 2 months of age. 139 (65%) dropped out before follow up to 18 months old. 60 (43%) drop outs occurred within 2 months of enrolment. Maternal factors associated with infant drop out were maternal loss to follow up (48 [68%] vs. 8 [20%], P < 0.001) and younger maternal age (27.2 vs. 30.1 years, P = 0.033). Service providers and caregivers had inadequate training, knowledge and understanding of EID. Poverty and lack of social support were challenges in accessing EID services. EID should be more closely aligned within PMTCT services, integrated with routine mother and child health (MCH) activities and its implementation more closely monitored."
CD011926,0,9841822,0,Distinct risk factors for intrauterine and intrapartum human immunodeficiency virus transmission and consequences for disease progression in infected children. Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study.,"Predictors and prognosis of intrauterine and intrapartum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission were investigated among 432 children of HIV-infected women in the Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study. Timing of transmission was inferred from polymerase chain reaction or viral culture within 2 days of birth. Proportions of infections due to intrauterine transmission were similar among women using (29%) or not using zidovudine (30%). Preterm delivery was strongly associated with intrapartum transmission (relative risk, 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-6.1), particularly among infants delivered longer after membrane rupture, but was not associated with intrauterine transmission. Progression to AIDS or death increased 2.5-fold (95% CI, 1.1-5.8) among intrauterine infected children, adjusting for preterm delivery, and maternal CD4 cell count. Early transmission appears unlikely to explain instances of zidovudine failure. Preterm infants may be more vulnerable to HIV acquisition at delivery, especially if membrane rupture is prolonged. Intrauterine infection does not appear to increase risk of preterm delivery."

HIV-1 env sequences were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in both chorionic villi and enriched trophoblastic cells of all 12 placentas but at variable rates of detection. Heteroduplex mobility assay analysis showed the presence of multiple HIV-1 env quasispecies in sequential maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples, but only a small number of env variants were found in chorionic villi and enriched trophoblastic cells. These data indicate that HIV-1 env sequences are always present in term placentas of seropositive women, contrasting with the low frequency at which infection is diagnosed by PCR in neonates with tat, gag, and env primers. Maternal HIV-1 variants appear to undergo a strong negative selection by different cell populations within the placental villi."

CD011926,0,15727905,0,Molecular heterogeneity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variants in the south of Thailand and identification of a novel variant (G6PD Songklanagarind).,"Two hundred and twenty-five G6PD-deficient subjects in Songklanagarind Hospital in the south of Thailand comprising 210 males and 15 females were studied. Neonatal jaundice was detected in 85% of these patients. Acute hemolysis related to infection was detected in 17.3% of the G6PD-deficient subjects. Drug-induced acute hemolysis was detected in 1.8% and favism was observed in 3.6% of G6PD-deficient patients. The molecular analysis was performed on 134 G6PD-deficient individuals by a combination of PCR-RFLP, multiplex polymerase chain reaction by multiple tandem forward primers and a common reverse primer assay (MPTP) and DNA sequencing to characterize the mutations of the samples with abnormal MPTP bands. We found 10 different missense G6PD mutations and the three most common variants were G6PD Viangchan 871,G-->A (31.3%), G6PD Kaiping 1388,G-->A (20.1%) and G6PD Mahidol 487,G-->A (17.2%) followed by G6PD Canton 1376,G-->T (9.7%), G6PD Union 1360,C-->T (2.2%), G6PD Gaohe 95,A-->G (1.5%), G6PD Quing Yuan 392,G-->T (0.7%), G6PD Mediterranean 563,C-->T (0.7%), G6PD Songklanagarind 196,T-->A (0.7%), silent mutation 1311,C-->T (6.7%), and uncharacterized variant (9%). A novel missense mutation at codon 196, TTC-->ATC in exon 4 of the G6PD gene predicting a single amino acid substitution, Phe66Ile was identified and we designated this novel class II variant as G6PD Songklanagarind. The G6PD variants among the Thais in the southern part are heterogeneous and G6PD Viangchan, Kaiping, Mahidol, and Canton variants account for about 78% of the cases. Our findings provide some evidence that G6PD Viangchan and Mahidol are common Southeast Asian variants and support the theory of genetic drifts throughout Southeast Asia."

These were monitored weekly for diarrhoea for 2 years. A total of 180 samples from cases of diarrhoea and 766 samples obtained during diarrhoea-free periods were studied by dot-blot hybridization with an EAV-specific DNA probe. EAV were found in 6/180 (3.3%) cases of diarrhoea and 6/766 (0.8%) asymptomatic samples (P < 0.015). Incidence of EAV was 3.9 cases per 100 person-years in children < 60 months old. EAV-related diarrhoeas were slight and of short duration. In addition, 129 faeces from hospital out-patients, 1-30 months old, were also studied. EAV was identified in 7/129 cases (5.4%). These cases were 9.5 +/- 3.5 months old and the diarrhoea was mild or severe, of 3 +/- 1.5 days of duration.

CD011926,0,19541789,0,Detection of Aspergillus DNA by a nested PCR assay is able to improve the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in paediatric patients.,"Fungal infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in severely immunocompromised patients and have been increasing in incidence in recent years. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common filamentous fungal infection and is, in adults as well as in children, difficult to diagnose. Several PCR assays to detect Aspergillus DNA have been established, but so far, studies on molecular tools for the diagnosis of IA in children are few. We evaluated the results of a nested PCR assay to detect Aspergillus DNA in clinical samples from paediatric and adolescent patients with suspected IA. Blood and non-blood samples from immunocompromised paediatric and adolescent patients with suspected invasive fungal infection were sent for processing Aspergillus PCR to our laboratory. PCR results from consecutive patients from three university children's hospitals investigated between November 2000 and January 2007 were evaluated. Fungal infections were classified according to the EORTC classification on the grounds of clinical findings, microbiology and radio-imaging results. Two hundred and ninety-one samples from 71 patients were investigated for the presence of Aspergillus DNA by our previously described nested PCR assay. Two, 3 and 34 patients had proven, probable and possible IA, respectively. Sensitivity (calculated from proven and probable patients, n=5) and specificity (calculated from patients without IA, n=32) rates of the PCR assay were 80 and 81 %, respectively. Our nested PCR assay was able to detect Aspergillus DNA in blood, cerebrospinal fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage samples from paediatric and adolescent patients with IA with high sensitivity and specificity rates."

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), HIV culture, and p24 antigen detection assays were evaluated for their ability to detect the presence of HIV in 195 infants at risk of perinatal infection. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for assessing HIV infection status in children younger than 18 months, 70 infants (36%) were diagnosed as HIV-1 infected and 125 (64%) lacked virologic and clinical evidence of infection. PCR and HIV culture were the most sensitive laboratory markers, detecting 100% and 98% of positive samples, respectively, regardless of age at testing. HIV-1 p24 antigen assay was detected in 26 of 38 positive samples but not in negative samples. PCR was performed with three different sets of primers (SK38/SK39-SK19-gag, SK68/SK69-SK70-env, and SK150/SK431-SK102-gag). The sensitivity/specificity of the individual assays were for SK19, 96.1%/94.25%; SK70, 89.6%/100%; and SK102, 100%/100%. A sample was considered HIV-1 positive when two positive PCR results were obtained with two different pairs of primers, and negative if the sample was negative when three sets of primers were used. False-positive results were occasionally obtained with probe SK19 in six seroreverter infants before serologic status was known. This suggested that the infection was caused by nonreplicative strains or were false-positive results probably by nonspecific amplification due to cross-reaction with other microorganisms; contamination was discarded because there was no specific amplification with the other two primers. All the HIV-1-infected infants were correctly identified with PCR; all except one could be identified with coculture and only 68.4% were confirmed with p24 antigen assay. No seroreverter infant was misdiagnosed using the criteria selected."
CD011926,0,16586267,0,[Human Metapneumovirus in hospitalized children - a review].,"The human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been discovered by von den Hoogen et al. in 2001 and seems to play an important role as etiologic agent in childhood respiratory tract infections in particular involving infants after the 6th month of life and toddlers. Duly considering the hitherto published studies and retrospective analysis of two HMPV seasons (2002-2004) at our institution this review focuses on children, who had to be hospitalized due to HMPV infection. The analysis confirmed, that among those patients there is a high proportion of children with pre-existing risk factors for a complicated clinical course, a high proportion of children with bronchiolitis or pneumonia and a relevant proportion of children with HMPV related apnoeas, most prevalent in the prematurely born. Although the first HMPV infection takes place somewhat later in infancy, the data do not show that HMPV infection is in general milder than RSV infection in hospitalized children. Clinical symptoms and radiological signs do not permit tentative conclusions on the causative agent. This underlines the necessity of specific diagnostic efforts (in case of HMPV with PCR). HMPV may cause lobar or segmental pneumonias difficult to distinguish from bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. Children admitted to the hospital with an acute exacerbation of asthma bronchiale or cystic fibrosis should not only be tested for RSV but also for HMPV. Prospective studies investigating specific therapeutic interventions or describing the impact and prevention of nosocomial HMPV in fection are awaited for. There has been one report of a meningoencephalitis possibly related to HMPV. Thus, liquor samples in such cases should be tested for HMPV too."

CD011926,0,8723785,0,Hematopoietic transplant potential of unrelated cord blood: critical issues.,"To date, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from human umbilical cord blood (CB) have been employed in approximately 90 allogeneic (56 sibling and 34 unrelated) matched and mismatched transplantations worldwide with easy and successful restoration of hematopoiesis. Requests for stem cell preparations from CB will continue to increase. Thus, as a pilot study, the examination and standardization of unrelated cord blood-derived stem cell preparations and banking as well as their biologic characterization were initiated. Up to October 1995, a total of 574 samples [mean volume 79 +/- 26 ml, total nucleated cells (NC) 8.5 +/- 5 x 10(8), BFU-E 9.5 +/- 8.6 x 10(5), CFU-GM 5.7 +/- 6.3 x 10(5), CFU-GEMM 1.6 +/- 1.9 x 10(5)] from cord-derived or placental-derived residual blood have been defined by hematologic, immunologic, and microbiologic criteria. These CB samples were collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after vaginal full-term delivery (n = 450) or cesarean section (n = 124) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. Seven percent of all samples collected could not be considered for potential transplants because of volumes < 40 ml. Only 5.0 ml of a CB sample is required for routine laboratory testing, consisting of HLA class I typing, HLA class II typing by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP), ABO typing, sterility control, assessment of progenitor and stem cells by colony-forming and LTC-IC assays, and CD34+ status. To assess the potential problem of contaminating maternal cells, a PCR was performed on 7 representative samples. During the initial 6 months of the unrelated CB collection program, a median bacterial contamination rate of 18% (20% skin flora species, 80% perineal flora species) was encountered, which has since been reduced to < 1% through practical experience. With regard to viral infections, maternal sera was tested for HBsAg (0.6% positive), anti-HCV (0%), anti-HAV (IgG 18%, IgM 0%), anti-HIV-1-2 (0%), anti-EBV (IgG 98%, IgM 0%), anti-HTLVI-II (0%), anti-CMV (IgG 43%, IgM 0.4%), toxoplasmosis (46%) and syphilis (0%). In addition, all cord blood samples were tested by PCR for CMV infection. With regard to its clinical relevance, it is important that only 0.3% of all the samples were positive for CMV by this sensitive method. This may represent a critical advantage of CB grafts over bone marrow (BM) since, in contrast, > 40% of the unrelated BM donors have been identified to be positive for CMV. An additional advantage of CB is that since 20% of CB samples were collected from ethnic minorities, it appears possible to balance common HLA types and uncommon HLA types represented in this group. In summary, with the extensive practical experience of the obstetric collection team as well as the stem cell-processing laboratory, it appears feasible to obtain a 90% yield of unrelated CB-derived stem cell preparations for banking, which clearly should meet the medical and regulatory qualification criteria required for clinical transplantation. To test the feasibility of hematopoietic transplant potential of unrelated CB for adult patients, ex vivo expansion of CD34+-enriched stem/progenitor cell populations isolated from fresh or frozen CB was attempted in the presence of rh-IL-3, rh-IL-6, rh-EPO, rh-GM-CSF, and rh-SCF with or without fit 3. At varying time points (days 0, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21), the contents of these cultures were analyzed for the numbers of cells, CFC (BFU-E, CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM), and LTC-IC. In this setting, the increase of cells was 200-fold, that of CFC 70-fold, and most importantly that of LTC-IC was 4.5-fold after 7 days in culture in the presence of flt3. In conclusion, LTC-IC derived from CB can be maintained and considerably expanded ex vivo from highly enriched CD34 + CB cell populations from fresh or frozen CB samples."

CD011926,0,7909225,0,Correlation between HIV provirus burden and in utero transmission.,"No predictive parameters of in utero or perinatal vertical transmission of HIV to newborns are known at present. Vertical transmission may be related to several biological parameters of maternal HIV infection: (1) immunological parameters (neutralizing antibodies); (2) the concentration of viral particles and/or infected cells; and (3) the selection of HIV subspecies of particular cellular tropism. The present study was designed to examine the relationship between cellular viral burden and transmission, and between maternal viral burden and CD4+ cell count and clinical status at delivery."
CD011926,0,9350736,0,Quantification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA from dried plasma spots collected on filter paper.,"To assess dried plasma spots (DPSs) as a source of material for virus quantification, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels were quantified in matched DPS and liquid plasma samples from 73 infected patients, including 5 neonates and 4 adult patients with acute HIV-1 infection. Quantifications were performed by commercially available assays (NASBA [nucleic acid sequence-based amplification] or Amplicor, or both). There was a strong correlation between HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma and DPSs. More importantly, there was no decline in HIV-1 RNA levels in DPSs stored for as long as 2 weeks at 20 degrees C. Similarly, storage of DPSs for 3 days at 37 degrees C resulted in no decrease in viral RNA levels. For patients with primary infection, the DPS method allowed for the measurement of RNA levels in plasma during the initial spike in the level of viremia and in the subsequent period of suppressed viral replication. DPS quantification was equally informative in the neonatal setting, with all five newborns showing HIV-1 RNA loads of greater than 4.991 log10 copies/ml. We conclude that the viral RNA levels in DPSs are equivalent to those measured in fresh-frozen plasma. The ease and economy of DPS sampling, the minute volumes required, and the unexpected stability of dried RNA suggest that the use of DPSs will be particularly valuable for small-volume neonatal samples and large, population-based studies in which cold storage and transportation present special problems, as is often the case in developing countries. The ability to measure viral changes during primary infection suggests that the method will be useful for assessing vaccine efficacy in large field trials."

CD011926,0,21520652,0,[Value of rapid tests for diagnosis of malaria in Benin].,"Reliable diagnosis of malaria is essential in malaria endemic areas. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of rapid diagnostic tests to that of the thick and thin blood smear techniques conventionally used for diagnosis of malaria. A total of 84 patients presenting malaria symptoms were included and tested for malaria. Results of blood smears and rapid tests performed blindly in external labs were compared with results of blood smears and PCR done in our reference laboratory. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were determined using PCR as the gold standard. Results of the rapid diagnostic test were much better than those of the microscopic technique performed in external labs, particularly with regard to true positivity. The blood smear technique in external labs led to 12 false positive diagnoses and was associated with a lower positive predictive value than the rapid test: 58.6% vs. 85.7%. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test were also higher than those obtained in external laboratories using blood smear techniques: 90.0% and 95.3% respectively versus 85.0% and 81.2% respectively. The results of this study indicate that the rapid test is more reliable than microscopy and that its use would improve malaria diagnosis. Risks factors for false diagnosis and limitations of the different diagnostic techniques are discussed."
CD011926,0,8326459,0,Demonstration of Coxsackie virus RNA in formalin-fixed tissue sections from childhood myocarditis cases by in situ hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction.,"This is a combined study using in situ hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction to investigate the presence of Coxsackie virus RNA in formalin-fixed tissue from cases of childhood myocarditis. Of the ten cases studied, two were positive by both methods. The virus RNA was predominantly located in areas showing an inflammatory cell infiltrate and myofibre necrosis. These findings suggest that direct lytic infection of myocytes by virus is responsible for myocarditis in these cases, rather than an autoimmune process, which has been suggested previously. The findings in one case, where the virus showed a marked sub-endocardial distribution, may have implications for the aetiology of endocardial fibroelastosis by confirming a viral tropism for this location. The techniques used in this study are easily repeatable and can be directly applied to look for viruses in a number of other diseases where a viral aetiology is suspected."
CD011926,0,7475309,0,Selection of a highly enriched population of retrovirus-infected human hematopoietic progenitor cells using SNL fibroblasts.,"Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into human hematopoietic progenitor cells for therapeutic or experimental purposes has proved difficult due to low and variable infection efficiency. To address this, we have developed an in vitro system for the selection and maintenance of a highly-enriched population of retrovirus-infected hematopoietic progenitor cells. Human umbilical cord CD34+ cells were cultured on SNL, a neo-containing murine fibroblast cell line used for embryonic stem cell culture. SNL-supported CD34+ cultures could be maintained with continuing blast cell and CFU-GM production for eight weeks, compared to four weeks in the absence of SNL. We then tested the ability of SNL to facilitate the selection in G418 of CD34+ cord cells infected with the neo-containing retrovirus, vsn-2. While all cells in the control cultures died within 14 days, vsn-2-infected CD34+ cells continued to proliferate, differentiate and produce CFU-GM for up to five weeks after infection. 100% of individually-plucked CFU-GM from such cultures were shown by PCR to be successfully infected. This approach should be useful for experimental work and, since it would diminish competitive repopulation between infected and uninfected progenitors, may also be utilized, with modification, for optimizing gene therapy protocols."
CD011926,0,15314204,0,"Prevalence of methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci in neonatal intensive care units: findings from a tertiary care hospital in India.","This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial resistance pattern and species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolated from the blood and skin of neonates with clinical suspicion of late-onset septicaemia (>72 h post-delivery) admitted to neonatal intensive care units, with particular reference to the phenotypic and genotypic expression of methicillin resistance. Blood culture specimens were collected by venipuncture from 660 such neonates in brain heart infusion broth. Skin swabs from axillae were obtained from 60 neonates and inoculated on mannitol salt agar. All CNS thus obtained were further identified and antibiotic sensitivity was performed according to NCCLS recommendations. PCR for the mecA gene was carried out on 54 randomly selected isolates. Staphylococcus haemolyticus was the commonest species (34 %) followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (24 %) amongst blood isolates. All blood isolates were sensitive to glycopeptides. Resistance to penicillin and methicillin was 94 and 66 %, respectively. Similar biotypes and antimicrobial resistance patterns were observed in skin isolates. All phenotypically methicillin-resistant isolates had the mecA gene and two of the phenotypically methicillin-sensitive isolates were also positive for mecA. A PCR assay for detection of the mecA gene in CNS may be a beneficial adjunct to standard susceptibility testing for timely and reliable detection of methicillin resistance. Given the large number of methicillin-resistant CNS, inclusion of vancomycin in empiric therapy for neonates with late-onset septicaemia may be justified."
CD011926,0,22330957,0,Clinically based surveillance of invasive meningococcal disease in young children admitted to selected US hospitals between January 2000 and June 2009: a retrospective cohort study.,"Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is under-reported in countries that do not employ polymerase-chain reaction for surveillance because culture-negative cases are omitted. To evaluate a clinically based, case-finding method, we developed case definitions for ""probable,"" ""compatible with,"" and ""possible, but unlikely"" IMD, respectively, based on supportive documentation (e.g., discharge diagnosis of meningococcal infection, culture-negative bacterial meningitis, petechiae/purpura, Gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain) and weight of clinical evidence, which we then applied to electronic health records for all children aged ≤5 y who were admitted to approximately 100 US hospitals between January 2000 and June 2009. Among 47,863 qualifying admissions, 16 children had culture-positive IMD, 5 had ""probable"" IMD, and 5 had illness ""compatible with"" IMD. Five additional children had disease considered ""possible but unlikely"" IMD. Our case-finding methods suggest that culture-based ascertainment may underestimate the number of IMD cases by 31-63%, supporting findings in other nations that culture-based reporting provides incomplete information on disease incidence and therefore underestimates the potential benefits of routine vaccination of young children against meningococcal disease."
CD011926,0,17299708,0,Preconceptual administration of an alphavirus replicon UL83 (pp65 homolog) vaccine induces humoral and cellular immunity and improves pregnancy outcome in the guinea pig model of congenital cytomegalovirus infection.,"Development of a vaccine against congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major public health priority. We report the use of a propagation-defective, single-cycle, RNA replicon vector system, derived from an attenuated strain of the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, to produce virus-like replicon particles (VRPs) expressing GP83, the guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) homolog of the human CMV pp65 phosphoprotein. Vaccination with VRP-GP83 induced antibodies and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses in GPCMV-seronegative female guinea pigs. Guinea pigs immunized with VRP-GP83 vaccine or with a VRP vaccine expressing influenza hemagglutinin (VRP-HA) were bred for pregnancy and subsequent GPCMV challenge during the early third trimester. Dams vaccinated with VRP-GP83 had improved pregnancy outcomes, compared with dams vaccinated with the VRP-HA control. For VRP-GP83-vaccinated dams, there were 28 live pups and 4 dead pups (13% mortality) among 10 evaluable litters, compared with 9 live pups and 12 dead pups (57% mortality) among 8 evaluable litters in the VRP-HA-vaccinated group (P<.001, Fisher's exact test). Improved pregnancy outcome was accompanied by reductions in maternal blood viral load, measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. These results indicate that cell-mediated immune responses directed against a CMV matrix protein can protect against congenital CMV infection and disease."
CD011926,0,20827111,0,Systemic Tropheryma whipplei: clinical presentation of 142 patients with infections diagnosed or confirmed in a reference center.,"Culture of Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple disease (WD), was achieved in our laboratory in 2000, allowing new perspectives for the diagnosis of this disease and for the description of other potential clinical manifestations caused by this microorganism. Since 2000, we have developed new tools in our center in Marseille, France, to optimize the diagnosis of T whipplei infections. Classic WD was characterized by positive periodic acid-Schiff performed on duodenal biopsy. In the absence of duodenal histologic involvement, localized infections were defined by specific positive T whipplei polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results obtained using samples of other tissues and body fluids. The physicians in charge of patients were asked to complete a questionnaire. A total of 215 diagnoses were performed or confirmed and, among these, 142 patients with sufficient clinical data were included.Herein, we report epidemiologic data, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic tools of T whipplei infections. In the 113 patients with classic WD, the main symptom was arthralgia (88/113, 78%), which explains the many cases misdiagnosed as inflammatory rheumatoid disease (56/113, 50%). Frequently immunosuppressive treatments, more recently including tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, had been previously prescribed (50%) and were often responsible for more rapid clinical progression (43%). Sometimes a short course of antibiotics improved the clinical status.Endocarditis was the second most frequent manifestation of T whipplei, with 16 cases. The clinical picture of this entity corresponds to cardiovascular involvement with acute heart failure (50%) occurring without fever (75%) or previous valvular disease (69%). Neurologic symptoms were the third major manifestation. Other localized infections such as adenopathy, uveitis, pulmonary involvement, or joint involvement were sporadic. Infection with T whipplei resulted in multifaceted conditions. Some localized infections due to this agent have recently been reported and may correspond to emerging entities. Patients with inflammatory rheumatoid disease must be systematically interviewed to determine the efficacy of previous immunosuppressive and antibiotic therapies."

CD011926,0,24224641,0,Human papilloma virus is not prevalent in nevus sebaceus.,"Nevus sebaceus (NS) is a common congenital cutaneous hamartoma that typically presents on the scalp and face at birth or in early childhood. Occasionally NS can be associated with the Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome, which presents with concomitant severe neurologic, skeletal, cardiovascular, ophthalmic, and genitourologic disorders. In a previous study, maternal transmission of the human papillomavirus (HPV) and infection of ectodermal stem cells by HPV was postulated to result in the development of NS. In this study we aimed to determine the incidence of HPV infection in pediatric NS samples to further clarify the potential link between HPV and the pathogenesis of NS. NS tissue samples (N = 16) were analyzed for HPV DNA using type-specific, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 and conventional PCR with modified general primers designed for broad-range HPV detection. The tissues were also histologically evaluated for evidence of HPV infection. HPV DNA was not detected in any of the NS tissue samples using PCR and HPV-associated histopathologic changes were absent in all 16 NS tissues. HPV infection is an unlikely etiologic cause of NS."

We used a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect Shigella in the stool samples of 3,533 children aged <59 months from the Gambia, Mali, Kenya, and Bangladesh, with or without moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD). We compared the results from conventional culture to those from qPCR for the Shigella ipaH gene. Using MSD as the reference standard, we determined the optimal cutpoint to be 2.9 × 10(4) ipaH copies per 100 ng of stool DNA for set 1 (n = 877). One hundred fifty-eight (18%) specimens yielded >2.9 × 10(4) ipaH copies. Ninety (10%) specimens were positive by traditional culture for Shigella. Individuals with ≥ 2.9 × 10(4) ipaH copies have 5.6-times-higher odds of having diarrhea than those with <2.9 × 10(4) ipaH copies (95% confidence interval, 3.7 to 8.5; P < 0.0001). Nearly identical results were found using an independent set of samples. qPCR detected 155 additional MSD cases with high copy numbers of ipaH, a 90% increase from the 172 cases detected by culture in both samples. Among a subset (n = 2,874) comprising MSD cases and their age-, gender-, and location-matched controls, the fraction of MSD cases that were attributable to Shigella infection increased from 9.6% (n = 129) for culture to 17.6% (n = 262) for qPCR when employing our cutpoint. We suggest that qPCR with a cutpoint of approximately 1.4 × 10(4) ipaH copies be the new reference standard for the detection and diagnosis of shigellosis in children in low-income countries. The acceptance of this new standard would substantially increase the fraction of MSD cases that are attributable to Shigella."

The results were compared with those obtained by virus isolation in tissue culture and antigen detection with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA). RSV-RNA was detected by seminested RT-PCR in 57 of the 59 samples that were positive by virus isolation and/or ELISA, as well as in 25 of 73 samples negative by virus isolation and ELISA. Eighteen of these 25 samples were obtained from children older than one year of age, 17 of whom were experiencing reinfection, as indicated by the presence of preexisting serum RSV-IgG antibodies. These results indicate that seminested RT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional methods for the detection of RSV in patients experiencing reinfections and suggest that this assay might also be useful for rapid diagnosis of RSV infections in older people."

CD011926,0,16831054,0,The utility of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in placental pathology.,"It has long been recognized that routine histologic examination of the placenta has limitations, especially with regard to the diagnosis of infectious diseases and the concomitant cytokine response that may cause severe in utero fetal damage. Immunohistochemical testing of the placenta in such situations can be very useful in terms of identifying the infectious agent as well as in demonstrating a marked increase in cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 8, produced primarily by cells native to the villi and fetal membranes. One hundred placentas (20 normal childbirths, 20 with severe neonatal morbidity of known cause, 25 idiopathic stillbirths where autopsy material was available, 35 with severe idiopathic neonatal morbidity) were examined for a wide variety of infectious diseases and cytokine production. An infectious agent was evident in 19 (76%) of 25 placentas from stillbirths and 28 (80%) of 35 placentas associated with idiopathic severe neonatal morbidity. No infectious agent was noted in the placentas from normal childbirths or cases of known neonatal morbidity. The most common infectious agent was coxsackie virus (51% of infections) followed by bacterial infections (24% of infections). The same infectious agent found in the placenta was found in the corresponding autopsy material from the stillbirths, with the spleen containing the greatest number of infected cells. There was a strong correlation between the number of cells demonstrating cytokine expression (tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 8) and the presence of an infectious disease in the placenta and stillborn. No histologic feature was associated with an in utero infection. Immunohistochemical testing of placentas gives much insight into their structure and function, including, besides infectious disease detection, the marked diversity of function of trophoblasts, the rarity of committed B cell response, and the strong potential of contractility of villi."

The difficulty lies more in the interpretation of the confirmatory assay than in technical problems. The result is critical since the continuation or interruption of pregnancy is dependent upon it. The diagnosis of HIV infection in newborns has been hampered by the presence of passively acquired maternal antibodies. The diagnosis at birth therefore must include culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells for virus isolation and detection of serum antigen. However, due to the difficulty or lack of sensitivity of these tests new diagnostic procedures, such as the polymerase chain reaction, must be developed to improve the accuracy of the early diagnosis. Such new approaches must be evaluated very carefully before being introduced in routine diagnosis."

CD011926,0,16023520,0,Diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus infection by detection of viral DNA in urine pools.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most frequent cause of congenital infection. Diagnosis of this infection is important because 5-17% of asymptomatic infected babies will develop late sequelae and should be followed closely. Most of these children will remain undetected, since screening of all newborns by viral culture is too expensive. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that pool testing could be used to detect HCMV congenital infection in newborns. For this purpose, a nested-PCR technique was tested in urine pools. In phase 1, urine specimens were tested alone by nested-PCR and compared with viral culture, followed by cross experiments to test the reliability of detecting one positive specimen in a 20 samples in a urine pool. In phase 2, this pool method was applied to all urine specimens from children received in the virology laboratory of the Centro Hospitalar Cova da Beira for diagnosis of HCMV infection, between January 2002 and March 2003. In phase 1, 74 urine specimens were tested simultaneously by shell-vial culture and nested-PCR; 17 were positive and the remaining 57 negative by both methods. The negative specimens were divided into three pools and each pool was tested alone and crossed with each of the positive specimens by nested-PCR. Although the three pools were negative when tested alone, all 51 crossed results were positive. In phase 2, 15 out of the 180 urine samples tested positive by shell-vial culture and were detected by this pool method. These results suggest that urine pools can be used to detect HCMV positive urines in children, with similar sensitivity and specificity when compared with the standard method, but with a substantial labour reduction. This significant reduction in labour and consequently in cost per test, opens the possibility of applying PCR to urine pools for screening the HCMV congenital infection in newborns."
CD011926,0,3085381,0,[Bacteriophages and bacteriocins of the genus Listeria].,"Since the discovery of the first Listeria bacteriophage by Schultz in 1945, more than 219 phages were isolated for L. monocytogenes, L. invanovii, L. innocua, L. seeligeri and L. welshimeri. To date, no phage for L. murrayi and L. grayi is described in the literature. Unless two phages found by Jasińska in a water sample, all the other phages, when the origin is mentioned, were isolated from lysogenic strains, with or without induction. Electron microscopic examination of 55 Listeria phages revealed that two L. innocua phages belonged to the Myoviridae family (tail with contractile sheath) whereas the 53 other phages of L. monocytogenes, L. ivanovii and L. innocua belonged to the Siphoviridae family (tail without contractile sheath). According to the length of the tail, phages of this second group were divided into three species (species 2685, 2671 and 2389). DNA/DNA hybridizations, performed with the method of Southern, after digestion of the DNAs with Eco RI, pointed out three genomic groups: one corresponded to a single phage of Myoviridae and the two others included phages of the Siphoviridae species 2671 and 2685, thus demonstrating a good correlation between ultrastructure and DNA relatedness. Serology of Listeria phages remained unclear. Host range studies showed that these phages are genus specific and allowed to type 34% to 80% Listeria strains. Phage typing of Listeria strains isolated during listeriosis epidemics and cross infections in nursery proved to be useful in order to elucidate epidemiology of this disease. Listeria phages were used to detect Listeria strains in various samples by phage fluorescent antiphage staining system and phage titer increase test. Some phages seem to induce prophylaxis against listeriosis when tested in animal listeric pneumonia and conjunctivitis models. The possible role of phages in the virulence of L. monocytogenes needs further investigations. Bacteriocins of Listeria, called monocins, were first described by Sword and Pickett in 1961. Monocins isolated by Hamon and Péron were resistant to trypsin, inactivated at 50 degrees C and at pH 4,5 and sedimented at low speed, suggesting that these bacteriocins might be in fact defective phages. This was confirmed by Bradley and Dewar by electron microscopic study. Host range of monocins included Listeria, Staphylococcus and Bacillus."
CD011926,0,10511402,0,Phenotypic detection of nosocomial mecA-positive coagulase-negative staphylococci from neonates.,"Over a 3-year period, we screened antimicrobial resistance genotype (mecA-positive or -negative) in clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from patients residing in our neonatal intensive care unit. For the 152 study strains, the accuracy of standard methods (agar dilution MIC, disc diffusion and agar screen tests) in detecting oxacillin resistance during 48 h of incubation was evaluated. Using mecA gene PCR and Southern blot hybridization as the gold standard, the differential in MICs of additional antibiotics selected for their relevant clinical use in our setting was also compared with mecA status of the isolates. The frequency of mecA was 48.6% among study strains. When applying the previous (1998) and most current (1999) NCCLS interpretive criteria, the specificities of oxacillin agar dilution MICs in detecting the 78 mecA-negative isolates were 100 and 89.7%, respectively, at 24 h, and 100 and 80.7%, respectively, at 48 h. In this respect, the sensitivities of oxacillin agar dilution MICs in detecting the 74 mecA-positive strains were 75.6 and 97.2%, respectively, at 24 h, and 86.4 and 100%, respectively, at 48 h. When applying the previous and most current NCCLS zone size interpretive criteria, oxacillin zone diameters were in false-susceptible error for 13.5 and 8.1%, respectively, of the 74 mecA-positive strains tested at 24 h, and for 6.7 and 2.7%, respectively, at 48 h. Accordingly, when the 78 mecA-negative strains were considered, oxacillin zone diameters were in false-resistant error for 2.5 and 8.9%, respectively, at 24 h, and for 8.9 and 15.3%, respectively, at 48 h. The oxacillin salt agar screen assay accurately identified all mecA-negative strains at both 24 and 48 h. However, 26 (35.1%) and 7 (9.4%) of the mecA-positive strains were misinterpreted as susceptible by the agar screen test at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Using the presence of mecA as the reference standard for interpreting oxacillin susceptibility results, strains lacking mecA were more likely to be susceptible to ampicillin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, netilmicin and rifampicin than were mecA-positive strains. Vancomycin was the only antibiotic tested for which all strains, regardless of mecA status, remained susceptible."
CD011926,0,19031443,0,Identification of viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections in Hong Kong by multiplex PCR assays.,"Acute respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of hospital admission of children. This study used a broad capture, rapid and sensitive method (multiplex PCR assay) to detect 20 different respiratory pathogens including influenza A subtypes H1, H3, and H5; influenza B; parainfluenza types 1, 2, 3, and 4; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) groups A and B; adenoviruses; human rhinoviruses; enteroviruses; human metapneumoviruses; human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and SARS-CoV; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; Legionella pneumophila; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae; from respiratory specimens of 475 children hospitalized over a 12-month period for acute respiratory tract infections. The overall positive rate (47%) was about twice higher than previous reports based on conventional methods. Influenza A, parainfluenza and RSV accounted for 51%, and non-cultivable viruses accounted for 30% of positive cases. Influenza A peaked at March and June. Influenza B was detected in January, February, and April. Parainfluenza was prevalent throughout the year except from April to June. Most RSV infections were found between February and September. Adenovirus had multiple peaks, whereas rhinovirus and coronavirus OC43 were detected mainly in winter and early spring. RSV infection was associated with bronchiolitis, and parainfluenza was associated with croup; otherwise the clinical manifestations were largely nonspecific. In general, children infected with influenza A, adenovirus and mixed viruses had higher temperatures. In view of the increasing concern about unexpected outbreaks of severe viral infections, a rapid multiplex PCR assay is a valuable tool to enhance the management of hospitalized patients, and for the surveillance for viral infections circulating in the community."
CD011926,0,11317077,0,HIV seroconversion during pregnancy and risk for mother-to-infant transmission.,"Pregnant women infected with HIV-1 were enrolled in a prospective mother-to-infant transmission study from 1992 through 1994 in Bangkok. In participating hospitals, voluntary HIV testing was routinely offered at the beginning of antenatal care and again in the middle of the third trimester of pregnancy. Women who seroconverted to HIV during pregnancy were compared with women who had tested positive on their first antenatal test. Maternal HIV RNA levels were determined during pregnancy, at delivery, and postpartum using RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and infection status in infants was determined by DNA PCR. No infants were breast-fed, but prophylactic antiretroviral therapy was not yet used in Thailand to prevent transmission from mother to infant. Among enrolled women, 16 who seroconverted during pregnancy and 279 who were HIV-1-seropositive at their first antenatal test gave birth. Median plasma RNA levels at delivery were similar for the two groups (17,505 and 20,845 copies/ml, respectively; p =.8). Two (13.3%) of 15 infants born to women who seroconverted and 66 (24.8%) of 266 infants born to previously HIV-seropositive women were infected with HIV (p =.5). There was no increased risk for mother-to-infant HIV transmission and no significant difference in viral load at delivery between HIV-infected women who seroconverted to HIV during pregnancy and those who were HIV-seropositive when first tested."

Diagnostic methods have until recently been available only for a limited number of these viruses. With the objective to achieve sensitive assays for all respiratory viruses, a rational workflow in the laboratory, and a short turn-around time, a real-time PCR diagnostic platform for daily rapid detection of 15 respiratory viruses was developed. The system was evaluated on 585 stored nasopharyngeal aspirates from hospitalized children. Previous analysis by immunofluorescence and virus isolation identified viruses in 37% of the samples while the new PCR diagnostic panel detected 57% virus positive samples. The new platform was introduced in the laboratory in October 2007 and has then fully replaced the standard immunofluorescence assay for rapid detection of viruses and virus isolation."

The potential for developing complications is higher in certain risk groups, such as children, the elderly and individuals with chronic medical conditions. We have presented a duplex real-time RT-PCR for detection of influenza A and B. The sensibility of our method was estimated at 0.01TCID(50)/ml for detection of influenza A and 0.1TCID(50)/ml for influenza B. Any other viruses with respiratory tract tropism were detected with our method. After that, we tested our duplex RT-PCR on 119 samples (nasal aspirates and liquids of broncho-alveolar washes) collected in the CHRU of Lille between November 2005 and January 2006 from patients aged one month to 81 years. Conventional methods such as direct immunofluorescence (IF) assay and/or cell culture were applied on these samples. Four samples were positive for influenza A virus detection and, in particular, one liquid of broncho-alveolar wash for which the direct IF assay was negative. Thus, our method is adapted to diagnosis of flu infections. Nevertheless, our duplex RT-PCR will be tested during a flu outbreak."

CD011926,0,24396988,0,Clonal spread of vancomycin resistance Enterococcus faecalis in an Iranian referral pediatrics center.,"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) represent as an immediate threat to public health. Since few active compounds are available for VRE infections, rapid identification of these isolates are essential. In the absence of any report on the genetic relatedness of Enterococcus faecalis especially Vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VREF) isolates in Iran, we undertook this study to characterize these isolates using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR) genotyping method. In this study, E. faecalis strains isolated from various samples collected from different wards of Children Medical Hospital (Tehran, Iran). These isolates were identified by standard laboratory procedures and tested for antimicrobial resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. The genetic similarity of the strains was investigated by amplification of the RAPD-PCR. In our study among 91 E. faecalis isolates, 15 (16%) were identified as VREF. The similarity pattern built for E. faecalis isolates by RAPD-PCR, demonstrated the presence of four distinct clusters (A, B, C, D). It is of interest to note that 100% of VREF isolates belonged to Clusters A, indicating that there may have occurred horizontal transmission of the same strain between patients. In conclusion, rapid spread of VREF from a clonal origin calls for implementation of careful isolation and infection control measures. Therefore, environmental control by routine disinfection of patient area as well as screening of high risk patients and isolation of colonized patients should be imposed in order to diminish risk of acquiring nosocomial VRE."
CD011926,0,18352906,0,Studies on diarrheagenic Escherichia coli isolated from children with diarrhea in Myanmar.,"Escherichia coli isolates from 217 children in Myanmar with diarrhea were investigated for the presence of virulence genes related to diarrhea by colony hybridization and PCR. The genes examined were lt, stI, stII, stx1, stx2, eae, bfp, pCVD (which is the representative gene of plasmid of pCVD of EAEC), and ial (which is invasion-associated locus of the invasion plasmid found in EIEC). Isolates from 47 of 217 children (21.7%) possessed virulence genes characteristic of diarrheagenic E. coli. No instance was found of co-existence of different E. coli strains with different virulence genes in the same patient. Diarrheagenic E. coli are currently classified into five categories based on their virulence markers: ETEC, EHEC, EPEC, EAEC, and EIEC. Of the 47 isolates examined, 30 were EAEC, 12 were EPEC and 5 were ETEC. Susceptibility tests for antimicrobial agents showed that almost all diarrheagenic isolates were resistant to penicillin, tetracycline and streptomycin. However, the majority of strains were sensitive to cephalexin, nalidixic acid and norfloxacin. In particular, 42 of the 47 isolates were sensitive to norfloxacin, which is a fluoroquinolone. This study shows EAEC and EPEC are responsible for sporadic diarrhea in Myanmar and fluoroquinolones appear to be effective in the treatment of these patients."
CD011926,0,22205822,0,"Characterization of isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Stanley, a serovar endemic to Asia and associated with travel.","Salmonella enterica serovar Stanley (S. Stanley) is a common serovar in Southeast Asia and was the second most common serovar implicated in human salmonellosis in Thailand in the years 2002 to 2007. In contrast, this serovar is relatively uncommon in Europe. The objective of this study was to characterize a collection of S. Stanley strains isolated from Thai (n = 62), Danish (n = 39), and French (n = 24) patients to gain a broader understanding of the genetic diversity, population dynamics, and susceptibility to antimicrobials. All isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The molecular mechanisms of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and plasmid-mediated resistance to quinolones were characterized by PCR and sequencing. Plasmid profiling, replicon typing, and microarray analysis were used to characterize the genetic mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in 10 extended-spectrum cephalosporinase-producing isolates. Considerable genetic diversity was observed among the isolates characterized with 91 unique XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, including 17 distinct clusters consisting of two to seven indistinguishable isolates. We found some of the S. Stanley isolates isolated from patients in Europe were acquired during travel to Southeast Asia, including Thailand. The presence of multiple plasmid lineages carrying the extended-spectrum cephalosporinase-encoding bla(CMY-2) gene in S. Stanley isolates from the central part of Thailand was confirmed. Our results emphasize that Thai authorities, as well as authorities in other countries lacking prudent use of antimicrobials, should improve the ongoing efforts to regulate antimicrobial use in agriculture and in clinical settings to limit the spread of multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates and plasmids among humans and pigs in Thailand and abroad."

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nasopharyngeal aspirates revealed HCoV infection in 79 cases (3.8%): 33 HCoV-229E (1.6%), 13 HCoV-NL63 (0.6%), 11 HCoV-OC43 (0.5%), none HCoV-HKU1 genotype A, and 22 (1.1%) co-detections of a HCoV and another respiratory virus. The HCoVs were identified mainly in children with upper respiratory tract infection; there was no significant difference in clinical presentation between single HCoV infections and HCoV co-infections. Diagnostic methods were used in a limited number of patients, and the therapy prescribed and clinical outcomes were similar regardless of the viral strain. There were a few cases of other members of the households of HCoV-positive children falling ill during the 5-7 days following enrollment. These findings suggest that HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have a limited clinical and socioeconomic impact on otherwise healthy children and their household contacts, and the HCoV-NL63 identified recently does not seem to be any different. The quantitative and qualitative role of HCoV-HKU1 genotype A is apparently very marginal."
CD011926,0,17063526,0,Prospective identification of HEV-B enteroviruses during the 2005 outbreak.,"Enteroviruses (EVs) represent the main etiological agents of epidemics of viral meningitis and especially the serotypes related to the human enterovirus B species. Genetic typing by sequencing a PCR-amplified portion of the genome has proved to be useful for identifying EVs and is more rapid than standard seroneutralization tests. However, prospective genotyping has not been reported in routine practice within a clinical diagnostic laboratory. A genetic typing assay using two sets of primers was developed for the amplification and sequencing of the VP1 coding sequence of the HEV-B serotypes. Identification was carried out by sequence comparisons with EV sequences in GenBank using the BLAST search tool and confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. This method was used to identify prospectively the 48 enteroviruses isolated in patients with either enterovirus-proved meningitis (n = 41) or other clinical manifestations (n = 7) admitted to the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand (France) in 2005. The assay was also used to type retrospectively EVs isolated in cerebrospinal fluid specimens of 25 patients admitted to the Trousseau Paediatric Hospital in Paris (France) between February and August 2005. In both prospective and retrospective investigations of meningitis, echovirus 30 (E30) was the most frequent serotype, followed in decreasing order by E18, E13, coxsackievirus B5, B3, E6, E4, E7, E11, E33, and coxsackievirus A9. In patients with other manifestations, coxsackievirus B3, B5, and E3 were each identified twice, and E2 once. In E30 infected patients, nine different lineages were demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis. Genetic typing allowed the prospective, effective and rapid identification of all EV isolates involved in the 2005 outbreak. Molecular typing in combination with phylogenetic analysis will be a reliable means to confirm the emergence of new EV variants, and is of interest of both individual patients and public health."

CD011926,0,22184940,0,[UL55 genotype diversity of cytomegalovirus strains isolated from newborns and infants hospitalized in southern Poland].,"Studies on cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections more often draw attention to the differences in tropism, pathogenicity and virulence of the virus depending on its genotype. The aim of this study was to assess the individual gB genotypes which are encoded in UL55 region of HCMV genome in a population of newborns and infants from Southern Poland. Genotypic analysis was carried out on 53 children (16 newborns and 37 neonates) with confirmed HCMV infection. The children were tested several times. A total of 101 samples, mainly urine, less blood, swabs from the upper respiratory tract, in justified cases, the cerebrospinal fluid were used in our study. Both genotyping and quantitative assessment of HCMV were performed using real time-PCR (rt-PCR). For identification of four major gB genotypes in one reaction, a modification of multiplex rt-PCR was used. Studies confirmed the presence of all major genotypes: gB1, gB2, gB3 and gB4 in the examined groups of children. Only in one case, the genotype could not be determined, perhaps it belonged to subtypes outside the detectable majority ofgB genotypes. Genotype gB1 (63.5%) which was slightly more frequent in infants than in neonates, dominated in our studies. The other genotypes occurred at a rate: gB2 - 15.4%, gB3 - 21.2%, gB4 - 28.8%, respectively. Mixed infections, caused by two genotypes were found in 16 (31%) children, mainly in older infants. There were no statistically significant differences in viral load when comparing a group of newborns with infants and single vs. mixed infection, as well as individual genotypes. The observed differences in the proportional occurrence of different gB genotypes in the two study groups of children may suggest various preferences of particular HCMV genotypes in congenital and acquired infections. Moreover, by monitoring of HCMV infection and determination the genotypes in consecutive samples, it could be identified infection acquired during hospitalization in three children."

CD011926,0,8283801,0,[The diagnosis of HIV infection by detecting specific nucleotide sequence].,"There are several methods to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; the detection of antibodies against HIV, the detection of HIV particles, and the detection of HIV infected cells. The detection of anti-HIV antibodies is practical, but the antibodies are undetectable both on a seronegative person at the superacute phase, and the new-born baby from a seropositive mother. No other method is ideal for all purposes. Thus the detection of the HIV-specific nucleotide sequence especially using the PCR method has been expected. We developed a quantitational PCR method to assay HIV-infected PBMC cell number, and the result correlated with that of the quantitational culture method, and also correlated with the CD4 count, that is inversely related to the clinical stage of HIV infection. Our quantitational PCR method must be improved before application to a practical routine test. A new PCR kit to detect HIV infected cells qualitatively has been developed and purchased in Europe. This kit is especially workable to test specimens where the antibody detection method cannot be used. PCR can be used on other specimens and can be applied to HIV infection. HIV RNA (both genomic RNA and viral mRNA) can be detected by a combination with the reverse transcriptase reaction. This method (RT-PCR) will be ideal to detect HIV particles. With PCR, the sequence-differentiation between each clinical virus strain may be detected, thus the characterization of a virus strain such as drug resistance, latency, or the prognosis may be recognized. PCR is indeed a valuable method to detect HIV-infection, provided its limits are properly understood."

The new env primers detected HIV-1 proviral DNA in 100% (11/11) and 88% (37/42) of the subtype B and E infection cases, respectively. The env primers also detected proviral DNA in saliva and breast milk samples in seven of 11 cases and two of three cases, respectively. The PCR subtyping results matched completely with those obtained by nucleotide sequencing of the env V3 region. The results suggest that the PCR using the env primers designed in this study may be an accurate and cost-effective method for differentiating subtypes B and E of HIV-1 in a large number of clinical samples. However, subtype E specific primer cross-react with subtype A, C, G, the new primer in this study is useful for regions in South East Asia where subtype E is predominant."
CD011926,0,25740764,0,Assessing the public health risk of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli by use of a rapid diagnostic screening algorithm.,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is an enteropathogen of public health concern because of its ability to cause serious illness and outbreaks. In this prospective study, a diagnostic screening algorithm to categorize STEC infections into risk groups was evaluated. The algorithm consists of prescreening stool specimens with real-time PCR (qPCR) for the presence of stx genes. The qPCR-positive stool samples were cultured in enrichment broth and again screened for stx genes and additional virulence factors (escV, aggR, aat, bfpA) and O serogroups (O26, O103, O104, O111, O121, O145, O157). Also, PCR-guided culture was performed with sorbitol MacConkey agar (SMAC) and CHROMagar STEC medium. The presence of virulence factors and O serogroups was used for presumptive pathotype (PT) categorization in four PT groups. The potential risk for severe disease was categorized from high risk for PT group I to low risk for PT group III, whereas PT group IV consists of unconfirmed stx qPCR-positive samples. In total, 5,022 stool samples of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were included. The qPCR detected stx genes in 1.8% of samples. Extensive screening for virulence factors and O serogroups was performed on 73 samples. After enrichment, the presence of stx genes was confirmed in 65 samples (89%). By culture on selective media, STEC was isolated in 36% (26/73 samples). Threshold cycle (CT) values for stx genes were significantly lower after enrichment compared to direct qPCR (P < 0.001). In total, 11 (15%), 19 (26%), 35 (48%), and 8 (11%) samples were categorized into PT groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Several virulence factors (stx2, stx2a, stx2f, toxB, eae, efa1, cif, espA, tccP, espP, nleA and/or nleB, tir cluster) were associated with PT groups I and II, while others (stx1, eaaA, mch cluster, ireA) were associated with PT group III. Furthermore, the number of virulence factors differed between PT groups (analysis of variance, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, a diagnostic algorithm enables fast discrimination of STEC infections associated with a high to moderate risk for severe disease (PT groups I and II) from less-virulent STEC (PT group III)."
CD011926,0,10856776,0,Rapid detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical samples by real-time PCR.,"M. pneumoniae is a common causative agent of community-acquired pneumonia in children. The diagnosis of such infections is usually based on serology using complement fixation or, more recently, enzyme-immuno assays. PCR has been shown to be a promising alternative. We have evaluated a real-time PCR assay targeting the P1 adhesion protein gene and compared it to a conventional semi-nested PCR assay with the 16S rDNA as target. Comparison of 147 specimens from 48 patients showed an overall agreement of 97.4%. Real-time PCR proved to be of equal value on clinical specimens as conventional PCR regarding sensitivity and specificity, but is clearly advantageous regarding speed, handling and number of samples that can be analyzed per run."

Infection in these vulnerable infants has been linked to the consumption of contaminated powdered infant formula (PIF). Considerable research has been undertaken on this organism in the past number of years which has enhanced our understanding of this neonatal pathogen leading to improvements in its control within the PIF production environment. The taxonomy of the organism resulted in the recognition of a new genus, Cronobacter, which consists of seven species. This paper presents an up-to-date review of our current knowledge of Cronobacter species. Taxonomy, genome sequencing, current detection protocols and epidemiology are all discussed. In addition, consideration is given to the control of this organism in the manufacturing environment, as a first step towards reducing the occurrence of this pathogen in PIF."

CD011926,0,23065545,0,Distribution of pilus islands of group B streptococcus associated with maternal colonization and invasive disease in South Africa.,"Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis. Sortase-dependent pilus-like structures have been identified on the surface of GBS, and have been found to be important in the adhesion and attachment of GBS to host cells. Three pilus island alleles, PI-1, PI-2a and PI-2b, have been described, and their proteins are being explored as vaccine candidates. The pilus islands from 541 colonization isolates and 284 invasive isolates were characterized by PCR. All isolates carried at least one pilus island, and they were identified alone or in combinations at the following overall frequencies: PI-2a, 29.8 %; PI-2b, 0.2 %; PI-1+PI-2a, 24.8 %; and PI-1+PI-2b, 45.1 %. A combination of PI-1+PI-2a (28.7 vs 17.6 %) was more common among colonizing compared with invasive isolates. Conversely, a combination of PI-1+PI-2b (37.2 vs 60.2 %) was more frequently associated with invasive disease compared to colonization. There was a strong association between pilus islands when adjusted for serotype distribution, PI-2a was identified in 92.6 % of colonizing and 90.0 % of invasive serotype Ia isolates, whereas serotype III was associated with co-expression of a PI-1 and PI-2b among 84.6 % of colonizing and 96.5 % of invasive isolates. Based on this homogeneity of pilus island distribution, a pilus-based vaccine developed for Europe and the USA will have similar coverage in South Africa."
CD011926,0,11146249,0,The potential utility of the Semi-Nested Multiplex PCR technique for the diagnosis and investigation of congenital malaria.,"We report three cases of congenital malaria involving two malarial immune mothers living in Spain. Diagnostic PCR and Genotyping PCR for merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 were essential to show that mothers and new-borns had different Plasmodium population parasites at the moment of the delivery, and that the infection was acquired earlier in gestation by transplacental transmission. In the first case the Plasmodium species founded in both, mother and child were different. Malaria in the twins showed a mixed infection (P. falciparum plus P. malariae) while the mother presented a P. falciparum infection. These facts were confirmed studying the polymorphisms for MSP1 and MSP2. Blood samples of the newborns were analyzed an half hour after delivery excluding the possibility of re-infection by mosquito bite and indicating a vertical transmission during pregnancy."

A diagnosis of early congenital syphilis was made based on a treponemal serologic test. Pathologic examination of the skin lesion showed scattered dyskeratotic cells in the epidermis and interface dermatitis consistent with erythema multiforme. No spirochete could be found in the skin sections staining with Warthin-Starry stain. Using nested polymerase chain reaction, treponemal genomic DNA fragments encoding DNA polymerase I were detected."
CD011926,0,18207613,0,Recombinant porcine lactoferrin expressed in the milk of transgenic mice protects neonatal mice from a lethal challenge with enterovirus type 71.,"The human Enterovirus genus of the piconavirus family causes most of the febrile illnesses that affect children during the summer season in Taiwan. Enterovirus type 71 (EV71) plays a key role in patients with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) combined with severe paralysis or encephalitis. It is important to find a method for preventing infection with EV71 since there is no antiviral agent or vaccine for humans. In this study, we developed a transgenic mouse model for demonstrating the protective effects of recombinant lactoferrin (LF) against EV71 infection. Transgenic mice carrying alpha-lactalbumin-porcine lactoferrin (alphaLA-pLF) and BALB/c wild-type mice were subjected to EV71 inoculation. First, we analyzed the expression efficiencies of recombinant pLF (rpLF) in hemizygous and homozygous transgenic mice. Following EV71 inoculation on the 4th day of life, pups ingesting transgenic milk showed the significantly higher survival rate and heavier body weight compared to wild-type mice. RT-PCR analysis for EV71 viral RNA showed that the recombinant pLF had a blocking effect on EV71 infection. Our data suggest that oral intake of pLF-enriched milk exhibited the ability to prevent infection with EV71. The study also provides an animal model for validating the protective effects of pLF."
CD011926,0,24277047,0,More complications occur in macrolide-resistant than in macrolide-sensitive Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia.,"We sought to understand the situation of macrolide-resistant genotypes of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and analyze the relationship between macrolide-resistant genotypes and clinical manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP). Full-length sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene of M. pneumoniae was performed in 235 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from children with MPP. We also retrospectively compared the clinical characteristics of macrolide-resistant (MR) M. pneumoniae infections and macrolide-sensitive (MS) M. pneumoniae infections. A total of 206 patients had point mutations in the M. pneumoniae 23S rRNA gene, and these patients are referred to as MR patients. The remaining 29 patients without point mutations are referred to as MS patients. Among 206 MR patients, 199 (96.6%) had A2063G mutations, 6 had A2063T mutations, and the remaining patients had an A2064G mutation. Among the clinical manifestations, we found that the median fever durations were 8 days (range, 0 to 42 days) and 6 days (0 to 14 days) (P < 0.01), the median hospitalization durations were 8 days (2 to 45 days) and 6 days (3 to 16 days) (P < 0.01), and the median fever durations after macrolide therapy were 5 days (0 to 42 days) and 3 days (0 to 10 days) (P < 0.01), respectively, in the MR and MS groups. We also found that the incidence of extrapulmonary complications in the MR group was significantly higher than that in the MS group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the radiological findings were more serious in the MR group than in the MS group (P < 0.05). The increasing prevalence of MR M. pneumoniae has become a significant clinical issue in the pediatric patients, which may lead to more extrapulmonary complications and severe clinical features and radiological manifestations."

CD011926,0,7546908,0,"Identification of human T cell lymphotropic virus type IIa infection in the Kayapo, an indigenous population of Brazil.","Human T cell lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) infection is endemic in a number of indigenous populations in North, Central, and South America. In the present study we have employed serological and molecular methods to identify HTLV-II infection in Indian communities in the Amazon region of Brazil. Sera (1324) from 25 different Indian communities were analyzed by ELISA and Western blot. One hundred and four samples (7.8%) from a number of culturally distinct and geographically unrelated populations were found to have reactivities consistent with HTLV-II infection. Of these, 67 were from the Kayapo Indian communities, which had an overall seroprevalence rate of greater than 30%. In addition, high seroprevalence rates were observed in three other communities, the Munduruku, Arara do Laranjal and the Tyrio, suggesting that there are additional foci of endemic infection in the Amazon region. In the Kayapo, seroprevalence rates tended to increase with age, supporting the importance of sexual transmission of the virus, and family studies demonstrated that vertical transmission is also an important route of infection. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and nucleotide sequence analysis of a region of the env gene demonstrated that the Kayapo are infected with the HTLV-IIa subtype. Moreover, nucleotide sequence analysis of the LTR demonstrated that this belonged to a distinct HTLV-IIa phylogenetic group. The identification of HTLV-IIa in the Kayapo is, as far as we are aware, the first identified endemic focus of infection by this subtype of HTLV-II in the Americas."

CD011926,0,8195364,0,"Arbitrarily primed PCR, ribotyping, and plasmid pattern analysis applied to investigation of a nosocomial outbreak due to Enterobacter cloacae in a neonatal intensive care unit.","In December 1992, Enterobacter cloacae was isolated from the oropharynx and respiratory tract of six ventilated neonates hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital. To establish the spread of the outbreak, 41 strains of E. cloacae were analyzed for genotypic markers by three methods: plasmid profile analysis, ribotyping with EcoRI or PvuII endonuclease, and arbitrarily primed (AP) PCR. The tested strains included 12 isolates from the 6 epidemic cases, 4 isolates from the respiratory tract of 4 children hospitalized in other wards during the same period, 13 isolates from 12 children hospitalized in pediatric units before or after the outbreak, and 12 epidemiologically unrelated isolates. Ribotyping and AP PCR demonstrated that each of the last 12 strains exhibited distinct genomic patterns, as did each of the strains isolated from neonates hospitalized before or after the epidemic peak. Conversely, two clones of strains were found among the isolates recovered in December, with concordant results being obtained by the three typing methods: the first clone included seven strains from five ventilated children in the ICU and two children from another ward; another clone was shared by one neonate in the ICU and an infant from another ward. These results indicate that ribotyping and AP PCR-the latter applied, to our knowledge, for the first time to the genotypic analysis of E. cloacae--represent very discriminatory tools for the investigation of nosocomial outbreaks caused by this species."
CD011926,0,19828744,0,Enhanced viral etiological diagnosis of respiratory system infection outbreaks by use of a multitarget nucleic acid amplification assay.,"A study was undertaken to assess the utility of the xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) for enhanced laboratory investigation of respiratory outbreaks. Specimens (n = 1,108) from 244 suspected respiratory virus outbreaks in 2006 and 2007 in Alberta, Canada, were included in the study. Testing by direct fluorescent antigen detection (DFA) and various in-house nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) for common respiratory viruses provided an etiological diagnosis in 177 outbreaks (72.5%), with 524 samples testing positive (47.3%) for a respiratory virus. Two hundred samples from 51 unresolved outbreaks were further tested by RVP retrospectively. Fifty-eight samples from 30 unresolved outbreaks had a respiratory virus detected by RVP (47 picornavirus-positive, 9 coronavirus-positive, and 2 influenza virus A-positive samples). Overall, detection of a viral etiological agent was achieved in 90.8% of outbreaks using a combination of DFA, NATs, and RVP. Use of RVP enhances the laboratory investigation of respiratory virus outbreaks and facilitates appropriate patient and outbreak management."

A total of 488 fecal specimens from diarrheic and non-diarrheic children were obtained between January and December 2012. RVA detection was initially performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, followed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers. RVA was detected in 18.3% (44/241) of the children with acute diarrhea and in 1.2% (3/247) of the non-diarrheic children (P < 0.001), with overall RVA-positivity of 9.6% (47/488). The most common genotype was G2P[4] with 43.2% (19/44) of the diarrheic cases, followed by G12P[8] (27.3%, 12/44), G3P[6] (18.2%, 8/44), G3P[8] (4.5%, 2/44), and G12P[6] (2.3%, 1/44). G12 samples belonged to lineage III and were from children aged 4-52 months. All of these children had acute diarrhea associated with fever (83.3%, 10/12) and vomiting (66.7%, 8/12). Most of the cases occurred in August (58.3%, 7/12), 75% (9/12) of which having received the full vaccination scheme with Rotarix™. For the first time G12 was reported at relative high prevalence in Brazil. Our findings warrant further monitoring studies on the molecular characterization of circulating RVA strains after rotavirus vaccine introduction in Brazil and elsewhere, since the occurrence of either unusual our emerging genotypes may pose a challenge to vaccination strategies."

CD011926,0,18816191,0,Progressive telomere shortening of Epstein-Barr virus-specific memory T cells during HIV infection: contributor to exhaustion?,"Individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have low numbers of functional Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific CD8+ T cells in the face of a high EBV load, suggesting that these cells have become exhausted. We investigated whether the observed chronic EBV loads during HIV infection could cause exhaustion of EBV-specific T cells by using flow-FISH (flow cytometry in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization) to analyze the telomere length of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. Enhanced telomere shortening of EBV-specific T cells was observed during HIV infection, compared with the decline in telomere length observed in the CD8+ T cells of healthy subjects. Thus, chronic exposure to high antigen levels may lead to the progressive shortening of telomeres of antigen-specific T cells, which may impair viral control."

CD011926,0,8391544,0,Analysis of gamma delta+ T cells in peripheral blood of children with perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.,"The present study examined CD8 antigen expression and variable (V) gene segment usage by T cell receptor (TCR)-gamma delta+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood of symptomatic children with perinatal HIV infection. The relative number of gamma delta+, CD8+ T cells in most of the infected children was higher than that in uninfected children from HIV+ or HIV- mothers and correlated with the immunodeficiency status of the patients. Infected infants and children over 1 year old also showed an increased proportion of V delta 1-J delta 1+ T lymphocytes. CD8 expression on those cells was higher in infected than in uninfected infants and children. Sequence analysis of the delta gene rearrangement of the predominant V delta 1 family in peripheral blood of three HIV+ donors revealed extensive junctional diversity. These results suggest that the V delta skewing in the majority of HIV+ children reflects peripheral expansion of V delta 1-J delta 1+ T lymphocytes early in life, which might be involved in the mechanisms of HIV-induced immunodeficiency."
CD011926,0,25381148,0,Molecular characterization of carbapenemase and cephalosporinase genes among clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii in a tertiary medical centre in Malaysia.,"Antimicrobial resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii is a growing public health concern and an important pathogen in nosocomial infections. We investigated the genes involved in resistance to carbapenems and cephalosporins in clinical A. baumannii isolates from a tertiary medical centre in Malaysia. A. baumannii was isolated from 167 clinical specimens and identified by sequencing of the 16S rRNA and rpoB genes. The MIC for imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime and cefepime were determined by the E-test method. The presence of carbapenemase and cephalosporinase genes was investigated by PCR. The isolates were predominantly nonsusceptible to carbapenems and cephalosporins (>70 %) with high MIC values. ISAba1 was detected in all carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii harbouring the blaOXA-23-like gene. The presence of blaOXA-51-like and ISAba1 upstream of blaOXA-51 was not associated with nonsusceptibility to carbapenems. A. baumannii isolates harbouring ISAba1-blaADC (85.8 %) were significantly associated with nonsusceptibility to cephalosporins (P<0.0001). However, ISAba1-blaADC was not detected in a minority (<10 %) of the isolates which were nonsusceptible to cephalosporins. The acquired OXA-23 enzymes were responsible for nonsusceptibility to carbapenems in our clinical A. baumannii isolates and warrant continuous surveillance to prevent further dissemination of this antibiotic resistance gene. The presence of ISAba1 upstream of the blaADC was a determinant for cephalosporin resistance. However, the absence of this ISAba1-blaADC in some of the isolates may suggest other resistance mechanisms and need further investigation."
CD011926,0,24277440,0,Genotyping of human parechoviruses in Iranian young children with aseptic meningitis and sepsis-like illness.,"Human parechoviruses (HPeV) are classified into 14 genotypes. HPeV1 and HPeV2 are the most prevalent genotypes in young children, which have been associated with mild to severe diseases. This study was conducted to investigate the involvement of HPeVs in aseptic meningitis and sepsis-like illness in Iran. Viral RNA was extracted from 148 cerebrospinal fluid samples from children <8 years old with primary diagnosis of aseptic meningitis and/or sepsis-like illness. Specific HPeV, HEV real-time PCR and HPeV typing were done to identify the infection rate of these viruses. HPeV and HEV were detected in 64 (43.24 %), 31 (20.94 %) of 148 patients with 10 (6.75 %) coinfection. VP1/VP3 junction region was successfully sequenced from 12 of the HPeV-positive specimens, and all of them were identified as HPeV1. HPeV was more prevalent than HEV in both aseptic meningitis and sepsis-like illness, so further studies are needed to understand the disease burden of HPeV infections, and clinical manifestations especially in specific illnesses of possible viral etiology. Direct detection of these viruses leads to reduce hospitalization and use of antibiotic, which are often followed by other complications in neonates and young children."

CD011926,0,18428135,0,Genotypes of varicella-zoster virus wild-type strains in Germany.,"Surveillance of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) genotypes is indicated in Germany after implementation of universal varicella vaccination. This article reports genotyping data of 77 VZV strains obtained from 54 patients with varicella, 1 newborn with congenital varicella syndrome, 2 fetuses with intrauterine VZV infection and 20 cases with zoster. Fragments of the open reading frames (ORF) 1, 21, 22, 37, 50, 54, and 60 were analyzed by sequencing. In addition, the PstI polymorphism of the ORF 38 was characterized. Thirty strains, 22 from varicella and 8 from zoster, had the genetic markers of genotype E2, 2 of them carried new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Twenty-nine VZV isolates, 17 from varicella, and 12 from zoster, could be analyzed as E1 strains, 6 of them as E1 variants containing individual SNPs. Finally, 17 strains taken from primary VZV infection were classified as genotype M1, 13 of which belonged to the M1 subtype 1, 3 to the M1 subtype 2, and 1 to the M1 subtype 3. One strain was regarded as potential E2/J recombinant. In conclusion, VZV genotypes E2, E1, and M1 can be found in nearly equal incidence in varicella in Germany. The most frequent group is attributed to the genotype E2. Genotype M1 strains can only be detected after primary VZV infection and not in zoster cases. The possible recombinant could not be classified definitely by the scattered SNP method used and, therefore, has to be confirmed by full-genome sequencing studies."

The major causative agent is Trichosporon asahii; its route of infection is not clear. To elucidate whether this microorganism is part of the cutaneous microbiota, we examined skin samples from 380 healthy Japanese ranging in age from 0 to 82 years using a nested PCR assay. The colonization frequency of T. asahii increased with age up to 13-15 years in male and 30-39 years in female subjects, subsequently decreasing gradually in both sexes until senescence. Of the nine genotypes of the intergenic spacer region of the T. asahii rRNA gene, type 1 predominated (81.7%), followed by types 4 (6.7%) and 6 (5.5%). The distribution of identified genotypes was similar to that for T. asahii isolated from clinical specimens (blood and urine) of patients with deep-seated trichosporonosis and quite different from that of environmental isolates. Additionally, T. asahii DNA was detected stably from skin samples over 1 year. The opportunistic yeast pathogen T. asahii is part of the cutaneous fungal microbiota in humans. Cutaneous T. asahii may be one of the routes through which deep-seated trichosporonosis is acquired, whereas environmental T. asahii is not associated with this infection."

CD011926,0,14766841,0,Identification and H(2)O(2) production of vaginal lactobacilli from pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth and relation with outcome.,"Lactobacilli, principally the strains that are hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) producing, may have a protective effect against vaginal colonization by pathogenic species such as those that cause bacterial vaginosis. Previous reports have also suggested that H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli in the vagina may protect pregnant women against ascending infection of the chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cavity. We report the identification and H(2)O(2) production of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal swabs collected at 20 weeks' gestation from a population of pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. We also report the correlation between identification and H(2)O(2) production in relation to the outcomes of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. Lactobacilli were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. H(2)O(2) production by isolates was determined by a semiquantitative method. The most commonly isolated species were L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. vaginalis and L. jensenii. Amounts of H(2)O(2) produced by lactobacilli varied widely. The presence of lactobacilli producing high levels of H(2)O(2) in the vagina of this population of pregnant women was associated with a reduced risk of bacterial vaginosis at 20 weeks' gestation and subsequent chorioamnionitis. L. jensenii and L. vaginalis produced the highest levels of H(2)O(2). We postulate that H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli are able to reduce the incidence of ascending infections of the uterus and the subsequent production of proinflammatory molecules which are important in the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth."

CD011926,0,11526149,0,Outbreak of infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a Mexican hospital.,"Thirty-one strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (including 10 duplicates) from 21 septicemic pediatric patients (age, <2 months) were studied during a 4-month period (June to October 1996) in which the fatality rate was 62% (13 of 21). These isolates identified by the API 20E system yielded the same biotype. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis experiments revealed the same clone in 31 strains. The isolates were multidrug-resistant but were still susceptible to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and cefoxitin. A 135-kb plasmid was harbored in all of the isolates. No transconjugants were obtained that were resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime, tetracycline, or gentamicin. Isoelectric focusing for beta-lactamases was performed on all strains, and three bands with pIs of 5.4, 7.6, and 8.2 were obtained. Of these, the pI 8.2 beta-lactamase had an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype. PCR amplification of both TEM- and SHV-type genes was obtained. The sequence analysis of the SHV PCR product indicated a mutation corresponding to the SHV-5 beta-lactamase."

CD011926,0,17956825,0,[Epidemiology and bacteriological diagnosis of paediatric acute osteoarticular infections].,"Acute paediatric osteo-articular infections require a fast and sensitive diagnosis allowing a treatment directed to the causative pathogen. Many micro-organisms can be incriminated, but Staphylococcus aureus and Kingella kingae markedly prevail. K. kingae became the first bacterial species responsible for septic arthritis in children < 3 years. More rarely, (2)haemolytic Streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae are found. The incidence of community acquired S. aureus resistant to oxacillin in osteo-articular infections is still low in France. The microbiological diagnosis of septic arthritis relies upon analysis of articular fluid, which requires systematic inoculation of a blood culture vial to increase the recovery rate of K. kingae. If the culture is negative, it is recommended to carry out a universal PCR or a PCR targeted to the main germs responsible for septic arthritis. Indeed, PCR represents an undeniable benefice for the diagnosis of paediatric septic arthritis, particularly for the DNA detection of K. kingae. The diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis relies primarily upon blood cultures, since the bone puncture is not a systematic procedure in this setting. Their efficiency is low, and there is still a need to look for other arguments of diagnosis such as search of possible portals of entry or specific serologies."

One strain of TOSV was isolated from a total of almost 23 000 sandflies collected in Kabylia, Algeria. The complete genome was sequenced, and phylogenetic studies indicated that it was most closely related with TOSV strain from Tunisia within lineage A, which also includes Italian, French and Turkish strains. A seroprevalence study performed on 370 sera collected from people living in the same area showed that almost 50% possessed neutralizing antibodies against TOSV, a rate much higher than that observed in Southern Europe. Sandfly species distribution in the study area suggests that the vector of TOSV in this region belongs to the subgenus Larroussius.

CD011926,0,19478488,0,Congenital varicella syndrome: still a problem?,"A woman contracted chickenpox in the 12th week of gestation. Her general practitioner and later the consultant obstetrician warned her about the small risk of giving birth to a disabled child. She decided to continue the pregnancy without undergoing invasive tests to diagnose fetal intrauterine infection. Symptoms of congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) were detected by ultrasound in the 29th and 34th weeks of gestation. On admission to hospital, the baby was not considered infectious and was not isolated because polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect varicella zoster virus (VZV) DNA in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, skin scrapings and feces gave negative results. He was also not separated from his mother. The mother was without clinical complications. Varicella during pregnancy may result in VZV transmission to the fetus or newborn. Intrauterine VZV infection in the first 28 weeks of gestation may result in CVS with limb deformities, brain abnormalities and mental retardation. Usually the newborn is not infectious, and therapy and isolation are unnecessary. When the mother catches the infection in the second trimester, the newborn may manifest shingles in the first 2 years of life. A maternal rash erupting 5 days before to 2 days after delivery is frequently associated with clinically severe varicella in the newborn, leading to high mortality if untreated. Then the newborn is infectious and must be isolated. This case report underlines the need for expert medical counseling for women who contract chickenpox at any time during pregnancy. It also underlines the importance of immunizing susceptible women of childbearing age before they become pregnant."

The present study describes the epidemiology of invasive N. meningitidis isolates in Sweden in the period between 2010 and 2012, with a focus on serogroup Y. We also aimed to find an optimal molecular typing scheme for both surveillance and outbreak investigations. All invasive N. meningitidis isolates in Sweden during the study period (n=208) were genetically characterised. Serogroup Y predominated with 22/57, 31/61 and 44/90 of all invasive isolates (incidence 0.23, 0.33 and 0.46 per 100,000 population) in 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively.

CD011926,0,9033642,0,Epstein-Barr virus-associated Hodgkin's disease: epidemiologic characteristics in international data.,"Hodgkin's disease (HD) has long been suspected to have an infectious precursor, and indirect evidence has implicated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous herpesvirus, as a causal agent. Recent molecular studies using EBER in situ hybridization or latency membrane protein-I (LMP-I) immunohistochemistry have identified EBV latent infection in up to 50% of HD tumors. However, the epidemiologic features of these cases have not been examined in detail. To explore the epidemiology of EBV-positive HD so as to understand the role of EBV in HD etiology more clearly, this project accumulated patient data from 14 studies that had applied these EBV assays to HD tumors. With information on age at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, histologic subtype, country of residence, clinical stage and EBV tumor status from 1,546 HD patients, we examined risk for EBV-positive disease using logistic regression. Forty percent of subjects had EBV-positive tumors, and EBV prevalence varied significantly across groups defined by the study variables. Odds ratios (OR) for EBV-associated HD were significantly elevated for Hispanics vs. whites (OR = 4.1), mixed cellularity vs. nodular sclerosis histologic subtypes (OR = 7.3, 13.4, 4.9 for ages 0-14, 15-49, 50+ years), children from economically less-developed vs. more-developed regions and young adult males vs. females (OR = 2.5). These findings suggest that age, sex, ethnicity and the physiologic effects of poverty may represent biologic modifiers of the EBV association and confirm that this association is strongly but variably linked to histologic subtype. The data augment biologic evidence that EBV is actively involved in HD pathogenesis in some cases but describe epidemiologic complexity in this process."
CD011926,0,2848897,0,Detection of cytomegalovirus in urine from newborns by using polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification.,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used to detect cytomegalovirus (CMV) in tissue culture and in urine specimens from newborns. Synthetic oligonucleotide primer pairs were used to amplify DNA from the major immediate-early and the late antigen genes of CMV. Amplified products were detected by gel electrophoresis and by dot-blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. Using one or both of the primer pairs and associated probes, we found 46 different tissue culture isolates of CMV that were positive; no reaction products were detected when the same primers and probes were used to amplify other herpes family viruses or human genomic DNA. Urine samples from 44 congenitally infected infants were positive when tested with one or both primer pairs and probes. When compared with tissue culture, detection by gel electrophoresis provided a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 100%, and a predictive value of a positive result of 100%. Dot-blot analysis raised the sensitivity to 100%. We conclude that PCR amplification may be a valuable tool for diagnosing congenital CMV infection."
CD011926,0,18928062,0,Virulence characteristics of Escherichia coli isolates from children with urinary tract infections.,"The urinary tract is among the most common sites of bacterial infection and E. coli is by far the most common infecting agent in children and adults of both sexes. In an attempt to evaluate the intrinsic virulence of E. coli uroisolates from children, 54 strains were assessed by using PCR for the presence of five representative genetic determinants coding for adherence systems (pap, sfa/foc, afa), and toxins (hly and cnf). The prevalence of pap, sfa/foc and afa genes was 55%, 54%, and 44%, respectively. Hemolysin-encoding gene hly was detected in 55% strains, while cnf was exhibited by 35% of the screened E. coli isolates. Among the 39 PCR positive strains isolated from children's urine cultures the co-occurrence of the various targeted virulence genes was detected in 30 strains, the virulence profiles identified suggesting the presence of their localization on chromosomal regions known as pathogencity-associated islands. The rapid and reliable detection of the intrinsic virulence potential by this molecular approach could be very useful when evaluating the importance of microorganism pathogenicity versus host's susceptibility for developing an overt symptomatology of infection."
CD011926,0,25596125,0,Microbiological characteristics of acute osteoarticular infections in children.,"This study aimed to describe the microbiological characteristics of acute septic arthritis (SA) and osteomyelitis (OM) in children. Cases of children (0-15 years) with SA/OM were identified through a retrospective search of hospital discharge codes over a six-year period. In addition, a systematic literature search and meta-analysis of studies reporting culture results of children with SA/OM was performed. In our retrospective chart review, we identified 65 cases of OM and 46 cases of SA. The most frequently cultured organisms in both conditions were Gram-positive cocci, primarily Staphylococcus aureus. On admission, most patients had a normal white blood cell count (WCC) but elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Bacteraemia was associated with a longer mean length of hospitalization for both infections. Considering our results and the meta-analysis, we found low rates of culture-positivity in cases of clinically confirmed infection. In SA, articular fluid was culture-positive in 42.49% [95% confidence interval (CI) 28.39-57.23]. In OM, intra-operative samples were culture-positive in 52.65% (95% CI 30.54-74.22). Bacteraemia was detected in 23.91% (95% CI 8.40-44.24) of children with SA and 21.48% (95% CI 10.89-34.47) with OM. Despite appropriate sampling, a positive microbiological diagnosis is often lacking in paediatric acute osteoarticular infection using standard culture-based methods. This highlights the need for validation and use of more sensitive diagnostic methods, such as PCR."

A total of 190 blood specimens and 5 cerebrospinal fluid specimens from neonates with suspected sepsis or bacterial meningitis were evaluated with 16S rRNA gene-based real-time FQ-PCR assay. The positive rate of the real-time FQ-PCR assay was significantly higher (25/195, 12.82%) than that of bacterial culture (15/195, 7.69%; P = .002). When bacterial culture was used as a control, the sensitivity of the real-time FQ-PCR was 100%, the specificity was 94.4%, and Youden's index was 0.944. This study suggests that 16S rRNA gene-based real-time FQ-PCR assay is an important and accurate method in the detection of bacterial pathogens of sepsis and bacterial meningitis and should have a promising usage in the diagnosis of sepsis and bacterial meningitis."

Diagnosis was made by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs in 11,016 children who presented with > or = 7 days of cough at 63 pediatric practices in Germany. Of these children, 33 (4.5%) were hospitalized at a mean age of 4.8 months (range, 17 days to 19.5 months). Complications occurred in 16 (48%) of the 33 patients. Pneumonia developed in two (6%) children and a convulsion was observed in one (3%). Intensive care monitoring was required for 23 (70%) children. Further complications were bradycardia (21%), apnea (12%), conjunctivitis (12%), loss of weight (12%), otitis media (6%), atelectasis (3%) and dehydration (3%). Children aged 6-24 months who had not received any dose of pertussis vaccine had a ten-fold increased risk of hospitalization compared to those who had been partially or fully immunized (p < 0.05). Pertussis immunization should be given at an early point in time and completely in order to prevent severe courses of pertussis and hospitalization in young children."

These diagnosis methods were used for the first time in a Tunisian prospective study to estimate the prevalence of MP infection in children and to evaluate their usefulness for diagnosis. A total of 540 children hospitalized in Tunis for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) between 2005 and 2009 and 580 clinical specimens were investigated for the presence of MP by culture and by end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the P1 and the 16S rRNA genes. Real-time PCR was also used for MP detection on 158 respiratory samples. A total of 525 serum samples were tested for detection of MP-specific IgM and IgG. The P1 adhesin type and the antibiotic susceptibility testing were determined for the 9 clinical strains isolated during the study period. MP was detected in 33 (5.7%) clinical samples. Specific MP seropositivity was confirmed in 54 serum samples (10.3%), among which 19 (3.6%) were indicative of acute MP infection. MP infection was confirmed in 39 (7.2%) patients: 24 positive by PCR and/or culture, 10 serologically positive only, and 5 confirmed positive by both methods. MP infections occurred throughout the year with a slight decrease in autumn. The 9 MP isolates were susceptible to erythromycin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin, and all belonged to type I. The prevalence of MP infection in children with LRTI was 7.2% between 2005 and 2009, in Tunisia.

Four polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ""schemes"" were used to detect genes of the 6 pathotypes of DEC. In 394 children with diarrhea, 203 (52%) DEC infections were found. Among the 198 controls, 126 (63%) DEC infections were found. Enteroaggregative E. coli was the most common pathotype by multiplex PCR both in cases (58, 14.7%) and controls (47, 23.7%), followed by enteropathogenic E. coli seen in 10% cases and 8% of controls. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) were found in 4.1%, 2.0%, 1.0%, and 0.5% of cases, respectively. ETEC was found in 2.5% of controls, but EHEC, EIEC, and DAEC were not detected. Overall, no single assay worked well, but by discounting genes with a pathogenicity index of less than 1, it was possible to use the PCR assays to identify DEC in 75/394 (19%) cases and 12/198 (6.1%) controls, while mixed infection could be identified in 8/394 (2%) cases and 2/198 (1%) controls."

All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI."

CD011926,0,23735308,0,Using a bayesian latent class model to evaluate the utility of investigating persons with negative polymerase chain reaction results for pertussis.,"Pertussis remains difficult to control. Imperfect sensitivity of diagnostic tests and lack of specific guidance regarding interpretation of negative test results among patients with compatible symptoms may contribute to its spread. In this study, we examined whether additional pertussis cases could be identified if persons with negative pertussis test results were routinely investigated. We conducted interviews among 250 subjects aged ≤18 years with pertussis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results reported from 2 reference laboratories in Wisconsin during July-September 2010 to determine whether their illnesses met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's clinical case definition (CCD) for pertussis. PCR validity measures were calculated using the CCD as the standard for pertussis disease. Two Bayesian latent class models were used to adjust the validity measures for pertussis detectable by 1) culture alone and 2) culture and/or more sensitive measures such as serology. Among 190 PCR-negative subjects, 54 (28%) had illnesses meeting the CCD. In adjusted analyses, PCR sensitivity and the negative predictive value were 1) 94% and 99% and 2) 43% and 87% in the 2 types of models, respectively. The models suggested that public health follow-up of reported pertussis patients with PCR-negative results leads to the detection of more true pertussis cases than follow-up of PCR-positive persons alone. The results also suggest a need for a more specific pertussis CCD."

Thirty-three infants born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and nine infants born to HIV-1-seronegative intravenous drug-abusing mothers were followed prospectively. Infection was documented by positive virus culture. Results with the polymerase chain reaction were used for comparison. Twelve infants were found infected with HIV-1; the earliest age at which cultures became positive ranged from birth to 31 weeks of age. Of the 12 culture-positive infants, 10 had anti-HIV IgA antibodies detectable initially between birth (cord blood) and 27 weeks of age. Anti-HIV IgA was not present in the uninfected infants or in the control subjects, either by Western blot or dot blot assays. Testing for anti-HIV IgA antibodies with recombinant HIV-1 proteins is an effective method for detecting viral infection in newborn and young infants."
CD011926,0,18472434,0,Molecular epidemiology of Candida parapsilosis sepsis from outbreak investigations in neonatal intensive care units.,"The DNA probe, Cp3-13, was used in a Southern blot assay for genotyping Candida parapsilosis (CP) from 3 fungemia outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the southeastern U.S. Genotyping, in 2 outbreaks, supplied evidence of horizontal transmission of CP. In the third outbreak, bloodstream isolates (BSIs) of 2 genotypes circulated in the NICU, one was shared by a BSI and a healthcare worker's hand culture. A fourth cluster of recurrent episodes of fungemia occurred in outpatients of a children's hospital receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at home. Each child was infected with a different CP genotype which persisted during recurrences. These genotypes were included in a dendrogram from a CDC population-based surveillance for candidemia consisting of 73 clone-corrected Cp3-13 genotypes (overall SAB = 0.36). Analysis revealed a cluster of 11 genotypes (mean SAB = 0.66) including 3 pairs with identical hybridization profiles. A second cluster of 8 genotypes contained clones from 3 outbreaks (mean SAB = 0.76) but no clustering of genotypes specific for neonates was identified. No decreased susceptibility to azole and polyene antifungal agents was detected in this collection of CP. The frequent occurrence of transmission of CP in this vulnerable population underlines the relevance of Cp3-13 subtyping to investigate suspected transmission and persistence of CP strains in the NICU."

The signs and symptoms of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection are similar to those of seasonal influenza, and specific diagnostic testing is required to distinguish novel influenza A (H1N1) virus from seasonal influenza virus. It results in various degrees of infection, ranging from mild to severe to fatal. For the treatment of swine-origin influenza virus A oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective in most cases. Influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in the newborn has not been yet reported in the literature.

CD011926,0,24438366,0,Clinical relevance of positive human parechovirus type 1 and 3 PCR in stool samples.,"Human parechoviruses (HPeV) cause symptoms ranging from severe neonatal infections to mild gastrointestinal and respiratory disease. Use of PCR and genotyping has markedly improved the detection rate of HPeV but has simultaneously raised questions about the clinical relevance of positive tests. This retrospective study correlates positive HPeV1 or HPeV3 PCR tests in stools from children with their symptoms to determine clinical relevance. Children with HPeV1- or HPeV3-positive stool samples, as detected by real time RT-PCR and direct genotyping, between 2004 and 2008 were selected. Clinical data were retrospectively collected from the patient's files and results were compared. One hundred and thirty-eight children with positive HPeV1 (n = 112) or HPeV3 (n = 26) stool samples were identified. Significantly more HPeV3-infected children were neonates or infants younger than 6 months of age. Meningitis or sepsis-like illnesses were diagnosed most frequently and were found in significantly younger children. Almost half of HPeV1-infected children had an underlying disease. Mild gastrointestinal disease was seen most frequently in these children. There was no clear correlation between viral load (Ct value) and severity of symptoms. In conclusion, HPeV3 detected by PCR in stool samples is associated with clinically relevant disease. For HPeV1, a positive stool sample is mainly associated with symptoms in children with underlying disease."

Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the p24 antigen test were 100% and 99.2%, respectively. Quantification revealed RNA in 85.7% and p24 antigen in 87.4% of 230 samples from 25 infected children. Concentrations of these indices in individual samples correlated (P<.0001). Introduction or modification of antiretroviral treatment showed concordant responses of RNA and p24 antigen in 39 (90.7%) of 43 instances. The treatment-induced changes in concentrations of RNA were higher than those of p24 antigen in 11 instances. In 1 instance, however, the concentration change of p24 antigen was greater than that of RNA (P=. 002). Variation of RNA concentrations was more marked than that of p24 antigen (P=.002).

The women had CD4 lymphocyte counts>400/mm3, no AIDS-defining illness and normal pregnancies. Vaccination was well tolerated, with no significant local or systemic reactions in the women and no adverse outcomes in the infants attributable to the vaccine. Vaccination did not alter plasma RNA reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction copy number; moreover, immunization was not associated with changes in CD4 counts or HIV binding and neutralization antibody titers. Infants were followed up until 18 months of age. Five of 26 infants (19%) were HIV infected, with infection occurring in children of both vaccinated and placebo women. Analysis of factors that influence transmission did not disclose associations with immunization status, viral load, CD4 count, or maternal viral neutralization titers."

Examining the susceptibility VDR gene for CAP is essential for early intervention, prevention of related complications, and improvement of outcome. A case-control study was performed to examine the association between rs2239185 of VDR gene and CAP among children in Chinese Han population. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to genotype rs2239185 in 91 CAP children and 94 healthy children. For rs2239185, individuals with TT genotype showed a significantly higher risk of CAP than those with CC plus CT genotypes (P = 0.008). The occurrence of T allele of rs2239185 was significantly more frequent in CAP children than those in normal controls (P = 0.045).We found through stratification analysis that CAP children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), leukocyte count (WBC) >10 × 10(9)/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) >25 mg/L, procalcitonin (PCT) >2 ng/mL, and pediatric critical illness score <80 scores showed significantly higher frequency of TT genotype than those in normal controls (P = 0.0012, 0.0035, 0.0005, 0.0002, and 0.0021, respectively)."

A total of 309 fecal specimens were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and latex agglutination assay for the presence of group A rotavirus antigen. The detection rate was 26.2%. Rotavirus outbreaks showed a temperature-dependant pattern (P = .026) but no significant association with rainfall. Rotavirus strains isolated were analyzed by RNA polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were characterized antigenically by monoclonal antibodies to the VP6 subgroup. Eight RNA electropherotypes were identified, with 3 long and 5 short different RNA profiles. Among VP6 typeable strains, all isolates with a long electrophoretic pattern carried the subgroup II specificity, whereas those with a short profile belonged to subgroup I. In total, 48 rotavirus-positive samples were analyzed for G and P typing by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. A total of 8 different G and P combinations were found: G1P[8] (35.7%), G1P[6] (21.4%), G2P[4] (4.8%), G3P[4] (4.8%), G4P[6] (4.8%), G8P[8] (4.8%), G3P[8] (2.3%), and G4P[8] (2.3%).

CD011926,0,8197067,0,[Hypervariable regions (HVR) as genetic markers in tumor diagnosis. Methodological principles and their use in pathologic diagnosis].,"Variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) are highly polymorphic DNA sequences which can be used as genetic markers in different fields of medicine. In this report, we describe the methodology of VNTR in diagnostic molecular pathology, using a rapid, DNA-based approach involving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and electrophoresis of highly polymorphic DNA satellite sequences. As concrete examples of the application of this approach, we present two case reports: 1. A B-cell lymphoma of the porta hepatis developed in a 54-year-old man 4.5 months after orthotopic liver transplantation for liver failure due to chronic hepatitis C infection. Using DNA polymorphisms as genetic markers, we showed that the tumor was of donor origin. This finding may be important for the patient's subsequent management. 2. An immature teratoma of the left ovary was found during delivery by cesarean section in a 27-year-old woman. The female newborn survived for 9 weeks and then died from central dysregulation because of an intracranial immature teratoma. Because the synchronous tumors were of similar histology, clonal origin in maternal tissues and metastatic spread were initially suspected. Analysis of highly polymorphic DNA markers clearly indicated that the teratoma carried by the child was of independent genetic origin from the mother's tumor."

We investigated a nosocomial MRSA outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), using a novel typing method. Following two fatal cases, in May 2011, a prospective outbreak investigation was conducted, involving neonates, mothers and healthcare workers in a large tertiary NICU in Sydney. MRSA isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, a multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) binary typing system and other molecular typing methods. Over 7 months, 14 neonates were colonized with MRSA and six infected: three with superficial lesions and three with life-threatening disease, including the two index cases, who died despite empirical treatment with vancomycin. Isolates from 15 neonates were indistinguishable by RLB typing and identified as a PVL-producing ST22 SCCmec IV MRSA strain, which was resistant to gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. The outbreak strain was also isolated from one healthcare worker, one environmental swab and one father, but the source remained obscure. During the same period several different non-multiresistant and multiresistant MRSA strains were isolated from five neonates, five mothers (including two whose infants were colonized with the outbreak strain), one father, three healthcare workers and two environmental swabs. Rapid turnaround time of typing results allowed us to recognize and define the outbreak and implement targeted infection control interventions. PVL-producing ST22 SCCmec IV MRSA appears to be a virulent and highly transmissible pathogen in the NICU, which was difficult to control."

Concern about performance parameters (PP) of these tests as well as inappropriate antibiotic use has resulted in various recommendations regarding diagnosis of GAS. There were two objectives in this study. The first was to evaluate the rapid GAS antigen test presently in use (Thermo BioStar, Boulder, Colo.) and the GAS Direct probe test (Gen-Probe, San Diego, Calif.) compared to culture. The second was to define the optimal use of these technologies in a large acute care pediatric clinic. A total of 520 consecutive pediatric patients presenting with symptoms of pharyngitis at any of three Lahey Clinic acute care facilities were evaluated. Pharyngeal specimens were collected using a double-swab collection device (Copan, Corona, Calif.). One swab was used for the antigen test, the second was used for the probe test, and the pledget was placed in the collection device for culture on 5% sheep blood agar, incubated for 48 h anaerobically, and subsequently placed in Todd-Hewitt broth. After discrepant analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were as follows: 94.8, 100, 100, and 96.9% for the probe test and 86.1, 97.1, 93.7, and 93.4% for the antigen test, respectively. Sensitivity using an enhanced culture technique was 99.4% (163 of 164). False-positive (FP) antigen results were often seen from patients previously diagnosed and/or treated for GAS. No FP results were seen with the probe test. Colony counts for the false-negative (FN) antigen tests were higher than those for the FN probe tests. Compared to culture and DNA probe, the rapid antigen test (RAT) offered a result at the time of the patient's visit, with acceptable PP when prevalence of disease is high. Follow-up testing with the RAT of GAS patients who previously tested as positive should be avoided due to increased FP results. The probe test was comparable to culture in performance. Results indicate the probe test can be used as the primary test or as a backup to negative antigen tests. The probe test offers the advantage over culture of same-day reporting of a final result but, in contrast to a POC test, necessitates follow-up communication to the patient. Preliminary data show the specificity of the probe test to be greater than that of the RAT for patients previously diagnosed with GAS."

A report from the Italian Register.,"The aim of this report is to provide an update on the natural history of the Cri du Chat Syndrome by means of the Italian Register (I.R.). Two hundred twenty patients were diagnosed by standard cytogenetic methods and 112 of these were also characterised by molecular-cytogenetic investigation (FISH). FISH analysis showed interstitial deletions, short terminal deletions and other rare rearrangements not previously correctly diagnosed by standard cytogenetics. The diagnosis was made in the first month of life in 42% and within first year in 82% of cases. The remaining 18% were diagnosed at an age ranging from 13 months to 47 years. At the last follow-up, patient age ranged from 8 months to 61 years. Mortality, already low, has decreased over time as it is lower between 1984-2002 compared to 1965-1983. Mortality was higher in patients with unbalanced translocations resulting in 5p deletions. Our data confirm that the cat-like cry and peculiar timbre of voice are the most typical signs of the syndrome, not only at birth but also later and these are the only signs which might suggest the diagnosis in patients with small deletions and mild clinical picture. A cytogenetic and clinical variability must be underlined. Cardiac, cerebral, renal and gastrointestinal malformations were more frequent in the patients with unbalanced translocations resulting in 5p deletions. Sucking and feeding difficulties and respiratory infections are frequent in the first months or years of life. Intubation difficulties linked to larynx anomalies must be considered. Psychomotor development is delayed in all patients but there is a variability related to deletion size and type as well as other genetic and environmental factors. However, the results showed an improvement in the acquisition of the development skills and progress in social introduction which should encourage caregivers and parents to work together in carrying out the rehabilitative and educational interventions."
CD011926,0,8074933,0,Improved specificity of in vitro anti-HIV antibody production: implications for diagnosis and timing of transmission in infants born to HIV-seropositive mothers.,"In vitro anti-HIV antibody production (IVAP), initially introduced as a method for diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in infants, has been limited in its application because of poor specificity and sensitivity early in life. The aims of this study were to improve the specificity of the IVAP assay and to evaluate its sensitivity in conjunction with assays of HIV culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and p24 antigen. To prevent false-positive reactions resulting from maternal serum-derived cytophilic anti-HIV IgG, additional preculture and washing steps for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were introduced that resulted in dramatic improvement in specificity of IVAP. The sensitivity of the revised IVAP at age < 3 months in 20 infected infants was, however, only 25%; of 15 infected infants initially negative in IVAP, 13 became positive at a mean estimated age of 4.4 +/- 1.8 months. When correlated with virological assays, a failure to respond in IVAP at age < 1 month was often associated with negative virological identification, whereas a positive IVAP response at age < 3 months was always associated with positive results in all virological assays. Moreover, conversion from negative IVAP to positive responses occurred subsequent to, and not concurrently with, a positive virological identification of infected infants. The revised IVAP methodology renders this assay potentially useful as an additional tool not only for the diagnosis of HIV infection, but for estimating timing of maternal-infant HIV transmission as well."

During a one-year period, CMV-specific IgG and IgM were determined in all (n: 1027) pregnant women admitted at 8 to 20 weeks of gestation, an according to the presence or absence of anti CMV-IgM and CMV-IgG, pregnant women were classified as seropositive, seronegative and having maternal CMV infection. Differentiation of primary and recurrent CMV infection in women with both CMV-IgM (+) and CMV-IgG (+) antibody was determined by the avidity index (AI) of anti-CMV IgG. Ultrasonographic examination was done and amniocentesis was performed at 21 to 23 weeks of gestation in pregnants with primary infection. CMV DNA was investigated in the amniotic fluid by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Pregnants with recurrent infection were followed only by ultrasonography for the presence of fetal abnormalities. Neonates born to mothers with CMV infection were examined for the findings of congenital CMV infection and screened for anti- CMV-IgM, CMV DNA and CMV antigenemia in the first two weeks of life. The rate of seropositivity was found as 98.5% and the rate of seronegativity as 1.5% in pregnant women. The prevalence of maternal CMV infection was found as 1.2% and among these pregnant women, the incidence of primary and recurrent maternal CMV infection was 0.3% (3 women) and 0.8% (12 women), respectively. Congenital CMV infection was detected in one of the newborns born to mothers with primary infection while no infection was detected in any of the newborns of mothers with recurrent CMV infection, so the incidence of congenital CMV infection was found as 0.1% and the rate of intrauterine infection following the primary maternal infection was 33%. In conclusion, seroprevalence rate of CMV in pregnants is high and most (66%) infections are recurrent maternal CMV infection in our region. Thus, it does not seem to be cost-effective to screen all pregnant women for CMV infection, as in the other countries with high seropositivity rate."
CD011926,0,11015372,0,Use of a repetitive DNA probe to type clinical and environmental isolates of Aspergillus flavus from a cluster of cutaneous infections in a neonatal intensive care unit.,"Aspergillus flavus is second to A. fumigatus as a cause of invasive aspergillosis, but no standard method exists for molecular typing of strains from human sources. A repetitive DNA sequence cloned from A. flavus and subcloned into a pUC19 vector, pAF28, was used to type 18 isolates from diverse clinical, environmental, and geographic sources. The restriction fragment length polymorphisms generated with EcoRI- or PstI-digested genomic DNA and probed with digoxigenin-labeled pAF28 revealed complete concordance between patterns. Eighteen distinct fingerprints were observed. The probe was used to investigate two cases of cutaneous A. flavus infection in low-birth-weight infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Both infants were transported by the same ambulance and crew to the NICU on the same day. A. flavus strains of the same genotype were isolated from both infants, from a roll of tape used to fasten their umbilical catheters, from a canvas bag used to store the tape in the ambulance, and from the tape tray in the ambulance isolette. These cases highlight the need to consider exposures in critically ill neonates that might occur during their transport to the NICU and for stringent infection control practices. The hybridization profiles of strains from a second cluster of invasive A. flavus infections in two pediatric hematology-oncology patients revealed a genotype common to strains from a definite case patient and a health care worker. A probable case patient was infected with a strain with a genotype different from that of the strain from the definite case patient but highly related to that of an environmental isolate. The high degree of discrimination and reproducibility obtained with the pAF28 probe underscores its utility for typing clinical and environmental isolates of A. flavus."

CD011926,0,9740505,0,Diagnosis of congenital Toxoplasma gondii infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on amniotic fluid samples. The Norwegian experience.,"As part of a screening project for detection of Toxoplasma gondii infection among pregnant women in Norway, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) aimed at the detection of T. gondii in amniotic fluid samples was included in the diagnostic routine. The results were compared with the routine criteria for congenital infection: i) T. gondii detected in amniotic fluid or cord blood by mouse inoculation, ii) specific IgM or IgA in serum collected after birth, and/or iii) specific IgG persisting beyond one year of age. The PCR was based on the B1 gene with an internal control gene amplified together with the B1 gene. One hundred and two amniotic fluid samples collected during pregnancy and/or at delivery from 67 pregnant women with serological evidence of primary T. gondii infection were available for examination by both B1-PCR and mouse inoculation. Six samples were positive and 86 samples were negative by both methods (90% concordance). One sample was mouse inoculation positive and B1-PCR negative while nine samples were B1-PCR positive and mouse inoculation negative, of which five were associated with four infants without proven infection. 59%, and 41% of samples associated with infected infants were positive by B1-PCR and mouse inoculation, respectively. The difference was mainly due to a lower detection rate by mouse inoculation after antiparasitic treatment. The specificity of B1-PCR was 94%. Even though B1-PCR performed on amniotic fluid samples did not detect all infected infants, it represented a valuable tool in addition to conventional methods in the diagnosis of congenital T. gondii infection."
CD011926,0,24880684,0,Dominance of clonal complex 10 among the levofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from bacteremic patients in a Korean hospital.,"Streptococcus agalactiae has emerged as an important cause of invasive infection in adults. Forty-nine S. agalactiae isolates (41 from adults and 8 from neonates) were collected during a 4-year period (2010-2013) and analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Antibiotic susceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin and levofloxacin was determined and the determinants of resistance (ermA, ermB, ermC, mefA, lnuB) were detected by PCR and mutation in gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene was investigated by sequence analysis. They were resolved into 14 sequence types (STs) and belonged to five clonal complexes (CCs). The distribution of CC was significantly different according to the age group; CC1 (18/41) and CC10 (13/41) was the most common among the adult isolates but CC19 (5/8) was predominant among the neonatal isolates. The resistance rate to erythromycin, clindamycin was 18.4% and 24.5%, respectively. Among the 13 strains resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin, two isolates harbored ermA and 10 isolates harbored ermB. The levofloxacin resistance rate was very high (32.7%) and was significantly higher in CC10 (71.4%). All the levofloxacin-resistant isolates had identical gyrA substitution (Ser81Leu) but parC substitution was different according to the CCs. The additional mutation in parE (His221Tyr) was found only in CC19. Continuous monitoring of the fluoroquinolone resistance and genotypic distribution among S. agalactiae is needed."
CD011926,0,11316071,0,Analysis of alloreactivity and intragraft cytokine profiles in living donor liver transplant recipients with graft acceptance.,"Although some previous studies have indicated the possibility of immunosuppression withdrawal in clinical liver transplantation, the mechanism of graft acceptance is not clear. The aim of this study is to elucidate the alloreactivity against the donor and intragraft cytokine profiles in living donor liver transplant (LDLT) recipients with graft acceptance. In October 1999, we had 23 patients who survived without immunosuppression after LDLT with a median drug-free period of 25 months (range: 3-69 months). They consisted of six patients who were electively weaned by an elective weaning protocol and 17 either forcibly or accidentally weaned patients due to various causes but mainly due to infection. We evaluated the alloreactivity against the donor in these patients by a mixed lymphocyte reaction and intragraft cytokine profiles by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The development of donor-specific hyporeactivity was observed in the patients with graft acceptance. The cytokine pattern in the supernatant of the culture medium revealed a down regulation of T helper (Th) 1 cytokine INF gamma against the donor while no significant difference was seen in Th2 cytokine IL-10. Regarding the intragraft cytokine profiles, we could find no amplification of Thl cytokines (IL-2, INF y) and IL-4 while some of the patients revealed a gene expression of IL-10 with no significant difference from that of the normal, untransplanted liver specimen. In addition, no difference was observed in any other cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-8, IL-15, TNFalpha) compared with those of the normal controls. We propose that the down regulation of Th1 cytokine is one possible mechanism of graft acceptance in LDLT recipients."

CD011926,0,25756041,0,Comparative analysis of quinolone resistance in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli from Chinese children and adults.,"The objective of this study was to compare quinolone resistance and gyrA mutations in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli from Chinese adults who used quinolone in the preceding month and children without any known history of quinolone administration. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 61 isolates from children and 79 isolates from adults were determined. The mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions in gyrA gene were detected by PCR and DNA sequencing. Fluoroquinolone resistance and types of gyrA mutations in isolates from children and adults were compared and statistically analyzed. No significant differences were detected in the resistance rates of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin between children and adults among isolates of the two species (all P > 0.05). The double mutation Ser83→Leu + Asp87→Asn in the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates occurred in 73.7% isolates from the children and 67.9% from the adults, respectively (P = 0.5444). Children with no known history of quinolone administration were found to carry fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. The occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance and the major types of gyrA mutations in the isolates from the children were similar to those from adults. The results indicate that precautions should be taken on environmental issues resulting from widespread transmission of quinolone resistance."

CD011926,0,10619733,0,Outbreak of a multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an intensive care unit: antibiotic use as risk factor for colonization and infection.,"An observational study was undertaken to describe a nosocomial outbreak caused by multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MRKP). Ten patients in the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) at a hospital in Madrid were colonized by or infected with MRKP from October 1997 to April 1998. Thirty-two patients with MRKP-negative surveillance cultures who were admitted to the ICU during the outbreak period were selected as control patients. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis of MRKP isolates revealed patterns that were indistinguishable from each other. After identification of colonized patients by surveillance cultures and implementation of standard and contact precautions, the outbreak was controlled. An age <12 weeks (odds ratio [OR], 13.1) and previous treatment with third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides (OR, 31.2) were independently associated with MRKP colonization and/or infection. Individual exposure to antibiotics, irrespective of other clinical determinants, is a risk factor for MRKP acquisition. Screening high-risk patients during outbreaks and reducing the use of third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides contribute to the control of these epidemics."

CD011926,0,10191353,0,Isovaleric acidemia with promyelocytic myeloproliferative syndrome.,"Isovaleric acidemia, an autosomal recessive disorder, is due to isovaleryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency and is one of the branched-chain aminoacidopathies. Isovaleric acidemia may present in the neonatal period with an acute episode of severe metabolic acidosis, ketosis, and vomiting and may lead to coma and death in the first 2 months of life. This report concerns an infant who presented at 10 days of age because of lethargy, poor feeding, hypothermia, cholestasis, and thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and profound pancytopenia. Death occurred at 19 days of age. Autopsy showed mild fatty change in the liver and extramedullary hematopoiesis, generalized Escherichia coli sepsis, and myelodysplasia of the bone marrow with arrest of the myeloid series at the promyelocytic stage. The appearance resembled promyelocytic leukemia, but the diagnostic 15:17 translocation was not present. The maturation arrest in granulopoiesis in isovaleric acidemia appears to be most likely due to a direct metabolic effect on granulocyte precursor cells."
CD011926,0,8922802,0,Congenital toxoplasmosis transmitted from an immunologically competent mother infected before conception.,"Congenital transmission of Toxoplasma gondii from a mother who was apparently immunologically competent and who had toxoplasmic lymphadenitis 2 months before conception is described. Since no T. gondii-specific serological data were available for this mother from the time her lymph node biopsy specimen was obtained, the specimen was studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine whether the T. gondii B1 gene was present. The predictive diagnostic value of histologic findings previously considered to be classic signs of T. gondii lymphadenitis also was studied. This was done by correlation of serological tests diagnostic of acute acquired T. gondii infection and presence of characteristic findings in biopsy specimens from persons without known immunocompromise. Both PCR and review of the characteristic features of her lymph node biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of preconceptual infection in the mother. We also discuss two other cases in which apparently immunologically competent mothers with preconceptually acquired infection transmitted this parasite to their fetuses."

Regions suited for the development of specific, probe-confirmable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were selected. PCR assays were evaluated with respect to sensitivity and specificity, the latter in comparison with a number of G. vaginalis reference strains and closely related species like Bifidobacterium spp. In an initial diagnostic study it appeared that the PCR test detected G. vaginalis in 40% of women irrespective of their clinical status. Ten out of 11 patients suffering from bacterial vaginosis as defined on the basis of clinical parameters were carrying G. vaginalis."
CD011926,0,19031470,0,Identification and characterization of enteric adenoviruses in infants and children hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis.,"Enteric adenoviruses are important etiological agents associated with sporadic infections and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in infants and children. Fecal samples were collected from 439 hospitalized patients in the years 2005-2007 from Pune, Aurangabad, and Nagpur cities of western India to identify the most prevalent strains of enteric adenoviruses. The viruses were detected by PCR and characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The prevalence of enteric adenoviruses in patients from Pune, Aurangabad and Nagpur was found to be 9% (10/111), 7% (7/100), and 7.5% (17/228), respectively. Sequence based analysis of the partial hexon and/or fiber genes showed the presence of adenovirus serotypes 40, 41, and 31 and variations at the subgenus and strain level. Phylogenetic analysis of the adenovirus strains indicated 98-100% homology with adenovirus 40 of the UK, 96-99% with adenovirus 41 of the USA and 94-100% with adenovirus 31 of Austria. The study indicates circulation of enteric adenovirus serotypes 40 and 41 with an unreported serotype 31 in sporadic cases of gastroenteritis. This is the first report from India on the association of enteric adenoviruses with acute gastroenteritis."

CD011926,0,26155982,0,Incidence of CMV co-infection in HIV-positive women and their neonates in a tertiary referral centre: a cohort study.,"Co-infection with CMV in HIV-positive pregnant women is associated with perinatal mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of both viruses. This retrospective study reports on the incidence of maternal and neonatal CMV (presence of anti-CMV IgG and IgM, CMV DNA PCR and/or CMV virus isolation) in high-risk pregnancies due to maternal HIV infection, MTCT of HIV and/or CMV. One hundred and eleven maternal samples and 75 matched neonatal samples were available for HIV and subsequent CMV testing. In this cohort of HIV-positive pregnant women, 96 (86.5 %) serum samples were anti-CMV IgG positive. In nine (9.4 %) of these, anti-CMV IgM was detected, and in none of them a maternal primary CMV infection was suspected. Fifty-seven (51.8 %) maternal serum samples were tested retrospectively by CMV DNA PCR; one sample was positive (0.9 %). All matched neonates were tested for HIV by PCR in the first month of life; HIV transmission was detected in one case. In 74 (67.2 %) of neonates, CMV testing was performed. Sixty-six of these serum samples were tested retrospectively by CMV DNA PCR. Two newborns (2.7 %) showed laboratory markers for CMV infection (one by detection of CMV DNA in plasma, and one by isolation of CMV from a urine sample). In the follow-up, neither of these two showed clinical signs for active CMV disease. We discussed these findings in the light of the national official guidelines. All CMV transmissions occurred due to maternal reinfection or endogenous reactivation. This suggests the success of highly active antiretroviral therapy in preventing MTCT of HIV and CMV disease and highlights the importance of adequate care and follow-up."
CD011926,0,8253976,0,"Comparison of polymerase chain reaction, culture, and western immunoblot serology for diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis infection.","Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the pertussis toxin promoter region was used to detect Bordetella pertussis infection in nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from 24 infants and children infected with pertussis and 13 adult contacts during an epidemiological study. The sensitivity of this PCR assay was approximately one bacterium, and the assay was specific for B. pertussis in tests with other Bordetella species and other respiratory pathogens. The pertussis case definition required a cough with a duration of more than 21 days for infants and children and laboratory confirmation by serology as the primary detection method for infants, children, and adults. The sensitivity of PCR and culture on Bordet-Gengou agar medium was assessed with regard to the case definitions. In the group of infants and children (index cases), the sensitivities of the culture and the PCR were 54.1% (13 of 24) and 95.8% (23 of 24), respectively. In the adult group (household contacts), the sensitivities of the two methods were 15.4% (2 of 13) and 61.5% (8 of 13), respectively. PCR combined with pertussis-specific serology appears to be a useful tool for diagnosis of pertussis especially in epidemiological studies."

CD011926,0,8735082,0,Genomic fingerprinting for epidemiological differentiation of Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates.,"We used genomic fingerprinting to investigate an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of two hospitals. The hospitals are located in the same city and are part of the same medical care system. Fingerprinting was done by Southern blot hybridization with DNA probes for the genes encoding the S. aureus collagen adhesin (cna), fibronectin-binding proteins (fnbA and fnbB), and beta-toxin (hlb). Genomic DNA was digested with HaeIII (cna and fnbA-fnbB probes) or HindIII (hlb probe). Hybridization patterns could be distinguished on the basis of (i) the presence or absence of cna, (ii) the size of the restriction fragment containing the cna gene, (iii) restriction fragment length polymorphisms within fnbA and fnbB, (iv) the presence of a lysogenic phage within hlb, and (v) the sizes of the restriction fragments containing the phage-bacterial DNA junction fragments. Over a period of 4 months we examined a total of 46 isolates obtained from various wards within each hospital. Among these 46 isolates, we observed a total of 4 cna patterns, 11 fnbA-fnbB patterns, and 11 hlb patterns. Southern blots with HaeIII-digested genomic DNA and a combination of all three gene probes revealed a total of 16 clearly distinguishable patterns. A total of 22 of the 46 isolates were identical with respect to every genomic marker examined. A total of 21 of these 22 isolates were obtained from patients within an NICU. Nineteen of 21 isolates also exhibited identical antibiotic resistance profiles (antibiogram). Although 5 of the remaining 24 strains exhibited an antibiogram identical to those of the NICU isolates, all 24 strains could be distinguished from the NICU isolates by at least one genomic marker. These results suggest that the NICU isolates had a common origin and that genomic fingerprinting with the cna, fnbA, fnbB, and hlb gene probes can provide an important epidemiological tool for the identification of clinical isolates of S. aureus."
CD011926,0,2922373,0,Detection of rubella virus in fetal and placental tissues and in the throats of neonates after serologically confirmed rubella in pregnancy.,"From 35 therapeutic abortions performed because rubella had occurred at 2-19 weeks of pregnancy, 120 fetal organs, 12 specimens of mixed products of conception, and 15 placentae were tested for rubella virus. Virus was isolated from 10 out of 11 fetuses (91 per cent) from women infected at 2-8 weeks, from 5 out of 8 (63 per cent) infected at 9-10 weeks, and from 2 out of 16 (13 per cent) infected at 11-19 weeks. Hybridization tests for viral RNA on 39 fetal organs from eight cases revealed infection in four additional fetuses. Virus was isolated from only 3 out of 15 aborted placentae, but hybridization tests on six placentae revealed infection in three additional specimens. Hybridization was superior to virus isolation for detecting rubella infection in products of conception and is therefore potentially the better method for examining chorionic villus biopsies. Rubella virus was isolated from the throats of 4 out of 9 infants (44 per cent) infected during the first 12 weeks of gestation, but from none of 13 infected after 17 weeks. Infants in the latter group are unlikely to infect susceptible contacts."

It was soon shown that HTLV-II was endemic among Amerindians and particularly among Brazilian Indians. The Amazon Region of Brazil is presently the largest endemic area for this virus and has allowed several studies concerning virus biology, the search for overt disease, epidemiological data including detailed demographic data on infected individuals, clear-cut geographic distribution, definition of modes of transmission and maintenance within small, epidemiologically-closed groups, and advances in laboratory diagnosis of the infection. A new molecular subtype named HTLV-IIc was further described on the basis of genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. This subtype is present in other areas of Brazil, indicating that the virus is additionally both a valuable marker for tracing past human migration routes in the Americas and a probable marker for social habits of the present human population. HIV, the other human retrovirus, is still not prevalent among indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon, but these groups are also easy targets for the virus."

CD011926,0,12037063,0,"Effectiveness of reverse transcription-PCR, virus isolation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of influenza A virus infection in different age groups.","The degrees of effectiveness of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, virus isolation, and antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of influenza A virus were evaluated with nasopharyngeal swabs from 150 patients (1 week to 86 years old) with influenza A virus infection. RT-PCR had a sensitivity for influenza A virus in stock virus preparations 10(3) times higher than virus isolation and 10(6) to 10(7) times higher than ELISA. The detection rate achieved by RT-PCR in clinical samples was clearly higher (93%) than that by virus isolation (80%) and ELISA (62%). Despite low overall detection rates achieved by antigen ELISA, samples from patients younger than 5 years old yielded higher-than-average rates in this rapid assay (88%). The likelihood of negative results in the ELISA increased significantly with increasing age of the patient (P < 0.01). The degrees of effectiveness of RT-PCR and virus isolation were not influenced by the age of the patient. Neither influenza immunizations nor the interval between onset of symptoms and laboratory investigation (mean, 4.7 days; standard deviation, 3.3 days) affected results obtained by the three test systems. Our results demonstrate that the ELISA is reliable for rapid laboratory diagnosis of influenza in infants and young children, but for older patients application of RT-PCR or virus isolation is necessary to avoid false negative results."

CD011926,0,21896155,0,Levels of periodontal pathogens in neonatal gastric aspirates and possible maternal sites of origin.,"Maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. It is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. This study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythia were not observed in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. Interestingly, Porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98E+02 and 1.75E+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with Fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32E+03 cells ml(-1). Although F. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains."
CD011926,0,15380688,0,Fitness of Toxoplasma gondii is not related to DHFR single-nucleotide polymorphism during congenital toxoplasmosis.,"Factors that regulate the pathogenesis of Toxoplasma gondii in humans are poorly understood. When acquired during pregnancy, toxoplasmosis can be disastrous, leading to fetal loss or conversely to subclinical disease. In congenitally infected infants, evolution is highly unpredictable. Genotype based virulence patterns have been described in mice, but in humans this classification does not correlate with the gravity of the disease. Mutations on DHFR-TS loci have recently been reported to confer T. gondii fitness cost. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the virulence of the parasite, as measured by clinical outcome in the fetus or newborn, fitness, as measured by parasitic load in amniotic fluid, and allelic polymorphism in DHFR. Six cases of severe congenital toxoplasmosis and 23 cases of mild congenital infections were included in the study. Quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate total T. gondii DNA load in amniotic fluid and detection of mutations was carried out with a LightCycler using hybridisation probes. Parasitic load was significantly higher in severe infections than in mild diseases. Among isolates from severe or non-severe cases of congenital toxoplasmosis, no polymorphism could be detected at loci 36, 83 or 245 of the DHFR gene. The virulent RH strain presented the same melting temperature as the non-virulent PRU strain for codons 36, 83 and 245. Only mutated clones, M2M3 and M2M4 with allelic replacement at these positions, displayed different profiles allowing a clear distinction between wild and mutant types. We concluded that the DHFR gene mutations we investigated do not regulate T. gondii fitness in humans."

Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes illnesses ranging from mild respiratory problems to bronchiolitis and severe pneumonia. From January to December 2007, 220 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children younger ≤ 13 years old hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infection to detect hMPV by revese transcription-polymerase chain reaction and to clone and sequence the hMPV-positive samples. Human metapneumovirus was detected in 28 (12.7%) specimens with a median age of 7 months (range 1.3 to 24 months). Human metapneumovirus type A and type B were detected in 26 (93%) and 8 (28.6%) of specimens, respectively. Coinfection with hMPV type A and type B was detected in 6 (21.4%) specimens positive for hMPV. The major clinical diagnosis of hMPV-positive patients was bronchiolitis (75%). Human metapneumovirus and hMPV type B were found to be significantly associated with bronchiolitis (P = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). Human metapneumovirus and hMPV type A were found to be significantly associated with pneumonia (P = 0.004 and 0.002, respectively). The main symptoms in patients infected with hMPV were cough (92.9%), fever (82.1%), and wheezing (78.6%), with a significant association of hMPV type A with fever (P = 0.018). Human metapneumovirus was seasonally distributed; most infections with hMPV were reported in the late winter and early spring. The peak of hMPV incidence was in February (10/28; 35.7%). Sequencing of purified plasmid DNA was performed in forward and reverse direction to confirm the results of hMPV-positive samples which scored 97% identity to hMPV type A genome isolate NL/17/00 and showing C-T variation that had no effect on the amino acid sequence F(Phe)-F(Phe)."

CD011926,0,12696113,0,Infantile viral gastroenteritis: on the way to closing the diagnostic gap.,"A total of 305 faecal specimens collected from children under the age of 5 who presented with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis either as inpatients at Addenbrooke's Hospital (N = 100) or to General Practitioners in East Anglia (N = 205) during 1999-2001 were tested for the presence of rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, enteric adenoviruses (Group F, serotypes 40 and 41), and astrovirus. An aetiologic agent was found in 184 specimens (60.3%). The most commonly found single viral pathogen was rotavirus (27.9%), followed by norovirus (13.4%), enteric adenoviruses (7.9%), astrovirus (2.3%), and sapovirus (1%). Mixed infections were observed in 27 specimens (8.9%), and no aetiologic agent was found in over a third of the specimens tested. These data demonstrate that the diagnostic gap can be reduced considerably through the use of molecular amplification and detection techniques. However, additional work is required to reduce this deficit further by optimising sampling algorithms and by identifying other agents associated with viral gastroenteritis."
CD011926,0,23481105,0,Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections.,"Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections are uncommon, but because of the morbidity and mortality associated with the infection they are often considered in the differential diagnosis of ill neonates. The use of polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of central nervous system infections and the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy has revolutionized the diagnosis and management of these infants. Initiation of long-term antiviral suppressive therapy in these infants has led to significant improvement in morbidity. This article summarizes the epidemiology of neonatal herpes simplex virus infections and discusses clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and follow up of infants with neonatal herpes disease."
CD011926,0,19579690,0,Simultaneous detection of viruses and Toxoplasma gondii in cerebrospinal fluid specimens by multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based reverse hybridization assay.,"The lack of rapidity and the low sensitivity and specificity of traditional laboratory methods limits their usefulness in the laboratory diagnosis of viral central nervous system (CNS) infections. This study describes the use of a commercially available multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR)-based reverse hybridization assay (RHA) for the simultaneous detection of the genomes of 8 viruses and Toxoplasma gondii in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from 181 patients suspected of having viral meningitis. Twenty-two/181 (12.15%) CSF samples resulted positive by mPCR. Eighteen/22 were positive for 1 viral pathogen, whereas a dual infection was detected in 4/22 samples. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the most commonly detected virus (6/22), followed by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) (5/22) and -2 (HSV-2) (4/22). Cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were detected in 1 specimen each. Two CSF samples were co-infected by HSV-1/HSV-2, 1 sample by HHV-6/T. gondii, and 1 sample by EBV/EV, respectively. Our data support the usefulness of mPCR as a rapid molecular method for the simultaneous detection of major viral pathogens and T. gondii in aseptic meningitis also to allow the earlier application of specific antiviral therapy."

The hereditary mechanism was X-linked in three cases and autosomal recessive in the other three. Clinical manifestations appeared before the age of 2 years in all cases; the illness appeared earlier in males, and was more severe, consisting of bacterial infections such as abscesses in the liver, lungs or skin, suppurating lymphadenitis and mastoiditis. None of the patients had osteomyelitis. The germs isolated were bacteria (Staphylococcus, Salmonella, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus) and fungi (Candida, Aspergillus, Trichopyton). Orientative complementary evidence was intense leukocytosis, high levels of acute phase reactants (PCR and VSG), polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and high LB ant LT4 levels. Definitive diagnosis was provided by the NBT test and chemiluminescence in all cases."

To determine the prevalence of these amoeba infections in Santa Rosa de Agua (Maracaibo, Zulia State, Venezuela), a PCR assay using specific primers for each species was standardized and applied. 204 stool samples were analyzed through direct microscopic examination with SSF (0.85%) and lugol, formol-ether concentration, and PCR. Under direct microscopy, 42 individuals (20.58%) presented the E. histolytica/E. dispar complex. Meanwhile PCR showed 47 positive cases for these amoebas: 22 E. histolytica (10.78%), 16 E. dispar (7.84%), and 9 (4.41%) mixed infections. There was no significant difference in the presence of E. histolytica and/or E. dispar according to either gender or age. There were no cases of these amoebas in children under 2 years of age. Observed frequency of E. histolytica (31/204) shows the endemic nature of amoeba infection in this community."
CD011926,0,11376479,0,Advances in the treatment of neonatal herpes simplex infections.,"Neonatal HSV disease is a potentially devastating illness with significant mortality and morbidity. Collaborative research efforts over the past 25 years have provided therapeutic options that were beyond hope just a generation ago. The use of high-dose acyclovir for the treatment of acute neonatal HSV disease has reduced mortality rates to their lowest level ever. Application of PCR to clinical specimens from neonates suspected of having neonatal HSV infection largely has eliminated the need to perform invasive brain biopsies, while at the same time providing a new tool with which to re-define the natural history of neonatal HSV disease. A limitation of PCR is the lack of standardisation in methodologies from laboratory to laboratory, which can impede a clinician's ability to interpret the PCR results. As such, all test results, including those from PCR, must be evaluated in the context of the patient's medical condition. Areas for continued research for further means of improvement in disease outcome include raising awareness of neonatal HSV disease so that the time between disease onset and the initiation of antiviral therapy can be shortened, as well as the evaluation of monoclonal antibodies as adjunctive therapy to high-dose acyclovir. Utilisation of suppressive oral acyclovir following acute neonatal disease is another therapeutic option under clinical investigation with the potential to improve morbidity outcomes of neonatal HSV disease survivors."

It is very important to have a convenient and accurate method for pathogenic diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. We developed a method of simultaneous detection and Gram classification of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens causing sepsis directly from blood samples with Gram stain-specific-probe-based real-time PCR (GSPBRT-PCR). With GSPBRT-PCR, 53 clinically important strains representing 25 gram-positive and 28 gram-negative bacterial species were identified correctly with the corresponding Gram probe. The limits of the GSPBRT-PCR assay in serial dilutions of the bacteria revealed that Staphylococcus aureus could be detected at concentrations of 3 CFU per PCR and Escherichia coli at concentrations as low as 1 CFU per PCR. The GSPBRT-PCR assay was further evaluated on 600 blood specimens from patients with suspicion of neonatal sepsis and compared to the results obtained from blood cultures. The positive rate of the GSPBRT-PCR array was 50/600 (8.33%), significantly higher than that of blood culture (34/600; 5.67%) (P = 0.00003). When blood culture was used as a control, the sensitivity of GSPBRT-PCR was 100%, the specificity was 97.17%, and the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.972. This study suggests that GSPBRT-PCR is very useful for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of bacterial infection and that it can have an important impact on the current inappropriate and unnecessary use of antibiotics in the treatment of newborns."
CD011926,0,8927279,0,[Maternal-fetal transmission of human papillomavirus].,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is one of the most frequently observed sexually-transmitted diseases (10-60% of the general population). In pregnant women, as well as accelerating the evolution of dysplasia to cervical cancer, the infection may be transmitted to the fetus during gestation or at the time of birth. Children who have been infected at birth may develop laryngeal papillomatosis during the first 5 years of life that may, in some cases, spread to the point of causing aphonia or severe respiratory obstruction. There is also the risk, although it is very low, of a carcinomatous degeneration of the larynx in these subjects during adulthood. The hypothesis of the present study was to verify the prevalence of HPV infection in a population of pregnant women and the prevalence of maternal-fetal transmission."

Aim of the current study was to investigate HCV vertical transmission rate in children born to 30 HCV positive/HIV negative pregnant women in Italy. We investigated the potential vertical transmission of HCV by identifying HCV antibody seropositive pregnant women, by analyzing HCV-RNA in the peripheral blood using PCR and by prospectively following their offspring until 24 months of age. During the third trimester, 2,980 consecutive pregnant women were examined for anti-HCV antibodies by a second generation Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (EIA2) and re-assayed by a second generation Recombinant Immunoblot Assay (RIBA2). A total of 32 mothers (1.07%) were positive for EIA2 test; 30 out of 32 had a reactive confirmatory RIBA2 test for HCV. All anti-HCV positive mothers were negative for HIV. These 30 mothers and their 30 babies formed the study cohort. Of the 30 anti-HCV positive mothers, 10 were also positive for serum HCV-RNA by PCR. All the babies born to the 30 anti-HCV positive mothers were initially negative for HCV-RNA (cord blood specimens), but three babies became positive at three months of age and remained positive thereafter. These babies had been born to 3 of the 10 mothers with viremia during the third trimester of pregnancy. These results suggest that HCV vertical transmission is possible in 10% of anti-HCV positives and in about 33% of the HCV-RNA seropositive mothers."
CD011926,0,2060515,0,Repeated polymerase chain reaction complementary to other conventional methods for early detection of HIV infection in infants born to HIV-infected mothers.,"The efficacy of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for early detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in infants at risk for HIV infection was assessed. The PCR method was added to the routine laboratory test programme in these patients in 1988. PCR was performed in a total of 26 children at risk (age range 2 days to 58 months), including 17 infants born to HIV-infected mothers, who were followed up clinically from the time of birth for a mean period of 23 months (range 6 to 54) in a prospective study. Twelve children were PCR-positive. Eight had AIDS, ARC or symptoms suggestive of HIV infection. All these patients had at least one culture positive for HIV (6/8) and/or one positive serum p24-antigen test (5/8). One child was repeatedly PCR positive, but asymptomatic as well as virus- and antigen-negative. Three asymptomatic children with a single positive PCR result were PCR negative in subsequent tests. Fourteen children with negative PCR did not show clinical or immunological signs suggestive of HIV infection. Their cultures for HIV and antigen-p24 assays were negative. It is concluded that in addition to clinical and immunological parameters PCR is a useful technique for diagnosis of HIV infection in infants born to HIV-infected mothers. However, in case of negative HIV cultures and/or serum p24-antigen tests, single positive PCR results in asymptomatic patients must be interpreted with caution and should be confirmed by repeated tests."
CD011926,0,23274752,0,A novel method of real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification developed for rapid and quantitative detection of human astrovirus.,"A one-step, real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (rRT-LAMP) method targeting the 5' end of the capsid gene for rapid and quantitative detection of human astrovirus serotype 1 (HAstV 1) was developed. The assay is highly sensitive and comparable to real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), with a detection limit of ∼100 RNA copies per assay. The specificity of the method was validated by the absence of any cross-reaction with RNA samples of HAstV 2-8 and other gastroenteritis viruses, followed by nucleotide sequencing of the amplified product. Fecal specimens (n=120) obtained from children under five years of age with gastroenteritis were tested by rRT-LAMP, rRT-PCR and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Six (5%) of these samples were determined to be positive by both rRT-LAMP and rRT-PCR assay, and these two nucleic acid amplification methods resulted in a 200% increase in detection rates for HAstV infection compared with TEM alone. Furthermore, the rRT-LAMP assay is much more rapid than rRT-PCR and generates results in less than 20min for positive samples. The quantitation of viral load in stool specimens was determined from the standard curve plot of time-of-positivity versus initial RNA concentration. Most viral loads were determined to be within the range of 10(5)-10(8) copies. The results highlight the significance of the rapid rRT-LAMP method as a diagnostic and routine screening tool for the analysis of stool samples in hospital laboratories."

The majority of natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. However, there always only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. The aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of BF on endotracheal tube (ETT), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections."

CD011926,0,26254559,0,Possible role of TLR4 and TLR9 SNPs in protection against congenital toxoplasmosis.,"The purpose of this investigation was the determination of the distribution of genotypes at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in fetuses and newborns congenitally infected with Toxoplasma gondii and the identification of genetic changes predisposing to infection development. The study involved 20 fetuses and newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis and 50 uninfected controls. The levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against T. gondii, as well as IgG avidity, were estimated by enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA) tests. T. gondii DNA loads in amniotic fluids were assayed by the real-time (RT) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q PCR) technique for parasitic B1 gene. TLR4 and TLR9 SNPs were identified using a self-designed multiplex nested PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. Randomly selected genotypes at SNPs were confirmed by sequencing. All the genotypes were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and TLR4 genotypes were analyzed for linkage disequilibrium. A correlation was studied between the genotypes or haplotypes and the development of congenital toxoplasmosis using a logistic regression model. Single SNP analysis showed no statistically significant differences in the distribution of distinct genotypes at the analyzed TLR4 and TLR9 SNPs between T. gondii-infected fetuses and newborns and the controls. Taking into account the prevalence of alleles residing within polymorphic sites, similar prevalence rates were observed in both of the studied groups. The multiple SNP analysis indicated GTG variants at the TLR4 and TLR9 SNPs to be significantly less frequent in offspring with congenital toxoplasmosis than in uninfected offspring (p ≤ 0.0001). TLR4 and TLR9 SNPs seem to be involved in protection against congenital toxoplasmosis."

Escherichia coli is an emerging agent among pathogens that cause diarrhea. The development of a highly applicable technique for the detection of different categories of diarrheagenic E. coli is important. We have used multiplex PCR by combining eight primer pairs specific for enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). This facilitates the identification of five different categories of diarrheagenic E. coli from stool samples in a single reaction simultaneously. The prevalences of diarrheagenic E. coli were 22.5 and 12% in the diarrhea group and the control group, respectively. Among 587 fecal samples from Vietnamese children under 5 years of age with diarrhea, this technique identified 132 diarrheagenic E. coli strains. This included 68 samples (11.6%) with EAEC, 12 samples (2.0%) with EIEC, 39 samples (6.6%) with EPEC, and 13 samples (2.2%) with ETEC. Among the 249 age-matched controls, 30 samples were positive for diarrheagenic E. coli. The distribution was 18 samples (7.2%) with EAEC, 11 samples (4.4%) with EPEC, and 1 sample (0.4%) with ETEC."

These strains showed different drug resistance patterns and plasmid profiles. Analysis of endonuclease restriction fragments of chromosomal DNA by hybridization with E. coli rRNA has demonstrated that a single bacterial clone or its derivatives were responsible for the outbreak. Furthermore, the study of 139 strains, isolated since 1970 from different geographic locations of the Mediterranean area, has confirmed a notable degree of homogeneity within Wien serovar, even though the detection of genetic polymorphisms in some isolates suggests that a number of distinct bacterial strains contributes to maintain the circulation of Wien serovar."

Restriction fragment length polymorphism of rrn operons (rrn RFLP) in these isolates was compared with that of the 72 strains of the ECOR reference collection. Distributions of K1 antigen, of polymerase chain reaction-detected ibe10 gene, pap, afa, sfa/foc, hly, and aer operons, and of a 14.9-kb rrn-containing HindIII fragment previously associated with neonatal meningitis were compared. Oligoclonality was observed for the meningitis strains. Factorial analysis of correspondence on the rrn RFLP data showed a frequency gradient of meningitis strains from the phylogenetic B2 group (68%) to the A group (6%), via the D and B1 groups (26%). The distribution of the virulence determinants argues for their horizontal transfer during the evolution of E. coli. Analysis of the status of some neonates further suggests that neonatal meningitis results from a balance between bacterial genes of virulence and host factors."

It is not applicable for developing countries. We conducted a study to evaluate the effect of zidovudine treatment in late pregnancy on HIV-1 in utero transmission. Fifty cases of asymptomatic HIV-1 infected-women were voluntarily enrolled to the study. Zidovudine 250 mg orally twice a day was given to these patients from gestational age 36 weeks until labour. The newborns were evaluated at birth by a neonatologist and peripheral blood was tested for HIV genome by PCR technique within 48 hours of birth.

CD011926,0,26193371,0,Salivirus in Children and Its Association with Childhood Acute Gastroenteritis: A Paired Case-Control Study.,"Salivirus was recently discovered in children with gastroenteritis and in sewage. Though a causative role for salivirus in childhood gastroenteritis was suggested in the previous study, the relationship between salivirus and acute gastroenteritis has not yet been clearly clarified. The sewage strain reported by Ng, although represented by incomplete genome sequencing data, was distinct from previously reported saliviruses, and had not previously been detected in humans. A case-control study examining 461 paired stool samples from children with diarrhea and healthy controls (1:1) was conducted in this study. Also, common diarrheal viruses were detected and complete genome of a salivirus was determined. Results showed that salivirus was detected in 16 (3.5%) and 13 (2.8%) of the case and control samples, respectively; no differences in detection rates (p=0.571) or mean values of viral loads (p=0.400) were observed between the groups. Multivariate Cox regression revealed no association between salivirus and gastroenteritis (p=0.774). The data also demonstrated that salivirus infection did not exacerbate clinical symptoms of gastroenteritis in children. Furthermore, complete genome sequence of a salivirus recovered from the feces of a child with diarrhea (i.e., SaliV-FHB) shared a 99% nucleotide identity with the sewage strain. In conclusion, a paired case-control study did not support a causative role for salivirus strains detected in this study with pediatric gastroenteritis. This study also demonstrated that all known saliviruses can be detected in the feces of children with or without gastroenteritis."
CD011926,0,23834440,0,First neonatal case of fungaemia due to Pseudozyma aphidis and a global literature review.,"The Ustilaginomycetous basidiomycete yeast, Pseudozyma aphidis has recently been implicated in potentially fatal disorders ranging from subcutaneous mycoses to disseminated infections. Till date a solitary case of P. aphidis fungaemia in a paediatric patient has been reported. We present a case of fungaemia due to P. aphidis in a rhesus factor-isoimmunised, low-birth-weight neonate. The isolate was identified by sequencing the D1/D2 domain of the LSU region. Antifungal susceptibility of the isolate revealed susceptibility to amphotericin B, voriconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole and posaconazole. It had high minimum inhibitory concentrations of fluconazole and was resistant to flucytosine and echinocandins. Consequently, the patient was successfully treated with intravenous amphotericin B. Although the source of infection could not be traced, as the neonate developed fungaemia on the first day of life, it could possibly be from the maternal urogenital tract or intrahospital transmission. A review of previously published cases revealed that risk factors for invasive Pseudozyma spp. infections were similar to those previously reported for non-albicans Candida spp. Pseudozyma species are underreported due to the difficulty of identifying this rare yeast pathogen by commercial identification systems. Considering that Pseudozyma spp. cause invasive fungal infections globally and are resistant to flucytosine, fluconazole and echinocandins, this pathogen assumes a greater clinical significance."
CD011926,0,9302197,0,Distinct genotypic distributions of cytomegalovirus (CMV) envelope glycoprotein in bone marrow and renal transplant recipients with CMV disease.,"A prospective study of the spectrum of glycoprotein B (gB) and glycoprotein H (gH) genotypes of cytomegalovirus (CMV) was conducted with five categories of patients: viremic bone marrow-transplant (BMT) recipients who developed CMV disease after BMT (n = 22), viremic BMT recipients without CMV disease (n = 11), viremic renal-transplant recipients who developed CMV disease after transplantation (n = 14), viremic renal-transplant recipients without CMV disease (n = 13), and premature babies with asymptomatic congenital CMV infections (n = 13). Genotypic stability was observed because the gB and gH genotypes of multiple isolates obtained from a single patient were identical. The distribution of gH genotypes in patients of all groups studied were similar. However, there was a unique distribution of the gB genotype in the first category of patients, i.e., BMT recipients with CMV disease, which was distinct from those of all other categories (P < 0.05). CMV isolates from 54% of BMT recipients with CMV disease exhibited gB type 2, while isolates from 46, 50, 69, and 77% of the BMT recipients without CMV disease, renal-transplant recipients with and those without CMV disease, and premature babies with congenital CMV infection, respectively, were of gB type 1. An analysis of the clinical characteristics of BMT recipients with CMV disease indicated that all underwent either an allogeneic or matched, unrelated donor transplant, and half had severe acute graft-versus-host disease (grades 2 to 4). The statistically significant genotypic difference between CMV isolates from BMT recipients with and without CMV disease was not observed between isolates from renal-transplant recipients with and without CMV disease. We speculate that differences in pathogenesis in different patient groups might account for these observations. These findings would also facilitate decision making about the choice of recombinant CMV glycoprotein vaccine required to immunize transplant donors and the subsequent adoptive transfer of immunity to BMT recipients. When the source of CMV DNA required for genotyping was investigated among renal-transplant recipients, direct use of peripheral blood leukocytes was 95% effective compared to the effectiveness of cells obtained from conventional culture of peripheral blood specimens."

CD011926,0,22139573,0,History of Parvovirus B19 infection is associated with a DNA methylation signature in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) likely has a multistep etiology, with initial genetic aberrations occurring early in life. An abnormal immune response to common infections has emerged as a plausible candidate for triggering the proliferation of pre-leukemic clones and the fixation of secondary genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations. We investigated whether evidence of infection with a specific common myelotropic childhood virus, parvovirus B19 (PVB19), relates to patterns of gene promoter DNA methylation in ALL patients. We serologically tested bone marrow samples at diagnosis of B-cell ALL for PVB19 infection and DNA methylation using a high-throughput bead array and found that 4.2% and 36.7% of samples were seroreactive to PVB19 IgM and IgG, respectively. Leukemia samples were grouped by DNA methylation pattern. Controlling for age and immunophenotype, unsupervised modeling confirmed that the DNA methylation pattern was associated with history of PVB19 (assessed by IgG, p = 0.02), but not recent infection (assessed by IgM). Replication assays on single genes were consistent with the association. The data indicate that a common viral illness may drive specific DNA methylation patterns in susceptible B-precursor cells, contributing to the leukemogenic potential of such cells. Infections may impact childhood leukemia by altering DNA methylation patterns and specific key genes in susceptible cells; these changes may be retained even after the clearance of infection."

Our aim in this study was to test the polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR) in 86 samples of amniotic fluid from women who seroconverted during pregnancy. DNA was amplified using external primers and, in a second step, internal primers, in a nested PCR system. Samples were also inoculated into mice and the newborn were evaluated by T. gondii serology, skull x-ray, transfontanel ultrasound, fundoscopic examination, lumbar puncture and clinical examination. PCR was positive in seven cases and negative in 79. Among PCR-positive cases, two were negative by inoculation into mice and by clinical evaluation; among PCR-negative ones, three had clinical evidence of toxoplasmosis and one was positive after inoculation into mice. PCR showed values of sensitivity = 62.5% and specificity = 97.4%; the values of inoculation into mice where 42.9% and 100%, respectively. Although PCR should not be used alone for prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis, it is a promising method and deserves more studies to improve its efficacy."
CD011926,0,20220175,0,Revisiting pneumococcal carriage by use of broth enrichment and PCR techniques for enhanced detection of carriage and serotypes.,"The measurement of pneumococcal carriage in the nasopharyngeal reservoir is subject to potential confounders that include low-density and multiple-strain colonization. To compare different methodologies, we picked a random sampling of 100 nasopharyngeal specimens recovered from infants less than 2 years of age who were previously assessed for pneumococcal carriage and serotypes by a conventional method that used direct plating from the transport/storage medium (50 specimens were culture negative and 50 specimens were culture positive for pneumococci). We used a broth enrichment approach and a conventional PCR approach (with and without broth enrichment) to determine pneumococcal carriage and serotypes, and the results were compared to the initial conventional culture-based results. Additionally, we used a lytA-targeted real-time PCR for pneumococcal detection. Broth enrichment for both the culture-based and the PCR-based methods enhanced the isolation of pneumococci and detection of serotype diversity, with the most effective serotype deduction method being one that used broth enrichment prior to sequential multiplex PCR. Similarly, we also found that broth enrichment followed by the lytA-specific real-time PCR was the most sensitive for the detection of apparent pneumococcal carriage. The broth enrichment, conventional multiplex PCR, and real-time PCR approaches used in this study were effective in detecting pneumococcal carriage in the 50 specimens that were negative by conventional direct plating from transport medium (range of numbers of positive specimens, 8/50 to 22/50 [16 to 44%]), and the three different serotyping approaches that used broth enrichment increased the number of serotype identifications from the 100 specimens (12 to 29 additional serotype identifications to be positive). A PCR-based approach that employed a broth enrichment step appeared to best enhance the detection of mixed serotypes and low-density pneumococcal carriage."

During the 2012-2014 rotavirus seasons, children presenting to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children Emergency Department with gastroenteritis symptoms had stool virology analysis (real-time PCR) and clinical outcome recorded. Nosocomial cases were identified as patients with non-gastroenteritis diagnosis testing positive for rotavirus > 48h after admission. In comparison to average pre-vaccine seasons, in the first year after vaccine introduction there were 48% fewer attendances diagnosed with gastroenteritis, 53% reduction in gastroenteritis admissions and a total saving of 330 bed-days occupancy. There was an overall reduction in number of rotavirus-positive stool samples with 94% reduction in children aged under one year and a 65% reduction in those too old to have been vaccinated. In the first year after the introduction of universal vaccination against rotavirus we observed a profound reduction in gastroenteritis presentations and admissions with a substantial possible herd effect seen in older children. Extrapolating these findings to the UK population we estimate secondary healthcare savings in the first year of ca £7.5 (€10.5) million. Ongoing surveillance will be required to determine the long-term impact of the RV immunisation programme."

We examined 658 nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 637 children with respiratory infections for hMPV by using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). A total of 268 samples from 637 children were inoculated onto tertiary monkey kidney cells. A total of 36 serum samples (26 in the acute phase and 10 in the convalescent phase) from the 26 hMPV-positive children were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to hMPV by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. We detected hMPV in 57 (8.9%) of the 637 samples by using RT-PCR and isolated 7 (2.6%) hMPV strains of the 268 samples in cell cultures. A total of 12 (46.2%) of 26 hMPV-positive children were suspected to have primary infection with hMPV as determined by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The infected children were diagnosed as having wheezy bronchitis (36.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (26.3%), bronchitis (22.8%), and pneumonia (14.0%). We showed that two hMPV groups were circulating in different regions during the same period and that reinfection with hMPV frequently occurs in childhood. The RT-PCR test is the most sensitive test for detection of hMPV, and a serological test may be useful to differentiate between primary infection and reinfection with hMPV."

CD011926,0,23769826,0,"Polymorphisms in IL-1 gene cluster and its association with the risk of perinatal HIV transmission, in an Indian cohort.","Host genetic diversity plays a very important role in protecting infants exposed to HIV-1 through their mothers. IL-1 family genes are key mediators of inflammatory responses and no studies are available on its association with perinatal HIV transmission. We aimed to evaluate if single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL-1 family genes are associated with perinatal HIV transmission. Infants of HIV positive women were genotyped for five polymorphic loci in IL1 gene cluster namely; IL1R1 (rs2234650), IL1A (rs1800587), IL1B (rs16944), IL1B (rs1143634), and IL1RN (rs315952) using polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) method. Haplotype block structure was determined using Haploview and statistical analysis was done using PyPop. In this cohort based observational study significantly increased frequency of CT genotype in IL1R1 (rs2234650) was observed in positive vs. negative children (76.4% vs. 42.2%, p = 0.023), while CC genotype was significantly (p = 0.022) high in exposed uninfected children compared to infected ones (51.1% vs. 17.6%). These significances, however, did not stand the Bonferroni corrections. Haplotypic analysis demonstrated that the TCCCT haplotype was significantly associated (p = 0.002) with HIV transmission and remained significant even after Bonferroni correction. The children who had the protective CC genotype at IL1R1 (rs2234650) and were still positive had the TTC haplotype for IL1A (rs1800587):IL1B (rs1143634):IL1R1 (rs2234650). In contrast, 16 out of 19 (84.2%) children who had the CT genotype and were still negative had the protective CTC haplotype for IL1A (rs1800587):IL1B (rs16944):IL1B (rs1143634). IL1R1 (rs2234650) polymorphisms CT/CC along the specific haplotypes of the IL-1 gene family can be exploited as possible markers for prediction of perinatal HIV transmission."

CD011926,0,24242161,0,Enhanced enteric virus detection in sporadic gastroenteritis using a multi-target real-time PCR panel: a one-year study.,"Viral gastroenteritis causes significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. Identifying the etiology of viral gastroenteritis is a challenge as most enteric viruses (EVs) are non-culturable. This study is to develop an EV testing panel using real-time PCR (EVPrtPCR) to simultaneously detect rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, and enteric adenovirus in stool samples. EVPrtPCR using universal amplification conditions was run in a single instrument run. EVPrtPCR was used to test 2,486 sporadic gastroenteritis samples submitted for EV testing using electron microscopy (EM) between July 2008 and July 2009. Retesting spiked negative stool samples and Salmon DNA as internal control were used to evaluate inhibition. EVPrtPCR detected viruses in significantly more samples: 748 (34%) as compared to 94 (3.8%) by EM. EM did not detect any norovirus, sapovirus, and mixed infection, and detected only 39% of rotavirus and 38.2% of enteric adenovirus positive samples. Four samples that tested positive for rotavirus and two for adenovirus and for small-round-structured viruses by EM were negative by EVPrtPCR. Norovirus was the most common virus detected (17.6%) with 92.4% as genogroup II, followed by rotavirus (6.8%), sapovirus (4.2%), astrovirus (2.0%), and enteric adenovirus (1.4%) with 9% samples positive for mixed infection. Overall, EV identification followed a U-shaped age distribution; positive samples were more common in children ≤5 years old and adults >60 years old. Norovirus, sapovirus and astrovirus showed winter predominance and rotavirus peaked in the spring. No inhibition was observed. Molecular technology significantly enhanced the identification of EV causing sporadic gastroenteritis in Alberta."

We investigated capsular serotype as well as methicillin susceptibility, presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), and clonal relatedness of pediatric S. aureus isolates. Clinical isolates were tested for methicillin susceptibility, presence of mecA, lukS-PV and lukF-PV, cap5 and cap8 genes by PCR, and for capsular or surface polysaccharide expression (CP5, CP8, or 336 polysaccharide) by agglutination. Genetic relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All S. aureus isolates encoded cap5 or cap8. Sixty-nine percent of 2004-2005 isolates were methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and most expressed a detectable capsule. The majority of MRSA isolates (82%) were unencapsulated, exposing an expressed cell wall techoic acid antigen 336. Pulsed-field type USA300 were MRSA, PVL-positive, unencapsulated strains that were associated with deep skin infections and recurrent disease. Over half (58%) of all isolates from invasive pediatric dermatologic infections were USA300. All pediatric isolates contained either capsule type 5 or capsule type 8 genes, and roughly half of the S. aureus clinical disease isolates from our population were diverse MSSA-encapsulated strains. The majority of the remaining pediatric clinical disease isolates were unencapsulated serotype 336 strains of the PVL(+) USA300 community-associated-MRSA clone."

By using standard biological assays and DNA-DNA hybridization procedures, ETEC was found in 31.2% of the cases: 14 strains produced heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) only, three strains produced heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and ST, and two strains produced LT only. DNA probes detected all enterotoxin producers except one ST-producing strain. The ST strains hybridized with one or both of the human ST probes (ST Ib and ST A2). Two of the LT-ST strains hybridized with the ST Ia and ST Ib probes, and the third strain did not hybridize with any of the ST probes. Only the ST group expressed multiple resistance (85.7%) and colonization factor antigen I (CFA I) (92.8%); CFA II was found in two of three LT-ST strains. The O153:H45 serotype was found in 10 of 14 ST strains, and O6:K15:H16 was found in one LT strain and in two LT-ST strains. These findings suggest that ETEC, especially strains that produce ST, may be an important cause of diarrhea among Chilean infants."

Association with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature newborns.,"Infants with Ureaplasma urealyticum in the lower respiratory tract are at risk for chronic lung disease (CLD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) but causality has been difficult to prove. The goal of this study was to identify ureaplasma in human neonatal lung tissue using the in situ hybridization (ISH) procedure described in Part 1 (Exp. Mol. Pathol., in press) of this report. By correlating their presence with the histopathologic findings, it may be possible to provide further evidence of the pathogenicity of ureaplasmas and their association with BPD. Lung autopsy tissue from seven infants with positive cultures and seven infants with negative cultures for ureaplasma were included in the study. All culture-positive infants were positive for ureaplasma on ISH and all had histopathologic evidence of BPD. Two of the seven infants with negative cultures were positive for ureaplasma with ISH. Of interest, these two infants were also found to have BPD at autopsy. The other five infants with negative cultures were also negative for ureaplasma on ISH and had no evidence of BPD. This study correlates the presence of U. urealyticum by ISH with the finding of BPD on histopathologic evaluation and provides evidence that it has a role in the development of CLD."

Novel assays for the molecular detection of the organism by real-time quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) targeting the uracil DNA glycosylase gene (udg) or the 23S rRNA gene are described here. The analytical sensitivities are similar to the existing conventional M. amphoriforme 16S rRNA gene PCR, with the advantage of being species specific, rapid, and quantitative. By using these techniques, we demonstrate the presence of this organism in 17 (19.3%) primary antibody-deficient (PAD) patients, 4 (5%) adults with lower respiratory tract infection, 1 (2.6%) sputum sample from a patient attending a chest clinic, and 23 (0.21%) samples submitted for viral diagnosis of respiratory infection, but not in normal adult control subjects.

Four regions within the HIV-1 genome were studied by means of SSCP analysis with the aim of determining which regions were the most informative for the study of HIV-1 transmission or for detection of changes in HIV-1 quasispecies populations. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify V1, V2, V3 of the env gene, and the p2 region in the gag gene. In total, 114 plasma specimens from 79 individuals were tested, including serial specimens from 10 mother-infant pairs that were provided by the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS). HIV-1 in specimens that were PCR-positive with primer pair SK38/SK39 showed different percentages of positive signals with primer pairs for the four regions: V1, 63%; V2, 83%; V3, 88%, and p2, 100%. HIV-1 sequences in the p2 target region displayed the greatest degree of polymorphism. Analysis of serial specimens showed that the V1 target region was the most variable of the four regions studied and was the most appropriate region for monitoring changes in quasispecies populations. Of the four regions studied, p2 was the most informative for the study of HIV transmission, as shown by analysis of samples from documented cases of mother to infant HIV-1 transmission."

A new vaccine has been recently licensed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the epidemiology of MenB disease in pediatric age and define the optimal age for vaccination. All patients aged 0-18 years admitted with a diagnosis of meningitis or sepsis to the 83 participating Italian pediatric hospitals were included in the study. Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were tested by Realtime-PCR and/or culture. One hundred and thirty-six cases (mean age 5.0 years, median 2.7) of MenB disease were found. Among these, 96/136 (70.6%) were between 0 and 5 years, 61/136 (44.9%) were between 0 and 2 years. Among the latter, 39/61 (63.9%) occurred during the first year of life with highest incidence between 4 and 8 months. A case-fatality rate of 13.2% was found, with 27.8% cases below 12 months. Sepsis lethality was 24.4%. RT-PCR was significantly more sensitive than culture: 82 patients were tested at the same time by both methods, either in blood or in CSF; MenB was found by RT-PCR in blood or CSF in 81/82 cases (98.8%), culture identified 27/82 (32.9%) infections (Cohen's Kappa 0.3; McNemar's: p<10⁻⁵). The study shows that the highest incidence of disease occurs in the first year of age, with a peak between 4 and 8 months of life; 30% of deaths occur before 12 months. The results suggest that the greatest prevention could be obtained starting MenB vaccination in the first months of life; a catch-up strategy up to the fifth year of life could be considered. Our results also confirm that Realtime PCR is significantly more sensitive than culture. In those countries where only isolate positive infections are counted as cases, the incidence of MenB infection results highly underestimated."
CD011926,0,16488187,0,Parvovirus B19 infection in pregnancy.,"Parvovirus B19 is a small single-stranded DNA virus and a potent inhibitor of erythropoiesis, due to its cytotoxicity to erythroid progenitor cells. Infection with parvovirus B19 during pregnancy can cause several serious complications in the fetus, such as fetal anemia, neurological anomalies, hydrops fetalis, and fetal death. Early diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine parvovirus B19 infection is essential in preventing these fetal complications. Testing maternal serum for IgM antibodies against parvovirus B19 and DNA detection by PCR can confirm maternal infection. If maternal infection has occurred, ultrasound investigation of the fetus and measurement of the peak systolic flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery are sensitive non-invasive procedures to diagnose fetal anemia and hydrops. Intrauterine transfusion is currently the only effective treatment to alleviate fetal anemia, but if the fetus is (near) term, induction of delivery should be considered. Most maternal infections with parvovirus B19 occur through contact with infected children at home. Individual counseling of susceptible pregnant women will reduce unnecessary fetal deaths."

Fifty-four children were persistently HCV RNA positive, 44 were occasionally positive, and 6 never had detectable viremia. At least 90% of the children had evidence of ongoing infection at the latest analysis. Eighteen children became HCV RNA negative at their last assessments, but 40% of these had high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations. Infection was asymptomatic in all but 2 children, who developed hepatomegaly. Mean ALT concentrations decreased substantially after the first 2 years of life; 14 children had persistently normal ALT values. Signs of minimal to moderate inflammation were noted in all 20 patients who underwent liver biopsy. Perinatal HCV infection is usually asymptomatic in the first years of life, but the virus persists in most children, even in the absence of elevated ALT activity."

While TTV is known to be transmitted through blood transfusions and by fecal-oral route, published information on transplasental transmission is controversial. The aims of this study were to detect the frequency of TTV infection among healthy pregnant women and to search whether TTV is transmitted transplasentally during pregnancy. For this purpose, plasma samples collected from 54 women and their newborns were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and viral loads were determined for infected newborns, and their respective mothers. Also, ten mothers whose newborns were tested negative for TTV-DNA were enrolled in viral load tests for comparison. TTV-DNA was detected in 49 (90.7%) of 54 women. Of 49 newborns whose mothers were infected with TTV, only 4 (8.2%) were found positive for TTV-DNA. There was no statistically significant difference in TTV-DNA loads between mothers who transmitted the virus and those who did not (Mann-Whitney U analysis Z=-0.071, P=0.944). As a result, transplasental transmission of TTV is possible but occurs in low frequency and independent of viral load."

Active research is ongoing to better understand the pathogenesis, immunology, and diagnosis of pertussis. For diagnosis, molecular assays (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) for detection of Bordetella pertussis have become more widely available and support improved outbreak detection. In children, pertussis vaccines have been incorporated into routine immunization schedules and deployed for pertussis outbreak control. Lower levels of vaccine coverage are now being observed in communities where vaccine hesitancy is rising. Additionally, recognition that newborn babies are at risk of pertussis in the USA and UK has led to recommendations to immunize pregnant women. Among adolescents and older adults in the USA, Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular pertussis (Tdap) Vaccines are recommended, but substantial individual- and system-level barriers exist that will make achieving national Healthy People 2020 targets for immunization challenging. Current antimicrobial regimens for pertussis are focused on reducing the severity of disease, reducing rates of sequelae, and minimizing transmission of infection to susceptible individuals. Continued surveillance for pertussis will be important to identify opportunities for reducing young infants' exposure and reducing the impact of outbreaks among school-aged children. Laboratory-based surveillance for newly emerging strains of B. pertussis will be important to identify strains that may evade protection elicited by currently available vaccines. Efforts to develop new-generation pertussis vaccines should be considered now in anticipation of vaccine development programs, which may require ten or more years to deliver a licensed vaccine."
CD011926,0,2557458,0,DNA probe technique for diagnosis of human cytomegalovirus infection.,"A rapid diagnostic assay for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been developed for detecting HCMV DNA in urine samples with 32P-labelled cloned fragment, Eco RI fragment B, of DNA from HCMV strain Towne. 3.2 pg of homologous fragment from HCMV DNA could be detected by the labelled probe, and it did not hybridize DNA from other herpes viruses or human cells in dot hybridization assay. The assay correctly identified all (100%) of 7 coded urine specimen cultures positive for HCMV and 9 (90%) of 10 urine sample cultures negative for HCMV. So the hybridization assay was correct and as sensitive as the currently available tissue culture technique. The infection levels of different populations, such as organ transplantation recipients, patients with infantile hepatitis syndrome, normal infants, fetuses, have been investigated by the hybridization assay in the present study."
CD011926,0,8158456,0,Role of respiratory viral infection in SIDS: detection of viral nucleic acid by in situ hybridization.,"There is considerable evidence suggesting that respiratory viral infection is involved in the genesis of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), with rates of about 20 per cent of SIDS victims compared to about 13 per cent of controls. Since the techniques used previously are prone to under-reporting from autopsy material, non-isotopic in situ hybridization (NISH) has been used to detect viral nucleic acid in lung in SIDS. Forty-five SIDS cases (30 males) were examined (age range 3 weeks-14 months, mean age 3.9 months). Thirty non-SIDS cases (15 males) were also examined (age range 5 weeks-24 months, mean age 9.0 months). Eleven of 45 (24.4 per cent) SIDS cases were positive by NISH compared to 1 of 30 (3.3 per cent) non-SIDS cases (P = 0.012). There were eight cases of adenovirus type 5, two cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and one case of parainfluenza virus type 2. The one positive control case was adenovirus type 5. Only lung parenchyma was examined here. Additional examination of the upper respiratory tract may increase the number of positive cases."

We randomly selected 298 neonates who had been admitted to Muhimbili Medical Center (MMC) at Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. One baby among all the enrolled neonates was recognized as having a congenital malaria infection, which gave a prevalence of 0.33%. The present result was 5-fold the clinically recognized prevalence of congenital infection with malaria in the ward. The PCR method identified two cases, one of which was negative as determined by the Giemsa-staining method. Therefore, the PCR method was useful for the detection of scant amounts of malarial parasites in numerous blood samples. The screening of malaria by a sensitive PCR method contributes to reduce the mortality of asymptotic neonates in particular."

CD011926,0,2845316,0,Human parvovirus infection in pregnancy.,"During an outbreak of fifth disease in the Hartford, Connecticut area in the winter of 1986, nine pregnant women were exposed to the parvovirus. Five of these nine had serologic evidence of previous exposure and immunity; all five had uneventful pregnancies. Three of the four women who exhibited serologic evidence of recent exposure to the parvovirus had hydropic fetuses who died, one of whom was anencephalic. Histologic and DNA hybridization studies suggest parvovirus infection as a cause for nonimmune hydrops and fetal death. A review of the literature suggests that of 37 women who were exposed and infected by human B19 parvovirus during pregnancy, 14 (38%) had adverse outcomes, including spontaneous abortions, intrauterine fetal death, and congenital anomalies. Women at high risk for exposure (school teachers) should have screening for immunoglobulin G parvovirus-specific antibodies; if these are absent, they should avoid close contact with schoolchildren. Pregnant women with evidence of recent infection should have a level II ultrasound. Because no vaccine is currently available, routine screening cannot be recommended."
CD011926,0,14638992,0,Rate of Helicobacter pylori infection in children and clonality of Taiwan strains.,"The infection rate of Helicobacter pylori in children from < 1 to 17 years old was investigated. Three techniques, namely culture, CLO test, and PCR, were employed to check the presence or absence of the organism in the antrum of the stomach. Several PCR positives without viable cultures were observed in babies of less than one year old. On the other hand, only two viable cultures were obtained from toddlers of less than two years old. The percentage of positive cultures steadily increased from 8% (3 of 42 cases) in the 0-4 years old age group to 32% (32 of 99 cases) in the 13-17 years old age group. A steady increase also was observed in the result of the CLO test. In PCR, the percentage of positives was greatly higher than that seen with the culture or CLO test. The rate of PCR positives also showed an increase with age but of a much slower rate. The overall infection rate in 295 children was 22% (64 of 295 cases) positive with culture and 76% (225 of 295 cases) with PCR, in contrast to 85% (40 of 49 cases) and 92% (43 of 47 cases), respectively, in adults. The urease activity of the H. pylori derived from children was much lower than that derived from adults (P < 0.001). Taken together, these results suggest that a child might be repeatedly infected and some infecting strains eventually might obtain a steady infection, perhaps by a strain of higher virulence such as higher urease activity. The base variations in the nucleotide sequences did not correlate to the varied urease activities or to the age of the child. The sequences, however, indicated that there were two types of strains. The strains in Taiwan appeared to be derived from the French type strain and not the English type strain. The amino acid sequences of the ureA and the phylogenetic relationship of the 29 strains indicated that the strains in Taiwan are rapidly evolving into a unique clone."

Focal encephalitis is increasingly recognized as a complication of enterovirus infection. Patients at greatest risk for sequelae of CNS enteroviral disease include neonates and those who are immunocompromised. The clinical presentation may mimic that of bacterial or other viral CNS infections, a circumstance making laboratory diagnosis of paramount importance for reducing unnecessary hospitalization and therapy.

To evaluate the usefulness of LAMP for diagnosing central nervous system infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), we compared the LAMP method with real-time PCR, using samples that were previously tested by nested PCR. We examined 69 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients suspected of having HSV infection of the central nervous system. The results of the real-time PCR analysis and nested PCR assay were in complete accord. When nested PCR was regarded as standard, the sensitivity of LAMP was 81%, the specificity was 100%, the positive predictive value was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 90%. Although further improvement is necessary for the wide spread use, the LAMP method might be applicable to diagnosis of HSV infection of the central nervous system."

CD011926,0,17374846,0,Genome-level expression profiles in pediatric septic shock indicate a role for altered zinc homeostasis in poor outcome.,"Human septic shock involves multiple genome-level perturbations. We have conducted microarray analyses in children with septic shock within 24 h of intensive care unit admission, using whole blood-derived RNA. Based on sequential statistical and expression filters, there were 2,482 differentially regulated gene probes (1,081 upregulated and 1,401 downregulated) between patients with septic shock (n = 42) and controls (n = 15). Both gene lists encompassed several biologically relevant gene ontologies and canonical pathways. Notably, many of the genes downregulated in the patients with septic shock, relative to the controls, participate in gene ontologies related to metal or zinc homeostasis. Comparison of septic shock survivors (n = 33) and nonsurvivors (n = 9) demonstrated differential regulation of 63 gene probes. Among the 63 gene probes differentially regulated between septic shock survivors and nonsurvivors, two isoforms of metallothionein (MT) demonstrated increased expression in the nonsurvivors. Consistent with the ability of MT to sequester zinc in the intracellular compartment, nonsurvivors had lower serum zinc levels compared with survivors. In a corroborating study of murine sepsis, MT-null mice demonstrated a survival advantage compared with wild-type mice. These data represent the largest reported cohort of pediatric patients with septic shock that has undergone genome-level expression profiling based on microarray. The data are biologically plausible and demonstrate that genome-level alterations of zinc homeostasis may be prevalent in clinical pediatric septic shock."

The main developments in bronchiolitis management in recent years relate to the use of immunoprophylaxis; a number of other therapies such as the use of heliox are currently being investigated. Supportive therapy remains the mainstay of management with limited or no evidence of benefit for most other pharmacological treatments.

CD011926,0,12093990,0,Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children.,"Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity."

CD011926,0,17919090,0,Maternal HIV-1 DNA load and mother-to-child transmission.,"While many factors contribute to mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1, maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (RNA-VL) has been consistently found as the main risk factor, including when antiretroviral prophylaxis was used to prevent MTCT. However the predictive value of RNA-VL is poor. A recent study of HIV-1-positive pregnant women who did not receive antiretroviral prophylaxis reported an association between HIV-1 DNA viral load (DNA-VL) and MTCT that was stronger than the association between RNA-VL and MTCT. We sought to determine if HIV-1 DNA-VL was independently associated with MTCT of HIV in a population of women who received zidovudine prophylaxis during pregnancy and whose infants received zidovudine after birth. Patients were 33 non-breastfeeding transmitting (TR) and 33 nontransmitting mothers (NTR) from Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial (PHPT-1), a multicenter clinical trial conducted in Thailand comparing zidovudine prophylaxis durations to prevent MTCT. TR and NTR mothers were matched according to baseline RNA-VL. Maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-associated HIV-1 DNA was extracted from whole blood, and DNA-VL was established by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that TR had a significantly higher cell-associated HIV-1 DNA viral load than did NTR. Median TR DNA-VL was 2.54 log(10) copies per microgram PBMC DNA, while it was 2.28 log(10) copies per microgram PBMC DNA in NTR (Wilcoxon p = 0.02). In summary, HIV-1 DNA viral load was associated with MTCT in a population of women who received antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnancy, independently from RNA viral load."

CD011926,0,21074372,0,Orally administered colistin leads to colistin-resistant intestinal flora and fails to prevent faecal colonisation with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteria in hospitalised newborns.,"Colonisation and infection with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) is an emerging problem. The aim of this study was to investigate whether colistin, which is reported to be effective against multiresistant enterobacteria, prevents ESBL-E colonisation in neonates. For prophylaxis of necrotising enterocolitis, oral gentamicin (15 mg/kg/day) is routinely used in all neonates hospitalised at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of University Hospital Graz (Austria). During the study period from May 2005 to September 2007, three ESBL-E outbreaks (total duration 18 months) occurred. During these outbreaks, gentamicin was immediately replaced by oral colistin (8 mg/kg/day) in all hospitalised neonates. All neonates colonised with ESBL-E during the study period were retrospectively analysed with regard to the influence of colistin on ESBL-E colonisation. Genetic relatedness of isolates was assessed by repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR). During the study period, 30 (4.5%) of 667 neonates were colonised with ESBL-E. Twelve of twenty-one patients colonised with Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kp) and one of nine patients colonised with Klebsiella oxytoca (ESBL-Ko) had received oral colistin at time of colonisation with ESBL-E. Amongst ESBL-Kp, the rate of colistin resistance was significantly higher in the colistin group (P=0.0075). Four different clones of ESBL-Kp and three different clones of ESBL-Ko were isolated, indicating the occurrence of patient-to-patient transmission. Colistin-resistant as well as colistin-susceptible isolates were detected within the same clones, indicating induction of resistance. At the dosage used, oral colistin did not prevent colonisation with ESBL-E and appeared to select colistin-resistant strains or to induce colistin resistance."

CD011926,0,22305665,0,[Diagnosis of congenital infection].,"In general, congenital diagnosis is based on: a) maternal serologic assays; b) microbiologic study of amniotic fluid or fetal blood sampling; and c) serology in children and microorganism detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture. Congenital infections due to cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, varicella, B19 erythrovirus and toxoplasmosis are usually the result of primary infection in the mother. Therefore, when IgG antibodies are detected before pregnancy, these infections are ruled out. Definitive serologic diagnosis of acute infection in pregnant women requires the demonstration of seroconversion (i.e., from seronegative to seropositive). In these cases, amniotic fluid or fetal blood sampling should be performed to determine the presence of intrauterine congenital infection. Cytomegalovirus, rubella and toxoplasmosis can be diagnosed by detection of specific IgM antibodies in fetal blood. However, PCR in amniotic fluid has replaced conventional prenatal diagnostic techniques, including fetal blood sampling, in the diagnosis of these infections. In the newborn, these infections may be confirmed by measuring IgM specific antibodies. B19 erythrovirus can be detected by PCR in amniotic fluid or fetal blood. Congenital varicella-zoster infection may be diagnosed on the basis of persistence of IgG antibodies after birth. Definitive diagnosis of herpes simplex virus infection requires viral isolation. Swabs or scraping from clinical specimens can be inoculated into susceptible cell lines for isolation."

In this study, we investigated the diversity of rotavirus strains circulating among young children <5years of age, presenting with gastroenteritis disease either at the general practitioner or in the hospital, during the period 2009-2013. A total of 831 rotavirus positive stool samples were genotyped in the study period, and the majority of samples (74%) were from hospitalized children. G and P genotypes were successfully determined for 826 of samples, with G1P[8] being the most commonly detected genotype. Detection of G1 showed a decreasing trend over time, and an inverse trend was seen for the emerging G9P. The common human genotypes (G1/G3/G4/G9P[8] and G2P[4]) were detected in the majority of samples (n=733, 88.2%). Rare genotype combinations such as G6P[14] were detected in <1% of samples. Rare genotype strains and strains which failed to amplify in genotyping RT-PCR were subjected to genetic characterization by sequencing one or all of the following genes; VP7, VP4, VP6 and NSP4. Sequences of sufficient length and quality were available for all 4 genes for 28 strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that reassortant G9P[4] strains circulated with 3 different genotype combinations. As rotavirus vaccines are not widely used in Denmark or its neighboring countries, the diversity of rotavirus strains identified in this study most likely reflects naturally occurring selection pressures and viral evolution."

A rapid and simple DNA extraction procedure from DBS was developed and evaluated for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in children by an in-house nested-PCR assay on three genome regions and by the Amplicor HIV-1 DNA prototype assay version 1.5 (Roche Molecular Systems). A total of 150 samples from children born to HIV-1-infected mothers were collected in Kigali, Rwanda, in parallel as DBS and as peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) pellets. The results obtained on DBS by the two PCR assays were compared to the results of nested PCR on PBMCs. Of 150 PBMC samples, 10 were positive, 117 were negative, and 23 were indeterminate for HIV-1 infection. In DNA extracted from filter papers and amplified by using the in-house nested PCR, 9 of these 10 positive samples (90%) were found to be positive, and 1 was found to be indeterminate (only the pol region could be amplified). All of the negative samples and all of the 23 indeterminate samples tested negative for HIV-1 infection. When we used the Amplicor DNA test on DBS, all of the 10 PBMC-positive samples were found to be positive and all of the 23 indeterminate samples were found to be negative. Of the PBMC-negative samples, 115 were found to be negative and 2 were found to be indeterminate. We conclude that this simple rapid DNA extraction method on DBS in combination with both detection methods gave a reliable molecular diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in children born to HIV-infected mothers."

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was compared with EIA detection of astrovirus in stool specimens to characterize further the molecular epidemiology of an outbreak of astrovirus-associated gastroenteritis. Three hundred sixty-eight stool specimens collected prospectively from 36 children enrolled in a DCC during an 11-week outbreak of diarrhea were evaluated by EIA and RT-PCR. Astrovirus was detected in 32% of specimens by RT-PCR versus 10% by EIA (P < .001) and in 89% of children by RT-PCR versus 50% by EIA. The median duration of astrovirus excretion episodes detected by EIA was 1.5 days versus 4 days by RT-PCR (P = .06). Astrovirus was excreted for prolonged periods by immunocompetent children during this outbreak. RT-PCR was more sensitive than EIA for detection of astrovirus in stool specimens and redefined the epidemiology of astrovirus infection in this setting.

Postconceptional ages ranged between 15 and 21 weeks. 3 preterm infants born to HIV positive mothers whose survival ranged from 6 hours to 6 months were included in the study. In all cases, the development of the CNS was macroscopically normal. The microscopic examination showed many ectopic neurons indicating disturbances of normal neuronal migration. As a regular finding there was a significant increase in microglia in all areas of the CNS but no microglial nodules were found. In all cases haematogenous monocytes were scattered in the perivascular space of the cerebral parenchyma as well as in the chorioid pexus. The virus-antigen p24 could neither be detected immunohistochemically in the paraffin sections nor in the frozen material of the brain or by in-situ-hybridization. In contrast, in five of the cases investigated the placenta showed macrophages, socalled Hofbauer cells with p24-associated antigen."

CD011926,0,7475311,0,Long-term expression of the glucocerebrosidase gene in mouse and human hematopoietic progenitors.,"Gaucher disease (GD), one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders, is an excellent candidate for gene therapy using hematopoietic stem cells as targets. Animal models have demonstrated the feasibility of introducing the human glucocerebrosidase (GC) gene into hematopoietic progenitors with long term expression using a variety of retroviral vectors. We have previously demonstrated the expression and integration of the human GC gene in mouse hematopoietic progenitors and their progeny 4-8 months post transplant in primary recipients using the retroviral vector MFG-GC. We now demonstrate enzyme expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of secondary recipients more than 12 months post transplantation. We also show a transduction efficiency of up to 95% in colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies generated from transduced CD34+ cells from a variety of sources, using a centrifugation promoted infection protocol. Transduction has also been documented in long term culture initiating cells (LTCIC) from the same transduced CD34+ cells. These data indicate efficient transduction of mouse hematopoietic progenitors as well as human CD34+ cells using the retroviral vector MFG-GC."
CD011926,0,15531836,0,Management of neonatal herpes simplex virus infections.,"As many as 2,500 infants develop neonatal herpes each year, most of whom are born to women with no history or physical findings suggestive of genital herpes. Infection usually takes one of three forms: 1) disease localized to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes, 2) localized central nervous system infection, or 3) disseminated infection. Exposure to the virus occurs during passage through an infected birth canal, but 5% of infants acquire the infection in utero. The mortality rate is 31% for disseminated infection and 6% for localized central nervous system disease; long-term neurologic sequelae are seen in 17% and 70% of survivors, respectively. Diagnosis is made by isolating of the virus from skin lesions or other involved sites. The polymerase chain reaction for the detection of viral DNA in cerebrospinal fluid or serum is now the diagnostic test of choice for central nervous system or disseminated neonatal herpes because it has higher sensitivity than traditional culture methods. Treatment is with high-dose intravenous acyclovir (60 mg/kg per day in three divided doses), with adjustments made for infants with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Supportive measures and neuroimaging studies are often required. Acyclovir is administered for three weeks, but infants with disease localized to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes can be treated for two weeks if the cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction assay is negative for herpes simplex virus DNA. Prevention of infection in infants can be accomplished by cesarean delivery when women have active lesions at the onset of labor. Neonates delivered through an infected birth canal should be screened between 24 and 48 hours of age with viral cultures of eyes, nasopharynx, mouth, and rectum. If positive, they should be treated with acyclovir even if asymptomatic. Suppressive acyclovir therapy beginning at 36 weeks gestation is often prescribed for women with frequent recurrences of genital herpes."
CD011926,0,10555197,0,"Diagnostic value of viral culture, polymerase chain reaction and western blot for HIV-1 infection in 218 infants born to HIV-infected mothers and examined at different ages.","In a prospective longitudinal 10-year (1988 to 1998) study, 308 sequential blood samples from 218 infants born to HIV-1 seropositive women were examined by blood culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western Blot (WB) for HIV-1 infection within the first month of life (no. 47 specimens), at 2-6 (no. 125), 7-18 (no. 80), and > 18 (no. 56) months after birth. Clinical status at follow-up after the initial diagnosis of HIV infection was also evaluated. Vertically transmitted HIV infection was diagnosed in 45 children (24 children were diagnosed before 18 months of age), whereas 173 were found to be uninfected (transmission rate 20.6%). Sensitivities of viral culture, PCR and WB were 95.2%, 97.8%, 94.4%, and specificities were 99.5%, 97.6% and 20.7%, respectively. Thus, cumulative positive predictive values (PPV) of blood culture, PCR and WB were 97.5%, 88.2% and 23.4%, while negative predictive values (NPV) were 99.0%, 99.6% and 100.0%, respectively. In view of defining the optimal time of sampling for a correct diagnosis of HIV infection, a PPV of 100.0% was achieved earlier by viral culture (2-6 months of age) than by PCR (7-18 months of age). Meanwhile, a NPV of 100% was obtained earlier by PCR (within the first month of age) than by viral culture (2-6 months). These results indicate that a combination test strategy requiring two blood samples analyzed by viral culture and PCR may confirm or exclude HIV perinatal infection within the first 2 months of life rather than being delayed to later times. Clinical follow-up was performed in 35 children, of whom 7 developed a rapidly progressive disease, 23 showed a slow progression, while 5 children are still younger than 5 years and do not present severe clinical symptoms."

However, no evidence of clinical illness correlated with the primary infection has been found in immunocompetent children. We analyzed 458 nasopharyngeal aspirates from 422 patients hospitalized with 431 episodes of acute respiratory tract infection (RTI) by using a real-time PCR assay. In 68 episodes in 67 infants, P. jirovecii was identified. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of a positive signal compared with the first quartile of age (7-49 days) was 47.4 (11.0-203), 8.7 (1.9-39.7), and 0.6 (0.1-6.7) for infants in the second (50-112 days), third (113-265 days), and fourth (268-4,430 days) age quartiles, respectively. Infants with an episode of upper RTI (URTI) were 2.0 (1.05-3.82) times more likely to harbor P. jirovecii than infants with a lower RTI. P. jirovecii may manifest itself as a self-limiting URTI in infants, predominantly those 1.5-4 months of age."

CD011926,0,20884156,0,Evaluation of the efficacy of real-time polymerase chain reaction for the routine early detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis sputum and throat swab specimens.,"A longitudinal study of 2099 sputa and throat swabs received from 183 pediatric cystic fibrosis patients over a 29-month period was used to evaluate the efficacy of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the early detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as compared to microbiologic culture. Real-time PCR resulted in an increased number of specimens identified as P. aeruginosa positive. The sensitivity of culture was 82% (373/453) and of PCR was 93% (420/453) when considering both positive culture and PCR results as true positives. Of the 80 specimens identified as PCR positive/culture negative for P. aeruginosa, the subsequent patient sample in 32.5% (26/80) of specimens concerned was identified as P. aeruginosa culture positive, suggesting that PCR has the potential to detect P. aeruginosa earlier than the microbiologic culture. Real-time PCR analysis found no evidence of the Liverpool and Manchester epidemic P. aeruginosa strains in the cohort examined. The findings of this study highlight the importance of specimen collection protocols to ensure that adequate samples are received at the laboratory for testing, thereby minimizing the potential for reporting of false-negative P. aeruginosa culture results."

CD011926,0,23912873,0,Herpes Simplex Virus 1 infection: misleading findings in an infant with disseminated disease.,"Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection is a serious illness with significant mortality and morbidity for disseminated disease. Clinical diagnosis of neonatal HSV infection is often difficult without evidence of HSV exposure, for example, absence of a rash or the presence of non-specified manifestations in an infant. Early recognition and treatment with high-dose Acyclovir may dramatically improve the short and long-term outcomes. We describe an infant with disseminated disease due to HSV-1 infection, who first presented clinical and radiologic features of pneumonia. The diagnosis was performed post-mortem by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis of blood, cerebrospinal fluid and pleural liquid of the infant. Tissue PCR revealed a disseminated HSV-1 infection, with a high viral load detected in liver, lungs, brain, heart, striated muscle, kidneys, and thymus tissues. This case report highlights the need for neonatologists to raise awareness about the different clinical manifestations of disseminated neonatal HSV infection. HSV infections should be prominent in the differential diagnosis of an infant under four weeks of age with fever, pneumonia, unexplained seizures or sepsis-like disease, particularly if unresponsive to antibiotics. Early initiation of appropriate antiviral therapy for high-risk infants undergoing testing for HSV infection can be essential to prevent significant morbidity and mortality."

One strain, isolated from the throat of a child in Maryland during an upper respiratory illness in 1968, was partially neutralized by Ad 31 antisera (to 16-fold lower than homologous titer) while its own antiserum fully neutralized prototype Ad 31 virus, but shared only 9% of comigrating RE fragments with Ad 31 prototype (vs. 30% with Ad 18 prototype); however, PCR tests specific for the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequence of Ads 12 and 18 were negative. The other strain, recovered from a stool sample from an infant with diarrhea in Georgia in 1979, was inhibited by Ad 31 antiserum to within 4-fold homologous titer, but shared only 15% of comigrating fragments with Ad 31 prototype (vs. 91% with Ad 18 prototype); ITR-specific PCR tests with this virus were positive for Ad 12/Ad 18. These data suggest that both strains are from separate evolutionary lines of Ad 31 unrelated to all other isolates studied to date by RE analysis, and that the partial neutralization by prototype Ad 31 antisera might represent small mutations in the hexon gene."

During the period from March 2011 to January 2012, a total of 450 stool samples of diarrheal children aged 0-60 months were studied. In order to detect enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) simultaneously, a mixture of four primer pairs specific for eltB, estA, vt1, and vt2 genes was used in a multiplex PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. A total of 140 (31·1%) DEC were isolated from 450 stool samples. Diarrheagenic E. coli exhibited high-level resistance to aztreonam (80·7%), amoxicillin (74·4%), and tetracycline (69·3%). Also, 86·4% of E. coli isolates were resistant to at least three different classes of antimicrobial agents and considered as MDR. The frequency of ETEC and EHEC pathotypes was 46·4 and 12·1%, respectively and all of these isolates were MDR. In conclusion, MDR ETEC continues to be an important agent associated with diarrhea in children from Tabriz, Iran."

Of 290 patients with a mean age of 3.7 years, only 3 (1%) were identified to be infected with C. pneumoniae. One child was positive in the cell culture as well as the PCR assay. Another infant was PCR-positive only and serologic evidence of infection was observed in a culture- and PCR-negative child.

Clinical evaluation of 109 gastroenteritis patients with confirmed diagnosis was graded by the Ruska-Vesikari scoring system, showing vomiting (78%), diarrhea (96%) and fever (80%). A total of 25 NoV-positive samples were selected for nucleotide sequence analysis. The severity of AdV-associated infection was lower than for NoV, HRV and HBoV. These latter viruses caused similar symptoms that were indistinguishable using clinical information. NoV, HRV and HBoV were often present as mixed infections (13.1%).

RSV typing into subgroup A and B was obtained by RT-PCR-hybridization assay. The nasopharyngeal RSV viral loads were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Disease severity correlated significantly with the presence of risk factor (estimated gestational age < 37 weeks and/or birth weight < 2,500 g) and with chronologic age <or= 28 days at time of sample collection. The results revealed significant association between disease severity and nasopharyngeal RSV viral load. Analysis also showed that disease severity was not associated significantly with RSV subgroup. Thus, RSV disease severity is likely to be determined by an interplay between host and virus factors, including RSV load."

Primers and probes, designed to target highly conserved regions of the matrix protein of influenza A and the nucleoprotein of influenza B, were optimized using the high-throughput LightCycler 480 II system. Analytical sensitivity and specificity were characterized using RNA transcripts diluted serially, archived non-influenza respiratory viruses, and proficiency test samples. Eighty-nine clinical samples were tested in parallel against existing influenza A and B monoplex assays. Once validated, the duplex assay was applied prospectively on 2,458 clinical specimens that were later subtyped. In April 2011, the emergence of an influenza B variant necessitated the inclusion of an additional modified probe for influenza B and revalidation of the revised protocol. The lower detection limits of the assay were 50 copies/PCR. There was no cross-reactivity against any non-influenza respiratory virus and all proficiency testing materials were identified correctly. The parallel testing revealed a 98.9% overall agreement. Routine application of the assay revealed high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of influenza A/H1N1/2009, A/H3N2 and influenza B. Assay C(q) values correlated well between the pre- and post-revision protocols for influenza A (r(2) = 0.998) and B (r(2) = 0.999). The revised protocol detected three additional novel influenza B variant cases in 200 specimens reported previously as influenza B negative. This in-house assay offers a highly sensitive and specific option for laboratories seeking to expand their influenza testing capacity."

We detected serum GBV-C/HGV RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 1 (3%) of 38 cholestatic infants, in 4 (4%) of 95 children without liver disease, and in none of 30 children with autoimmune hepatitis. One cholestatic infant had antibodies, presumably maternal, to GBV-C/HGV. Sequence analysis of a nonstructural 3 region fragment suggested that mother-to-infant transmission was the route of infection for the cholestatic infant. The four infected children without liver disease had normal liver function test results and lacked risk factors for bloodborne infections. Thus, the detection of GBV-C/HGV RNA among children with and without liver disease suggests that chronic GBV-C/ HGV infections may be established early in life, possibly by mother-to-infant transmission. This may explain in part the high prevalence of serum GBV-C/HGV RNA and antibodies in healthy adults."

CD011926,0,22447597,0,Genetic analysis of the Cronobacter sakazakii O4 to O7 O-antigen gene clusters and development of a PCR assay for identification of all C. sakazakii O serotypes.,"The Gram-negative bacterium Cronobacter sakazakii is an emerging food-borne pathogen that causes severe invasive infections in neonates. Variation in the O-antigen lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane provides the basis for Gram-negative bacteria serotyping. The O-antigen serotyping scheme for C. sakazakii, which includes seven serotypes (O1 to O7), has been recently established, and the O-antigen gene clusters and specific primers for three C. sakazakii serotypes (O1, O2, and O3) have been characterized. In this study, the C. sakazakii O4, O5, O6, and O7 O-antigen gene clusters were sequenced, and gene functions were predicted on the basis of homology. C. sakazakii O4 shared a similar O-antigen gene cluster with Escherichia coli O103. The general features and anomalies of all seven C. sakazakii O-antigen gene clusters were evaluated and the relationship between O-antigen structures and their gene clusters were investigated. Serotype-specific genes for O4 to O7 were identified, and a molecular serotyping method for all C. sakazakii O serotypes, a multiplex PCR assay, was developed by screening against 136 strains of C. sakazakii and closely related species. The sensitivity of PCR-based serotyping method was determined to be 0.01 ng of genomic DNA and 10(3) CFU of each strain/ml. This study completes the elucidation of C. sakazakii O-antigen genetics and provides a molecular method suitable for the identification of C. sakazakii O1 to O7 strains."

CD011926,0,9219185,0,Representation and analysis of medical decision problems with influence diagrams.,"Influence diagrams are a powerful graphic representation for decision models, complementary to decision trees. Influence diagrams and decision trees are different graphic representations for the same underlying mathematical model and operations. This article describes the elements of an influence diagram, and shows several familiar decision problems represented as decision trees and as influence diagrams. The authors also contrast the information highlighted in each graphic representation, demonstrate how to calculate the expected utilities of decision alternatives modeled with an influence diagram, provide an overview of the conceptual basis of the solution algorithms that have been developed for influence diagrams, discuss the strengths and limitations of influence diagrams relative to decision trees, and describe the mathematical operations that are used to evaluate both decision trees and influence diagrams. They use clinical examples to illustrate the mathematical operations of the influence-diagram-evaluation algorithm; these operations are arc reversal, chance node removal by averaging, and decision node removal by policy determination. Influence diagrams may be helpful when problems have a high degree of conditional independence, when large models are needed, when communication of the probabilistic relationships is important, or when the analysis requires extensive Bayesian updating. The choice of graphic representation should be governed by convenience, and will depend on the problem being analyzed, on the experience of the analyst, and on the background of the consumers of the analysis."
CD011926,0,11325976,0,Evaluation of the Hexaplex assay for detection of respiratory viruses in children.,"The Hexaplex assay (Prodesse, Inc., Milwaukee, Wis.) is a multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assay for the detection of parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B, and influenza virus types A and B. We evaluated the Hexaplex assay in comparison with conventional viral cell cultures and rapid enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for RSV (Directigen; Becton Dickinson Inc., Cockeysville, Md.) and influenza A virus (Abbott Test Pack; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill.) for the detection of respiratory viruses from pediatric respiratory specimens obtained from children seen at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin from December 1997 through May 1998. A total of 363 respiratory specimens were evaluated. The tissue culture prevalence of parainfluenza virus during this period of time was low (1.1%). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of Hexaplex compared to tissue culture for the detection of parainfluenza virus were 100, 95.8, 19.0, and 100%, respectively. Only one specimen was determined to contain influenza B virus by Hexaplex; it was tissue culture negative. A specimen was considered to contain RSV or influenza A virus when it was either culture positive or culture negative but Hexaplex and EIA positive. Prior to the analysis of discrepant results, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for the detection of RSV were 91.2, 100, 100, and 98.0%, respectively, for tissue culture; 84.5, 100, 100, and 96.6% for EIA; and 98.5, 91.5, 72.8, and 99.6% for Hexaplex, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for the detection of influenza A virus prior to the analysis of discrepant results were 100, 100, 100, and 100%, respectively, for culture, 78.0, 100, 100, and 89.4% for EIA, respectively, and 95.1, 94.1, 67.2, and 99.3% for Hexaplex, respectively. Culture- and/or EIA-negative, Hexaplex-positive specimens were analyzed by a second RT-PCR assay which used primers specific for a different genomic region than that used in the Hexaplex assay. After analysis of these discrepant results, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for the detection of RSV were 74.3, 100, 100, and 93.5%, respectively, for tissue culture; 70.3, 100, 100, and 92.5% for EIA; and 98.6, 97.4, 91.2, and 99.6% for Hexaplex. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for the detection of influenza A virus were 83.3, 100, 100, and 97.4%, respectively, for tissue culture; 69.4, 100, 100, and 83.3% for EIA; and 95.8, 98.7, 92.0, and 99.3% for Hexaplex. Hexaplex is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for the detection of the seven most common respiratory viruses in children."

CD011926,0,17567789,0,Sensitive oligonucleotide ligation assay for low-level detection of nevirapine resistance mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 quasispecies.,"This study has adapted the oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) to probe for low-level nevirapine (NVP) resistance mutations K103N and Y181C in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) population of infected mother-infant pairs from Uganda. When NVP is used to prevent perinatal transmission, NVP-resistant HIV-1 clones may be rapidly selected due to a low barrier for mutation and a relatively high level of fitness (compared to that of other drug-resistant HIV-1 clones). Monitoring for even a low frequency of NVP resistance mutations may help predict the success of subsequent treatment or warrant the use of another regimen to prevent transmission in a subsequent pregnancy. The standard OLA was optimized by using nonstandard bases in oligonucleotides to allow promiscuous base pairing and accommodate significant HIV-1 heterogeneity. Radiolabeled as opposed to fluorescently tagged oligonucleotides increased the sensitivity, whereas alteration of the template, oligonucleotides, salt, and thermostable DNA ligase concentrations increased the specificity for the detection of minority codons. This modified OLA is now capable of detecting mutants with the K103N or the Y181C mutation present in an HIV-1 population at a frequency of approximately 0.4% and is at least 10- to 30-fold more sensitive than the original protocol. A cohort of 19 Ugandan mothers who received NVP treatment perinatally were sampled 6 weeks postdelivery. Ten of 19 HIV-1 DNA samples extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells had a detectable K103N (0.5 to 44%) or Y181C (0.8 to 92.5%) mutation, but only one plasma HIV-1 RNA sample had a viral population with the Y181C mutation. These findings suggest that OLA is a robust, sensitive, and specific method for the detection of low-frequency drug resistance mutations in an intrapatient HIV-1 population."

In this study, a total of 434 fecal samples collected from 434 children with acute gastroenteritis in Seoul, between September 2007 and July 2008 were tested to determine the molecular epidemiology of NoVs and characterize recombinant strains by using RT-PCR followed by sequencing. Of the 434 specimens, NoV, rotavirus, and adenovirus were detected in 155 (35.8%), 72 (16.6%), and 19 specimens (4.3%), respectively. NoV GI was detected in 7 specimens (1.6%) and GII in 148 (34.1%) specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of capsid sequences in the GII-positive specimens revealed the presence of the following strains: GII-4, 111 (75.0%); GII-3, 35 cases (23.6%); GII-6b, 1 case; and GII-16, 1 case. Most of the GII-4 strains were grouped with the GII-4/2006b variant with 98-100% nucleotide identity. Eleven strains were identified as recombinant (GII-4/GII-3 in 10 cases and GII-b polymerase/GII-16 capsid in 1 case) by sequencing based on the RdRP and capsid genes. The putative recombination point in the recombinant strains was the ORF-1/ORF2 overlap, located at nucleotide 5,046 with reference to Lordsdale. In conclusion, GII-4/2006b variants were detected predominantly and a new recombinant strain (GII-4/GII-3) was found in the Korean children with gastroenteritis. Continuous monitoring of the genetic diversity of NoVs is important to determine the trend of the predominant genotype and new recombinant strain."
CD011926,0,23175264,0,Comparison of three different methods for detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in a tertiary pediatric care center.,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a well-known cause of sporadic and epidemic food-borne gastroenteritis. A low infectious dose, approximately 10 microorganisms, is sufficient to cause disease that may lead to hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The objective of this study was to compare the performances of an in-house real-time PCR, a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Premier EHEC; Meridian Bioscience), and culture on sorbitol MacConkey agar for the detection of STEC in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Of 632 stool samples tested, 21 were positive for STEC. All were detected by PCR, 6 were detected by EIA, and only 5 O157 STEC isolates were identified by culture. Among the 15 specimens falsely negative by EIA, there were 9 Stx1, 2 Stx2, and 4 Stx1 and Stx2 STEC isolates. The latter group included 2 O157 STEC isolates that would have been missed if only EIA had been performed. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study performed in a pediatric hospital which demonstrates the superiority of PCR over EIA for the detection of STEC. We conclude that PCR is specific and more sensitive than EIA. PCR should be considered for routine use in clinical settings where molecular detection facilities are available. Its lower limit of detection, equivalent to the infectious dose, is an obvious advantage for patient care and public health surveillance."
CD011926,0,18577034,0,Molecular analysis of Malassezia species isolated from hospitalized neonates.,"Malassezia species are a part of the skin microflora of neonates. Under certain circumstances, they can cause diseases ranging from simple pustulosis to lifethreatening fungemia in newborn infants. Little information is available about the epidemiology of Malassezia species in neonates. In the present study, we successfully isolated Malassezia yeasts from 68.7% of hospitalized neonates. Using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFPL), M. furfur (88.06%) was identified as the most isolated species, followed in frequency by M. globosa (10.48%), M. obtusa (0.73%), and M. slooffiae (0.73%). Among the variables studied, only a longer stay in the ward resulted in a higher colonization rate. Using multiple logistic regression, only the type of hospital and ward had some effects on the colonization rate. Our results supported the hypothesis that neonates acquire Malassezia flora through direct contact with their mothers or hospital personnel."
CD011926,0,11487264,0,South Asian ethnicity and material deprivation increase the risk of Epstein-Barr virus infection in childhood Hodgkin's disease.,"In order to further define the factors associated with the observed variations in the Epstein-Barr virus-positive rate in childhood Hodgkin's disease, we have studied the effect of material deprivation (measured by the Townsend score) and ethnic origin on the frequency of Epstein-Barr virus-positivity in 55 cases of childhood Hodgkin's disease, diagnosed between 1981 and 1999, from a multi-ethnic region of the United Kingdom. Epstein-Barr virus status was determined by immunohistochemistry for the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein-1. 62% of cases were Epstein-Barr virus-positive. Ethnic group was the strongest predictor of Epstein-Barr virus-positivity, with South Asians having a more than 20-fold risk of being Epstein-Barr virus-positive compared with non-South Asians. An increased risk was still present after adjusting for deprivation. Townsend scores were significantly higher (indicating more deprivation) in the Epstein-Barr virus-positive group, particularly in males. The relative risk of Epstein-Barr virus-positivity showed a gradient with increasing Townsend score; the risk being 7-times higher in the most deprived quartile compared with the least deprived group. Although the association between Townsend score and Epstein-Barr virus-positivity was reduced after adjusting for ethnic group, the risk of Epstein-Barr virus-positivity was still 3-times higher in the most deprived compared with the least deprived quartile. In addition, cases having 2 or more siblings were 5-times as likely to be Epstein-Barr virus-positive as those from smaller families. These results provide the first evidence of a strong association between Epstein-Barr virus-positive Hodgkin's disease and South Asian children from the United Kingdom. In addition, deprivation may increase the likelihood of Epstein-Barr virus-positive disease independently of ethnicity."

HCV RNA was found in 8 newborn babies delivered by women who were anti-HCV seropositive, and persisted for 2-19 months of follow-up. Anti-HCV detected in 7 infants cleared by 9 months and remained undetectable thereafter. Serum alanine aminotransferase was raised in 3 infants.

These methods have allowed a better understanding of the physiopathogeny of the disease. In particular, PCR has revealed the importance of asymptomatic viral shedding in infected patients. PCR helps diagnosis in many situations where viral isolation by culture proves difficult or impossible, i.e. in treated or atypical lesions, or in newborn central nervous system infections. In addition, PCR has underlined the existence of prolonged viremia in infected newborns. PCR helps sequencing of the viral genome for further epidemiological studies or analysis of resistance to antiviral drugs. Recent PCR-derived techniques have been developed to quantify viral load in real time, and allow to obtain a diagnosis in a few hours.

The aim of this study was to assess whether prenatal clinical or laboratory findings in pregnant women who had high risks for primary CMV infection predicted the presence of congenital infection. Fifty pregnant women who had serum CMV IgG and positive or borderline tests for serum CMV IgM were included in this prospective study. Serum IgG avidity was measured, and PCR was conducted for CMV DNA in maternal serum, urine, and uterine cervical secretion. All neonates underwent PCR testing for CMV DNA in the urine for the presence of congenital infection. Risk factors were compared between congenital infection group and group without congenital infection. As a result, nine neonates (18%) were diagnosed as having congenital infection. The frequencies of ultrasound fetal abnormality and positive test for CMV DNA in cervical secretion, CMV IgM titer and IgM/IgG ratio in the congenital infection group were significantly higher than those in the group without congenital infection. Conversely, IgG avidity index in the congenital infection group was significantly lower than that in the group without congenital infection. By multivariate logistic regression analyses, IgG avidity index (Odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-0.99) and ultrasound fetal abnormality (291.22, 2.72-31125.05), were selected independently as significant signs predictive of congenital CMV infection. Among pregnant women with positive or borderline tests for CMV IgM, when they have findings of low serum CMV IgG avidity or ultrasound fetal abnormality, the probability of congenital CMV infection may increase."

CD011926,0,23408689,0,Outbreak investigation using high-throughput genome sequencing within a diagnostic microbiology laboratory.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of bacterial genomes has recently become more accessible and is now available to the routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory. However, questions remain regarding its feasibility, particularly with respect to data analysis in nonspecialist centers. To test the applicability of NGS to outbreak investigations, Ion Torrent sequencing was used to investigate a putative multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli outbreak in the neonatal unit of the Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne, Australia. Four suspected outbreak strains and a comparator strain were sequenced. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis demonstrated that the four neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) strains were identical and easily differentiated from the comparator strain. Genome sequence data also determined that the NICU strains belonged to multilocus sequence type 131 and carried the bla(CTX-M-15) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Comparison of the outbreak strains to all publicly available complete E. coli genome sequences showed that they clustered with neonatal meningitis and uropathogenic isolates. The turnaround time from a positive culture to the completion of sequencing (prior to data analysis) was 5 days, and the cost was approximately $300 per strain (for the reagents only). The main obstacles to a mainstream adoption of NGS technologies in diagnostic microbiology laboratories are currently cost (although this is decreasing), a paucity of user-friendly and clinically focused bioinformatics platforms, and a lack of genomics expertise outside the research environment. Despite these hurdles, NGS technologies provide unparalleled high-resolution genotyping in a short time frame and are likely to be widely implemented in the field of diagnostic microbiology in the next few years, particularly for epidemiological investigations (replacing current typing methods) and the characterization of resistance determinants. Clinical microbiologists need to familiarize themselves with these technologies and their applications."
CD011926,0,12454133,0,Laboratory diagnosis and genetic analysis of an echovirus 30-associated outbreak of aseptic meningitis in Taiwan in 2001.,"A large outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred from April to November 2001 in Taiwan. Of the 1,130 enterovirus-infected patients, echovirus 30 (E30) infection was diagnosed in 188 (16.6%), with the patients having various clinical manifestations including aseptic meningitis (73.9%), young infant fever (6.9%), respiratory symptoms or herpangina (13.3%), or others (5.9%). The majority of the E30-infected patients were between 3 and 10 years old. Of the 264 E30 strains identified, 94.3, 71, and 67.4% were isolated from RD, MRC-5, and A549 cells, respectively. Primary isolation of E30 required mean times of 3.7 days for RD cells and 4.1 days for MRC-5 and A549 cells. Among all E30-positive patients, virus was most frequently isolated from throat swab specimens (85.2%) and, to a lesser extent, stool (76.4%) or cerebrospinal fluid (70.1%) specimens. The virus isolates were initially identified as echovirus 4 (E4) on the basis of immunofluorescence staining with anti-E4 and anti-E30 (Bastianni prototype) monoclonal antibodies. However, upon performance of the neutralization test, E30-specific reverse transcription-PCR, and sequencing of the VP1 gene, the results identified these isolates as E30, not E4, indicating that the reagent used to type E30, which is produced with the Bastianni strain as the immunogen, is inadequate for the identification of recent E30 isolates in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analyses of the VP1 genes of these isolates showed that their sequences differed from those of E30 isolates from the GenBank database by 9.1 to 25.2%, suggesting that this outbreak was caused by a new variant strain of E30 introduced into Taiwan in 2000 that resulted in the widespread aseptic meningitis epidemic in 2001."

Rarely in utero, the transmission frequently occurs during delivery. The disease may be disseminated, localized to the central nervous system, or involving skin, eye and/or mouth. Mortality rates markedly decreased with high-dose antiviral treatment. Diagnosis of neonatal infection is based on viral isolation from ulcerated vesicles or by scarifying mucocutaneous lesions. Recently polymerase chain reaction plays a central role for both viral detection (skin, mucosal, cerebrospinal fluid samples) and response to therapy.

At the time of the present study, HIV infection resulting from maternofetal transmission was found in 50 cases, while 108 infants were not infected; HIV infection remained uncertain in 16 cases; 5 infants were lost for follow-up. Out of the 50 infected cases, 20 were less than two-year old, 17 were 2-5 year old and 13 were older than 5 years. Very few remained asymptomatic after the age of 6 months, the most common symptoms being adenopathies and/or hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly. Twenty-six had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Six died, from pneumocystosis (3), cytomegalovirus infection (1) and septicemia (2). Virus culture and polymerase chain reaction were the most efficient laboratory methods for early diagnosis of HIV infection, both being positive in more than 95% of the infected cases after the age of 3 months. A close clinical and biological supervision is recommended in these infants and children because of the permanent threat of infectious diseases in relation to their immunodeficiency. Treatment associates: 1) antiviral therapy with AZT as soon as the HIV infection is diagnosed; 2) primary prophylaxis against pneumocystosis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol; 3) IV immunoglobulins in the case of repeated bacterial infection; 4) regular evaluation of the nutritional status and psychological assistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Diagnosis based on specific serologic tests is simple after the age of 18 months. In the perinatal period, however, viral isolation by culture or polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification or both appears to be less sensitive than in the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Disease progression is far slower than with human immunodeficiency virus type 1, but severe immunodeficiency can occur."
CD011926,0,22137682,0,Validation of a polymerase chain reaction-oligochromatography test for detection of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus.,"The outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus caused the first influenza pandemic disease of the 21st century. In August 2010, the pandemic moved into the post-pandemic period. However, localized outbreaks of various magnitudes continued with a higher rate of disease severity. The aim of this study was to assess a new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-oligochromatographic assay (Speed-Oligo) in the diagnosis of novel influenza A (H1N1) 2009. A total of 405 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 400 pediatric and adults patients with suspected infection of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 were analyzed. The sensitivity and specificity values of the Speed-Oligo assay in comparison to reverse transcriptase-PCR assay developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were 86.5% and 92.2%, respectively. The new assay is simple, rapid, and provides a good sensitivity for detection of influenza A (H1N1) 2009. This assay might be a good alternative to real-time PCR assays for laboratories not equipped with real-time PCR instruments."
CD011926,0,23039034,0,Lopinavir/Ritonavir versus Lamivudine peri-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV-1 transmission by breastfeeding: the PROMISE-PEP trial Protocol ANRS 12174.,"Postnatal transmission of HIV-1 through breast milk remains an unsolved challenge in many resource-poor settings where replacement feeding is not a safe alternative. WHO now recommends breastfeeding of infants born to HIV-infected mothers until 12 months of age, with either maternal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or peri-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in infants using nevirapine. As PEP, lamivudine showed a similar efficacy and safety as nevirapine, but with an expected lower rate of resistant HIV strains emerging in infants who fail PEP, and lower restrictions for future HIV treatment. Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is an attractive PEP candidate with presumably higher efficacy against HIV than nevirapine or lamivudine, and a higher genetic barrier to resistance selection. It showed an acceptable safety profile for the treatment of very young HIV-infected infants. The ANRS 12174 study aims to compare the risk of HIV-1 transmission during and safety of prolonged infant PEP with LPV/r (40/10 mg twice daily if 2-4 kg and 80/20 mg twice daily if >4 kg) versus Lamivudine (7,5 mg twice daily if 2-4 kg, 25 mg twice daily if 4-8 kg and 50 mg twice daily if >8 kg) from day 7 until one week after cessation of BF (maximum 50 weeks of prophylaxis) to prevent postnatal HIV-1 acquisition between 7 days and 50 weeks of age."
CD011926,0,9025692,0,Geographic differences in the sensitivity of a polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection.,"The amplification of target DNA by highly specific probes using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a highly sensitive and specific method for the detection of malaria infection. The use the of PCR in settings with varying endemicity within one survey area has not been investigated intensively. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted in the districts of Kabarole and Bundibugyo in western Uganda using material from three villages with different epidemiologic situations regarding malaria and DNA primers for a PCR that had shown satisfactory sensitivity and specificity in previous trials. The sensitivity of the PCR varied significantly (P < 0.001) in the three survey villages (between 63.2% and 83.9% for the primer pair K1-14-1 and between 37.9% and 69.9% for the primer pair MSP-1) and was highly linked to geographic differences and social exchanges of the inhabitants with other areas of the district. According to the results of this investigation, it is advisable not to use a single primer pair in epidemiologic field studies for the detection of falciparum malaria. The use of combined primer pairs and the frequent confirmation of the results by microscopy are recommended."
CD011926,0,15476127,0,Differential clinical manifestations of congenital cytomegalovirus infection between dizygotic twins: a case report.,"To understand a mechanism for the difference in clinical manifestations of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection between dizygotic twins, the placentas of the dizygotic twins were evaluated for the number of the cells infected with CMV by immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies. A Japanese woman with dizygotic twin pregnancy had immunoglobulin M antibodies to CMV at 15 weeks gestation. Intrauterine growth retardation was noted only in the first twin. At birth, CMV was isolated from urine culture in both twins. Clinical manifestations for CMV, such as petechiae, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and deafness were more pronounced in the first twin than in the second twin. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies showed CMV-positive cells two or three times more densely distributed in the placenta of the first twin compared with the second twin. These data suggest the severity of CMV manifestations of dizygotic twins may be in accord with the number of CMV-positive cells in the placenta."
CD011926,0,12437029,0,"Outbreak of central nervous system disease associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease in Japan during the summer of 2000: detection and molecular epidemiology of enterovirus 71.","Few outbreaks of the serious enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections, which affect the central nervous system (CNS), had been reported in Japan before 2000. During June through August 2000, a patient died of pulmonary edema caused by brainstem encephalitis accompanied by EV71-induced hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), and many patients complicated by serious CNS disease, including paralysis, were hospitalized in a restricted area in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan (K-area). During the same period, endemics of HFMD were reported in other areas in Hyogo Prefecture, where EV71 was isolated from HFMD patients, but few patients developed aseptic meningitis. The isolations of EV71 from K-area patients were difficult with the use of Vero cells, so the strains were isolated by use of GL37 cells; Vero cells, however, could isolate EV71 strains from other areas in Hyogo Prefecture. We sequenced VP4 coding regions of these EV71 isolates and found that the isolates from K-area had the same sequence, which, except for one isolate, was different from the sequences of EV71 strains isolated from other areas of Hyogo Prefecture. Although these results were not enough to state that EV71 from K-area was a virulent strain, it seemed reasonable to conclude that serious CNS diseases in K-area were caused by EV71 because it was the only infectious agent detected in the inpatients of K-area."
CD011926,0,10674351,0,Detection of microorganisms in the tracheal aspirates of preterm infants by polymerase chain reaction: association of adenovirus infection with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Because the role of congenital infections in BPD has been debated, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that detection of infectious agents in tracheal aspirate samples was associated with the development of BPD. Tracheal aspirate samples were obtained within the 1st week of life and screened by polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, enteroviruses, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia species. BPD was defined as persistent oxygen dependence at 28 d of age and 36 wk postconceptional age (PCA). Infants that expired before these time points were excluded from statistical analysis. Out of 89 infants studied, at 28 d of life, 13 had expired, 45 had BPD, and 31 had no BPD (controls). At 36 wk PCA, 15 infants expired, 39 still had BPD, and 35 did not. A significant increase in the frequency of adenovirus genome was identified in BPD patients compared with controls, both at 28 d of life (12/45 = 27% versus 1/31 = 3%: p< or =0.01) and at 36 wk PCA (10/39 = 29% versus 2/35 = 6%: p = 0.01). Other microorganisms were rarely detected and not associated with the development of BPD. This is the first study reporting the frequency of detection of adenovirus DNA in tracheal aspirate samples obtained during the 1st week of life from infants with BPD and suggests that prenatal acquisition may be important in the development of BPD."
CD011926,0,24388336,1,Comparison of 16S rRNA gene PCR and blood culture for diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.,"Septicemia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns in the developing world. However, accurate clinical diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is often difficult because symptoms and signs are often nonspecific. Blood culture has been the gold standard for confirmation of the diagnosis. However, the sensitivity is low and results are usually not promptly obtained. Therefore, the diagnosis of sepsis is often based on clinical signs in association with laboratory tests such as platelets count, immature/total neutrophils ratio (I/T), and a rise in C-reactive protein (CRP). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for the detection of neonatal sepsis represent new diagnostic tools for the early identification of pathogens."

All the patients have multiple dysmorphic features. Nearly all the patients (94%) have Paris-Trousseau syndrome characterized by thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction. In total, 56% of the patients have serious congenital heart defects. Cognitive function ranged from normal intelligence to moderate mental retardation. Nearly half of the patients have mild mental retardation with a characteristic neuropsychiatric profile demonstrating near normal receptive language ability, but mild to moderate impairment in expressive language. Ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary problems were common, as were gross and fine motor delays. Infections of the upper respiratory system were common, but no life-threatening infections were reported. We include a molecular analysis of the deletion breakpoints in 65 patients, from which genetic ""critical regions"" for 14 clinical phenotypes are defined, as well as for the neuropsychiatric profiles. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of recommendations for the clinical management of patients with the 11q terminal deletion disorder."
CD011926,0,9204240,0,Neonatal infections.,"Neonatal infections range from early-onset vertically acquired infections to nosocomial bacterial sepsis, and they account for significant morbidity and mortality globally. The recent emergence of perinatally acquired HIV-1 infection has also placed an enormous burden on existing meager health resources in developing countries. The risk of early-onset group B streptococci sepsis may be related to heavy genital tract colonization at term. Perinatally acquired HIV-1 infection also occurs at birth, with higher rates of infection after vaginal delivery. Detection of circulation HIV-1 viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction offers an extremely sensitive screening method in the neonatal period. In contrast, rapid confirmation of bacterial sepsis in the newborn still poses considerable problems. A review of data on antimicrobial prophylaxis of preterm premature rupture of membranes does reveal improved neonatal outcome. However, the rapid and widespread emergence of multidrug resistance among bacterial pathogens dictates the need for judicious use of antibiotics, as well as close attention to preventive strategies."

The patient was prepared with Thiotepa and Cytoxan and received a nucleated cell dose of 3.0 x 10(7)/kg. Cyclosporin A and Methylprednisolone was given for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. An ANC of 0.5 x 10(9)/L and 1.0 x 10(9)/L were achieved on post-transplant days 18 and 28, respectively. Platelet recovery was rapid with a platelet count > or = 100 x 10(9)/L on day +39. On posttransplant day +11, the patient developed an erythematous rash consistent with grade I acute GVHD that resolved without therapy. He was discharged day on +60 and has remained free of infections with a normal platelet count off all immunosuppression therapy 30+ months post-transplantation. Chimerism studies performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization indicated that the percentage of donor cells ranged between 55 and 80%. The phenotype and function of peripheral blood lymphocytes are completely normal and the patient has responded in vivo with production of antibodies to both diphtheria and tetanus immunizations. This study demonstrates the feasibility of collecting placental blood after a multiple birth delivery and the ability of umbilical cord blood to provide complete hematopoietic and immunologic reconstitution in a patient with WAS."
CD011926,0,19950234,0,High prevalence of species D human adenoviruses in fecal specimens from Urban Kenyan children with diarrhea.,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) cause a wide range of clinical syndromes and are classified in seven species, A-G, comprising 52 serotypes. HAdV-A31, -F40, and -F41 have been associated with diarrhea in infants and young children. In developing countries gastroenteritis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and, in comparison to rotaviruses, there are no data on the HAdVs associated with diarrhea in pediatric patients in Kenya. This study investigates the prevalence and genotypes of HAdVs in 278 stool specimens (211 diarrheal; 67 non-diarrheal) from children < or =14 years of age in urban and rural areas in Kenya. Stool specimens were screened for HAdVs using a nested polymerase chain reaction and the HAdVs genotyped by sequence analysis of a conserved hexon gene fragment. HAdVs were detected in 104/278 (37.4%) of the stool specimens: 35/43 (81.4%) of diarrheal and 10/61 (16.4%) of non-diarrheal stool specimens from children in an urban hospice; 25/94 (26.6%) of diarrheal specimens from urban children and 34/80 (42.5%) of diarrheal specimens from children in a rural area. Species D HAdVs were identified as the most prevalent HAdV species in diarrheal stool specimens from urban children comprising 18/37 (48.6%) of the strains identified. In contrast HAdV species F predominated in pediatric diarrheal specimens from the rural area, being identified in 7/16 (43.8%) of the characterized strains. This study provides valuable new data on the prevalence and distribution of HAdV genotypes in diarrheal stool specimens in Kenya and Africa, and highlights the necessity for further investigations."

CD011926,0,8291592,0,Comparative diagnosis of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis by polymerase chain reaction and McCoy cell culture.,"Cervical and ocular swabs from 100 mother/newborn pairs delivering on the clinic service were assayed for Chlamydia trachomatis with standard McCoy cell culture and with standard and biotinylated polymerase chain reaction techniques, using primers directed against the major outer membrane protein gene and C. trachomatis-specific cryptic plasmid, respectively. Using the polymerase chain reaction, 20 (20%) mothers and seven (7%) neonates were positive for Chlamydia. All neonates positive by polymerase chain reaction were from mothers positive by polymerase chain reaction, yielding a 35% transmission rate. Only five of 20 (25%) mothers and two of seven (28%) neonates positive by polymerase chain reaction were positive by cell culture. All cell culture samples were positive by polymerase chain reaction testing. Culture and polymerase chain reaction analysis two weeks after treatment with oral erythromycin were negative. The polymerase chain reaction assay appears to be equally specific and more sensitive than McCoy cell culture for the detection of C. trachomatis from ocular specimens."

One had an encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2); the other had a disseminated infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Confirmation of the diagnosis was obtained by use of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify viral DNA from paraffin sections of autopsy tissues. By using primers which amplify fragments of the HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene and HSV-2 glycoprotein gene respectively it was possible to discriminate between infection with HSV-1 and HSV-2. In contrast, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization using commercially available reagents did not distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection. However, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization are probably more reliable than the polymerase chain reaction for assessment of the distribution of virus in different tissues."
CD011926,0,20660189,0,Genetic analyses of HIV-1 env sequences demonstrate limited compartmentalization in breast milk and suggest viral replication within the breast that increases with mastitis.,"The concentration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is generally lower in breast milk than in blood. Mastitis, or inflammation of the breast, is associated with increased levels of milk HIV-1 and risk of mother-to-child transmission through breastfeeding. We hypothesized that mastitis facilitates the passage of HIV-1 from blood into milk or stimulates virus production within the breast. HIV-1 env sequences were generated from single amplicons obtained from breast milk and blood samples in a cross-sectional study. Viral compartmentalization was evaluated using several statistical methods, including the Slatkin and Maddison (SM) test. Mastitis was defined as an elevated milk sodium (Na(+)) concentration. The association between milk Na(+) and the pairwise genetic distance between milk and blood viral sequences was modeled using linear regression. HIV-1 was compartmentalized within milk by SM testing in 6/17 (35%) specimens obtained from 9 women, but all phylogenetic clades included viral sequences from milk and blood samples. Monotypic sequences were more prevalent in milk samples than in blood samples (22% versus 13%; P = 0.012), which accounted for half of the compartmentalization observed. Mastitis was not associated with compartmentalization by SM testing (P = 0.621), but Na(+) was correlated with greater genetic distance between milk and blood HIV-1 populations (P = 0.041). In conclusion, local production of HIV-1 within the breast is suggested by compartmentalization of virus and a higher prevalence of monotypic viruses in milk specimens. However, phylogenetic trees demonstrate extensive mixing of viruses between milk and blood specimens. HIV-1 replication in breast milk appears to increase with inflammation, contributing to higher milk viral loads during mastitis."

CD011926,0,24486081,0,Maple Syrup Urine Disease Complicated with Kyphoscoliosis and Myelopathy.,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive aminoacidopathy secondary to an enzyme defect in the catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine, and valine). Accumulation of their corresponding keto-acids leads to encephalopathy if not treated in time. A newborn male patient was suspected to have MSUD after tandem mass study when he presented symptoms and signs suggestive neonatal sepsis, anemia, and diarrhea. Food restriction of BCAAs was started; however, acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin eruptions occurred at age 2 months. The skin rashes resolved after adding BCAAs and adjusting the infant formula. At age 7 months, he suffered from recurrent skin lesions, zinc deficiency, osteoporosis, and kyphosis of the thoracic spine with acute angulation over the T11-T12 level associated with spinal compression and myelopathy. After supplementation of zinc products and pamidronate, skin lesions and osteopenia improved gradually. Direct sequencing of the DBT gene showed a compound heterozygous mutation [4.7 kb deletion and c.650-651insT (L217F or L217fsX223)]. It is unusual that neurodegeneration still developed in this patient despite diet restriction. Additionally, brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging, bone mineral density study, and monitoring of zinc status are suggested in MSUD patients."

From December 2006 to March 2009, 894 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children under 14 years of age with ARTIs. Samples were screened for HRSV and genotyped by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. Demographic and clinical information was recorded. A total of 38.14% (341/894) of samples were positive for HRSV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 60.4% of the selected 227 RSV strains were GA2, 34.4% were BA, 4.8% were GB2, and 0.4% were GB3. A total of 40.47% of all of the RSV-positive samples were coinfected with other respiratory viruses, and adenovirus was the most common additional respiratory virus. No statistical differences were found in the frequency of diagnosis and symptoms between the coinfection group and monoinfection group. Additionally, no statistical differences were found in epidemiological characterizations or disease severity between genotype BA- and GA2-positive patients, except for a greater frequency of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (mostly bronchitis)with BA. HRSV is the most important viral pathogen in Chinese children with ARTIs. Four genotypes (i.e., GA2, BA, GB2, and GB3) circulate locally, and the predominant genotype may shift between seasons. Coinfection with other viruses does not affect disease severity. HRSV genotypes were not associated with different epidemiological characterizations or disease severity."

It may allow the diagnosis of HIV infection before p24 antigen and antibodies become detectable. However, its effectiveness for early diagnosis should still be investigated systematically. The routine application of PCR is problematic at the moment because this technique is highly complex and time-consuming. Future developments should aim on one hand at a simplification of the technique and on the other hand at possibilities for quantitation. By allowing measurement of viral burden (provirus frequency in lymphocytes, virus concentration in plasma), PCR will be a decisive aid for follow-up controls of seropositive patients."

This is accompanied by an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and Kaposi's sarcoma, an endothelial cell-derived tumor. We investigated the impact of maternal HIV-1 infection on phenotype and gene expression of endothelial cells in newborns. For this reason endothelial precursor cells and differentiated endothelial cells were isolated from cord blood as well as from umbilical veins and arteries of noninfected infants born to HIV-1-infected (H-group) and noninfected (Ngroup) mothers. No apparent differences in proliferation, capillary formation, and expression of endothelial cell markers were detected in these cells. Interestingly, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase was repressed significantly (X2 analysis, p < 0.002) and consistently at the RNA, the protein, and the secretory levels in the H-group as compared to the N-group. Neither treatment with zidovudine (AZT), mutations in the matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) promoter, nor epigenetic changes in the promoter methylation pattern were responsible for the repression of MMP-1 expression in H-group endothelial cells. The reduced MMP-1 expression may contribute to the impaired cardiac function that has been observed in children of HIV-1-infected women. Most interestingly, our findings indicate that HIV-1-related effects can be transferred from mother to child in the absence of HIV-1 transmission."

The relative frequencies of specific EV and HPeV types were determined over a 5-year surveillance period using highly sensitive EV and HPeV PCR assays for screening 4,168 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens collected from hospitalized individuals between 2005 and 2010 in Edinburgh. Positive CSF samples were typed by sequencing of VP1. From the 201 EV and 31 HPeV positive (uncultured) CSF samples on screening, a high proportion of available samples could be directly typed (176/182, 97%). Highest frequencies of EV infections occurred in young adults (n = 43; 8.6%) although a remarkably high proportion of positive samples (n = 98; 46%) were obtained from young infants (<3 months). HPeV infections were seen exclusively in children under the age of 3 months (31/1,105; 2.8%), and confined to spring on even-numbered years (22% in March 2006, 25% in April 2008, and 22% in March 2010). In contrast, EV infections were distributed widely across the years. Twenty different EV serotypes were detected; E9, E6, and CAV9 being found most frequently, whereas all but one HPeVs were type 3. Over this period, HPeV3 was identified as the most prevalent picornavirus type in CNS-related infections with similarly high incidences of EV infection frequencies in very young children. The highly sensitive virus typing methods applied in this study will assist further EV and HPeV screening of sepsis and meningitis cases as well as in future molecular epidemiological studies and population surveillance."

We report a case of differential fetal infection following maternal parvovirus B19 infection in a dichorionic twin pregnancy culminating in a dual live-birth. A 32-year-old woman was diagnosed with parvovirus infection following exposure to her infected child at 19 weeks' gestation in a dichorionic twin gestation. Maternal IgG seroconversion was documented and maternal blood parvovirus B19 DNA was detected by PCR testing. Fetal monitoring with serial ultrasound assessment was instituted. At 25 weeks' gestation Twin I (male) displayed minor ascites, small pericardial effusion, placentomegaly and oligohydramnios. Middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA PSV) studies were abnormal. Twin II (female) was sonographically unremarkable. A single fetal intravascular transfusion for Twin I was performed (pretransfusion Hb 80 g/L). Twin I fetal blood parvovirus B19 DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum demonstrated both B19 IgG and IgM. Following fetal transfusion the hydrops resolved, although the placentomegaly persisted. Two live infants were delivered at 37 weeks' gestation. Individual neonatal venepuncture detected B19 DNA by PCR in Twin I but not in Twin II. B19 IgM was present in Twin I but not Twin II. Both neonates had B19 IgG antibodies. Placental histopathology demonstrated mild edema for Twin I but no inclusion cells. The placenta of Twin II was unremarkable. This case demonstrates the ability for differential transplacental infection of this virus and the assistance of fetal MCA flow studies to guide therapy in a multiple pregnancy at risk of parvovirus infection."

This study aimed to determine the distribution of several respiratory viruses in children diagnosed as having influenza-like illness, over the winter period of 2005-2008. Molecular assays including conventional and real time PCR protocols, were employed to screen respiratory specimens, collected by clinicians of the Influenza sentinel system and of outpatient pediatric clinics, for identification of several respiratory viruses. Of 1,272 specimens tested, 814 (64%) were positive for at least one virus and included 387 influenza viruses, 160 rhinoviruses, 155 respiratory syncytial viruses, 95 adenoviruses, 81 bocaviruses, 47 parainfluenza viruses, 44 metapneumoviruses, and 30 coronaviruses. Simultaneous presence of two or three viruses was observed in 173 of the above positive cases, 21% of which included influenza virus and rhinovirus. The majority of positive cases occurred during January and February. Influenza virus predominated in children older than 1 year old, with type B being the dominant type for the first season and subtypes A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 the following two winter seasons, respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus prevailed in children younger than 2 years old, with subtypes A and B alternating from year to year.

Patterns of circulating RSV genotypes can provide a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of RSV infection. We retrospectively analyzed the genetic diversity of RSV infection in hospitalized children with acute RTI admitted to University Hospital Heidelberg/Germany between October 2012 and April 2013. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were routinely obtained in 240 children younger than 2 years of age who presented with clinical symptoms of upper or lower RTI. We analyzed NPAs via PCR and sequence analysis of the second variable region of the RSV G gene coding for the attachment glycoprotein. We obtained medical records reviewing routine clinical data. RSV was detected in 134/240 children. In RSV-positive patients the most common diagnosis was bronchitis/bronchiolitis (75.4%). The mean duration of hospitalization was longer in RSV-positive compared to RSV-negative patients (3.5 vs. 5.1 days; p<0.01). RSV-A was detected in 82.1%, RSV-B in 17.9% of all samples. Phylogenetic analysis of 112 isolates revealed that the majority of RSV-A strains (65%) belonged to the novel ON1 genotype containing a 72-nucleotide duplication. However, genotype ON1 was not associated with a more severe course of illness when taking basic clinical/laboratory parameters into account. Molecular characterization of RSV confirms the co-circulation of multiple genotypes of subtype RSV-A and RSV-B. The duplication in the G gene of genotype ON1 might have an effect on the rapid spread of this emerging RSV strain."

A 1-year study was undertaken on children hospitalized consecutively for acute respiratory infection in a Pediatric Department in Rome to characterize the viruses involved. Two hundred twenty-seven children were enrolled in the study with a diagnosis of asthma, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, or laringo-tracheo bronchitis. A molecular approach was adopted using specific reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays detecting 13 respiratory viruses including metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the novel coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1; most amplified fragments were sequenced to confirm positive results and differentiate the strain. Viral pathogens were detected in 97 samples (42.7%), with 4.8% of dual infections identified; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 17.2% of children, followed by rhinovirus (9.7%), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) (7.5%), and influenza type A (4.4%). Interestingly, more than half the patients (9/17) that have rhinovirus as the sole respiratory pathogen had pneumonia. HMPV infected children below 3 years in two peaks in March and June causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia. One case of NL63 infection is described, documenting NL63 circulation in central Italy.

Long-term surveillance studies of rotavirus gastroenteritis in Malawian children have provided an opportunity to undertake a study of the importance and epidemiological features of norovirus infection in this population. Faecal specimens were collected from children <5 years of age admitted to hospital with acute diarrhoea, as well as from a comparison group of diarrhoea-free children, in Blantyre, Malawi between 1997 and 2007. Norovirus was detected using real-time PCR and strains genotyped by nucleotide sequence analysis. Norovirus was detected in 220/1,941 (11.3%) faecal specimens, comprising genogroup GI (1.8%), GII (9.4%) and mixed GI/GII (0.1%). The median age of children with norovirus was 6 months (range, 0-48 months). Norovirus was detected throughout the year, with peaks at the end of the rainy season (March) and towards the end of the dry season (August-November). Norovirus GII.4 was the most commonly detected genotype accounting for 70% of strains characterised, followed by GII.2 (6%), GII.6 (4%) and GII.12 (4%). Sub typing of GII.4 noroviruses demonstrated local circulation of strains prior to their subsequent detection in association with global epidemics of gastroenteritis. The prevalence of norovirus in children without diarrhoea was similar to the level in cases. This largest study to date of norovirus infection in African children indicates the potential role of paediatric surveillance in predicting the emergence of norovirus strains with global epidemic potential."

Here, a retrospective study was carried out to investigate whether antimicrobial resistance patterns could be used to detect these pathogens in a French university hospital. Isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR profiling (PVL genes and tst), PFGE typing and multilocus sequence typing. Demographic and clinical data were collected from all patients. For PVL-positive MRSA, the typical antimicrobial resistance pattern (susceptible to fluoroquinolones, non-susceptible to fusidic acid, kanamycin resistant and susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin) had a sensitivity of 77.8 % and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100 %. For tst-positive MRSA, the antimicrobial resistance pattern (susceptible to fluoroquinolones and non-susceptible to fusidic acid) had a sensitivity of 100 % and a PPV of 72.4 %. These results suggest that phenotypic rules based on antimicrobial resistance patterns are potentially useful for the detection of PVL- and tst-positive MRSA isolates."

CD011926,0,17287263,0,Identification of a third human polyomavirus.,"We have previously reported on a system for large-scale molecular virus screening of clinical samples. As part of an effort to systematically search for unrecognized human pathogens, the technology was applied for virus screening of human respiratory tract samples. This resulted in the identification of a previously unknown polyomavirus provisionally named KI polyomavirus. The virus is phylogenetically related to other primate polyomaviruses in the early region of the genome but has very little homology (<30% amino acid identity) to known polyomaviruses in the late region. The virus was found by PCR in 6 (1%) of 637 nasopharyngeal aspirates and in 1 (0.5%) of 192 fecal samples but was not detected in sets of urine and blood samples. Since polyomaviruses have oncogenic potential and may produce severe disease in immunosuppressed individuals, continued searching for the virus in different medical contexts is important. This finding further illustrates how unbiased screening of respiratory tract samples can be used for the discovery of diverse virus types."

In this first report from Turkey, we investigated the molecular markers that have been associated with increased virulence and oseltamivir resistance. We also conducted serological studies in people after infection, vaccination, exposure, and no-exposure controls to determine the level of protection against the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Thirteen rRT-PCR positive samples were analyzed for presence of mutations that have been associated with host range, virulence, and antiviral resistance: substitution D222G in the HA, E627K in the PB2, and H275Y in the neuraminidase (NA). In addition, 135 serum samples from vaccinated, recovered, asymptomatic contacts, and control individuals were tested using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. D222G was detected in nasal samples from two severe cases. No specified mutations in the PB2 and NA were identified. Additional substitutions, I216V, V321I, E374K, S203T in HA, V655I in PB2, and I163V in NA, were detected. HI testing from vaccinated individuals, recovered patients, asymptomatic contacts, and control individuals showed that 97.9, 99.7, 88.2, and 44.2 % had HI titers ≥40, respectively. Molecular markers promoting influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 to become a pandemic virus are still under investigation.

Primary CMV infection occurs in 1 to 4% of seronegative women during pregnancy and may be transmitted to the fetus in 40% of cases. Up to 10% of intrauterine CMV infections result in symptomatic congenital disease at birth. Half of these children and 13% of those born with asymptomatic infection will develop long-term sequelae, especially neurosensory hearing loss and mental retardation. Accurate diagnosis of primary maternal and fetal infection is now possible using the avidity index of anti-CMV IgG and virological testing to detect the virus in amniotic fluid. Symptomatic congenital infection may be preventable using CMV hyperimmune globulin during pregnancy. The gold standard for diagnosis of congenital CMV infection is the detection of the virus in urine within the first 2 weeks of life by rapid cell culture techniques (shell vial) or nucleic acid amplification of viral DNA (PCR). Retrospective diagnosis can be achieved by detection of viral DNA by PCR in dried blood spots (Guthrie card) collected on filter paper in the first days of life. Currently available drugs for the treatment of congenital CMV include ganciclovir and its oral prodrug valganciclovir. Treatment with intravenous ganciclovir for six weeks may prevent hearing deterioration in children with symptomatic congenital CMV infection and central nervous system involvement. Valganciclovir may be an excellent alternative because of its good bio-availability, providing plasma concentrations similar to those achieved with intravenous ganciclovir."
CD011926,0,22245566,0,Production of large numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells with functional activities from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells: use of interleukin-3.,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), a subset of dendritic cells characterized by a rapid and massive type-I interferon secretion through the Toll-like receptor pathway in response to viral infection, play important roles in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as chronic viral infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus), autoimmunity (e.g., psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus), and cancer. As pDC represent a rare cell type in the peripheral blood, the goal of this study was to develop a new method to efficiently generate large numbers of cells from a limited number of CD34(+) cord blood progenitors to provide a tool to resolve important questions about how pDC mediate tolerance, autoimmunity, and cancer. Human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from cord blood were cultured with a combination of Flt3-ligand (Flt3L), thrombopoietin (TPO), and one of the following cytokine: interleukin (IL)-3, interferon-β(IFN-β), or prostaglandin E2(PGE(2)). Cells obtained in the different culture conditions were analyzed for their phenotype and functional characteristics. The addition of IL-3 cooperates with Flt3L and TPO in the induction of pDC from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. Indeed, Flt3L/TPO alone or supplemented with prostaglandin E2 or interferon-β produced smaller amounts of pDC from hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition, pDC generated in Flt3L/TPO/IL-3 cultures exhibited morphological, immunohistochemical, and functional features of peripheral blood pDC. We showed that IL-3, in association with Flt3L and TPO, provides an advantageous tool for large-scale generation of pDC. This culture condition generated, starting from 2 × 10(5) CD34(+) cells, up to 2.6 × 10(6) pDC presenting features of blood pDC."

The antenatal coverage of pregnant women with nevirapine (NVP)+/-zidovudine (AZT) was 100%. Of 443 antenatal and post-natal care women who underwent CD4 test, 54.4% collected results. About 16.3% of those who collected results were started on antiretroviral treatment. The percentage of postpartum women discharged with unknown HIV status fell by 64.8%. About 91.5% of HIV-positive women received intrapartum antiretroviral prophylaxis of stat dose NVP and AZT + lamivudine with 1-week postpartum tail. From the exposed newborns, 98.8% received NVP stat dose and AZT. A total of 304 HIV exposed infants of age six weeks to 18 months underwent DNA-PCR test.

CD011926,0,7814466,0,Transmission of the human polyomavirus JC virus occurs both within the family and outside the family.,"JC polyomavirus (JCV) is a ubiquitous symbiote in the human population, infecting children asymptomatically and then persisting in renal tissue. We reevaluated the urinary excretion of JCV in subjects in various age groups using PCR. The detection rate for urinary JCV DNA was 9 to 17% until the age of 20 years; this rate increased dramatically to about 46% at the ages of 20 to 29 years and then increased gradually with age. Therefore, it appears that in most people excretion of JCV begins at the age of 20 to 29 years, which is earlier than suggested previously. Next, we studied the way in which JCV is spread in the human population. We selected eight Japanese families in which both parents and children excreted JCV in their urine. Their JCV subtypes were determined by PCR amplification of a JCV DNA fragment; this was followed by restriction enzyme analysis. JCV species in all JCV-positive family members were classified into either of the two subtypes, subtypes CY and MY, which are prevalent in the Japanese population. The following features of JCV subtype distribution were seen in the families: (i) both subtypes were detected in children of five of the eight families, and (ii) of 21 children who excreted JCV, 14 children excreted the same subtypes excreted by their mothers or fathers, while the remainder (7 children) excreted subtypes different from those excreted by their parents. These features suggest that JCV is transmitted both within the family and outside the family. The data also indicate that vertical transmission is not common in the spread of JCV."

The role of other viral respiratory pathogens has not been studied in this population. YK Delta children <3 years of age hospitalized with respiratory infections and same aged community control children were prospectively enrolled between October 2005 and September 2007. Polymerase chain reaction detection of viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal samples. Characteristics of hospitalized and asymptomatic control children were analyzed. From October 2005 to September 2007, 440 hospitalized and 425 control children were analyzed. Respiratory viruses were detected in 90% (395) of hospitalized children: 194 (44%) rhinovirus, 131 (30%) adenovirus, 102 (23%) RSV, 77 (18%) para influenza viruses (PIV), 66 (15%) human metapneumovirus (hMPV), 23 (5%) influenza, and 25 (6%) coronavirus. Fifty-two percent (221) of control children had a virus detected, most commonly rhinovirus (33%), and adenovirus (16%). RSV, PIV, hMPV, and influenza were significantly more common in hospitalized cases than control children, but rhinovirus, adenovirus, and coronavirus were not. RSV and hMPV were associated with higher severity of illness. In this study, RSV remains the most important virus associated with respiratory hospitalization, although hMPV and PIV were also common. RSV and hMPV were associated with more severe illness. Rhinovirus and adenovirus were detected in two-thirds of hospitalized children, but their frequent detection in control children made their role in respiratory hospitalization uncertain."

In this study, we evaluated the Qiagen ResPlex II V2.0 kit and explored factors influencing its sensitivity. Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens were prospectively collected from pediatric inpatients with lower respiratory tract infections at the time of admission in the Shenzhen Children's Hospital from May 2009 to April 2010. Total nucleic acids were extracted using the EZ1 system (Qiagen, Germany) and 17 respiratory viruses and genotypes including influenza A virus (FluA), FluB, parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1), PIV2, PIV3, PIV4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses (RhV), enteroviruses (EnV), human bocaviruses (hBoV), adenoviruses (AdV), four coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1), and FluA 2009 pandemic H1N1(H1N1-p) were detected and identified by the ResPlex II kit. In parallel, 16 real-time TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR assays were used to quantitatively detect each virus except for RhV. Influenza and parainfluenza viral cultures were also performed. Among the total 438 NPS specimens collected during the study period, one or more viral pathogens were detected in 274 (62.6%) and 201(45.9%) specimens by monoplex TaqMan RT-PCR and multiplex ResPlex, respectively. When results from monoplex PCR or cell culture were used as the reference standard, the multiplex PCR possessed specificities of 92.9-100.0%. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR for PIV3, hMPV, PIV1 and BoV were 73.1%, 70%, 66.7% and 55.6%, respectively, while low sensitivities (11.1%-40.0%) were observed for FluA, EnV, OC43, RSV and H1N1. Among the seven viruses/genotypes detected with higher frequencies, multiplex PCR sensitivities were correlated significantly with viral loads determined by the TaqMan RT-PCR in FluA, H1N1-p and RSV (p=0.011-0.000). The Qiagen ResPlex II multiplex RT-PCR kit possesses excellent specificity for simultaneous detection of 17 viral pathogens in NPS specimens in pediatric inpatients at the time of admission. The sensitivity of multiplex RT-PCR was influenced by viral loads, specimen process methods, primer and probe design and amplification condition."

Both methods proved to be valuable tools for histopathology. ISH sometimes recognized cells that did not show typical CMV inclusions. An antiserum against the full spectrum of viral proteins (non-infectious enveloped particles) detected most cytomegalic cells in disseminated and organ-limited infections. An antiserum against a recombinant polypeptide (XP1) was particularly useful in connatal CMV infections and organ-limited infections. We have demonstrated that IHC and ISH studies in parallel are the best approach to the detection of CMV infections in pathological specimens.

Relatively little is known about the role of the T3SS in the pathogenesis of early P. aeruginosa infection in the CF airway. In this longitudinal study, 168 P. aeruginosa isolates from 58 children diagnosed with CF following newborn screening and 47 isolates from homes of families with or without children with CF were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and T3SS genotype and phenotype determined using multiplex PCR and western blotting. Associations were sought between T3SS data and clinical variables and comparisons made between T3SS data of clinical and environmental PFGE genotypes. Seventy-seven of the 92 clinical strains were exoS+ (71% secretors (ExoS+)) and 15 were exoU+ (93% secretors (ExoU+)). Initial exoS+ strains were five times more likely to secrete ExoS than subsequent exoS+ strains at first isolation. The proportion of ExoS+ strains declined with increasing age at acquisition. No associations were found between T3SS characteristics and gender, site of isolation, exacerbation, a persistent strain or pulmonary outcomes. Fourteen of the 23 environmental strains were exoS+ (79% ExoS+) and nine were exoU+ (33% ExoU+). The exoU+ environmental strains were significantly less likely to secrete ExoU than clinical strains. This study provides new insight into the T3SS characteristics of P. aeruginosa isolated from the CF airway early in life."

The hybridization pattern of the PCR positive samples identified clonets 39, 19/20, and 32/33 with frequencies of 0.84, 0.32 and 0.26, respectively. A total of 31 samples corresponded to mixed infections. The most frequently found mixtures were: clonets 39 and 19/20 (14 cases), followed by clonets 39 and 32/33 (8 cases), clonets 39, 32/33 and 19/20 (8 cases), and clonets 32/33 and 19/20 (1 case). Amplified DNA from 9 cases showed no hybridization signal with none of the three studied probes indicating that other genotypes different to the ones mentioned are circulating in humans, but that the clonets used as probes are the most prevalent ones in terms of transmission in the endemic areas studied. A biological characterization of 34 T. cruzi populations isolated from the xenodiagnosis of the patients was performed on an experimental murine model.

We aimed to characterize the clinical and demographic features associated with different RV species detected in children attending hospital with ARI, from low-income families in North-east Brazil. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 630 children <5 years with ARI. Clinical diagnosis and disease severity were also recorded. Samples were analyzed by multiplex PCR for 18 viral and atypical bacterial pathogens; RV positive samples underwent partial sequencing to determine species and type. RV was the fourth commonest pathogen accounting for 18.7% of pathogens detected. RV was commonly detected in children with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma/episodic viral wheeze (EVW). Species and type were assigned in 112 cases (73% RV-A; 27% RV-C; 0% RV-B). Generally, there were no differences in clinical or demographic characteristics between those infected with RV-A and RV-C. However, in children with asthma/EVW, RV-C was detected relatively more frequently than RV-A (23% vs. 5%; P = 0.04). Our findings highlight RV as a potentially important pathogen in this setting. Generally, clinical and demographic features were similar in children in whom RV-A and C species were detected. However, RV-C was more frequently found in children with asthma/EVW than RV-A."

At 23 weeks gestation the mother had experienced primary gingivostomatitis and ""flu-like"" symptoms, which healed without specific treatment. At birth both infants presented disseminated ulcerated skin lesions at the head, trunk and extremities. Soon after birth, the infants required mechanical ventilation and showed multiple organ involvement. On the basis of the mother's positive HSV-1 serology, treatment was established before the Tzanck test, serological findings and polymerase chain reaction of the skin and blood had confirmed the neonatal infection. In spite of the early diagnosis within hours after birth and immediate treatment, the extensive skin involvement associated with rapidly progressing multiorgan failure resulted in death of both infants within 3 days. Although a primary HSV-1 infection during pregnancy is extremely rare, gingivostomatitis with general symptoms can lead to transplacental infection and should therefore be taken seriously. Prompt recognition and treatment in the mother are paramount and might be life-saving for the infants."
CD011926,0,10450434,0,An outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis in an Afghan refugee settlement in north-west Pakistan.,"Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to Leishmania tropica appears to be an emerging disease in parts of north-east Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan. Timargara, an Afghan refugee camp of 17 years' standing, in the district of Dir, North West Frontier Province of Pakistan, experienced a major outbreak of CL in 1997 for the first time. As part of the investigation, each section of the camp was surveyed for CL. Around 38% of the 9200 inhabitants bore active lesions and a further 13% had scars from earlier attacks. According to interview statements, 99% of earlier infections had healed within the previous 2 years. To confirm the diagnosis, a sample of current CL lesions was examined parasitologically. Amastigotes were detectable by microscopy in only 36% of lesions. However, 48% of slide-negative cases produced positive cultures and some cases negative to both microscopy and culture were positive by PCR. Overall detection rate was about 80%. The sandfly Phlebotomus sergenti, a known vector of L. tropica, was captured within the camp, indicating local transmission. CL has not been reported from this area of Pakistan before. Although the majority of refugees left Afghanistan 2 decades ago, cross-border movement of men is common. The Afghanistan capital, Kabul, is currently experiencing a major epidemic of CL; infected migrant carriers from Kabul are probably the source of the outbreak in Timargara."

CD011926,0,26713313,0,The Prevalence of Human Papillomavirus between the Neonates and Their Mothers.,"The impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection on pregnancy is a major problem of medicine. The transmission of the virus from mother to fetus is a process yet unresolved. The immune response and changed hormonal status of pregnant women might facilitate infection. A research on the prevalence of HPV infection was conducted at the Clinic of Obstetrics, Medical University of Lublin (Poland). The studied group included 152 randomly selected women. The material was tested for the presence of HPV DNA by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The aim of the research was to assess the relation between HPV infections detected in the buccal smears of the neonates and the incidence of such infections in the cervical/buccal smears of their mothers. In the group of 152 infants HPV was found in 16 (10.53%). Among the cervical/buccal smears, HPV was isolated, respectively, in 24 (15.79%) and in 19 (12.5%) pregnant women. Statistically significant differences in the prevalence of HPV swabs from the newborns and the cervical/buccal smears of their mothers were found (p < 0.001). The identification of mothers in whose buccal smears HPV was detected can help develop a group of children who run a relatively significant risk of being infected."

CD011926,0,20861334,0,Improved detection of five major gastrointestinal pathogens by use of a molecular screening approach.,"The detection of bacterial and parasitic gastrointestinal pathogens through culture and microscopy is laborious and time-consuming. We evaluated a molecular screening approach (MSA) for the detection of five major enteric pathogens: Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Giardia lamblia, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), and Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), for use in the daily practice of a clinical microbiology laboratory. The MSA consists of prescreening of stool specimens with two real-time multiplex PCR (mPCR) assays, which give results within a single working day, followed by guided culture/microscopy of the positive or mPCR-inhibited samples. In the present 2-year overview, 28,185 stool specimens were included. The MSA was applied to 13,974 stool samples (49.6%), whereas 14,211 samples were tested by conventional methods only (50.4%). The MSA significantly increased the total detection rate compared to that of conventional methods (19.2% versus 6.4%). The detection of all included pathogens, with the exception of S. enterica, significantly improved. MSA detection frequencies were as follows: C. jejuni, 8.1%; G. lamblia, 4.7%; S. enterica, 3.0%; STEC, 1.9%; and Shigella spp./EIEC, 1.4%. The guided culture/microscopy was positive in 76.8%, 58.1%, 88.9%, 16.8%, and 18.1% of mPCR-positive specimens, respectively. Of all mPCRs, only 1.8% was inhibited. Other findings were that detection of mixed infections was increased (0.9% versus 0.02%) and threshold cycle (C(T)) values for MSA guided culture/microscopy-positive samples were significantly lower than those for guided culture/microscopy-negative samples. In conclusion, an MSA for detection of gastrointestinal pathogens resulted in markedly improved detection rates and a substantial decrease in time to reporting of (preliminary) results."

CD011926,0,21328392,0,Emergence of G9 as a predominant genotype of human rotaviruses in Cuba.,"To study human rotaviruses in Cuban children up to 5 years old with acute diarrhea, a total of 64 faecal samples from two pediatric hospitals between 2006 and 2008 were analyzed. Thirty-nine samples (60.9%) were found positive for rotaviruses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), while four (6.2%) exhibited discordant results (ELISA positives/PAGE negatives). All the positive samples were genotyped by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The most prevalent G and P types were G1 (60.5%) and P[8] (90.6%), respectively. Among the rotaviruses detected, two long RNA patterns were identified by PAGE (L/A and L/B). The predominant genotype in 2006 and 2007 was G1/P[8] with detection rates 71.4% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, G9/P[8] was found at the highest rate (78.5%) in 2008. The phylogenetic analysis of VP7 genes of the ten representative strains indicated that Cuban G1/P[8] rotaviruses were close to those reported in the Americas, and G9/P[8] rotaviruses were located in the lineage of the emerging G9 strains spreading worldwide. This is the first molecular epidemiologic study of rotaviruses in Cuba, highlighting the current increase of the G9 rotavirus which has been recognized globally as an emerging genotype. The study reinforces the need for a systematic surveillance of the molecular epidemiology of rotaviruses."
CD011926,0,22728277,0,Comparison of nasopharyngeal flocked swabs and nasopharyngeal wash collection methods for respiratory virus detection in hospitalized children using real-time polymerase chain reaction.,"This paper describes the molecular detection of respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (flocked swabs) and nasopharyngeal washes (washes) in a clinical setting. Washes and flocked swabs collected from children<3 years old hospitalized with a lower respiratory tract infection were tested for parainfluenza virus 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B and metapneumovirus (Group 1) and adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus (Group 2) using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). A consensuses standard was used to determine sensitivity and compare cycle thresholds (C(T)) of washes and flocked swabs for each virus and group of viruses. Sensitivities ranged from 79 to 89% and 69 to 94% for flocked swabs and washes, respectively, excluding AdV which had a sensitivity of 35% for flocked swabs. When the flocked swabs and washes of Group 1 viruses were collected on the day of admission, the sensitivity of both sample types was 100%. Wash specimens had a lower C(T) value and higher sensitivity than flocked swabs; however there was no statistical difference in the sensitivity of a flocked swab (89%) versus wash (93%) for the detection of Group 1 viruses, particularly when samples were collected on the same day. Flocked swabs may be a useful alternative to washes for detection of respiratory viruses in clinical settings."

In April, cases were also reported in Mayotte and Mauritius. On Réunion Island, the first cases were reported at the end of April. Surveillance of this epidemic required an adaptive system, which at first was based on active and retrospective case detection around the cases reported, then relied on a sentinel network when the incidence increased. Emerging and severe forms of infection were investigated. Death certificates were monitored. By April 2006, the surveillance estimate was 244,000 cases of chikungunya virus infection, including 123 severe cases and 41 of maternoneonatal transmission, with an overall attack rate of 35%. Chikungunya infection was mentioned on 203 death certificates and significant mortality was observed.

CD011926,0,18073177,0,New diagnostic tools for neonatal sepsis: the role of a real-time polymerase chain reaction for the early detection and identification of bacterial and fungal species in blood samples.,"Early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal sepsis are essential to prevent severe and life threatening complications. Consequently, rapid diagnostic tests capable to differentiate infected from non-infected newborns have the potential to make a significant impact on neonatal care. A new real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; LightCycler SeptiFast test M GRADE) has been proposed in the routine assessment of neonatal sepsis for the detection and identification of bacterial and fungal DNA from microorganisms which cause approximately 90% of all blood stream infections. The LightCycler SeptiFast test can detect and identify simultaneously the 25 most important bacterial and fungal species causing bloodstream infections within few hours by using a small volume of a single whole blood sample. Real-time PCR can be easily incorporated into the hospital setting for term or near-term infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for sepsis evaluation."
CD011926,0,7614960,0,Diversity of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated in a Canadian hospital.,"Three neonates and three other patients located elsewhere in the hospital became infected with Staphylococcus aureus. Initial automated microdilution susceptibility testing with oxacillin and disk diffusion testing with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid indicated the isolates had borderline oxacillin resistance (MICs 4 micrograms/ml), presumably due to hyperproduction of beta-lactamase. Chromosomal DNA restriction fingerprinting and phage typing revealed the neonatal isolates to be identical; whereas, the other patients were infected with three different strains. Further analysis of the four strains by Southern hybridization with a mecA specific oligoprobe and a quantitative beta-lactamase assay demonstrated that two strains carried the mecA gene (coding for low affinity penicillin-binding protein 2a), and two strains were hyperproducers of beta-lactamase, including one which was mecA gene positive. One strain neither carried the mecA gene nor hyperproduced beta-lactamase. The two mecA gene positive strains displayed oxacillin MICs of 16 micrograms/ml on dilution susceptibility testing in 4% NaCl supplemented Mueller-Hinton agar. Hence, they were considered intrinsically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Both oxacillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid MICs were increased on NaCl supplementation. Results of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid disk diffusion susceptibility testing did not correlate with quantitative beta-lactamase production. It is recommended that clinical laboratories do not use amoxicillin-clavulanic acid disk diffusion assays to differentiate suspected borderline resistance due to beta-lactamase hyperproduction from mecA gene expression of PBP-2a since additional mechanisms may account for resistance."

CD011926,0,15484263,0,Evidence of rotavirus AU32 like G9 strains from nontypeable fecal specimens of Indian children hospitalized during 1993-1994.,"Serotyping of 432 rotavirus positive fecal specimens collected from hospitalized children during 1990-1997 was carried out at National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, India, using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against VP7 determinant of serotypes G1-G4, G6, G8, and G10. However, significant number of specimens, that is, 47.92% remained nontypeable. The aim of the present study was to culture adapt the nontypeable specimens and to characterize them further. Since the fecal specimens were not tested by MAb to G9 serotype, which has emerged as an important serotype infecting humans recently, presence of G9 serotype was expected in nontypeable specimens. Therefore, we selected specimens from those children, who showed higher neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer in their convalescent serum samples to G9 serotype than their mothers. Out of six isolates having long electropherotype, five isolates showed subgroup II, and one showed subgroup I, II. The isolates were confirmed as G9 by MAb based ELISA, neutralization assay, and PCR. The G9 specific nested PCR products of four isolates showed 96-99% identities to AU32 G9 strain reported from Japan. P type of four isolates was determined as P8. Besides isolates, four additional nontypeable fecal specimens were confirmed as G9 by MAb based ELISA. Thus, 10 (28.57%) out of 35 nontypeable specimens were identified as rotavirus serotype G9. The results indicate that serotype G9 may represent significant proportion of specimens, which were previously nontypeable."
CD011926,0,21121043,0,Human microbiome visualization using 3D technology.,High-throughput sequencing technology has opened the door to the study of the human microbiome and its relationship with health and disease. This is both an opportunity and a significant biocomputing challenge. We present here a 3D visualization methodology and freely-available software package for facilitating the exploration and analysis of high-dimensional human microbiome data. Our visualization approach harnesses the power of commercial video game development engines to provide an interactive medium in the form of a 3D heat map for exploration of microbial species and their relative abundance in different patients. The advantage of this approach is that the third dimension provides additional layers of information that cannot be visualized using a traditional 2D heat map. We demonstrate the usefulness of this visualization approach using microbiome data collected from a sample of premature babies with and without sepsis.
CD011926,0,9111480,0,Blood collection on filter paper: a practical approach to sample collection for studies of perinatal HIV transmission.,"The use of dried blood spots lends itself to widespread application in large field studies, especially in remote areas. We present experience gained during a perinatal HIV transmission study in southern Africa in which dried blood spot samples were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. In this study, 15,810 filter paper cards with dried blood spots were collected. Infants were seen at age 6 and 12 weeks, and PCR was routinely done in duplicate on each sample. Of 186 negative controls (infants born to HIV-negative women), two (1.1%) had a single strongly reactive PCR result; the repeated duplicates were both negative. In contrast, all 24 known positive samples were strongly positive in both tests. Results were available from 1,976 duplicate tests on 1,235 infants born to HIV-infected women. Based on the PCR result on a later sample, the positive predictive value was 97.6% if both replicates were strongly positive (absorbance: 0.8 OD450 U), 100% when one of the replicates was strongly positive, and 27% when one or both replicates were weakly positive (but none strongly positive). When both replicates were negative, the negative predictive value was > or = 96.2%. Thus, when a single HIV PCR test has a strongly positive result, the infant is very likely to be infected. A positive PCR result after age 1 month was 98.9% accurate in predicting antibody positivity after 15 months. Suggestions for sample collection, storage, and PCR testing are provided."

CD011926,0,10655388,0,Specificity and sensitivity of high levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies against pertussis toxin in a single serum sample for diagnosis of infection with Bordetella pertussis.,"Laboratory confirmation of pertussis by culture, PCR, or detection of antibody increase in paired sera is hampered by low sensitivity in the later stages of the disease. Therefore, we investigated whether, and at which level, concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against pertussis toxin (PT), IgG-PT, in a single serum sample are indicative of active or recent pertussis. IgG-PT, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in units per milliliter, was analyzed in 7,756 sera collected in a population-based study in The Netherlands, in the sera of 3,491 patients with at least a fourfold increase of IgG-PT, in paired sera of 89 patients with positive cultures and/or PCR results, and in the sera of 57 patients with clinically documented pertussis with a median follow-up of 1.4 years. We conclude that, independently of age, IgG-PT levels of at least 100 U/ml are diagnostic of recent or active infection with Bordetella pertussis. Such levels are present in less than 1% of the population and are reached in most pertussis patients within 4 weeks after disease onset and persist only temporarily."

This pathogen has been associated with out-breaks of a rare form of infant meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bacteremia and neonate deaths. The organism is ranked by the International Commission for Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) as a 'Severe hazard for restricted populations, life threatening or substantial chronic sequelae or long duration'. Present study aimed to isolate Cronobacter spp. from PIF and clinical samples, such as blood, stool and CSF collected from 93 neonates and child patients, age ranged from 0 to 24months. We did not detect Cronobacter spp. in any of these samples. Later 32 PIF samples collected from retail markets in Bangladesh were tested for the presence of Cronobacter spp. Of these only one was found to be contaminated with Cronobacter sp. This is the first case of Cronobacter contaminated PIF found in Bangladesh to be reported. The organism was successfully identified based on its typical culture characteristics, producing blue-green colonies on chromogenic DFI agar and also by a standardized conventional PCR assay targeting the alpha glucosidase and 16S rRNA gene sequence of Cronobacter sp. The 16S rRNA gene was partially sequenced to provide for the phylogenetic analysis of this isolate (DA01) and found to cluster with some other Cronobacter isolates in the phylogram."

The clinical courses of two brothers with autosomal dominant ALPS who were infected with CMV in the neonatal period are described. CMV was detected from throat and urine culture from the brothers. ALPS was confirmed by in vitro anti-CD95 MoAb-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis assay and subsequent sequencing and identification of mutations in the Fas gene. A de novo mutation in the Fas gene, leading to a truncated cytoplasmic Fas product, was associated with autosomal dominant ALPS in a mother and her two sons. Both boys had evidence of CMV infection acquired early in infancy which cleared by the age of 2-3 years. There were no neurodevelopmental sequelae. The natural history of CMV infection in two infants with ALPS was similar to that described in normal children."

We recently experienced a male infant with HLH and ALF induced by HSV type 1 (HSV-1). The infant, born at 39 weeks of gestation by normal delivery, developed a fever on day 4. On day 9, laboratory investigations showed progressive liver dysfunction and coagulopathy, and the serum ferritin was excessively elevated. Furthermore, the blood levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and interferon-gamma were also elevated. HSV-1 DNA was detected in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid by the real-time PCR method. A diagnosis of HLH was established based upon the following criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia (two cell lines), serum ferritin (> 500 mug/l) and hypofibrinogenemia (< 150 mg/dl). High-dose acyclovir therapy, steroid pulse therapy using methylprednisolone, high-dose gamma globulin therapy and a blood transfusion were given. The patient recovered without neurological deficit. Neonatal disseminated HSV infections may be complicated by the development of HLH and hypercyokinemia. If HLH is suspected, not only high-dose acyclovir therapy but also anti-cytokine therapy should be considered."

In total, 32 isolates of MRKP, comprising 23 clinical isolates and nine surveillance isolates, were recovered during this period and analysed for epidemiological relatedness. The isolates were compared with 17 other isolates of MRKP that were recovered during 1995. Macrorestriction profiles of total genomic DNA following XbaI restriction endonuclease digestion were analysed by PFGE; this typing classified 56% of the 32 isolates recovered in 1996 into two major clusters. Cluster A included ten isolates from 1996 and three isolates recovered in 1995, whereas cluster B included eight isolates from the outbreak of 1996. The remaining isolates were genetically unrelated to those of clusters A and B; they constituted sporadic strains. The two major clusters were also evident using other molecular typing methods, such as random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR, where isolates of clusters A and B could be identified on the basis of their discriminative patterns. This investigation showed the predominance of two epidemic strains, and illustrated the ease with which MRKP strains can disseminate and persist within a single ward."
CD011926,0,25165085,0,DNA microarray-based typing of Streptococcus agalactiae isolates.,"Streptococcus agalactiae frequently colonizes the urogenital tract, and it is a major cause of bacterial septicemia, meningitis, and pneumonia in newborns. For typing purposes, a microarray targeting group B streptococcus (GBS) virulence-associated markers and resistance genes was designed and validated with reference strains, as well as clinical and veterinary isolates. Selected isolates were also subjected to multilocus sequence typing. It was observed that putative typing markers, such as alleles of the alpha-like protein or capsule types, vary independently of each other, and they also vary independently from the affiliation to their multilocus sequence typing (MLST)-defined sequence types. Thus, it is not possible to assign isolates to sequence types based on the identification of a single distinct marker, such as a capsule type or alp allele. This suggests the occurrence of frequent genomic recombination. For array-based typing, a set of 11 markers (bac, alp, pil1 locus, pepS8, fbsB, capsule locus, hylB, abiG-I/-II plus Q8DZ34, pil2 locus, nss plus srr plus rogB2, and rgfC/A/D/B) was defined that provides a framework for splitting the tested 448 S. agalactiae isolates into 76 strains that clustered mainly according to MLST-defined clonal complexes. There was evidence for region- and host-specific differences in the population structure of S. agalactiae, as well as an overrepresentation of strains related to sequence type 17 among the invasive isolates. The arrays and typing scheme described here proved to be a convenient tool for genotyping large numbers of clinical/veterinary isolates and thus might help obtain insight into the epidemiology of S. agalactiae."
CD011926,0,12782677,0,Mature CD8(+) T lymphocyte response to viral infection during fetal life.,"Immunization of newborns against viral infections may be hampered by ineffective CD8(+) T cell responses. To characterize the function of CD8(+) T lymphocytes in early life, we studied newborns with congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. We demonstrate that HCMV infection in utero leads to the expansion and the differentiation of mature HCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells, which have similar characteristics to those detected in adults. High frequencies of HCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected by ex vivo tetramer staining as early as after 28 weeks of gestation. During the acute phase of infection, these cells had an early differentiation phenotype (CD28(-)CD27(+)CD45RO(+), perforin(low)), and they acquired a late differentiation phenotype (CD28(-)CD27(-)CD45RA(+), perforin(high)) during the course of the infection. The differentiated cells showed potent perforin-dependent cytolytic activity and produced antiviral cytokines. The finding of a mature and functional CD8(+) T cell response to HCMV suggests that the machinery required to prime such responses is in place during fetal life and could be used to immunize newborns against viral pathogens."
CD011926,0,9579613,0,Diagnosis of perinatal HIV-1 infection by in-house PCR.,"A study on how to apply PCR as a diagnostic test for the infants born to HIV-1 infected mothers is described. All steps including clinical care, blood sampling, specimen processing and PCR analysis were carried out using native facilities and personnel. An open cohort of 130 children was evaluated at birth, 1, 6, 9, 15, and 18 months of age. Definite infection status was assessed by clinical and serological data during an 18 months of follow up period. PCR results were reported as positive or negative when at least 2 concordant data were denoted. This in-house PCR, compared to known infection status, gave 100% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity within 6 months after birth. On the other hand, clinical diagnosis could identify only the infected infants at 9 months of age. The HIV-1 transmission rate from mother to infant was 23.2%. Though this PCR was not at an optimal level of specificity, it was still beneficial to identify uninfected infants in the first year of their lives and avoid unnecessary medical care. Here, we report an in-house PCR that offers good performance at low cost for the diagnosis of HIV-1 vertical transmission."
CD011926,0,9260689,0,Suppressive effects of human herpesvirus 6 on in vitro colony formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.,"Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) has been reported to be involved in bone marrow failure after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). To elucidate the role of HHV-6 in the marrow failure, we examined the comparative effect of two variants of HHV-6 (HHV-6A and HHV-6B) and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) on in vitro colony formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in methylcellulose semi-solid media. Progenitor cells prepared from cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMNCs) were infected with one of these viruses at various multiplicity of infection (MOI), and were subjected to methylcellulose colony assay. Formation of both granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) colonies was MOI-dependently suppressed after infection with the Z29 strain of HHV-6B. Although HHV-6A suppressed the formation of BFU-E colonies as efficiently as HHV-6B, the former did not exhibit significant suppressive effect on the formation of CFU-GM colonies at an MOI 1. HHV-7 had no effect on hematopoietic colony formation at all. Based on frequent positivity of viral DNA in single colonies obtained from HHV-6-infected progenitor cells by polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, direct effects of HHV-6 on the hematopoietic progenitor cells are suggested as the cause of the suppression rather than indirect effects via accessory cells of the bone marrow."
CD011926,0,10670571,0,"Distribution and expression of bca, the gene encoding the c alpha protein, by Streptococcus agalactiae.","A total of 52 clinical isolates of group B streptococci (GBS) was tested for expression of the c protein c(alpha) by a fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and by PCR amplification of a 202-bp stretch within the repeat unit of the bca gene encoding the c(alpha) protein. The strains were categorised as follows: c(alpha) FAT positive and PCR positive with amplification products of multiple sizes (category A, n = 12); FAT negative and with PCR products of multiple sizes (category B, n = 11); FAT negative and with a single PCR product of c. 200 bp (category C, n = 5); negative in both tests (category D, n = 24). A single amplification product of minimum size and additional products of larger sizes corresponded to one and more bca repeats, respectively. Five of the 11 category B strains showed expression of low Mr c(alpha) in whole cell-based Western blotting. The results showed that a proportion of the GBS isolates harboured bca gene elements that either were not expressed or they expressed c(alpha) molecular variants which could not be detected by the whole cell-based FAT. This genotype/phenotype discrepancy should be considered in relation to GBS typing, including the selection of antibody reagents and the technical approach to c(alpha) protein detection."
CD011926,0,19177758,0,[Diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases in pediatrics].,"Sexually transmitted diseases(STD) among children includes the following three infections; vertical transmissions from infected mothers to newborns and infants, infections among adolescents, and infections in victims of sexual abuse. Detection of STD organisms from children suggests presence of sexual abuse. Diagnostic procedure of STD among children needs to be less invasive. Antigen detection tests and PCR methods for some STD organisms may show false positive results. Normal flora of genital organs of children should also be noticed for diagnosis of STD. Vertical infections of STD organisms cause a variety of symptoms to infected children. Diagnosis of infections in children using commercially available reagents should be cautious. Flora of respiratory tracts and transplacental antibody may affect the results."
CD011926,0,1956745,0,"A prospective study of infants of human immunodeficiency virus seropositive and seronegative women with a history of intravenous drug use or of intravenous drug-using sex partners, in the Bronx, New York City.","A prospective study was conducted in the Bronx, New York, of 70 infants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (n = 33) and uninfected (n = 37) mothers who had a history of intravenous drug use or of intravenous drug-using sex partners. Infants were observed from birth to a median age of 23 months (range 3 to 54 months). HIV infection was confirmed in seven infants (21%) of seropositive mothers; six developed HIV disease, with symptoms observed in the first year. Of these, three died (3, 9, and 36 months) of HIV-related causes; 3 of 4 survivors were greater than 25 months of age. HIV symptoms preceded or were concurrent with abnormalities in T-lymphocyte subsets; postneonatal polymerase chain reaction confirmed HIV infection in five infants with symptoms and one without symptoms. Among infants of seropositive mothers, seven without laboratory evidence of HIV (including polymerase chain reaction) had findings suggestive of HIV infection, including persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, oral candidiasis, parotitis, and inverted T-lymphocyte ratios. These findings were not observed in infants of seronegative mothers. Although the presence of HIV proviral sequences was associated with HIV disease, the observation of indeterminate symptoms in at-risk infants indicates the importance of long-term clinical follow-up to exclude HIV infection. Disease manifestations in comparable infants of seronegative mothers are important for assessment of the impact of maternal drug use, development of specific clinical criteria for early diagnosis of HIV and eligibility for antiretroviral therapy."
CD011926,0,1336795,0,PCR-mediated search for herpes simplex virus DNA in sections of brain from patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders.,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been shown to cause central nervous system demyelination in experimental animals and several studies have implicated HSV in the aetiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). We have used the polymerase chain reaction to look for DNA of both type 1 HSV (HSV-1) and type 2 HSV (HSV-2) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded brain tissues from patients with MS and other neurological diseases. Primers which amplify a fragment of the normal cellular gene c-myc were included in the reactions to assess the preservation of DNA in the tissue samples. 77 plaques of demyelination from 23 patients with MS were examined. HSV-1 DNA was amplified from only one plaque. This plaque involved the trigeminal root entry zone in the pons and it is suggested that the presence of viral DNA was related to the site examined rather than to the demyelination per se. HSV-2 DNA was amplified from none of the plaques. As expected, HSV-1 DNA was detected in the brains of 6 patients who died of HSV-1 encephalitis and HSV-2 DNA was amplified from the brain of a neonate with congenital HSV-2 infection. In sections of brain from 39 patients with a wide range of other neurological diseases HSV-1 DNA was detected in the pons of only 1 patient, who had AIDS associated with cytomegalovirus ventriculitis; subsequent investigation confirmed the presence of concomitant HSV-1 brain stem infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011926,0,8383073,0,Congenital diffuse necrotizing herpetic retinitis.,"Neonatal Herpes simplex infections are usually contracted from the birth canal, and the systemic lesions develop several days to weeks after delivery. We present the clinicopathologic findings in a newborn with a prenatal diagnosis of hydrocephalus who died at 1 day of age. Severe liquefaction necrosis and foci of calcification were present in the brain, adrenal glands, and retina. Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions were present in the adrenal glands and retina. There was no clinical evidence of genital herpes in either parent. This is the first documented case of in utero transmission of Herpes simplex infection, confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction, and causing fulminant necrotizing retinitis and encephalitis."
CD011926,0,24261263,0,[Virological tests in diagnostic management of sudden unexpected deaths in children].,"Based on the present knowledge, the review paper attempts to answer the general question whether virological tests are justified in cases of sudden deaths in children. In particular, the question addresses their importance in establishing the cause of death. The authors also attempt to answer additional questions, namely: (1) whether histopathology provides an adequate basis for establishing the cause of death, (2) whether extending histological evaluation to exclude immunohistochemistry is warranted, and (3) whether there is a correlation between detection of a virus and ""intensity"" of inflammatory infiltration detected by histology. At the same time, the present paper is an introduction to discussing the results of research in the above field carried out by the authors. In cases of sudden deaths of chil- dren, numerous investigators point to a viral infection as a significant etiopathogenic factor. Nevertheless, no uniform strategy has been developed to date in post-mortem diagnostic management in this field. This is also true with respect to answering what viruses should be isolated and by what techniques when sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and/or sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) are suspected. The review of the literature on the subject allows for stating that virological tests are not justified in all cases of SIDS/SUDI, the more so that these tests are not commonly available and inexpensive. Detection of a virus rarely allows for determining the cause of death, demonstrating only the presence of the virus in the tested material. On numerous occasions, demonstrating the presence of a virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has not been in any way reflected in basic and extended histology. In the opinion of the authors, in cases of SIDS/SUDI suspicion, while determining the cause of death, primarily basic histological tests are recommended, as they are the most valuable screening tests. In justified cases basic tests should be extended to include additional immunohistochemical tests, and in exceptional cases--PCR to isolate a virus. PCR may be performed both in frozen and in formalin/paraffin fixed material."

Primary infection is often asymptomatic and leads to life-long latency. Reactivation may induce different organ manifestations, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression. Histopathologically, the virus can be detected by light microscopy. Different cell populations in different organs are transformed into""owl's eye"" cells, which are pathognomonic. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy can be applied as complementary methods. Various PCR approaches in molecular pathology including nested PCR, capture probe ELISA-PCR and real time PCR confer HCMV tests high sensitivity and specificity.

CD011926,0,16258155,1,Real-time polymerase chain reaction for detecting bacterial DNA directly from blood of neonates being evaluated for sepsis.,"Speed is of the essence when evaluating an infant with symptoms consistent with sepsis. Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal sepsis, infants receive multiple, broad-spectrum antibiotics before receiving finalized blood culture results. Incorporating an additional, reliable, yet rapid assay to detect bacteria directly from blood would facilitate timely diagnosis and appropriate care. To this end, we designed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting the highly conserved 380 bases of 16S rDNA. DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples using a Qiagen column. The limit of detection for the TaqMan-based assay, using a Smartcycler instrument, was 40, 50, or 2000 colony-forming units per milliliter of blood (CFU/ml) of Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively, when white blood cell counts were below 39,000/microl. Implementing this approach requires less than 4 hours for both sample preparation and real-time PCR compared with 1 to 2 days to detect growth in culture or 5 days to finalize no-growth culture results. There was an overall agreement between the results of culture and real-time PCR of 94.1% (80 of 85) in this study. These results suggest that molecular techniques can augment culture-based methods for diagnosing neonatal sepsis, especially in infants whose mothers have received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis."
CD011926,0,9656387,0,Maternal and viral factors in vertical transmission of HIV-1 subtype E.,"Vertical transmission of HIV-1 is caused by multifactorial factors. To access the relationship of viral factors involving in perinatal transmission of HIV-1 subtype E, which is the predominant type in Thailand, plasma viral load, blood CD4+ lymphocyte level, heteroduplex mobility, and V3 sequence of the HIV-1 envelope gene were studied in 32 transmitting and 25 non-transmitting mothers. We found that HIV-1 subtype E vertical transmission was strongly associated with high maternal plasma viral RNA (> 4 x 10(4) copies/ml) and high genetic diversity of envelope gene determined by heteroduplex mobility (< 0.9). The variation of nucleotide sequences in envelope gene of subtype E vertical transmission could not determine in V3 region. Hence, plasma viral load and heteroduplex mobility can be used as prediction factors in vertical transmission of HIV-1 subtype E."

No doubt, early and proper diagnosis of infection pregnant women or her baby pave the way to effective treatment and minimize complications. In this study; the PCR and ELISA-IgM were used to diagnose active toxoplasmosis. The results revealed that PCR detected very recently infection (23/70 subjects) than ELISA-IgM (18/70 ones). However, the use of both ELISA-IgM and PCR together improved the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity."
CD011926,0,19398129,0,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia following severe congenital neutropenia or de novo ALL?,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) presenting with neutropenia alone is very rare. We describe a newborn with an early life-threatening infection, severe neutropenia and bone marrow findings compatible with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). She was treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with complete neutrophil recovery. Three months later she developed a pro-B ALL. We identified a rare loss of 5'-MLL present at the diagnosis of SCN and ALL by FISH analysis using two different MLL (11q23) probes. Molecular analyses for SCN causing mutations (ELA-2, HAX-1 and G6PC3) and for somatic mutations of the CSF3R gene were negative. The early presence of 5'-MLL loss in bone marrow samples may favor the diagnosis of de novo ALL. Nevertheless, the genetic background for SCN is heterogeneous and a non-described mutation for SCN followed by a secondary ALL cannot be excluded. Further genetic investigation may be useful to gain insight into this rare condition in children."

The index patient was from the neonatal intensive care unit, and the older patients were from other pediatric wards. Cultures were obtained from the environment and from health care workers' hands as part of an outbreak investigation. C meningosepticum was isolated from hand cultures obtained from a senior resident and from environmental cultures obtained from powdered infant formula, an electrical button, a computer keyboard, phone, a doorknob, and an Ambu bag. Antibiogram typing and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence polymerase chain reaction indicated that all of the isolates were epidemiologically related. Nine patients improved on antimicrobial treatment, and 4 premature infants died after the infection. C meningosepticum is a well-known etiologic agent for nosocomial infections involving newborns and immunocompromised patients. Wet and dry environmental surfaces and equipment may act as a source or play a role in disseminating the microorganism. Outbreaks may be controlled with strong emphasis on infection control measures."

IEmRNA was detected in 100%, 75%, 36.3%, 22.2%, and 0% of samples collected 1, 2, 3, 4-6, and >6 months after onset of primary HCMV infection, respectively, showing 83.7% sensitivity and 92.2% specificity, compared with results of quantitative DNAemia (detection of viral DNA in blood). In infected newborns, IEmRNA was positive in 100% of samples collected 1-7 days (median, 1.5 days) and in 46.4% of samples collected 27-260 days (median, 88 days) after birth, showing 75.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity, compared with DNAemia results. IEmRNA was not detected in HCMV-immune individuals with remote or recurrent HCMV infection or in uninfected newborns.

The criteria for the cases were either fetal or neonatal death (11 cases with autopsy material available in 8 cases) or idiopathic severe respiratory distress or central nervous system-related symptoms at birth (49 cases). Controls included 11 placentas from births with no morbidity and 6 placentas that were associated with severe neonatal morbidity of known etiology (trisomy, ruptured uterus, prolapsed cord). The 77 placental tissues were analyzed with a consensus bacterial probe and for a wide variety of viral infections. An infectious cause was found in 46/60 (76%) of cases; these were distributed as follows: enterovirus, 23 cases (22 were coxsackie virus); bacterial (consensus probe), 15 cases; cytomegalovirus (CMV), 4 cases; herpes simplex virus (HSV), 2 cases; parvovirus, 2 cases. The infectious agents localized primarily to Hofbauer cells and trophoblasts. In each of the 8 cases for which autopsy material was available, the same infectious agent that was detected in the placenta was also detected in the autopsy material (spleen, heart, central nervous system, or lungs). No infectious agent was detected in any of the 17 controls. Viral inclusions (only evident for DNA viruses) and stem vessel vasculitis were the 2 histologic findings that were associated with infectious disease in the placenta (P = 0.025). These data show that infection of the villi is highly associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality and that the histologic findings are, in most cases, nonspecific for infection."
CD011926,0,11176273,0,Early detection of reverse transcriptase activity in plasma of neonates infected with HIV-1: a comparative analysis with RNA-based and DNA-based testing using polymerase chain reaction.,"Plasma viral load from 71 HIV-1-infected neonates was measured by using Amp-RT, an ultrasensitive quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT) assay and by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), an RNA-based quantitative assay. Results were then compared with those obtained from detection of proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Turnbull analysis. At 5 days of life, 50% of neonates were positive by Amp-RT, 30% were NASBA positive, and 20% were DNA-PCR positive. Through the first 12 days of life, Amp-RT was more sensitive than either NASBA or DNA-PCR in detecting HIV-1 infection. Amp-RT values correlated well with NASBA RNA values, with an overall Pearson's r = 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.78). In proportional hazards analysis of infants aged 14 to 61 days (N = 31), a one-log increase in RNA-based viral load was associated with a > fivefold risk of disease progression when using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clinical Category C (CDC-C) or death as an endpoint (p =.014). Kaplan-Meier analysis of these data found that RNA viral loads were able to predict disease progression using CDC-C/death as an endpoint (p = .013). Early quantitative viral load measurements may assist clinicians in diagnosing HIV-1 infection, stratifying risk of disease progression, and implementing a treatment plan using highly active antiretroviral therapy for infants within the first few weeks of life."

The HSV DNA was amplified and typed by using primers specific for the DNA polymerase gene of HSV types 1 and 2. Herpes simplex virus DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 3 of 4 neonates with CNS involvement (all with HSV type 2) and 3 of the 4 patients with proved HSE (all with HSV type 1). No HSV DNA was detected in the 4 neonates without CNS disease, the 1 patient with presumed HSE, the 6 patients who had HSE excluded from the diagnosis, and the 105 control patients. Overall, HSV PCR had a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 98%. These results indicate that PCR is a useful noninvasive test in establishing the diagnosis of acute HSE, but a negative result did not exclude the diagnosis."

Rotavirus was detected as the aetiologic agent in 35 (32%) of these patients. The electrophoretic pattern of ds-RNA extracted from the rotaviruses showed 11 different migration patterns (six short and five long), as well as some short and long mixed profiles. All four major G serotypes were identified by amplification of a segment of the gene for VP7 using the polymerase chain reaction. A specific serotype could be assigned in 32 (91%) cases. Serotypes G1-G4 accounted for 11%, 37%, 11%, and 23% of isolates respectively. Three (9%) mixed serotypes were identified by this method and were found to be mixtures of serotypes G1 and G4, G2 and G4, and G3 and G4."
CD011926,0,21926891,0,Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis in children: diagnosis and treatment.,"Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is a pediatric stroke syndrome that occurs uncommonly in association with a number of common pediatric problems, most notably dehydration and infection-otitis media in older children, in particular. Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis involves considerable risk of morbidity and mortality. In the pediatric population, neonates are most commonly affected, but no age group is spared. The clinical manifestations of CSVT vary across age groups and include headache, nausea/vomiting, diplopia, seizures, altered mental status, cranial nerve palsies, and papilledema. Neuroimaging is critical to establishing the diagnosis, and although a variety of modalities are available, the diagnosis is most convincingly made via magnetic resonance imaging with venographic sequencing. Management of CSVT combines medical and surgical approaches and should occur in a multidisciplinary pediatric hospital setting. Anticoagulation is a controversial but generally recommended element of CSVT treatment. Prognosis is related to the extent of vessel and brain parenchymal involvement as well to timeliness of diagnosis and institution of therapy. Long-term follow-up should involve pediatric neurology and ophthalmology and, whenever indicated, rehabilitational therapy as well."

In a cross-sectional study, the mean HIV DNA copy number in 19 symptomatic children was significantly higher than in 31 infected, asymptomatic children (420 +/- 125 vs. 87 +/- 78; P < .0001). In a second group of 8 vertically infected infants followed prospectively from birth, 4 defined as infected in utero showed a more rapid increase in virus load, an accelerated loss of CD4 cells, and early progression to symptomatic disease (3-12 weeks) compared with 4 children with late in utero or intrapartum transmission (10-31 months). These data suggest that a direct relationship exists between HIV replication, the timing of transmission and onset and progression of HIV disease in vertically infected children."

Between 2002-2004, 434 HIV-positive mothers and their infants were recruited and followed up from delivery to 15 months. Infant blood specimens were collected for HIV testing at these time points. The majority of the patients (78%) received single dose nevirapine. The overall HIV transmission rate was 21.8% (17.8-25.8). Receiving single dose nevirapine was protective against HIV vertical transmission although statistically insignificant (relative risk: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.49-1.19). Breastfeeding was not found to be associated with HIV vertical transmission (P = 0.612). In this resource-limited setting, HIV transmission rates are high. Efforts to use more efficacious regimens to arrest HIV vertical transmission are required."
CD011926,0,10675403,0,Suppressive effects of human herpesvirus-6 on thrombopoietin-inducible megakaryocytic colony formation in vitro.,"Two clinical observations, the association of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) with delayed engraftment after stem cell transplantation and thrombocytopenia concomitant with exanthema subitum, prompted us to evaluate the suppressive effects of HHV-6 on thrombopoiesis in vitro. Different culture conditions for thrombopoietin (TPO)-inducible colonies in semi-solid matrices were examined. Using cord blood mononuclear cells as the source of haematopoietic progenitors, two types of colonies, megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) and non-CFU-Meg colonies, were established. The former colonies were identified by the presence of cells with translucent cytoplasm and highly refractile cell membrane, most of which were positive for the CD41 antigen. Although the plating efficiency of both types was much higher under serum-containing conditions than under serum-free conditions, the proportion of CFU-Meg to non-CFU-Meg colonies was consistently higher under serum-free conditions. The plating efficiency of CFU-Meg colonies was doubled by adding stem cell factor to the serum-free matrix. The effects of two variants of HHV-6 (HHV-6A and 6B) and human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7) on TPO-inducible colonies were then compared. HHV-6B inhibited both CFU-Meg and non-CFU-Meg colony formation under serum-free and serum-containing conditions. HHV-6A had similar inhibitory effects. In contrast, HHV-7 had no effect on TPO-inducible colony formation. Heat-inactivation and ultra-filtration of the virus sample completely abolished the suppressive effect. After infection of CD34(+) cells with HHV-6, the viral genome was consistently detected by in situ hybridization. These data suggest that the direct effect of HHV-6 on haematopoietic progenitors is one of the major causes of the suppression of thrombopoiesis."

CD011926,0,7790455,0,Identification and ribotypes of Staphylococcus caprae isolates isolated as human pathogens and from goat milk.,"We report five cases of human infection with Staphylococcus caprae. Two were community acquired (one case each of endocarditis and urinary tract infection); the other three were acquired in a hospital (two cases of bacteremia associated with intravenous access and one case of urinary tract infection). Analysis of human isolates and goat isolates from eight herds showed that they could be misidentified by some commercial identification systems but were clearly identified as S. caprae by ribotyping, according to their species-specific ribotype. Phylogenetic methods applied to the ribotypes did not reveal two distinct lineages corresponding to the goat and human origins of the isolates, although human ribotypes were clearly distinguishable by the presence of a core of four specific bands. The latter observation may reflect some degree of evolutionary change within the species between human and goat isolates."
CD011926,0,18819445,0,[Studies on the possible application of molecular methods in diagnosing carriers and in similarity analysis of group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae)].,"The most popular method of GBS identification in Poland currently is by culturing on enriched agar and verifying the Lancefield Group using special latex agglutination kits. However, the classical methods are time-consuming and their sensitivity is insufficient therefore it is becoming more common to try and apply molecular methods which are characterized by high sensitivity and rapid results. Moreover, molecular methods give us the possibility to carry out epidemiological investigations and gene detection, for instance for antibiotic resistance. It was confirmed that PCR and FISH procedures may be effective in rapid detection of GBS. Thanks to RAPD methods we showed that newborns born to colonized mothers were colonized by GBS strains which originated from the mother, irrespective of the way and the course of labour. Additionally, we detected GBS colonization in children who were born to mothers who were not colonized by GBS. These children were probably colonized with strains coming from hospital environment. More studies are needed to elucidate the route of transmission and the role of colonization of the medical staff. Using multiplex PCR we showed the presence of ermA, ermB and ermC genes in phenotypically confirmed MLS, GBS strains."

CD011926,0,17642538,0,Isolation and drug-resistant patterns of Campylobacter strains cultured from diarrheic children in Tehran.,"To detect campylobacteriosis and determine the drug susceptibility of causative organisms, we acquired 500 diarrheic samples in Cary-Blair transfer medium from two pediatric hospitals in Tehran between October 2004 and October 2005. The samples were also enriched in Preston broth (with supplements) and defibrinated sheep blood (7%). They were plated from both media on Brucella agar containing antibiotics and blood. Isolates were identified through biochemical tests and by the polymerase chain reaction method. Drug susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. In total, 40 Campylobacter strains were isolated (8%). C. jejuni was the dominant species (85.8%) followed by C. coli (14.2%). The rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents were as follows: ciprofloxacin (61.7%), ceftazidime (47%), carbenicillin (35%), tetracycline (20.5%), cefotaxime (14.7%), ampicillin (11.7%), neomycin erythromycin and chloramphenicol (2.9%), gentamicin, streptomycin, imipenem and colistin (0.0%). Campylobacter is an important cause of diarrhea among Iranian children. The detection of Campylobacter increases by 25% if samples are treated in enrichment broth prior to plating. The high rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin is alarming, and further investigation into the possible reasons for this is imperative."
CD011926,0,25274412,0,Molecular analysis of pbp2b in Streptococcus pneumonia isolated from clinical and normal flora samples.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important bacterial pathogen responsible for respiratory infections, bacteraemia, and meningitis remains an important cause of disease and mortality in infants and younger children around the world, with penicillin being considered the drug of choice for the treatment of infections. However, penicillin-resistant S. pneumonia is now becoming endemic worldwide. In this study, a total of 80 pneumococcal isolates were collected from different clinical sources as well as normal flora. These isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and MIC determination. The penicillin-binding proteins, pbp2b, were amplified by PCR, and they were sequenced. The genetic relationship of the penicillin-resistant isolates was performed by BOX PCR. Overall, 36 pneumococcal (45 %) isolates were found to be resistant to penicillin with different MICs. The majority of them (80 %) were intermediately resistant with MIC of 0.12-1 µg/ml, whereas 20 % of isolates were penicillin resistant with MICs of >2 µg/ml. The results identified seven groups which were based on the amino acid substitutions of pbp2b. Sequencing analysis revealed that the most prevalent mutation was the substitution of Adenine for Thymine at the position 445 which is next to the second PBP2b-conserved motif (SSN). This study indicates that resistance to penicillin appears to be dependent on specific mutations in pbp2b, and the substitution in S620 → T near to the third PBP2b-conserved motif appears to be important in developing highly antibiotic-resistant isolates. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the mutations in pbp2b gene and MIC."

The French Pediatric HIV Infection Study Group.,"The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of detection of HIV-1 RNA in plasma of neonates born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and to determine the diagnostic value of this method in the neonatal period. The study involved 96 infants among those enrolled in the French National Prospective Study. HIV-1 RNA was detected in the first 10 days of life by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) in 12 of 48 plasma samples of infected infants and in 39 of 39 of the second samples taken before the age of 3 months. On the same samples, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or viral culture that had been routinely performed were found to be positive in 11 of 48 samples taken in the first 10 days of life and 39 of 39 second samples. For the noninfected infants, HIV-1 RNA was never detected in the 48 samples taken in the first 10 days of life and was detected in one of the 48 samples taken before the age of 3 months. HIV-1 RNA detection in plasma by NASBA has sensitivity and specificity equal to those of DNA PCR and culture on PBMC for the diagnosis of infection in infants with the clade B virus. This standardized method gives rapid results on a small volume of plasma and seems well suited for diagnosis on a large scale."

CD011926,0,1663508,0,Amplification and characterization of herpesvirus DNA in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with acute encephalitis.,"A single pair of oligonucleotide primers selected within a highly conserved region of the DNA polymerase gene of the herpesviruses was designed to amplify related viral genomes, i.e., herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus, by the polymerase chain reaction. A simple restriction enzyme analysis of these amplified products allowed accurate characterization of the herpesvirus type. Ninety-nine cerebrospinal fluid samples from 36 patients (including newborns, children, and adults) with acute encephalitis were tested for the presence and identification of herpesvirus DNA by this approach. High levels of viral DNA, which were readily visualized by simple ethidium bromide staining, were found in all these patients from the first days of the disease and, in some cases, until the third week following the onset of acute encephalitis. The herpesvirus type was rapidly identified by enzymatic digestion in 33 patients' samples and by hybridization and direct sequencing in the last 3 patients' samples. Our results show that the polymerase chain reaction provides a highly sensitive and specific technique for the identification of herpesviruses DNA in cerebrospinal fluid that should be of value for early and rapid diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, prognostic evaluation, and epidemiological studies."

Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the predominant aetiological agents during seasonal epidemics, and thus rapid and sensitive molecular tests for screening for such agents and timely identification of epidemics are required. This study compared real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) with conventional RT-PCR for parallel identification of influenza A virus (IAV) or influenza B virus (IBV) and RSV. A total of 1091 respiratory samples was examined from children with suspected ARTIs between January 2007 and December 2008. Of these, 275 (25.21 %) were positive for either influenza or RSV by qPCR compared with 262 (24 .01%) positive by RT-PCR. Overall, IAV, IBV and RSV were detected in 121 (11.09 %), 59 (5.41 %) and 95 (8.71 %) samples, respectively. In spite of overlapping clinical symptoms, RSV and influenza virus showed distinct seasonal peaks. IAV correlated positively and RSV negatively with rainfall and temperature. No distinct seasonality was observed in IBV infections. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of a systemic surveillance of respiratory viruses with seasonal correlation and prevalence rates from eastern India. This 2 year comparative analysis also confirmed the feasibility of using qPCR in developing countries, which will not only improve the scope for prevention of epidemics, but will also provide crucial epidemiological data from tropical regions."
CD011926,0,8743915,0,Case report: paucity of interlobular bile ducts in Chinese children.,"Sixteen Chinese children with cholestasis since early infancy were diagnosed to have paucity of interlobular bile ducts (PILBD) or its equivalent. Twelve children belonged to the syndromic group of PILBD and four children belonged to the non-syndromic group. A definite histological diagnosis of bile duct paucity was established in only two children (aged 4 and 9 months) during the first percutaneous needle biopsy. In the remaining 14 children a varying degree of bile duct destruction was evident in the follow up percutaneous or wedge liver biopsies. The evolving changes were characterized by inflammatory infiltration near or at the ductal wall, the presence of dysmorphic ductules, the degeneration of ductal epithelia and a progressive decrease of interlobular bile ducts. Of 10 children who underwent laparotomy for definite diagnosis, kasai operation was performed in two of them. In the syndromic PILBD group, all children, including two paired siblings, had at least three of five major clinical features. Hypoplasia of the extrahepatic biliary tree was found in five children and atresia of the extrahepatic bile duct was found in one. Three of six children studied were shown, by polymerase chain reaction, to have cytomegalovirus infection in the liver. This study demonstrates that bile duct paucity is a result of progressive bile duct destruction. A definitive diagnosis is difficult to make in early infancy. Thus, the careful evaluation of extrahepatic features in cholestatic children and follow-up liver biopsies are indicated. Although the pathogenetic mechanism of PILBD is unknown, bile duct destruction is the common pathway leading to paucity of bile ducts irrespective of syndromic or non-syndromic types."
CD011926,0,21986825,0,Extended-spectrum-β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli as a cause of pediatric infections: report of a neonatal intensive care unit outbreak due to a CTX-M-14-producing strain.,"Little information is available about pediatric infections caused by extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli. We characterized an outbreak caused by a CTX-M-14-producing E. coli isolate in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and studied other infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli in non-NICU pediatric units. All children ≤4 years old who were infected or colonized by ESBL-producing E. coli isolates between January 2009 and September 2010 were included. Molecular epidemiology was studied by phylogroup analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing. Antibiotic resistance genes were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Plasmids were studied by PFGE with S1 nuclease digestion and by incompatibility group analysis using a PCR-based replicon-typing scheme. Of the ESBL-producing E. coli isolates colonizing or infecting the 30 newborns, identical PFGE results were observed for 21 (70%) isolates, which were classified as CTX-M-14-producing E. coli of ST23 phylogroup A. bla(CTX-M-14a) was linked to ISEcp1 and was carried on an ∼80-bp IncK plasmid. A smaller ongoing outbreak due to SHV-12-producing ST131 E. coli was also identified in the same NICU. Fifteen additional infections with ESBL-producing E. coli were identified in non-NICU pediatric units, but none was caused by the CTX-M-14-producing E. coli epidemic clone. Overall, CTX-M-14 (71.1%), CTX-M-15 (13.3%), and SHV-12 (13.3%) were the most important ESBLs causing pediatric infections in this study. Infections of newborns with CTX-M-14-producing E. coli were caused by both clonal and nonclonal isolates."

Quentin, H. Huet, F.-S. Wang, P. Geslin, A. Goudeau, and R. K. Selander, J. Clin. Microbiol. 33:2576-2581, 1995) were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay. Four primers, 5'AGGGGGTTCC3', 5'AACGCGCAAC3', 5'GCATCAATCT3', and 5'AGTCGGGTGG3', named OPS16, AP42, A4, and OPS11, respectively, were selected from 29 primers tested. This investigation identified 71 RAPD types. The three families of strains defined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis analysis, which contain most of the cerebrospinal fluid isolates, were also identified by clustering analysis of RAPD data. Each of these three groups exhibits specific RAPD patterns or fragments. The discriminatory power of the RAPD typing method was also evaluated. The simplest typing scheme was obtained by the combination of RAPD typing done with primers AP42 and OPS11 and serotyping (index of discrimination, 0.97)."
CD011926,0,10399450,0,Human parvovirus B19: relevance in internal medicine.,"Infection by the human parvovirus B19 can lead to several clinical manifestations which are relevant in internal medicine. These include aplastic crisis in chronic haemolytic anaemias, exanthemathous disease and arthropathy, mainly in women, and chronic anaemia in the immunocompromised host. After initial replication, probably in the respiratory tract, the virus enters its target cells in the bone marrow, erythroid precursor cells, through its receptor, the blood group P antigen. Viral replication in these cells leads to an arrest in erythropoiesis, normally lasting approximately 1 week. In this stage, an aplastic crisis can be produced in all patients under 'erythropoietic stress'. The viraemia disappears as specific antibodies to the virus become detectable in serum, which may give rise to a rash or arthralgia, symptoms that are probably immune-mediated. In immunologically normal individuals the infection is cleared by the humoral immune system within several weeks, whereafter detectable specific IgG confers lifelong immunity to reinfection. In patients with absent or dysfunctional humoral immunity to this virus, however, persistent infection can occur, which results in chronic suppression of erythropoiesis with chronic anaemia. Passive immunization, by means of normal immunoglobulin preparations has been reported to be effective in treating this condition. Diagnosis of parvovirus infection is usually possible by the detection of specific antibodies of IgM class in cases of recent infection. In patients with aplastic crisis and patients with chronic anaemia diagnosis rests upon the detection of parvovirus B19 DNA in serum by polymerase chain reaction. Parvovirus B19 is a ubiquitous virus. By the age of 15, about 50% of individuals have serologic evidence of a past infection, which may present as the common childhood disease erythema infectiosum. At the age of 70, seroprevalence reaches 80 to 100%. A vaccine against this virus is currently being developed."
CD011926,0,18094127,0,Development of PCR assays with nested primers specific for differential detection of three human anelloviruses and early acquisition of dual or triple infection during infancy.,"We recently identified a novel human virus classifiable into a third group in the genus Anellovirus, tentatively designated torque teno midi virus (TTMDV), with a circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb and genomic organization resembling those of torque teno virus (TTV) (3.8 to 3.9 kb) and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) (2.8 to 2.9 kb). TTMDV was characterized by extreme genetic diversity similar to the TTV and TTMV genomes. Taking advantage of universal and virus species-specific primers derived from a highly conserved area located just downstream of the TATA box of the TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV genomes, a PCR method with simultaneous amplification of the genomic DNAs of these three anelloviruses in the first round and subsequent differential amplifications of these viruses in the second round was developed. High prevalence of TTMDV viremia was seen in adults (75/100 [75%]), comparable with the prevalences of TTV viremia (100%) and TTMV viremia (82%). Although none of 10 cord blood samples had detectable TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV DNAs, the prevalences of these three anelloviruses increased with the number of months after birth of the individual and reached 100% for individuals at one year of age. Dual or triple infection of TTV, TTMDV, and/or TTMV was seen in 10 (47.6%) of 21 infants 9 to 180 days of age and more frequently among infants 181 to 364 days of age (20/23 [86.9%]), comparable with the 93.1% (243/261) prevalence among subjects 1 to 81 years of age, indicating early acquisition of dual or triple anellovirus infection during infancy."

CD011926,0,7510308,0,Direct PCR enables detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in patients with respiratory tract infections.,"The sensitivities of three methods of detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae by a 16S rDNA PCR were compared by using a serial dilution of M. pneumoniae. These methods consisted of a PCR performed directly on cells after a proteinase K pretreatment (direct PCR), a PCR after purification of nucleic acids (DNA-PCR), and a PCR with rRNA sequences as the target after reverse transcription. The direct PCR and the reverse transcription PCR had a sensitivity of 1.5 CFU (approximately 250 genomes). By purification, a 10-fold loss of target DNA occurred, as shown by a 10-fold decrease in sensitivity (15 CFU) of the DNA-PCR. The presence of an excess of human background DNA did not influence the sensitivity of either PCR. The direct PCR was evaluated on samples from patients with respiratory complaints. Direct PCR amplification was possible in 94.9% of the samples, which were tested by amplification of a 326-bp fragment of the beta-globin gene, which was performed to test for the suitability of amplification. Nucleic acid purification was performed on the beta-globin-negative samples, after which only 2% remained negative. A positive correlation between the direct M. pneumoniae PCR and serology, as tested by the microparticle agglutination assay (MAG assay), was found in 88.1% of the cases. A positive MAG assay result was found for samples from 10 (17%) of the patients; samples from 6 (10.2%) of these patients were also positive by PCR. Samples from three patients were found to be positive by the M. pneumoniae PCR and negative by the MAG assay. Persistence of M. pneumoniae, as detected by PCR was observed in three patients. These results indicate that the direct PCR with 16S rDNA could prove to be useful in the detection of M. pneumoniae in respiratory tract samples, although more studies are needed to evaluate the correlation between clinical symptoms and positive test results."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the demographic features, clinical manifestations, and outcome of C. trachomatis pneumonia patients seen during the past 10 years in one medical center. We reviewed the records on 30 patients with a diagnosis of C. trachomatis pneumonia. The diagnosis was based on characteristic clinical features and confirmed by culture, serologic testing, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinical features including age, sex, symptoms at the time of admission, laboratory data, and treatment were analyzed. Of the 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), 29 (96%) were less than 4 months old (range 10 days to 5 months). All patients had productive cough followed by tachypnea. Three patients (10%) presented with apnea. Four (13%) had conjunctivitis. Fever was present in only 3 (10%), of whom 2 also had concurrent respiratory syncytial virus infection. Peripheral eosinophilia (eosinophils > or = 400/mm3) was present in 14 (47%) patients. Hyperinflation was seen on chest x-ray in 15 patients. All infants were treated with erythromycin and responded well. The mean time to clinical improvement was 3.53 days after the start of treatment. The mean duration of hospitalization was 8.97 days (range, 3 to 17 days). No patients died. Pediatricians and general practitioners must have a high index of suspicion for chlamydial infection in afebrile infants presenting with tachypnea, peripheral eosinophilia, and hyperinflation on chest x- ray during the first four months of life."

The study included 125 samples from 76 infants positive for HIV-1 DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 106 samples from 101 PCR-negative infants and 116 and 160 samples from seropositive and seronegative mothers, respectively. Samples were boiled to dissociate immune complexes and tested for HIV-1 p24 ag using a p24 ag amplification assay. Reactive samples were confirmed by a neutralization assay. Altogether, 123 of 125 samples from 76 PCR-positive infants were positive for p24 ag (sensitivity = 98.7%). HIV-1 p24 ag was found in all 18 samples collected at 1-8 weeks, in 35 of 36 samples collected at 9-26 weeks, in all 40 samples collected at 27-52 weeks, and in 30 of 31 samples collected > 52 weeks after birth. Detection of HIV-1 p24 ag was significantly more common in transmitting mothers (12 of 29, 41.4%) than in nontransmitting mothers (nine of 87, 10.3%) (p < 0.001). Among mothers with p24 antigenemia, the vertical transmission rate was significantly higher (12 of 21, 57%) than in mothers without p24 antigenemia (17 of 95, 18%) (p < 0.001). All samples from 101 PCR-negative children and 160 seronegative mothers were negative for p24 ag (specificity = 100%). We conclude that using heated plasma or serum increases the sensitivity of the p24 ag assay significantly. This modified simple test may be sufficient for the early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants in settings with limited laboratory facilities.

AAF-labelled Escherichia coli 16 + 23S rRNA was used as a probe for ribotype analysis of 92 clinical isolates from tracheal exsudate, blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and pus. The 92 isolates belonged to the 15 described serovars of C. meningosepticum, and included 21 strains isolated during an outbreak in an intensive care unit, all belonging to serovar G. Three restriction endonucleases, EcoRI, HindIII and PstI, were selected for use in ribotyping after preliminary experiments. Epidemiologically unrelated isolates were discriminated by ribotyping and could be classified into 48 ribotypes according to the hybridization banding patterns obtained after restriction with the three enzymes. Strains which were not discriminated by combined ribotype analysis belonged to the same serovar, and were of identical geographic origin. In one case, analysis with an additional enzyme, PvuII, was necessary for separating strains from two different serovars. However, three strains from different serovars (two isolated from the same place and one elsewhere within eight years) showed the same combined ribotype. Analysis of the rRNA gene patterns revealed 6 different patterns for clinical isolates of the outbreak, suggesting unrelated sources of infection. In three patients, isolation of C. meningosepticum with different combined ribotypes suggested superinfection. Ribotyping enabled differentiation between isolates belonging to the same serovar as well as between isolates of different serovars and provided a useful molecular epidemiological tool for the study of C. meningosepticum. Combined ribotype analysis with several restriction endonucleases increased the discriminating power of the method. However, there was only a partial correlation between serovars and the extent of DNA relatedness."
CD011926,0,8765616,0,Diagnosis of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by a DNA polymerase chain reaction assay among infants enrolled in the Women and Infants' Transmission Study.,"Early diagnosis of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) in young infants is essential to decisions on their medical and social care. Whereas studies have suggested that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a sensitive and timely method of diagnosing HIV infection in children, these evaluations have been limited by the number of specimens studied. Recently, Roche Molecular Systems developed a complete HIV-1 DNA PCR testing kit (from specimen preparation to detection). In this study, use of this PCR test kit was evaluated for the detection of HIV infection in infants of seropositive mothers who were enrolled in the longitudinal, multicenter Women and Infants' Transmission Study. A total of 1209 blood specimens from 483 infants were tested and analyzed. The overall sensitivity and specificity of a single PCR test in determining HIV infection status in infants more than 1 but less than 36 months of age were 95% and 97%, respectively. For infected infants 1 to 6 months of age the sensitivity of the DNA-PCR test was 90% to 100%. In a direct comparison with coculture, the Roche DNA-PCR test was significantly more sensitive than coculture in the detection of HIV-1 in infected infants and was equivalent to coculture for the diagnosis of HIV in infants when a standardized algorithm was used to define infection status."

CD011926,0,18768655,0,Real-time PCR measurement of persistence of Bordetella pertussis DNA in nasopharyngeal secretions during antibiotic treatment of young children with pertussis.,"We used real-time PCR to examine the persistence of Bordetella pertussis DNA in serial nasopharyngeal aspirates from 22 children treated for pertussis. After 5 days of treatment, PCR was positive for all 21 assessable patients. After 14 and 21 days, PCR was still positive for 83% (10/12) and 66% (4/6) of assessable patients, respectively. One patient was tested 1 month after treatment initiation, and B. pertussis DNA was still detectable. Quantitative analysis showed that the DNA concentration diminished during treatment in all except one case. The PCR cycle threshold at which B. pertussis DNA became detectable increased by a mean of 1.7 cycles per day (range, 0.86 to 3.68 cycles per day). Real-time PCR can thus be used to diagnose pertussis in young children for up to 3 weeks after treatment initiation. Its potential value for assessing the treatment outcome remains to be determined."

CD011926,0,18768656,0,Detection of perinatal cytomegalovirus infection and sensorineural hearing loss in belgian infants by measurement of automated auditory brainstem response.,"Since auditory disability causes serious problems in the development of speech and in the total development of a child, it is crucial to diagnose possible hearing impairment as soon as possible after birth. This study evaluates the neonatal hearing screening program in Flanders, Belgium. The auditory ability of 118,438 babies was tested using the automated auditory brainstem response. We selected 194 babies with indicative hearing impairment and 332 matched controls to investigate the association between the presence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in urine samples and sensorineural hearing loss and to analyze the sensibility and specificity of a cell culture assay and a quantitative PCR detection method. Our results indicate that significantly more babies with confirmed hearing impairment were HCMV positive after birth. Further, based on the results of our study, babies with HCMV viral loads above 4.5 log copies/ml urine seem to be 1.4 times more likely to have confirmed hearing impairment. Our follow-up study suggests that the hearing impairment of children infected with HCMV after birth is less likely to improve than that of HCMV-negative infants. Our results confirm that the presence of HCMV before or shortly after birth influences the outcome of hearing impairment."

CD011926,0,21496407,0,Natural killer cell deficiencies in a consecutive series of children with herpetic encephalitis.,"Natural killer (NK) cells play a fundamental role in innate and early phases of adaptive immunity against viral infections, both in humans and in animal models. To date, NK cell deficiencies in patients with severe herpetic infections have been reported in single cases, and their role as predisposing factor is still controversial. Five children affected by herpetic encephalitis were consecutively admitted to the Anna Meyer Children's Hospital in Florence (Italy) between 2003 and 2005. We therefore investigated the presence of NK cell deficiencies in a consecutive series of children with herpetic encephalitis. Five healthy children were included in the study as controls. Differential WBC counts, main Ig and IgE class serum analysis, cytofluorimetric analysis of circulating T, B and NK cells were performed on our study population. Sequencing of a selected region of CD16A gene transcript was carried out in two patients. All patients resulted to be affected by deficiencies related to NK cells in respect to controls. One patient was also affected by lymphopenia, while no other significant deficits of immunity were detected in the study population. To date, this is the first survey that demonstrates isolated NK cell deficiencies in a cohort of consecutive patients affected by severe herpes simplex infections. These findings suggest a role for NK cell deficiencies as a predisposing factor for increased susceptibility and severe course of disease in these patients."

CD011926,0,10469719,0,Evidence for infection of the human embryo with adeno-associated virus in pregnancy.,"Previous reports have demonstrated the presence of DNA of the human helper virus-dependent adeno-associated parvovirus (AAV) in uterine tissue and curettage material from early miscarriage. To examine infection of embryonic tissue during pregnancy, amnion fluids were analysed for the presence of AAV. Using polymerase chain reaction, AAV DNA was detected in 64 out of 238 DNA samples extracted from amnion cells. DNA of helper viruses were found in 12% (papillomavirus) and 18% (cytomegalovirus) of the samples (double infections with AAV in eight and nine cases, respectively). Furthermore, infectious AAV virions were found in 13 out of 43 AAV DNA-containing samples. In mothers with AAV DNA-positive amnion fluids, premature amniorrhexis and premature labour occurred significantly more frequently (P < 0.001). Using an immunofluorescence assay, 24% of newborn sera (unrelated to the amnion fluid samples) were found to contain IgM antibodies to AAV, in most cases paralleled by IgM antibodies in the mother's sera. The data demonstrate that AAV infection can occur in utero at early and at late stages of pregnancy. The observed complications at delivery should encourage studies to clarify possible pathological consequences of AAV infection in pregnancy and a possible latent infection of the fetus."
CD011926,0,2059357,0,"Antigen detection, virus culture, polymerase chain reaction, and in vitro antibody production in the diagnosis of vertically transmitted HIV-1 infection.","Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus culture (V), antigen detection (Ag), and in vitro antibody production (IVAP) assays may be useful for the early detection of vertically transmitted HIV-1 infection in infants under 18 months of age, when a diagnosis cannot be based on seropositivity because of maternal antibody persistence. To assess the reliability of these procedures and to correlate diagnostic results with infection status, 101 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers were evaluated by all these techniques within the first 6 months of life. The children were then followed up to the age of at least 18 months, when diagnosis was made on the basis of AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) onset or persistence of HIV-1 seropositivity. Out of 27 children classified as infected according to the above criteria, 25 (92.5%) were repeatedly positive in IVAP test, 22 (81.5%) in the first PCR analysis, and only 19 (70.3%) in the initial V assay. On further testing, a total of 24 children (88.9%) were found positive in PCR assay, and 23 (85.2%) in V test. All these assays were found to be more sensitive than antigen detection for HIV-1 infection diagnosis, but the antigenaemia was shown to be a useful prognostic marker of disease onset. We also found that both Ag and IVAP assays could give false-positive results in the first 2 months of life, which severely limits their diagnostic value during this period of time. False-positive results in PCR assay could occur at any time of the tested period and were unrelated to the child's age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011926,0,24829249,0,Detection of Herpesviridae in whole blood by multiplex PCR DNA-based microarray analysis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Viral infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The monitoring by PCR of Herpesviridae loads in blood samples has become a critical part of posttransplant follow-up, representing mounting costs for the laboratory. In this study, we assessed the clinical performance of the multiplex PCR DNA microarray Clart Entherpex kit for detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) as a screening test for virological follow-up. Two hundred fifty-five blood samples from 16 transplanted patients, prospectively tested by routine PCR assays, were analyzed by microarray. Routine PCR detected single or multiple viruses in 42% and 10% of the samples, respectively. Microarray detected single or multiple viruses in 34% and 18% of the samples, respectively. Microarray results correlated well with CMV and EBV detections by routine PCR (kappa tests = 0.79 and 0.78, respectively), whereas a weak correlation was observed with HHV-6 (0.43). HHV-7 was also detected in 48 samples by microarray. In conclusion, the microarray is a reliable screening assay for a posttransplant virological follow-up to detect CMV and EBV infections in blood. However, positive samples must be subsequently confirmed and viral loads must be quantified by PCR assays. Limitations were identified regarding HHV-6 detection. Although it is promising, is easy to use as a first-line test, and allows a reduction in the cost of analysis without undue delay in the reporting of the final quantitative result to the clinician, some characteristics of this microarray should be improved, particularly regarding quality control and the targeted virus panel, such that it could then be used as a routine test."

However, in infants, they may lead to severe neurological or cardiac lesions. In neonates, enterovirus infections are difficult to distinguish from late-onset bacterial infection. Maternal-fetal or postnatal transmission can induce early spontaneous abortions or severe neonatal infections. Diagnosis is usually based on viral cultures and, in recent years, on PCR techniques. At the present time, no potential effective drug is available: intravenous immunoglobulins, immunization or anti-proteases may be of interest."
CD011926,0,12777569,0,Transmission of Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium DT104 to infants through mother's breast milk.,"This study documents the first reported transmission of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium definitive type 104 (DT104) to premature fraternal twins via their mother's breast milk. When premature twin neonates developed severe enteritis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), stool samples and the mother's breast milk were cultured for the presence of Salmonella. Antibacterial susceptibility patterns were determined. Semiquantitative organism abundance data were retrospectively gathered on 54 stored breast milk samples collected on 34 different days using a rapid, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology (LightCycler PCR). Fecal samples from other infants in the NICU at that time were also tested. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to assess the genetic composition of the isolated organisms. The twins' neonatal stools and mother's breast milk cultures revealed a resistance pattern (R-type) to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline. LightCycler PCR analysis of sequential breast milk samples confirmed this to be the likely source of transmission. In the subsequent outbreak investigation, none of the NICU surveillance fecal samples proved positive for this organism. The genetic composition of organisms isolated from the maternal breast milk was indistinguishable from those isolated from neonatal specimens as determined by PFGE. Antibiotic susceptibility tests coupled with PFGE patterns suggested that these Salmonella isolates were DT104. Because the prevalence of DT104 infections is rising in the United States, neonatologists should be aware of breast milk as a potential mode of transmission."

We compared PCR to microscopy in detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection in peripheral, placental and cord blood samples collected from 131 pregnant Malawian women and their infants in 1997-99. Infections detected by species-specific PCR were genotyped at the merozoite surface protein 1 and 2 loci, and minimum numbers of infecting genotypes determined. PCR was of similar sensitivity to microscopy in detecting peripheral and placental infection, and placental blood PCR was 100% specific compared to placental histology. Cord blood parasitaemia was more frequently detected by PCR than microscopy, 20% versus 6%. Genotype numbers in peripheral blood (mean 2.36; range 1-5), placental blood (mean 2.41; range 1-6) and cord (mean 2.14; range 1-4) were similar. The frequency of detection of each allelic family did not differ between sites. Genotypes from different sites in each patient were compared. In 69% of women, genotypes were detected in peripheral blood and not placenta, or vice versa, suggesting possible differential sequestration of different parasite populations. Cord blood genotypes were usually a subset of those in peripheral and placental blood, but, in some cases, genotypes were found in cord blood that were absent from the mother. Transplacental infection before term, and clearance of maternal infection, is postulated."

We sought to clarify the relationship between antenatal infection and intrauterine and neonatal inflammation. Samples were obtained from 41 preterm infants of <33 wk gestation delivered to 36 mothers and analyzed for the presence of 16s ribosomal RNA (16s rRNA) genes using PCR and for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. In 16 (44%) mother-baby pairings, at least one sample was found to be positive for the presence of 16s rRNA genes. All but one of the positive samples were from mothers presenting with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pPROM) or in spontaneous idiopathic preterm labor. A strong association was found between the presence of 16s rRNA genes and chorioamnionitis and with funisitis. A marked increase in IL-6 and IL-8 was noted in all tissues positive for 16s rRNA genes, including placenta, fetal membranes, cord blood serum, and, where samples were available, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and in amniotic fluid. Interestingly, gastric fluid was always positive for 16s rRNA genes if any other intrauterine or BAL sample was positive, suggesting that this sample may provide an alternative to amniotic fluid to identify antenatal infection. In conclusion, we have found that microbial genes are particularly prevalent in pPROM and spontaneous preterm labor groups and that their presence is strongly associated with a marked intrauterine inflammatory response."
CD011926,0,25811386,0,Consolidating HIV testing in a public health laboratory for efficient and sustainable early infant diagnosis (EID) in Uganda.,"Uganda introduced an HIV Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) program in 2006, and then worked to improve the laboratory, transportation, and clinical elements. Reported here are the activities involved in setting up a prospective analysis in which the Ministry of Health, with its NGO partners, determined it would be more effective and efficient to consolidate the initial eight-laboratory system for EID testing of HIV dried blood samples offered by two nongovernmental partners operating research facilities into a single well-equipped and staffed laboratory within the Ministry. A retrospective analysis confirmed that redesign reduced overhead cost per PCR test of HIV dried blood samples from US$22.20 to an average of $5. Along with the revamped system of sample collection, transportation, and result communication, Uganda has been able to vastly increase the HIV diagnosis of babies and engagement of them and their mothers in clinical care, including antiretroviral therapy. Uganda reduced turnaround times for results reporting to clinicians from more than a month in 2006 to just 2 weeks by 2014, even as samples tested increased dramatically.

This study sought to unify phenotypic and genotypic classifications of type III GBS strains associated with increased virulence in newborns. High-virulence clonotype (HVC) strains possessed the translation initiation factor 2 (infB) C allele, found in RDP type III-3 strains, and hybridized with the RDP type III-3-specific probe AA3.6, whereas non-HVC strains shared the infB A allele and genomic DNA from these strains did not hybridize with the AA3.6 probe. The characteristic growth lag of HVC GBS at 40 degrees C has been attributed to the presence of a heat-labile fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (Fba) enzyme in these strains. The deduced amino acid sequence of fba genes of both HVC and non-HVC strains, however, were identical. HVC and RDP type III-3 represent the same genetically related group of bacteria. The characteristic growth differences of virulent strains of type III GBS, however, are not directly attributable to differences in fba."

The use of genome detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and the quantification of anti-HIV-1 antibodies were examined as methods for early diagnosis. Blood samples were taken from 84 non-breast-fed infants of HIV-infected mothers in five Italian and Spanish centres, a subgroup of children enrolled in the European Collaborative Study (ECS) for whom clinical and immunological information has been documented from birth. Whole blood was added to glycigel cryopreservative, stored, and tested in the United Kingdom by a nested PCR method. Antibody to HIV-1 was detected and quantified by titration using a gelatin particle agglutination test. PCR sensitivity and specificity were assessed. Twenty-one of the 84 children tested were infected. The estimated PCR sensitivity ranged from 0% (95% CI 0-26%) on day 1, 57% (19-85) on day 7, to 63% (33-92) on day 30. The negative predictive value of PCR ranged from 85% (83-88) on day 0 to 98% (94-100) at 3 months of age. On average, the level of maternal antibody halved every 33 days (31-36.5) in uninfected children. Between 6 and 9 months of age, increases in antibody titres in infected children were not more informative than absolute levels. These findings suggest that antibody measurement may supplement genomic diagnosis and that this collection method provides an alternative to the use of dried blood spots."

Accurate and rapid diagnosis is crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the dltR gene was utilised for the direct detection of GBS DNA in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from infants at an Irish maternity hospital. A retrospective review of laboratory and patient records during the period 2011-2013 was performed in order to evaluate PCR and culture for the diagnosis of invasive GBS disease. A total of 3570 blood and 189 CSF samples from 3510 infants had corresponding culture and PCR results. Culture and PCR exhibited concordance in 3526 GBS-negative samples and 13 (25%) GBS-positive samples (n = 53). Six (11%) and 34 (64%) GBS-positive samples were positive only in culture or PCR, respectively. Culture and PCR identified more GBS-positive infants (n = 47) than PCR (n = 43) or culture (n = 16) alone. Using culture as the reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PCR on blood samples were 71.4%, 99.2%, 25% and 99.9%, and for CSF samples, they were 60%, 97.8%, 42.9% and 98.9%, respectively. The sensitivity and positive predictive values were improved (blood: 84.6% and 55%; CSF: 77.8% and 100%, respectively) when maternal risk factors and other laboratory test results were considered. The findings in this study recommend the use of direct GBS real-time PCR for the diagnosis of GBS infection in infants with a clinical suspicion of invasive disease and as a complement to culture, but should be interpreted in the light of other laboratory and clinical findings."

CD011926,0,25329126,0,Role of optic microscopy for early diagnosis of Menkes disease.,"We report the case of a male patient with a normal development in the first three months of life, presenting for global regression, central axial hypotonic syndrome, pyramidal syndrome, focal epileptic seizures, and a particular aspect of the hair - almost absent, short, sparse, lightly colored, at age of five months, becoming coarse, twisted (kinky hair) by the age of 21 months. Different diseases associate similar neurological and macroscopic aspect of the hair (biotinidase deficiency, argininosuccinic aciduria, aminoaciduria, giant axonal neuropathy, trichothiodistrophy and Menkes syndrome). The microscopic aspect of the patient's hair showing normal hair, silver colored hair, hair shafts twisting 1800, trichoclasis, and trichoptilosis, was highly characteristic for Menkes disease. Diagnosis was further supported by the low concentration of serum copper and ceruloplasmin and exclusion of other metabolic disorders with similar macroscopic aspect of the hair. Molecular genetic testing by multiplex PCR indicated deletion of exon 22 in the ATP7A gene situated in Xq21.1 region, consistent with the clinical and biochemical phenotype. Physicians should use microscopic evaluation of the hair more often when suspicion of Menkes disease is raised, aiming a narrow further diagnostic workup and early positive diagnosis and genetic advice for the affected families."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and disease profile of HIV infected children under 5 years of age admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Soweto, South Africa and to assess the impact of pediatric HIV on health services. Over a 6-month period, serial pediatric admissions to one of the children's wards were screened for HIV. Data on demographics and disease profile were recorded for all patients. A total of 549 patients were admitted, of whom 507 were tested for HIV; 29.2 per cent were considered to be truly infected. Previous admissions to hospital were more frequent in the HIV infected group, 48 per cent compared with 20.4 per cent of HIV uninfected children (p < 0.01), with a median length of stay of 8 days compared with 6 days (p < 0.01). There were more malnourished children in the HIV infected group (65.8 per cent compared with 33.1 per cent) (p < 0.01) and more died (17 per cent compared with 4.6 per cent) (p < 0.01). The most common reasons for admission in all children were infectious diseases such as pneumonia and gastroenteritis (85 and 31.9 per cent compared with 51 and 22.5 per cent, respectively in the HIV infected and uninfected groups, p < 0.01 and p < 0.03).

CD011926,0,10996985,0,Prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and its vertical transmission in Egyptian pregnant women and their newborns.,"We studied the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody seropositivity using ELISA (Ortho Diagnostic system, 3rd generation test) polymerase chain reaction testing of HCV-RNA (PCR, Promega) and serum alanine transferase (ALT) level in 100 healthy, HIV-negative, pregnant women who delivered spontaneously at the Alexandria University Hospital, and their newborns. Some risk factors were studied using Fisher's exact test. Nineteen per cent of pregnant women were HCV seropositive and 14 of them (14/19) had circulating HCV-RNA, detected by PCR. Nine of the babies born to the 19 HCV seropositive females had circulating antibodies, whereas HCV-RNA was detected in five of them. This gives a vertical transmission risk of 5/14 (36 per cent) for mothers carrying the HCV-RNA and 5/19 (26 per cent) for those having circulating HCV antibodies. History of previous blood transfusion, elevated serum ALT level, and history of infection with schistosomiasis were significant risk factors for HCV infection in mothers. In addition to the previous factors, maternal history of jaundice, stillbirth and hepatomegaly were significant risk factors for neonatal infection. The occurrence of early jaundice and the presence of congenital anomalies in the newborns were non-significant risk factors. In conclusion, our data indicate a high prevalence of HCV seropositivity in Egyptian HIV-negative pregnant women with a significant high rate of vertical transmission of HCV."

We analysed records of 99 Buruli ulcer (BU) patients diagnosed clinically and treated surgically at Amasaman Health Centre in Ghana, for whom post-treatment diagnostic laboratory tests were performed. Comparison of clinical diagnoses with test results obtained by an in-country laboratory on samples of excised tissue showed a high specificity of clinical judgement. Among lesions with three laboratory tests (microscopy for acid fast bacilli, culture and IS2404 polymerase chain reaction) done, 94% tested positive at least once and 83% twice.

CD011926,0,25102109,1,Development of a multiplex real-time PCR assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.,"The diagnosis of late onset sepsis (LOS), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. Detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by PCR would provide a much more timely result. Unfortunately, PCR-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. Therefore we developed a real-time multiplex PCR assay tailored to LOS diagnosis which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. Species-specific PCR assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Serratia marcescens. The PCR assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (LOD) of ≤10CFUeq./reaction. These LOD values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial DNA was isolated from blood. Clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex PCR and blood culture. In conclusion, we developed a multiplex PCR that allows the direct detection of the most important bacterial pathogens causing LOS in preterm infants."

The main approach to prevent genital HSV infection in the neonate is interruption of transmission at the time of delivery. Guidelines for prophylactic therapy with acyclovir have been established, but the risk of neonatal infection remains. A fever began to develop in a male neonate delivered vaginally from a 35-year-old woman. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir was started on the basis of a diagnosis of HSV encephalitis, because polymerase chain reaction was positive for HSV in the cerebrospinal fluid. The mother had had a first genital HSV infection during the second trimester, but treatment with injected acyclovir had caused the blisters and erosion to resolve by the time of delivery. Important steps for preventing neonatal HSV infection are the appropriate treatment of mothers with a history of genital HSV infection, the assessment of delivery methods, and the appropriate treatment of neonates."

Routine stool samples were taken weekly from all babies up to the age of 28 days. Overall, 51 (11.7%) of the neonates excreted rotaviruses while in hospital, of whom 42 (82.3%) developed asymptomatic nosocomial infection; nosocomial infection was also proved in five of the nine patients with diarrhea. Three distinct RNA profiles were detected, of which one short electropherotyping pattern was far more frequent ( approximately 90% of the strains). Using monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassays, 32 (62.7%) of the rotavirus-positive strains were classified as G2, and 1 (1.9%) as mixed G1 and G2. A G serotype could not be assigned to 18 (35.3%) of the isolates. A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used for determining the VP4 type-specificity of a subset of 28 rotavirus-positive samples. Characterization of the VP7-genotype specificity was also sought for 18 of these latter strains. Overall, P[6] and G2 genotypes were identified in 93% and 94% of tested samples respectively, with results being further confirmed by Southern hybridization. Although surveillance was conducted during a 25-month period, 50 (98%) of 51 rotavirus isolates clustered between January and December 1997. The earliest [P6]G2 rotavirus infections were detected by late January 1997, involving two (13- and 14-day-old) babies admitted with acute diarrhea. Thereafter, strains bearing these genotype specificities were identified among five infants with hospital-acquired gastroenteritis, followed by 16 others who were infected asymptomatically.

CD011926,0,16758791,0,Early detection of HIV-1 in infants by PCR.,"Infants of HIV-infected mothers are at great risk of becoming infected with HIV during childbirth. Many infants acquire HIV during labor and delivery. Others can acquire HIV through the mixing of fetal and maternal blood as the placenta separates. The duration of membrane rupture, acute chorioamnionitis and invasive delivery techniques that increase the baby's contact with the mother's blood have been associated with higher risks of MTCT during labor and delivery. HIV is present in breast milk and risk of its transmission during breastfeeding depends on several factors, including: infant age, pattern of breastfeeding, breastfeeding duration, breast health, maternal viral load and maternal immune status. Infants born to HIV infected mothers carry their mother's antibodies in their blood into the second year of life, even if the infants themselves are not infected. For this reason, standard HIV antibody tests cannot reliably confirm HIV infection in infants until after the maternal antibodies have disappeared. Tests that can diagnose pediatric HIV infection accurately during the first year of life include HIV-PCR, CD4/CD8 counts, P24 antigen tests, and viral cultures. PCR offers an effective tool to reliably diagnose HIV in a pediatric age group. Nineteen infants born by normal delivery to HIV-1 seropositive mothers were studied by PCR for the HIV1 env gene. Thirteen babies (68.5%) were negative whereas 6 babies were found to be positive (31.5%). Although PCR is one of the most useful tests for this clinical situation, it is not definitive. Therefore, PCR should be interpreted with caution and repeated at regular defined intervals, preferably lasting until the HIV antibody status of the infant is resolved."

We show that mothers and infants who have CD3-negative cells that respond to HIV-1 peptides are substantially less likely to transmit and acquire infection, respectively. The CD3-negative cells, shown to be NK cells, respond with remarkable specificity and high magnitude to HIV-1 peptides from Env (envelope) and Reg (regulatory) protein regions, as measured by a whole blood intracellular cytokine assay only in the context of HIV-1 infection or exposure.

In six patients, the isolates were considered as clinically significant, three definite (sepsis), two probable (sepsis and soft tissue infection), and one possible (post-transfusional bacteremia). In the remaining 6 patients (all neonatal bacteremias), there was not enough data for considering the isolates as clinical significant. API Coryne identified all isolates as C. jeikeium, while Biolog GP2 correctly identified 7 out of the 14 isolates. Definitive identification was achieved in all isolates by the sequencing of a fragment of 724 to 1423 pb of 16S rDNA. Successive isolations from two patients presented identical random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles. All of the isolates were in-vitro-sensitive to beta-lactams, gentamicin, rifampin, tetracycline, vancomycin, linezolid, and resistant to clindamycin.

In 46% of the cases, a viral finding was observed. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was the main agent associated with encephalitis, as well as meningitis and myelitis. VZV comprised 29% of all confirmed or probable etiologic agents. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and enteroviruses accounted 11% each, and influenza A virus 7%. VZV seems to have achieved a major role in viral infections of CNS. In encephalitis in our population, VZV is clearly more commonly associated with these neurological diseases than HSV. The increase in VZV findings may in part be a pseudophenomenon due to improved diagnostic methods, however, a true increase may have occurred and the pathogenetic mechanisms behind this should be elucidated."

A cross-sectional study was undertaken of hospitalised children <15 years of age in two hospitals investigated for healthcare-associated diarrhoea between November 2011 and June 2012. Stool specimens were analysed for the presence of C. difficile using a two-step testing algorithm including polymerase chain reaction (PCR). C. difficile was cultured and PCR ribotyping performed. Demographic data, illness characteristics and risk factors were compared between children with and without CDI. Non-duplicate stool specimens were collected from 320 children with a median age of 1.2 years (range 3 days to 15 years). Forty-six patients (14 %) tested met the definition for CDI. The overall incidence of CDI was 2.0 per 10,000 bed days. The percentage of positive tests among neonates was only 2.6 %. PCR ribotyping showed a range of strains, with ribotype 014 being the most common. Significant risk factors for CDI were treatment with proton pump inhibitors [risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.09-5.59; p = 0.002], presence of underlying malignancy (RR 2.71, 95 % CI 1.65-4.62; p = 0.001), receiving chemotherapy (RR 2.70, 95 % CI 1.41-4.83; p = 0.003) and exposure to antibiotics (RR 1.17, 95 % CI 0.99-1.17; p = 0.03). C. difficile is an important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhoea in this paediatric population. The notion that neonatal populations will always have high rates of colonisation with C. difficile may not be correct. Several risk factors associated with CDI among adults were also found to be significant."

Isolates were collected from across the Kingdom and phenotypically tested for carbapenemase production. Polymerase chain reaction detection of carbapenemase genes was also performed. Our results indicate that in Saudi Arabia, OXA-48 and NDM-1 are the dominant carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae with low prevalence of VIM. The latter is the most prevalent metallo-beta-lactamase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas oxacillinases, OXA-23 in particular, are the dominant carbapenemases in Acinetobacter baumannii. No KPC or IMP genes were detected. Our study is the first report of OXA-48, NDM-1, and VIM-4 enzymes in Enterobacter from the Kingdom. Also it is the first report of OXA-72 and NDM-1 in A. baumannii in Saudi Arabia, and the coexistence of blaOXA-23 and blaNDM-1 genes in this species in the country. Awareness of the role of international travel in the spread of carbapenem-resistant determinants in the Kingdom, as well as effective infection control interventions in hospitals and strict antimicrobial stewardship in healthcare facilities and the community are keys to combat the rise of carbapenemase producers in the Kingdom."
CD011926,0,25300623,0,Minority HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations and prevention of mother-to-child transmission: perspectives for resource-limited countries.,"The detection and clinical significance of HIV-1 minority drug-resistant variants is a major topic of current HIV research. Whereas much attention has been placed on the clinical impact of minority drug-resistant variants in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy, their possible influence on the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy following prevention of mother-to-child transmission strategies in resource-limited settings remains largely unexplored. This review outlines the clinical significance and detection of minority drug-resistant variants, focusing primarily on studies of minority variants in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and their possible influence on current regimens, especially those available in resource-limited countries. The clinical impact of minority nevirapine-resistant variants that arise in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission, for example, is an important factor to consider when these women initiate antiretroviral therapy that may include nevirapine or efavirenz. Minority nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant variants have been associated with treatment failure in women exposed to single-dose nevirapine. In countries like South Africa, with its longstanding use of single-dose nevirapine, this question is relevant as it is for other resource-limited countries where single-dose nevirapine is used. In the same context, various other minority drug-resistant variants (e.g. Y181C, K65R and thymidine analogue mutations etc.) are discussed. The field of next generation sequencing is very dynamic, with rapid improvements on present technologies and the introduction of novel technologies as discussed in this review. As the impact of minority drug-resistant variants in the setting of prevention of mother-to-child transmission becomes more evident, guidelines for this, especially in resource-limited countries, will need revision in order to optimize the clinical benefit from future antiretroviral therapy."
CD011926,0,11791341,0,Vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus.,"Sensitive detection methods, such as DNA PCR and RNA PCR suggest that vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) occurs at three major time periods; in utero, around the time of birth, and postpartum as a result of breastfeeding (Fig. 1). Detection of proviral DNA in infant's blood at birth suggests that transmission occurred prior to delivery. A working definition for time of infection is that HIV detection by DNA PCR in the first 48 h of life indicates in utero transmission, while peripartum transmission is considered if DNA PCR is negative the first 48 h, but then it is positive 7 or more days later [1]. Generally, in the breastfeeding population, breast milk transmission is thought to occur if virus is not detected by PCR at 3-5 months of life but is detected thereafter within the breastfeeding period [2]. Using these definitions and guidelines, studies has suggested that in developed countries the majority, or two thirds of vertical transmission occur peripartum, and one-third in utero [3-6]. The low rate of breastfeeding transmission is due to the practice of advising known HIV-positive mothers not to feed breast milk. However, since the implementation of antiretroviral treatment in prophylaxis of HIV-positive mothers, some studies have suggested that in utero infection accounts for a larger percentage of vertical transmissions [7]. In developing countries, although the majority of infections occurs also peripartum, a significant percentage, 10-17%, is thought to be due to breastfeeding [2, 8, 9]."
CD011926,0,1452659,0,A novel polymerase chain reaction method for detection of human immunodeficiency virus in dried blood spots on filter paper.,"A method for detection of proviral human immunodeficiency virus DNA in dried blood spots on filter paper by direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed. To develop the method, a standard system was used which was prepared from cells each containing a single integrated provirus and titrated with normal donor blood. This rapid procedure provides virtually quantitative yields of nuclear DNA and exploits most of the standard methodology described for blood specimens. A nested PCR using SK38-SK39 gag as the internal primer pair was also designed; this PCR detected a single copy of provirus per filter at near theoretical frequency with SK19 probe. The utility of the procedure was demonstrated with clinical specimens. Blood spot filters from human immunodeficiency virus-infected and uninfected individuals were readily and unequivocally discriminated. The method is designed for ultimate use with large (1.5-ml) sample preparation tubes that are compatible as PCR tubes with thermal cyclers. This will permit convenient, direct single-tube PCR of dried blood specimens on filters. It should be adaptable to analysis of dried blood spots for a variety of infectious or genetic diseases."

Among the 12 GII genotypes detected in the study, GII.4 was predominant. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of ORF2 (major capsid protein VP1 gene) of the GII.4 NoVs revealed circulation of seven GII.4 variants, Hunter_2004 (2005-2007), Yerseke_2006a (2006), DenHaag_2006b (2007), Osaka_2007 (2007-2009), Apeldoorn_2007 (2008), New Orleans_2009 (2008-2012) and Sydney_2012 (2013), with the Pune strains grouping with the contemporary global reference strains. The Hunter_2004, Osaka_2007 and New Orleans_2009 variants showed prolonged circulation, with the Hunter_2004 and New Orleans_2009 variants differentiating into temporally separated sub-clusters. Analysis of VP1 sequences and predicted structures of the GII.4 variants identified variant specific amino acid positions, particularly in and near (within 8A(°)) the epitopes A-E, displaying differences in the sequence and physicochemical characteristics of the different variants. Comparison with the reference strains of each of the GII.4 variants revealed up to 11 amino acid substitutions at the variant specific positions in the GII.4 strains from Pune. Amino acid variations were also noted among the strains of the same GII.4 variant in Pune. The strains of different sub-clusters identified in the Hunter_2004 and New Orleans_2009 variants showed differences in sequence and physicochemical properties of either or all of the epitopes A, C and E. The study thus describes the temporal variations and diversity of the GII.4 strains in Pune and emphasizes continuous monitoring and analysis of the GII.4 variants."
CD011926,0,22581933,0,miRNA-125b regulates TNF-α production in CD14+ neonatal monocytes via post-transcriptional regulation.,"Neonates, although deficient in cell immunity, frequently reveal sepsis with augmented proinflammatory reactions. Here, we found that neonatal monocytes produced significantly higher TNF-α mRNA and protein than adult monocytes. Assessment of the transcriptional factor found no significant difference of NF-κB p65 level between neonatal and adult monocytes. Addition of Act D to access the half-life of TNF-α mRNA revealed no significant difference of the LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA half-life between them, whereas CHX increased neonatal TNF-α mRNA significantly. This suggests that a post-transcriptional mechanism involves the augmentation of TNF-α production by neonatal monocytes. To examine whether miRNA was involved in the post-transcriptional regulation, differential displays of miRNA array between neonatal and adult MNCs were performed, along with the discovery of hsa-miR-103, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-130a, hsa-miR-454-3p, and hsa-miR-542-3p, which were greater than a twofold decrease or increase after LPS treatment for 4 h. The functional validation identified that miR-125b decreased significantly in association with higher TNF-α expression by neonatal monocytes after LPS stimulation. Transfection of the miR-125b precursor into neonatal monocytes significantly repressed the TNF-α mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that miR-125b negatively regulates TNF-α expression in neonatal monocytes. Modulation of miRNA expression may be used to regulate TNF-α production in newborns with altered proinflammatory reactions."
CD011926,0,15319092,0,"Herpes simplex virus, meningitis and encephalitis in neonates.","The consequences of neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can be severe. Disease can be localized to skin, eye and mouth (SEM disease), involve the central nervous system (CNS) or manifest as disseminated infection involving multiple organs. Most surviving infants in the latter two categories have neurological sequelae, and the mortality rate in the absence of therapy is very high (80%) for babies in the latter category. The International Herpes Management Forum (IHMF) has produced guidelines on the diagnosis, prevention and effective management of neonatal herpes. Neonatal herpes may occur in the absence of skin lesions, so if the infection is suspected, swabs of the oropharynx, conjunctiva, rectum, skin lesions, mucosal lesions and urine should be promptly taken and submitted for virus culture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of HSV DNA. Evidence for disseminated or CNS infection should be sought using liver function tests, complete blood cell count, CSF analysis and chest X-ray, if respiratory abnormalities are present. Neonates with suspected HSV infection should be treated with intravenous aciclovir (20 mg/kg) every 8 h for 21 days. If disease is localized to the SEM, treatment should be limited to 14 days. The neutrophil count for children receiving intravenous aciclovir should be monitored. If the absolute neutrophil count falls below 500/mm3, decreasing the aciclovir dose or administering granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) should be considered. At the end of therapy in CNS and disseminated disease, PCR assessment of CSF should be used and treatment continued if the child remains PCR positive at this site."
CD011926,0,23035201,0,Novel interpretation of molecular diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis according to gestational age at the time of maternal infection.,"From a prospective cohort of 344 women who seroconverted for toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, 344 amniotic fluid, 264 placenta, and 216 cord blood samples were tested for diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis using the same PCR assay. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the PCR assay using amniotic fluid were 86.3% and 97.2%, respectively, and both specificity and positive predictive value were 100%. Using placenta and cord blood, sensitivities were 79.5% and 21.2%, and specificities were 92% and 100%, respectively. In addition, the calculation of pretest and posttest probabilities and the use of logistic regression allowed us to obtain curves that give a dynamic interpretation of the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis according to gestational age at maternal infection, as represented by the three sample types (amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood). Two examples are cited here: for a maternal infection at 25 weeks of amenorrhea, a negative result of prenatal diagnosis allowed estimation of the probability of congenital toxoplasmosis at 5% instead of an a priori (pretest) risk estimate of 33%. For an infection at 10 weeks of amenorrhea associated with a pretest congenital toxoplasmosis risk of 7%, a positive PCR result using placenta at birth yields a risk increase to 43%, while a negative result damps down the risk to 0.02%. Thus, with a molecular diagnosis performing at a high level, and in spite of the persistence of false negatives, posttest risk curves using both negative and positive results prove highly informative, allowing a better assessment of the actual risk of congenital toxoplasmosis and finally an improved decision guide to treatment."

Early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants.","To promote progress in the research and development of early diagnostic tests for HIV in young children an international workshop was held on January 17-18, 1992, in Siena, Italy. Experts on pediatric AIDS, diagnostic retrovirology, and immunodiagnosis discussed and summarized the state-of-the-art and made recommendations for general application of several tests and further evaluation and continued research for other candidate tests. From the discussions it was clear that the field has advanced beyond the time when it was necessary to wait until the infant reached 18 months of age before attempting the diagnosis with conventional serologic tests for HIV. About half of infected infants can now be identified at birth, approximately 90% by 3 months of age, and almost all by 6 months of age using HIV culture and polymerase chain reaction assays. IgA antibody tests and p24 antigen tests have also proved useful, although they are not as sensitive in newborn infants. The fact that HIV can be detected in only one-half of infected infants at the time of birth points to the need for further research on the timing of transmission and the natural history of perinatally acquired HIV infection to understand the limitations of current early diagnostic tests and to develop new approaches to overcome these problems."

However, bacterial pathogens may be infrequently identified. Currently, culture and enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) are the primary methods used by clinical laboratories to detect enteric bacterial pathogens. We conducted a multicenter evaluation of the BD Max enteric bacterial panel (EBP) PCR assay in comparison to culture for the detection of Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli and an EIA for Shiga toxins 1 and 2. A total of 4,242 preserved or unpreserved stool specimens, including 3,457 specimens collected prospectively and 785 frozen, retrospective samples, were evaluated. Compared to culture or EIA, the positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) values for the BD Max EBP assay for all specimens combined were as follows: 97.1% and 99.2% for Salmonella spp., 99.1% and 99.7% for Shigella spp., 97.2% and 98.4% for C. jejuni and C. coli, and 97.4% and 99.3% for Shiga toxins, respectively. Discrepant results for prospective samples were resolved with alternate PCR assays and bidirectional sequencing of amplicons. Following discrepant analysis, PPA and NPA values were as follows: 97.3% and 99.8% for Salmonella spp., 99.2% and 100% for Shigella spp., 97.5% and 99.0% for C. jejuni and C. coli, and 100% and 99.7% for Shiga toxins, respectively. No differences in detection were observed for samples preserved in Cary-Blair medium and unpreserved samples. In this large, multicenter study, the BD Max EBP assay showed superior sensitivity compared to conventional methods and excellent specificity for the detection of enteric bacterial pathogens in stool specimens."

PVL-MRSA collected during 2005-6 from community-based and hospitalised patients located across England and Wales were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Representative geographically and temporally unrelated isolates were characterised via toxin gene profiling, SCCmec, spa and agr typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations. PVL-MRSA were identified from 275 patients. Affected individuals were <1 to 95 years of age (mean 30, median 27 years). Forty-five isolates were from 18 household or community-based clusters and 23 isolates were from outbreaks in healthcare settings. Overall, 58% (n = 161) had skin and soft tissue infections and 9% (n = 25) presented with or developed more serious disease, including eight patients (3%) with necrotising pneumonia, five of whom subsequently died. PVL-MRSA were genetically diverse and harboured SCCmecIV or V(T)/VII. Representatives of MLST clonal complexes (CCs) 8, 30 and 80 were identified the most often. The 275 PVL-MRSA included internationally disseminated community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains, as well as other minor lineages, and were associated with typical risk factors and disease presentations."
CD011926,0,23303495,0,Hypermutable Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic fibrosis patients from two Brazilian cities.,"Hypermutable (HPM) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found at high frequencies in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in Europe. We report the results of testing for HPM frequencies, mutator genotype, and antimicrobial resistance of P. aeruginosa strains from Brazilian CF patients. A modified disk diffusion technique was used to quantify antibiotic-resistant subpopulations of an isolate, and estimations of the frequency of mutation to rifampin resistance were determined for 705 isolates from 149 patients attending clinics in two Brazilian cities. Mutations in the mutS gene were detected by sequencing assays. We found 194 (27.5%) HPM isolates in samples from 99 (66.4%) patients. Thirty-five HPM isolates (18.0%) from 31 (31.3%) patients exhibited a high increased spontaneous mutation rate compared with controls, and eight isolates from six patients displayed a defective mutS gene. The dominant HPM population was associated with very low antibiotic resistance levels, while HPM subpopulations were generally more resistant to antimicrobials. A relatively high prevalence of HPM P. aeruginosa in CF patients was associated with surprisingly low antibiotic resistance levels, in contrast to some earlier studies."
CD011926,0,23303493,0,Pathogen chip for respiratory tract infections.,"Determining the viral etiology of respiratory tract infections (RTI) has been limited for the most part to specific primer PCR-based methods due to their increased sensitivity and specificity compared to other methods, such as tissue culture. However, specific primer approaches have limited the ability to fully understand the diversity of infecting pathogens. A pathogen chip system (PathChip), developed at the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS), using a random-tagged PCR coupled to a chip with over 170,000 probes, has the potential to recognize all known human viral pathogens. We tested 290 nasal wash specimens from Filipino children <2 years of age with respiratory tract infections using culture and 3 PCR methods-EraGen, Luminex, and the GIS PathChip. The PathChip had good diagnostic accuracy, ranging from 85.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.3 to 89.7%) for rhinovirus/enteroviruses to 98.6% (95% CI, 96.5 to 99.6%) for PIV 2, compared to the other methods and additionally identified a number of viruses not detected by these methods."

Prospective studies were conducted in 2001-2002 (pre-vaccine) and 2009-2011 (post-vaccine) of children aged 0-16 years with radiologically confirmed pneumonia seen in hospital. Investigations included culture, serology, immunofluorescence antibody and urine antigen testing, with an increased use of PCR assays and expanded panels of pathogens in the post-vaccine study. 241 and 160 children were enrolled in the pre- and post-vaccine studies, respectively (73% aged <5 years). Identification of a causative pathogen was higher post-vaccination (61%) than pre-vaccination (48.5%) (p=0.019). Rates of bacterial infections were not different between post- and pre-vaccine studies (17.5% versus 24%, p=0.258). Viral (31%) and mixed (12.5%) infections were found more often post-vaccination (19.5%, p=0.021) than pre-vaccination (5%, p=0.015). Rates of identified pneumococcal infections were comparable between pre- and post-vaccine studies (14.7% versus 17.4%, p=0.557). Diagnosis of pneumococcal infection post-vaccination improved when PCR was used compared to culture (21.6% versus 6%, p=0.0004). Serotypes included in PCV13 but not PCV7 were identified in 75% (18 out of 24) post-vaccination.

Candidial infection in the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most serious forms of blood stream infection of Candida sp. and mortality is known to be more than 50%. In this research, we employed 27 autopsies with confirmed in vasive CNS yeast infection which were confirmed. In addition to detailed morphological analysis of yeast cells in lesions, in situ hybridization was carried out with an originally designed Candida-specific peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe to identify the candidial infection of each patient. This was followed by histopathological investigation: invasiveness, shape, and distribution of yeast or yeasts with pseudohyphal growth, and a study regarding the correlation between histological characteristics and number of leukocytes in the peripheral blood just before death. Results showed that the, supratentorial region was the most common area of disseminated candidial infection in CNS, and that density was highest in the cerebral gray matter followed by the white matter and basal ganglia. On the other hand, regarding the lesions developed in the cortical area, the average distance from the brain surface was 4.026 mm. This area corresponding to the deeper cortex has a characteristic arterial structure that refers hairpin curving reverse. The structure may contribute to the high incidence of candidial foci in the deeper cortex, because of the increase in shear stress."

Epidemiological investigation was processed by determining phenotypic antibiotic resistance patterns and PFGE profiles. Extremely high MIC levels of resistance were obtained to oxacillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. The incidence of teicoplanin reduced susceptibility revealed 32% without possessing either the vanA or vanB gene by the strains. PFGE revealed 56 well-defined genotypes indicating no clonal relationship of the strains. The propensity of S. haemolyticus to acquire resistance and its pathogenic potential in immunocompromised patients, especially among preterm neonates, emphasise the importance of species level identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci and routinely determine the MIC of proper antibacterial agents for these isolates."

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group.,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 77 neonates with herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease were evaluated retrospectively by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples were collected from 202 infants enrolled in a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group trial that compared vidarabine with acyclovir for the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. HSV DNA was detected in the CSF of 26 (76%) of 34 infants with CNS disease, in 13 (93%) of 14 infants with disseminated infection, and in 7 (24%) of 29 with skin, eye, or mouth (SEM) involvement. One of the 7 PCR-positive SEM patients subsequently developed severe neurologic impairment. Eighteen (95%) of 19 infants with positive CSF PCR results after the completion of 10 days of antiviral therapy experienced significant morbidity or mortality. Application of PCR to neonatal HSV disease may provide additional information on which clinical decisions may be based, although its diagnostic utility outside the research setting is unproven."

From 1997 through 2007, we enrolled 3740 children <5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis who received hospital care at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Group A rotavirus was detected in fecal specimens by enzyme immunoassay. Rotavirus strains were characterized for VP7 (G) and VP4 (P) types with use of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, rotavirus was detected in one-third of children. The median age of children with rotavirus gastroenteritis was 7.8 months, compared with 10.9 months for those without rotavirus in stool specimens (P > .001). Rotavirus circulated throughout the year, with the detection proportion greatest during the dry season (from May through October). A total of 15 single rotavirus strain types were detected during the study period, with genotypes P[8]G1, P[6]G8, P[4]G8, P[6]G1, P[8]G3, and P[6]G9 comprising 83% of all strains characterized. Serotype G12 was detected for the first time in Blantyre during the final 2 years of study. Zoonotic transmission and viral reassortment contributed to the rich diversity of strains identified. Current rotavirus vaccines have the potential to greatly reduce the rotavirus disease burden in Malawi, but they will be required to protect against a broad range of rotavirus serotypes in a young population with year-round rotavirus exposure."

We report an outbreak involving four infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of our hospital that occurred in February 2010. RSV A infection was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Palivizumab was administered to all infants in the NICU.

CD011926,0,16272480,0,Epidemiological survey of human metapneumovirus infection in a large pediatric tertiary care center.,"The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was recently identified and linked to acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI). To assess the clinical importance of this virus in infants and children, we developed a rapid and efficient reverse transcription-PCR-based screening method for a large volume of samples and tested retrospectively a collection of 1,132 respiratory specimens submitted over a full year period to the virology laboratory of a large tertiary care pediatric center in Montreal, Canada. A total of 41 samples from 37 patients were positive by this method. During the winter months of 2001, up to 8% of specimens submitted for respiratory virus testing were hMPV positive. Sequencing data of the hMPV M gene revealed that two genogroups of the virus, each of which can be divided into two subgroups, cocirculated during this time period. A case-controlled study was conducted to compare the symptoms associated with hMPV infection with those involving other etiologic agents causing ARTI. Symptoms most frequently observed in hMPV-positive patients were cough, wheezing, and dyspnea, although the symptomatology could differ substantially from patient to patient. No distinct symptom profile could be associated with hMPV. Three nosocomial cases of hMPV infection were identified. Together, our data suggest that hMPV is a significant cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infections in infants and children. The incidence of the disease and the morbidity associated with the infection justify adding hMPV to the list of common respiratory viruses routinely screened for by clinical laboratories."

CD011926,0,10669339,0,Genital tract human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) shedding and inflammation and HIV-1 env diversity in perinatal HIV-1 transmission.,"This study sought to identify genital tract characteristics associated with vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 DNA and RNA, HIV-1 env diversity, and inflammatory cells were quantified in cervicovaginal lavages (CVLs) of 24 women enrolled in the Women and Infants Transmission Study; 7 women transmitted HIV-1 perinatally. Vaginal candidiasis, HIV-1 culture positivity, levels of HIV-1 DNA and cell-free RNA, and HIV-1 env diversity were significantly higher in the CVLs of transmitters. CVL HIV-1 DNA levels correlated with higher levels of inflammatory cells and cell-free HIV-1 RNA. Of subjects with paired blood and CVL specimens, there was more HIV-1 env heterogeneity between blood and CVLs in transmitters than in nontransmitters. In summary, increased HIV-1 shedding is correlated with a more complex population of HIV-1 quasispecies in the genital tracts of parturient women, which may increase the probability that a fetotropic strain is transmitted."
CD011926,0,16372294,0,Reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV at Saint Camille Medical Centre in Burkina Faso.,"One thousand three hundred and twenty-eight pregnant women with less than 32 weeks of amenorrhea received voluntary counseling and testing at Saint Camille Medical Center from May 1, 2002 to December 30, 2004. Following informed consent and pre-test counseling, HIV screening was performed in 1,202 women. According to the prevention protocol, HIV-positive women received a single dose of Nevirapine (200 mg) during their labor, while their newborn received a single dose of Nevirapine (2 mg/kg) within 72 hr from birth. HIV seroprevalence (11.2%) was higher than in the overall population. One hundred and ninety-three children were born at the end of December 2004; 53 children (27.5%) followed a short breastfeeding protocol for 4 months, while 140 (72.5%) were fed artificially. All the children underwent RT-PCR test for HIV 5-6 months after their birth: 173 (89.6%) were HIV negative whilst 20 children (10.4%) were HIV positive. Out of the 20 positive children 5/53 (9.4%) had received breast milk for 4 months, while the remaining 15/140 (10.7%) had been fed artificially (P = 0.814). Artificially fed babies (3/140 (2.1%)) and 1/53 (1.9%) of those breast fed for 4 months deceased according to mortality rate of HIV-positive children. This shows that there is no statistically significant difference (P = 0.648) between the mortality of artificially fed (3/140 or 2.1%) and breast-fed (1/53 or 1.9%) children. Artificially fed children (20/140 (14.3%)) and 5/53 (9.4%) of breast-fed children died within 6-10 months. This figure indicates that there is no significant difference between the mortality rate of artificially and that of breast-fed children (P = 0.427). Although the HIV prevention program reduced significantly the vertical transmission of HIV at Saint Camille Medical Center, the mortality of artificially fed children was still high due to gastrointestinal diseases. The HIV diagnosis by RT-PCR technique was of great help in the early identification of HIV-infected children."

Clonal relationships were defined by amplification phylotyping, nicotinamide auxotrophy, and outer membrane protein patterns (OMPs). Virulence factor profiles were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction, probe hybridization, and hemagglutination testing. The O18:K1:H7 cystitis, fecal, and NBM isolates were clonally derived. The cystitis isolates and archetypal NBM isolates RS218 and C5 were from the OMP6 subclone of E. coli O18:K1:H7 and exhibited a consensus virulence genotype that included papG allele III (cystitis-associated P fimbrial adhesin), sfaS (S fimbrial adhesin), hlyA (hemolysin), cnf1 (cytotoxic necrotizing factor), iroN (putative siderophore), and ibeA (invasion of brain endothelium).

CD011926,0,24586321,0,Changes in intestinal glucocorticoid sensitivity in early life shape the risk of epithelial barrier defect in maternal-deprived rats.,"Glucocorticoids (GC) contribute to human intestine ontogeny and accelerate gut barrier development in preparation to birth. Rat gut is immature at birth, and high intestinal GC sensitivity during the first two weeks of life resembles that of premature infants. This makes suckling rats a model to investigate postpartum impact of maternal separation (MS)-associated GC release in preterm babies, and whether GC sensitivity may shape MS effects in immature gut. A 4 hours-MS applied once at postnatal day (PND)10 enhanced plasma corticosterone in male and female pups, increased by two times the total in vivo intestinal permeability (IP) to oral FITC-Dextran 4 kDa (FD4) immediately after the end of MS, and induced bacterial translocation (BT) to liver and spleen. Ussing chamber experiments demonstrated a 2-fold increase of permeability to FD4 in the colon immediately after the end of MS, but not in the ileum. Colonic permeability was not only increased for FD4 but also to intact horseradish peroxidase 44 kDa in MS pups. In vivo, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486 or ML7 blockade of myosin light chain kinase controlling epithelial cytoskeleton contraction prevented MS-induced IP increase to oral FD4 and BT. In addition, the GR agonist dexamethasone dose-dependently mimicked MS-increase of IP to oral FD4. In contrast, MS effects on IP to oral FD4 and BT were absent at PND20, a model for full-term infant, characterized by a marked drop of IP to FD4 in response to dexamethasone, and decreased GR expression in the colon only compared to PND10 pups. These results show that high intestinal GC responsiveness in a rat model of prematurity defines a vulnerable window for a post-delivery MS, evoking immediate disruption of epithelial integrity in the large intestine, and increasing susceptibility to macromolecule passage and bacteremia."

We also analysed the seasonality of DEC infections and severity of diarrhoea in children with DEC infection and compared antibiotic resistance in DEC strains isolated from children with and without diarrhoea. Stool samples were analysed for the presence of DEC by culturing followed by PCR. The most prevalent DEC categories in samples from the children were: EAEC (11.2 %); ETEC (6.6 %); EPEC (5.8 %); and EIEC and EHEC (<1 %). DEC strains were isolated significantly more often from diarrhoea cases (21.6 %) than from controls (17.6 %; P = 0.002). The number of children with diarrhoea associated with EAEC, EPEC and ETEC infections peaked in the Bolivian winter (April-September), although the proportion of DEC-positive stool samples was higher during the warm rainy season (October-March). High levels of antibiotic resistance were detected among the DEC strains. In particular, resistance to tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was significantly higher in strains isolated from individuals with diarrhoea than in samples from controls. The severity of disease in children infected with EAEC, EPEC and ETEC varied from mild to severe diarrhoea, although disease severity did not differ significantly between the different DEC categories. ETEC, EPEC and EAEC are commonly found in Bolivia and may cause severe disease in children."

Conventionally serotyped 6A isolates (CS6As) from active population-based surveillance during 1999 and 2006 to 2007 were classified as serotypes 6A and 6C by an expedient and highly accurate serotype 6C-specific PCR assay developed during this study. PCR testing of 636 year 1999, 2006, and 2007 CS6As revealed 6C proportions of 35/214 (16.4%), 141/218 (64.7%), and 141/204 (69.1%), respectively. These results agreed with those from a previously devised monoclonal antibody-based serotyping system (346 CS6As compared). Type 6C IPD incidence significantly increased during 2006 and 2007 compared to during 1999 (0.57 to 0.58 cases per 100,000 and 0.22 cases per 100,000, respectively; 164% increase from 1999 to 2007 [95% confidence interval, 87 to 270%]), while rates of IPD due to types 6A and 6B markedly decreased. In 2007, 31.2% of 6C isolates were not susceptible to penicillin. Serotype 6C is now the predominant serotype associated with serogroup 6 IPD in the United States and is often penicillin nonsusceptible. We performed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) on a limited sampling of 6C isolates with different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. MLST of 42 6C isolates revealed 12 genotypes distributed among six distinct genetic groups. Fifteen 6C isolates shared one of four different MLST types with 6C-negative CS6As. MLST results suggest 6C strains arose from independent recombination events involving only serotype 6A and 6C parental strains."

CD011926,0,11433098,0,Diagnosis of very long chain acyl-dehydrogenase deficiency from an infant's newborn screening card.,"Very long chain fatty acid dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is a rare but treatable cause of cardiomyopathy, fatty liver, skeletal myopathy, pericardial effusions, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. Unrecognized, VLCAD deficiency may be rapidly progressive and fatal, secondary to its cardiac involvement. Because early diagnosis improves outcome, we present a neonate with VLCAD deficiency in whom retrospective analysis of the newborn screening card revealed that a correct diagnosis could have been made by newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry. Our patient demonstrated a classic neonatal course with transient hypoglycemia at birth, interpreted as culture-negative sepsis, followed by a quiescent period notable only for hypotonia and poor feeding. At 3 months, he presented with cardiorespiratory failure and pericardial effusions, requiring pericardiocentesis, tracheostomy, and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Plasma free-fatty acid and acylcarnitine profiles demonstrated small but significant elevations of C14:2, C14:1, C16, and C18:1 acylcarnitine species, findings consistent with a biochemical diagnosis of VLCAD deficiency. Enteral feeds were changed to Portagen formula with marked improvement in cardiac symptoms over several weeks. To confirm the biochemical diagnosis, molecular analysis was performed by analysis of genomic DNA on a blood sample of the patient. Sequencing analysis and delineation of VLCAD mutations were performed using polymerase chain reaction and genomic sequencing. The patient was heterozygous for 2 different disease-causing mutations at the VLCAD locus. The maternal mutation was a deletion of bp 842-3 in exon 8, causing a shift in the reading frame. The paternal mutation was G+1A in the consensus donor splice site after exon 1; this splice-site mutation would likely result in decreased mRNA. The likely consequence of these mutations is essentially a null phenotype. To determine whether this case could have been picked up by tandem mass spectrometry analysis at birth when the patient was asymptomatic, acylcarnitine analysis was performed on the patient's original newborn card (after obtaining parental consent, the original specimen was provided courtesy of Dr Kenneth Pass, Director, New York State Newborn Screening Program). The blood sample had been obtained at 1 week of age and stored at room temperature for 6 months and at 70 degrees C thereafter for 18 months. Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry used a LC-MS/MS API 2000 operated in ion evaporation mode with the TurboIonSpray ionization probe source. The acylcarnitine profile obtained from the patient's original newborn card was analyzed 2 years after it was obtained. In comparison with a normal control, there was a significant accumulation of long chain acylcarnitine species, with a prominent peak of tetradecenoylcarnitine (C14:1), the most characteristic metabolic marker of VLCAD deficiency. This profile would have likely been even more significant if it had been analyzed at the time of collection, yet 2 years later is sufficient to provide strong biochemical evidence of the underlying disorder. Discussion. VLCAD was first discovered in 1992, and clinical experience with VLCAD deficiency has been accumulating rapidly. Indeed, the patients originally diagnosed with long chain acyl-CoA deficiency suffer instead from VLCAD deficiency. The phenotype of VLCAD deficiency is heterogeneous, ranging from catastrophic metabolic and cardiac failure in infancy to mild hypoketotic, hypoglycemia, and exertional rhabdomyolysis in adults. This case demonstrates that VLCAD deficiency could have been detected from the patient's own neonatal heel-stick sample. Most likely, a presymptomatic diagnosis would have avoided at least part of a lengthy and intensive prediagnosis hospitalization that had an estimated cost of $400 000. Although VLCAD is relatively rare, timely and correct diagnosis leads to dramatic recovery, so that detection by newborn screening could prevent the onset of arrhythmias, heart failure, metabolic insufficiency, and death. Fatty acid oxidation defects, including VLCAD deficiency, may account for as many as 5% of sudden infant death patients. Recent instrumentation advances have made automated tandem mass spectrometry of routine neonatal heel-stick samples technically feasible. Pilot studies have demonstrated an incidence of fatty acid oxidation defects, including short chain, medium chain, and very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies, of approximately 1/12 000. As a result, cost-benefit ratios for this approach should be systematically examined."
CD011926,0,11990701,0,Human herpesvirus 6 infection mimicking juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia in an infant.,"In vitro cell culture studies of bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cells from patients with juvenile myclomonocytic leukemia (JMML) consistently show spontaneous proliferation and selective hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This GM-CSF hypersensitivity dose-response assay has become a component of the international diagnostic criteria for JMML. The authors report a 2-week-old boy with perinatal human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infection in whom in vitro bone marrow culture studies suggested the diagnosis of JMML by showing increased spontaneous proliferation, inhibition of this growth by anti-GM-CSF antibodies, and hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. Polymerase chain reaction viral studies from whole blood DNA and the shell vial viral culture assay were both positive for HHV-6. The patient's condition improved with expectant treatment, with an eventual return to normal blood counts and resolution of hepatosplenomegaly. This case of perinatal HHV-6 infection shows that viruses can initially mimic the in vitro culture results found in patients with JMML. It also illustrates that patients suspected of having JMML should be observed if there are no signs of progressive disease and concurrent features suggestive of viral infection."
CD011926,0,14635004,0,"Detection of low copy numbers of HIV-1 proviral DNA in patient PBMCs by a high-input, sequence-capture PCR (Mega-PCR).","An internally controlled high-input PCR method, termed HIV-1 Mega-PCR was developed to lower the detection limit of HIV-1 DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to improve its value as a complementary diagnostic test. It is based on PCR amplification of two target sequences in the gag gene of HIV-1 following the selective capture of the targeted sequence and removal of unselected DNA from up to 500 microg of DNA. Efficient selection and amplification was monitored by inclusion of two mimic plasmids. The method was evaluated with buffy coat cells from healthy blood donors which were spiked with blood from 106 different HIV-1-infected individuals, and with 107 HIV-1 seronegative control buffy coats. All specimens from HIV-infected individuals were positive by a PCR protocol using 1 microg of patient DNA. Amplification of 1 microg DNA of the 106 spiked, diluted samples resulted in 68 double positive, 14 single positive, and 24 double negative reactions. In the Mega-PCR, the average input was 260 +/- 84 microg DNA containing an estimated 1.1 +/- 0.6% of spiked patient DNA. Of the 106 samples tested by Mega-PCR, 102 were positive and three negative. One failed to select the mimic plasmid. Among the 107 negative buffy coat controls, none was false-positive and four exhibited a failure of the internal reaction control. Application of HIV-1 Mega-PCR to clinical specimens from seroreverting newborns of HIV-infected mothers and seroindeterminate, PCR-negative specimens revealed no indication for HIV infection, whereas three samples from confirmed, HIV-1-infected but PCR negative individuals showed evidence of the presence of HIV-1 DNA. Mega-PCR lowers the detection limit of an individual analysis to approximately 0.01 HIV-1 DNA copies/microg of applied DNA and may help to confirm or exclude HIV-1-infection in difficult situations diagnostic."

CD011926,0,24785143,0,[Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV].,"Globally, an estimated 3.3 million children were living with HIV in 2012 (around 1500 in France) In developed countries, the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 has been reduced to less than 1 %, thanks to the large diffusion of antiretroviral drugs given in pregnant women and in HIV-exposed children. The rare cases of HIV-1 MTCT are due to missed opportunities of HIV diagnosis in pregnant women or to late prescription of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Neonatal screening for HIV in exposed newborns is based on repeated HIV RNA and/or DNA PCR, performed at 1-3days, 1, 3 and 6months of age. Even if the health of HIV-exposed children is not a concern in the vast majority of cases, future challenges will imply to study the potential long-term toxicity of ART because of the description of several biological, clinical and imaging alerts."
CD011926,0,10668256,0,[Control of congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in Argentina].,"The vertical transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi has been augmenting its relative importance as vector and transfusion-mediated transmission routes have been, and continue to be, increasingly controlled. The vertical transmission of T. cruzi cannot be prevented; but early detection and treatment of congenital infection achieve cure rates close to 100%. In Argentina, the Subprogram of Control of Pregnant Women examined 58,196 women from 13 provinces in 1997 and found a 9% seropositivity to T. cruzi. In spite of such high maternal prevalence rates of T. cruzi, only a small proportion of live newborns to infected mothers acquires the infection. The probability of vertical transmission was 1.9% (range: 0.1% to 3.5%) in surveys carried out in the '70s, and 2.5% (range: 0.7% to 10.4%) in others conducted in the '70-'80s. Other more recent studies in Argentina estimated the probability of transmission in 2.6%-6.7%, but studies from Paraguay estimated 10.5% by PCR or serodiagnosis. The microhematocrit technique is the recommended parasitologic method to detect congenital infection. Routine serodiagnosis that detects IgG against T. cruzi is only helpful after the newborn reaches 6 months of age. Detection of specific IgM using recombinant antigens and PCR constitute excellent alternatives, but their feasibility from operational and cost-effective viewpoints in affected endemic areas remains to be considered. In a longitudinal project carried out in Maternidad Nuestra Señora de la Merced in the city of Tucumán between 1992-1994, the majority of congenital cases were asymptomatic. They were diagnosed through the microhematocrit technique, but a number of cases could only be detected later as a result of the parasitological and/or serological follow-up. Of a total of 32 newborns infected with T. cruzi who were treated with nifurtimox or benznidazole, 30 had a negative microhematocrit and serodiagnosis between 6 months and 2 years post-treatment. The magnitude of congenital transmission, and its associated morbidity and mortalidad, largely justify the efforts needed to detect T. cruzi infection in the mothers and newborns. This project demonstrated that the transmission of T. cruzi can be successfully controlled at a provincial scale through a specific program inserted in the primary health care system or at the first level of attention. The congenital transmission of T. cruzi clearly represents a public health problem in areas that in the past were of active transmission, even years after being under entomologic surveillance."

In this study, we used PCR for all CPSs and selected protein antigens, multilocus sequencing typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to molecularly characterize 92 clinical isolates identified as nontypeable (NT) by CPS-specific antibody-antigen reactivity. The PCR and MLST were performed on blinded, randomly numbered isolates. All isolates contained the cfb gene coding for CAMP factor. While most (56.5%) contained a single CPS-specific gene, 40 isolates contained either two or three CPS-specific genes. Type V CPS-specific gene was present in 66% of the isolates, and all serotypes except types IV, VII, and VIII were represented. Most (44.5%) of the isolates contained a single protein antigen gene (bca, bac, rib, alp1, or alp3), and the remaining isolates had multiple protein antigen genes. Of the 61 isolates that had the V CPS-specific gene, 48 (78.6%) had the alp3 gene. PFGE analysis classified the isolates into 21 profile groups, while MLST analysis divided the isolates into 16 sequence types. Forty-two (69%) of 61 isolates with the V CPS-specific gene were in PFGE profile group 4; 41 of these 42 were sequence type 1 by MLST. These data shed new light on the antigenic complexity of NT GBS isolates, information that can be valuable in the formulation of an effective GBS vaccine."
CD011926,0,23033270,0,Memory CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells are abundantly present in the gut of newborn infants to facilitate mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1.,"Despite potential clinical importance, target cells for mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 have not yet been identified. Cord blood-derived CD4(+) T cells are largely naive and do not express CCR5, the mandatory coreceptor for transmitted HIV-1 R5 strains in infants. In the present study, we demonstrate that in the human fetal and infant gut mucosa, there is already a large subset of mucosal memory CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells with predominantly a Th1 and Th17 phenotype. Using next-generation sequencing of the TCRβ chain, clonally expanded T cells as a hallmark for memory development predominated in the gut mucosa (30%), whereas few were found in the lymph nodes (1%) and none in cord blood (0%). The gut mucosal fetal and infant CD4(+) T cells were highly susceptible to HIV-1 without any prestimulation; pol proviral DNA levels were similar to infected phytohemagglutinin-stimulated adult PBMCs. In conclusion, in the present study, we show that extensive adaptive immunity is present before birth and the gut mucosa is the preferential site for memory CD4(+) T cells. These CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells in the infant mucosa provide a large pool of susceptible cells for ingested HIV-1 at birth and during breastfeeding, indicating a mucosal route of mother-to-child transmission that can be targeted in prevention strategies."

At least one virus was detected in 436 (38.3%) specimens by FA and in 608 (53.4%) specimens by PCR (P<0.001). Specimen quality was inadequate for FA in 52 (4.6%) specimens; 13 of these (25%) were positive by PCR. In contrast, 18 (1.6%) specimens could not be analyzed by PCR; 1 of these was positive by FA. The number of specimens positive only by PCR among specimens positive by PCR and/or FA was 18 (7.0%) of 257 for RSV, 18 (13.4%) of 134 for FluA, 25 (64.1%) of 39 for PIV1, 8 (88.9%) of 9 for PIV2, 17 (30.1%) of 55 for PIV3, and 101 (76.5%) of 132 for AdV. MPV was detected in 6.6% of all specimens and in 9.5% of the 702 specimens negative by FA. The mean number of virus copies per milliliter in specimens positive by both PCR and FA was significantly higher, at 6.7x10(7), than that in specimens positive only by PCR, at 4.1x10(4) (P<0.001). The PCR assays were significantly more sensitive than FA assays for detecting respiratory viruses, especially parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. Use of real-time PCR to identify viral respiratory pathogens in children will lead to improved diagnosis of respiratory illness."

Producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents around Bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. All routine Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for MBLs, with case details reviewed for the source patients. In total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 Escherichia coli, six Klebsiella pneumoniae, four Klebsiella oxytoca, four Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae and two Morganella morganii, as well as single Citrobacter amalonaticus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia stuartii and Proteus mirabilis isolates. All were PCR-positive for bla(VIM) and 25 were PCR-positive for qnrS; 19 non-K. pneumoniae had bla(SHV) and one had bla(CTX-M-group1); 13 were from 12 LTCF residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. All these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or LTCF stay; only seven had infections due to the MBL producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. Five patients had more than one MBL-producing organism. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related E. coli, whereas pairs of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity.

A new procedure to characterize multiple SNPs in traces of DNA from plasma and old dried blood samples was developed. Six SNPs in the Mannose Binding Lectin 2 (MBL2) gene were chosen as targets for analysis. DNA was extracted from plasma obtained from mothers (n=49) and their neonates (n=49) and from old dried blood samples (n=204). Multiple Real-Time SNP analyses in the MBL2 gene were carried out on all samples. Because of very low DNA concentrations in most of the samples, a pre-amplification step was utilized. It was possible to analyze all plasma samples (n=98), including those with very low cell numbers (n=21) and 93% of the old dried blood samples (n=189). Results obtained from pre-amplified samples were in full agreement with neat samples. All possible SNP alleles were present in our population. The frequencies of the different alleles from both plasma and dried blood samples (n=287) were in agreement with earlier studies of the Caucasian population. In conclusion, amplification prior to Real-Time PCR SNP analysis is a convenient, cost effective and useful method to significantly improve the reliable SNP detection in specimens containing very low concentrations or poor quality DNA from suboptimal sources."

CD011926,0,11519286,0,Clinical manifestations and management of pediatric HIV infection.,"HIV infection has emerged as a colossal problem with epidemic proportions. According to an estimate from UNAIDS about 36.1 million people all over the world are infected at present. In India about 3.5 million people are infected. The infection has evolved into phase II process of disease evolution, spreading from high-risk population to the general population. The antenatal HIV seropositivity has shown a steady increase from 0.1% to 2% in some tertiary care hospitals in Mumbai. Pediatric HIV infection presents with diverse clinical manifestations. In developing countries like India, diagnosis of infection during first year of life in perinatally exposed infants poses a problem due to lack of easy accessibility and increased cost of diagnostic facilities like HIV-PCR, CD4/CD8 counts and viral cultures. Moreover, lack of adequate drugs and exorbitant cost of sustaining antiretroviral therapy complicates the management issues. An assortment of antiretovirals is available in USA and other developed countries. In India drugs like zidovudine, lamivudine, stavudine, nevirapine and indinavir are available and are used in symptomatic patients. CDC has defined definite treatment guidelines for pediatric population recently. These guidelines need to be modified in our set up. At the present juncture in India the emphasis remains on the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections like tuberculosis and pneumocystis carinii and on prevention of perinatal transmission with zidovudine.

CD011926,0,21455476,0,Comparison of DNA extraction methods from small samples of newborn screening cards suitable for retrospective perinatal viral research.,"Reliable detection of viral DNA in stored newborn screening cards (NSC) would give important insight into possible silent infection during pregnancy and around birth. We sought a DNA extraction method with sufficient sensitivity to detect low copy numbers of viral DNA from small punch samples of NSC. Blank NSC were spotted with seronegative EDTA-blood and seropositive EBV EDTA-blood. DNA was extracted with commercial and noncommercial DNA extraction methods and quantified on a spectrofluorometer using a PicoGreen dsDNA quantification kit. Serial dilutions of purified viral DNA controls determined the sensitivity of the amplification protocol, and seropositive EBV EDTA-blood amplified by nested PCR (nPCR) validated the DNA extraction methods. There were considerable differences between the commercial and noncommercial DNA extraction methods (P=0.014; P=0.016). Commercial kits compared favorably, but the QIamp DNA micro kit with an added forensic filter step was marginally more sensitive. The mean DNA yield from this method was 3 ng/μl. The limit of detection was 10 viral genome copies in a 50-μl reaction. EBV nPCR detection in neat and 1:10 diluted DNA extracts could be replicated reliably. We conclude that the QIamp Micro DNA extraction method with the added forensic spin-filter step was suitable for retrospective DNA viral assays from NSC."

CD011926,0,1449788,0,Perinatal HIV transmission facts and controversies.,"In 1992, HIV infection in children is essentially due to vertical or perinatal transmission, i.e. from the mother to the fetus and neonates. This is a particularly serious public-health problem in Africa where the percentage of infected women of child bearing age is as high as 20% in some suburban areas. During the last few years, three important points have been established. (i) In Europe and North America, the rate of perinatal transmission is between 15 and 25% and appears to have remained relatively stable with time in various prospective cohorts. (ii) Considerable efforts have been directed at defining the optimal methods for early diagnosis of HIV infection in the infants. At present viral cultures and gene amplification of HIV DNA by polymerase chain reaction are the most promising procedures for early diagnosis within the first 6 months of life. (iii) Finally, the course of the disease in the infected infant has been well characterised, it takes two main forms--that of an early and severe disease or that of a slowly progressive infection: In addition, follow-up is now sufficient to confirm that children with negative tests at 15 months are indeed uninfected. However, knowledge is lacking in a number of essential areas. These include the exact timing of transmission (in utero, during delivery or post-partum), the relative frequency of transmission during each period, the mechanism(s) involved (particularly the role of the placenta), and, finally, the influence of maternal, fetal and viral factors. Answers must be found rapidly in order to develop preventive therapy, to identify women who may have an increased risk of transmitting the virus, to develop a reliable antenatal diagnostic test and, finally, to be in a better position to inform HIV-seropositive women of the relative risks."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate, whether prenatal B19 infection could still be indirectly correlated with the development of childhood ALL."

CD011926,0,21353958,0,Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.,"This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin."
CD011926,0,24819262,0,[Determination of the frequency of human bocavirus and other respiratory viruses among 0-2 years age group children diagnosed as acute bronchiolitis].,"Acute bronchiolitis, mostly seen in infants and younger children, is a lower respiratory tract infection frequently caused by viral agents. We aimed to determine the frequency of a broad panel of respiratory viruses including human bocavirus (HBoV) and to assess the clinical characteristics of acute bronchiolitis in a group of children under 24 months of age. A total of 62 children (45 male, 17 female; age range: 0-2 years) with the initial diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis and 33 healthy children (21 male, 12 female; age range: 0-2 years) as control group who were admitted to the Pediatrics Department of Mersin University Hospital, southern Turkey, from January to July 2010 were included in the study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from the study groups and the detection of respiratory viruses [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A & B; rhinovirus (RV); human metapneumovirus (hMPV) A & B; influenza virus type A [H1N1, H3N2, H1N1v], B & C; parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1, 2, 3 & 4A/B; adenovirus (AdV); HBoV; coronavirus (CoV 229E); enterovirus (EV)], were performed by using a commercial system namely CLART®Pneumovir (Clinical Array Technology, Genomica, Spain) based on the principle of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) and DNA microarray. Demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings of the patients, treatment protocols and the relationship between the length of hospitalization and the viral agents determined were also evaluated. Of the 62 samples collected from bronchiolitis cases, at least one virus was detected in 52 (83.9%) and viral co-infections were detected in 31 (50%) of them. Including the co-infections, RSV was the most commonly identified virus (n= 21; 33.9%), followed by influenza A [H1N1] (n= 18; 29%), RV (n= 18; 29%), hMPV (n= 13; 21%), PIV (n= 10; 16.1%), AdV (n= 5; 8%), HBoV (n= 3; 4.8%) and EV (n= 1; 1.6%). Of the 33 samples from healthy children, at least one virus was detected in 21 (63.6%) and viral co-infections were detected in seven (21.2%) samples. Including the co-infections, the most commonly detected virus was RV (n= 10; 30.3%), followed by influenza A [H1N1] (n= 6; 18.1%), AdV (n= 6; 18.1%), RSV (n= 4; 12.1%) and PIV (n= 3; 9%), however HBoV and hMPV were not detected in the control group. The differences of demographic features (age, gender, history of atopy, exposure of smoking, length of breast-feeding, presence of school-age sibling) and frequency of virus detection (83.9% and 63.6%, respectively) between the patient and control groups were not statistically significant (p> 0.05). The most common complaints of patients on admission were cough (100%), runny nose (82.3%) and respiratory difficulty (71%), whereas fever was present in 21 (33.9%) patients. The most common findings on physical examination were prolonged expirium (98.4%), rhonchi (98.4%), rales (80.6%), tachypnea (71%) and tachycardia (67.7%). Pulmonary graphies revealed that diffuse air trappings were more common in virus-associated bronchiolitis (36/52; 69.2%) cases, on the other hand infiltrations were more common (6/10; 60%) in patients who were virus-negative (p< 0.05). The demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings, clinical severity scores, hospitalization rates and duration of hospitalizations in bronchiolitis cases did not show statistically significant differences between the viral agents (p> 0.05 for each parameter). However the rates of antibiotic and steroid use in hospitalized patients (24/34 and 5/34, respectively) were significantly higher than those of outpatients (7/28 and 0/28, respectively) (p= 0.001 and p= 0.03). Our data indicated a high rate (~84%) of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the Mersin province and the detection of hMPV (21%) and HBoV (4.8%) only in the patient group encouraged their roles in the etiology of acute brochiolitis. It was concluded that viral etiology should be investigated in selected cases to prevent unnecessary antibiotic treatment and to initiate appropriate antiviral therapy when necessary."

However, its role in the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus is still unclear. We evaluated the prevalence of PVL-coding genes in methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) isolates that cause infections in pediatric patients in the city of Cartagena, Colombia. We obtained S. aureus isolates from patients at the Napoleon Franco Pareja Children's Hospital in Cartagena. Then, we evaluated the presence of the nuc, mecA, and PVL genes in these isolates by multiplex PCR and determined the antibiotic susceptibility profiles using CLSI standards. We further correlated methicillin susceptibility and the presence of PVL genes with clinical variables. Overall PVL prevalence in S. aureus isolates was 73.91%, with a frequency of 80.92% among MRSA isolates and 67.59% among MSSA. We found a correlation between erythromycin resistance and lack of PVL and found that PVL+ cases were more common in older patients. We found a high PVL prevalence in both MRSA and MSSA isolates, in concordance with previous regional reports."

Environmental sampling was performed simultaneously. Fifty-two isolates were recovered from 200 neonates (stool, blood) and 14 strains were isolated from the neonatal environment. An epidemiological study based on the typing of 36 Enterobacter cloacae isolates was carried out using antibiotyping, biotyping and ribotyping methods. The isolates selected were from 21 neonates (24 isolates), the neonatal ward environment (8 isolates) and from other wards (4 isolates). Thirty-two isolates had the same antibiotic resistance pattern, corresponding to a derepressed cephalosporinase and resistance to the following aminoglycosides: kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin. No predominant biotyping pattern could be established. Ribotyping done with two endonucleases (EcoRI and BamHI) showed 28 Enterobacter cloacae isolates to have a single pattern. Ribotyping was the most discriminating method used in this study, permitting identification of cross-contamination with Enterobacter cloacae in the paediatric ward."

Even though usually associated with non-specific febrile illness, they are the most common cause of viral meningitis and pose a serious public-health problem, especially during outbreaks. Rapid detection and identification of HEV serotypes in clinical specimens are important in appropriate patient management and epidemiological investigation. A 5 year study (2003-2007) of clinical specimens from patients with viral meningitis and/or symptoms of enteroviral infection was carried out in Cyprus to determine the underlying enteroviral aetiology. Reverse transcription, followed by a sequential PCR strategy targeting the 5' non-coding region and VP1 region, was used for typing the isolated enteroviruses. The serotype of each isolate was determined by blast search of the VP1 amplicon sequence against GenBank. Clinical specimens from a total of 146 patients were diagnosed as enterovirus-positive. Twenty-two different serotypes were identified. The main strains identified were echovirus 18 and echovirus 30, followed by coxsackievirus B5, echovirus 9, echovirus 6, coxsackievirus A10 and coxsackievirus B2. However, rapid changes in serotype frequency and diversity were observed over time. Serotype distribution corresponded essentially with observations reported from other European countries in the same period. The present report demonstrates the epidemiology of enteroviruses in Cyprus from 2003 to 2007."
CD011926,0,10500209,0,Detection of human neurotropic JC virus DNA sequence and expression of the viral oncogenic protein in pediatric medulloblastomas.,"Medulloblastoma represents greater than 25% of childhood intracranial neoplasms and is considered a highly malignant tumor. This tumor, which arises predominantly in the cerebellar vermis, preferentially affects children between the ages of 5 and 15. Although the etiology of medulloblastomas in humans remains unknown, results from several experiments have indicated that the human neurotropic JC virus (JCV) is able to induce cerebellar neoplasms in rodents that exhibit a phenotype similar to that of human medulloblastomas. JCV is a polyomavirus that is widespread in the human population, with infection occurring most frequently in early childhood. In this study, we have examined the possible association of JCV with human medulloblastomas. By using PCR techniques we demonstrate that 11 of 23 samples of tumor tissue contain DNA sequences corresponding to three different regions of the JCV genome. More importantly, we demonstrate the presence of DNA sequences encoding the N- and C-terminal regions of the JCV oncogenic protein, T antigen, in 11 of 23 samples and the production of T antigen in the nuclei of 4 samples of tumor tissue. These observations provide evidence for a possible association of JCV with human medulloblastomas."

Seven patients died (including four intrauterine deaths) and five survived. On histological examination, the characteristic inclusion bodies were detected in only three placentas, and villitis with plasma cell infiltration was seen in eight placentas. Immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody against CMV improved the sensitivity of CMV deletion (10 cases were positive). With the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) following the extraction of DNA from formaldehyde-fixed placenta samples, CMV DNA was detected in seven cases. All 12 subjects were diagnosed with CMV infection by additional Southern blot analysis after the PCR. CMV DNA was also detected by an in situ hybridization method in all cases. With current molecular biological techniques the placenta can be reliably used for the diagnosis of congenital CMV infection."

CD011926,0,11980958,0,Real-time PCR quantification of human cytomegalovirus DNA in amniotic fluid samples from mothers with primary infection.,"A real-time PCR assay was developed to quantify human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA in amniotic fluid (AF) samples collected from 30 pregnant women with primary HCMV infection as detected either from HCMV-immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroconversion or by the presence of HCMV-specific IgG and IgM associated with a low IgG avidity. Clinical information available for each case included ultrasonographic examination and fetal or newborn outcome. HCMV infection of fetuses or newborns was confirmed for the 30 studied cases. AF samples were subdivided into three groups. In group A (n = 13), fetuses presented major ultrasound abnormalities, and pregnancy was terminated. In group B (n = 13), fetuses had normal ultrasound findings, the pregnancy went to term, and the newborns were asymptomatic at birth. In group C (n = 4), fetuses had no or minor ultrasonographic signs, and pregnancy was terminated. The HCMV DNA load values in AF samples were significantly higher in group A (median, 2.8 x 10(5) genome equivalents [GE]/ml) than in group B (median, 8 x 10(3) GE/ml) (P = 0.014).

The incidence of HuCV infection in South Africa is unknown. Stool specimens from 1,296 South African patients with sporadic gastroenteritis were screened for the presence of HuCVs using electron microscopy, recombinant enzyme immunoassays for Norwalk (NV) and Mexican (MX) viruses, and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR products were sequenced to ascertain which HuCV genogroups were present. HuCVs were detected in 43/1,296 (3.3%) specimens examined, with RT-PCR proving to be the most sensitive detection method. Genetic analysis of the isolates indicated that 81% were Snow Mountain Agent, or MX-like; 8% were NV-like; and 11% were HuCV/Sapporo-like. This study indicates that a combination of assays is needed for the accurate detection of HuCVs. Comparative data on hospitalised patients showed that the incidence of rotavirus infection was approximately ten times greater than that of HuCV infection."

Infectious HIV was detected at some time during pregnancy in 59% of women from plasma and in 83% from either peripheral blood mononuclear cells or plasma. HIV was not isolated from any of the newborn babies (0/27) at birth. The mothers had a significantly higher frequency of viraemia during pregnancy than their children had by 6 months of age (p = 0.002); by this time HIV was recovered from 5 (26%) of 19 infants. HIV was not detected by virus isolation, in-situ hybridisation, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 10 fetuses; the other 2 fetuses were positive either by in-situ hybridisation or by PCR but neither result could be confirmed in a second organ or by the other methods of detection. The findings show that there is no consistent spread of HIV across the placenta during maternal viraemia, and indicate that in most cases transmission occurs close to or at delivery."

The conventional method of cell culture in four different cell lines was initially used for the isolation of enteroviruses. The results showed a cytopathic effect (CPE) in all cases after two, or even more successive passages in only one cell line (RD), although a less-than-satisfactory CPE was obtained in many cases. Seroneutralization with RIVM mixed hyperimmune antisera followed and the isolates were typed as Coxsackie B viruses. The method of RT-PCR with enterovirus-specific primers targeted to the highly conserved 5'-UTR of the genome was initially used for the detection of enteroviruses from the inoculated cell cultures. A positive RT-PCR result was obtained for all of the clinical samples rapidly and accurately and the isolates were further characterized with the aid of Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of the amplicons. The RFLP analysis showed first of all that the isolates had an identical restriction pattern with Coxsackie B5 Faulkner reference strain with 4 out of 5 restriction enzymes and secondly, both RFLP and SSCP analysis indicated the epidemiological association of the isolates.

Children under 2 years of age admitted with a lower respiratory tract infection in three hospitals in northern Germany were included (one tertiary and two secondary centers). Cases were children tested positive for RSV by multiplex RT-PCR. One control group consisted of children tested negative for RSV in the multiplex-RT-PCR and a second control group consisted of patients in whom no PCR was done. A weighted backward stepwise logistic regression model was applied for multivariate analysis. RSV-etiology could be predicted with a sensitivity of 72.8% and a specificity of 73.2%. Young age, disease entity--pneumonia or bronchiolitis, center, intercostal retractions, absence of an underlying condition, low level of C-reactive protein, short duration of symptoms (all on admission), prematurity and epidemiologic year were predictive; anatomical infiltrates and wheezing were not. Pathogen specific diagnosis is necessary for individual therapy, allocation in observational studies or treatment trials and for surveillance of airway infections in children, since the positive predictive value is too low for an accurate diagnosis and decision making. Multivariate techniques are effective tools in complex clinical research for deconfounding."

A questionnaire-based surveillance was undertaken among eight laboratories participating in DEVANI and six laboratories not participating in DEVANI from 13 countries in order to assess their current microbiological procedures for GBS screening, diagnosis, and typing. GBS strains from three EQA distributions were characterized using molecular and serological methods based on GBS capsular polysaccharide typing. Participants were asked to test the first distribution using their current serotyping and genotyping methods. The Strep-B-Latex agglutination method was the most widely used method, with a typeability value of >90%. A multiplex PCR assay for GBS capsular gene typing was also used by 2 of 14 centers, which achieved a typeability value of 93%; this assay detected only 9 of 10 GBS capsular polysaccharide genes. From the second and third EQA studies, standardized protocols were prepared for serological and molecular typing of GBS strains based on the Strep-B-Latex agglutination method and a novel multiplex PCR assay that detected all 10 GBS capsular types (Ia to IX). These standardized protocols are being used by many European laboratories, and as the use of these methods increases, it is imperative to continuously improve and assess laboratory performance and offer training to any laboratories that have technical difficulties."

CD011926,0,25373147,0,Large-scale genomic sequencing of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli strains.,"Large-scale bacterial genome sequencing efforts to date have provided limited information on the most prevalent category of disease: sporadically acquired infections caused by common pathogenic bacteria. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing and de novo assembly of 312 blood- or urine-derived isolates of extraintestinal pathogenic (ExPEC) Escherichia coli, a common agent of sepsis and community-acquired urinary tract infections, obtained during the course of routine clinical care at a single institution. We find that ExPEC E. coli are highly genomically heterogeneous, consistent with pan-genome analyses encompassing the larger species. Investigation of differential virulence factor content and antibiotic resistance phenotypes reveals markedly different profiles among lineages and among strains infecting different body sites. We use high-resolution molecular epidemiology to explore the dynamics of infections at the level of individual patients, including identification of possible person-to-person transmission. Notably, a limited number of discrete lineages caused the majority of bloodstream infections, including one subclone (ST131-H30) responsible for 28% of bacteremic E. coli infections over a 3-yr period. We additionally use a microbial genome-wide-association study (GWAS) approach to identify individual genes responsible for antibiotic resistance, successfully recovering known genes but notably not identifying any novel factors. We anticipate that in the near future, whole-genome sequencing of microorganisms associated with clinical disease will become routine. Our study reveals what kind of information can be obtained from sequencing clinical isolates on a large scale, even well-characterized organisms such as E. coli, and provides insight into how this information might be utilized in a healthcare setting."

We demonstrate how, in this unique circumstance, EM can complement or even supersede immunohistochemistry (IHC) and culture studies. Cases with suspected viral inclusions followed by EM-lift were collected over 25 years; hematoxylin and eosin, IHC, and culture findings were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry results were not available in 15 of the 30 samples found; tissue blocks were obtained in 6 of the samples, and additional IHC studies were performed. Nine cases had viral cultures. The usual clinical question was ""rejection versus infection"" in a transplant setting (56%). The gastrointestinal tract/liver was most frequently sampled (76%). The EM-lift technique confirmed virus in 18 cases, including adenovirus (58%), cytomegalovirus, herpes, papillomavirus, and parvovirus. Twenty-one cases had informative EM but IHC findings were positive in 8. Both EM-lift and IHC findings were positive in 5 cases and negative in 8 cases. All IHC-positive cases were positive by EM-lift. Of the 6 cases with new IHC, 2 negative cases stained with a newer antibody (EM-positive for adenovirus) and 4 remained negative. Nine had culture findings; 1 was positive, with positive EM-lift. Eight were culture-negative; 4 of these were EM-positive. We conclude that in clinical settings in which virus identification is critical and infection is not otherwise confirmed, the lift technique can be more sensitive than IHC (missed inclusions) and culture studies (often not done) or polymerase chain reaction test, which can be overly sensitive."

Among norovirus strains, genotype GG II/4 was most common (99/146), followed by GG II/3 (22/146), GG II/5 (8/146), and 2 strains of each of GG II/6, GG II/7, GG II/8, and GG I/2, the other 9 strains of NV GG II were unique, potentially belonging to new genotypes. These results plus the epidemiology data suggested that HuCVs are an important cause of severe diarrhea in Chinese children that were under reported due to a lack of a simple diagnostic assay. The finding of the potential new genotypes indicates that the current assays need to be improved for broader detection and besides, a continual surveillance for better understanding the epidemiology the disease burden and the searching for new strains of HuCVs is necessary."
CD011926,0,17297874,0,[Etiology of pulmonary diseases in children in Khabarovsk Region].,"Microflora of upper respiratory tract in 658 children aged 1 month - 17 years hospitalized with acute pneumonia (AP), acute bronchitis (AB), recurrent obstructive bronchitis (ROB), malformation of lungs (ML) and broncho-alveolar dysplasia (BALD) were studied. Carriage rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (up to 95%) and Haemophilus influenzae (up to 89%) in 240 children attending daycare centers and schools were determined. Etiology of infectious process was ascertained in 40% of cases. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 45% of acute cases (AP and AB) and in 25% of chronic cases (BALD). H. influenzae was isolated in 8 - 12% of acute cases and in 32% of chronic cases. In 23 - 29% of all cases of pulmonary pathology in children persistence of Enterococcus faecium was determined. There were 13 different serotypes among isolated pneumococci. In patients with pneumonia the rate of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae DNA fragments by PCR was significantly higher compared with rate of their isolation from sputum."

CD011926,0,17209305,0,Estimation of the rate of mother to child transmission of HIV in Nigeria.,"Definitive diagnosis of HIV infection in infants < 18 months of age who were born to HIV-infected mothers is still posing some difficulty in Nigeria and other developing countries. Within this age definitive diagnosis can only be carried out by antigen based techniques which are indeed not available in these developing countries. This has resulted in the absence of authoritative data on the rate of mother-to-child transmission in these countries. Nigeria inclusive. The present pilot study was therefore carried out to generate some information on the rate of mother to child transmission in Nigeria using the PCR technique. Plasma samples were obtained from 68 children of both sexes less than 18 months of age and who were born to HIV infected mothers. The samples were collected from two pediatric departments. in Lagos and in Benin. The presence of HIV 1 RNA in each of the samples. was determined using the Amplicor Monitor V 1.5 technique (Roche Diagnostics). Data showed that HIV-1 RNA was detected in 15 of the 68 samples tested. This gave an HIV-1 RNA detection rate of 22%. Among women who had some intervention, the rate of transmission of infection was 11% while the rate among those without intervention was 30%. The 22% transmission rate recorded in this study is close to the range of 25 to 35% that has been reported in several developed and a few developing countries. A multicenter nationwide study will still be needed to determine the national mother to child transmission rate in Nigeria."
CD011926,0,25070008,0,Comparison of a new transport medium with universal transport medium at a tropical field site.,"Limited data are available in rural Honduran settings describing the etiology of respiratory infections, partially due to limited specimen transport. A new molecular transport media (MTM) preserves released nucleic acid at ambient temperature for later detection. Prospective surveillance was conducted in a Honduran clinic to identify 233 children less than 5 years of age presenting with respiratory symptoms. We obtained 2 nasopharyngeal samples and stored 1 in PrimeStore® MTM at room temperature and 1 in universal transport media (UTM) at -80 °C. The specimens were then transported to Cincinnati Children's Hospital and tested for 16 respiratory viruses using a multiplex PCR panel. The 2 specimen collection systems were similar for detecting the 4 most common viruses: influenza (Kappa = 0.7676, P < 0.0001), human metapneumovirus (Kappa = 0.8770, P < 0.0001), respiratory syncytial virus (Kappa = 0.6849, P < 0.0001), and parainfluenza (Kappa = 0.8796, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that clinical specimens transported via PrimeStore® MTM and UTM yield similar viral multiplex PCR results."

CD011926,0,2360968,0,Relevance of hepatitis B DNA detection in patient's serum.,"Detection of HBV-DNA showed a satisfactory sensitivity (6 pg/ml) and high specificity: 15 patients with hepatitis A, 6 with CMV, 7 with EBV infection, 81 with hepatitis NANB as well as 174 persons with isolated HBc antibodies and 9 hepatitis B vaccinees gave negative results. However, out of 118 persons with a history of hepatitis B (HBs and HBc antibodies positive), one repeatedly had a positive result. We followed 58 patients with chronic hepatitis B, 25 healthy antigen carries, and 16 HBV-infected dialysis patients over an extended period with multiple blood sampling. Most of those patients showed changes of detectability of HBV-DNA. Typically, periods with positive DNA tests were followed by intervals with negative tests which could last for up to a few years. 75% of dialysis patients were positive in all sera available, while 48% of healthy antigen carriers were consistently negative. Additionally, 9 patients with a history of recent hepatitis B and a positive HBs antibody test as well as 4 patients with simultaneous infection by A and B were tested for HBV-DNA. In none of these two groups, a variation from the pattern usually found in hepatitis B was established. A case of intrauterine infection with hepatitis B virus is reported. Because the blood of the mother was free from HBV-DNA and HBe antigen at delivery and because the hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis failed in the child who developed HBs antigen very soon after delivery, it has been concluded that the child was infected in utero. The highest values of HBV-DNA determined quantitatively were found in dialysis patients which explains the high risk of acquiring hepatitis B in the dialysis unit. The results from earlier studies on the prognostic relevance of HBV-DNA and the risk of medical personnel as a source of infection with hepatitis B are discussed briefly."
CD011926,0,16585603,0,A severe form of human combined immunodeficiency due to mutations in DNA ligase IV.,"DNA ligase IV (LigIV) deficiency was identified as the molecular basis for a severe form of combined immunodeficiency in two microcephalic siblings with cellular radiosensitivity. In one patient the diagnosis was made directly after birth, allowing analysis of the role of LigIV in the development of specific immune cells. Absolute numbers of B cells were reduced 100-fold and alphabeta T cells 10-fold, whereas gammadelta T cells were normal. Spectratyping of all three cell populations showed a diverse repertoire, but sequencing of IgH V(D)J junctions revealed shorter CDR3 regions due to more extensive nucleotide deletions among D and J elements and fewer N nucleotide insertions. Clonal restriction of IgG-expressing, but not IgM-expressing, B cells and the lack of primary and secondary lymph node follicles indicated impaired class switch recombination. Observations in the older sibling showed that this rudimentary immune system was able to mount specific responses to infection. However, partial Ab responses and extensive amplification of gammadelta T cells could not prevent a life-threatening course of viral and bacterial infections, the development of an EBV-induced lymphoma, and immune dysregulation reflected by severe autoimmune cytopenia. Impaired generation of immune diversity under conditions of limited LigIV activity can cause a human SCID variant with a characteristic immunological phenotype."
CD011926,0,19238467,0,New 16-plex PCR method for rapid detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli directly from stool samples.,"A rapid 16-plex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) suitable for routine diagnostics of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (EHEC, EIEC, EAEC, ETEC, and EPEC) was developed, validated with control strains, and tested with 250 diarrhoeal stool samples. The specificity was 100% when tested with 289 control bacterial strains, and the analytical sensitivity of automated DNA extraction directly from stool samples was made by boiling the bacterial culture (10(4)-10(5) colony forming units/ml). The assay design starting directly from extraction of stool DNA allowed same day analysis without compromising sensitivity and specificity, which makes it superior compared to PCR after culturing the bacteria. The 16-plex PCR method demonstrated high prevalence of diarrheagenic E. coli in stool samples of patients returning from abroad (39.0%) in contrast to the patients with no travel history (8.7%; p < 0.001). The high prevalence of diarrheagenic E. coli suggests that their screening should be part of normal diarrhoea diagnostics, at least in the leading diagnostic laboratories."

CD011926,0,7876894,0,Multicystic encephalopathy: review of eight cases with etiologic considerations.,"Multicystic encephalomalacia (MCE) is a rare lesion that arises during the perinatal period. Although hypoxic-ischemic insults may be responsible for this lesion, recent evidence suggests that herpesviruses may represent another etiologic agent. To elucidate the pathogenesis of MCE, eight cases collected over a 34-year period were evaluated for destructive lesions in gray and white matter. Immunocytochemical methods, in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology were employed to search for herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV1 and HSV2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and JC variant of papovavirus (JCV). Review of the clinical histories revealed that there had been a complicated labor and delivery in 6/7 cases. Neuropathological lesions consisted of extensive tissue destruction, neuronal loss and gliosis in hemispheric white matter, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum and brainstem tegmentum. Only one case showed evidence of latent HSV infection by PCR. CMV, VZV, JCV and EBV were not detected. Arteriopathy was noted in one case. The widespread nature of the lesions and their association with perinatal ischemia suggest that severe hypoxia may be the more common etiology of MCE. Term infants appear especially susceptible to this type of cerebral damage."
CD011926,0,8896503,0,Characterization of a nosocomial outbreak involving an epidemic plasmid encoding for TEM-27 in Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Othmarschen.,"A ceftazidime-resistant Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Othmarschen strain, harboring the plasmid-mediated new extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-27, was involved in a nosocomial outbreak (8 patients) at the Pediatric Cardiology Department of the Ramón y Cajal Hospital in Madrid. Genomic DNA polymorphism analysis, using an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction, demonstrated the clonal nature of all Salmonella isolates. The plasmid encoding TEM-27 (pJMM1) was characterized by EcoRI, SacI, and BglI restriction. An identical restriction pattern was found in plasmid from all S. enterica strains. Possible in vivo intergeneric plasmid spread was suggested by the identification of an identical plasmid in Escherichia coli RYC5H and Enterobacter cloacae RYC39737 strains isolated during the outbreak. Results indicate that this outbreak involved dissemination of a single ceftazidime-resistant Salmonella strain and the spread of a single TEM-27-encoding plasmid among different Enterobacteriaceae."
CD011926,0,20699512,0,Phenotypic and molecular characterization of clinically isolated Escherichia coli.,"All diarrheagenic Escherichia coli carry at least one virulence-related property. Stool samples from 244 patients having acute or persistent diarrhea received after the exclusion of routine enteropathogens were investigated. Purely or predominantly isolated E. coli (n = 100) were subjected to serotyping, of which only 25 were typable. They belonged to 14 different O-serogroups comprising 5 O153, 4 O102, 3 O25, 2 each of O130 and O169, and 1 each of O1, O8, O15, O37, O86, O101, O127, O143, and O160. The typable E. coli isolates along with 5 other untypable isolates were investigated for molecular markers, such as intimin (eae), enterohemolysin (EhlyA), a-hemolysin, heat-labile enterotoxins (LT), heat-stable enterotoxins (STa), verotoxins (VT1 and VT2), invasivity (ial), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) gene (EAGG), and enterotoxin (EAST). Two of the isolates (O153 and O86) were positive for enterohemolysin phenotypically and 5 for beta-hemolysin both phenotypically and genotypically. Interestingly, 16.6% of the randomly isolated E. coli were O153, a serogroup common in cattle, and 10% belonged to EAEC pathotype of which two-thirds had the EAST gene, which is quite frequent in these strains. Additionally, there was one strain (O153) that was positive for EAST only. Between the two 0130:H6 strains isolated, one belonged to EAEC serogroup. None of the E. coli isolated were positive for verotoxins, eae, LT1, STa, and ial. Data obtained emphasize the need for additional research into the role of eae gene and other putative factors affecting the virulence of diarrheagenic E. coli in India."
CD011926,0,8327780,0,rRNA gene restriction patterns as an epidemiological marker in nosocomial outbreaks of Staphylococcus aureus infections.,"rRNA gene restriction patterns (ribotyping) were compared with phage typing, serotyping, enterotoxins and exfoliatin production in the analysis of 26 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from two different nosocomial outbreaks. Total DNA was cleaved by EcoRI restriction endonuclease. After agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern transfer, the hybridization of the membranes was done with radiolabelled 16S rRNA gene from Bacillus subtilis inserted into a plasmid vector. Six to 13 fragments were visualized. A core of common fragments was discerned for all strains tested. A full correlation between ribotyping and conventional markers was observed in only one of the outbreaks studied. In both outbreaks, ribotyping proved helpful in characterizing otherwise untypable strains."

CD011926,0,1297002,0,High prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in aborigines in Taiwan.,"In Taiwan, the epidemiological status of HCV infection is similar to those observed in other areas of the world, with 1.0% prevalence among adult volunteer blood donors and high prevalences among the high risk groups, by the detection of anti-HCV with synthetic peptide antigens. However, unusually high prevalences, 35.1%, 15.8% and 14.2%, were observed among adult populations in three of the five aboriginal communities. No difference in sex specificity was noted. In 37 (75.0%) of the 48 anti-HCV-positive cases, HCV-RNA was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. None of such particular risk factors as tattooing, sexual promiscuity, operation, blood transfusion, nor intravenous drug abuse could be accounted for this high prevalence of HCV infection. No helpful supporting evidence for ethnic specificity was noted, either. Although a possible sexual transmission between spouses was observed, it is unlikely to be the main cause of the high prevalence in these aboriginal communities. We conclude that the unusually high prevalence of HCV infection observed in some aboriginal communities in Taiwan could be ascribed to poor anti-septic medical practice derived from insufficiency of medical personnel and facilities in these communities as compared with the other regions in Taiwan at the time before twenty years ago."

CD011926,0,20561238,0,Changes in helper lymphocyte chemokine receptor expression and elevation of IP-10 during acute respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants.,"It is known that lymphopenia caused by apoptosis may occur during severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. However, further evidence about how T-cell subsets may be affected in infants during severe RSV bronchiolitis is needed to understand the mechanisms through which immunological memory may be altered. There is increasingly convincing evidence that RSV may be associated with the development of atopy and asthma. Surrogates of Th1, Th2 and regulatory T-lymphocyte populations were measured in blood from children with acute RSV bronchiolitis and in convalescence using the cell surface receptors CXCR3, CCR4 and CD25, respectively. Samples were also obtained from healthy age-matched controls. Plasma levels of the chemokines interferon-γ inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), which are known ligands for CXCR3 and CCR4, were also measured. Free plasma DNA was measured using quantitative PCR. CXCR3-positive cells were significantly decreased during acute infection (p = 0.013), while CCR4 and CD25 T-cell populations were unchanged. Plasma levels of IP-10 were markedly elevated in acute infection (p = 0.001). Convalescent samples were not significantly different to control samples for lymphocyte phenotypes or plasma chemokines. Elevated free plasma DNA was detected during acute infection compared with convalescence and controls. A profound reduction in the Th1, but not Th2, and CD25-positive lymphocyte populations associated with exaggerated IP-10 production occurs in severe RSV bronchiolitis. Free DNA is detectable in plasma. This may allow significant alterations in the generation of T-cell memory."
CD011926,0,25039903,0,"Enterovirus infections in England and Wales, 2000-2011: the impact of increased molecular diagnostics.","There have recently been significant changes in diagnostic practices for detecting enterovirus (EV) infections across England and Wales. Reports of laboratory-confirmed EV infections submitted by National Health Service (NHS) hospital laboratories to Public Health England (PHE) over a 12-year period (2000-2011) were analysed. Additionally, the PHE Virus Reference Department (VRD) electronic database containing molecular typing data from 2004 onwards was interrogated. Of the 13,901 reports, there was a decline from a peak of 2254 in 2001 to 589 in 2006, and then an increase year-on-year to 1634 in 2011. This increase coincided with increasing PCR-based laboratory diagnosis, which accounted for 36% of reported cases in 2000 and 92% in 2011. The estimated annual incidence in 2011 was 3.9/100,000 overall and 238/100,000 in those aged <3 months, who accounted for almost one-quarter of reported cases (n = 2993, 23%). During 2004-2011, 2770 strains were submitted for molecular typing to the VRD, who found no evidence for a predominance of any particular strain. Thus, the recent increase in reported cases closely reflects the increase in PCR testing by NHS hospitals, but is associated with a lower proportion of samples being submitted for molecular typing. The high EV rate in young infants merits further investigation to inform evidence-based management guidance."

Without therapy FHL is invariably fatal, but successful therapy, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT), has been presented. To clarify the outcome of HLH in a developing country, with regard to clinical, laboratory, and genetic features, a nationwide study on all patients diagnosed with HLH in Oman during the 5-year period 1997-2001 was performed. In 5 patients and their families, mutational analysis was made. Thirteen patients with HLH were identified, 5 of whom had clinical manifestations of central nervous system involvement at presentation. In none of the patients could an infectious cause be identified. Ten children were referred late in the disease course, and the concern about starting chemotherapy before exclusion of an acute viral infection resulted in delayed treatment in some patients. Two children were started early on the HLH-94-therapy followed by successful BMT in one child. In the successfully transplanted child, the response to intrathecal hydrocortisone appeared to be better than standard therapy with intrathecal methotrexate. Finally, a novel missense mutation in the perforin gene was identified in 2 patients and their family members, causing a transition of proline to threonine at codon 89. Early diagnosis and treatment is important to improve outcome. Intrathecal corticosteroids may be considered, in addition to intrathecal methotrexate, in certain patients. Since the novel perforin mutation has been reported in only 2 patients from Oman, and since similar polymorphism in the sequencing data of the members of their families has been identified, a founder effect is possible in this population."

Swab specimens were taken from 162 active cases with ulcerative lesions and in 135 of these (83.3%) the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by the IS2404 polymerase chain reaction. Most lesions (93%) were located on the extremities, with lower limbs being twice as commonly involved as upper limbs. The age of patients with active BU ranged from 2 to 90 years with a median age of 14.5 years. Vaccination with bacilli Calmette-Guérin appeared to protect children against more severe forms of BU with multiple lesions. We conclude that in Cameroon BU is endemic, at least in the study area, and that a comprehensive control program for BU in Cameroon is urgently needed."

CMV infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. When CIB were present in the liver, CMV infection also tended to be systemic. All the adults were immunocompromised patients, but diseases inducing immunodeficiency were present in only two of the infants. The severe and systemic CMV infections we found in infants might have been associated with congenital CMV infection. Histologically, hepatocyte necrosis, cholestasis, extramedullary hematopoiesis and fatty degeneration were more frequent and prominent in infants than in adults. However, inflammatory cell infiltration was only slight. In addition, the frequent association with premature birth and hypoplasia of the thymus suggested that insufficient development of immunity may result in hepatic CMV involvement in infants. CIB were most frequently observed in hepatocytes in both infants and adults, but in infants they were also frequently seen in the bile duct epithelium. These histopathological findings and the high incidence of jaundice in infant patients suggest that the bile duct is also an important site of CMV proliferation in infants, and that CMV infection may be one cause of infantile jaundice."
CD011926,0,8295341,0,[Detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA in peripheral leukocytes by AMPLICOR HIV-1 test kit].,"AMPLICOR HIV-1 test kits, which had been developed as an HIV-1 provirus detection test by PCR method, have been evaluated for its clinical diagnostic application. Sixty-six of HIV-1 antibody positive and 67 of HIV-1 antibody negative blood samples derived from hemophiliacs, who had received blood products, have been tested by AMPLICOR HIV-1. All of the results from AMPLICOR HIV-1 were consistent with those from antibody test and clinical aspects. Thirty-nine of HIV-1 antibody positive samples have been tested by AMPLICOR HIV-1 and virus isolation (culture method). Twelve of 39 (30.8%) were positive by virus isolation, and 39 of 39 (100%) were positive by AMPLICOR HIV-1. Two of new born infants from HIV-1 sero-positive mothers were tested by AMPLICOR HIV-1, and the result suggested that the kit would be useful for diagnosis of infants from sero-positive mothers. Based on these studies, AMPLICOR HIV-1 is considered as useful clinical diagnostic for HIV-1 proviral DNA detection."

CD011926,0,19107978,0,Prevalence of HHV-6 integrated chromosomally among children treated for acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia in the Czech Republic.,"Chromosomal integration of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a novel situation found in a small percentage of individuals. While active HHV-6 infection is treatable using antivirals, the abnormally high level of HHV-6 DNA found in chromosomal integration of HHV-6 (CI-HHV-6) is not affected by such drugs. Stored DNA samples taken originally for detection of fusion genes and minimal residual disease from 339 pediatric patients treated for leukemia in the Czech Republic between the years 1995-2007 were tested retrospectively. Using real-time quantitative PCR technology, the quantity of HHV-6 DNA detected was normalized to 100,000 human genome equivalents as assessed by quantitation of the albumin gene. HHV-6 DNA was detected in 107 samples from 91 patients (26.8%). In the majority of samples (99) only a minute level of normalized viral copies (NVCs) (median 1.84 NVCs) was detected. A high viral load of approximately 100,000 NVCs was detected in 5 patients (1.5%; median 140,150 NVCs), in all of whom were confirmed subsequently CI-HHV-6 by a detection of HHV-6 DNA in hair follicles or in the nails. In all but one patient with HHV-6 variant B, variant A of the virus was detected. None of the patients with CI-HHV-6 had complications attributable to HHV-6 infection. The prevalence of CI-HHV-6 in childhood leukemia does not differ from that published for other patients or healthy populations. Where high levels of HHV-6 DNA are present, CI-HHV-6 should be confirmed as soon as possible so that potentially toxic but ineffective antiviral treatment can be stopped."
CD011926,0,17224087,0,Incidence of cryptosporidiosis species in paediatric patients in Malawi.,"We determined the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in children aged <5 years presenting with diarrhoea in an urban and rural hospital-based setting in Malawi. Stools were collected over a 22-month period during both rainy and dry seasons. A range of microscopic methods were used to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. Species determination was by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of oocyst-extracted DNA using 18S rRNA and COWP gene loci. Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were seen in 5.9% (50/848) of samples, of which 43 amplified by PCR-RFLP indicated the following species: C. hominis, C. parvum, C. hominis/C. parvum, C. meleagridis and C. andersoni. Seven samples could not be amplified by PCR. Wider species diversity was found in the rural setting, and may be a result of increased malnutrition and zoonotic exposure in this area. Improvements in water, sanitation, household hygiene and animal control are required to reduce the incidence of infection in this population."

It has a series of differential charts to assist in identification and a large chart with the reactions of 98 different organisms for 47 tests often used in identification. A simplified version of this chart gives the most common species and tests most often used for identification. The sources of the new organisms are listed, and their role in human disease is discussed. Fourteen new groups of Enterobacteriaceae are described for the first time. These new groups are biochemically distinct from previously described species, biogroups, and Enteric Groups of Enterobacteriaceae. The new groups are Citrobacter amalonaticus biogroup 1, Klebsiella group 47 (indole positive, ornithine positive), Serratia marcescens biogroup 1, and unclassified Enteric Groups 17, 45, 57, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 68, and 69."

CD011926,0,12536607,0,[Study on molecular epidemiology of HCMV infection in mothers and their newborns in Changsha].,"The detection of HCMV-IgG, IgM in plasma by ELISA and DNA in plasma and P(C) BMCs from mothers and their newborns by PCR was carried out. Positive HCMV-IgG, HCMV-IgM, P(C)BMCs HCMV DNA and plasma HCMV DNA were demonstrated in 119(95.2%), 7(5.6%), 27(21.6%) and 14(11.2%) in 125 mothers and 117(93.6%), 1(0.8%), 18(14.4%) and 7(5.6%) in their mewborns, respectively. There were significant differences among the positive rate of newborn's HCMV-IgM, plasma HCMV DNA and CBMCs HCMV DNA (P < 0.05), but the difference between HCMV-IgM and plasma HCMV DNA had no statistic significance (P > 0.05).

CD011926,0,10517191,0,Low prevalence of the immunoglobulin-A-binding beta antigen of the C protein among Streptococcus agalactiae isolates causing neonatal sepsis.,"Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS) is the most important pathogen causing neonatal sepsis. The role of bacterial proteins contributing to pathogenicity in GBS infections has not yet been clearly determined, but the C protein complex has been suggested to be involved in both virulence and protective immunity. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of GBS strains bearing the gene encoding for the beta antigen of the C protein among clinical isolates from 68 neonates with sepsis, 45 newborns colonized without clinical signs of infection, and 50 isolates from pregnant women. The prevalence of the beta antigen gene in all three groups was low (24% vs. 19% vs. 22%) [corrected], and the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Clinical characteristics and cytokine plasma levels did not differ between septic patients with beta antigen-positive and -negative strains. The beta-antigen gene was not found among serotype III isolates, which accounted for roughly half of all the strains isolated. Thus, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis based on the beta antigen gene seems not helpful for distinguishing invasive from colonizing GBS strains. A vaccine based on peptide antigens from the beta antigen of the C protein would most probably not provide protection against the majority of GBS isolates. When analyzing the PCR products of the C protein beta antigen gene by DNA sequencing, a genetic heterogeneity was observed, revealing small repetitive genetic elements within the amplified fragment, an observation that should be studied further."
CD011926,0,24554743,0,"Characterization of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains isolated from Nicaraguan children in hospital, primary care and community settings.","Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea among young children in developing countries. ETEC vaccines offer promise in reducing the burden of ETEC disease, but the development of these vaccines relies on the characterization of ETEC isolates from a variety of settings. To best reflect the full spectrum of ETEC disease in León, Nicaragua, the aim of this study was to characterize ETEC strains isolated from children with diarrhoea attending different settings (hospital, primary care clinics and in the community) and children from different age groups. We characterized ETEC isolates in terms of their colonization factors (CFs) and enterotoxins, and determined whether these factors varied with setting and age group. Diarrhoeal stool samples were obtained from children under the age of 60 months from: (1) the regional public hospital, (2) four public primary care clinics, and (3) a population-based cohort. In total, 58 ETEC-positive isolates were analysed by multiplex-PCR assays for the identification of CFs (CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4, CS5, CS6, CS7, CS8, CS12, CS13, CS14, CS15, CS17, CS18, CS19, CS20, CS21, CS22 and CFA/I), and enterotoxins [heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable variants STh and STp]. The frequency of CFs and enterotoxins was compared among the three settings and for different age groups, using Fisher's exact test or a χ(2) test. At least one CF was detected among one-half of samples; CS19 was detected among all strains in which a CF was identified, either alone or in combination with another CF. Among all CFs detected, 91.7 % were identified as members of the class 5 fimbrial family. CFs were detected more commonly among samples from infants captured in the health facility setting compared with the community setting. Overall, LT was detected among 67.2 % of samples, STh was detected among 20.7 % and both enterotoxins were detected among 12.1 %. The enterotoxin STh was detected more commonly among cases in the community, whilst a combination of STh and LT was detected more commonly among cases treated in health facilities. Our results suggest that, to protect against diarrhoeal cases associated with this E. coli pathotype in León, Nicaragua, an ETEC vaccine that effectively targets the archeotype CFA/I of the class 5 fimbrial family would be the most effective in this setting."
CD011926,0,19621608,0,[Influenza surveillance results in 2007-2008 winter season in nine provinces of Turkey].,"Influenza virus infections constitute a serious public health problem owing to their epidemic and pandemic potential. Turkish Ministry of Health established the national influenza surveillance programme in two institutes to detect the virus types leading to the illness and the efficiency of the seasonal vaccine. Influenza surveillance is performed by Refik Saydam Hygiene Center, National Influenza Laboratory in nine provinces (which are located at central, northeast, south and east parts of Turkey) and by Istanbul University, Medical Faculty, Virology Laboratory in five provinces (which are located at west and northwest parts of Turkey). These two centers are the members of international information networks. The surveillance was aimed to contribute to the detection of influenza viruses with pandemic potential and also to determine the predominant strain circulating in Turkey. During November 2007-May 2008 period a total of 1157 clinical specimens collected from 90 health centers which were the representatives of nine provinces (Ankara, Samsun, Trabzon, Erzurum, Adana, Konya, Diyarbakir, Malatya and Van) were investigated for the presence of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses (Parainfluenza virus types 1-3, Respiratory Synctial Virus and Adenovirus). Samples were identified and subtyped by both molecular (real-time PCR) and cell culture techniques (MDCK and Hep-2). Influenza virus and at least one of the other respiratory viruses were detected in 321 (27.7%) and two different viruses in 16 of the specimens (total= 337). When all the specimens were considered, the most frequently identified virus was influenza A (n=188, 16.2%), H1N1 being 6.3% and H3N2 9.9%.The rate of identification for influenza B was 7.6% (n=88), for parainfluenza was 2.3% (n=27), for adenovirus was 2% (n=24) and for RSV was 0.9% (n=10). When only the positive specimens (n=337) were evaluated, influenza A was again the most frequently (55.7%) encountered virus, H1N1 being 38.8% and H3N2 61.2% of all. Influenza B was in the second rank with 26.1% frequency among the positive specimens. The results showed that influenza activity started around November and ended around May. When the distribution of influenza viruses were analysed according to months, Influenza A H1N1 predominated in January, influenza A H3N2 in December and February. influenza B viruses started to increase in February, and were also detected in May. The 2007-2008 influenza season in Turkey was characterized by moderate clinical activity, and a predominance of influenza A H3N2. These results indicate good match between the vaccine virus strains and the reported virus strains."
CD011926,0,14981245,0,TLR2 is expressed on activated T cells as a costimulatory receptor.,"Toll is the founder of a group of pattern recognition receptors that play a critical role in the innate immunity in Drosophila. At least 10 distinct Toll-like receptors (TLRs), recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns, have now been identified in humans. Most investigations on TLRs have focused on cells of the innate system. We report here that naïve human T cells expressed high levels of cell-surface TLR2 after activation by anti-T cell receptor antibody and IFN-alpha. Activated cells produced elevated levels of cytokines in response to the TLR2 ligand, bacterial lipopeptide. Furthermore, CD4(+)CD45RO(+) memory T cells from peripheral blood constitutively expressed TLR2 and produced IFN-gamma in response to bacterial lipopeptide, which also markedly enhanced the proliferation and IFN-gamma production by CD45RO(+) T cells in the presence of IL-2 or IL-15. Thus, TLR2 serves as a costimulatory receptor for antigen-specific T cell development and participates in the maintenance of T cell memory. This suggests that pathogens, via their pathogen-associated molecular patterns, may contribute directly to the perpetuation and activation of long-term T cell memory in both antigen-dependent and independent manner."

CD011926,0,22448257,0,Evaluation of a rapid immunochromatographic ODK-0901 test for detection of pneumococcal antigen in middle ear fluids and nasopharyngeal secretions.,"Since the incidence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has been increasing at an astonishing rate throughout the world, the need for accurate and rapid identification of pneumococci has become increasingly important to determine the appropriate antimicrobial treatment. We have evaluated an immunochromatographic test (ODK-0901) that detects pneumococcal antigens using 264 middle ear fluids (MEFs) and 268 nasopharyngeal secretions (NPSs). A sample was defined to contain S. pneumoniae when optochin and bile sensitive alpha hemolytic streptococcal colonies were isolated by culture. The sensitivity and specificity of the ODK-0901 test were 81.4% and 80.5%, respectively, for MEFs from patients with acute otitis media (AOM). In addition, the sensitivity and specificity were 75.2% and 88.8%, respectively, for NPSs from patients with acute rhinosinusitis. The ODK-0901 test may provide a rapid and highly sensitive evaluation of the presence of S. pneumoniae and thus may be a promising method of identifying pneumococci in MEFs and NPSs."

Virologic investigations included culture from urine, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid, detection of CMV DNA by polymerase chain reaction, and detection of CMV class-specific antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) by enzyme immunoassays. Six infants were given ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks (group 1); the other six infants were given 7.5 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks and 10 mg/kg three times weekly for 3 months (group 2). In group 1 the CMV cultures of specimens from three infants became sterile; two of these infants also had negative results on CMV DNA studies; results of culture and CMV DNA study were still positive after ganciclovir therapy in the remaining three infants. Subsequently, normal outcome was observed in only two patients. In group 2, all infants had negative CMV-culture and CMV DNA results; clinical improvement was evident in five infants, one of whom had later development of mild psychomotor retardation. In another infant, severe psychomotor retardation and hearing loss developed after transient improvement developed. These preliminary data indicate that a ganciclovir regimen including a higher dose and more prolonged therapy might be more effective in infants with symptomatic congenital CMV infection."

The disease is particularly severe in infants who are less than 3 months old, who are not protected against the disease and are often contaminated by their parents. Atypical presentations are frequent and neonatal pertussis is rare. We report a case of malignant whooping cough in a newborn infant probably contaminated by her mother. Diagnosis was suspected clinically because of persistent coughing fits and was confirmed by serology. Treatment was successful. We discuss the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive issues of whooping cough in developing countries. In Africa, where complementary investigations such as PCR are seldom accessible, a careful clinical study and the analysis of the absolute rate of lymphocytes could be an alternative for the diagnosis of whooping cough. Vaccination of teenagers and adults is also problematic in poor countries. High-performance new vaccine candidates may contribute to a better control of whooping cough."

CD011926,0,15155185,0,"Nosocomial spread of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing a novel class a beta-lactamase, GES-3, in a neonatal intensive care unit in Japan.","Klebsiella pneumoniae strain KG525, which showed high-level resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, was isolated from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a Japanese hospital in March 2002. The ceftazidime resistance of strain KG525 was transferable to Escherichia coli CSH-2 by conjugation. Cloning and sequence analysis revealed that production of a novel extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamase (pI 7.0), designated GES-3, which had two amino acid substitutions of M62T and E104K on the basis of the sequence of GES-1, was responsible for resistance in strain KG525 and its transconjugant. The bla(GES-3) gene was located as the first gene cassette in a class 1 integron that also contained an aacA1-orfG fused gene cassette and one unique cassette that has not been described in other class 1 integrons and ended with a truncated 3' conserved segment by insertion of IS26. Another five ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae strains, strains KG914, KG1116, KG545, KG502, and KG827, which were isolated from different neonates during a 1-year period in the same NICU where strain KG525 had been isolated, were also positive for GES-type beta-lactamase genes by PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR analyses displayed genetic relatedness among the six K. pneumoniae strains. Southern hybridization analysis with a GES-type beta-lactamase gene-specific probe showed that the locations of bla(GES) were multiple and diverse among the six strains. These findings suggest that within the NICU setting genetically related K. pneumoniae strains carrying the bla(GES) gene were ambushed with genetic rearrangements that caused the multiplication and translocation of the bla(GES) gene."

CD011926,0,22022439,0,Staphylococcal Panton-Valentine leucocidin as a major virulence factor associated to furuncles.,"Panton-Valentine Leucocidin (PVL), one of the β-barrel pore-forming staphylococcal leucotoxins, is known to be associated to furuncles and some severe community pneumonia. However, it is still uncertain how many other virulence factors are also associated to furuncles and what the risk factors of furuncles are in immuno-compromised status of patients, especially the HIV (+) patients. In this paper, we use antigen immunoprecipitation and multiplex PCR approach to determine the presence of 19 toxins, 8 adhesion factors and the PFGE profiles associated to furuncles in three independent patient study groups of S. aureus (SA) isolates collected from the Cayenne General Hospital (French Guiana). The patient groups were made of: 16 isolates from HIV (-) patients, 9 from HIV (+) patients suffering from furuncles, and 30 control isolates from patients with diverse secondary infected dermatitis. Our data reveals that the majority (96%) of SA strains isolated from HIV patient-derived furuncles significantly produced PVL (p<10(-7)), whereas only 10% of SA strains produced this toxin in secondary infected dermatosis. A high prevalence of LukE-LukD-producing isolates (56 to 78%) was recorded in patient groups. Genes encoding clumping factor B, collagen- and laminin-binding proteins (clfB, cna, lbp, respectively) were markedly frequent (30 to 55%), without being associated to a specific group. Pulse field gel electrophoresis evidenced 24 overall pulsotypes, whereas the 25 PVL-producing isolates were distributed into 15 non clonal fingerprints. These pulsotypes were not specific PVL-producing isolates. PVL appears to be the major virulence factor associated to furuncles in Europe and in South America regardless of the immune status of the HIV patients."

A total of 202 whole-blood samples from adults whose HIV status was known were studied. This included 100 HIV-1-positive and 102 HIV-1-negative samples selected on the basis of concordant results obtained with two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The prototype Roche DNA PCR assay had a 100% sensitivity for the detection of HIV-1 DNA and a specificity of 100%. We conclude that the new Roche DNA PCR kit is accurate for the detection of HIV DNA in Zimbabwean samples, in which HIV-1 subtype C dominates."

CD011926,0,25471195,0,Molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of Clostridium difficile isolated from a university teaching hospital in Japan.,"Clostridium difficile infection control strategies require an understanding of its epidemiology. In this study, we analysed the toxin genotypes of 130 non-duplicate clinical isolates of C. difficile from a university hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and eBURST analysis were performed for these isolates and nine strains previously analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for six antibiotics, and the bacterial resistance mechanisms were investigated. Ninety-five toxigenic strains (73%), including seven tcdA-negative, tcdB-positive and cdtA/cdtB-negative strains (A(-)B(+)CDT(-)) and three A(+)B(+)CDT(+) strains, and 35 (27%) non-toxigenic strains, were classified into 23 and 12 sequence types, respectively. Of these, sequence type (ST)17 (21.8%) was the most predominant. MLST and eBURST analysis showed that 139 strains belonged to seven groups and singletons, and most A(+)B(+)CDT(-) strains (98%, 89/91) were classified into group 1. All isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, vancomycin and meropenem; the ceftriaxone, clindamycin and ciprofloxacin resistance rates were 49, 59 and 99%, respectively. Resistance rates to ceftriaxone and clindamycin were higher in toxigenic strains than in non-toxigenic strains (P < 0.001). All ST17 and ST81 strains were resistant to these antibiotics. The clindamycin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains carried erm(B) and mutations in GyrA and/or GyrB, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first MLST-based study of the molecular epidemiology of toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains in Japan, providing evidence that non-toxigenic and toxigenic strains exhibit high genetic diversity and that toxigenic strains are more likely than non-toxigenic strains to exhibit multidrug resistance."
CD011926,0,26163924,0,"Hepatitis B virus infection in HIV-exposed infants in the Western Cape, South Africa.","Hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is a significant public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Universal infant vaccination with the hepatitis B (HB) vaccine has been implemented within the South African Expanded Programme of Immunization since April 1995 with concomitant reduction in HBV infection in children. However, the first vaccine dose is only administered at six weeks of age. This delay may lead to a failure to reduce the risk of perinatal HBV transmission to infants born to HIV/HBV co-infected women, in whom HBV infection is often upregulated. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBV infection in babies born to HIV-infected mothers in the Western Cape, South Africa. HBV serological markers were tested in all infant serum samples and following HB viral load testing, sequencing and genotyping were also performed. Three of 1000 samples screened tested positive for HBsAg and HBV DNA. An additional infant tested positive for HBV DNA alone. All babies had received the HB vaccine at 6, 10 and 14 weeks. The prevalence of HBV infection was therefore 4/1000 (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.01-0.79%). Three of four infants and all four mothers were followed-up. Two infants were persistently positive for HBsAg with viral loads above 10(8) International Units per millilitre. All four maternal samples were positive for HBsAg and HBeAg and one was also positive for anti-HBe. Sequencing analysis of two mother-child HBV pairs showed 100% sequence identity. This study demonstrates HBV infection in HIV-exposed infants despite HB vaccination from 6 weeks of age. A more strategic approach is needed to prevent mother to child transmission of HBV, including screening of pregnant women, HBV-targeted antiviral therapy and HB birth dose vaccine."

Epidemiologic and obstetric data on the HTLV-1-positive pregnant women were analyzed and compared with data on a control group of HTLV-1-negative pregnant women. The mean age of the HTLV-1-positive women was 26.2 years. All were seronegative for HIV and syphilis, and only 2 reported a past history of sexually transmitted infection and more than 10 sexual partners. Of the HTLV-1-positive women, 88.5% were breast-fed, 4% were bottle fed, and 7.5% did not know. Six women had received blood transfusions, and only 1 reported intravenous drug use. Fifty-two HTLV-1-positive women could be followed: 45 had full-term deliveries, 5 had premature deliveries, and 2 had abortions. Our results indicate that (1) the frequency of HTLV-1 infection among pregnant women is relatively high in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil; (2) maternal infection was probably acquired more frequently through breast-feeding, but the sexual route was certainly the second most important means of transmission; (3) HTLV-1-positive women had a history of eczema-like infections in childhood more frequently than the control group; (4) HTLV-1 infection did not interfere in the course of pregnancy; and (5) no associated congenital infections were observed in the HTLV-1-positive women."
CD011926,0,21393454,0,Prevalence and diversity of Clostridium difficile strains in infants.,"During early infancy asymptomatic intestinal colonization by Clostridium difficile is frequent. To update information on infant colonization prevalence and to characterize infant strains, in terms of their virulence factors and their phylogenetic diversity, a prospective screening of C. difficile in the stools of infants 0 to 2 years old was conducted at Jean Verdier Hospital (Hôpital Jean Verdier) over an 18 month period. C. difficile was screened by toxigenic culture, and molecular characterization was performed by PCR-ribotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The overall C. difficile colonization prevalence was 33.7 % (99/294). The colonization rate by a toxigenic strain was 7.1 % (21/294). Community-acquired C. difficile accounted for 66.7 % (66/99) of cases. Molecular typing was performed on 90 isolates from Jean Verdier Hospital and 8 additional isolates from another hospital in Versailles (Centre Hospitalier de Versailles). Among these isolates, 23 were toxigenic (21 tcdA(+)/tcdB(+) and 2 tcdA(-)/tcdB(+)). All the isolates were negative for the binary toxin genes. Seventeen PCR ribotypes (PRs) were identified, with five PRs accounting for 82.7 % (81/98) of the isolates. MLST generated 15 different sequence types (STs). The predominant genotype, PRJV11-ST38 (33.7 %), included only non-toxigenic strains. Toxigenic strains were distributed in eight genotypes. Neither PR027-ST3, nor PR078/126-ST49 were identified but some PRs/STs corresponded to well-known adult infectious strains. These results indicate that infants are widely colonized by non-toxigenic strains. However, toxigenic adult infectious strains circulate in asymptomatic infants even in the community; thus, infants may be a reservoir for adult infectious strains."
CD011926,0,21393459,0,Real-time PCR-based detection of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis in an Irish paediatric population.,"Novel real-time PCR assays targeting the Bordetella pertussis insertion sequence IS481, the toxin promoter region and Bordetella parapertussis insertion sequence IS1001 were designed. PCR assays were capable of detecting ≤10 copies of target DNA per reaction, with an amplification efficiency of ≥90 %. From September 2003 to December 2009, per-nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates submitted for B. pertussis culture from patients ≤1 month to >15 years of age were examined by real-time PCR. Among 1324 patients, 76 (5.7 %) were B. pertussis culture positive and 145 (10.95 %) were B. pertussis PCR positive. Of the B. pertussis PCR-positive patients, 117 (81 %) were aged 6 months or less. A total of 1548 samples were examined, of which 87 (5.6 %) were culture positive for B. pertussis and 169 (10.92 %) were B. pertussis PCR positive. All culture-positive samples were PCR positive. Seven specimens (0.5 %) were B. parapertussis culture positive and 10 (0.8 %) were B. parapertussis PCR positive, with all culture-positive samples yielding PCR-positive results. A review of patient laboratory records showed that of the 1324 patients tested for pertussis 555 (42 %) had samples referred for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) testing and 165 (30 %) were positive, as compared to 19.4 % of the total 5719 patients tested for RSV in this period. Analysis of the age distribution of RSV-positive patients identified that 129 (78 %) were aged 6 months or less, similar to the incidence observed for pertussis in that patient age group. In conclusion, the introduction of the real-time PCR assays for the routine detection of B. pertussis resulted in a 91 % increase in the detection of the organism as compared to microbiological culture. The incidence of infection with B. parapertussis is low while the incidence of RSV infection in infants suspected of having pertussis is high, with a similar age distribution to B. pertussis infection."

CD011926,0,25908431,0,Spectrum of enteropathogens detected by the FilmArray GI Panel in a multicentre study of community-acquired gastroenteritis.,"The European, multicentre, quarterly point-prevalence study of community-acquired diarrhoea (EUCODI) analysed stool samples received at ten participating clinical microbiology laboratories (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, and the UK) in 2014. On four specified days, each local laboratory submitted samples from ≤20 consecutive patients to the Austrian Study Centre for further testing with the FilmArray GI Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). Of the 709 samples from as many patients received, 325 (45.8%) tested negative, 268 (37.8%) yielded only one organism, and 116 (16.4%) yielded multiple organisms. Positivity rates ranged from 41% (30 of 73 samples) in France to 74% (59 of 80 samples) in Romania. With the exception of Entamoeba histolytica and Vibrio cholerae, all of the 22 targeted pathogens were detected at least once. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter species, toxigenic Clostridium difficile, enteroaggregative E. coli, norovirus and enterotoxigenic E. coli were the six most commonly detected pathogens. When tested according to local protocols, seven of 128 positive samples (5.5%) yielded multiple organisms. Overall, the FilmArray GI Panel detected at least one organism in 54.2% (384/709) of the samples, as compared with 18.1% (128/709) when testing was performed with conventional techniques locally. This underlines the considerable potential of multiplex PCR to improve routine stool diagnostics in community-acquired diarrhoea. Classic culture methods directed at the isolation of specific pathogens are increasingly becoming second-line tools, being deployed when rapid molecular tests give positive results. This optimizes the yield from stool examinations and dramatically improves the timeliness of diagnosis."

CD011926,0,9539794,0,Latent varicella-zoster virus is located predominantly in neurons in human trigeminal ganglia.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpesvirus that causes varicella (chicken pox) as a primary infection and, after a variable period of latency in trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia, reactivates to cause herpes zoster (shingles). Both of these conditions may be followed by a variety of neurological complications, especially in immunocompromised individuals such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. There have been a number of conflicting reports regarding the cellular location of latent VZV within human ganglia. To address this controversy we examined fixed wax-embedded trigeminal ganglia from 30 individuals obtained at autopsy, including 11 with HIV infection, 2 neonates, and 17 immunocompetent individuals, for the presence of latent VZV. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridization, and PCR in situ amplification techniques with oligonucleotide probes and primer sequences to VZV genes 18, 21, 29, and 63 were used. VZV DNA in ganglia was detected in 15 individuals by using PCR alone, and in 12 individuals (6 normal non-HIV and 6 positive HIV individuals, but not neonatal ganglia) by using PCR in situ amplification. When in situ hybridization alone was used, 5 HIV-positive individuals and only 1 non-HIV individual showed VZV nucleic acid signals in ganglia. In all of the VZV-positive ganglia examined, VZV nucleic acid was detected in neuronal nuclei. Only occasional nonneuronal cells contained VZV DNA. We conclude from these studies that the neuron is the predominant site of latent VZV in human trigeminal ganglia."

We aim to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics of neonates and children with EV meningitis with a view to determine whether it could be discriminatory or otherwise in making a positive diagnosis. We performed a 3-year (July 2008-July 2011) retrospective study of children ≤16 years, treated at a tertiary children's hospital, with positive CSF EV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and negative blood and CSF bacterial cultures. A total of 206 children were studied. The median CSF white cell count was 79 cells/mm(3) (range 0-4608 cells/mm(3)). CSF pleocytosis was observed in 99/150 (66%) aged ≤90 days, 3/4 (75%) aged 90 days-1 year, and 49/52 (94%) children ≥3 years. There was a huge variability in CSF pleocytosis in infants ≤90 days, where 34% of them had no pleocytosis, while in 66%, a wide range of pleocytosis that might even suggest bacterial meningitis was noted. CSF red cells were low, and protein or sugar values were not discriminatory. CSF pleocytosis in relation to increasing age was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Early lumbar puncture within 48 h of symptoms and absence of CSF pleocytosis was also statistically significant (p = 0.039). CSF pleocytosis in EV meningitis is commoner in older children. As there was a huge variability in CSF pleocytosis in infants ≤90 days particularly, CSF analysis including EV PCR could avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy."

The genome sequence analysis showed that the strains implicated in the outbreak formed three phylogenetically distinct clusters. One cluster represented cases associated with recent exposure to a single strain, whereas the other two clusters represented related but distinct strains of S. sonnei circulating in the OJ community across the UK. The WGS data challenged the conclusions drawn during the initial outbreak investigation and allowed cases of dysentery to be implicated or ruled out of the outbreak that were previously misclassified. This study showed that the resolution achieved using WGS would have clearly defined the outbreak, thus facilitating the promotion of infection control measures within local schools and the dissemination of a stronger public health message to the community."

Emerging evidence suggests stillbirths are often multifactorial. The absence of a known cause leads to uncertainty regarding the risk of recurrence, which can cause extreme anguish for parents that may manifest as guilt, anger or bewilderment. Further, clinical endeavours to prevent recurrences in future pregnancies are impaired by lack of a defined aetiology. Therefore, efforts to provide an aetiological diagnosis of stillbirth impact upon all aspects of care of the mother, and inform many parts of clinical decision making. Despite the magnitude of the problem, that is 7 stillbirths per 1000 births in Australia, diagnostic efforts to discover viral aetiologies are often minimal. Viruses and other difficult to culture organisms have been postulated as the aetiology of a number of obstetric and paediatric conditions of unknown cause, including stillbirth. Reasons forwarded for testing stillbirth cases for infectious agents are non-medical factors, including addressing all parents' need for diagnostic closure, identifying infectious agents as a sporadic cause of stillbirth to reassure parents and clinicians regarding risk for future pregnancies, and to reduce unnecessary testing. It is clear that viral agents including rubella, human cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus B19, herpes simplex virus (HSV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) may cause intrauterine deaths. Evidence for many other agents is that minimal or asymptomatic infections also occur, so improved markers of adverse outcomes are needed. The role of other viruses and difficult-to-culture organisms in stillbirth is uncertain, and needs more research. However, testing stillborn babies for some viral agents remains a useful adjunct to histopathological and other examinations at autopsy. Modern molecular techniques such as multiplex PCR, allow searches for multiple agents. Now that such testing is available, it is important to assess the clinical usefulness of such testing."

HCV RNA was detected in 17/20 blood samples (85%), 7/14 vaginal discharge samples (50%) and 4/10 cord blood samples (40%). However, no HCV RNA was identified in the peripheral blood of infants or breast milk. The mother-to-child transmission of HCV at delivery or via breast milk does not appear to contribute much to maintaining the global HCV reservoir."

CD011926,0,11466275,0,"matB, a common fimbrillin gene of Escherichia coli, expressed in a genetically conserved, virulent clonal group.","A novel fimbrial type in Escherichia coli was identified and characterized. The expression of the fimbria was associated with the O18acK1H7 clonal group of E. coli, which cause newborn meningitis and septicemia when grown at low temperature; hence, it was named the Mat (meningitis associated and temperature regulated) fimbria. The fimbriae were purified from a fimA::cat sfaA::Gm fliC::St derivative of the O18K1H7 isolate E. coli IHE 3034. The purified Mat fimbrillin had an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa and did not serologically cross-react with the type 1 or S fimbria of the same strain. The matB gene encoding the major fimbrillin was cloned from the genomic DNA of the fimA::cat sfaA::Gm fliC::St derivative of IHE 3034. The predicted MatB sequence was of 195 amino acids, contained a signal sequence of 22 residues, and did not show significant homology to any of the previously characterized fimbrial proteins. The DNA sequence of matB was 97.8% identical to a region from nucleotides 17882 to 18469 in the 6- to 8-min region of the E. coli K-12 chromosome, reported to encode a hypothetical protein. The 7-kb DNA fragment containing matB of IHE 3034 was found by restriction mapping and partial DNA sequencing to be highly similar to the corresponding region in the K-12 chromosome. Trans complementation of the matB::cat mutation in the IHE 3034 chromosome showed that matB in combination with matA or matC restored surface expression of the Mat fimbria. A total of 27 isolates representing K-12 strains and the major pathogroups of E. coli were analyzed for the presence of a matB homolog as well as for expression of the Mat fimbria. A conserved matB homolog was found in 25 isolates; however, expression of the Mat fimbriae was detected only in the O18acK1H7 isolates. Expression of the Mat fimbria was temperature regulated, with no or a very small amount of fimbriae or intracellular MatB fimbrillin being detected in cells cultivated at 37(o)C. Reverse transcriptase PCR and complementation assays with mat genes controlled by the inducible trc promoter indicated that regulation of Mat fimbria expression involved both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events."

Blood strains from 108 patients were identified by PCR-based method. Some 30.5 % of candidemia were caused by Candida tropicalis, 28.7 % were due to Candida albicans, 24.1 % with Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto, 8.3 % with Candida glabrata sensu lato, 1.8 % involved Candida krusei and 6.6 % with other species. Candidemia was more common in intensive care unit settings (66 %). In vitro susceptibility to antifungal drugs was determined by a microdilution method; and new species-specific clinical breakpoints for fluconazole and voriconazole were applied. Overall susceptibility rates were 100 % for itraconazole, 91 % for fluconazole, 98 % for voriconazole and 99 % for amphotericin B. Fluconazole resistance was mostly among C. parapsilosis sensu stricto isolates (26.9 %). Most of the findings reported here agreed with epidemiological features common to other tertiary hospitals in Brazil; but also revealed some peculiarities, such as a high frequency of C. tropicalis associated with candidemia.

The laboratories analysed and reported cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) to the National Influenza Reference Laboratory, which performed more detailed antigenic and genetic characterisation of the virus isolates. In 2009/10, a total of 62,089 ILI cases, distributed in two peaks, were analysed, 25,985 of which were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Children aged 5–14 years were the most affected. Viruses were both antigenically and genetically similar to the pandemic strain A/California/7/2009, included in the 2009/10 pandemic vaccine. During the post-pandemic season, 1,496 ILI cases were tested for influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, 572 of which were positive. Infection was mainly diagnosed in adolescent and adults. Although the 2010/11 viruses remained antigenically similar to A/California/7/2009, increased genetic variation was observed.

CD011926,0,9139832,0,Association of the Epstein-Barr virus with Hodgkin's disease in Southern Israel.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been frequently documented in the putative neoplastic Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, in lymph nodes from patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD). This association varies in different geographic areas and between industrialized and developing countries, as does the epidemiological pattern of the disease. In the present study of 106 cases of HD from the Soroka Medical Center in Beer-Sheva, which serves as the only hospital for most of the southern part of Israel, we found an association with EBV expression in only 30% of the patients; 45% of mixed cellularity (MC) cases compared with 21% of nodular sclerosis (NS) cases were positive for EBV. The number of patients in the 0-14-year-old age group was limited; however, 8 of these II children were EBV positive. This low association rate of HD with the presence of EBV sequences is probably related to the small number of children in our series. A low proportion of EBV-associated disease in older adults may be contributory. Other factors may be involved."

There was a significant increase in the frequency of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates, from < 0.36% before 1999 to 4.8% in 2003, while the frequency of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates decreased during the same period. The most common ESBLs detected in K. pneumoniae were SHV type, whereas both CTX-M and SHV types were detected in E. coli. In addition, E. coli isolates showed greater clonal diversity (84 distinct REP-PCR patterns, compared with five in K. pneumoniae), fewer enzymes per isolate, and a higher number of isolates recovered from outpatients. These differences may have implications for the control measures that should be used for these two microorganisms."

An increase in the frequency of ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter has been reported globally due to a single base mutation (C-257 to T) in codon 86 of the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene altering the amino acid sequence from threonine at position 86 to isoleucine (Thr-86 to Ile).
CD011926,0,10732678,0,Functional analysis of the minor subunits of S fimbrial adhesion (SfaI) in pathogenic Escherichia coli.,"S fimbrial adhesins I and II (SfaI and II), produced by extraintestinal Escherichia coli pathogens that cause urinary tract infections (UTI) and newborn meningitis (NBM), respectively, mediate bacterial adherence to sialic acid-containing glycoprotein receptors present on host epithelial cells and extracellular matrix. The S fimbrial adhesin complexes consist of four proteins: SfaI-A, the major subunit protein and the minor subunit proteins SfaI-G, SfaI-S and SfaI-H. Sialic acid-specific binding is mediated by the minor subunit protein SfaI-S. In order to determine whether the minor subunit proteins SfaI-G, -S and -H play a role in the modulation of adherence and the degree of fimbriation, a trans-complementation system was developed. A non-adhesive E. coli K-12 derivative, harbouring the sfaI-A gene but lacking sfaI-G, -S and -H, was transformed with sfaI-G, -S or -H. Only SfaI-S was able to increase the degree of fimbriation and to confer adhesion properties on the recombinant E. coli K-12 strains. Amino acid residues in SfaI-S that are involved in modulation of fimbriation as well as in receptor recognition were localized by random and site-directed mutagenesis."

The mean annual incidence per 10(6) population was 6.6 in Australia and 2.2 in New Zealand. Of 312 episodes, CNVN caused 265 (85%; 98% of the episodes in immunocompromised hosts) and CNVG caused 47 (15%; 44% of the episodes in immunocompetent hosts). The incidence of AIDS-associated cases in Australia declined annually (P<.001). Aborigines in rural or semirural locations (P<.001) and immunocompetent males (P<.001) were at increased risk of CNVG infection. Cryptococcomas in lung or brain were more common in immunocompetent hosts (P< or =.03) in whom there was an association only between lung cryptococcomas and CNVG. An AIDS-associated genetic profile of CNVN serotype A was confirmed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA analysis. Resistance to antifungal drugs was uncommon. The epidemiology of CNVN infection has changed substantially. Clinical manifestations of disease are influenced more strongly by host immune status than by cryptococcal variety."

Reinfections occur throughout the life, but the severity of disease decreased with subsequent infection. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of RSV infections in two selected subpopulations: young children (below 5 y.) and adults with chronic respiratory diseases (25-87 y.). Nasopharyngeal swabs (334) collected from October 2008 to March 2010 were examined. The presence of RSV genome was determined by RT-PCR and the presence of RSV antigen by quick immunochromatographic test. Positive results of RT-PCR were found in 45.2% of all swabs: 48.6% samples in 2008; 41.5% in 2009; 50.8% in 2010. The highest frequency of RSV-positive samples was in fall-winter months, but differences in RSV epidemic seasons were found. In the first season (2008-2009) an increased number of RSV infections was observed from November 2008, but in the second season--from January 2010. Generally, the frequency of RSV-positive RT-PCR among children was 53%, among adults 25%. The highest difference was observed in the first three-month period of 2010. RT-PCR positive samples were found in 68.5% of children and 5.9% of adults. However, the RSV antigen was found in 44.4% of samples collected from adults in this period.

Initially, conventional bacteriological methods were used to identify colonies of E. coli which were then tested for VT production. Subsequently, specific DNA probes for VT1 and VT2 were used in hybridisation tests to detect VT-producing E. coli (VTEC). VTEC strains were isolated from 19 cases and in 15 they belonged to serogroup O157. Fourteen of these O157 strains possessed the flagellar antigen H7 and one was non-motile. The VTEC strains from the remaining four cases belonged to serotypes O26:H11, O104:H2, O153:H25, and O163:H19 together with a rough VT+ strain with flagellar antigen H51. The O157 strains hybridised with either the VT2 probe or both VT1 and VT2 probes. The other VTEC strains hybridised with either the VT1 or VT2 probe.

We studied the incidence and clinicopathologic features of NHL in 3,041 hemophiliacs followed at 18 US Hemophilia Centers between 1978 and 1989. Of the 1,295 (56.6%) who were HIV(+), 253 (19.5%) developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), of whom 14 (5.5%) developed NHL. Three NHL occurred in HIV(-) hemophiliacs, for a 36.5-fold greater risk in HIV(+) than HIV(-) hemophiliacs (P < .001). The NHL incidence rate was 29-fold greater than in the US population by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) estimates (P < .001). Between 0 and 4 lymphomas have been observed per year between 1978 and 1989. At presentation 13 (92.9%) of the HIV(+) NHL were extranodal. Ten were stage IV, 1 stage II, and 3 stage IE. Ten (71.4%) were high-grade, 3 (21.4%) intermediate-grade, and 1 (7.1%) was a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was detected in 36% by in situ hybridization, including one central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. The mean CD4 cell count at NHL diagnosis was 64/mm3, the mean latency from initial HIV infection was estimated to be 59 months, and the median survival was 7 months. The incidence of basal cell carcinoma in HIV(+) hemophiliacs was 18.3-fold greater than in HIV(-) hemophiliacs (P < .001) and 11.4-fold greater than in the US population (P < .001). In conclusion, incidence rates of NHL and basal cell carcinoma in HIV(+) hemophiliacs are significantly increased over rates in HIV(-) hemophiliacs and over rates in the US population. Clinicopathologic presentation of NHL in HIV(+) hemophiliacs is similar to that in HIV(+) homosexual men."

In order to understand the origin of NT Hi strains and their relationship with serotypeable strains, we analysed 125 NT Hi isolates collected from individual patients with either invasive disease (70 isolates) or respiratory tract infections (55 isolates). Serotype-specific and capsular transport genes were absent by PCR analysis, confirming their nonencapsulated status, which also suggested the NT Hi isolates were not encapsulated strains that shed their capsules. Multilocus sequence typing confirmed the NT Hi isolates did not have the same genetic background as serotypeable strains, including Hib. Despite the genetic heterogeneity found, two major genetic clusters were identified, both containing invasive and respiratory isolates. Fourteen invasive isolates and nine respiratory isolates produced beta-lactamase and were ampicillin resistant. More invasive (26.8%) than respiratory isolates (10.9%) showed decreased susceptibility towards ampicillin by a mechanism unrelated to beta-lactamase production. Besides a change in the capsule status of invasive Hi strains, the burden of invasive Hi disease, which used to be mainly a childhood disease, has now shifted to involve both adults and infants."

A total of 289 children who received chemotherapy and were tested for CMV infection were included in the study. CMV antigenemia and DNAemia were determined by identifying the pp65 antigen in leukocytes and performing real-time PCR. CMV disease was diagnosed by tissue biopsy, culture, or ophthalmic examination. Of the 289 children, CMV infection was demonstrated in 46 patients (15.9%). Young age at cancer diagnosis was the risk factor for CMV infection by multivariate analysis (7 mo vs. 7 y, P<0.001). Among 46 children with CMV infection, 10 (21.7%) were diagnosed with CMV disease; hepatitis (n=4), retinitis (n=3), hepatitis and pneumonia (n=2), and hepatitis and retinitis (n=1). The age of the patients with CMV disease was significantly younger than those without (3 vs. 16 mo, P=0.023). Retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma were the 2 most common underlying malignancies. There were 2 fatal cases associated with CMV disease, including 1 who died of CMV pneumonia. The findings of this study demonstrated significant morbidity of CMV infection and disease in young children during the course of chemotherapy without HSCT."

In particular, lower RTIs are a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality. Timely detection of the infecting respiratory pathogens is crucial to optimize treatment and care. In this study, three U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved molecular multiplex platforms (Prodesse ProFLU+/FAST+, FilmArray RP, and Verigene RV+) were evaluated for influenza virus detection in 171 clinical samples collected during the Belgian 2011-2012 influenza season. Sampling was done using mid-turbinate flocked swabs, and the collected samples were stored in universal transport medium. The amount of viral RNA present in the swab samples ranged between 3.07 and 8.82 log10 copies/ml. Sixty samples were concordant influenza A virus positive, and 8 samples were found to be concordant influenza B virus positive. Other respiratory viruses that were detected included human rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, human metapneumovirus, and coronavirus NL63. Twenty-five samples yielded discordant results across the various assays which required further characterization by sequencing. The FilmArray RP and Prodesse ProFLU+/FAST+ assays were convenient to perform with regard to sensitivity, ease of use, and low percentages of invalid results. Although the limit of sensitivity is of utmost importance, many other factors should be taken into account in selecting the most convenient molecular diagnostic assay for the detection of respiratory pathogens in clinical samples."
CD011926,0,11737672,0,"Bronchial Chlamydia pneumoniae infection, markers of allergic inflammation and lung function in children.","A relationship between respiratory Chlamydia pneumoniae infection (RCPI) and bronchial asthma is under discussion. Our objective was to study the frequency of RCPI and whether it is associated with markers of asthma in children with recurrent or chronic bronchitis as well as pneumonia. One-hundred and forty-eight children who underwent bronchoscopy were enrolled; 42 children with additional respiratory infections were excluded. Therefore, 106 children were examined, regarding a RCPI, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of tracheobronchial aspirate, eosinophilic inflammation of respiratory mucosa (cytology, eosinophilic cationic protein [ECP]), total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE for six important allergens, as well as lung function tests if possible. There was a RCPI in 55 of 106 children (51.9%); 25.4% of PCR positives (14/55) were weakly positive (double cut-off), which was more prevalent in the 2-5-year age-group and teenagers. Children with RCPI, inclusive of weak positives, showed a milder eosinophilia of nasal mucosa than children without RCPI (5.58% vs. 9.35%, p=0.039). Eosinophilia of > or =13% in nasal- and/or bronchial swab, as a marker for respiratory allergy, was less frequent in patients with RCPI too (7.3% vs. 21.6%, p=0.035). There were no differences in ECP. Total IgE was lower in PCR-positive children (101 vs. 179 IU/ml, p=0.032). Specific IgE with a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) of at least class 3 (as a marker for a relevant allergy), as well as any RAST above zero (to characterize early forms of allergy), were both less frequent in the RCPI group. In contrast, weak positives showed the highest rates of sensitization, surpassing RCPI negatives. In lung-function tests, vital capacity was lower in RCPI patients (87.5% vs. 95.3%, p=0.045); all parameters characterizing obstructive disturbance tended to be higher. Weak positives had both the greatest reduction of vital capacity (75.3%) and the most impaired obstructive parameters. All differences were accentuated in children of 11-18 years of age. Hence, our results indicate that in the children selected, a RCPI is common and not associated with allergic respiratory inflammation. Weak positives, however, differ, having the highest rate of allergic sensitization, reduction of lung volume, and obstructive disturbance. This group might be important in clinically observed asthma after pneumonia caused by C. pneumoniae. In these children, early diagnosis and treatment of a RCPI is recommended."
CD011926,0,12444458,0,"PCR typing of Plasmodium falciparum in matched peripheral, placental and umbilical cord blood.","A study was carried out in Lambaréné, Gabon, to analyse malarial infections in pregnant women. Blood samples from peripheral circulation and term placentas from 37 women were diagnosed as parasite-positive by thick blood smears. Infection was confirmed by PCR, using single-copy merozoite surface protein 1 and 2 genes. Of the 37 matched cord blood samples, 17 were positive by PCR amplification, even though all but one were microscopically negative. Five of these 17 samples were verified as positive in an antigen detection assay for histidine-rich protein 2. A comparison of alleles from these compartments indicates that single clonal infections were predominant for the cord samples, while double and triple infections were more common for peripheral and placental samples. Knowledge of the occurrence of parasites in each blood sample type is important towards understanding population dynamics in pregnant women and the development of immunity in infants to selected genotypes."
CD011926,0,12116026,0,Quantitation of viral load in neonatal herpes simplex virus infection and comparison between type 1 and type 2.,"Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a severe disease with high mortality and morbidity in spite of the development of effective anti-viral therapies. The viral load in neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection was measured retrospectively in 37 patients. HSV DNA copy numbers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were quantified using a real-time PCR assay. Patients with disseminated infection had a higher viral load in their sera. whereas patients with central nervous system (CNS) infection exhibited a higher viral load in the CSF. The viral load was significantly higher in the serum of patients who died later. Interestingly, patients with HSV type-2 infection exhibited more CNS involvement and neurological impairment, together with a high viral load in the CSF, than did HSV type-1 patients. These results suggest that quantitation of HSV viral load may be useful for assessing the prognosis, and may provide additional information for the management of neonatal HSV infection."

In this study we determine the prevalence, serotype distribution and genomic diversity of GBS in vagina of pregnant women. Vaginal swabs of 531 pregnant women were cultured on Columbia Agar Base Blood, GBS Agar Base and Todd Hewitt Broth. GBS were characterized by group and type-specific agglutination. Genomic polymorphism was studied by random amplification of DNA (RAPD). Seventeen patients (3.2%) were positive for GBS, resulting serotype III the most frequent. RAPD detected 16 different RAPD profiles from 21 GBS studied, revealing a good discriminatory power. In this sense, this method showed different genotype from GBS serotype III recovered from successive samples of two patients, suggesting reinfection. In conclusion, the combination of RAPD and serotyping appear promising for epidemiological studies. Finally, findings of reinfection after therapy during pregnancy, led us to suggest performing prenatal GBS screening and intrapartum prophylaxis in order to reduce neonatal risk."
CD011926,0,9257655,0,Elevated CD8+DR+ lymphocytes in HIV-exposed infants with early positive HIV cultures: a possible early marker of intrauterine transmission. Women and Infants Transmission Study Group.,"The associations among timing of maternal-fetal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, infant age at first positive HIV culture, and CD8+ lymphocyte activation were examined for 74 perinatally infected infants. Nineteen of the infected infants had positive HIV cultures at < or =7 days of life, and 55 had negative HIV cultures at < or =7 days but were positive later. Of the infants with early positive HIV-1 cultures, 15 of the 17 tested with DNA polymerase chain reaction methods had concordant results. The percentage of CD8+ and HLA-DR+ lymphocytes (CD8+DR+%) during the first week of life was significantly higher in infants with early compared with late positive cultures (median CD8+DR+% of 5.0% versus 2.0%, p = 0.0006). The CD8+DR+% was similar between uninfected infants and infants with late positive cultures during the first week of life (median 2%) but increased in infants with late positive cultures to 6% by 1 month. The CD4+% during the first 6 months of life was not different between infants with early or with late positive cultures, but infants with the highest CD8+DR+% at < or =7 days of life had significantly lower CD4+% at < or =7 days and at 1, 2, and 4 months of age. These data show that early CD8+ lymphocyte activation is associated with early positive HIV cultures and lower CD4+ percentages during early infancy and are consistent with the hypothesis that early positive cultures positivity may indicate in utero HIV infection."
CD011926,0,9257654,0,Immune complex-dissociated p24 antigen in congenital or perinatal HIV infection: role in the diagnosis and assessment of risk of infection in infants.,"Immune complex-dissociated (ICD) HIV-1 p24 antigen assay is a rapid technique for assessing the presence of HIV gag or core protein in plasma or serum. In this study, ICD p24 antigen detection in HIV-1 infected mothers and their infants enrolled in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS) was evaluated primarily as a diagnostic assay for HIV-1 detection in young infants and for its association with perinatal transmission. Plasma from 47 infected infants and 160 uninfected infants was examined, along with plasma from 197 of their mothers who had a delivery or close-to-delivery specimen. ICD p24 antigen was detected in plasma of 27.3% of infected infants at birth and in 70% to 81% at 1 to 6 months. The diagnostic specificity at birth was 90% and 98% to 100.0% at 1 to 6 months. The ICD p24 antigen concentration correlated with concurrent quantitative HIV culture results. The risk of transmission from mother to infant was higher if the mother had detectable ICD p24 antigen at or near the time of delivery (p = 0.002), but its presence did not accurately predict transmission (positive predictive value of 36%, negative predictive values of 85%). The relative ease of performing the ICD p24 antigen assay and the low cost compared with that of HIV culture or DNA PCR makes this test a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of perinatal HIV infection and for enhancing understanding of its pathogenesis, particularly where cost and availability limit access to more sensitive assays."
CD011926,0,8564370,0,Colonization factors of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) from residents of northern Egypt.,"Infection caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) poses a serious health problem to children in developing countries. Colonization of the small intestinal mucosa by ETEC strains is mediated by antigenically specific fimbriae, also known as colonization factor antigens (CFA). The importance of this study arises from reports that active and passive immunization with ETEC strains harboring CFAs induced protective immunity against diarrhea in animal models with preformed antibodies. In humans, ETEC containing CFA/I, II, III and IV have been identified. The aim of this study was to define CFAs of ETEC isolated in Alexandria, Egypt. One hundred and seven ETEC isolates from 132 human residents in Alexandria, Egypt were isolated during a birth cohort study. ETEC isolates were screened for heat labile (LT) and heat stable (ST) toxins using a 32P oligonucleotide hybridization probe and a GM1 ELISA. These isolates were examined using monoclonal antibodies against CFA/I, II, III, IV, and against the putative colonization antigens PCF0159 and PCF0166, CS 7 and CS 17. CFAs were found in 48% of ETEC strains. CFA/I was found in 18% of the strains, CFA/II in 10% and CFA/IV in 14%. CFA III was not found. All fifteen strains expressing CFA/IV expressed CS6 and produced ST. CFA/IV was not found in non-ST producing strains, while CFA/I was absent in ST-only producing strains."
CD011926,0,20463102,0,Dendritic cells in uninfected infants born to hepatitis B virus-positive mothers.,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play a central role in antiviral immunity, detecting viruses via Toll-like receptors (TLR) and producing in response vast amounts of type I interferons (IFNs). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes chronic infection after vertical transmission. This study investigated whether an HBV-infected maternal environment might influence DC numbers and pDC function in uninfected infants. Blood was collected from inactive HBsAg carrier and control mothers and their infants at birth and 1 and 6 months of age. HBV DNA was measured in maternal and neonatal perinatal sera using real-time PCR. The circulating frequencies of myeloid DCs (mDCs) and pDCs were determined in the babies by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cord blood pDCs were stimulated with resiquimod, and alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) production and the pDC phenotype were assessed. The effect of the common-cold virus, rhinovirus (RV), on resiquimod stimulation was also determined. HBV DNA was detected in 62.3% of the mothers and 41% of their infants. DC numbers and pDC functions were similar between subjects and controls and were not correlated with maternal or neonatal viremia. RV infection did not induce pDC maturation until the age of 6 months, and it reduced TLR7-dependent resiquimod-induced IFN-alpha production similarly in both groups. Although the DC system is immature at birth, DCs of uninfected neonates of HBV-positive mothers are competent to initiate and maintain T-cell responses. RV is a weak inducer of IFN-alpha production until the age of 6 months and inhibits IFN-alpha responses triggered by the TLR7 pathway."
CD011926,0,25038256,0,"Altered expression of autoimmune regulator in infant down syndrome thymus, a possible contributor to an autoimmune phenotype.","Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is associated with immunological dysfunctions such as increased frequency of infections and autoimmune diseases. Patients with DS share clinical features, such as autoimmune manifestations and specific autoantibodies, with patients affected by autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, located on chromosome 21, which regulates the expression of tissue-restricted Ags (TRAs) in thymic epithelial cells. We investigated the expression of AIRE and TRAs in DS and control thymic tissue using quantitative PCR. AIRE mRNA levels were elevated in thymic tissue from DS patients, and trends toward increased expression of the AIRE-controlled genes INSULIN and CHRNA1 were found. Immunohistochemical stainings showed altered cell composition and architecture of the thymic medulla in DS individuals with increased frequencies of AIRE-positive medullary epithelial cells and CD11c-positive dendritic cells as well as enlarged Hassall's corpuscles. In addition, we evaluated the proteomic profile of thymic exosomes in DS individuals and controls. DS exosomes carried a broader protein pool and also a larger pool of unique TRAs compared with control exosomes. In conclusion, the increased AIRE gene dose in DS could contribute to an autoimmune phenotype through multiple AIRE-mediated effects on homeostasis and function of thymic epithelial cells that affect thymic selection processes."

No specific analysis has been done on the epidemiological and clinical features of HAdV in pediatric pneumonia in China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children with pneumonia from June 2009 to May 2014. All samples that tested positive for HAdV were typed by sequencing the hexon and fiber genes. From a total of 3089 samples, 208 (6.7 %) were positive for HAdV, identified as belonging to HAdV-B (186, 89.4 %), HAdV-C (9, 4.3 %) and HAdV-E (1, 0.5 %). HAdV-7 (104, 50.0 %) and HAdV-3 (78, 37.5 %) were the two major types, followed by HAdV-1, HAdV-55 and HAdV-14. There were 87 (41.8 %) single HAdV infections, of which 80 % were HAdV-7 infections. Multivariate analysis showed that single infections with HAdV-7 were associated with a higher prevalence of severe pneumonia. Temporal patterns showed that, except for a simultaneous outbreak of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 during the years 2010-2011, HAdV-7 and HAdV-3 were alternately predominant, and the dominance shifted to HAdV-3 after 2014.

CSF were assayed by PCR for enterovirus (EV), herpesvirus (herpes simplex [HSV], varicella-zoster [VZV], cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr [EBV], and human herpes virus-6 [HHV-6]), mumps (MV), Toscana virus (TOSV), adenovirus (HAdV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), West Nile virus (WNV), and rabies. Serology was undertaken when methodology was available. Amongst meningitis cases, 57.1% were characterized; EV was the most frequent (76.8%), followed by VZV (10.3%) and HSV (3.1%; HSV-1: 1.6%; HSV-2: 1.0%, HSV non-typed: 0.5%). Cases due to CMV, EBV, HHV-6, MV, TOSV, HAdV, and LCMV were also detected. For meningoencephalitis, 40.7% of cases were diagnosed, HSV-1 (43.2%) and VZV (27.0%) being the most frequent agents, while cases associated with HSV-2, EV, CMV, MV, and LCMV were also detected. For encephalitis, 27.6% of cases were caused by HSV-1 (71.4%), VZV (19.1%), or EV (9.5%). Other positive neurological syndromes included cerebellitis (EV and HAdV), seizures (HSV), demyelinating disease (HSV-1 and HHV-6), myelopathy (VZV), and polyradiculoneuritis (HSV). No rabies or WNV cases were identified. EVs are the most frequent cause of meningitis, as is HSV for meningoencephalitis and encephalitis.

CD011926,0,12119775,0,[The effects of Cytomegalic virus (CMV) infection during pregnancy on the developing human fetus].,"In most instances Cytomegalic virus causes a sub-clinical infection, rendering the pregnant mother unaware of being infected. However, primary CMV is the most common infection during pregnancy that may have long-term neuro-developmental sequelae in 10%-20% of children born to these mothers. The clinical findings in these children include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), microcephaly, hearing and visual impairment, developmental delay, mental retardation and various neurological deficits. Serological diagnosis of primary CMV in the mother is difficult because IgM antibodies persist for long periods of time and both IgG and IgM antibodies may rise during secondary infection that is generally less dangerous to the human embryo in comparison to primary infection. A more reliable diagnostic procedure is to assess fetal infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and CMV culture performed in amniotic fluid at least 6 weeks following presumed maternal infection and past the 21st week of pregnancy. Due to the difficulties in serological diagnosis and the common lack of typical clinical findings, there seems to be no reason to perform routine serological studies for CMV in pregnant mothers or in women prior to planning pregnancy. The best preventive measure is appropriate immunization against CMV, but no effective immunization seems to exist as of today."

Mycosis fungoides, lymphoblastic, and CD30-positive anaplastic large T-cell NHL cases were consistently EBV-negative. Double-labeling by RISH and immunophenotyping demonstrated the presence of EBV in neoplastic T cells, but no CD21 expression was found in the EBER-positive T-NHL cases. LMP-1 was expressed in 12 of 40 (30%) EBER-positive T-NHL and 5 of 25 (20%) EBER-positive B-NHL cases. For both T- and B-NHL, no correlation was found for EBER positivity and age, sex, clinical stage, or serum level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at diagnosis. However, in T-NHL but not B-NHL, EBER positivity correlated with the presence of constitutional symptoms and a poor performance score (PS < 1; scale, 0 to 4). EBER status did not have any prognostic significance in B-NHL, but it had a negative prognostic impact in high-grade T-NHL (7-year survival of EBER-negative v EBER-positive cases: 33% v 14%; P = .01). A multivariate analysis including all B- and T-NHL of intermediate-/high-grade histology showed that EBER positivity in T-NHL was one of the three most significant factors recognized by the final prognostic model, only surpassed by PS greater than 1 and age greater than 67 years, and more powerful than B symptoms, an elevated LDH, or disseminated disease (clinical stage greater than II). We conclude that patients with EBV-positive T-NHL have a very poor clinical outcome, that EBV status should be considered as additional useful information in the classification of T-NHL, and that EBV-positive T-NHL should be treated as a separate entity in the future."
CD011926,0,8035017,0,Sensitive detection and early prognostic significance of p24 antigen in heat-denatured plasma of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected infants. Swiss Neonatal HIV Study Group.,"Immune complex formation causes underdetection of p24 antigen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Briefly boiling diluted plasma releases all complexed antigen, which can then be measured by some commercial assays. In a retrospective pediatric cohort study, the specificity of this procedure in 390 uninfected samples was 96.9% after initial testing and 100% after neutralization. Sensitivity among 125 postnatal infected samples was, at a detection of 2 pg/mL, 96.0% (97% neutralizable) compared with 47.7% for regular antigen (76% neutralizable), 96% for polymerase chain reaction, and 77% for viral culture. The high sensitivity and specificity of heat-denatured antigen was confirmed by prospectively testing 113 additional samples. Quantitative analysis of samples from infected infants showed low levels of p24 antigen in 29% of cord blood sera, a postnatal increase to levels that were during the first 6 months of life inversely associated with survival, and persistence of antigenemia thereafter independent of clinical status. Prevalence and antigen levels were significantly lower in mothers. The persistent antigenemia in children indicates that their immune systems cannot restrict HIV expression as efficiently as those of adults."

The characteristics of pediatric hMPV infection in Northern Alberta have not been studied. The objectives of this study were to determine the seasonality of pediatric hMPV infections over a 13-month period, the genetic relationship of hMPV isolates to hMPV detected in other parts of Canada, and the burden of illness and possible risk factors for pediatric hMPV hospitalization. Detection of hMPV by polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal specimens collected from outpatients and inpatients at the Stollery Children's Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta, November 12, 2002-December 31, 2003. Forty-two of 1,079 specimens were positive for hMPV (3.9%) from 41 patients (14 outpatients and 27 inpatients), with a peak incidence during January-April, but isolates were detected 10 months of the year. Co-infection was not detected in 39 specimens from which RSV had been detected. Two hMPV genetic clusters were detected, and the isolates were homologous to those of previous Canadian isolates. Four of the 14 outpatients had reactive airways disease. Possible risk factors in the 27 inpatients included prematurity (n = 8), congenital heart disease (n = 6), gastroesophageal reflux disease or aspiration (n = 6), global developmental delay (n = 5), and multiple congenital anomalies (n = 4). Risk factors for hospitalization appear to be similar to risk factors for respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization."

Late-onset GBS infection is infrequent and occurs between 1 week and 3 months of age. The transmission of GBS through the ingestion of breast milk is reported in the literature, but only a few of these cases have been confirmed by molecular techniques. In this article we report five cases of late-onset GBS disease: transmission through maternal milk was confirmed in four cases, using the random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) typing assay. In addition, the RAPD-PCR assay showed that each of the isolated clones belonged to a different RAPD genotype, thus revealing that the late-onset GBS infections were not epidemiologically related."

Although infection is usually asymptomatic, infections of the central nervous system manifested as meningitis or encephalitis can pose a serious public health problem, especially during outbreaks. In this study, samples from 218 patients diagnosed with enteroviral meningitis between January 2000 and December 2002 were analysed in order to assess the epidemiology of human enteroviruses as a cause of viral meningitis in Cyprus. A new typing strategy, based on partial sequencing of the 5' non-coding region (5'NCR), prediction of type, and selection of type-specific primers for sensitive VP1 PCR amplification, was developed. As clustering in the 5'NCR was concordant with clustering in the VP1 region, quick and reliable typing by VP1 sequencing was achieved without virus isolation in cell culture. The most frequent enterovirus serotypes identified were Human echovirus 30 (55.5%), Human echovirus 13 (15.1%), Human echovirus 6 (13.8%) and Human echovirus 9 (8.3%). Human coxsackieviruses B2, B1 and B5, Human echovirus 4, Human enterovirus 71 and Human coxsackievirus A6 represented rather rare serotypes. This is the first molecular epidemiological study of enterovirus meningitis in Cyprus. Serotype distribution corresponded basically with observations in other European countries, suggesting the spread of enteroviruses by tourism."

Valganciclovir has been shown to prevent hearing deterioration and improve neurocognitive outcomes if started in the first month of life. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of integrating testing for cCMV using salivary swabs into the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP). Parents of newborns <22 days old in South West London, who were referred after their initial newborn hearing screen for further audiological testing, were approached by hearing screeners to obtain a saliva sample for CMV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eighty percent (203/255) of newborns who were eligible had a saliva swab taken by the hearing screener. Over 99% of results were delivered within the first month of life. Two newborns were identified with cCMV and both seen on day 10 of life by the paediatric specialist. All saliva samples tested delivered a result using real-time PCR."

Acinetobacter species were found in 24 hospitals (49%) and accounted for 1.5% of all nosocomial BSIs reported. One hundred twenty-nine isolates were identified either as A. baumannii (n=111) or other Acinetobacter species (n=18). Patients with A. baumannii BSI, compared with patients with nosocomial BSI caused by other gram-negative pathogens, were more frequently observed in the intensive care unit (69% vs. 47%, respectively; P<.001; odds ratio [OR] 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-3.7) and were more frequently receiving mechanical ventilation (58% vs. 30%, respectively; P<.001; OR 3.2; 95% CI 2.1-4.8). Crude mortality in patients with A. baumannii BSI was 32%. Molecular relatedness of strains was studied by use of polymerase chain reaction-based fingerprinting. Clonal spread of a single strain occurred in 5 hospitals. Interhospital spread of epidemic A. baumannii strains was not observed. The most active antimicrobial agents against A. baumannii (90% minimum inhibitory concentration values) were imipenem (1 mg/L; 100% of isolates susceptible), amikacin (8 mg/L; 96%), tobramycin (4 mg/L; 92%), and doxycycline (4 mg/L; 91%).

All specimens were spotted onto Whatman 541 filters and hybridized with specific radiolabeled DNA probes. Enterotoxigenic E. coli was detected in 38 patients by examining colony blots, in 52 patients by examining replicate blots, and in 45 patients by examining stool blots. Enteropathogenic E. coli adhesin factor was detected in 12 patients by colony blots, in 25 patients by replicate blots, and in 16 patients by stool blots. E. coli that hybridized with the enterohemorrhagic E. coli probe was detected in 2 patients by colony blots, in 11 patients by replicate blots, and in 0 patients by stool blots. Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli was detected in 0 patients by colony blots, in 12 patients by replicate blots, and in 0 patients by stool blots. Shigella spp. were identified by standard bacteriological methods in 82 patients, and enteroinvasive E. coli was identified by colony blots in 11 patients (total, 93), by replicate blots in 56 patients, and by stool blots in 35 patients. Of 82 culture-confirmed Shigella infections, 45 were identified by examining replicate blots with the 17-kilobase-pair probe and 36 were identified by examination with the Ipa probe (P less than 0.05). Examining replicate blots with specific probes identified more enterotoxigenic E.coli (P < 0.005), enteropathogenic E.coli adhesion factor-producing E.coli (P < 0.001), and Shiga-like toxin-producing E.coli (P < 0.005) infections than examining colony blots.

However, no isolation attempts, molecular detection, or genetic studies have been carried out so far in the country. In the present study, molecular detection of circulating hMPV in children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection in Montevideo-Uruguay was carried out by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the hMPV nucleoprotein (N) gene from 217 nasopharyngeal aspirates. Genetic variability analysis of the positive samples was performed by amplification and sequencing of both N and attachment glycoprotein (G) genes. Eighteen of the 217 samples tested positive for hMPV, with tachypnea, chest indrawing, and wheezing being the main clinical symptoms recorded. Phylogenetic analysis of N and G genes showed that Uruguayan samples clustered in genotypes described previously as A2, B1, and B2, with bootstrap values >or=98%. Sublineages A2a and A2b could also be distinguished within the samples that belong to A2. This is the first molecular report on the circulation of hMPV in Uruguay. The pattern of circulation of this virus, analyzed for both N and G genes independently, resembles the complex evolutionary pattern of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)."

Cases were ascertained through review of blood culture results for the period of May 1996 through May 2002. Isolates were identified to species level with 16S rDNA and recA-based species-specific polymerase chain reaction analyses and recA restriction fragment-length polymorphism. Strain typing was performed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Fifty-three patients with B. cepacia complex bacteremia were identified; only 9 (17%) had cystic fibrosis. Twenty-five patients (47%) died within 14 days of bacteremia. After controlling for comorbid conditions and therapeutic interventions, 2 outbreak-related strains of Burkholderia cenocepacia (genomovar III) were associated with 14-day mortality (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-25.02).

The rate was higher among adults over 50 years old, without any difference in relation to sex. Positive parasitemia was found in 11.8% (2/17) of the seropositive individuals by means of indirect xenodiagnosis and in 75% (9/12) by means of the polymerase chain reaction (p < 0.05). Cardiopathy was found by means of anamnesis, physical examination and resting electrocardiogram in 41% (7/17) of the seropositive individuals and in 11.8% (2/17) of the seronegative controls (p < 0.05). Analysis of these results showed that the prevalences of positive parasitemia and chronic Chagas cardiopathy were similar to those in the Caatinga area of Piauí and greater than in the Sertão area of Paraíba, although all these areas historically presented Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata as the primary vectors responsible for Chagas infection transmission."

The subjects of the present study were three preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the General Hospital ""Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez"". The infants developed Candida parapsilosis infection on the mean age of 13.6 day of life. Prior to fungemia, infants had received assisted ventilation and hyperalimentation through central venous catheter. Sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer gene ruled out other Candida species and revealed that the eight isolates were C. parapsilosis. The isolates were examined based on their molecular relation by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. The profiles allowed the identification of two main genotypes of C. parapsilosis as the outbreak cause and as a result of the cross-infection with health care workers' hands. We conclude that C. parapsilosis commonly colonize through horizontal transmission due to the staff's noncompliance of hand hygiene procedures."

To assess the prevalence of HBoV in children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in Novosibirsk, Russia, as well as its genetic diversity and the potential role in the etiology of gastroenteritis in this region, a total of 5502 stool samples from children hospitalized with gastroenteritis from 2010 to 2012, n=5250, and healthy children, n=252, were assayed for the presence of HBoV DNA by semi-nested PCR. The HBoV DNA was found in 1.2% of stool samples from children, with gastroenteritis varying from 0.5% in 2012 to 1.7% in 2011. The prevalence of HBoV in healthy children was 0.3%. HBoV strains were detected throughout the year with an increase in the fall-winter season. In 87% of cases, HBoV was detected in children before 1 year of age. All known HBoV genetic variants have been detected in Novosibirsk, although with different prevalences: HBoV2>HBoV1>HBoV4>HBoV3. At the beginning of 2011, HBoV2 replaced HBoV1 as the most prevalent variant. The median age of children with detected HBoV1 was 8.3months, and that with HBoV2 was 8.0 months. All HBoV-positive samples were assayed for the presence of the rotaviruses A and C, norovirus GII, astrovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus F, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp., and EIEC. HBoV1 and HBoV2 as single agents were found in 45.8% and 60% samples, respectively, although this difference was not statistically significant. In the case of co-infections, HBoV was most frequently recorded with rotavirus A and norovirus GII. This study demonstrated that the detection rate of HBoV in stool samples from children with gastroenteritis was low, although both HBoV1 and HBoV2 could be found as the sole agents in children with gastroenteritis in Novosibirsk."

When serologic screening is performed early in gestation, it is possible to identify those women at risk of intrauterine transmission of the virus, i.e., those women with a primary CMV infection, who should be enrolled in prenatal diagnosis. The use of quantitative PCR on amniotic fluid from pregnant women at 21-22 weeks of gestation in prenatal diagnosis is an effective diagnostic tool to distinguish between CMV infection and CMV disease in the fetus and newborn. Quantitative PCR on peripheral blood leukocytes from CMV infected newborns can be used to monitor viral load, especially during treatment with ganciclovir.

CD011926,0,8345421,0,Identifying human immunodeficiency virus infection at birth: application of polymerase chain reaction to Guthrie cards.,"Guthrie cards containing dried blood spots from 67 children now known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 63 children now classified as having had seroreversion were retrieved from the newborn infant archives from 1986 through 1991 to determine whether the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could predict the infection at birth. The PCR assays operating at a sensitivity capable of detecting 2 to 10 copies of HIV proviral DNA per microgram were able to detect HIV proviral DNA in 52% (35/67) of the infected neonatal blood specimens. Longer storage times did not decrease PCR positivity rates, an advantage over assays for HIV antibody. Children whose clinical progression has been aggressive had high rates of PCR positivity in neonatal specimens, 50% (7/14) in those with low CD4 cell counts during the first year of life, 71% (10/14) in those with Pneumocystis pneumonia or disseminated cytomegalovirus infection by age 1 year, 62% (18/29) in those with onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by 18 months, and 66% (14/21) in those who died of the disease by 36 months of age. No evidence of HIV proviral DNA was found in any of the 63 specimens from children with seroreversion. We conclude that PCR, using routinely available dried blood spots from neonates, has applications in early diagnosis and in epidemiologic projections going beyond current seroprevalence studies."
CD011926,0,2563254,0,Molecular epidemiology of adhesin and hemolysin virulence factors among uropathogenic Escherichia coli.,"The pap, prs, pil, and hly operons of the pyelonephritic Escherichia coli isolate J96 code for the expression of P, F, and type 1 adhesins and the production of hemolysin, respectively; the afaI operon of the pyelonephritic E. coli KS52 encodes an X adhesin. Using different segments of these operons as probes, colony hybridizations were performed on 97 E. coli urinary tract and 40 fecal clinical isolates to determine (i) the presence in the infecting bacteria of nucleotide sequences related to virulence operons, and (ii) the phenotypic properties associated with such sequences. Coexpression of P and F adhesins encoded by pap-related sequences was detected more frequently among isolates from patients with pyelonephritis (32 of 49, 65%) than among those with cystitis (11 of 48, 23%; P less than 0.0001) or from fecal specimens (6 of 40, 15%; P less than 0.0001). Therefore, the expression of both adhesins appears to be critical in the colonization of the upper urinary tract. In contrast, afaI-related sequences were detected significantly more frequently among isolates from patients with cystitis, suggesting that this class of X adhesin may have a role in lower urinary tract infections. Urinary tract isolates differed from fecal isolates by a low incidence of type 1 adhesin expression among pil probe-positive isolates. hly-related sequences were only detected in pap probe-positive isolates. The frequency of hemolysin production among pap probe-positive isolates was not associated with a particular pattern of infection. The distribution of these virulence factors was similar in the presence or absence of reflux, indicating that structural abnormalities of the urinary tract did not facilitate colonization by adhesin-negative isolates."

Results from real-time polymerase chain reaction and 16S on CSF specimens were concordant with hospital microbiology findings in 80%; however, other pathogenic organisms were detected in 14 culture-negative specimens. New York City's surveillance system appears to be effective at capturing cases of Nm meningitis. Nucleic acid testing is useful for detecting the presence of bacterial DNA when antibiotic therapy precedes lumbar puncture or bacterial cultures are negative. It remains unanswered whether culture-negative cases of Nm bacteremia are being missed by reportable disease surveillance."

However, the value of RTQ-PCR for predicting clinical outcomes of malaria is unknown. Here, we compared RTQ-PCR to microscopy of blood smears, nested PCR (nPCR), and parasite circulating-antigen (CAg) assays for detection of Plasmodium falciparum in pregnant Kenyan women and their infants and related these findings to parity and birth weights in their newborns (n = 554). nPCR was the most sensitive assay for detection of malaria in pregnancy, followed in decreasing order of sensitivity by RTQ-PCR, CAg assays, and blood smears. RTQ-PCR detected a higher frequency of malaria infection (46%) in maternal peripheral blood in primiparous than in multiparous women (35%; P < 0.001), with a >12-fold difference in parasite burden (geometric mean = 25,870 versus 2,143 amplicons/microl blood; P < 0.0001). Similarly, the presence of placental malaria determined by RTQ-PCR was approximately twofold higher in primiparous versus multiparous women (21% versus 13%; P < 0.01). The presence and intensity of malaria infection in pregnant women estimated by RTQ-PCR strongly correlated with low-birth-weight babies, especially in those with high amplicon numbers. RTQ-PCR identified malaria-infected women, missed by blood smear, who were at risk for having underweight offspring. By contrast, malaria detected by nPCR and CAg assay showed a much weaker association with parity or low birth weight. Thus, RTQ-PCR provides an estimate of parasite burden that is more sensitive than blood smear and is predictive of clinical outcomes of malaria infection in pregnant women and newborns."

Reports now show the predominance of individual species recovered from normal skin and from patients with diseases such as pityriasis versicolor and seborrhoeic dermatitis. The majority of systemic infections reported have been in the bloodstream of premature neonates. Clusters of cases have occurred and molecular techniques employed to study the epidemiology. With the development of discriminatory methods to determine individual species and strains present in disease and in nature, our understanding of the pathogenicity and the epidemiology of this genus can be advanced."
CD011926,0,17316500,0,"Importance of the detection of amoebic antigens in stool samples for the diagnosis of Entamoeba histolytica infection, among children in southern Turkey.","Entamoeba histolytica is the predominant causative agent of human amoebiasis, a significant and common diarrhoeal disease among children of developing countries. Diagnosis of this illness by the microscopical detection of the parasites in stool samples is insensitive and often incapable of differentiating the pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica from the commensal parasite E. dispar. In this study, the results of testing stool samples in an ELISA, based on a monoclonal antibody, that detects E. histolytica-specific galactose adhesin were compared against the results of the microscopical examination of the same samples. The samples investigated came from 131 children (aged<15 years) with diarrhoea, who lived in the provinces of Adana and Mersin, in southern Turkey. Overall 22 cases of E. histolytica infection, including eight that appeared negative by microscopy, were detected using the ELISA. The 16 patients considered positive for E. histolytica/E. dispar by microscopy included two who were ELISA-negative. With the ELISA results used as the 'gold standard', and assuming that all the E. histolytica/E. dispar cysts seen by microscopy were E. histolytica, microscopy had a specificity of 98.2%, a positive predictive value of 87.5% and a negative predictive value of 93.1% but a sensitivity of only 63.6%. Compared with microscopy, culture and PCR-based assays, the antigen-detection ELISA appears to be easier, faster and probably more cost-effective, with high sensitivity, specificity and predictive values."

CD011926,0,25526999,0,Molecular genotyping and quantitation assay for rotavirus surveillance.,"Rotavirus genotyping is useful for surveillance purposes especially in areas where rotavirus vaccination has been or will be implemented. RT-PCR based molecular methods have been applied widely, but quantitative assays targeting a broad spectrum of genotypes have not been developed. Three real time RT-PCR panels were designed to identify G1, G2, G9, G12 (panel GI), G3, G4, G8, G10 (panel GII), and P[4], P[6], P[8], P[10], P[11] (panel P), respectively. An assay targeting NSP3 was included in both G panels as an internal control. The cognate assays were also formulated as one RT-PCR-Luminex panel for simultaneous detection of all the genotypes listed above plus P[9]. The assays were evaluated with various rotavirus isolates and 89 clinical samples from Virginia, Bangladesh and Tanzania, and exhibited 95% (81/85) sensitivity compared with the conventional RT-PCR-Gel-electrophoresis method, and 100% concordance with sequencing. Real time assays identified a significantly higher rate of mixed genotypes in Bangladeshi samples than the conventional gel-electrophoresis-based RT-PCR assay (32.5% versus 12.5%, P<0.05). In these mixed infections, the relative abundance of the rotavirus types could be estimated by Cq values. These typing assays detect and discriminate a broad range of G/P types circulating in different geographic regions with high sensitivity and specificity and can be used for rotavirus surveillance."
CD011926,0,23284886,0,Population distribution of Beta-lactamase conferring resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in human clinical Enterobacteriaceae in the Netherlands.,"There is a global increase in infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae with plasmid-borne β-lactamases that confer resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. The epidemiology of these bacteria is not well understood, and was, therefore, investigated in a selection of 636 clinical Enterobacteriaceae with a minimal inhibitory concentration >1 mg/L for ceftazidime/ceftriaxone from a national survey (75% E. coli, 11% E. cloacae, 11% K. pneumoniae, 2% K. oxytoca, 2% P. mirabilis). Isolates were investigated for extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and ampC genes using microarray, PCR, gene sequencing and molecular straintyping (Diversilab and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)). ESBL genes were demonstrated in 512 isolates (81%); of which 446 (87%) belonged to the CTX-M family. Among 314 randomly selected and sequenced isolates, bla(CTX-M-15) was most prevalent (n = 124, 39%), followed by bla(CTX-M-1) (n = 47, 15%), bla(CTX-M-14) (n = 15, 5%), bla(SHV-12) (n = 24, 8%) and bla(TEM-52) (n = 13, 4%). Among 181 isolates with MIC ≥16 mg/L for cefoxitin plasmid encoded AmpCs were detected in 32 and 27 were of the CMY-2 group. Among 102 E. coli isolates with MIC ≥16 mg/L for cefoxitin ampC promoter mutations were identified in 29 (28%). Based on Diversilab genotyping of 608 isolates (similarity cut-off >98%) discriminatory indices of bacteria with ESBL and/or ampC genes were 0.994, 0.985 and 0.994 for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae, respectively. Based on similarity cut-off >95% two large clusters of E. coli were apparent (of 43 and 30 isolates) and 21 of 21 that were typed by belonged to ST131 of which 13 contained bla(CTX-M-15). Our findings demonstrate that bla(CTX-M-15) is the most prevalent ESBL and we report a larger than previously reported prevalence of ampC genes among Enterobacteriaceae responsible for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins."

CD011926,0,11039673,0,"Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites is not an allergic disease, but an Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease.","Recently, we showed that 5 cases of hypersensitivity to mosquito bites (HMB) concealed the clonal lymphoproliferation of Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA-positive natural killer (NK) cells. Although the symptoms of HMB have been supposed to derive from Arthus phenomenon, it has become apparent that this unique disorder has the potential to develop into so-called malignant histiocytosis (MH) or related disorders. Accordingly, the criteria for MH have been changed, and a newer diagnostic name, hemophagocytic syndrome, has been described as being associated with viral infection or leukemia/lymphoma. We previously reported that biopsy specimens taken from skin lesions demonstrated infiltration of lymphocytes bearing the phenotype of NK cells. In this study, we found that skin lesions exhibited infiltration of atypical lymphocytes around the small vessels, resembling angiocentric lymphoma, and that these infiltrating cells were positive for EBER-1 by in situ hybridization. These findings support the concept that HMB is the most important manifestation of a certain type of lymphoproliferative disease that presents with an intense local skin reaction and high fever following mosquito bites, and whose essence is the lymphoproliferation of EBV DNA-positive NK cells."
CD011926,0,1640950,0,[Perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission].,"Using the highly sensitive Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA has already been detected in many patients negative for all other serological HBV markers [12]. But yet, the relevance of these findings as a marker of infectivity has not been determined. We therefore have used the PCR to examine the perinatal route of HBV transmission by testing sera from 109 mother-child pairs in Yaoundé, Cameroon. HBV-DNA was detected in 25 (23%) of the mother's sera from which only 5 were positive for HBsAg. At the age of 6 months only one baby out of 25 who could be retested had become positive for HBV-DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg. Low serum HBV-DNA levels which are still detectable by the PCR therefore seem not to be associated with a high risk of perinatal HBV transmission."
CD011926,0,17426887,0,Astrovirus infection in children living in the Central West region of Brazil.,"This study presents data regarding the circulation of astrovirus in Goiânia-GO and Brasília-DF. These viruses were detected in fecal samples from hospitalized children up to five years old with and without acute gastroenteritis. A total of 1244 fecal samples were collected in two periods, 1994 to 1996 (Brasília) and 1998 to 2002 (Goiânia and Brasília), and were analyzed for viral RNA using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Positivity rates of 4.3 and 0.5% for astrovirus were observed in children with acute gastroenteritis and those without gastroenteritis, respectively. Among children with gastroenteritis no statistically significant difference was seen with regards to viral positivity rates in relation to gender and age. However, a higher incidence rate was observed for children from Brasília aged 36 months or more. Overall, astroviruses occurred predominantly from September to March in the two cities, suggesting a seasonal pattern for these viruses which coincides with the highest relative air humidity period. The results of this study highlight the importance of astrovirus as an etiologic agent of acute gastroenteritis in children of the Central West region of Brazil."

Therefore, 767 pregnant women were screened for anti-HCV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HIV antibodies. HCV PCR was performed for HCV-positive women. Those who were PCR-positive were tested for anti-HCV IgM. Neonates of PCR-positive mothers were tested for virus transmission by the PCR test. Virus serotyping was done for mothers and neonates. Anti-HCV antibodies were detected in 105 out of 767 (13.7%) pregnant women. PCR was positive in 18 out of 67 HCV-positive women (26.9%). Transplacental transmission occurred in 11.1% of HIV-negative pregnant women. HCV type 4 predominates in Egypt (83.3%). Mothers who are PCR-positive and have high aspartate aminotransferase and positive anti-HCV IgM are most likely to transmit HCV to their babies."

Adenovirus (Adv) is one of the most common causes of viral ARI, and thus calls for specific diagnosis and better understanding of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics. Our aims were to find out the status of Adv infection in children <14 years with ARI, analyze the epidemiology and clinical characteristics among the Adv-infected children in Guangzhou, China, and to provide some basis for the research of Adv. The throat and pharyngeal swabs were collected among the children with acute respiratory tract infections in outpatient department from September 2006 to August 2008. The samples were analyzed by PCR and the sequences were blasted with the sequences of Adv in GenBank. Clinical data were analyzed along with virological data by using appropriate statistical methods. Adv was detected in 25 out of 512 (4.9%) children. The genome types of 23 samples were determined after analysis of the gene sequence. The most prevalent Adv type was species B type 3. Among the patients, 10 were of Ad3 (43.5%), three were of Ad1 (1.3%), five were of species C Ad2 (21.7%), and five were of species E Ad4 (21.7%). A higher incidence of positive results was found during the summer season, thus showing a pattern of seasonality. There exists Adv infection in children with acute respiratory system diseases in Guangzhou area. No significant differences were found among different age groups and gender groups. Co-infections with other respiratory virus were detected in 64% of the Adv positive samples."

Polymerase chain reaction methodology has been used to diagnose different bacterial, viral and protozoal infections, and the possibility of amplifying the DNA region common to all bacteria could represent an optimal method for the diagnosis of sepsis. The authors have performed PCR in a group of 33 neonates at risk for early-onset sepsis, correlating molecular data with blood culture results. The presence of bacterial DNA in blood samples was evaluated, amplifying the DNA region encoding the 16S rRNA. There were no false negative results (four positive blood cultures and four positive PCR), with competitive costs and time. This method also allows the diagnosis of sepsis due to uncommon species and also, using a second PCR with specific primers, an aetiological diagnosis."

CD011926,0,12843031,0,Human metapneumovirus associated with respiratory tract infections in a 3-year study of nasal swabs from infants in Italy.,"The newly described human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is reported here to be more commonly associated with lower respiratory tract disease. The present study examined nasal swab specimens from 90 infants with acute respiratory tract infections in Pisa, Italy, over a period of three respiratory virus seasons. The incidence of infection varied in each of the 3 years, with the rates of positivity for hMPV being 7% in 2001 but 37 and 43% in 2000 and 2002, respectively. hMPV was noted to occur seasonally in a pattern typical of the frequency of occurrence of respiratory syncytial virus. More than one-half (14 of 23) of the infants infected with hMPV had bronchopneumonia. One-third (9 of 23) of the hMPV-infected patients were also infected with another respiratory virus, a relationship that has not previously been reported. Mixed infections did not account for a higher percentage of cases of bronchopneumonia than hMPV infection alone did. Furthermore, 7 of 17 infants whose plasma was also tested for hMPV RNA were demonstrated to have virus in both nasal swab and blood specimens. The study indicates that hMPV is seen as commonly as other respiratory viruses, may be associated with severe respiratory disease in infants, can establish mixed infections with other respiratory viruses, and has a seasonal occurrence."

A total of 410 nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken for detection of Bordetella pertussis/parapertussis. The age groups of the patients were 0-4 months (n=201), >4 -12 months (n=49), 1-4 years (n=79), 5-9 years (n=46), 10-14 years (n=27) and >15 years (n=8). 106 (26%) of all samples were positive for B. pertussis/parapertussis by the PCR method. The Bordetella PCR positivity rates were 36% in 2010, 29% in 2011, 15% in 2012 and 15% in 2013. Due to administration of the DTaP-IPV vaccination at seven years of age starting in 2010, pertussis was not detected in the 5-9 age group after that year.

We recorded the symptoms of adults and children with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, took nasal swabs, and sampled touched surfaces and room air. Forty-two infected subjects were followed up. The mean duration of virus shedding was 6.2 days by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and 4.2 days by culture. Surface swabs were collected from 39 settings; 16 (41%) subject locations were contaminated with virus. Overall, 33 of the 671 (4.9%) surface swabs were PCR positive for influenza, of which two (0.3%) yielded viable virus. On illness Day 3, subjects yielding positive surface samples had significantly higher nasal viral loads (geometric mean ratio 25.7; 95% CI 1.75, 376.0, p=0.021) and a positive correlation (r=0.47, p=0.006) was observed between subject nasal viral loads and viral loads recovered from the surfaces around them. Room air was sampled in the vicinity of 12 subjects, and PCR positive samples were obtained for five (42%) samples. Influenza virus shed by infected subjects did not detectably contaminate the vast majority of surfaces sampled. We question the relative importance of the indirect contact transmission of influenza via surfaces, though our data support the existence of super-spreaders via this route. The air sampling results add to the accumulating evidence that supports the potential for droplet nuclei (aerosol) transmission of influenza."

A mother who is seronegative before conception but acquires infection during pregnancy is a risk factor for congenital infection. We describe a neonate in whom congenital CMV infection was diagnosed at birth and confirmed with DNA quantitation by means of the polymerase chain reaction, was accompanied by cerebral ventriculomegaly and severe hearing loss, and was treated with ganciclovir/valganciclovir for 6 weeks. Initially, cerebral ventriculomegaly and calcification were also found with computed tomography, and severe hearing loss was detected with auditory brainstem response testing. After treatment, CMV DNA decreased in copy number and became undetectable. No marked side effects occurred after treatment. Surprisingly, 1 year after treatment, neurological and motor development was equivalent to that in a healthy infant. Audiometry indicated that auditory ability would improve with rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and cochlear implantation. Single-photon emission computed tomography showed marked improvement 6 months after treatment. This case provides compelling evidence that a reliable diagnosis of congenital CMV infections coupled with a prompt and appropriate treatment program can prevent permanent disability. It is, therefore, important to establish a more effective strategy for the management of congenital CMV infection."

We also determined the prevalence of antibodies to HTLV-I/II in siblings born to seropositive mothers. Antibodies to HTLV-I/II were detected by Western blot, and the proviral DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The risk of seroconversion to anti-HTLV-I for the 4 years of follow-up was 17.5 percent. Anti-HTLV-I/II and proviral DNA were only detected after age 18 months. We observed a seroprevalence rate of 15 percent among the siblings born to HTLV-I/II seropositive mothers. Furthermore, we report a case of mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-II infection in a population of HTLV-II-infected pregnant women that is emerging in Gabon. The lack of detection of HTLV-I/II proviral DNA in cord blood and amniotic fluid and, furthermore, the late seroconversion observed in the children indirectly indicate that mother-to-child transmission occurred postnatally, probably through breast milk."

Most isolates were found to belong to human enterovirus type A (HEV-A) and HEV-B (18 isolates of each). All HEV-A isolates could be typed by sequencing, with CV (coxsackievirus)-A16 and EV (enterovirus)-71 being dominant (nine and seven isolates, respectively). These types thus seem to have diverged more from their prototypes than the other types. Among the HEV-B isolates, E-18 dominated with five isolates that became typable after filtration. The virus type obtained by molecular typing was verified for 28 of the other patient isolates by neutralization using high-titre monovalent antisera or LBM pools. Twenty-two of the other 30 'untypable' isolates had substitutions in the VP1 protein within or close to the BC loop. Two closely related HEV-B isolates diverged by 19.4 % from E-15, the most similar prototype. Two non-neutralizable HEV-C isolates split off from the CV-A13/CV-A18 branch, from which they diverged by 15.7-18.2 %.

The complete VP1 was therefore sequenced and found to diverge by >29 % from all prototypes and by >28 % from each other. Strains similar to W553-130/99 that have been identified in the USA are tentatively designated EV-74. The two other isolates fulfil the molecular criterion for being new types. Since strains designated EV-75 and EV-76 have been identified in the USA, we have proposed the tentative designations EV-77 and EV-78 for these two new members of HEV-B."

To investigate if WU virus is related to acute respiratory infections in infants and children in Beijing, specimens collected from 674 pediatric patients with ARI from April 2007 to May 2008 and from 202 children without ARI were used for this investigation. Common respiratory viruses were tested by virus isolation and/or antigen detection by indirect immunofluorescent assay followed by RT-PCR or PCR for other viruses associated with respiratory infections in specimens collected from patients with ARI before WU virus DNA was detected. WU virus DNA was detected by initial screening and secondary confirmation PCR for all specimens. The region encoding the VP2 gene of the virus was amplified from 17 WU-virus-positive clinical specimens, and sequence analysis was performed. Thirty-eight of 674 (5.6%) specimens from patients with ARI and 3 of 202 (1.5%) specimens from children without ARI yielded PCR products with the predicted molecular weight, using either screening or confirmation primer sets, indicating that these specimens were WU virus positive. However, more than 60% of the 38 WU-virus-positive specimens from patients with ARI were also positive for one or more respiratory viruses. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the region encoding the VP2 gene from 17 Beijing WU viruses shared high homology (>98.5%) with sequences from GenBank and among themselves. The data indicated that WU virus in Beijing occurred 3.7 times more frequently in pediatric patients with ARI than in those without ARI (p < 0.05)."
CD011926,0,15258832,0,Laboratory detection of group B Streptococcus for prevention of perinatal disease.,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) or Streptococcus agalactiae emerged in the 1970s as the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Today, GBS remains one of the leading causes of sepsis and meningitis in newborns despite important prevention efforts, including the issuance of recommendations for prevention of perinatal GBS disease by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1996/1997. The gastrointestinal tract is the natural human reservoir for GBS and is the likely source of vaginal colonization. GBS disease in newborns usually results from ascending spread of GBS into the amniotic fluid, which leads to neonatal colonization and to invasive disease in some infants. This review analyzes the various laboratory methods available for the detection of GBS from clinical samples collected from pregnant women and will discuss their impact in the prevention of neonatal GBS infections and in the rationalization of antibiotic use. The recent commercial availability of a rapid and highly sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay suitable for the specific detection of GBS from vagino-rectal samples obtained from pregnant women during delivery, which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, provides improvements in the accuracy and rapidity of GBS colonization screening compared to the standard culture-based method using the recommended selective enrichment broth."
CD011926,0,23805203,0,Optimization of Multiple Pathogen Detection Using the TaqMan Array Card: Application for a Population-Based Study of Neonatal Infection.,"Identification of etiology remains a significant challenge in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly in resource-poor settings. Viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens, as well as parasites, play a role for many syndromes, and optimizing a single diagnostic system to detect a range of pathogens is challenging. The TaqMan Array Card (TAC) is a multiple-pathogen detection method that has previously been identified as a valuable technique for determining etiology of infections and holds promise for expanded use in clinical microbiology laboratories and surveillance studies. We selected TAC for use in the Aetiology of Neonatal Infection in South Asia (ANISA) study for identifying etiologies of severe disease in neonates in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Here we report optimization of TAC to improve pathogen detection and overcome technical challenges associated with use of this technology in a large-scale surveillance study. Specifically, we increased the number of assay replicates, implemented a more robust RT-qPCR enzyme formulation, and adopted a more efficient method for extraction of total nucleic acid from blood specimens. We also report the development and analytical validation of ten new assays for use in the ANISA study. Based on these data, we revised the study-specific TACs for detection of 22 pathogens in NP/OP swabs and 12 pathogens in blood specimens as well as two control reactions (internal positive control and human nucleic acid control) for each specimen type. The cumulative improvements realized through these optimization studies will benefit ANISA and perhaps other studies utilizing multiple-pathogen detection approaches. These lessons may also contribute to the expansion of TAC technology to the clinical setting."

There were no discrepancies between RAPD-Alfa patterns and serotypes found in 18 food isolates and 18 clinical isolates. The results of our study suggest that the food isolates typed were not at the origin of the human cases in western Austria. Using RAPD-Alfa, it was possible to link 9 out of 16 ""sporadic"" Listeria infections (mother-child cases counted as one) to the occurrence of other cases. Our results underline the necessity of epidemiological clarification of listeriosis cases as a prerequisite for specific preventive measures by public health services (e.g. confiscation of contaminated food products, issue of public warnings). To establish the chain of infection, more is needed than just speciation of bacteria in incriminated food products. Automated laser fluorescence analysis of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA seems a suitable, easy and rapid method for the typing of Listeria monocytogenes strains."

All 184 babies born of genome-negative mothers have no congenital disorder, while 2 out of 7 genome-positive babies have a congenital disorder (28.6%). Rubella virus was not transmitted across the placenta when infection occurred prior to gestation. Transmission rate increased to a maximum level during the first trimester and declined to 0% until 20 weeks of gestation.

Survival and cross-sectional analyses were used to estimate the timing of initial PCR positivity and subsequent PCR negativity in infected infants, and maternal antibody loss in uninfected infants was estimated as a weighted average of individual study findings. Of 74 eligible infants with strong evidence of HCV infection, an estimated 89% (90% confidence interval, 80-95%) were first PCR positive by 3 months of age, and less than 10% had subsequent PCR negativity attributable to intermittent viraemia or resolved infection in the first 18 months of life. The negative predictive value of PCR at 3 months of age was greater than 98% at an assumed rate of 5% vertical transmission, but as low as 88% at 25% transmission. The inclusion of 22 infants, each with a single PCR-positive result, increased the estimated frequency of resolved infections but made little difference to other estimates. A minority of PCR-positive infants had periods of antibody negativity by second- or third-generation assays, and among 297 uninfected infants, maternal antibody was not detected beyond 18 months. Thus, the majority of infected infants may be persistently PCR positive from 3 months of age, and the negative predictive value of PCR at 3 months is generally high. However, poor repeatability of PCR, inadequate infant follow-up, and inclusion of postnatally infected infants limits interpretation of the pooled data. Further studies using standardised PCR methodologies are needed."

CD011926,0,9738993,0,Herpes simplex virus.,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is prevalent worldwide. Herpes labialis, caused predominantly by HSV-1, and herpes vulvovaginitis, caused predominantly by HSV-2, may result in significant morbidity and mortality for infected neonates exposed during delivery. The diagnosis of HSV infection is made by serological testing, viral culture, or polymerase chain reaction. Women with primary herpes vulvovaginitis exhibit a painful vesicular rash which is self-limited but may be followed by multiple recurrences. Women at greatest risk to transmit HSV to their neonates are those who experience their first episode of HSV during the latter stage of pregnancy. If infected, their neonates may have localized skin, eye and mucosal lesions, invasive central nervous system infection, or disseminated disease. Because of the potentially devastating outcome for a baby infected with HSV, pregnant women with active HSV lesions at delivery should be offered a cesarean section. Still, many neonates who are infected with HSV are born to women with asymptomatic HSV shedding. Therefore, prevention of HSV during pregnancy is exceedingly important."

The infant had clinical, laboratory, and radiographic abnormalities consistent with congenital syphilis, ie, a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test titer that was fourfold greater than was the maternal titer, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, pneumonitis, osteochondritis of the long bones, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showing a reactive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test, pleocytosis, and elevated protein content. The infant died on the third day of life, and an autopsy revealed an evolving gumma of the anterior pituitary. Immunoglobulin M immunoblotting of serum and CSF was positive, and polymerase chain reaction detected Treponema pallidum DNA in endotracheal aspirate and CSF. This case highlights the pathologic abnormalities observed in congenital syphilis and focuses on the rare finding of an evolving anterior pituitary gumma. Furthermore, it documents the failure of maternal syphilis treatment during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy to cure fetal infection and supports the recommendation that all infants born to mothers with syphilis treated during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy should receive penicillin therapy."

Umbilical cord blood was collected at birth, and DNA was extracted to screen for CMV DNA by real-time PCR. Head MRI and a developmental test were conducted for two cases (0.2%) in which CMV DNA was detected. Neither case showed clear abnormalities at birth, and head CT conducted at 1 month after birth revealed no abnormalities. Auditory brainstem responses were normal at both 1 and 12 months after birth in both cases. Head MRI at 12 months showed abnormalities in both cases. For both cases, development tests conducted at 12 months revealed mild developmental delays, particularly in posture and movement areas, which might have been caused by congenital CMV infection."

Although viral infection may be suspected in either of these clinical conditions, the definitive etiology is often difficult to ascertain. Furthermore, the histology is identical for both disorders. Coxsackievirus has long been considered the most common cause of viral myocarditis; however, we previously demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis that many different, and sometimes unexpected, viruses may be responsible for myocarditis and cardiac rejection. In this study, we describe the association of parvovirus genome identified through PCR analysis of cardiac tissue in the clinical setting of myocarditis and cardiac allograft rejection."

A large proportion of infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for suspected sepsis receive treatment with potent systemic antibiotics while a diagnostic workup is in progress. The gold standard for detecting bacterial sepsis is blood culture. However, as pathogens in blood cultures are only detected in approximately 25% of patients, the sensitivity of blood culture is suspected to be low. Therefore, the diagnosis of sepsis is often based on the development of clinical signs, in combination with laboratory tests such as a rise in C-reactive protein (CRP). Molecular assays for the detection of bacterial DNA in the blood represent possible new diagnostic tools for early identification of a bacterial cause."

The serological responses of another group of rotavirus-positive neonates studied previously at the ""Maternidad Concepcion Palacios"" (MCP) hospital was also evaluated. Fifty-four of 266 (20%) newborns examined at HMIC shed rotavirus. The infection rate was higher among infants admitted to the nursery (75%) than in those ""rooming in"" with their mothers (7%) (P < .01). Eleven of the 54 neonates (20%) had diarrhea; seven of them experienced mild, short-lived episodes, whereas five had frequent diarrhea bouts or diarrhea lasting for over 3 days; the remaining 43 infants were asymptomatic. Twenty-seven of 28 rotavirus specimens tested at HMIC had VP7 serotype 4 specificity and one belonged to VP7 serotype 1; VP4 typing performed on 24 of the viruses by RNA hybridization showed these viruses to be similar to the M37 strain, a rotavirus previously associated with asymptomatic infections in newborns at MCP. IgA seroresponses were detected in eight of 11 infants born at HMIC (73%), but most failed to developed neutralization responses to homologous or heterologous strains. Newborn infants who had shed the M37 rotavirus strain at MCP reacted similarly: 16 of 24 (67%) developed a rotavirus IgA rise, but only 29% developed a neutralization response."
CD011926,0,16517846,0,Sensitivities of antigen detection and PCR assays greatly increased compared to that of the standard culture method for screening for group B streptococcus carriage in pregnant women.,"Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of serious infections in neonates. The 2002 revised guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the prevention of perinatal GBS disease recommend that all pregnant women be screened for GBS carriage at between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation and that intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis be given to carriers. We studied the performances of four different GBS detection assays in the context of antenatal screening. Between May and August 2004, the 605 vaginorectal swab specimens received at our bacteriology laboratory for GBS antenatal detection were tested by the four assays. The standard culture method was done according to the CDC recommendations. The three experimental assays performed with the growth from the selective enrichment (LIM) broth (Todd-Hewitt broth with 15 mug/ml nalidixic acid and 10 mug/ml colistin) after overnight incubation were a GBS antigen detection assay (PathoDx) and two PCR assays (for cfb and scpB). The most accurate assay was the scpB PCR (sensitivity, 99.6%; specificity, 100%), followed by the cfb PCR (sensitivity, 75.3%; specificity, 100%), GBS antigen detection (sensitivity, 57.3%; specificity, 99.5%), and standard culture (sensitivity, 42.3%; specificity, 100%). The GBS antigen detection assay was found to be more sensitive than the standard culture method, and moreover, the assay has a low cost and is easy to perform in all obstetrical centers which have access to the most basic of diagnostic microbiology services. We believe that antigen detection on incubated LIM broth should replace the standard culture method for screening for GBS carriage at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation. The impact of the greater sensitivities of PCR assays on the diminution of neonatal GBS infections remains to be demonstrated."

CD011926,0,23341915,0,Distortions in development of intestinal microbiota associated with late onset sepsis in preterm infants.,"Late onset sepsis (LOS) is a major contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality, especially in premature infants. Distortions in the establishment of normal gut microbiota, commensal microbes that colonize the digestive tract, might increase the risk of LOS via disruption of the mucosal barrier with resultant translocation of luminal contents. Correlation of distortions of the intestinal microbiota with LOS is a necessary first step to design novel microbiota-based screening approaches that might lead to early interventions to prevent LOS in high risk infants. Using a case/control design nested in a cohort study of preterm infants, we analyzed stool samples that had been prospectively collected from ten preterm infants with LOS and from 18 matched controls. A 16S rRNA based approach was utilized to compare microbiota diversity and identify specific bacterial signatures that differed in their prevalence between cases and controls. Overall α-diversity (Chao1) was lower in cases two weeks before (p<0.05) but not one week before or at the time of diagnosis of LOS. Overall microbiota structure (Unifrac) appeared distinct in cases 2 weeks and 1 week before but not at diagnosis (p<0.05). Although we detected few operational taxonomic units (OTUs) unique or enriched in cases, we found many OTUs common in controls that were lacking in cases (p<0.01). Bifidobacteria counts were lower in cases at all time points. Our results support the hypothesis that a distortion in normal microbiota composition, and not an enrichment of potential pathogens, is associated with LOS in preterm infants."

CD011926,0,11878718,0,Chlamydia trachomatis infection in mothers with preterm delivery and in their newborn infants.,We studied Chlamydia trachomatis infection in mothers with preterm delivery and intrauterine transmission of the infection to their offspring. Forty-one mothers with preterm labour and their newborn infants (n=50) were studied for the presence of C. trachomatis infection using microimmunofluorescence test for detection of serum antibodies against C trachomatis and polymerase chain reaction for detection of C. trachomatis-specific DNA in mucosal swabs. Antibodies to C trachomatis were found in serum of 12 mothers (29%). Five of fourteen mothers had C. trachomatis DNA in cervical specimens. Eighteen neonates were born to the 14 mothers with positive serology and/or C. trachomatis DNA. C. trachomatis DNA was detected in specimens from 10 of the 18 neonates (55.5%). Three of the available cord blood samples contained C trachomatis IgM antibodies. Our results strongly suggest that mothers and their preterm babies may benefit from screening for active C. trachomatis infection.

By use of flow cytometry, transient high-level TCR beta-chain variable region-specific expansions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed more frequently in HIV-infected children than in children exposed to HIV who remained uninfected. TCR beta-chain diversity analysis and diversity-specific polymerase chain reaction were used to study the clonality of expanded CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. In CD8+ T cells, structural features of the complement-determining regions 3 were altered during the course of the expansion, and persistent TCR clonotypes were observed, consistent with antigen-driven selection. In contrast, TCR beta-chain variable region-specific expansions without clonotypic overrepresentation or persistence were observed in CD4+ T cells, possibly related to HIV-specific helper T cell responses or to the progressive destruction of the CD4+ cell compartment."

Since standard culture methods of U. urealyticum are difficult to perform, new rapid and sensitive methods are needed to detect lung infection of ventilated newborns. Here we describe the polymerase chain reaction as a rapid method to screen endotracheal aspirates for ureaplasma infection. Urease-specific sequences could only be detected in 1 out of 36 ventilated newborns. The procedure described in this paper may facilitate further studies to determine the role of U. urealyticum in development of BPD."

CD011926,0,12646635,0,Conservation of nonpeptide antigen recognition by rhesus monkey V gamma 2V delta 2 T cells.,"We have previously found that monkey Vgamma2Vdelta2(+) T cells mount adaptive immune responses in response to Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin infections. We have now analyzed rhesus monkey gammadelta T cell responses to nonpeptide Ags and superantigens. Like human Vgamma2Vdelta2(+) T cells, rhesus monkey gammadelta T cells are stimulated when exposed to prenyl pyrophosphate, bisphosphonate, and alkylamine Ags. Responsiveness was limited to gammadelta T cells expressing Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCRs. Rhesus monkey Vgamma2Vdelta2(+) T cells also responded to the superantigen, staphyloccocal enterotoxin A. Sequencing of the rhesus monkey Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCR revealed a strong sequence homology to human Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCR that preserves important sequence motifs. Moreover, chimeric TCRs that pair human Vgamma2 with monkey Vdelta2 and monkey Vgamma2 with human Vdelta2 retain reactivity to nonpeptide Ags and B cell lymphomas. A molecular model of the rhesus monkey Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCR has a basic region in the complementarity-determining region 3 binding groove that is similar to that seen in the human Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCR and preserves the topology of the complementarity-determining region loops. Thus, recognition of nonpeptide prenyl pyrophosphate, bisphosphonate, and alkylamine Ags is conserved in primates suggesting that primates can provide an animal model for human gammadelta T cell Ag responses."

The methods used were enzyme immunoassay, immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. The babies were divided as follows: newborn infants (group I), babies aged 1-3 months (group II), 4-6 months (group III) and 7-12 months (group IV). Specific clinical features of CMV infection in newborn infants were studied on 69 cases (37--with CMV monoinfection and 32--with mixed infection). The serological screening revealed a 2.1-fold growth of the infection rate among randomly selected newborn infants during the 10 year period. Positive correlation between the infection rate among children of this age group and the neonatal mortality rate was established. High risk factors of CMV infection were revealed as well as increased infection rate and frequency of clinical cases with the prevailing neurological pathology in group III. Early diagnosis, the exclusion of mixed infections and early adequate therapy were shown to play a decisive role in the outcome of the disease. The algorithm of epidemiological surveillance and the regional program of prophylaxis were worked out."
CD011926,0,21647616,0,Viral agents causing lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children: evaluation of the Speed-Oligo® RSV assay for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the viral agent which is more frequently involved in lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants under 1 year of age in developed countries. A new oligochromatographic assay, Speed-Oligo® RSV, was designed and optimized for the specific detection and identification of RSV subtypes A and B. The test was evaluated in 289 clinical samples from 169 hospitalized children using an immunochromatography (IC) test, virus isolation by culture, and an in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Other viruses causing LRTIs were investigated by cell culture or PCR-based tests. Sixty-two patients were infected by RSV (36.7%). In addition, adenovirus, influenza B, parainfluenza 2, and human metapneumovirus were detected in rates ranging from 5 to 8%. A proportion of 10.1% of the patients had mixed infections. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were, respectively, 94.9, 99.4, 98.9, and 97.4% for Speed-Oligo® RSV, 92.9, 96.3, 92.9, and 96.3% for RT-PCR/RSV, and 58.4, 98.1, 93.3, and 82.6% for IC. Our rates of viral detection and co-infection were similar to those of previously reported series. Finally, we find that Speed-Oligo® RSV is a rapid and easy-to-perform technique for the detection of RSV and the identification of subtypes A and B."

The study includes 87 tissue samples of 39 cases for post-mortem histopathological examination of interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, colitis or tubulointerstitial nephritis and/or accompanying chronic sialadenitis. CMV-DNA was found positive in 35 (40.2%) salivary gland, 19 (21.8%) lung, 1 (1.1%) tonsil, and 1 (1.1%) brain tissues. CMV sialadenitis and/or CMV pneumonia associated with other viral and/or bacterial agents were detected in 23 (60%) of 39 infant cases. The demonstration of CMV-DNA would significantly clarify the cause of death and collection of epidemiological data in SUDI cases with clinical history and histopathological findings of CMV infection accompanying chronic CMV sialadenitis. Furthermore, CMV suppresses the immune system, and may predispose to other bacterial and/or viral infections in these cases. Post-mortem molecular investigations are useful in explaining cause of death in SUDI with a suspicion of infection in forensic autopsies."
CD011926,0,19190941,0,Establishing a surveillance network for severe lower respiratory tract infections in Korean infants and young children.,"To reduce morbidity and mortality through integrated case management, a pilot study to detect respiratory viruses in patients with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) was designed as part of a nationwide surveillance for this disease in Korea. The study population consisted of hospitalized patients under the age of 5 years with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. A prospective 6-month study was performed. Two hundred and ninety-seven nasopharyngeal secretions were collected and multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR)/polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed to detect respiratory viruses. If there were any positive RT-PCR/PCR results, viral cultures were proceeded for confirmation. Respiratory viruses were identified in 49.6% of 296 patients. The detection rates were as follows: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected in 52.7% (87/165), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 15.8%, human corona virus (hCoV) in 5.5%, adenovirus in 9.7%, human bocavirus (hBoV) in 5.5%, parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 3.6%, rhinovirus (RV) in 4.2%, and the influenza virus in 3% of the patients with ALRIs. The consistent rate of positive results between RT-PCR and viral culture was 92% (105/114). Using our methods to detect viral causes seemed to be acceptable for the national surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections in infants and children."

CD011926,0,8382271,0,Detection of human cytomegalovirus DNA in paraffin sections of human brain by polymerase chain reaction and the occurrence of false negative results.,"Paraffin-embedded necropsy material from 6 patients with human cytomegalovirus encephalitis (HCMVE) corroborated by immunocytochemistry and 11 control cases were examined for the presence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA by a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). A characteristic 183 base pair (bp) fragment of the HCMV genome could readily be amplified in 4 cases of HCMVE. In 2 cases of HCMVE, viral DNA could be demonstrated only sporadically by PCR, due most likely to inefficient DNA extraction or DNA degradation. All control cases remained negative. The nPCR provides a specific method for detecting HCMV DNA in routinely processed biopsy and necropsy material and may be used in archival tissues for the diagnosis of infection. Fixation of samples and DNA extraction are, however, crucial steps and require careful control if PCR is used for detection of HCMV, to avoid false negative results."
CD011926,0,25713206,0,"Microbial aetiology of acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age in Khartoum, Sudan.","Diarrhoea is one of leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent estimations suggested the number of deaths is close to 2.5 million. This study examined the causative agents of diarrhoea in children under 5 years of age in suburban areas of Khartoum, Sudan. A total of 437 stool samples obtained from children with diarrhoea were examined by culture and PCR for bacteria, by microscopy and PCR for parasites and by immunoassay for detection of rotavirus A. Of the 437 samples analysed, 211 (48%) tested positive for diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli, 96 (22%) for rotavirus A, 36 (8%) for Shigella spp., 17 (4%) for Salmonella spp., 8 (2%) for Campylobacter spp., 47 (11%) for Giardia intestinalis and 22 (5%) for Entamoeba histolytica. All isolates of E. coli (211, 100 %) and Salmonella (17, 100%), and 30 (83%) isolates of Shigella were sensitive to chloramphenicol; 17 (100%) isolates of Salmonella, 200 (94%) isolates of E. coli and (78%) 28 isolates of Shigella spp. were sensitive to gentamicin. In contrast, resistance to ampicillin was demonstrated in 100 (47%) isolates of E. coli and 16 (44%) isolates of Shigella spp. In conclusion, E. coli proved to be the main cause of diarrhoea in young children in this study, followed by rotavirus A and protozoa. Determination of diarrhoea aetiology and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of diarrhoeal pathogens and improved hygiene are important for clinical management and controlled strategic planning to reduce the burden of infection."
CD011926,0,23765783,0,Human rhinoviruses in INDIS-study material-evidence for recovery of viable rhinovirus from fecal specimens.,"The significance of human rhinoviruses (HRV) as prevailing respiratory pathogens has sharpened during the recent years followed by implementation of molecular methods in detection. Rhinoviruses are detected exceedingly in hospitalized cases of respiratory infection with varying severity, in addition to being frequent in cases of common cold. The aim of this study was to evaluate occurrence of HRV in a prospective study material. The prospective INDIS material comprises nasopharyngeal (N=429) and fecal (N=425) specimens from children under 11 years of age collected during any clinical infection. Validated real-time RT-PCR assays were applied for the detection of HRV. HRV were detected numerously not only in the nasopharyngeal specimens, but a myriad also in fecal specimens, 236 (55.0%) and 149 (35.1%), respectively, fecal findings actually beyond anticipation. A total of 13 of HRV-positive fecal specimens were selected for genetic typing in the VP4/VP2 coding region. HRV-A strains were detected in seven specimens: HRV-A9, -A10, -A24, -A49, -A56 and -A82. HRV-B-strains were detected three times: HRV-B42 and -B79, and HRV-C twice: HRV-C12 and HRV-Cpat4. HRV-B42 also showed cytopathic effect in cell culture, confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and VP4/VP2 sequencing, suggesting presence of viable HRV in fecal specimens."
CD011926,0,9765858,0,"Detection of pap, sfa and afa adhesin-encoding operons in uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains: relationship with expression of adhesins and production of toxins.","A total of 243 Escherichia coli strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) were investigated for the presence of pap, sfa and afa adhesin-encoding operons by using the polymerase chain reaction. It was found that 54%, 53% and 2% of the strains exhibited the pap, sfa and afa genotypes, respectively. Pap+ and/or sfa+ strains were more frequent in cases of acute pyelonephritis (94%) than in cases of cystitis (67%) (P < 0.001) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (57%) (P < 0.001). The pap and/or sfa operons were found in 90% of strains expressing mannose-resistant haemagglutination (MRHA) versus 37% of MRHA-negative strains (P < 0.001). The presence of pap and sfa operons was especially significant in strains belonging to MRHA types III (100%) (without P adhesins) and IVa (97%) (expressing the specific Gal-Gal binding typical of P adhesins). Both pap and sfa operons were closely associated with toxigenic E. coli producing alpha-haemolysin (Hly+) and/or the cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1. There was an apparent correlation between the pap and sfa operons and the O serogroups of the strains. Thus, 93% of strains belonging to O1, O2, O4, O6, O7, O14, O15, O18, O22, O75 and O83 possessed pap and/or sfa operons, versus only 32% of strains belonging to other serogroups (P < 0.001). The results obtained in this study confirm the usefulness of our MRHA typing system for presumptive identification of pathogenic E. coli exhibiting different virulence factors. Thus, 85% of strains that possessed both pap and sfa adhesin-encoding operons showed MRHA types III or IVa previously associated with virulence of E. coli strains that cause UTI and bacteraemia."

The results showed that (a) two separate regions of the VZV genome, represented by genes 4 and 40, were detected in neurons in two normal and three AIDS ganglia, (b) evidence of transcription of VZV genes 4, 21, 29, and 63 was found in normal and AIDS cases, and (c) VZV DNA and RNA for the same gene (gene 29) was detected in neurons in serial tissue sections in three cases. Thus more than one region of the VZV genome is present in neurons during VZV ganglionic latency, and the presence of both a VZV gene and its corresponding RNA transcript can be shown to occur in the same localised region of DRG tissue."
CD011926,0,9142125,0,Maternal HIV-1 viral load and vertical transmission of infection: the Ariel Project for the prevention of HIV transmission from mother to infant.,"Most HIV-1 infections of children result from mother-to-infant transmission, which may occur perinatally or postnatally, as a consequence of breast feeding. In this study, the influence of maternal viral load on transmission of infection to infants from non-breast-feeding mothers was examined using samples of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at several time points during pregnancy and the 6-month period after delivery. These samples were analyzed by several quantitative methods, including virus cultures of PBMCs and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for HIV-1 RNA in plasma and DNA in PBMCs. The risk of transmission increased slightly with a higher viral load, but transmission and nontransmission occurred over the entire range of values for each assay. No threshold value of virus load was identified which discriminated between transmitters and nontransmitters. We also noted a significant rise in viral load and a decline in CD4+ lymphocytes in the six months after delivery. These findings suggest that a high maternal viral load is insufficient to fully explain vertical transmission of HIV-1. Additional studies are needed to examine the post-partum increase in viremia."

CD011926,0,8618904,0,Major histocompatibility complex class II DR alleles DRB1*1501 and those encoding HLA-DR13 are preferentially associated with a diminution in maternally transmitted human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection in different ethnic groups: determination by an automated sequence-based typing method.,"Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) from an infected women to her offspring during gestation and delivery was found to be influenced by the infant's major histocompatibility complex class II DRB1 alleles. Forty-six HIV-infected infants and 63 seroreverting infants, born with passively acquired anti-HIV antibodies but not becoming detectably infected, were typed by an automated nucleotide-sequence-based technique that uses low-resolution PCR to select either the simpler Taq or the more demanding T7 sequencing chemistry. One or more DR13 alleles, including DRB1*1301, 1302, and 1303, were found in 31.7% of seroreverting infants and 15.2% of those becoming HIV-infected [OR (odds ratio) = 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.0-6.8); P = 0.048]. This association was influenced by ethnicity, being seen more strongly among the 80 Black and Hispanic children [OR = 4.3 (1.2-16.4); P = 0.023], with the most pronounced effect among Black infants where 7 of 24 seroreverters inherited these alleles with none among 12 HIV-infected infants (Haldane OR = 12.3; P = 0.037). The previously recognized association of DR13 alleles with some situations of long-term nonprogression of HIV suggests that similar mechanisms may regulate both the occurrence of infection and disease progression after infection. Upon examining for residual associations, only only the DR2 allele DRB1*1501 was associated with seroreversion in Caucasoid infants (OR = 24; P = 0.004). Among Caucasoids the DRB1*03011 allele was positively associated with the occurrence of HIV infection (P = 0.03)."
CD011926,0,8014501,0,Transmission of human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type II by transfusion of HTLV-I-screened blood products.,"Blood donors have been screened for antibodies to human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I since December 1988. Screening for HTLV-II has been simultaneously done because of cross-reactivity between antibodies to the two viruses. Currently, < 1 in 10,000 US blood donors is positive for HTLV-I or -II. Lookback studies led to the identification of 6 HTLV-II-infected patients. Three received transfusions before introduction of HTLV-I screening tests, while the other 3 received blood components that tested negative for HTLV-I. The HTLV-II subtypes of each of 4 donor/recipient pairs, as determined by DNA amplification using polymerase chain reaction, were identical, supporting the view that transfusions were the source of infection. In conclusion, currently licensed blood donor screening tests for HTLV-I lack sensitivity for HTLV-II, and transfusion of blood from HTLV-II-infected donors that test negative on HTLV-I screening tests may result in infection."

Laboratory diagnostics of influenza A and B type, RSV, adenovirus and parainfluenzavirus (type 1, 2 and 3) was performed using direct immunofluorescence test (DIFA), virus isolation on MDCK cell line and RT-PCR assay. Respiratory viruses were detected in about half of hospitalised patients and one fifth of ambulatory patients. Within these groups more than 80% hospitalised patients and 70% ambulatory patients were infected with influenza virus. Two influenza A subtypes (H3N2) and (H1N1) and B type were detected. Influenza ranged from 68,8% (26-45 age group) to 89,5% (15-25 age group) of all laboratory confirmed respiratory infections, only among the youngest children (0-3 years old) one fourth of infections was caused by influenza virus and in 50% samples RSV was detected. Influenza virus was also present in over 80% positive samples from hospitalised patients over 65 years old. Sensitivity of RT-PCR compared to other influenza diagnostic methods was 95% and specificity was > or = 99%. Fast and accurate influenza diagnostics using molecular biology methods enables implementing therapy with the new generation antivirals (neuraminidase inhibitors), that are effective only when administered up to 36-48 h from onset of the illness. In diagnostics of other. respiratory viruses it is necessary to apply more sensitive diagnostic methods e.g. multiplex RT-PCR. Influenza isolates were A/Wyoming/3/2003-like, B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like, A/New Caledonia/20/99-like and B/Jiangsu/10/2003-like strains that were components of influenza vaccines for 2003/04 and/or 2004/05 seasons. Annual vaccination remains the best way to prevent infection in high risk populations. Costs of influenza vaccine and oseltamivir prophylaxis in our country are on average respectively fifty and five times lower than each day of patients' stay at an intensiv care unit. Every year within the confines of global surveillance programs (e.g. SENTINEL), there are monitored circulating influenza viruses, in order to define vaccine composition for the next season and identify new and potentially pandemic strains."
CD011926,0,12172744,0,Application of a real-time polymerase chain reaction with internal positive control for detection and quantification of enterovirus in cerebrospinal fluid.,"A quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method based on TaqMan technology was developed to determine the presence and amount of enterovirus RNA. In order to prevent false-negative results, a one-step multiplex RT-PCR was optimized. It contains two dual-labelled fluorogenic probes to quantify the 5' noncoding region of enterovirus and detect an internal positive control. In the present study, 104 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected during an outbreak of enteroviral meningitis were analyzed using this method. Amplification of the internal positive control was effective in all but two specimens, confirming the absence of PCR inhibitors and allowing the results of amplification to be validated. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR was 96.8%, while that of cell culture was 34.9%. Genomic viral loads found ranged between 3.3 and 5.9 log(10) copies per milliliter of cerebrospinal fluid (mean, 4.8 log(10) copies/ml). This fluorogenic enterovirus RT-PCR allows large numbers of samples to be screened rapidly. Moreover, its sensitivity and reproducibility make it highly reliable. With these characteristics, the enterovirus RT-PCR can be a useful tool that may offer considerable benefit in the clinical management of patients with enteroviral infections."

A case patient was defined as a hospitalized person who had test results positive for pH1N1 virus by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Among 255 hospitalized patients, 34% were admitted to an intensive care unit and 8% died. Thirty-four percent of patients were children <18 years of age, 8% were adults ≥ 65 years of age, and 67% had an underlying medical condition. Chest radiographs obtained at hospital admission that had findings that were consistent with pneumonia were noted in 103 (46%) of 255 patients. Among 255 hospitalized patients, 208 (82%) received neuraminidase inhibitors, but only 47% had treatment started ≤ 2 days after illness onset. Overall, characteristics of hospitalized patients with pH1N1 infection in fall 2009 were similar to characteristics of patients hospitalized with pH1N1 infection in spring 2009, which suggests that clinical severity did not change substantially over this period."

The detection rate of HHV-6 DNA was the highest (87%) in children aged 1-year-old and decreased with age, whereas the detection rate of HHV-7 increased with age and reached a maximum in adults. HHV-6B was detected in almost all samples except for two children who secreted only HHV-6A. When the antibody prevalence was determined in the four groups of children, HHV-6 antibody was detected in 8/12 (66.7%), 10/12 (83.3%), 15/16 (93.8%), and 13/14 (92.9%), respectively.

CD011926,0,8486935,0,Early viremia and immune responses in vertical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.,"Thirty-three infants born to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive women were evaluated from birth using plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures, polymerase chain reaction, and serum p24 antigen assays. Five children were identified as infected. Evidence of infection was found in cord blood and subsequent samples from 2 infected children, suggesting in utero infection. Virologic studies on cord blood and early neonatal specimens from the 3 other infected children were negative but became positive by 8 weeks of age, suggesting either intrapartum transmission or sequestration of virus with subsequent detection. An increase in blood (plasma and PBMC) virus titers consistent with primary viremia was observed in 4 infants between 3 and 16 weeks of age. Blood virus titers subsequently declined in the absence of antiretroviral therapy and in the absence of activated HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses or broadly neutralizing antibodies. Confirmation of these results in larger studies may be helpful in the design of clinical trials to interrupt vertical transmission or to modify the course of infection."
CD011926,0,8051621,0,An assessment of the timing of mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by means of polymerase chain reaction.,"To approximate the contributions of in utero, intrapartum, and postnatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and to evaluate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a diagnostic tool for pediatric HIV infection, blood was collected at birth (cord blood), and at 3, 6-12, and 13-24 months in 218 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers in Kigali, Rwanda. Proviral DNA was detected by a double PCR using two sets of three primers (gag, pol, and env). Pediatric HIV-1 infection was defined according to serological and clinical criteria. The probability of having a positive PCR at a given time was calculated by a nonparametric method. Among children with unequivocal evidence of infection (n = 47), it was 30.5% on cord blood and 80.6% at 3 months. Thus, in children born to HIV-1-infected mothers, the estimated rate of transmission in the late postnatal period is 4.9%, and the rate of transmission in the intrapartum plus postnatal periods is 17.6%. Among 117 HIV-1-uninfected children born to HIV-1-infected mothers, six (5%) had a false-positive PCR on cord blood. These results should be taken into account in designing intervention trials aimed at reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1."
CD011926,0,11712092,0,Cytomegalovirus infection of extremely low-birth weight infants via breast milk.,"In addition to seroprevalence and transmission rate, the clinical symptoms of postnatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in infants with a very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g; <32 weeks gestational age at birth) were assessed in a 3-year prospective study. CMV monitoring included serologic testing (of the mother and child) and virus culture and PCR (of samples of both breast milk and the infant's urine). Within 3 weeks of the initial virus detection in the infant, clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Of 170 infants, no CMV transmission was found in the 80 infants of seronegative mothers and in the 3 infants of seropositive mothers who did not shed CMV DNA into breast milk. Transmission occurred in 33 of the 87 CMV-exposed infants, 16 of whom presented with such symptoms as hepatopathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and sepsis-like deterioration. Low birth weight and early postnatal virus transmission were risk factors for symptomatic infection. VLBW infants of CMV-seropositive mothers are at high risk of acquiring a symptomatic CMV infection postnatally via breast milk."
CD011926,0,9049817,0,Outbreak of septicaemia in neonates caused by Acinetobacter junii investigated by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and four typing methods.,"Septicaemia caused by Acinetobacter occurred in six infants in the neonatal unit. A total of 18 acinetobacters were isolated from blood cultures, cultures of intravascular catheters, and surveillance cultures. Twelve isolates from the six affected infants were identified as Acinetobacter junii by the use of a novel method, amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Typing of the organisms using the biochemical profiles of the API 20NE system, antibiogram typing, cell envelope protein electrophoresis, and PCR fingerprinting with two primer sets, ERIC1/ERIC2 and ERIC2/ 1026, showed that these 12 isolates were indistinguishable, whereas the remaining six isolates were different. The six infants recovered after therapy with ciprofloxacin alone in five cases and with a combination of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin in one case. This study showed that A. junii is capable of causing a serious, though non-fatal infection in neonates. The combined use of genotypic and phenotypic methods allowed the rapid separation of epidemic from non-epidemic isolates. It is concluded that for a better understanding of the role of the various Acinetobacter genomic species in human pathology, identification of acinetobacters according to the recent taxonomy is imperative."
CD011926,0,23844261,0,Characterization of the upper respiratory tract microbiomes of patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza.,"The upper respiratory tract microbiome has an important role in respiratory health. Influenza A is a common viral infection that challenges that health, and a well-recognized sequela is bacterial pneumonia. Given this connection, we sought to characterize the upper respiratory tract microbiota of individuals suffering from the pandemic H1N1 influenza A outbreak of 2009 and determine if microbiome profiles could be correlated with patient characteristics. We determined the microbial profiles of 65 samples from H1N1 patients by cpn60 universal target amplification and sequencing. Profiles were examined at the phylum and nearest neighbor ""species"" levels using the characteristics of patient gender, age, originating health authority, sample type and designation (STAT/non-STAT). At the phylum level, Actinobacteria-, Firmicutes- and Proteobacteria-dominated microbiomes were observed, with none of the patient characteristics showing significant profile composition differences. At the nearest neighbor ""species"" level, the upper respiratory tract microbiomes were composed of 13-20 ""species"" and showed a trend towards increasing diversity with patient age. Interestingly, at an individual level, most patients had one to three organisms dominant in their microbiota. A limited number of discrete microbiome profiles were observed, shared among influenza patients regardless of patient status variables. To assess the validity of analyses derived from sequence read abundance, several bacterial species were quantified by quantitative PCR and compared to the abundance of cpn60 sequence read counts obtained in the study. A strong positive correlation between read abundance and absolute bacterial quantification was observed. This study represents the first examination of the upper respiratory tract microbiome using a target other than the 16S rRNA gene and to our knowledge, the first thorough examination of this microbiome during a viral infection."

All 9 infants received antifungal agents. Fluconazole was administered in 7 patients and successfully eradicated this organism in 6 with no adverse effects. For epidemiological investigation, 64 environmental specimens and hand-washings of all 54 staff members involved in the NICU were examined for the presence of this organism. No C. albicans could be identified from environmental sources, while the hand-washing of 1 nurse was C. albicans-positive. Two genotyping methods, including electrophoretic karyotyping using contour-clamped homogeneous electric field gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction-based direct sequencing of rRNA gene, were used in the analysis of the isolates recovered from blood cultures of the infants, the hand-washing of the nurse and 7 control isolates. Both methods yielded comparable results and revealed that all 13 isolates from infected infants as well as the isolate from hand washing of the nurse were of the same genotype while the control isolates were distinct. These results suggest that the outbreak of C. albicans fungaemia was caused by a particular strain and possibly via cross-infection. In addition, we showed that fluconazole seemed to be safe and effective in treating C. albicans fungaemia in neonates, although the data were limited."

Serial sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded autopsy tissues were tested by PCR and compared to histology and HSV antigen detection. The sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of this PCR protocol were determined on uninfected and HSV-infected mouse tissues and on HSV DNA from infected tissue culture cells. Samples estimated to contain as few as 60 copies of preserved HSV DNA target sequence gave a positive PCR result. In nine neonates that died during acute HSV infection, all non-neural tissues and a minority of neural tissues with histological lesions had HSV antigen; when DNA could be amplified, HSV DNA sequences were detected by PCR. Together, these findings indicate a direct role for virus in the pathogenesis of these lesions. In the same cases, some or all brain samples were negative for HSV antigen, but nevertheless had HSV DNA sequences detected by PCR. The possible explanations for this finding are discussed. In one neonate dying seven weeks after birth, HSV sequences were found in brain lesions in the absence of HSV antigen; neither HSV DNA nor antigen were found in non-neural tissues, suggesting a latent HSV infection in brain. It is practical to apply PCR methods to detect minute quantities of viral DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded autopsy tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

For women with serological evidence of primary T. gondii infection, amniocentesis and antiparasitic treatment were offered. The amniotic fluid was examined for T. gondii by PCR and mouse inoculation to detect fetal infection. Infants of infected mothers had clinical and serological follow-up for at least 1 year to detect congenital infection. Of the women 10.9% were infected before the onset of pregnancy. Forty-seven women (0.17% among previously noninfected women) showed evidence of primary infection during pregnancy. The highest incidence was detected (i) among foreign women (0.60%), (ii) in the capital city of Oslo (0.46%), and (iii) in the first trimester (0.29%). Congenital infection was detected in 11 infants, giving a transmission rate of 23% overall, 13% in the first trimester, 29% in the second, and 50% in the third. During the 1-year follow-up period only one infant, born to an untreated mother, was found to be clinically affected (unilateral chorioretinitis and loss of vision). At the beginning of pregnancy 0.6% of the previously uninfected women were falsely identified as positive by the Platelia Toxo-IgM test, the percentage increasing to 1.3% at the end of pregnancy. Of the women infected prior to pregnancy 6.8% had persisting specific immunoglobulin M (IgM). A positive specific-IgM result had a low predictive value for identifying primary T. gondii infection."
CD011926,0,7496917,0,Flow cytometric immunodetection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 proviral DNA by heminested PCR and digoxigenin-labeled probes.,"PCR is the most sensitive and direct method for detecting blood-borne viruses, as well as an efficient means for producing vector-free probes. However, the application of PCR, especially in the laboratory diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, is impeded by the current use of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. Therefore, we have developed a nonisotopic PCR immunoreactive bead (PCR-IRB) assay to detect HIV type 1 proviral DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We used a biotinylated primer in a set of three oligonucleotides selected from the HIV long terminal repeat region for heminested PCR amplification. An internal probe was synthesized by PCR with incorporation of digoxigenin-labeled dUTP. After solution hybridization of the probe with PCR-amplified products (amplicons), the hybridized DNA was captured with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. For the detection of hybrids, flow cytometric analyses were carried out by two procedures: (i) direct detection with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled antidigoxigenin immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody and (ii) indirect detection with antidigoxigenin sheep IgG antibody followed by FITC-labeled anti-sheep IgG antibody. Both procedures in the PCR-IRB assay detected two to three copies of HIV proviral DNA sequences, a sensitivity that is comparable with that of the conventional radioactive detection of amplicons following probe hybridization and electrophoresis. To compare the PCR-IRB assay with the conventional method, we tested 53 pedigreed PBMC specimens from blood donors and newborns; the results obtained were identical. This nonisotopic PCR-IRB assay can also be automated for potential application in laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection, blood bank screening, and therapeutic monitoring of viremia and perinatal transmission."
CD011926,0,9104802,0,Early HIV-1 envelope-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in vertically infected infants.,"High frequencies of cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) recognizing HIV-1 laboratory strain gene products have been detected in adults within weeks of primary infection. In contrast, HIV-1-specific CTLp are uncommonly detected in infants younger than 6 mo. To address the hypothesis that the use of target cells expressing laboratory strain env gene products might limit the detection of HIV-1 env-specific CTLp in early infancy, recombinant vaccinia vectors (vv) expressing HIV-1 env genes from early isolates of four vertically infected infants were generated. The frequencies of CTLp recognizing target cells infected with vv-expressing env gene products from early isolates and HIV-1 IIIB were serially measured using limiting dilution followed by in vitro stimulation with mAb to CD3. In one infant, the detection of early isolate env-specific CTLp preceded the detection of IIIB-specific CTLp. CTLp recognizing HIV-1 IIIB and infant isolate env were detected by 6 mo of age in two infants. In a fourth infant, HIV-1 IIIB env and early isolate env-specific CTLp were simultaneously detected at 12 mo of age. These results provide evidence that young infants can generate HIV-1-specific CTL responses and provide support for the concept of neonatal vaccination to prevent HIV-1 transmission. However, the early predominance of type-specific CTL detected in some young infants suggests that the use of vaccines based on laboratory strains of HIV-1 may not protect against vertical infection."

We detected HPeVs in 110 samples by either cell culture, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), or both. Serotyping either by neutralization test or by nucleotide sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 region and 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) regions revealed that 63 were HPeV type 1 (HPeV-1), followed by 44 HPeV-3 strains, 2 HPeV-4 strains, and 1 HPeV-6 strain. The high nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the Japanese HPeV-3 isolates in 2006 to the strains previously reported from Canada and Netherlands confirmed the worldwide prevalence of HPeV-3 infection. Ninety-seven percent of the HPeV-positive patients were younger than 3 years, and 86.2% younger than 12 months. The clinical diagnoses of HPeV-positive patients were gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, febrile illness, exanthema, ""hand, foot, and mouth disease,"" aseptic meningitis, and herpangina. Among 49 HPeV-positive patients with gastroenteritis, 35 were positive with HPeV-1 and 12 with HPeV-3, and out of 25 with respiratory illness, 11 were positive with HPeV-1 and 14 with HPeV-3. HPeV-3 seemed to be an important etiological agent of respiratory infection of children. While HPeV-1 was detected predominantly during fall and winter, the majority of the HPeV-3 cases were detected during summer and fall. A different pattern of clinical manifestations as well as seasonality suggested that there are different mechanisms of pathogenesis between HPeV-1 and HPeV-3 infections."

We have previously described the cloning and molecular characterization of a determinant, ibeA (also called ibe10), from the chromosome of an invasive cerebrospinal fluid isolate of E. coli K1 strain RS218 (O18:K1:H7). Here we report the identification of another chromosomal locus, ibeB, which allows RS218 to invade brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC). The noninvasive TnphoA mutant 7A-33 exhibited <1% the invasive ability of the parent strain in vitro in BMEC and was significantly less invasive in the central nervous system in the newborn rat model of hematogenous E. coli meningitis than the parent strain. The TnphoA insert with flanking sequences was cloned and sequenced. A 1,383-nucleotide open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 50-kDa protein was identified and termed ibeB. This ORF was found to be 97% identical to a gene encoding a 50-kDa hypothetical protein (p77211) and located in the 13-min region of the E. coli K-12 genome. However, no homology was observed between ibeB and other known invasion genes when DNA and protein databases in GenBank were searched. Like the TnphoA insertion mutant 7A-33, an isogenic ibeB deletion mutant (IB7D5) was unable to invade BMEC. A 7. 0-kb locus containing ibeB was isolated from a LambdaGEM-12 genomic library of E. coli RS218 and subcloned into a pBluescript KS vector (pKS7-7B). pKS7-7B was capable of completely restoring the BMEC invasion of the noninvasive TnphoA mutant 7A-33 and the ibeB deletion mutant IB7D5 to the level of the parent strain. More importantly, the ibeB deletion mutant IB7D5 was fully complemented by pFN476 carrying the ibeB ORF (pFN7C), indicating that ibeB is required for E. coli K1 invasion of BMEC. Taken together, these findings indicate that several E. coli determinants, including ibeA and ibeB, contribute to crossing of the blood-brain barrier."
CD011926,0,2536766,0,Human newborn natural killer cell responses to activation by monoclonal antibodies. Effect of culture with herpes simplex virus.,"Deficient responses by NK cells may contribute to the susceptibility of human newborns to severe HSV infections. Furthermore, HSV disseminates widely during neonatal infection and may also infect and interfere with the function of blood mononuclear cells (MNC). To determine whether the function of newborn NK cells would be affected by contact with HSV, and whether newborn NK cells might be permissive for HSV replication, newborn MNC were cultured with HSV in vitro for 3 days. Before culture, the intracellular calcium mobilization in newborn NK cells induced by mAb to CD2 and CD16 did not differ from that of adult NK cells. This result argues against immaturity of an early NK cell activation event in human newborns. After culture with HSV the Ca2+ flux response was unaffected by lysis of K562 targets by newborn NK cells and NK-dependent suppression of HSV replication in fibroblasts were preserved or increased. Incorporation of thymidine by NKH-1 cells following stimulation with PHA and IL-2 was not suppressed. NK cells recovered from these cultures did not contain infectious HSV and synthesis of HSV-specific proteins was not detected by immunoprecipitation although HSV genome was detected by DNA hybridization. Our results extend the in vitro model stimulation systems in which newborn NK cells respond positively to include triggering through the CD2 Ag, cross-linking of cell surface CD 16 Ag and response to a pathogen, HSV."

The performance of the current rotavirus vaccines against unusual or rare circulating rotavirus serotypes cannot be predicted and continuous monitoring of wild type rotaviruses will remain a priority. Routine molecular rotavirus surveillance conducted in the Gauteng Province, South Africa during 2004, resulted in the detection of strains that could not typed using standard G specific genotyping primers. Sequencing of the first round amplicons revealed 19 serotype G12P[6] strains and one G12P[8] strain. Phylogenetic analyses of the G12 strains indicated that these strains are probably a recent introduction into South Africa and emerged from a strain related to the Indian isolate ISO-5. The association of the South African G12s with the P[6] genotype may suggest a mechanism for unusual strains to become more ecologically suited to local population transmission dynamics. This is the first report of serotype G12 strains on the African continent and continued surveillance will be required to track the emergence of G12 strains in Africa."
CD011926,0,19144476,0,Does Ureaplasma spp. cause chronic lung disease of prematurity: ask the audience?,"Ureaplasma has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of both preterm labour and neonatal morbidity, particularly chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD), but despite numerous studies, reviews and meta-analyses, its exact role remains unclear. Many papers call for a definitive randomised control trial to determine if eradication of pulmonary Ureaplasma decreases the rates of CLD but few address in detail the obstacles to an adequately powered clinical trial. We review the evidence for Ureaplasma as a causative agent in CLD, asking why a randomised control trial has not been performed. We surveyed the opinions of senior neonatologists in the UK on whether they felt that there was sufficient evidence for Ureaplasma either causing or not causing CLD and whether a definitive trial was needed, as well as their views on the design of such a trial. Additionally, we ascertained current practice with respect to Ureaplasma detection in preterm neonates in the UK. There is clear support for an adequately powered randomised controlled clinical trial by senior neonatologists in the UK. There are no reasons why a definitive trial cannot be conducted especially as the appropriate samples, and methods to culture or identify the organism by PCR are already available."

Cohorting of affected infants has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy in reducing nosocomial transmission of RSV, and may keep cubicles free for other patients who require them. Testing of symptomatic children for RSV is standard practice, but unfortunately traditional laboratory testing is not rapid enough to aid decision-making processes. Rapid point-of-care testing (POCT) in the emergency department has been suggested as an alternative. We performed a prospective study to quantify the amount of cubicle time saved by using POCT results to allow a targeted cohorting strategy. Over the four-month study period, the POCT allowed 183 children to be admitted directly to a designated cohort area, thus saving 568.5 cubicle-days for other patients. This is equivalent to five cubicles being left free for each day of the study period. This is the first time the benefits of using POCT have been quantified in this way. POCT for RSV is a safe, cost-effective and efficient way to improve bed management."
CD011926,0,11901812,0,Molecular methods for rapid detection of group B streptococci.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) are an important cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Implementation of selective intrapartum chemoprophylaxis based on either a screening-based approach or a risk-based approach has led to a substantial decrease in the morbidity and mortality of GBS disease. Current 'gold-standard' detection methods for GBS are selective broth cultures of combined vaginal and anal specimens collected at 35-37 week's gestation. Rapid immunological detection methods, including latex agglutination test, enzyme immunoassay and optical immunoassay, as well as hybridization-based test, are available. These methods are useful in rapid identification of heavily colonized women, but are unable to detect light GBS colonization due to poor sensitivity. Recent development of real-time PCR and fluorescence labeling technologies has provided new detection platforms for bacterial identification. GBS-specific PCR assays using these new technologies offer promising tools for sensitive and specific detection of GBS directly from clinical specimens. The application of these assays in the current prevention strategy will simplify the prevention practice and rationalize antibiotic use."
CD011926,0,19107966,0,LTR real-time PCR for HIV-1 DNA quantitation in blood cells for early diagnosis in infants born to seropositive mothers treated in HAART area (ANRS CO 01).,"HIV-1 diagnosis in babies born to seropositive mothers is one of the challenges of HIV epidemics in children. A simple, rapid protocol was developed for quantifying HIV-1 DNA in whole blood samples and was used in the ANRS French pediatric cohort in conditions of prevention of mother-to-child transmission. A quantitative HIV-1 DNA protocol (LTR real-time PCR) requiring small blood volumes was developed. First, analytical reproducibility was evaluated on 172 samples. Results obtained on blood cell pellets and Ficoll-Hypaque separated mononuclear cells were compared in 48 adult HIV-1 samples. Second, the protocol was applied to HIV-1 diagnosis in infants in parallel with plasma HIV-RNA quantitation. This prospective study was performed in children born between May 2005 and April 2007 included in the ANRS cohort. The assay showed good reproducibility. The 95% detection cut-off value was 6 copies/PCR, that is, 40 copies/10(6) leukocytes. HIV-DNA levels in whole blood were highly correlated with those obtained after Ficoll-Hypaque separation (r = 0.900, P < 0.0001). A total of 3,002 specimens from 1,135 infants were tested. The specificity of HIV-DNA and HIV-RNA assays was 100%. HIV-1 infection was diagnosed in nine infants before age 60 days. HIV-DNA levels were low, underlining the need for sensitive assays when highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been given. The performances of this HIV-DNA assay showed that it is adapted to early diagnosis in children. The results were equivalent to those of HIV-RNA assay. HIV-DNA may be used even in masked primary infection in newborns whose mothers have received HAART."

The most common schistosome was Schistosoma haematobium, with an overall prevalence of 51.3%; S. mansoni had a prevalence of 12%. No S. intercalatum egg was seen in the stools. Biomphalaria pfeifferi and Bulinus truncatus were found in pools at the base of the Dogon cliffs; Bulinus forskalii was found in smaller numbers in brick pits. Two isolates from urine samples of children were identified as S. haematobium in the laboratory using an alpha-glycerophosphate marker, restriction enzyme analysis of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA. The isolates did not develop in Bulinus forskalii or B. crystallinus of the B. forskalii group. Some evidence for past hybridization of S. haematobium and S. intercalatum is provided by the enzyme and rDNA results as well as the positive Ziehl-Neelsen staining of polymorphic eggs in urine samples. The findings are discussed in relation to the published observations concerning schistosomiasis in travellers returning from this region of Mali."

CD011926,0,18360899,0,Detection of a broad range of human adenoviruses in respiratory tract samples using a sensitive multiplex real-time PCR assay.,"Human adenoviruses (hAdVs) are associated with acute respiratory tract infections in pediatric populations and have been identified as a cause of outbreaks in institutional settings. Rapid diagnosis of hAdV infection is critical for appropriate and timely management. This study reports the design and validation of a sensitive and specific multiplex real-time PCR for the detection of a broad range of hAdV serotypes in respiratory samples. The assay targets the conserved region of the hAdV hexon gene and utilizes hydrolysis probes for the detection of amplified products. The assay was evaluated using retrospectively (n = 864) and prospectively (n = 11,451) collected samples from November 2005 to July 2006. Seasonality studies and analysis of outbreaks was conducted over a 2-year period from January 2005 to December 2006 (n = 33,067 samples). The assay gave a hAdV positive rate of 7.1% (n = 811) for specimens tested prospectively and was able to detect a broad range of hAdV serotypes with good sensitivity and specificity. A high rate of co-infection was noted (21.7%). Adenovirus infections were more prevalent in the young with a median age of 24 months for positive patients. Sequence analysis of hAdV positives showed that serotype 7 was the most prevalent followed by serotypes 2 and 3. Association of hAdVs with respiratory outbreaks was low at 2.3% (6 of 266 outbreaks tested) and no seasonal variation was observed for hAdV infections during the 2-year study period. This assay can improve the detection of hAdVs in respiratory samples and can be used to provide valuable epidemiological information."
CD011926,0,10797378,0,"Evaluation of enterovirus serological tests IgM-EIA and complement fixation in patients with meningitis, confirmed by detection of enteroviral RNA by RT-PCR in cerebrospinal fluid.","An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detection of anti-enterovirus IgM antibodies was compared with complement fixation test in 43 patients with confirmed enterovirus meningitis by RT-PCR of cerebrospinal fluids (CSF). In 34% of patients with enterovirus meningitis, IgM antibodies could be found, whereas complement fixation tests were positive in only 20%. The specificity was determined with sera of 105 patients with non-enterovirus meningitis. Specificity of IgM EIA and of complement fixation was 94% and 85%, respectively. In four patients with meningitis but without enterovirus detection in CSF, RT-PCR and virus isolation from stools were positive. In three of these patients, IgM antibodies were detected, giving a strong indication of an enterovirus-associated disease. Because of the high specificity of IgM EIA, diagnosis of enterovirus-associated diseases can be carried out in a single serum sample, whereas by complement fixation tests, only fourfold increases in antibody titres in paired sera indicate an acute infection. The application of IgM EIA is especially important in cases of meningitis when CSF samples are not available and for diagnosis of enterovirus diseases with other clinical symptoms such as fever, enteritis, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease."
CD011926,0,8808312,0,Development of a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction assay for detection of Mycoplasma hominis.,A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay was developed for the detection of Mycoplasma hominis.

The PCR assay can amplify as few as 18 molecules of target DNA. This diagnostic assay offers potential for wide clinical application as it is rapid and can be successfully performed on crude sample preparations from a variety of media or biopsies. The use of this assay should aid in defining the aetiologic and pathologic roles played by M. hominis and thereby benefit patients.
CD011926,0,16492989,0,Inflammatory mediators for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis in early infancy.,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and procalcitonin (PCT) are important parameters in the diagnosis of sepsis and for differentiating between viral and bacterial infection in children. We compared the value of IL-6, IL-8, and PCT with C-reactive protein (CRP) in the diagnosis and treatment of late-onset sepsis among infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (group I) and febrile infants admitted to general hospitals from home (group II). Group I was divided into subgroups Ia, positive blood culture (all Gram-positive cocci); Ib, negative blood culture; and Ic, controls. Group II was divided into subgroups IIa, systemic enterovirus infection, and IIb, no enterovirus infection. Enterovirus was identified by real-time (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or by culture in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The positive predictive values of IL-6, IL-8, and PCT (78%, 72%, and 83%, respectively) were better than that of CRP (63%) in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. After 48 h of antibiotic treatment, IL-6 and IL-8 levels significantly decreased and PCT stabilized in clinically recovered patients, suggesting that these markers may be useful in distinguishing patients in which antibiotic treatment may be discontinued. Among infants of subgroup IIa, 80%-90% had normal values of IL-6, IL-8, and PCT, whereas CRP was increased in 40%. In conclusion, IL-6, IL-8, and PCT are better parameters than CRP in the diagnosis and follow-up of neonatal sepsis due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and in the exclusion of bacterial infection among those with enteroviral infection among febrile infants presenting from home."
CD011926,0,23002071,0,Maternal oral origin of Fusobacterium nucleatum in adverse pregnancy outcomes as determined using the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic transcribed spacer region.,"Fusobacterium nucleatum, a common Gram-negative anaerobe prevalent in the oral cavity, possesses the ability to colonize the amniotic cavity and the fetus. However, F. nucleatum may also be part of the vaginal microbiota from where it could reach the amniotic tissues. Due to the heterogeneity of F. nucleatum, consisting of five subspecies, analysis at the subspecies/strain level is desirable to determine its precise origin. The aims of this study were: (i) to evaluate the use of the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region as a tool to differentiate subspecies of F. nucleatum, and (ii) to design a simplified technique based on the ITS to determine the origin of F. nucleatum strains associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Amplified fragments of the 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS region corresponding to the five subspecies of F. nucleatum were subjected to cloning and sequencing to characterize the different ribosomal operons of the subspecies. Distinctive length and sequence patterns with potential to be used for identification of the subspecies/strain were identified. These were used to evaluate the origin of F. nucleatum identified in neonatal gastric aspirates (swallowed amniotic fluid) by sequence comparisons with the respective oral and vaginal maternal samples. A simplified technique using a strain-specific primer in a more sensitive nested PCR was subsequently developed to analyse ten paired neonatal-maternal samples. Analysing the variable fragment of the ITS region allowed the identification of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum from an oral origin as potentially being involved in neonatal infections. Using a strain-specific primer, the F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain was detected in both neonatal gastric aspirates and maternal oral samples in cases of preterm birth from mothers presenting with localized periodontal pockets. Interestingly, the same strain was not present in the vaginal sample of any case investigated. The 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS can be a useful tool to determine the origin of F. nucleatum. The results of this study strongly indicate that F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum of oral origin could be involved with pregnancy complications."

This study describes the clinical and genetic epidemiology of RSV infection among Tunisian neonates. Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from 268 newborns with LRI were screened for RSV by immunofluorescence assay. Positive samples were analysed by RT-PCR-hybridisation assay for subgroup classification of RSV genomes. RSV infection was present in 23.1% of neonates, with a predominance in males. Peak incidence occurred in winter. Subgroup classification showed a higher prevalence of group B than group A strains. Nosocomially acquired RSV infection was present in 37% of neonates, 54.3% had an underlying condition predisposing to severe disease and 13% died. The average duration of hospital stay was 10 days and 87% of newborns required supplemental oxygen. As no currently effective treatment is available, preventive measures are a priority in high-risk infants."

CD011926,0,25666389,0,Neonatal Candidemia Caused by Candida haemulonii: Case Report and Review of Literature.,"Candidemia is a frequent condition in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) and usually complicates the newborns clinical course. Several factors are responsible for candidiasis, such as prematurity and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and in these cases, there are the involvement of various Candida species, as C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis. However, other species as C. haemulonii has been rarely described in candidemia cases, being considered an emergent pathogen. Thus, we report a case of neonatal candidemia by C. haemulonii and a review of literature of fungemia by this yeast. The patient was a neonate with gestational age of 26 weeks and birth weight of 660 g hospitalized in a NICU from a Brazilian hospital. The identification of the etiological agent was performed by phenotypic methods, scanning electron microscopy, sequencing of the ITS region of rDNA, and mass spectrometry. Antifungal susceptibility testing was carried out according to the Clinical Laboratories and Standards Institute guidelines. The newborn was diagnosed with candidemia by C. haemulonii resistant to amphotericin B with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8 µg/mL, sensitive to fluconazole (MIC: 8 µg/mL) and voriconazole (MIC: 0.12 µg/mL). The treatment with fluconazole (12 mg/kg/day) was established with good outcome. Candidemia by C. haemulonii is still being limited to a few sporadic cases in adults with endemic and restricted occurrences in neonates. Usually, the therapy with amphotericin B is ineffective against this species. Our results showed the importance of the mycological diagnosis associated to antifungigrama for the successful clinical management followed by important epidemiological data."

We report on a sudden clustering of antigen-positive enzyme immuno assays results in a level III neonatal intensive care unit, involving 22 of 43 infants screened. Although antigen-positive samples were significantly associated with bloody stools (P<0.001) and gastric residues (P<0.02), norovirus infection could not be confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or electron microscopy.

Based on thorough knowledge in histophysiologic and dynamic aspects of lymphoid organs, the histopathologic evaluation in cases of suspected immunodeficiency today forms an integral part of the assessment of the immune status. Apart from conventional histologic techniques, advanced technology such as immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization is applied. This enables analysis of the basic cellular components in various lymphoid tissue compartments, and evaluation of the consequences of the deficiency by the assessment of microorganisms and neoplasia. This review focuses on the histopathologic contribution to immunodeficiency evaluation. Sections deal with (1) the description of alterations in the various lymphoid tissues (bone marrow, thymus, lymph node, spleen, and gastrointestinal tissue); (2) histopathology of infection and malignancy; (3) pathology of some types of congenital immunodeficiency; (4) histopathologic methods and reagents; and (5) an autopsy protocol for immunodeficiency."

CD011926,0,1561488,0,Parvovirus infection of the human fetus and newborn.,"Human parvovirus B19 is a recently recognized cause of hydrops fetalis. It is a small, single-stranded DNA virus, which preferentially infects late erythroid precursors and produces red blood cell (RBC) aplasia, fetal anemia, and cardiac failure. Infection is accompanied by characteristic intranuclear inclusions in fixed and circulating RBC precursors. These inclusions have been shown to contain virus particles by electron microscopy and in situ hybridization. Infection of the fetus, mother, and newborn infant can be diagnosed by serological and molecular methods selected to match the stage of the infection. Recent work has shown that parvovirus B19 can infect cells other than erythroid precursors, and that additional mechanisms such as myocarditis may contribute to hydrops fetalis in some cases. Infected fetuses are not always hydropic. Maternal infection results in increased abortion and stillbirth even in the absence of transplacental transmission, which occurs in approximately one third of infected mothers. The overall risk of fetal loss following maternal exposure is much less than previously thought, and may be less than 3% in the first 20 weeks of gestation or approximately 10% if the mother is actually infected. Although parvoviruses are teratogenic in animals, there is no evidence that B19 is a significant teratogen in man. The long-term outlook of survivors of intrauterine infection, including those successfully treated by intrauterine blood transfusion, appears to be good, but requires further study."

This paper describes the clinical and laboratory features of EV meningitis in children with no CSF pleocytosis. Clinical, laboratory, and virological data of Dutch patients <16 years diagnosed with EV meningitis, between 2003 and 2008, were analyzed retrospectively. Data of children with and without CSF pleocytosis were compared. A total of 149 children were infected with EV. Patients presented mainly with fever (n = 113), malaise (n = 43), abdominal pain (n = 47), and irritability (n = 61). Of the 60 patients with EV meningitis, 23 had no pleocytosis.

Therefore, pregnant women are a risk group, for which it is necessary to determine the serologic profile. The objective of this study is to determine the serologic profile of toxoplasmosis in pregnant women followed at the Parasitology Laboratory of the Pasteur Institute in Tunis, to establish the prevalence of toxoplasmic infections during pregnancy and the incidence of the CT, noting the difficulties faced in the interpretation of serological results. This is a retrospective study concerning 2833 toxoplasmic serologies practiced on 2070 pregnant women, followed at the Parasitology-Mycology Laboratory of the Pasteur Institute of Tunis, between 2007 and 2010. Serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was done by ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) for the detection of Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and M and the study of toxoplasmosis IgG avidity. Prenatal diagnosis was performed for 58 women by amniotic fluid sampling. Toxoplasma gondii was detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). At birth, the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis was established based on serology. The toxoplasmic serologies carried out have shown that 45.6% of the pregnant women were formerly immunized while 49.6% had a negative serology. A toxoplasmosis primary infection acquired during pregnancy was detected in 79 cases (3.8%). Among them, 33% had a true seroconversion while 67% had a recent toxoplasmosis infection in view of the positivity of IgG and IgM on the first sample with a low index of avidity (IA).

CD011926,0,15753012,0,High-risk mucosal human papillomavirus infections during infancy & childhood.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small DNA tumour viruses associated with a variety of proliferative diseases. More than 100 types have been identified and can broadly be grouped into cutaneous and mucosal types according to their site of infection, and can be further subdivided into low-risk (LR) and high-risk (HR) types depending upon their association with malignancy. The main route of transmission of HR mucosal HPVs is through sexual contact, although the acquisition of virus cannot be entirely explained by this mode alone. Evidence also exists for horizontal transmission by other routes and vertical transmission. HR HPVs, particularly HPV-16, have been detected in oral swabs from newborns, infants and children. Such alternative modes of transmission and acquisition may have an important impact in several areas, including vaccination strategies, epidemiological studies, and the clinical management of children with HPV-associated diseases. This article reviews the literature describing the detection of HPV infections during infancy and childhood and provides evidence for a role of vertical transmission in the spread of HPV infection."

Ten infection-free premature infants of similar post-conceptional age were used as controls. Serial determinations of plasma creatinine concentration (PCr), as well as the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), potassium, magnesium (FEMg), phosphate (FEP) and uric acid (FEUA), and the urinary excretion of calcium (UCa/UCr ratio) were assessed before, during and after treatment. During the treatment period a significant increase in FENa, FEMg and UCa/UCr was observed in group B (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and an increase in FENa and UCa/UCr in group C (P < 0.01) compared with controls. These disturbances were observed with trough concentrations of aminoglycosides but were accentuated at peak serum concentrations and were restored to normal 2 days after stopping therapy. In addition, a significant correlation was demonstrated between FENa, FEMg and UCa/UCr ratio in treated patients. PCr levels decreased similarly in all patient groups, but in 8 of 30 infants (27%) they remained elevated and returned to control values only 10 days after stopping therapy.

Stool samples from 15 mothers in each group and environmental swabs collected from the bed and surfaces around neonates were tested for rotavirus using single round and nested PCR for the VP6 gene. Rotavirus could be detected in environmental swabs using single round PCR for VP6 gene in 40% of neonates positive for rotavirus antigen by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and 33.3% of EIA negative neonates. The detection rate was almost 100% using the nested VP6 PCR. Rotavirus was detected in maternal samples only if the nested VP6 PCR was used, with no significant difference between rates of rotavirus detection in maternal fecal samples of infected and uninfected neonates (p-0.4). Sequence analysis of nested VP6 amplicons from two environmental swabs revealed them to be closest in identity to G10P[11], the most common genotype causing infections in neonates in this setting. Interestingly, sequences of amplicons from maternal stool samples did not cluster with G10P[11] or other VP6 subgroup I strains but showed clustering with human strains of VP6 subgroup II."
CD011926,0,19040613,0,Persistent low thymic activity and non-cardiac mortality in children with chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletion and partial DiGeorge syndrome.,"A subgroup of patients with 22q11.2 microdeletion and partial DiGeorge syndrome (pDGS) appears to be susceptible to non-cardiac mortality (NCM) despite sufficient overall CD4(+) T cells. To detect these patients, 20 newborns with 22q11.2 microdeletion and congenital heart disease were followed prospectively for 6 years. Besides detailed clinical assessment, longitudinal monitoring of naive CD4(+) and cytotoxic CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells (CTL) was performed. To monitor thymic activity, we analysed naive platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31(+)) expressing CD45RA(+)RO(-)CD4(+) cells containing high numbers of T cell receptor excision circle (T(REC))-bearing lymphocytes and compared them with normal values of healthy children (n = 75). Comparing two age periods, low overall CD4(+) and naive CD4(+) T cell numbers were observed in 65%/75%, respectively, of patients in period A (< 1 year) declining to 22%/50%, respectively, of patients in period B (> 1/< 7 years). The percentage of patients with low CTLs (< P10) remained robust until school age (period A: 60%; period B: 50%). Low numbers of CTLs were associated with abnormally low naive CD45RA(+)RO(-)CD4(+) T cells. A high-risk (HR) group (n = 11) and a standard-risk (SR) (n = 9) group were identified. HR patients were characterized by low numbers of both naive CD4(+) and CTLs and were prone to lethal infectious and lymphoproliferative complications (NCM: four of 11; cardiac mortality: one of 11) while SR patients were not (NCM: none of nine; cardiac mortality: two of nine). Naive CD31(+)CD45RA(+)RO(-)CD4(+), naive CD45RA(+)RO(-)CD4(+) T cells as well as T(RECs)/10(6) mononuclear cells were abnormally low in HR and normal in SR patients. Longitudinal monitoring of naive CD4(+) and cytotoxic T cells may help to discriminate pDGS patients at increased risk for NCM."

CD011926,0,23826567,0,Rapid determination of chimerism status using dihydrorhodamine assay in a patient with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetic disease, which is caused by defects in the NADPH oxidase complex (gp91(phox), p22(phox), p40(phox), p47(phox), and p67(phox)) of phagocytes. This defect results in impaired production of superoxide anions and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are necessary for killing bacterial and fungal microorganisms and leads to recurrent, life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and granulomatous inflammation. The dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry assay is a useful diagnostic tool for CGD that can detect absent or reduced NADPH oxidase activity in stimulated phagocytes. We report a patient with X-linked CGD carrying a novel mutation of the CYBB gene whose chimerism status following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been rapidly determined using the DHR assay. The level of DHR activity correlates well with short tandem repeat PCR analysis. Considering the advantages of this simple, rapid, and cost-effective procedure, serial measurement of DHR assay would facilitate the rapid determination of a patient's engraftment status, as a supplementary monitoring tool of chimerism status following HSCT."

CD011926,0,17642533,0,A preliminary study of dengue infection in Brunei.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of dengue infection in Brunei and to determine the predominant serotype circulating in the country. The study generated useful epidemiological data on dengue infection in Brunei. A total of 271 samples from patients suspected of having dengue infections were selected and analyzed. All patients were seen in clinics and hospitals in Brunei. The samples were collected from April 2005 to April 2006 and transported to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research, University of Malaya, Malaysia. The following tests were used to achieve the objectives: in-house IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, virus isolation in mosquito albopictus cell line (C6/36), and viral RNA detection and serotyping by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results show that 45 people were positive for dengue-specific IgM (27 males and 18 females), while RT-PCR detected dengue viral RNA in 12 patients, 3 identified as DEN-1 and 9 as DEN-2. Dengue virus was isolated from 6 patients using the C6/36 cell line; 3 were DEN-2 isolates and 3 were DEN-1 isolates. These data show that dengue virus is circulating in Brunei and the predominant infecting serotype for that period was DEN-2 followed by DEN-1. This study is the first to report the detection and isolation of dengue virus from Brunei using RT-PCR and culture in the C6/36 albopictus mosquito cell line."
CD011926,0,1329403,0,[New methods for diagnosing infection in pregnancy].,"Maternal infections during pregnancy are of special relevance because of the risk of transmission to the fetus. Besides serological methods of diagnosing acute maternal infection, new approaches to assess fetal involvement have been made by invasive procedures, such as ultrasound-guided fetal blood sampling or amniocentesis. The most relevant infections in pregnancy are briefly reviewed with their incidence, consequences of fetal infection, and standard diagnostic procedures. Immunological methods are handicapped by the immaturity of the fetal immune system; direct culture is complicated and time-consuming. The application of molecular biological methods to directly identify the RNA- or DNA-sequences of the infectious agent may be an alternative. Two methods, polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) and in-situ hybridization (ISH) are explained. Broad clinical use is still hindered by problems in specificity and quantitative accuracy. Nevertheless, successful diagnosis of most of the relevant infections in pregnancy by these molecular biological methods, is published, and discussed in a review of the recent literature."
CD011926,0,18073181,0,Cytomegalovirus infection: the state of the art.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading cause of congenital infection in humans and constitutes a major public health problem. Congenitally infected infants, both symptomatic and asymptomatic at birth, may develop sequelae, particularly sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and brain damage. Transmission of the virus from mother to fetus can occur during either primary or recurrent maternal infection; however it is much higher in primary infected mothers than in mothers with preconceptional immunity. Routine CMV screening for primary infection during pregnancy constitutes a controversial issue, because of the lack of prenatal recommended therapy for congenital CMV infection. Ganciclovir may be used to treat neonates with symptoms at birth. Despite advances in antiviral therapy, congenitally infected infants, both symptomatic and asymptomatic at birth, need a follow up evaluation to detect sequelae. Congenital CMV infection cna be diagnosed at birth by using a test based on detection of viral DNA by PCR in dried blood spots (Guthrie card) collected on filter paper in the first days of life. Therefore, universal newborn screening for CMV by using DBS test should be recommended to detect sequelae as early as possible, so that infants can receive intervention promptly."
CD011926,0,15064032,0,Rubella.,"Maternal rubella is now rare in many developed countries that have rubella vaccination programmes. However, in many developing countries congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) remains a major cause of developmental anomalies, particularly blindness and deafness. WHO have provided recommendations for prevention of CRS, and, encouragingly, the number of countries introducing rubella vaccination programmes has risen. However, declining uptake rates due to concerns about the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in the UK, and increasing numbers of cases in some European countries coupled with poor uptake rates might jeopardise this progress. Surveillance of postnatally and congenitally acquired infection is an essential component of CRS prevention since rubella is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds alone. Laboratory differentiation of rubella from other rash-causing infections, such as measles, parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus 6, and enteroviruses in developed countries, and various endemic arboviruses is essential. Reverse transcriptase PCR and sequencing for diagnosis and molecular epidemiological investigation and detection of rubella-specific IgG and IgM salivary antibody responses in oral fluid are now available."

The virus has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of many children with aseptic meningoencephalitis. Intrauterine transmission has been documented by HHV 6 DNA detection in cord blood specimens of apparently healthy newborns and in fetuses following spontaneous abortions. A patient is described with early neonatal afebrile seizures resulting from a congenital HHV 6 variant B infection disclosed by repeated detection of viral genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cerebrospinal fluid in the first days of life. At follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies disclosed hyperintensities in the periventricular white matter and basal ganglia, associated with cerebral atrophy. Further follow-up at 18 months revealed poor neurological outcome with mild neurodevelopmental retardation, strabismus and hypertonia of legs. This report provides evidence of neurological involvement after HHV 6 vertical transmission, and the association with neurological sequelae."
CD011926,0,23046990,0,The validation and utility of a quantitative one-step multiplex RT real-time PCR targeting rotavirus A and norovirus.,"Rotavirus (RoV) and Norovirus (NoV) are the main causes of viral gastroenteritis. Currently, there is no validated multiplex real-time PCR that can detect and quantify RoV and NoV simultaneously. The aim of the study was to develop, validate, and internally control a multiplex one-step RT real-time PCR to detect and quantify RoV and NoV in stool samples. PCR sensitivity was assessed by comparing amplification against the current gold standard, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), on stool samples from 94 individuals with diarrhea and 94 individuals without diarrhea. PCR detected 10% more RoV positive samples than EIA in stools samples from patients with diarrhea. PCR detected 23% more NoV genogroup II positive samples from individuals with diarrhea and 9% more from individuals without diarrhea than EIA, respectively. Genotyping of the PCR positive/EIA negative samples suggested the higher rate of PCR positivity, in comparison to EIA, was due to increased sensitivity, rather than nonspecific hybridization. Quantitation demonstrated that the viral loads of RoV and NoV in the stools of diarrheal patients were an order of magnitude greater than in individuals without diarrhea. This internally controlled real-time PCR method is robust, exhibits a high degree of reproducibility, and may have a greater utility and sensitivity than commercial EIA kits."

A quantitative real-time RT-PCR using specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes was developed to identify RSV and to distinguish RSV subgroups A and B (RSV LNA assay). RSV subgroup diversity and the relationship between viral load and disease severity in confirmed RSV infections were also explored. 264 archived respiratory specimens from pediatric patients were tested in parallel using the commercial multiplex Seeplex™ RV detection kit (Seegene) and the novel RSV LNA assay. The LNA assay demonstrated a significantly higher sensitivity than Seeplex, improving overall detection rates from 24% (64/264) to 32% (84/264). Detection limits of 9.0×10(1) and 6.0×10(2)copies/mL were observed for RSV A and B, respectively. RSV A was detected in 53/84 (63%) cases, and 31/84 (37%) were positive for RSV B. This novel method offers a rapid, quantitative, highly specific and sensitive approach to laboratory diagnosis of RSV."

CD011926,0,23616461,0,Toxoplasma seroconversion with negative or transient immunoglobulin M in pregnant women: myth or reality? A French multicenter retrospective study.,"Classically, Toxoplasma infection is associated with high levels of specific IgM antibody and a rise in specific IgG levels 1 to 3 weeks later. Atypical IgG seroconversion, without IgM detection or with transient IgM levels, has been described during serologic follow-up of seronegative pregnant women and raises difficulties in interpreting the results. To evaluate the frequency and the characteristics of these atypical cases of seroconversion, an investigation was conducted within the French National Reference Center for Toxoplasmosis, from which 26 cases collected from 12 laboratories belonging to the network were identified. The aim of this work was to retrospectively analyze the results of serologic testing, the treatments administered, and the results of prenatal and postnatal follow-up for these women. In each case, IgG antibodies were detected using both screening and confirmatory tests. IgM antibodies were not detected in 15 cases, and the levels were equivocal or low-positive in 11 cases. The IgG avidity results were low in 16 cases and high in one case. Most of the pregnant women (22/26) were treated with spiramycin from the time that IgG antibodies appeared until delivery. Amniotic fluid was analyzed for Toxoplasma gondii DNA by PCR in 11/26 cases, and the results were negative in all cases. Congenital toxoplasmosis was ruled out in 12/26 newborns. There was no abnormality observed at birth for 10 newborns and no information available for 4 newborns. In conclusion, when the interpretation of serological results is so difficult, it seems cautious to initiate treatment by spiramycin and to follow the pregnant women and their newborns."
CD011926,0,15741392,0,Herpes simplex virus encephalitis during suppressive therapy with acyclovir in a premature infant.,"Cutaneous herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection was recognized at 19 days of age in a 1415-g female infant born at 31 weeks of gestation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative, and MRI of the brain was normal. After a 14-day course of high-dose intravenous acyclovir, the infant developed a cutaneous recurrence at 38 days of age. CSF HSV PCR again was negative. She was subsequently begun on oral acyclovir to prevent cutaneous reactivation of HSV. At 3 months of age, the infant developed HSV encephalitis as manifested by fever, seizures, abnormal CSF indices, abnormal brain MRI, and positive CSF HSV PCR. No cutaneous disease was present. It is not known whether the HSV encephalitis in our patient represented reactivation of previously unrecognized central nervous system infection or new onset of central nervous system disease as a result of spread from other tissue or site to the brain. The failure of oral acyclovir to prevent such an occurrence, however, highlights gaps in our understanding of the pathogenesis of neonatal HSV disease and questions the use of acyclovir suppression to prevent neurologic sequelae."
CD011926,0,10558956,0,Malaria and pregnancy: placental cytokine expression and its relationship to intrauterine growth retardation.,"Malaria infections during pregnancy can lead to the delivery of low-birth-weight infants. In this study, cytokine mRNA was measured in placentas from 23 malaria-infected and 21 uninfected primigravid women who had delivered in Mangochi, Malawi, a region with a high rate of transmission of falciparum malaria. Significantly increased expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and decreased expression of IL-6 and transforming growth factor-beta1 were found in malaria-infected compared with uninfected placentas. TNF-alpha and IL-8 were produced by maternally derived hemozoin-laden placental macrophages. Increased TNF-alpha expression was associated with increased placental hemozoin concentrations. Increased TNF-alpha or IL-8 expression in the placenta was associated with intrauterine growth retardation but not with preterm delivery. The results suggest that malaria infections induce a potentially harmful proinflammatory response in the placenta."
CD011926,0,12794724,0,"Coxsackievirus B3 sequences in the blood of a neonate with congenital myocarditis, plus serological evidence of maternal infection.","A fatal case of myocarditis in a neonate is described. The clinical features were evident at birth, and enteroviral RNA was detected in the blood of the baby on the day of birth and again 10 days later by a generic enterovirus nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The enterovirus RNA was subsequently retested by a separate, newly developed nested RT-PCR assay yielding a PCR product within the VP1 coding region suitable for sequencing. Identical 239-base pair sequences were obtained from the RNA of the two blood samples and this sequence most closely resembled coxsackievirus B3 (94% identity). The baby's mother was pyrexial immediately postpartum and an early antenatal serum and a serum sample collected 10 days postpartum tested in parallel for enterovirus IgM antibody showed negative to strong-positive seroconversion. Infection of the mother was the likely primary event with in utero transfer of the virus to the fetus in the last few days of pregnancy. Neonatal blood is a valuable specimen for enterovirus diagnosis by RT-PCR. A newly developed nested RT-PCR assay was successful in typing the enterovirus from stored RNA extracted directly from the blood samples. Serology for enterovirus IgM antibody can be useful for convalescent diagnosis of enterovirus infection in the mother, especially with earlier serum for comparison."

Currently, the prevalence of MRSA carriers among children is increasing in Japan. There are some reports of nosocomial infection caused by MRSA in a pediatric ward or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). During 6 months (from January 2001 to June 2001), 37 MRSA strains were isolated from 37 neonates who were admitted in the NICU and 52 MRSA were strains isolated from NICU environments. We performed DNA typing of MRSA using an arbitrary primed-PCR method on these isolates. Thirty-seven clinical isolates were classified into four types (A type, 14; B type, 4; C type, 4; D type, 3; and others, 12). The A-type strains of MRSA continued to be isolated for more than 6 months. In the NICU environment, the detection rate of the A-type MRSA was 23.1% (12/52). The A-type strains were frequently isolated from environments around patients. The A-type strains of MRSA were prevalent in the NICU, probably due to nosocomial infection. Although none of the neonatal patients developed severe MRSA infection, the same genotype strains were persistently isolated during a period of more than 6 months from patients and the NICU environment around patients. Environmental control around neonatal patients is important to prevent nosocomial infection in the NICU."
CD011926,0,23340225,0,Characterization of human rotaviruses circulating in Iraq in 2008: atypical G8 and high prevalence of P[6] strains.,"Fecal samples from 976 children with gastroenteritis were collected and analyzed for group A rotavirus (RVA), in three different cities in Iraq between January 2008 and December 2008. RVA antigen was detected in 394 (40%) of the samples, and 98 samples were available for further genotype analyses using multiplex RT-PCR and sequence analyses for untypeable strains. The G/P-genotype combination was determined for 69 samples, and 19, 2 and 8 samples remained P-untypeable, G-untypeable and G/P-untypeable (UT), respectively. The most prevalent genotype was G2 (40%, 39/98) most often associated with P[6]. G1 was the second most common genotype (16%, 16/98) mainly associated with P[8] and P[UT]. G3, G4 and G9 were detected at a lower prevalence (3%, 11%, 3%, respectively), mainly associated with P[6]. Surprisingly, five G8P[6], and seven G12 RVA strains in combination with P[6] and P[8] were also detected for the first time in Iraq. Overall, a striking high prevalence of 47% of the analyzed samples possessed the P[6] genotype (65% of the P-typed RVA strains). Atypical genotype combinations such as G1P[4], G1P[6], G2P[8] or strains with mixed G-types were detected sporadically. The detection of unusual G8P[6] RVA strains prompted us to further analyze the NSP2, NSP3, NSP4 and NSP5 gene segments of three selected G8P[6] strains, resulting in their designation to the N2, T2, E2 and H2 genotypes, respectively. The VP7, VP4, NSP2, NSP3 and NSP5 gene segments clustered closely with common human RVA strains, whereas the NSP4 gene sequences were found to cluster with animal derived RVA strains, suggesting a potential reassortment event. The high prevalence of RVA strains with the G8, G12 and P[6] genotypes in combination with a DS-1-like genotype constellation in Iraq, needs to be monitored closely as these RVA strains might challenge the effectiveness of current RVA vaccines."

The overall prevalence of infection measured by LST was not significantly higher in 2002 (43.2%) than in 1998 (28.3%), but it was with IFAT [16.3%vs. 4.6%; odds ratio (OR): 4.01; 95% CI: 1.03-22.78; P=0.022] which would indicate an increasing transmission. The dipstick test only detected infection in children up to 10 years (19.4%). Prevalence in dogs was not significantly different in 2002 (57%) vs. 1998 (33%). The parasite was isolated from dogs and identified by a polymerase chain reaction based on telomeric sequences as Leishmania chagasi/infantum."
CD011926,0,18335238,0,Outbreaks of human coronavirus in a pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit.,"Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV) has been recently recognized as a potential agent of nosocomial viral respiratory infections (NRVI) in high-risk infants. We have confirmed this as fact through the study of a 1-year period of HCoV outbreaks occurring during a prospective survey of NRVI in a paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit (PNICU) using new molecular techniques for HCoV detection. Nasal samples obtained at admission and weekly thereafter for all hospitalised children, as well as monthly nasal samples from staff, were analysed using immunofluorescence for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B, paramyxoviruses 1, 2, 3 and adenoviruses. RT-PCR was used for HCoV detection. During the year 1998, 43 HCoV-related NRVI were detected in 152 neonates (incidence 28.3%), and 7 HCoV-related NRVI were found in 92 children (incidence 7.6%). Three HCoV-related outbreaks were observed (February, August and December), associated with a high prevalence of HCoV infection in the staff. During the August outbreak, 50% to 78% of hospitalised neonates and children were infected. Seventy-five percent of hospitalised preterm neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks and 52.4% of staff members were infected. Risk factors for NRVI in neonates were birth weight, gestational age, ventilation, oxygenation and hospitalisation length. Ninety-two percent of infected preterm neonates were symptomatic, mainly with bradycardia and respiratory worsening. These data provide additional evidence for a possibly significant role of HCoV in NRVI in a PNICU. The role of staff or hospitalised children in spreading HCoV is hypothesised."

At the 3rd day of life, the viral DNA positive rate in the urine was 7% (4/60), at the 7th day 7% (3/46), at the 14th day 10% (2/20), at the 21st day 10% (1/10), and at the 28th day 25% (1/5). CMV was also detected in samples co-cultivated with HeLa 229 cells and this positive rate was 5% (3/60). The viral positive rate in newborns did not correlate with the gestational age, body weight, or serum IgM level. Six congenital infection cases were identified; two of which were small-for-date babies (SFD) and three of which were born with premature rupture of membranes (PROM). They had no complications during the six months after birth."
CD011926,0,10879244,0,An evaluation of the usefulness of a culture system for the detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum in the endotracheal aspirates of neonates.,"In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of a culture system used in our laboratory for the detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum in the endotracheal aspirates of neonates. Ureaplasmal broth was used to enhance the growth of U. urealyticum followed by observation of colonies on A7 agar. Of the 68 samples of endotracheal aspirates tested, 60 gave positive indication of urease activity by the broth. However, only 14 yielded U. urealyticum colonies on A7 agar medium. Polymerase chain reaction detected U. urealyticum in 21 samples. The use of Ureaplasmal broth was therefore not specific for the diagnosis of U. urealyticum. We suggest that subculture onto agar medium or PCR is essential for definite identification of U. urealyticum."

This study aimed to verify Giardia occurrence and the genotypes of isolates infecting children aged 0-6 years and workers at a daycare centre in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The families of children who tested positive for Giardia, were asked to provide stool samples from household members and their dogs. Samples (123 children, 14 centre employees, 44 household members, 19 children after treatment, and 20 dogs) were examined for intestinal parasites using concentration methods. DNA extracted from all samples was submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and the amplicons generated were used for multilocus sequence typing of beta-giardin (bg), triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) genes. Giardia was detected in 15·9% and 28·6% of the 220 samples by microscopy and PCR, respectively. Analysis of sequences retrieved from 29 isolates revealed both assemblages A (31%) and B (69%). Sub-assemblages AII, BIII and BIV were identified and the alignment of the bg, gdh and tpi sequences revealed the presence of some single nucleotide polymorphisms, especially in assemblage B sequences. The higher predominance of assemblage B and the identification of the AII type support the view that anthroponotic transmission appears to be an important route of transmission in environments that concentrate children at an age when poor hygiene practices make them more vulnerable to such infection."
CD011926,0,8389318,0,The relationship of Epstein-Barr virus to infection-related (sporadic) and familial hemophagocytic syndrome and secondary (lymphoma-related) hemophagocytosis: an in situ hybridization study.,"Many cases of hemophagocytic syndrome have been associated with viral infections, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but the pathogenesis of the syndrome remains unclear. We have examined lymph node, spleen, liver, and bone marrow sections from 12 cases, including four cases of proven or probable infection-related hemophagocytic syndrome (IHPS), three cases of familial hemophagocytic syndrome (FHPS), and five cases of secondary hemophagocytosis associated with T-cell malignant lymphoma (SHPC), for EBV RNA using a sensitive and specific in situ hybridization technique. Epstein-Barr virus RNA was detected in seven of 12 cases (58%), including three cases of IHPS, one case of FHPS, and three cases of SHPC. Numerous EBV-positive cells were detected in two cases of IHPS (in multiple anatomic sites) and in one case of FHPS (in the spleen). Diffuse EBV positivity also was noted within the neoplastic cells of one case of SHPC. Rare to occasional EBV-positive cells were found in multiple sites in another case of IHPS and within admixed, reactive lymphoid cells in two cases of SHPC. The results indicate that numerous EBV-positive cells can be identified in some cases of IHPS, FHPS, and SHPC, suggesting a pathogenetic role for the virus. However, the absence of EBV from a proportion of cases of IHPS and FHPS in this study suggests that other infectious agents also play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome."

CD011926,0,10686028,0,A new enzyme immunoassay for the detection of enteroviruses in faecal specimens.,"A new enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for direct detection of enteroviruses based on a group-specific monoclonal antibody was evaluated using stool samples from patients with suspected enteroviral infection. The EIA was compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus isolation in cell culture. Of 204 samples tested, 20 were positive by EIA, 34 by PCR, and 18 by cell culture. Compared with PCR, the most sensitive method, the sensitivity of EIA was 58% (20/34); the sensitivity of cell culture isolation was 52% (18/34). The results of both assays correlated in only 60% of cases. The combination of EIA and cell culture isolation detected 76% of PCR-positive stool samples. Enterovirus EIA provides results within 3-4 hr and requires only standard EIA equipment. It represents a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective diagnostic tool for enterovirus diagnosis from faecal samples. Negative results must be confirmed by other techniques, such as PCR or virus isolation in cell culture."

CD011926,0,10731807,0,[Human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7)].,"Human herpesviruses 6 (HHV-6) and 7 (HHV-7) are world wide T lymphotropic viruses recently discovered. Their transmission is essentially by salivary route. Primary infections which occurred early in infancy, respectively during the first year of life for HHV-6 and in the second or third year for HHV-7, are followed by latency for life. HHV-7 is not actually associated with a disease. HHV-6 primary infection is often asymptomatic, if not it can induce exanthem subitum. HHV-6 reactivation can be symptomatic in immunodeficient subjects. The role of HHV-6 in the arising of lymphoproliferative or auto-immune diseases, discussed for a long time, is still to elucidate. HHV-6 infection is diagnosed by serodiagnosis in case of primary infection, but in the great number of cases, it would be realized by polymerases chain reaction."
CD011926,0,14759241,0,Integrons as tools for epidemiological studies.,"The integron content of Gram-negative strains implicated in three distinct episodes of suspected cross-infection among inpatients was investigated and compared with ribotyping. In the first episode, ribotyping identified a strain of Acinetobacter, isolated over a 3-month period, responsible for an outbreak associated with the use of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). The second episode concerned simultaneous isolations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens from 13 bronchoscopy patients. In these two episodes, results obtained by analysis of integron content and ribotyping were in agreement and correctly identified the epidemiologically related strains. In the third episode, isolates of Enterobacter cloacae were collected from patients in the neonatal ICU over a 3-month period. Although several isolates belonged to the same ribotype, cross-infection could not always be confirmed when the integron content was analysed. Integron detection can be considered a useful tool for studying molecular epidemiology in hospital environments, facilitating the quick detection of possible cross-infection cases, especially in critical wards such as the ICU."

We have updated an enterovirus assay and combined it with a previously published assay for human parechovirus resulting in a multiplex one-step RT-PCR assay. The multiplex assay was validated by analysing the sensitivity and specificity of the assay compared to the respective monoplex assays, and a good concordance was found. Furthermore, the enterovirus assay was able to detect 42 reference strains from all 4 species, and an additional 9 genotypes during panel testing and routine usage. During 15 months of routine use, from October 2008 to December 2009, we received and analysed 2187 samples (stool samples, cerebrospinal fluids, blood samples, respiratory samples and autopsy samples) were tested, from 1546 patients and detected enteroviruses and parechoviruses in 171 (8%) and 66 (3%) of the samples, respectively. 180 of the positive samples could be genotyped by PCR and sequencing and the most common genotypes found were human parechovirus type 3, echovirus 9, enterovirus 71, Coxsackievirus A16, and echovirus 25. During 2009 in Denmark, both enterovirus and human parechovirus type 3 had a similar seasonal pattern with a peak during the summer and autumn. Human parechovirus type 3 was almost invariably found in children less than 4 months of age. In conclusion, a multiplex assay was developed allowing simultaneous detection of 2 viruses, which can cause similar clinical symptoms."

CD011926,0,17172370,0,Amniotic fluid is not useful for diagnosis of congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection.,"Although Trypanosoma cruzi can be transmitted transplacentally and induce congenital infection, no data are available about the presence of this parasite in human amniotic fluid. We examined 8, 19, and 4 amniotic fluid samples (collected at delivery or by aspiration of gastric content of neonates) from control uninfected mothers (M-B-), infected mothers delivering uninfected newborns (M+B-), and mothers of confirmed congenital cases (M+B+), respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using nuclear and kinetoplastic DNA primers (Tcz1-Tcz2 and 121-122), were negative for all control M-B- samples, but positive for 5 of 19 M+B- and 2 of 4 M+B+ samples. To determine the number of parasites in the positive samples, real-time PCR using S35/S36 kinetoplastic DNA was performed. Only one M+B+ sample presented a high parasitic DNA amount, whereas the other six PCR-positive samples displayed traces of T. cruzi DNA. In conclusion, the release of parasites in amniotic fluid is probably a rare event that cannot be helpful for the routine diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease."

Of these 85 infants, 27 had blood exchange transfusions (BET) and 28 had bolus blood transfusions two to nine times. Fifteen of 27 infants underwent BET with blood that had been filtered through Pall RC100 leukocyte removal filter; the other 12 with unfiltered blood. Neither urinary CMV DNA nor serum CMV-specific IgM was detected at birth in any of the 85 pre-term infants; during the first 6 months after birth urinary CMV DNA, for both MIE and LA, appeared in 22 of the 85 infants (25.9%) and CMV IgM was positive in 14 of the 85 (16.5%). Nine of the 12 (75%) infants who received BET of unfiltered blood showed a significantly higher prevalence of urinary CMV DNA compared to the infants in the other three groups (i.e., those who received no blood transfusion, those who had bolus blood transfusions, or those who received BET of filtered blood; P < 0.01 in each instance). In a logistic regression model, CMV DNA urinary excretion was significantly associated with the mode of blood transfusion (unfiltered BET), and the Odds ratio was 38.9 (95% confidence interval, 9.4-160). There was no significant association with other independent variables such as gender, mother's seropositivity, gestational age, birth-weight or delivery mode.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011926,0,23124002,0,Detection and typing of cutaneous human papillomavirus types--a comparison of three different methods.,"Cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV) may play a role in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. HPV copy numbers in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are very low and hence sensitive and reliable detection methods are important, particularly to examine the natural history of cutaneous HPV. In the present study, the presence of cutaneous HPV types was examined in 194 skin swabs and in a subgroup of 91 skin swabs, and compared using three different PCR based methods: (i) beta/gamma cutaneous HPV PCR reverse-line-blotting (BGC-PCR RLB), (ii) multiplex cutaneous papillomavirus genotyping (McPG) and (iii) FAP PCR. The HPV prevalence was 75% (68/91) with BGC-PCR RLB, 64% (124/194) with McPG and 72% (139/194) with FAP PCR. The agreement for the detection of HPV between the three methods in the subset of 91 samples was 73% (66/91; kappa=0.34) for BGC-PCR RLB and McPG, 75% (68/91; kappa=0.32) for BGC-PCR RLB and FAP PCR, and 69% (63/91; kappa=0.25) for McPG and FAP PCR. For McPG and FAP PCR, 194 specimens were tested in total, with an overall agreement of 66% (129/194; kappa=0.24) for the detection of HPV. The concordance between the three methods was moderate, which could be explained by different HPV types detectable with each method; the high number of multiple infections and the low viral copy number in human skin. Overall, many cutaneous HPV types were identified and multiple HPV types were found frequently in the human skin swabs."

Isolates were characterized by conventional and molecular serotyping and analyzed for scpB, lmb, hylB, cylE, bac, bca and rib gene content. Antimicrobial susceptibility to penicillins, macrolides, lincosamides, quinolones and tetracyclines was determined using disk diffusion and the MICs for penicillin were determined by E-test. Molecular serotyping for all eight serotypes (Ia, Ib, II-VII) was in full accordance with conventional serotyping. Overall, taking CS and MS together, serotype VI was the most common capsular type (22.3 %) followed by VII (21.4 %), III (20.4 %), Ia (17.5 %), V (9.7 %), II (7.7 %) and IV (1 %). Susceptibility to beta-lactam antimicrobials was prevalent (100 %). Resistance rates for erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline were 23.3 %, 17.5 % and 71.8 %, respectively. PCR-virulence gene screening showed the presence of cylE, lmb, scpB and hylB in almost all the isolates while rib, bca, and bac genes were found in 29.1 %, 14.6 % and 9.7 % of the isolates. Certain genes were significantly associated with specific serotypes, namely, rib with serotypes Ia, II, III and VI; bca and bac with serotypes II and III. Furthermore, serotype Ia was significantly more common among patients with invasive infections (p < 0.01) and serotype VI isolates were significantly more common among carriers (p < 0.05). In summary, serotype distribution correlates with virulence gene content will be useful in epidemiological studies and design of vaccines."
CD011926,0,26471105,0,Copy number variants in association with type 1 collagenopathy: Atypical osteogenesis imperfecta.,"We report a sibling-pair and a 4-year old child from two families with an atypical presentation in Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). In the sib-pair, the older sibling initially came to medical attention due to a fracture history (Patient 1) and she was shown to have a COL1A2 mutation. In addition, she also had developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, and a history of frequent infections which led to a search for an alternate diagnosis. ArrayCGH revealed a 4.3 Mb duplication on chromosome 19q13.42q13.43, which was confirmed by FISH analysis. On further familial analysis, the younger sibling who had no previous fracture history was also found to have the COL1A2 mutation and tested positive for the 19q13.42q13.43 duplication (Patient 2). The 19q13 duplication appears to be the cause of intellectual disability in these siblings but given that this is a chromosomal duplication, it is still possible that there is an as yet unidentified cause that may account for the combined phenotype in this family. Patient 3 was a 4-year old child presenting with a femoral fracture, blue sclerae, developmental delay, and joint hypermobility. Genetic analyses confirmed a COL1A2 mutation but also revealed an 8.8 Mb deletion of 11q24.2q25, confirmed by G-band chromosome analysis.

In this longitudinal study, specimens were collected from 114 newborns in the Neonatal Unit at Pretoria Academic Hospital on a daily basis between January and May 1997. The babies remained in the ward between 1 week and 4 months. The stool specimens or rectal swabs were analysed for the presence of rotavirus antigen using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dako Rotavirus EIA) or electron microscopy. In total, 80 (70 per cent) of the neonates excreted rotavirus during their stay in the unit. There was a direct correlation between the length of stay in the ward and the shedding of rotavirus. The babies excreted rotavirus on average between 2 and 7 days. Rotavirus infection tended to occur within the first 2 weeks of life and was only observed once in most babies. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the RNA revealed the presence of two strains of rotavirus, with the differences in the RNA electropherotype occurring in the RNA segment triplet 7, 8 and 9. The VP7 serotype of the virus is encoded by one of these genes, and so the VP7 serotype of the virus was determined by monoclonal antibody and RT-PCR using VP7 serotype specific primers. The VP4 genotype of the viruses was also determined using RT-PCR of the VP4 gene to determine if a new rotavirus had been introduced to the ward. The strains were all characterized as G4P[6], which is similar to the antigenic make-up of the virus recovered 10 years before. This highlights the remarkable stability of rotavirus strains in neonatal units over long periods of time."
CD011926,0,22946228,0,[The development of diagnostics of herpes viral infections].,"The representatives of herpesviruses family (Herpesviridae--virus of herpes simplex and human cytomegalovirus) are largely widespread in human population. These herpesviruses bring on severe disorders of embryonic development up to fetal death, newborn diseases, neurologic disturbances, deafness, and blindness and in transplantation patients the severe internal organs affections and transplanted organs rejection. Both herpesviruses are able to affect the central nervous system and result in encephalitis with lethal outcome. The particular attention deserve the asymptomatic forms in case of which virus is excretee and can be transmitted both by horizontal line (sexual way included) and by vertical line (in the process of itrauterine development offtetus). The lacking of clear djfefrentiating clinical symtoms frequentyv observed under manifestations of herpesviruses infections brings another danger The comparison is made of fouur methods of detection of herpes simplex in urethra scrapes: the immunocytochemical method of detection of herpes simplex antigen in smears: the rapid cultural method; the immune-enzyme method of detection of herpes simplex antigen; the polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that the rapid cultural method detected herpes simplex in infected samples on all stages of disease and in even more quantity at the stage of exacerbtion as compared with the polymerase chain reaction. The presented data testify the actuality of development of of laboratory diagnostics of herpesviruses injection to relevant diagnosis, determination of form and stage of disease, timely initiation of treatment and monitoring of therapy."
CD011926,0,25818195,0,Diagnostic sensitivity of a rapid antigen test for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae: Comparison with real-time PCR.,"A rapid antigen kit for the detection of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae ribosomal protein L7/L12 using an immunochromatographic assay, Ribotest Mycoplasma, became available in Japan in 2013. To determine the sensitivity of Ribotest compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we prospectively performed these two tests simultaneously in adolescent and adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In addition, we retrospectively analyzed the theoretical sensitivity of Ribotest using M. pneumoniae PCR-positive specimens from previous studies. In prospective study, 118 CAP cases were enrolled, and 16 cases were diagnosed as M. pneumoniae pneumonia; eight cases were PCR-positive, one case was culture positive, and all cases demonstrated a four-fold increase in antibody titer. Ribotest was positive in 15 cases; five cases were PCR positive and 10 cases were PCR negative. For the PCR was control test, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall agreement with Ribotest were 62.5%, 90.9%, and 88.9%, respectively. In the retrospective study, we used 1110 M. pneumoniae PCR-positive specimens, which are collected from pediatric patients with respiratory tract infection who visited 65 institutions throughout Japan. Using a cut-off level for the Ribotest of 8.3 × 10(4) copy/mL in transport medium, 667 (60.0%) specimens were theoretically positive. In conclusion, our prospective and retrospective results demonstrated that the diagnostic sensitivity of Ribotest compared with PCR was not high, at approximately 60%. Thus, treatment decisions about M. pneumoniae pneumonia should be based on clinical findings such as Japanese Respiratory Society scoring system and not on Ribotest results alone."
CD011926,0,7901357,0,Replication and tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 as predictors of disease outcome in infants with vertically acquired infection.,"In a series of 97 infants born to mothers who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 18 were identified as infected within the first 60 days of life on the basis of viral culture and polymerase chain reaction findings. We studied viral burden in vivo by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the in vitro replication pattern of the HIV-1 infecting strain by culturing patient cells with normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. According to the lag phase before p24 antigen detection and the level of p24 production on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 isolates from these patients were classified as rapid/high (R/H), slow/high (S/H), and slow/low (S/L). The pattern of HIV-1 replication in vitro was significantly associated with the viral burden in vivo; the range of HIV-1 copies per 10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 10 to 38, 44 to 314, and 360 to 947 in children with isolates of the S/L, S/H, and R/H types, respectively. Viral tropism was assessed by culturing patient cells under end-point dilution conditions with either CD4+ T-lymphocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that children with S/L isolates harbored mainly monocytotropic variants; all infants with S/H or R/H isolates had T-lymphotropic variants and, in 7 of 11 cases, monocytotropic or amphitropic variants. All children with R/H isolates had HIV-related symptoms by the age of 4 months, and five had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by the age of 1 year. At 1 year of age, four and no infants with S/H or S/L isolates, respectively, had HIV-1-related symptoms (p < 0.001), and none had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (p = 0.006)."
CD011926,0,9021540,0,Development of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for diagnosis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection and its use in a prospective surveillance study.,"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is one of several arenaviruses that are pathogenic for humans, causes encephalitis and meningitis in man. In this study, single-stage and nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were developed that targeted the GPC and N genes of LCMV. Both assays detected < 1 TCID50 unit of LCMV. These assays were used to measure the incidence of LCMV infection by testing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples with > or = 10 leukocytes/microl collected over 1 year from patients undergoing lumbar puncture for diagnostic reasons at two Birmingham hospitals. Samples were tested for the presence of LCMV RNA by using the RT- PCR assay and for LCMV-specific IgM antibody by using an ELISA assay. None of the specimens collected from 813 patients was positive by either assay. Although no cases of acute infection were detected, 4% (11/272) of serum collected from a subset of patients was positive for LCMV-specific IgG. A significantly greater rate of seropositivity was found among subjects over 60 years of age (9.4%; P < 0.025) than was found in younger subjects (2.4% at 30-59 years of age; 0% at < 30 years of age). These data suggest that serious central nervous system disease due to LCMV infection is not common in this population. The high rate of seropositivity in those over 60 years of age suggest that infection was once more common."
CD011926,0,21637810,0,Population structure of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae in The Netherlands in the pre-vaccination era assessed by MLVA and capsular sequence typing.,"The introduction of nationwide pneumococcal vaccination may lead to serotype replacement and the emergence of new variants that have expanded their genetic repertoire through recombination. To monitor alterations in the pneumococcal population structure, we have developed and utilized Capsular Sequence Typing (CST) in addition to Multiple-Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA).To assess the serotype of each isolate CST was used. Based on the determination of the partial sequence of the capsular wzh gene, this method assigns a capsular type of an isolate within a single PCR reaction using multiple primersets. The genetic background of pneumococcal isolates was assessed by MLVA. MLVA and CST were used to create a snapshot of the Dutch pneumococcal population causing invasive disease before the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in The Netherlands in 2006. A total of 1154 clinical isolates collected and serotyped by the Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis were included in the snapshot. The CST was successful in discriminating most serotypes present in our collection. MLVA demonstrated that isolates belonging to some serotypes had a relatively high genetic diversity whilst other serotypes had a very homogeneous genetic background. MLVA and CST appear to be valuable tools to determine the population structure of pneumococcal isolates and are useful in monitoring the effects of pneumococcal vaccination."

CD011926,0,26319901,0,A validation of the Danish microbiology database (MiBa) and incidence rate of Actinotignum schaalii (Actinobaculum schaalii) bacteraemia in Denmark.,"Actinotignum schaalii (former named Actinobaculum schaalii) can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bacteraemia, mainly in the elderly. A. schaalii is difficult to identify with conventional biochemical tests, and it is often overlooked if the urine is only cultured in ambient air. The aim of this study was to validate data from the nationwide Danish microbiology database (MiBa) with data from the laboratory information system (LIS) at the local department of microbiology in Viborg-Herning, and to evaluate the incidence rate of bacteraemia caused by A. schaalii in Denmark by using data from the MiBa. All departments of microbiology in Denmark report data to the MiBa. All microbiological samples with A. schaalii in Denmark were extracted for a period of 5 years from the MiBa and from the local LISs. All data obtained from our local LIS were also found in the MiBa, except for data on real-time PCR, which were not registered, owing to missing ID codes in the MiBa. From 2010 to 2014, there was a significant increase in the incidence rate of blood cultures with A. schaalii, from 1.8 to 6.8 cases per million, which was probably due to coincident implementation of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in routine diagnostics. We found that A. schaalii caused bacteraemia and UTIs mainly in the elderly. In conclusion, the MiBa can be a useful source of nationwide microbiological data in Denmark. Our results suggest that the incidence rate of A. schaalii as a cause of bacteraemia has been underestimated, and that culture of urine in CO2 can improve the detection of A. schaalii."

CD011926,0,21054663,0,Invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae in Sweden 1997-2009; evidence of increasing incidence and clinical burden of non-type b strains.,"Introduction of a conjugated vaccine against encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) has led to a dramatic reduction of invasive Hib disease. However, an increasing incidence of invasive disease by H. influenzae non-type b has recently been reported. Non-type b strains have been suggested to be opportunists in an invasive context, but information on clinical consequences and related medical conditions is scarce. In this retrospective study, all H. influenzae isolates (n = 410) from blood and cerebrospinal fluid in three metropolitan Swedish regions between 1997 and 2009 from a population of approximately 3 million individuals were identified. All available isolates were serotyped by PCR (n = 250). We observed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of invasive H. influenzae disease, ascribed to non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) and encapsulated strains type f (Hif) in mainly individuals >60 years of age. The medical reports from a subset of 136 cases of invasive Haemophilus disease revealed that 48% of invasive NTHi cases and 59% of invasive Hif cases, respectively, met the criteria of severe sepsis or septic shock according to the ACCP/SCCM classification of sepsis grading. One-fifth of invasive NTHi cases and more than one-third of invasive Hif cases were admitted to intensive care units. Only 37% of patients with invasive non-type b disease had evidence of immunocompromise, of which conditions related to impaired humoral immunity was the most common. The clinical burden of invasive non-type b H. influenzae disease, measured as days of hospitalization/100 000 individuals at risk and year, increased significantly throughout the study period."

CD011926,0,10973745,0,Diagnosis of horizontal enterovirus infections in neonates by nested PCR and direct sequence analysis.,"A hospital-acquired outbreak with febrile illness and/or rash occurred in our neonatal special care nursery (SCN) from September 1995 to September 1996. A total of 23 infants developed symptoms. We could not detect the etiological agents by routine virus isolation. In a retrospective study, however, enterovirus RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from four out of six cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and from two of 12 sera. Thus six out of 16 patients from whom samples were obtained were diagnosed retrospectively as having enterovirus infection. Furthermore, we detected the enterovirus genome from four of 20 serum samples obtained from patients who had other clinical symptoms, and from infants hospitalized without noticeable clinical illness during the same periods. This outbreak was caused by two different enteroviruses, which we assumed were echovirus type 7 (Echo 7) and coxsackievirus B3 (Cox B3), because of the sequence results. We demonstrated the clinical advantage of the analysis of nucleotide sequencing as supportive evidence of transmission."
CD011926,0,9421770,0,HIV in the neonate.,"Mother-to-infant transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a worldwide problem. Between 7 and 40% of infants born to HIV-positive mothers become infected. The prognosis of these infants is poor, with most developing early and rapidly progressive disease. A number of advances in diagnosis and therapy offer opportunities to reduce the rate of vertical transmission and to improve the outlook of infected infants. Antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and the neonatal period can markedly reduce the risk of mother-to-infant transmission. Recognition that 50% or more of infections are transmitted peripartum offers scope to further reduce the rate of transmission. However there is currently no consensus on the optimal management of pregnancy in HIV-infected women, and there is an urgent need for large randomized controlled trials. The development of polymerase chain reaction and p24 antigen assays has greatly facilitated the diagnosis of neonatal HIV infection, thereby enabling earlier supportive and anti-retroviral therapy. The place of zidovudine in paediatric HIV infection is now well-established, but the future will undoubtedly bring combination anti-retroviral therapy. Optimism about the prospects for developments in the prevention and treatment of paediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome must be tempered by the fact that the majority of cases occur in countries where patients have little or no access to medical care."
CD011926,0,25437026,0,Screening for respiratory syncytial virus and isolation strategies in children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection.,"Nosocomial infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important health risk in pediatric care but is largely preventable by efficient infection control measures. Commonly applied rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) miss a considerable number of RSV-infected patients. The objective of our analysis was to evaluate whether readily available host parameters are associated with false-negative RADT, and to assess how these parameters could be applied in an optimized RSV isolation strategy.We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 242 children under the age of 2 years hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection to identify host parameters associated with false-negative RADT test result. We subsequently simulated the outcome of different isolation strategies based on RADT result and host parameters in view of the overall isolation efficacy.Out of 242 hospitalized patients, 134 (55%) patients were found RSV-positive by RT-PCR, whereas 108 (45%) patients were tested negative. The performance of the RADT was compared with the result obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on the identical nasopharyngeal wash. Overall, we found that 85 patients (35%) were tested true positive, 108 (45%) were tested true negative, whereas a false-negative test result was obtained in 49 patients (20%). Duration of respiratory symptoms for >3 days and a respiratory admission diagnosis are associated with false-negative RADT result. In comparison with RADT alone, consideration of these clinical parameters and RADT result can decrease the rate of nonisolated RSV-infected patients from approximately 24% to 8% (65% RSV pretest probability).Consideration of both RADT and clinical parameters associated with false-negative RADT can result in an optimized RSV infection control policy."

Twenty-eight (31%) infants had confirmed HIV infection and 63 (69%) had seroreverted to HIV and lack evidence of infection. During the first 6 months of life HIV culture had a sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of HIV infection of 80 and 100%, respectively. False negative HIV cultures were observed in only 7 of 35 specimens, 6 from among the 12 infected infants tested at birth. The sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of HIV were 95 and 93% respectively. A single false negative PCR test result was observed among the 19 tests performed on specimens from HIV-infected infants. False positive PCR test results were observed occasionally throughout the first 6 months of life. Detection of HIV-specific IgA antibody lacked diagnostic sensitivity; positive test results were observed in only 53% of specimens obtained from infected infants. Culture and PCR detection offer excellent sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of HIV infection during the first 6 months of life; however, false-negative HIV cultures sometimes are observed, particularly during the newborn period, and either false negative or false positive PCR test results may be noted occasionally. For purposes of clinical decision-making, any positive test result should be confirmed with a second HIV culture or PCR test performed on a separate blood specimen."

New viruses has been searched to explain non-A to non-E viral hepatitis, being reported recently G virus. Epidemiology and clinical aspects has been reviewed identifying unusual clinical forms: choletasic and relapsing hepatitis in HAV infection; escape mutants B virus hepatitis in HVB infection; and the silent evolution to chronicity in more than 70% of cases in HVC infection. Diagnostic techniques has been developed to asses serum antibodies and the virus itself. It is important to quantitate the viral particles in the serum before treatment. PCR technique has been used with good results. A and E virus do not remain in the host and permanent inmunity is obtained after infection is resolved. 10% of B and 80% of C viral hepatitis goes to chronicity. So far, the only drug used to treat chronic viral B, D and C hepatitis is interferon alfa, obtaining good response en 40%. Combinations with Rivabirin and increasing the dose, frequency and duration of interferon treatment are in study. lt is a recomendation to treat acute HCV infection with Interferon alfa to prevent chronicity.

Proteins and glucose of CSF were standard. One CSF was normal. Viral meningitidis was confirmed by viral culture of CSF onto MRC5. Enterovirus were identified by direct immunofluorescence (Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Enterovirus, Dako). Serotyping (Enterovirus antisera, Eurobio, Trousses 4) identified an echovirus 30 in all cases.

Coinfection was not found in these samples. Infections occurred mainly in November, December and January. The key elements of the RT-smPCR are (i) the cDNA synthesis with the Superscript RTII and random primer at 42 degrees C for 1 h, at 99 degrees C for 5 min, and (ii) single-round multiplex PCR by using Taq polymerase mixed together with a mixture of four different primer pairs (G1-SKF/G1-SKR for Norovirus genogroup I, COG2F/G2-SKR for Norovirus genogroup II, SLV5317/SLV5749 for Sapovirus, PreCAP1/82b for astrovirus).

New epidemiological studies should be carried out to elucidate whether additional risk factors exist between these groups."
CD011926,0,23291921,0,Gastrointestinal presentation and outcome of perinatal cytomegalovirus infection.,"A term infant presented at birth with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension. Multiple investigations were undertaken, including two laparotomies and a rectal biopsy, as no obvious cause for his symptoms could be found. This included testing for human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection as part of a TORCH screen, which was negative at 10 days of age. However, a repeat screen at 3 weeks of age demonstrated positive findings of CMV in both urine and blood PCR. This subsequently led to the diagnosis of gastrointestinal pseudoobstruction associated with perinatal CMV infection. This case is of interest though there is limited information regarding the recognition of gastrointestinal symptoms in relation to CMV infection. This report aims to highlight our experience with an infant with perinatal CMV infection and severe gastrointestinal symptoms."

CD011926,0,14516780,0,Ureaplasma in lung. 1. Localization by in situ hybridization in a mouse model.,"Ureaplasma urealyticum is a common inhabitant of mucosal surfaces but is also associated with a higher incidence of pneumonia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. Culture and polymerase chain reaction demonstrate high isolation rates of ureaplasma in clinical specimens documenting their presence but do not associate the organism directly with the diseased tissue. In this study, lung tissue samples from newborn mice inoculated intranasally with U. urealyticum were used to develop an in situ hybridization (ISH) test for the organism. In situ hybridization allows the localization of gene expression for visualization within the context of tissue morphology. New techniques which use biotinyl-tyramide based signal amplification have been able to greatly enhance the sensitivity of ISH. Using the Dako GenPoint Catalyzed Signal Amplification system to detect a biotinylated DNA probe specific for an internal nucleotide sequence within the urease gene of U. urealyticum, the organism was detected within the infected murine lung tissues. Electron microscopy was used to verify the presence of the organisms in the positive ISH areas. The ISH procedure developed in this study can be used to analyze the presence of ureaplasma in human neonatal lung tissue with the corresponding histopathology."

It has a broad range of seasonal and age-related prevalence. We aimed to study the molecular prevalence and seasonality of Cryptosporidium over a period of 1 year in a cohort of Egyptian diarrhoeic patients. Stool samples were collected from 865 diarrhoeic patients attending outpatient clinics of Cairo University hospitals, from all age groups over a 12-month period, examined microscopically for faecal Cryptosporidium oocysts by the acid-fast staining method and for copro-DNA detection using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assays. PCR-positive samples were characterised molecularly by nPCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to determine Cryptosporidium genotypes. Cryptosporidium copro-DNA was detected in 19.5% of the collected samples throughout the year, with a major peak in summer (August) and a small rise in spring (April). Infection was mainly C. hominis (95.8%) followed by C. parvum (3.0%), affecting all age groups, with predominance in the pre-school age group, and decrease with age. There were statistically significant associations between the detection of Cryptosporidium and season, diarrhoea, patient age and drinking water, while gender, contact with animals and presence of mucus in stool showed no association. Cryptosporidium in diarrhoeic Egyptians was of distinct endemicity, with the bi-model mostly influenced by population dynamics, with a clear high prevalence in pre-school children and predominating anthroponotic (C. hominis) transmission throughout the year. The obtained results highlight Cryptosporidium as a water contaminant and an important cause of health problems in Egypt, necessitating further studies of the risk factors."
CD011926,0,11325983,0,Characterization of AfaE adhesins produced by extraintestinal and intestinal human Escherichia coli isolates: PCR assays for detection of Afa adhesins that do or do not recognize Dr blood group antigens.,"Operons of the afa family are expressed by pathogenic Escherichia coli strains associated with intestinal and extraintestinal infections in humans and animals. The recently demonstrated heterogeneity of these operons (L. Lalioui, M. Jouve, P. Gounon, and C. Le Bouguénec, Infect. Immun. 67:5048-5059, 1999) was used to develop a new PCR assay for detecting all the operons of the afa family with a single genetic tool. This PCR approach was validated by investigating three collections of human E. coli isolates originating from the stools of infants with diarrhea (88 strains), the urine of patients with pyelonephritis (97 strains), and the blood of cancer patients (115 strains). The results obtained with this single test and those previously obtained with several PCR assays were closely correlated. The AfaE adhesins encoded by the afa operons are variable, particularly with respect to the primary sequence encoded by the afaE gene. The receptor binding specificities have not been determined for all of these adhesins; some recognize the Dr blood group antigen (Afa/Dr(+) adhesins) on the human decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as a receptor, and others (Afa/Dr(-) adhesins) do not. Thus, the afa operons detected in this study were characterized by subtyping the afaE gene using specific PCRs. In addition, the DAF-binding capacities of as-yet-uncharacterized AfaE adhesins were tested by various cellular approaches. The afaE8 subtype (Afa/Dr(-) adhesin) was found to predominate in afa-positive isolates from sepsis patients (75%); it was frequent in afa-positive pyelonephritis E. coli (55.5%) and absent from diarrhea-associated strains. In contrast, Afa/Dr(+) strains (regardless of the afaE subtype) were associated with both diarrhea (100%) and extraintestinal infections (44 and 25% in afa-positive pyelonephritis and sepsis strains, respectively). These data suggest that there is an association between the subtype of AfaE adhesin and the physiological site of the infection caused by afa-positive strains."
CD011926,0,25782362,0,Hepatitis B immunoprophylaxis failure and the presence of hepatitis B surface gene mutants in the affected children.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is usually vertically transmitted from the mother to child during birth in Asian countries. Despite immunization, immunoprophylaxis failure is well-documented. The aim of the study was to study immunoprophylaxis failure rate in the cohort of infants delivered by chronic HBV-infected mothers and to determine risk factors for failure. This was an observational study involving chronic hepatitis B infected mothers seen at a tertiary care center in Singapore between June 2009 and December 2013. Infants born to these mothers were recruited after they had completed the recommended vaccination schedule. Serological testing for the children was performed 3 months after completion of the last dose of vaccine. HBV surface gene sequencing was carried out if HBV DNA was detectable in the children. Among the 161 mothers enrolled, most were HBeAg negative. HBeAg positive mothers were younger and had a significantly higher viral load (6.5 log) as compared to HBeAg negative mothers (1.35 log) (P < 0.001). Four children (2.6%) were found to have immunoprophylaxis failure. Two occurred in children delivered by mothers with extremely high viral load of more than 5 × 10(7)  IU/ml. HBV surface gene mutations were detected in most children (3 out of 4) with immunoprophylaxis failure. The overall effectiveness of the hepatitis B vaccination program was high. High maternal viral load and presence of surface gene mutants may be potential contributors."

We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of meningococcal LAMP as a near-patient test in the emergency department."
CD011926,0,7597323,0,[Current status of human cytomegalovirus disease].,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can establish lifelong persistence after primary infection with reactivation occurring as a result of immunosuppression. There is much evidence that molecular interactions between the immune system and the HCMV are responsible for immune escape. HCMV in many cells especially in mononuclear blood cells during latency are frequently the source of transmission and spreading and results in a variety of disorders. In this review some data about acute infection in immunocompetent host (mononucleosis, hepatitis), about intrauterine HCMV infection, about infection and endogenous reinfection in bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients (pneumonitis) and about HCMV disease in AIDS patients (encephalitis, neuropathy, retinitis, colitis) are investigated. Moreover, HCMV associated vasculitis is described in patients with myocarditis, rheumatoid arthritis or polyradiculopathy. HCMV could play an important role in atherosclerosis. Several types of human malignancy have been linked to HCMV and it has been shown that HCMV ie genes upregulate expression of cellular oncogenes. The diagnosis of HCMV infection is carried out by viremia in cell culture using immediate early antigen staining, by antigenaemia which appears to be an early quantitative and predictive tool, by HCMV DNA detection using hybridization and PCR, and by IgM and IgG antibody evaluation. Two antiviral drugs are used for treatment: ganciclovir and phosphonoformic acid; few resistant clinical isolates have been reported. Specific gammaglobulin activity is discussed. HCMV vaccine is not available."
CD011926,0,9215652,0,Transmission of HIV-1 in infants born to seropositive mothers: PCR-amplified proviral DNA detected by flow cytometric analysis of immunoreactive beads.,"The diagnosis of HIV infection in newborns is established by amplification of proviral DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We developed a nonisotopic method for heminested PCR using a biotinylated primer among sets of three oligonucleotides, each selected from the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) and gag sequences. An internal probe incorporating digoxigenin-dUTP was also synthesized by PCR. The PCR products, hybridized with LTR region or gag region probes, were captured with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antidigoxigenin in flow cytometric analysis. This immunoreactive bead assay (PCR-IRB) detected about three copies of HIV proviral DNA. A panel of 50 coded DNA specimens of infants previously assayed by conventional PCR and with known clinical results revealed that the PCR-IRB findings using LTR, but not gag, were in agreement. A double-blind prospective study of blood samples from 14 mother-infant pairs using the PCR-IRB amplification of LTR gave results similar to the commercial Amplicor HIV-1 PCR test and were consistent with the clinical outcomes. PCR-IRB results were positive for 11 mothers and three infants, one at birth, one at 2 weeks after birth, and one at 8 weeks after birth. PCR-IRB is a simple, reliable, specific, and automatable assay useful in the early diagnosis of perinatal HIV infection in clinical practice and regional screening programs."

We examined associations between pathogens and composition of gut microbiota as they relate to Shigella spp./enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection. We analyzed 3,035 stool specimens (1,735 nondiarrheal and 1,300 moderate-to-severe diarrheal) from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study for 9 enteropathogens. Diarrheal specimens had a higher number of enteropathogens (diarrheal mean 1.4, nondiarrheal mean 0.95; p<0.0001). Rotavirus showed a negative association with Shigella spp. in cases of diarrhea (odds ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.17-0.55) and had a large combined effect on moderate-to-severe diarrhea (odds ratio 29, 95% CI 3.8-220). In 4 Lactobacillus taxa identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the association between pathogen and disease was decreased, which is consistent with the possibility that Lactobacillus spp. are protective against Shigella spp.-induced diarrhea. Bacterial diversity of gut microbiota was associated with diarrhea status, not high levels of the Shigella spp. ipaH gene."

CD011926,0,18687498,0,Evaluation of different methods for the detection and identification of Enterobacter sakazakii isolated from South African infant formula milks and the processing environment.,"Enterobacter sakazakii is an emerging pathogen associated with life-threatening neonatal infections resulting from the consumption of contaminated powdered infant formula milk (IFM). Recent taxonomic analyses have determined that E. sakazakii comprises a number of genomospecies, and it has been proposed that E. sakazakii be reclassified as a novel genus, ""Cronobacter"". Accurate methods are required for the rapid detection and identification of this group of micro-organisms, since even low cell numbers have been reported to cause disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate various E. sakazakii detection methods in order to ascertain the most suitable method for detection and identification of these pathogenic agents. Samples from IFM and the environment were evaluated for the presence of E. sakazakii using the isolation steps (pre-enrichment, enrichment and selection) described in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) method for E. sakazakii detection. Sixty-four isolates (50 from IFM and 14 from the environment) were selected from tryptone soy agar (TSA), regardless of colony appearance, and these isolates were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing. Thereafter, different culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were evaluated to accurately detect and identify the E. sakazakii isolates. These methods included the assessment of yellow pigment production on TSA, typical colonies on chromogenic Druggan-Forsythe-Iversen (DFI) and Chromocult Enterobacter sakazakii (CES) media and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using six different species-specific primer pairs described in the literature. Identification of E. sakazakii using yellow pigment production was demonstrated to have a low sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (87%, 71% and 74%, respectively), which lowers the suitability of the FDA method. Chromogenic DFI and CES media were sensitive, specific and accurate (100%, 98% and 98%, respectively) for the detection of E. sakazakii. The specificity of the PCR amplifications ranged from 8% to 92%, emphasising the need for rigorous primer testing against closely related species. Of the primer pairs evaluated, Esakf/Esakr were the most suitable for E. sakazakii detection and identification. The detection limit of Esakf/Esakr was found to be 10(4) CFU/ml. This study demonstrated that no single method was capable of unambiguously confirming the presence and identity of E. sakazakii isolates, that each method had inherent advantages and disadvantages, and that in most cases several methods were required for accurate detection and identification. Further, it was demonstrated that the current FDA method for E. sakazakii detection should be revised in the light of the availability of more sensitive, specific and accurate detection methods."
CD011926,0,9504113,0,[Advances in the molecular diagnosis of infectious and parasitic diseases].,"During the last decade molecular diagnostic techniques have moved from the research laboratory into the clinical microbiology laboratory. The application of molecular biology for the diagnosis of infections and parasitic diseases by the detection of nucleic acids has steadily grown, and it is very probably that, while they may not displace the traditional diagnostic laboratory, they will be common place in the not to distant future. A detailed description of the principal molecular diagnostic techniques that are currently being used or that have a potential use for the diagnosis, evaluation of disease progression or response to therapy of selected infectious and parasitic diseases, is presented. Emphasis is placed on the rational use of these techniques in regional reference laboratories or highly specialized hospitals; the importance of selecting and implanting those diagnostic techniques with the highest cost-benefit ratio; and finally, the need to train human resources which are highly qualified in the theory and practice of molecular biology."
CD011926,0,10921378,0,Natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in adults with emphasis on the occurrence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.,"The natural course of perinatally acquired hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has three phases. In the first 'immune tolerance phase', patients are HBeAg positive and have high serum levels of HBV DNA, but have no symptoms, normal ALT levels and minimal histological activity. The second 'immune clearance phase' usually occurs between 15 and 35 years of age, during which HBV replication declines, accompanied by increased serum ALT levels and inflammatory activity in the liver; HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion is then observed, frequently preceded by a flare of the ALT level. The average rate of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion is 10% per year. In the third 'low-replicative phase', serum HBsAg persists, but HBeAg is no longer detectable and HBV DNA can only be detected by PCR assay. During this phase, patients are usually asymptomatic and liver disease is inactive; some patients, however, may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The ultimate outcome of chronic HBV infection appears to depend on the duration and severity of liver injury during the immune clearance phase. About 2.1% of patients with chronic type B hepatitis develop cirrhosis each year. Patients who have a severe acute exacerbation complicated by subacute hepatic failure or who have recurrent episodes of acute exacerbations with bridging hepatic necrosis are more likely to develop cirrhosis. A significant proportion of those with HBsAg eventually develop HCC; they have a 100-fold increased risk of HCC relative to those without. The development of HCC, however, is closely related to the severity of the underlying liver disease. The annual incidence of HCC is only 0.1% in asymptomatic HBsAg individual, 1% in patients with chronic hepatitis B, but increases to 3-10% in patients with cirrhosis. Some anti-HBe-positive patients continue to have active liver disease and they should be tested for HBV DNA by hybridization assay to determine whether the disease results from replicative precore mutant HBV infection or other causes of liver disease, such as superinfection with HCV and HDV. A substantial number of apparently healthy HBV-infected individuals are first recognized when they present with episodes of acute hepatitis. About 30% of these cases could be attributed to other hepatotropic virus superinfection. Acute viral hepatitis in patients with concurrent HBV infection is associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic failure. Finally, HBsAg disappears from serum in about 1% of patients each year. HCV superinfection can enhance the termination of HBsAg positivity. HCV, however, replaces HBV as the dominant cause of chronic viral hepatitis. The outcome of HBV-infected persons with 'spontaneous' seroclearance of HBsAg is usually favourable, though progress to cirrhosis and HCC is still possible."

The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize hMPV in samples collected from children <5 years presenting with acute respiratory disease (ARD) seen at a public hospital in Uberlândia, in Southeastern Brazil. One hundred fourteen nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) samples that were negative for the presence of nine other respiratory viruses were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of hMPV RNA. Fourteen out of 114 (12.3%) samples were positive for presence of hMPV RNA. PCR products, obtained by the amplification of partial nucleotide sequence of gene N, were sequenced and compared with sequences deposited in GenBank. Sequences from eight samples were obtained and all four subtypes were identified. Also, the recently proposed sublineages ""a"" and ""b"" of subtype A2 were found; mean age was 21 months old; upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was the most common clinical symptom; the virus was detected in samples collected from March to November, a period that corresponds to late summer to mid-spring in Brazil.

A total of 358 pregnant women in their first trimester of pregnancy, most of them were asymptomatic while the others suffered lymphadenopathy, fever and/or malaise. The serum sample from each woman was screened for Toxoplasma-specific ELISA IgM & IgG. Sero-negative females were then screened in 2nd & 3rd trimesters for sero-conversion. Amniocentesis was performed to seropositive and sero-converted women. Detection of Toxoplasma DNA in AF was done by animal inoculation and PCR targeting P30 gene. 85/358 women were sero-positive for Toxoplasma. Congenital infection was detected in 14/85 fetuses by MI. One mouse had tachyzoite in peritoneal exudate while other 13 showed cysts in histpathological sections of mice. PCR test targeting P30 gene was positive in 13 with additional four fetuses, only PCR gave positive results, and serologic follow-up of suspected fetuses (17) by IgM ELISA confirmed congenital toxoplasmosis. Sixteen cases of congenitally infected newborn were a symptomatic. One was clinically diagnosed (ventricular dilatation) by the ultrasound. The PCR drastically changed the diagnostic repertoire for prenatal diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR targeting P30 gene on AF samples were 92.9% & 94.4% respectively while positive predictive value (PPV) was 76.5%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 98.5%. Its disadvantages were in fact that negative result cannot exclude acute infection, and thus must be confirmed by MI and it is also an expensive technique."

The point prevalence of asymptomatic infection was 98 per 1000 persons at baseline. There was no statistically significant difference between rk-39 and PCR positivity rate (P>0.05), even though PCR positivity alone was found significantly higher (4.2%) than rk-39 positivity alone (2.6%). The monthly follow-up of the asymptomatic cohort revealed a disease conversion rate of 23.1 per 100 persons within a year. There was a statistically significant difference in conversion of disease when individuals were positive by both tests as compared to single tests by rk-39 and PCR (P<0.01). Disease conversion rate in the subjects residing in households with a history of VL (62%, 13/21) was higher than those residing in the households without a history of VL (38%, 8/21). Most of the identified asymptomatic individuals were from low socio-economic strata similar to that of VL cases in general. Apart from rk-39, PCR may be considered for screening of asymptomatic Leishmania donovani infection in large-scale epidemiological studies. Screening of asymptomatic cases and their close follow-up to ascertain early detection and treatment of VL may be considered in addition to the existing VL control strategies."

Ent. hormaechei is spread via horizontal transfer and is often associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production, which increases the challenges associated with treatment by limiting therapeutic options. This report considers 10 strains of Ent. hormaechei (identified by 16S rDNA sequencing) that had originally been identified by phenotyping as Cronobacter (Enterobacter) sakazakii. Seven strains were from different neonates during a nosocomial outbreak in a California hospital. PFGE analysis revealed a clonal relationship among six of the seven isolates and therefore a previously unrecognized Ent. hormaechei outbreak had occurred over a three-month period. Antibiotic-resistance profiles were determined and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase activity was detected. The association of the organism with powdered infant formula, neonatal hosts and Cr. sakazakii suggested that the virulence of these organisms may be similar. Virulence traits were tested and all strains were shown to invade both gut epithelial (Caco-2) and blood-brain barrier endothelial cells (rBCEC4), and to persist in macrophages (U937). Due to misidentification we suggest that Ent. hormaechei may be an under-reported cause of bacterial infection, especially in neonates. Also, its isolation from various sources, including powdered infant milk formula, makes it a cause for concern and merits further investigation."

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a 300-bp segment of the CMV gB gene which was detected in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. A centrifugation-enhanced microtiter culture method with a monoclonal antibody for the detection of early-antigen fluorescent foci (DEAFF) was also used. Saliva specimens were collected with mouth swabs from children who were between the ages of 1 month and 14 years and who had either prenatal or perinatal CMV infection. One hundred sixty samples were tested by PCR and TC; 65 (40.6%) were found positive by TC, and 58 (36.8%) were found positive by PCR. Although four samples were found positive by PCR and negative by TC, saliva from seronegative and seropositive TC-negative adults were never found positive by PCR. One hundred fifty-two samples were tested by DEAFF and TC; 64 (42.1%) were found positive by TC, and 58 (38.2%) were found positive by DEAFF. With TC results as a standard, the sensitivity and specificity of DEAFF were, respectively, 90.6 and 97.7%. Because of the greater ease of collecting saliva than urine from newborns, both of these rapid methods merit evaluation in screening for congenital infection."

Clindamycin resistance may be inducible or constitutive, and the rates of inducible resistance in CA-MRSA that could produce clindamycin treatment failures vary worldwide. The double-disk test was performed in 197 erythromycin-resistant and clindamycin-susceptible CA-MRSA strains from children in Dallas, Texas, from 1999 to 2002 to determine inducible clindamycin resistance. Resistance mechanisms were studied by PCR; epidemiologic trends were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Inducible resistance was demonstrated in 28 (93%+/-6%) of 30 tested isolates in 1999, 21 (64%, +/-11%) of 33 in 2000, 12 (23%+/-7%) of 52 in 2001, and 6 (7%+/-3%) of 82 in 2002. All noninducible strains had the msr(A) gene. Among inducible resistant strains, 31 had erm(B), 24 had erm(C), and 12 had erm(A) genes. Two distinct pulsed types were the most prevalent; one of them was the most common pulsed type in 1999, whereas in 2002 a different pulsed type was prevalent. MLST analyses determined that ST-8 was the most common type, with 76%+/-5% found in 2002. All but one of these clindamycin-susceptible, erythromycin-resistant ST-8 strains showed no induction of clindamycin resistance. We conclude that, among erythromycin-resistant, clindamycin-susceptible CA-MRSA strains isolated from children in Dallas, inducible methylase resistance became less common from 1999 to 2002 (P<0.001). The phenotype of strains was associated with their sequence type. Our results demonstrate a clonal shift in CA-MRSA in Dallas children from 1999 to 2002."

CD011926,0,25381805,0,Development and implementation challenges of a quality assured HIV infant diagnosis program in Nigeria using dried blood spots and DNA polymerase chain reaction.,"Nigeria has one of the highest HIV burdens as well as mother-to-infant transmission rates in the world. A pilot program using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing of dried blood spot (DBS) specimens was implemented to enable early identification of HIV-infected infants and timely referral and linkage to care. From February 2007 to October 2008, whole blood was collected by finger prick to prepare DBS from infants <18 months presenting in six public mother-and-child health facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. The DBS were tested using the Roche Amplicor HIV-1 DNA Test, v1.5. To monitor laboratory testing quality, all of the PCR-positive and 10% of the PCR-negative DBS were retested by the same method at another reference laboratory. Three hundred and sixty-five randomly selected infants were screened using HIV rapid tests (RT) according to the national algorithm and RT-negative and PCR-positive specimens were also tested using Genscreen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) (Bio-Rad, France). The turnaround time (TAT) from sample collection, testing, and dispatching of results from each health facility was monitored. A total of 1,273 infants with a median age of 12.6 weeks (1 day to 71.6 weeks) participated in the program and 280 (22.0%) were PCR positive. HIV transmission levels varied greatly in the different health facilities ranging from 7.1% to 38.4%. Infants aged 48 to 72 weeks had the highest level of PCR positivity (41.1%). All PCR-positive specimens were confirmed by retesting. The mean turnaround time from DBS collection to returning of the laboratory result to the health facilities was 25 days. Three infants were found to be HIV antibody negative by rapid tests but were positive by both PCR and the fourth generation EIA. The DBS-based PCR program accurately identified all of the HIV-infected infants. However, many programmatic challenges related to the laboratory and TAT were identified."

Also, few studies have directly compared the different gene targets for routine laboratory diagnostic usage in PCR assays. We examined 87 specimens from 68 patients attending two urban sexually transmitted disease clinics in Alberta, Canada. PCR was used to amplify the T. pallidum tpp47, bmp, and polA genes as well as a specific region of the 23S rRNA gene linked to macrolide antibiotic susceptibility. In primary syphilis cases, PCR was positive exclusively (75% sensitivity rate) in ulcerative swabs but not in blood specimens, while in secondary syphilis cases, 50% of the blood specimens were positive by PCR. Four out of 14 (28.6%) of our PCR-positive syphilis cases were found to be caused by an azithromycin-resistant strain(s). Our results confirmed that swabs from primary ulcers are the specimens of choice for laboratory diagnostic purposes. However, further research is required to determine what specimen(s) would be most appropriate for molecular investigation of syphilis in secondary and latent syphilis."

The preoperative MRIs were reviewed by one neuroradiologist who did not know the radiologic diagnosis and the pathology reports. MRI revealed focal cortical dysplasia (10), hemimegalencephaly (3), hamartomas (2), polymicrogyria (1), pial hemosiderosis (1), and no abnormality (1). Pathologic examination revealed focal cortical dysplasia (9), forme fruste of tuberous sclerosis (5), hemimegalencephaly (3), and focal cortical dysplasia with mesial temporal sclerosis (1). MRI was accurate in making the preoperative diagnosis in 16 out of 18 patients. On MRI, 12 patients had abnormal gyral formation and 12 had abnormal cortical thickness. Eleven patients manifested loss of gray-white differentiation, and 11 patients had abnormal signal on T(2)-weighted image. Pathologically, 15 patients had neuronal heterotopia, 12 had misalignment or disorientation of neurons, 11 had large neurons, and 10 had abnormal cortical lamination. The presence of ectopic and large neurons and abnormal cortical lamination may be responsible for the MRI characteristics."

The prevalence and clinical characteristics of hMPV were determined in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children in Changsha, China. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen for both hMPV and other common respiratory viruses in 1,165 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from children with lower respiratory tract infections from September 2007 to August 2008. All PCR products were sequenced, and demographic and clinical data were collected from all patients. Seventy-six of 1,165 (6.5%) specimens were positive for hMPV, of which 85.5% (65/76) occurred in the winter and spring seasons. The hMPV coinfection rate was 57.9% (44/76), and human bocavirus was the most common virus detected in conjunction with hMPV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 94.7% of the hMPV detected were of subgroup A2, 5.3% were subgroup B2, and none belonged to either the A1 or B1 subgroups. No significant differences were found in terms of the frequency of diagnosis and clinical signs between either the co- and mono-infection groups, or between patients with and without underlying diseases. It was concluded that hMPV is an important viral pathogen in pediatric patients with lower respiratory tract infections in Changsha. Only hMPV genotypes A2 and B2 were co-circulating in this locality; human bocavirus was the most common coinfecting virus, and coinfection did not affect disease severity."

The serotypes of rotaviruses that lead to the hospitalisation of children with acute diarrhoea were determined from June 1999 to May 2000. We examined 1126 rotavirus specimens using a combination of monoclonal antibody immunoassay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and hybridisation. The four most common serotypes G1-G4 were represented. More than 50% of isolates tested were serotype G1, with serotype G1 being represented in most centres Australia-wide. Serotype G9 rotaviruses were identified for the first time in Australia, and were second in importance with 10% of samples tested. The significant presence of G9 viruses throughout Australia suggests the emergence of a new serotype and has implications for current rotavirus vaccine strategies that target serotypes G1-G4."
CD011926,0,15685144,0,Neonatal herpes: what have we learned.,"Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection usually is acquired during the birth process, as the neonate comes in contact with the virus during passage through an infected birth canal. After an incubation period which can last as long as 2 to 4 weeks, neonatal HSV disease then manifests in 1 of 3 ways: (1) disseminated disease, with visceral organ involvement (including infection of the brain in two-thirds to three-quarters of patients); (2) central nervous system disease (with no other visceral organ involvement, but with skin lesions in two-thirds of patients); or (3) disease limited to the skin, eyes, and/or mouth (ie, SEM disease). Diagnostic advances in recent years have focused primarily on applying polymerase chain reaction technology to babies suspected of having neonatal HSV disease. Treatment of neonatal HSV disease with intravenous acyclovir has improved the likelihood of survival substantially, although neurologic morbidity remains a common sequelae, especially among survivors of central nervous system disease. Despite these advances, the duration of time from onset of symptoms and initiation of antiviral therapy has remained unchanged for the past 20 years. The surest way to improve outcomes rapidly at this point is to raise awareness of neonatal HSV disease, resulting in the establishment of earlier diagnoses and more rapid institution of antiviral therapy. In the longer term, development of a bedside nucleic acid detection kit for real-time detection of HSV DNA in the maternal genital tract at the time of delivery could identify which babies are at risk of developing neonatal HSV disease."
CD011926,0,10459487,0,A colorimetric microtiter plate PCR system detects respiratory syncytial virus in nasal aspirates and discriminates subtypes A and B.,"We developed a colorimetric microtiter plate (MTP) PCR system for specific detection of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nucleocapsid gene and differentiation of viral subtypes A and B. Of 47 pediatric nasal aspirate specimens, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.4% (17 of 18) and 100% (15 of 15), respectively, when compared with RSV cell culture isolation in HEp-2 cells. An additional 14 specimens positive for adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, influenza, or parainfluenza viruses did not give positive reactions. PCR testing detected a mean of 0.15 (0.01 to 7.00) plaque-forming units of RSV virions. Inhibition of PCR amplification was detected in 33.3% (6/18) of undiluted specimens and could be avoided by a dilution (1:10) of extracted RNA without decreasing test sensitivity. RSV subtype, as determined by allele-specific probes, was identical to that determined by an immunofluorescence assay. These results indicate that the MTP PCR system provides a sensitive and specific test for clinical laboratory diagnosis and simultaneous subgroup classification of RSV infection."

All patients were microbiologically confirmed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture. Thirty one patients with positive Bordetella spp. culture or PCR were identified, with a median age of two months. Seventeen patients had received no pertussis vaccination. The most frequent symptoms were paroxysmal cough (100%) and cyanosis (87.1%). The mean duration of the symptoms prior to admission was 12.8 ± 8.0 days. Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis were detected in 64.3% and 67.9% of the 28 hospitalized patients, respectively. Erythromycin had been given to eight patients and clarithromycin to 23 patients. The mean hospital stay was 9.5 ± 5.5 days (range: 3 to 28 days). No patients were readmitted or died. We believe that patients with characteristic paroxysmal cough with cyanosis but no fever should alert clinicians to the possibility of pertussis, and they should be treated without delay. PCR assay provided additional benefit in the diagnoses of the study patients."

Virological diagnosis of EV meningitis is currently based on the detection of the viral genome in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This study attempted to determine the correlation and the temporality of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in serum and CSF and to evaluate the possibility of diagnosing EV infection only on the serum PCR. The EV genome was sought by RT real-time PCR (Smart Cycler EV Primer and Probe Set(®), Cepheid) in CSF and serum, collected at the same time, for all children who underwent a lumbar puncture for suspected meningitis, between 1 June and 31 July 2010 at the Versailles Hospital. Forty-four patients were included in the study. EV infection was documented for 22 of them. In 10 patients, the EV genome was detected in CSF only; in 3 patients in serum only, and in 9 patients in both. Among patients with acute EV neurological infection, viremic children were significantly younger (1.6 months versus 5.8 years; P<0.001). Viremia was detected when the serum was sampled within 30 h after the beginning of symptoms. These results confirm previous reports of early and transient viremia in young children. This preliminary study shows the limits and added value of EV PCR in serum. It suggests that in some children and under certain conditions (age >3 months, clinical and biological compatibility with a viral infection, no previous antibiotic therapy, time from symptom onset to blood sampling <30 h, PCR in serum analyzed within 3h), PCR in serum, when positive, is a possible alternative. Therefore, it may be possible to diagnose EV infection without performing a lumbar puncture in a limited number of young children (11.4% of our suspected cases). This study needs to be reinforced by a multicenter study with a broader panel of patients."
CD011926,0,9028718,0,A search for evidence of viral infection in pancreases of newly diagnosed patients with IDDM.,Techniques were developed to look for evidence of viral infection in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded autopsy pancreatic tissues from patients who had died of recent-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. DNA extracted from 47 pancreases in which good DNA preservation was confirmed was analysed by a polymerase chain reaction for Epstein-Barr virus and by a nested polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus. Histological sections from 29 pancreases in which there was good RNA preservation were tested for the presence of enterovirus and Epstein-Barr virus using in situ hybridization techniques. Seventy-five pancreases were analysed immunohistochemically for the presence of mumps virus. None of these viruses could be detected in any of the diabetic pancreases studied. Control studies suggested that the techniques employed were as sensitive as culture done at the time of autopsy. Pancreas was available for study in 9 infants who had died of myocarditis; enterovirus was demonstrable in islets in 5 of these cases. An acute or persisting infection in the pancreas at the time of clinical onset of insulin-dependent diabetes by any of the 4 virus included in this study seems unlikely.

CD011926,0,1939564,0,Identification of Toxoplasma gondii infections by BI gene amplification.,"The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in congenitally infected children or in immunocompromised patients can be difficult; serology is not reliable, and the diagnosis must be based on the combination of symptomatology and the direct demonstration of the parasite in clinical specimens by microscopy, antigen detection, or inoculation of samples into mice or tissue cultures. These techniques are either insensitive or time-consuming. To determine the value of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infections, we compared this technique with conventional detection techniques, such as microscopy, tissue culturing, and mouse inoculation. We were able to detect T. gondii by PCR in clinical specimens and tissue samples that were obtained postmortem from a bone marrow recipient with cerebral toxoplasmosis and from three congenitally infected children. The presence of T. gondii was demonstrated in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, the heart, and skeletal muscle tested fresh or after fixation in Formalin. In only one sample was T. gondii isolated by mouse inoculation but not detected by PCR. Because it is a sensitive, relatively rapid, and specific method and because it can be applied to a variety of different clinical samples, PCR can be considered a valuable additional tool for the identification of T. gondii infections."

Dried infant formula milk has been identified as a potential source of the organism. E. sakazakii isolates from dried infant formula available in Canada and clinical isolates obtained from Canadian hospital culture collections were characterised by phenotypic (biotype and antibiograms) and genotypic (ribotyping, random amplification of polymorphic DNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) methods. Three biotypes and four antibiogram patterns were observed in the 18 isolates examined. Ribotyping with the Dupont Riboprinter microbial identification system divided the 18 isolates into 10 ribotypes. Three isolates from the same hospital had indistinguishable ribotyping patterns although each was isolated in a different year, as did three food isolates from one company. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles indicated minor differences between the isolates that were indistinguishable by ribotyping. PFGE (with the restriction endonucleases Xba1 and Spe1) and RAPD gave discrete patterns that enabled easy comparison of E. sakazakii isolates, with a high degree of discrimination.

CD011926,0,26324734,0,Association Between Shigella Infection and Diarrhea Varies Based on Location and Age of Children.,"Molecular identification of the invasion plasmid antigen-H (ipaH) gene has been established as a useful detection mechanism for Shigella spp. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) identified the etiology and burden of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia using a case-control study and traditional culture techniques. Here, we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to identify Shigella spp. in 2,611 stool specimens from GEMS and compared these results to those using culture. Demographic and nutritional characteristics were assessed as possible risk factors. The qPCR identified more cases of shigellosis than culture; however, the distribution of demographic characteristics was similar by both methods. In regression models adjusting for Shigella quantity, age, and site, children who were exclusively breast-fed had significantly lower odds of MSD compared with children who were not breast-fed (odds ratio [OR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.28-0.81). The association between Shigella quantity and MSD increased with age, with a peak in children of 24-35 months of age (OR = 8.2, 95% CI = 4.3-15.7) and the relationship between Shigella quantity and disease was greatest in Bangladesh (OR = 13.2, 95% CI = 7.3-23.8). This study found that qPCR identified more cases of Shigella and age, site, and breast-feeding status were significant risk factors for MSD."
CD011926,0,14971549,0,Spinal muscular atrophy in the neonate.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type I is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by loss of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord. This severe hereditary neurodegenerative disorder is an important cause of morbidity in the neonate and the leading hereditary cause of infant mortality. The characteristic degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord leads to progressive muscular weakness and atrophy of the skeletal muscles. In SMA type I, the most severe form of SMA, death usually ensues by 2 years of age from respiratory failure or infection. Accurate diagnosis is now available through genetic testing, and progress is being made toward the development of therapy based on understanding of the disease mechanism. The neonatal nurse plays a pivotal role in identifying and caring for these medically fragile infants and in providing support and education for parents and families."

CD011926,0,9475103,0,Intrachromosomal triplication of distal 7p.,"A female infant who died at 2 years of age with growth and psychomotor retardation, wide anterior fontanelle, downward slanting palpebral fissures, large, simple ears, joint dislocation/contractures, recurrent infections, and severe pulmonary hypertension was found to have a de novo 7p+ chromosome. The G banding pattern was suggestive of a triplication of 7p21.3 and 7p22; results of fluorescence in situ hybridisation studies using a chromosome 7 specific library, a subtelomeric 7p repeat (109A6), and yeast artificial chromosome clones 786g1 and 850a1, which are respectively associated with the (CA)n repeat markers D7S517 and D7S513, supported the cytogenetic interpretation and showed that the middle repeat was inverted. The patient's phenotype was consistent with the 7p duplication syndrome, allowing for the effects of the extra burden introduced by the partial tetrasomy. The present rearrangement may have resulted from several meiotic events occurring at the four chromatid stage, namely an unequal crossover or interhomologue translocation with points of exchange at 7p22 and 7p15 followed by the inverted insertion of 7p21.3-->p21.2 at the former breakpoint junction; moreover, a further duplication including D7S517 within the terminal 7p22 band is also required."
CD011926,0,10232785,0,Polymerase chain reaction reveals Trypanosoma cruzi infection suspected by serology in cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis patients.,"The existence of patients suffering a double infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. has been suggested by several authors. Since the conventional serological tests now available for the diagnosis of Chagas' disease lack specificity due to the cross-reactivity between these two parasites, a serological confirmation of a T. cruzi infection cannot be made unless specific antigens are used. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies against a specific T. cruzi antigen, named Ag163B6, and immunoblotting using T. cruzi epimastigotes, are non-conventional serological techniques that could be employed for specific diagnosis of Chagas' disease. Using these two methods 34 cutaneous or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis patients were classified into two groups: (A) patients with serological evidence of T. cruzi infection, i.e. those who tested positive in at least one assay (18/34); and (B) patients with no serological evidence of T. cruzi infection, i.e. those who were negative for both assays (16/34). Taking into account the difficulties of xenodiagnosis and its low sensitivity (less than 50%) for a direct diagnosis in the chronic period of the disease, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm a T. cruzi infection in those leishmaniasis patients who presented positive results with the non-conventional serological techniques. Of the 18 patients with serological evidence of T. cruzi infection, 17 gave positive results when genomic DNA primers were used. Using minicircle primers, 15/18 of that group were positive. Nevertheless, all the patients suspected of being double infected were positive in at least one PCR test. Just one patient with no serological evidence of T. cruzi infection gave a positive PCR result when amplifying the minicircle sequence. The proof of the existence of a T. cruzi infection by PCR in leishmaniasis patients suspected to be chagasic when non-conventional serology was used, strongly supports the use of the specific Ag163B6 and immunoblotting with epimastigotes as specific serological diagnostic tools to determine a T. cruzi infection."

However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria."

The overall incidence of astrovirus was found to be 4.9%. Mixed infections with other enteric agents were detected in 17.2% of all astrovirus-positive samples. During the 3-year period, the highest astrovirus incidence was reported in the winter months, although infections also occurred in summer. The peak detection rate was observed in children between 2 and 4 years of age. Overall, HAstV-1 was the most prevalent type, followed by HAstV-4, HAstV-3, HAstV-8, and HAstV-2. HAstV-5, HAstV-6, and HAstV-7 were not detected during these 3 years. From our serotype data for each age group, we observed that HAstV-1, HAstV-2, and HAstV-3 affected mostly children younger than 3 years of age, while HAstV-4 and HAstV-8 had a greater impact in older children. Genetic variability was analyzed between astroviruses isolated in Barcelona and strains isolated in other parts of the world. A fourth lineage was described for HAstV-1, most likely due to the large number of assayed samples, which may also explain the high level of genetic variability observed in the astrovirus isolates."
CD011926,0,24880467,0,Molecular screening for 22Q11.2 deletion syndrome in patients with congenital heart disease.,"Few studies have investigated the prevalence of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) among patients with isolated heart defects or nonconotruncal heart defects. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by length polymorphism restriction fragment analysis (RFLP) is useful for low-cost molecular diagnosis and screening. This cross-sectional study included 392 patients with congenital heart disease, described clinical features, and performed PCR-RFLP for analysis of polymorphism in three loci with a high heterozygosity rate located in the typically deleted region of 1.5 megabases. Heterozygosity excluded 22q11.2DS. Patients with homozygosity for the three markers underwent multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the final diagnosis, estimating the prevalence of 22q11.2DS. The use of PCR-RFLP excluded 22q11.2DS in 81.6 % (n = 320) of 392 patients. Of the remaining 72 patients, 65 underwent MLPA, showing 22q11.2DS in five cases (prevalence, 1.27 %). Four of these five patients underwent FISH, confirming the MLPA results. All five patients with the deletion had heart diseases commonly found with 22q11.2DS (interrupted aortic arch, persistent truncus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventricular septal defect plus atrial septal defect). Two patients had congenital extracardiac anomaly (one with arched palate and micrognathia and one with hypertelorism). Three patients reported recurrent respiratory infections, and one patient reported hypocalcemia. All were underweight or short in stature for their age. This study contributed to showing the prevalence of 22q11.2DS in patients with any congenital heart disease, with or without other features of the syndrome. Patients with 22q11.2DS may not have all the major features of the syndrome, and those that are found may be due to the heart defect."

CD011926,0,10659543,0,Somatic growth and clinical manifestation in formula fed infants born to HIV--infected mothers during the first year of life.,"This was a comparative study of the growth and clinical manifestation between infected and uninfected HIV infants both of whom were fed with a limited quantity of powder milk from birth until one year of age. HIV-infected pregnant women were enrolled from the second trimester or the beginning of the third trimester. After birth, infants had physical examinations, body weight and height were recorded at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 month visits. All mothers were given 7 kilograms of infant formula at each infant visit until the infant was one year old. Diagnosis for HIV infection in these infants was made by two positive concordant results of DNA PCR or RNA PCR or HIV RNA. One hundred and two infants were diagnosed for HIV status and 21.5 per cent were infected. The infected infants showed signs of malnutrition. From 2-4 months of age, the averages of their weights and heights were lower than those of non-infected infants. Abnormal clinical signs were found in most infected infants by the time they were 9-12 months old. In conclusion for the infants born to HIV- infected mothers, monitoring signs and symptoms including their weight and height from birth till 9-12 months old, is predictive of the infectious status of most infected infants. The administration and management of infant formula in a limited quantity to HIV infected mothers in upper northern provinces of Thailand is possible without causing abnormal infant growth."

CD011926,0,9842445,0,Characterisation of an echovirus type 11' (prime) epidemic strain causing haemorrhagic syndrome in newborn babies in Hungary.,"Echovirus 11' (prime) isolates from an epidemic of haemorrhagic syndrome in departments of obstetrics in Hungary have been characterised. The leading component of the clinical disease was carditis and its lethal outcome occurred in 13 newborn babies. Maternal immunity was found to be absent even in women of 41 years of age. The application of monovalent oral poliovirus type 1 vaccine prevented the progress of the epidemic within two weeks. Nevertheless, a serological survey among primovacinees of 3-15 months of age revealed that 20% of the babies seroconverted without clinical symptoms during the epidemic. Serological evidence showed that the echovirus 11' infection was unable to interfere with the efficacy of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), since seroconversion rates of primovaccinees did not differ significantly from those in the group seroconverted also to echovirus 11' during the vaccination campaign. A 440 nucleotide (nt) fragment of the 5'-non-translated region of 12 epidemic echovirus 11' isolates and 26 echovirus prototype strains was amplified by a nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analysed using three different restriction endonucleases. The 5'-regions of the echovirus 11' isolates were found to be identical to each other but different from that of the prototype echovirus 11 (Gregory) strain. The results indicate that echovirus 11' isolates underwent genetic changes in the 5'-end and P1 region of the genome before the onset of the epidemic."

Out of 40, three subjects were found to contain the HTLV-I provirus genome. These three subjects remained HTLV-I sequence-positive in follow-up study. On the other hand, when examined by a conventional technique for detection of HTLV-I-associated antigen on peripheral mononuclear cells, all 40 neonates were HTLV-I-associated antigen-negative. These results suggest that PCR is more sensitive than the conventional antigen detection method and is useful in early detection of HTLV-I infection in neonates born to HTLV-I carriers."

All 22 belonged to one of two distinct methicillin-resistant phenotypes (class 3 or 2), which were precisely identified as belonging to two distinct genotypes. Genotypic classification was based on restriction analysis of chromosomal DNA with EcoRI and HindIII and Southern analysis of ClaI digests using two DNA probes. One was specific for the mec gene; the other was specific for transposon Tn554. The findings suggest that the MRSA isolates studied were representative of two genetically distinct MRSA ""clones,"" each with a unique strain-specific methicillin-resistant phenotype that is stable under the conditions of invasive disease, carriage, and spread from patient to patient."

We aimed to discuss the clinical characteristics and management of the H1N1 influenza infection in very young infants. Clinical characteristics of ten infants diagnosed with H1N1 influenza virus infection during the 2009 outbreak season in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit were evaluated. The diagnosis was confirmed by testing of respiratory samples with pandemic H1N1 influenza specific real-time PCR assay. Of the 46 patients with fever or respiratory problems, ten (22%) were diagnosed with H1N1 influenza virus infection during the 2009 (October-December) peak outbreak season. All infants including the preterms were admitted from home, seven (70%) were full-term and three (30%) were preterm. Median age of the patients at admission was 24.5 days. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms. Apnea was the initial symptoms in three patients. Two patients required oxygen support, one of which, a preterm baby, had been mechanically ventilated for 2 days. Mean duration of hospitalization was 7.8 ± 4.9 days. Chest radiography revealed radio-opacities on both lung fields in six patients. In addition, two patients had co-infection. All patients with proven infection were given oseltamivir medication. Recovery was achieved in all patients with no residual deficits or side effects from the antiviral oseltamivir treatment. The H1N1 influenza virus infection in very young infants appears to be mild to moderate in severity. The outcomes of the infants may be influenced by antiviral therapy. Treatment with antiviral oseltamivir appears to have no major adverse effects."

CD011926,0,9757943,0,Interleukin 2 receptor regulation and IL-2 function in the human infant.,"IL-2 receptor is expressed at low levels on adult blood lymphocytes, and at lower levels on cord blood cells. IL-2 receptor alpha and beta chain expression increases gradually from 0-18 months of age. The level of soluble CD25 (IL-2 receptor alpha chain) has been reported to be elevated in cord blood. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that adult cells express 10 times as much CD25 mRNA as cord cells. Cord plasma showed only a marginal ability to strip CD25 from the membrane. To assess the functional consequences of low IL-2 receptor expression, cord and adult cells were activated in vitro. The response was stimulus-dependent, but cord cells upregulated CD25 readily. Cord and adult cells proliferated in an IL-2-dependent assay to a similar extent. Infants suffering acute infection showed marginally higher levels of membrane CD25 expression than infants without overt infection. Thus neonatal and infant lymphocytes express lower levels of IL-2 receptors than adult cells, reflecting lower mRNA concentrations at least for CD25; they are able to up-regulate receptors in response to in vitro stimulation and are able to respond in vitro to IL-2-dependent stimulation; however in vivo there may be a dampening down of the IL-2 system in infancy."
CD011926,0,26513253,0,Characterization of Cronobacter spp. isolated from food of plant origin and environmental samples collected from farms and from supermarkets in the Czech Republic.,"The Cronobacter genus (previously known as Enterobacter sakazakii) comprises seven species (Cronobacter sakazakii, Cronobacter malonaticus, Cronobacter muytjensii, Cronobacter turicensis, Cronobacter dublinensis, Cronobacter universalis and Cronobacter condimenti)which cause serious infections in neonates and immunocompromised people.Most of the documented outbreaks of these bacteria have been associated with consumption of contaminated powdered infant formula. The plant environment is considered to be the natural habitat of these bacteria. Therefore, a total number of 563 samples of vegetables, fruit, water and environmental swabs were collected from local farms and supermarkets in the Czech Republic and investigated for the presence of Cronobacter spp. The obtained 45 isolates (8.0%) were further characterized by phenotyping (antimicrobial resistance, capsule and pigment production) and genotyping (fusA sequencing,MLST, PCR-serotyping) methods. Most of the Cronobacter isolates (42.2%) were identified as C. sakazakii, followed by C. turicensis (31.1%), C. dublinensis (22.2%), C. malonaticus (2.2%) and C. universalis (2.2%). The 25 identified sequence types, out of which 17 were unique for only one strain, indicated a high diversity of strains. C. sakazakii sequence type 4 (ST 4), which has been associated with many cases of meningitis, was isolated only in one case. A strong association of C. turicensis and C. dublinensis with the plant environment can be deduced from our results."

Samples of peripheral blood were obtained from the women during pregnancy and at delivery, at which time a small piece of placental tissue was obtained from a random site and immediately placed into fixative. Blood samples were obtained from infants at or shortly after birth and thereafter at approximately 3-month intervals, until the age of 18 months, in order to determine their HIV infection status. HIV RNA and p24 antigen were quantified in maternal plasma and CD4 cells enumerated. Paediatric diagnosis was conducted using polymerase chain reaction, virus isolation, detection of p24 antigen, and measurement of class-specific antibodies. Placental damage was quantified and evaluated using transmission electron microscopy. Maternal viral load was low, with a mean RNA copy number of 8,237 per millilitre of plasma (range 230-37,233 copies/ml). Only two women were p24-antigenaemic, and CD4 numbers ranged from 0.09 to 2.8 x 10(9)/l. There was evidence of breaks in the trophoblastic surface to the depth of the basement membrane in all 17 placentas, and perivillous fibrinoid deposits were also observed to a varying degree in all samples. However, none of the 13 infants available for follow-up had evidence of infection with HIV. Superficial damage to the trophoblastic surface of the placenta, with exposure of the basement membrane and potential exposure of CD4-expressing cells, does not appear to be a significant factor in the transmission of HIV from mother to infant during pregnancy."

All patients undergoing HSCT (125 allogeneic, 50 autologous) from January 1994 to December 2004 were included. Nine underwent a second transplant for graft failure or disease recurrence. Of 134 allogeneic transplants performed, 62 were unrelated. Shell vial cultures of throat swabs and urine, and blood samples for pp65 antigenemia +/- PCR were tested weekly for a mean of 147 days post transplant. CMV negative blood products and filters were used in all. 11 rec+/donor-, 12rec-/donor+ and 10rec+/donor+ transplants were performed. All received prophylactic acyclovir, IVIG was prescribed for all but CMV -/- transplants. Initial detection of CMV was urine in 5 cases, four of whom developed antigenemia. Of ten patients who developed antigenemia, nine were treated with ganciclovir +/- foscarnet and two of these patients developed CMV pneumonitis and died. The current policy of strict surveillance, matching donor and recipient CMV status, use of CMV negative blood products and filters and pre-emptive therapy appears to be effective in controlling CMV disease/infection in the peritransplant period."

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference broth microdilution method. BanI digestion patterns of the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were used to identify C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C. orthopsilosis, and C. metapsilosis. A total of 138 C. parapsilosis isolates were stored (January 2007-December 2008). The overall frequency of C. parapsilosis complex in IFIs was 22%. Of the 138 tested isolates, 95% were C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, 3.6% were C. orthopsilosis, and 1.4% were C. metapsilosis. The MIC(50) values (expressed as μg/ml) for anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin for C. parapsilosis complex were 2, 1, and 2, respectively, and the MIC(90) values were 4, 2, and 4, respectively. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for itraconazole and posaconazole were 0.12 and 0.25, respectively, and for fluconazole, they were 1 and 4, respectively. This study, the most comprehensive study conducted to date to evaluate the frequency and antifungal susceptibility profiles of C. parapsilosis complex isolates from critically ill patients in Italy, highlights the low prevalence of C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis in IFIs."
CD011926,0,10074904,0,Concordant induction of cyclin E and p21cip1 in differentiated keratinocytes by the human papillomavirus E7 protein inhibits cellular and viral DNA synthesis.,"Productive infections by human papillomaviruses (HPVs) occur only in differentiated keratinocytes in squamous epithelia in which the HPV E7 protein reactivates the host DNA replication machinery to support viral DNA replication. In a fraction of the differentiated keratinocytes, E7 also posttranscriptionally induces p21Cip1, which is distributed in a mutually exclusive manner with unscheduled cellular DNA synthesis. In this study, double immunofluorescence labeling unexpectedly revealed that E7 caused a concordant accumulation of both cyclin E and p21Cip1 to high levels in patient papillomas and in organotypic cultures of primary human keratinocytes. The induction of cyclin E is mutually exclusive with unscheduled cellular DNA synthesis or abundant viral DNA. These novel virus-host interactions in differentiated keratinocytes are in contrast to previous observations made in submerged proliferating cultures, in which HPV E7 induces cyclin E and overcomes p21Cip1 inhibition of S-phase entry. We propose that an appropriately timed induction of cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 by HPV E7 in postmitotic cells enables S-phase reentry and HPV DNA amplification, whereas prematurely induced cyclin E stabilizes p21Cip1 protein, which then inhibits cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2. Consequently, cyclin E and p21Cip1 both fail to turn over, and DNA synthesis does not occur."
CD011926,0,8860356,0,The clinical relevance of different laboratory tests in CMV diagnosis.,"The array of diagnostic tools now available allows not only precise serological determination of past exposure to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections but also identification of CMV components in blood during viraemia--predictive of CMV disease. Sensitive and rapid identification of CMV components from infected organs from biopsies and body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, is also possible. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool that now also can he applied in a quantitative or semiquantitative manner. Non-PCR methods, which amplify the signal rather than DNA itself, are also available as quantitative tests. The antigenaemia assay was the first quantitative measure of CMV load during viraemia. It is useful in the surveillance of CMV in transplant patients as well as for drug efficacy monitoring, and is the method of choice in many laboratories. The use of modern diagnostic tools and subsequent treatment with an appropriate antiviral drug should reduce the number of lethal CMV cases to a minimum."
CD011926,0,16359196,0,Group A Streptococci from carriage and disease in Portugal: evolution of antimicrobial resistance and T antigenic types during 2000-2002.,"In this study, we analyzed the antimicrobial resistance properties and T antigenic types of 511 isolates collected in Lisbon district, Portugal, from throat swabs of healthy subjects (n=341), during 2000-2002 and from diverse infection sites (n=170) of outpatients and inpatients, during 1999-2002. Erythromycin resistance was higher in tonsillitis/pharyngitis (27.4%) and skin infection isolates (21.1%), than in carriage and invasive isolates (<or=10%). Differences in erythromycin resistance among children and adults were noticed only for carriage isolates (9.3% in children and 21.1% in adults). Most erythromycin-resistant isolates from carriage (82.4%) and tonsillitis/pharyngitis (71.9%) showed the M phenotype. All M phenotype isolates (n=53) carried mef(A), whereas all MLS(B) phenotype isolates (n=19) carried erm(B) and not erm(A). Resistance to tetracycline [mediated by tet(M) in most isolates] was <or=6% in tonsillitis/pharyngitis and carriage isolates, 36.8% in skin infection isolates, and 44.1% in invasive isolates. The M phenotype increased since 2000, linked to a decrease of tetracycline resistance, and was predominantly associated with T1 in 2000-2001 and T12 in 2002 among carriage isolates, and with T8/25/Imp19 through 2000-2002 among tonsillitis/pharyngitis isolates. The majority (53%) of the tetracycline-resistant invasive isolates were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin and chloramphenicol. This study showed that tetracycline and macrolide resistance frequency and phenotypes differ among GAS from various origins and changed over time. Moreover, T typing suggested that most drug-resistant isolates causing oropharyngeal carriage are distinct from the majority of isolates causing noninvasive and invasive infection."

CD011926,0,21827433,0,Overview of the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recognized as the most common congenital viral infection in humans and an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts. This recognition of the clinical importance of invasive CMV disease in the setting of immunodeficiency and in children with congenital CMV infection has led to the development of new diagnostic procedures for the rapid identification of CMV. Diagnosis of acute maternal CMV infection by the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig)M and low-avidity IgG requires confirmation of fetal infection, which is typically performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for CMV on amniotic fluid. Viral culture of the urine and saliva obtained within the first two weeks of life continues to be the gold standard for diagnosis of congenitally-infected infants. PCR assays of dried blood spots from newborns have been shown to lack sufficient sensitivity for the identification of most neonates with congenital CMV infection for universal screening purposes. However, saliva PCR assays are currently being assessed as a useful screening method for congenital CMV infection. In the immunocompromised host, newer rapid diagnostic assays, such as phosphoprotein 65 antigenemia and CMV real-time PCR of blood or plasma have allowed for preemptive treatment, reducing morbidity and mortality. However, lack of standardized real-time PCR protocols hinders the comparison of data from different centers and the development of uniform guidelines for the management of invasive CMV infections in immunocompromised individuals."

CD011926,0,21165718,0,Study of viral infections in infants with biliary atresia.,"Viral infections may have an important role in the pathogenesis of biliary atresia, and related clinical outcomes. In this research for determination of the possible role of HBV, HCV, HCMV, adenovirus, and BK virus infections in biliary atresia related clinical complications, the molecular and antigenic prevalence of these viral agents were studied. In this retrospective study, 34 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsy and autopsy liver tissue samples of neonates with biliary atresia were evaluated. The molecular prevalence of these viral infections was assayed by different PCR and RT-PCR methods. The antigenic prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HCMV infections was also studied in these liver tissue samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. HBV, HCV, and adenovirus genomes were detected in 9%, 6%, and 6% of liver autopsy and biopsy tissues of infants with biliary atresia, respectively. HBV and HCV co-infection was confirmed in 6% of FFPE samples. The genome of other investigated viruses was not detected in FFPE liver tissues. Detection of viral infection in FFPE liver tissue samples of newborns with biliary atresia, suggests the need for complete studies for the determination of accurate role of these viral infections in pathogenesis of biliary atresia."
CD011926,0,19846648,0,Clinical application of real-time PCR to screening critically ill and emergency-care surgical patients for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a quantitative analytical study.,"The clinical utility of real-time PCR screening assays for methicillin (methicillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization is constrained by the predictive values of their results: as MRSA prevalence falls, the assay's positive predictive value (PPV) drops, and a rising proportion of positive PCR assays will not be confirmed by culture. We provide a quantitative analysis of universal PCR screening of critical care and emergency surgical patients using the BD GeneOhm MRSA PCR system, involving 3,294 assays over six months. A total of 248 PCR assays (7.7%) were positive; however, 88 failed to be confirmed by culture, giving a PPV of 65%. Multivariate analysis was performed to compare PCR-positive culture-positive (P+C+) and PCR-positive culture-negative (P+C-) assays. P+C- results were positively associated with a history of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection or colonization (odds ratio [OR], 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32 to 7.54) and high PCR thresholds of signal intensity, indicative of a low concentration of target DNA (OR, 1.19 per cycle; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.26). P+C- results were negatively associated with a history of MRSA infection or colonization (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.42) and male sex (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.81). P+C+ patients were significantly more likely to have subsequent positive MRSA culture assays and microbiological evidence of clinical MRSA infection. The risk of subsequent MRSA infection in P+C- patients was not significantly different from that in case-matched PCR-negative controls. We conclude that, given the low PPV and poor correlation between a PCR-positive assay and the clinical outcome, it would be prudent to await culture confirmation before altering infection control measures on the basis of a positive PCR result."
CD011926,0,24304149,0,Comparison of peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization assays with culture-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry for the identification of bacteria and yeasts from blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid cultures.,"Peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA FISH) is a molecular diagnostic tool for the rapid detection of pathogens directly from liquid media. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate PNA FISH assays in comparison with culture-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) identification, as a reference method, for both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, during a 1-year investigation. On the basis of the Gram stain microscopy results, four different PNA FISH commercially available assays were used ('Staphylococcus aureus/CNS', 'Enterococcus faecalis/OE', 'GNR Traffic Light' and 'Yeasts Traffic Light' PNA FISH assays, AdvanDx). The four PNA FISH assays were applied to 956 positive blood cultures (921 for bacteria and 35 for yeasts) and 11 CSF cultures. Among the 921 blood samples positive for bacteria, PNA FISH gave concordant results with MALDI-TOF MS in 908/921 (98.64%) samples, showing an agreement of 99.4% in the case of monomicrobial infections. As regards yeasts, the PNA FISH assay showed a 100% agreement with the result obtained by MALDI-TOF MS. When PNA FISH assays were tested on the 11 CSF cultures, the results agreed with the reference method in all cases (100%). PNA FISH assays provided species identification at least one work-day before the MALDI-TOF MS culture-based identification. PNA FISH assays showed an excellent efficacy in the prompt identification of main pathogens, yielding a significant reduction in reporting time and leading to more appropriate patient management and therapy in cases of sepsis and severe infections."

A total of 474 HIV-uninfected and 69 HIV-infected children were followed until age of 12 months. Maternal predictors were measured during pregnancy and child predictors at birth and throughout the follow up. Child CD4 T-cell counts were evaluated at the age of 3 months and subsequent 3-month intervals; they decreased linearly among HIV-infected (beta = -8 cells per week; 95% CI -12 to -4; P = 0.0003) and increased linearly among HIV-uninfected children (beta = 4 cells/week; 95% CI 2-7; P = 0.0008). Decreased child counts were predicted by low child anthropometry, maternal HIV stage > or =2, and maternal mid-upper arm circumference <27 cm among HIV-infected children; and by weight-for-height <-2 z-score, maternal HIV stage > or =2, maternal erythrocyte sedimentation rate <81 mm/h and maternal haemoglobin <8.5 g/dl among HIV-uninfected children.

CD011926,0,25180849,0,Multidisciplinary approach to congenital Toxoplasma infection: an Italian nationwide survey.,"Italy provides a free voluntary serological screening for toxoplasmosis in pregnancy supported by public health system, as there is an estimated congenital toxoplasmosis rate of 1-2/10,000. The aim of this study was to make an inventory of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols in use in Italy in the absence of a national guideline. A semistructured questionnaire was distributed to AMCLI (Italian Association of Clinical Microbiologists) members who were asked to involve other specialists to fill in the form. Data from 26 centers show: a) a general use of the IgG avidity test to solve diagnosis in IgG/IgM positive, pregnant women; b) a widespread attitude to spyramicin antenatal treatment in suspected, unconfirmed maternal infection; c) avoidance of invasive antenatal diagnosis only in suspected early or late (>24 weeks), even confirmed, maternal infection d) fetal diagnosis performed by PCR assays on amniotic fluid; e) variability of both indications and dosage of pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine (P-S) as fetal treatment; f) use of comparative mother and newborn IgG/IgM Immuneblot in most centers; g) no diagnostic tests performed on placenta and cord blood; h) spyramicin is no longer used in congenital infections; i) no P-S-based treatment for children at high risk of congenital infection (late maternal infection) in the absence of diagnosis. As there is the opportunity to test pregnant women for Toxoplasma gondii infection in Italy free of charge, standardized diagnostic and therapeutic national guidelines would focus on a more uniform approach."

Chlamydia infections were detected in conjunctival smears. Chlamydia trachomatis was confirmed in 20 (15.3%) using ligase chain reaction and C. pneumoniae in 16 (12.3%) children using an indirect immunofluorescent method. Direct captures of chlamydial infections of newborns were included in the study. The authors had also examined 671 newborns in a maternity hospital from January 2002 till May 2003. Conjunctival scraping had been done in 29 (4.3%) cases mainly for mucopurulent conjunctivitis. Chlamydial conjunctivitis was identified only in 4 (0.6%) cases, i.e. C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae in 2 cases each. Initial clinical symptoms of both types of chlamydial conjunctivitis were similar (mucous discharge with various degrees of eyelid effusion and chemosis mainly on the tarsal conjunctiva). Clinical symptoms of the C. pneumoniae infection were later accompanied by pseudofollicular changes on the tarsal conjunctiva. The complication of this infection was lacrimal obstruction among half of newborns. Clarithromycin in syrup at a dose of 15 mg/kg/per day for 14 days ensured effective treatment of both chlamydial infections. Control scrapings were always negative and simultaneously the pathological conjunctival finding disappeared."

A micromethod for the efficient isolation of mononuclear cells from small volumes of blood, and definitions of PCR positivity that took into account the number and purity of these mononuclear cells, were established in an attempt to define parameters for quality assurance. Results of HIV culture, p-24 antigen, and HIV-specific IgA obtained on the same specimens were compared to PCR results. PCR had a specificity of 100% among 83 specimens from 50 babies known to be uninfected. Sensitivity among 26 HIV-infected infants older than 3 months was 98% (44 of 45 specimens); the one negative specimen, which had also been culture negative, gave a positive PCR result on the remaining aliquot when tested after decoding. Among infected infants less than 3 months old, which is an age when diagnosis by other assays is most problematic, PCR identified 10 of 10 patients (10 of 11 specimens) including two younger than one month. Viral culture showed the best concordance with PCR; however, in three infants, positive PCR results were observed several months before positive results were observed by viral culture."

CD011926,0,16539033,0,"Early diagnosis of congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection using PCR, hemoculture, and capillary concentration, as compared with delayed serology.","Congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection is a highly pathogenic and underreported condition. Early recognition is essential for effective treatment. Umbilical chord blood from newborns (n = 302) to infected mothers was analyzed with microhematocrit, hemoculture, and PCR methods. Each subject was then followed serologically. In calibrated suspensions of T. cruzi in blood, the sensitivity of PCR was 27-fold higher than hemoculture. However, this advantage was not reflected during routine testing of samples from maternities, partly because of the uneven distribution of few parasites in small samples. Levels of detection of congenital infection were 2.9% (8/272) for microhematocrit, 6.3% (18/287) for hemoculture, 6.4% (15/235) for PCR, and 8.9% (27/302) for cumulated results. Evaluation against the standard of delayed serology indicates that the regular application of PCR, hemoculture, and microhematocrit to blood samples allows the rapid detection of about 90% of the congenitally infected newborns, in samples that can be obtained before the mother and child leave the maternity ward."

CD011926,0,8525062,0,Comparison of arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and cell envelope protein electrophoresis for analysis of Acinetobacter baumannii and A. junii outbreaks.,"Two successive Acinetobacter outbreaks in a neonatal intensive care unit were studied with arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR), cell envelope protein electrophoresis (protein fingerprinting) and antibiotic susceptibility testing. AP-PCR fingerprinting and protein fingerprinting yielded identical clustering of the isolates studied. Susceptibility test results were useful for rapid recognition of the outbreaks, but clustering of several isolates was different from the clustering obtained with AP-PCR fingerprinting and protein fingerprinting. Typing results indicated that the two outbreaks, which occurred at a three-month interval, were each caused by a single strain, and that both strains differed from the strains prevailing in the hospital. The strain of one outbreak was identified as A. junii, a species commonly not involved in outbreaks. A. baumannii isolates collected from different departments of this hospital during a period of four years clustered into only five different types. Moreover, strains from different departments of a second hospital belonged to the type prevailing in the first hospital, although there were no apparent connections between the two institutions. This may indicate that only a limited number of strains of the A. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex are involved in nosocomial outbreaks."
CD011926,0,12518843,0,Malaria infections are randomly distributed in diverse holoendemic areas of Papua New Guinea.,"Malaria is holoendemic in the lowlands of Papua New Guinea (PNG), and interactions among Plasmodium species may influence prevalence of mixed infections. Previously, field samples from a cross-sectional survey in Dreikikir, East Sepik Province, analyzed by blood smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), showed that mixed infections were common and randomly distributed in this malaria endemic region. To evaluate further whether Plasmodium species distribution is random, blood smear- and PCR/sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization-based analyses of cross-sectional survey samples were conducted in 2 additional malaria holoendemic regions of northern PNG. Despite ecologic, species prevalence, and transmission season differences in these new surveys, all 4 Plasmodium species were found to be randomly distributed in each area; random distribution patterns also were observed when study populations were divided into age groups. These findings provide consistent evidence that Plasmodium species infections occur independently of one another in PNG malaria holoendemic sites. This independent occurrence suggests that age-dependent, acquired malaria immunity has limited influence on the distribution pattern of Plasmodium species infections in endemic human populations; infection by 1 human malaria parasite species does not reduce susceptibility to infection by others; and malaria vaccines would exhibit limited protection against blood-stage infection by heterologous Plasmodium species."

In all children RSV neutralizing antibodies were demonstrated at birth, with titers ranging from 33 to 1382. The calculated mean half life of these antibodies was 26 days. Furthermore, in a group of 38 children with suspected RSV infection, all younger than 6 months of age on admission, the diagnostic value of serological assays was evaluated. In 32 children RSV infection was confirmed by virus isolation, direct immune fluorescence and RT-PCR. In 7 patients of this group a significant titer rise in virus neutralization assay was demonstrated. Six additional RSV infected children could be identified by showing the presence of RSV-specific IgM or IgA serum antibodies or by showing an increase in fusion protein or glycoprotein specific antibodies. All serological tests together identified 13 (41%) of the 32 RSV infected patients. It is concluded that in children of this age group, which represent the majority of patients hospitalized with RSV infections, serological assays not only have a limited diagnostic value but are of limited value for sero-epidemiological studies."

Both isolates have features typical of serogroup Y N. meningitidis: are of serotype 2c, are of the multi-locus sequence types typical of the serogroup Y strains in Canada, and are genotyped as serogroup Y based on a previously described PCR-ELISA method that detects the serogroup-Y-specific siaD gene. However, both strains were poly-agglutinable in both anti-Y and anti-W135 antisera. Further studies on 1 of these 2 isolates showed the presence of glucose and galactose as well as sialic acids in its purified capsular polysaccharide, suggesting the presence of both serogroup Y and serogroup W135 polysaccharides. Rabbit antisera produced to this strain contained antibodies to both purified serogroup Y and serogroup W135 capsular polysaccharides. Absorption experiments with either serogroup Y or serogroup W135 bacteria confirmed the presence of antibodies to these 2 different polysaccharides. DNA sequencing of the cps operon from both isolates revealed a siaD gene with 99.7% homology to the published siaD sequence from a serogroup Y strain but with 3 point mutations that all resulted in amino acid changes. How these strains may affect results of routine surveillance, PCR diagnosis, and immuno-protection by vaccination are discussed."
CD011926,0,25341609,0,Bronchiolitis obliterans caused by CMV in a previously healthy Asian infant.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is currently the most common cause of congenital infection and the leading infectious cause of brain damage and hearing loss in children. Perinatal CMV infection rarely causes clinical manifestations in normal individuals and usually follows a benign course in immunocompetent infants. However, ~15-25% of infected preterm infants may develop pneumonia, hepatitis or sepsis-like illness, bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, distended bowel, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a rare, fibrosing form of chronic obstructive lung disease that follows severe insults to the lower respiratory tract and results in narrowing and/or complete obliteration of the small airways. In non-transplant children, the most common form of BO is a severe lower respiratory tract infection, especially of adenovirus. We experienced a case of a 37-day-old male who was diagnosed as BO on chest computed tomography (CT) after CMV pneumonia. To our best knowledge, this is the first case of BO caused by CMV pneumonia in a healthy infant."

In the evaluation tests with recombinant virus-like particles, the BLEIA demonstrated broad reactivity against several NV genotypes (genotypes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 12 in genogroup I [GI] and genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, and 13 in GII), a wide dose-response range from 0.25 pg/ml to 10,000 pg/ml, and good reproducibility with low coefficients of variation (CVs) (within-run CVs of <2.8%, between-day CVs of <3.7%). In the evaluation tests with NV-positive fecal samples, a good correlation (y = 0.66x - 3.21, r = 0.84) between the BLEIA and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was obtained. Furthermore, in the dilution test with NV specimens, the analytical sensitivity of NV was estimated to be 10(5) to 10(6) copies/g of fecal sample, indicating that the analytical sensitivity of the BLEIA is comparable to that of commercially available molecular methods. All assay steps are fully automated, the turnaround time is 46 min, and the throughput of the assay is 120 tests/h. These results indicate that the BLEIA is potentially useful for the rapid diagnosis of NV in epidemic and sporadic gastroenteritis."

The lack of conclusive knowledge regarding the pathogenic potential of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. in many conditions is due to a general unfamiliarity of physicians and microbiology laboratories with their fastidious growth requirements, leading to difficulty in their detection; their high prevalence in healthy persons; the poor design of research studies attempting to base association with disease on the mere presence of the organisms in the lower urogenital tract; the failure to consider multifactorial aspects of diseases; and considering these genital mycoplasmas only as a last resort. The situation is now changing because of a greater appreciation of the genital mycoplasmas as perinatal pathogens and improvements in laboratory detection, particularly with regard to the development of powerful molecular nucleic acid amplification tests.

CD011926,0,11376033,0,Development and evaluation of detection systems for staphylococcal exfoliative toxin A responsible for scalded-skin syndrome.,"Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome is usually diagnosed clinically by its characteristic exfoliating rash. Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from the patient further supports the diagnosis. Several detection systems have been developed to determine whether the isolated strain produces exfoliative toxin, but none are routinely available in hospital laboratories. In a novel approach, we used computer models to predict the structure of the exfoliative toxins based on other serine proteases and to identify surface epitopes for the production of antibodies that specifically bound the exfoliative toxin A (ETA) serotype. Several rapid immunologically based diagnostic tests for ETA were developed with these antibodies and compared with existing systems. Our results showed that Western blot analysis using these antibodies was in complete correlation with PCR, which has been validated against the ""gold standard"" mouse model. On the other hand, the double-antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Ouchterlony immunodiffusion assay gave unacceptably high false-positive results due to interference by staphylococcal protein A. This problem was successfully overcome by the development of a F(ab')(2) fragment ELISA, which was rapid and reproducible and was as sensitive and specific as PCR and Western blot analysis. The F(ab')(2) fragment ELISA is superior to existing diagnostic systems because it is quantitative, which may be related to the severity of the condition, and can detect amounts of exfoliative toxin in the picogram range directly from serum. This is the first detection system with the potential to confirm the diagnosis of staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome from a routine blood test within 3 h of presentation."

CD011926,0,15802209,0,Life-threatening cutaneous viral diseases.,"Most viral infections present with a cutaneous eruption that in the greater majority of cases is self-healing. Only in rare instances is the eruption accompanied by constitutional symptoms, and even more rarely, irreversible damage may occur or death may ensue. As with other infectious diseases, prognosis depends on the status of immunologic surveillance. Immunodepressed patients are, therefore, at the greatest risk. It has become more evident, however, that even in immunocompetent patients, eruption that were considered not long ago as benign diseases may in fact result in complications and even death. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction assays has allowed us to attribute conditions to a specific viral infection, which in the past was not possible. Therefore, dermatologists may come across, directly or during consultation, patients presenting with skin lesions that may be related to a viral disease and may lead to possible severe systemic complications. Dermatologists, however, may not be prepared for such developments, and thus the goal of this article is to suggest some of the possibilities. Discussing all the viral diseases that may present with cutaneous manifestations would be cumbersome; thus this article will be limited to the diseases that may endanger the life of a patient who is seeking dermatologic advice and who does not seem to have, at first sight, severe systemic involvement."

Biological phenotyping of each HIV variant was accomplished by growth in MT-2, and macrophages from healthy and non-HIV-infected donors. Genetic characterization of the variants was accomplished by DNA sequence analysis. All the women enrolled in this study received ZDV therapy. Virus was cultured from eight out of ten env V3-PCR positive mothers. HIV-1 isolates were all non-syncitium inducing variants. None of the mothers were found to transmit HIV, as determined by DNA PCR and quantitative co-cultures on their infants which were seronegative for HIV-1 through one year after birth. Viral cultures from infant blood samples were negative and infants were all healthy. However, nested env V3-PCR detected proviral DNA in five out of ten infants. In contrast, conventional gag-PCR was negative in the same five infants. Sequences of the five maternal-infant pairs were different, suggesting unique infant HIV-1 variants. The three highest maternal viral load values corresponded to infants that were env V3-PCR positive. These results suggest that HIV-1 particles are transmitted from ZDV-treated mothers to infants. Infant follow up is recommended to determine if HIV-1 has been inhibited by the immune system of the infants."
CD011926,0,8051277,0,Detection of BK virus DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with respiratory infections but not in saliva from immunodeficient and immunocompetent adult patients.,"Our understanding of important stages in the pathogenesis of the human polyomavirus BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV) infections is limited. In this context, nasopharyngeal aspirates from 201 children with respiratory diseases and saliva from 60 human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected adults and 10 healthy adult controls were collected and analyzed for the presence of BKV and JCV DNA by PCR. Neither BKV nor JCV DNA was detected in the saliva specimens. We demonstrated BKV DNA, but no infectious BKV, in 2 of 201 nasopharyngeal aspirates. Each sample contained one unique rearranged noncoding control region variant of BKV. The results indicate that (i) BKV and JCV are not regularly associated with respiratory infections in children requiring hospitalization, (ii) nasopharyngeal cells are not an important site for primary replication of human polyomavirus BKV and JCV, and (iii) the salivary glands and oropharyngeal cells seem not to be involved in BKV and JCV persistence. We propose that for the polyomaviruses BKV and JCV the alimentary tract should be considered as a portal of entrance to the human organism."
CD011926,0,2845831,0,Virus-associated histiocytic proliferations in children. Frequent association with Epstein-Barr virus and congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies.,"Nineteen children who presented with fever, hepato-splenomegaly, bone marrow and/or hepatic failure, and biopsy evidence of histiocytic proliferations were evaluated for lymphocyte dysfunction and evidence of prior viral infection. Seventeen of the children had erythrophagocytosis consistent with the previously described virus-associated hemophagocytosis syndrome (VAHS) or Familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FEL). The other two had benign histiocytic proliferations in the central nervous system (CNS) with liver and bone marrow dysfunction. There were two sibling pairs and six patients with known disorders of immune deficiency. The remaining nine cases appeared to be sporadic and idiopathic. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) was identified in patients by serologic or DNA hybridization studies (15), EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (1), adenovirus plus EBV and CMV (1), or adenovirus and EBV (1). Herpes zoster was associated with reactivation of symptoms in one patient. Immunologic impairment was evidenced by lymphopenia in 10 of 19 patients. More extensive evaluations could be done at diagnosis on only some of the children because the histiocytic proliferative syndrome was not recognized or because there were insufficient numbers of lymphocytes in samples obtained. For those who could be evaluated, the following immune deficiencies were found: decreased lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens (4 of 9), absent or markedly decreased natural killer function (5 of 5), and decreased cytotoxic lymphocyte reactivity to allogenic EBV-infected target cells (3 of 3). A new finding reported here is a higher than expected prevalence of HLA types A30, B8, and A1/B8 among the patients tested."
CD011926,0,21679107,0,Implementation of HIV early infant diagnosis and HIV type 1 RNA viral load determination on dried blood spots in Cameroon: challenges and propositions.,"The testing of dried blood spots (DBSs) for human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA by PCR is a technology that has proven to be particularly valuable in diagnosing exposed infants. We implemented this technology for HIV-1 early infant diagnosis (EID) and HIV-1 RNA viral load determination in infants born of HIV-1-seropositive mothers from remote areas in Cameroon. The samples were collected between December 2007 and September 2010. Fourteen thousand seven hundred and sixty-three (14,763) DBS samples from infants born of HIV-positive mothers in 108 sites nationwide were tested for HIV. Of these, 1452 were positive on first PCR analyses (PCR1), giving an overall infection rate of 12.30%. We received only 475 DBS specimen for a second PCR testing (PCR2); out of these, 145 were positive. The median HIV-1 RNA viral load for 169 infant DBS samples tested was 6.85 log copies/ml, with values ranging from 3.37 to 8 log copies/ml. The determination of the viral load on the same DBS as that used for PCR1 allowed us to bypass the PCR2. The viral load values were high and tend to decrease with age but with a weak slope. The high values of viral load among these infants call for early and effective administration of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The findings from this study indicate that the use of DBS provides a powerful tool for perinatal screening programs, improvement on the testing algorithm, and follow-up during treatment, and thus should be scaled up to the entire nation."
CD011926,0,18327485,0,"Comparison of direct immunofluorescence, conventional cell culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques for detecting respiratory syncytial virus in nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants.","A total of 316 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate from infants up to two years of age with acute respiratory-tract illnesses were processed for detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using three different techniques: viral isolation, direct immunofluorescence, and PCR. Of the samples, 36 (11.4%) were positive for RSV, considering the three techniques. PCR was the most sensitive technique, providing positive findings in 35/316 (11.1%) of the samples, followed by direct immunofluorescence (25/316, 7.9%) and viral isolation (20/315, 6.3%) (p < 0.001). A sample was positive by immunofluorescence and negative by PCR, and 11 (31.4%) were positive only by RT-PCR. We conclude that RT-PCR is more sensitive than IF and viral isolation to detect RSV in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens in newborn and infants."

The prevalence of Providencia spp. in children with diarrhea in Japan is lower than that previously reported for Japanese travelers abroad with diarrhea."
CD011926,0,19926248,0,[Management of congenital toxoplasmosis in France: current data].,"Congenital toxoplasmosis is caused by transplacental contamination of the fetus withToxoplasma gondiifollowing maternal primary infection. The risk of mother-to-child transmission depends on the term of pregnancy at the time of maternal infection. The risk is lower than 5% in the first trimester but can reach 90% in the last days of pregnancy. Inversely, however, fetal disease is more severe when contamination occurs early in pregnancy. The French prevention program officially recommends monthly serological screening of susceptible women during pregnancy and information about hygiene and dietary rules. Prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis is based on a combination of examinations: PCR testing for the parasite in amniotic fluid, mouse inoculation, fetal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Neonatal screening consists of PCR of the placenta, mouse inoculation, detection of specific IgM and IgA in the newborn, ocular fundus examinations by indirect ophthalmoscopy, and transfontanellar ultrasonography. As soon as maternal infection is suspected, preventive treatment with spiramycin begins; the treatment is changed to a combination of pyrimethamine-sulfonamide if fetal infection is proved. Some teams are using this combination as first-line treatment after 30 weeks of gestation, without performing amniocentesis. Recent European multicenter studies raise questions about the effectiveness of prenatal treatment on mother-to-child transmission and on the reduction in the number and severity of fetal sequelae. A randomized controlled trial is required to prove the efficacy of prenatal treatment in general and of specific drugs, in particular. As soon as infection is confirmed, infected children are treated with the pyrimethamine-sulfonamide combination for 12 to 24 months. Recent multicenter studies show that postnatal treatment does not prevent ocular lesions: 5% of treated children had choroiditis lesions at birth, 20% at 5 years, and 30% at 8 years of age. Furthermore no consensus exists about the duration of postnatal treatment (3 months in Denmark versus 12 months in France). A multicenter randomized controlled trial is necessary to assess the efficacy of postnatal treatment and determine its duration. A surveillance system was set up in 2007 by the National Reference Center for Toxoplasmosis to determine the perinatal burden of this infection and to assess the national policy."
CD011926,0,26214095,0,Human saliva as route of inter-human infection for mouse mammary tumor virus.,"Etiology of human breast cancer is unknown, whereas the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) is recognized as the etiologic agent of mouse mammary carcinoma. Moreover, this experimental model contributed substantially to our understanding of many biological aspects of the human disease. Several data strongly suggest a causative role of MMTV in humans, such as the presence of viral sequences in a high percentage of infiltrating breast carcinoma and in its preinvasive lesions, the production of viral particles in primary cultures of breast cancer, the ability of the virus to infect cells in culture. This paper demonstrates that MMTV is present in human saliva and salivary glands. MMTV presence was investigated by fluorescent PCR, RT-PCR, FISH, immunohistochemistry, and whole transcriptome analysis. Saliva was obtained from newborns, children, adults, and breast cancer patients. The saliva of newborns is MMTV-free, whereas MMTV is present in saliva of children (26.66%), healthy adults (10.60%), and breast cancer patients (57.14% as DNA and 33.9% as RNA). MMTV is also present in 8.10% of salivary glands. RNA-seq analysis performed on saliva of a breast cancer patient demonstrates a high expression of MMTV RNA in comparison to negative controls. The possibility of a contamination by murine DNA was excluded by murine mtDNA and IAP LTR PCR. These findings confirm the presence of MMTV in humans, strongly suggest saliva as route in inter-human infection, and support the hypothesis of a viral origin for human breast carcinoma."
CD011926,0,19141741,0,"Group B streptococcus colonization of pregnant women and their children observed on obstetric and neonatal wards of the University Hospital in Krakow, Poland.","The study was arranged to assess the actual rates of colonization of pregnant women and their children with group B streptococcus (GBS) in a Polish university hospital. Resistance of these cocci to macrolides and clindamycin was also tested and routes of transmission of GBS were followed in some cases using molecular typing. Colonization with GBS was checked in 340 pregnant women living in the south-eastern region of Poland (Małopolska) in the years 2004-2006. Women with a complicated pregnancy were more often colonized than those with a normal pregnancy (20.0 % versus 17.2 %). Moreover, women with a complicated pregnancy were twice as often colonized with GBS strains with the MLS(B) phenotype indicating resistance to macrolides and clindamycin. Regarding neonatal colonization by GBS, we found that neonates born from the colonized mothers with a complicated pregnancy were more often colonized with GBS than those from the mothers with a normal pregnancy (35 % versus 26.7 %). By molecular typing of the GBS strains isolated from mothers and their newborns we have been able to suggest the possibility of horizontal transmission of the strains from the hospital environment to newborns. Our results clearly indicate that rates of GBS colonization among pregnant women and neonates in a Polish university hospital have reached levels comparable to those reported in other European clinical centres."

In breast milk, high viral loads observed as high viral DNA titers tended to coincide with higher LF levels. However, the LF levels did not correlate to virus transmission to preterm infants. The viral load in the transmitting group was highest compared to the nontransmitting group. We conclude that viral load in breast milk is an important factor for transmission of the virus."

Posttransplantation CMV infection, reported in 23% of 1221 CB recipients, was associated with patient pretransplantation CMV serology (P < .001), but not with CMV serology in CB donors or their mothers. A total of 26 988 infant CB donors were evaluated by viral culture of saliva. Subgroups were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction in CB (CB-PCR) in 2 case-control studies. In the first study, 33 of 47 saliva culture-positive CB donors were confirmed by CB-PCR. All mothers of the 33 infants with confirmed CMV infection were CMV-total antibody positive, but only 1 of 3 had CMV-IgM antibody. The second study evaluated infants born to mothers with CMV-IgM antibody. Of these, 5 of 170 saliva culture-negative infants were positive by CB-PCR. The incidence of congenital CMV infection in CB donors was low (0.12%). Maternal serology had poor predictive value for CMV infection in their infant CB donors and bore no detected relationship to CMV infection in CB recipients. Saliva culture for CMV had both false-positive and -negative results. CB-PCR was a useful alternative for detecting CMV in CB donors."

Most of them were diagnosed with serological tests--determination with ELISA test the anti-legionella antibodies in IgM fraction of serum gamma globulins, as the most recent reaction for Legionella infection. Only few cases were diagnosed by detection of legionella antigen in urine. All BAL specimens from several patients were negative when examined with culture method, but some were positive with PCR only. Two outbreaks were registered: one in a family (5 patients, 0 death) and one in hospital (4 patients, 3 death cases). Fifteen cases were connected with travel: 14 foreign travel cases, one in Poland.

CD011926,0,21411570,0,Comparison of the Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel with xTAG respiratory viral panel fast for diagnosis of respiratory virus infections.,"Nucleic acid tests are sensitive and specific and provide a rapid diagnosis, making them invaluable for patient and outbreak management. Multiplex PCR assays have additional advantages in providing an economical and comprehensive panel for many common respiratory viruses. Previous reports have shown the utility of the xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay manufactured by Luminex Molecular Diagnostics for this purpose. A newer generation of this kit, released in Canada in early 2010, is designed to simplify the procedure and reduce the turnaround time by about 24 h. The assay methodology and targets included in this version of the kit are different; consequently, the objective of this study was to compare the detection of a panel of respiratory viral targets using the older Luminex xTAG RVP (RVP Classic) assay with that using the newer xTAG RVP Fast assay. This study included 334 respiratory specimens that had been characterized for a variety of respiratory viral targets; all samples were tested by both versions of the RVP assay in parallel. Overall, the RVP Classic assay was more sensitive than the RVP Fast assay (88.6% and 77.5% sensitivities, respectively) for all the viral targets combined. Targets not detected by the RVP Fast assay included primarily influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus type 2, and human coronavirus 229E. A small number of samples positive for influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus B, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 1 were not detected by the RVP Classic assay and in general had low viral loads."
CD011926,0,7751370,0,Direct detection of proviral gag segment of human immunodeficiency virus in peripheral blood lymphocytes by colorimetric PCR assay as a clinical laboratory tool applied to different at-risk populations.,"We used a colorimetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay in kit form to detect directly human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral gag sequences in peripheral blood cells from 68 healthy blood donors, 51 subjects at risk for HIV infection, 122 patients with HIV-1 infection, 11 patients with indeterminate Western blot (immunoblot) results, 4 blood donors HIV-1 positive by enzyme immunoassay, and 13 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers. The results obtained in the blood donors and HIV-1-infected patients demonstrated the high degree of diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the PCR method. HIV-1 infection was excluded in 10 of the 11 patients with indeterminate Western blot results and in all four enzyme immunoassay-positive blood donors. A diagnosis of HIV infection was ruled out by negative PCR results in 5 of 13 children from seropositive mothers, which excluded vertical transmission of the infection in these cases; these children were younger than 3 months and had positive serological results. Two at-risk patients with negative serological results had positive PCR results. All results were confirmed by conventional PCR. In conclusion, colorimetric PCR, which is commercially available in kit form, is an easy and reliable technique that can be used to detect proviral HIV-1 genomes in blood cells, and despite the limitations owing to HIV genome variability, it is useful in the clinical setting for the diagnosis of HIV infection in selected categories of patients."

The assay had a lower limit of detection of 2 log(10) viral copies/mL and displayed linearity over 5 log(10) viral copies, with a lower limit of quantitation of 4 log(10) viral copies/mL. Mean viral loads (95% confidence interval) for hospitalized children, university students, and institutionalized elderly, were 7.08 log(10) viral copies/mL (6.7-7.5), 6.87 log(10) viral copies/mL (6.5-7.2), and 7.09 log(10) viral copies/mL (6.9-7.3), respectively (P = 0.67). Serial specimens of 14 university students showed a decrease of mean viral loads from 6.36 log(10) viral copies/mL on day 1 to 2.32 log(10) viral copies/mL 7 days past symptom onset (P < 0.001). Using an HRV qPCR, we showed that viral loads did not differ between the community and hospitalized populations and significantly decreased following symptoms onset in healthy individuals."

The PCR was carried out using the established primers (NG059, NG061, NG063) to amplify TTV DNA sequences. The sequences were detected in 6 of the 20 patients (30.0%) with liver disease and in 5 of the 35 healthy children (14.2%) by direct gel analysis. There was no significant difference between the prevalence of liver disease patients and controls. However, both patients with fulminant hepatitis and both patients with chronic hepatitis had TTV DNA sequences. Four of the six TTV isolates from liver disease patients were genotype 1a, whereas only one of the five TTV isolates from controls was genotype 1a. Although the study population was small, it is possible that genotype 1a of TTV might be more pathogenic than other genotypes in children."

Children between 2 and 5-10 years of age are not infected (depending of the vaccine used and the vaccine calendar) because they were vaccinated in their infancy. However, adolescents and adults are becoming susceptible because they do not receive any vaccinal or natural boosters. They can be infected and contaminated infants are too young to be vaccinated. Clinical symptoms in adolescents and adults, previously vaccinated or infected, are very variable and for this reason biological diagnosis are now necessary to confirm the infection. These diagnostics are culture, PCR and serology."

CD011926,0,16897958,0,[Prenatal diagnostics of Toxoplasma gondii invasion by quantitative method of PCR-TaqMann].,"Routine serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis provides high sensitivity, but not high specificity. The high sensivity combined with high specifity offered by PCR-TaqMann as well as the degree of infection led us to investigate the presence and levels of T. gondii DNA in amniotic fluid, maternal and neonatal blood in cases of pregnancy where infection with this agent was suspected. Samples of amniotic fluid and blood were taken from pregnant women. Postnatal blood samples were also taken from their infants. Presence and levels of toxoplasma DNA was investigated using PCR-TaqMann. PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. The PCR-TaqMann test is highly sensitive, specific and useful method allowing detection of the parasite genome and assessement of its level."
CD011926,0,12844418,0,[ABO blood group typing for infants and its application for clinical transfusion].,"To study the correct method for determining ABO blood types in infants and its influencing factors, blood types of 33 infants under 6 months old were determined by routine serological method, micro-column gel typing system and PCR-SSP genotyping method. Of the 33 cases with discrepant results of ABO blood type by different methods, the blood types of 32 cases were discrepant between red cell and serological typings in the routine serological method, and a false coincidence in 1 case was caused by bacterial infection resulting in B-like antigen. Correct blood typing was obtained in 27 cases with a correct rate of 84.4% (27/32) by using micro-column gel typing system. PCR-SSP method gave correct results in all of 33 cases. There was a significant difference between the results of micro-column gel typing system and PCR-SSP. It is concluded that to determine ABO blood type for infants < 6 months old, it is recommended to adopt micro-column gel typing system method, and what must be taken into account is the possible false coincidence caused by bacterial infection resulting in B-like antigen. In micro-column gel typing system, if the results of red cell and serological typing are identical, the principle is that blood transfusion must be performed with same ABO blood type between recipient and donor. If not, washed O red blood cells should be used for infants, and then change to transfusion with identical blood group according to PCR-SSP typing results."

The results showed that rotavirus is associated with 65.6% (889/1355) of diarrheal admissions. Rotavirus infection mostly affected children under 2 years of age with a peak incidence in children 1 to 2 years of age (75.7%) and it occurs year round with a slight seasonal pattern; 99.5% of the specimens could be G-typed: G1 was predominant (68.7%), followed by G4 (15.4%), G2 (12.3%), G3 (0.6%), and G9 (0.5%). High identities of VP7 nucleotide (96.3 to 96.9%) and deduced amino acid (98.1 to 98.4%) were found between two Vietnamese G9 strains and also the recent emergence of G9 strains US 1205, Brazilian R143, and Malawian MW69. Mixed infections were identified in 17 (2.0%), and 5 strains (0.5%) remained untypable. The four most common worldwide strains, G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G4P[8], constituted 81.1% of all rotaviruses typed with G1P[8] being the most prevalent type (58.2%). Unusual G/P combinations (11 strains) were detected in 11.7% of all strains, of which, G1P[4] was the most prevalent, accounting for 5.6% of the total. Several combinations of G and P types were observed in this study, suggesting a complex rotavirus infection pattern in Vietnam. This study has provided for the first time clear indication on the circulating G and P genotypes among hospitalized children in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The results suggest that these viral infections are prevalent among hospitalized children and that the four most common worldwide G types as well as the four most common G-P combinations were also infecting children in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This result could have important implications for rotavirus vaccine programs and for understanding the epidemiological characteristics of human rotavirus in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."
CD011926,0,7931187,0,Sequence similarity of human caliciviruses and small round structured viruses.,"The application of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers directed to the RNA dependent RNA polymerase region within ORF1 of Norwalk virus (NV) showed that 31 percent of morphologically typical human caliciviruses (HuCV) and 57% of small round structured viruses (SRSVs) produced a product of 470 bp similar to the NV control, NV 8FIIa/68/US. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of morphologically typical HuCVs with previously published sequences for SRSVs, NV, and Snow Mountain agent (SMA) showed a high degree of homology (90-92%) with SMA and a lesser extent of homology with NV (60-61%). The amino acid sequence of two strains of HuCV, HuCV/3C/92/UK, and HuCV/5C/92/UK differed by only one or two amino acids respectively in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase region from that of two strains of SRSV obtained from children in the United Kingdom, SRSV/4S/90/UK and Japan, SRSV/OTH-25/89/J which were found to have identical amino acid sequences. The use of an EIA for detection of NV antigen employing antisera raised to recombinant NV protein indicated that HuCVs and SRSVs obtained from children and adults in the United Kingdom were antigenically distinct from the prototype Norwalk virus, NV/8fIIa/68/US."

The objectives of this research are: i) identify the pregnant women that are coinfected by HIV and HBV at Saint Camille Medical Centre; ii) use three antiretroviral drugs (zidovudine, nevirapine and lamivudine) to interrupt the vertical transmission of HIV and HBV from infected mothers; and iii) use the PCR technique to diagnose children who are vertically infected by these viruses in order to offer them an early medical assistance. At Saint Camille Medical Centre, 115 pregnant women, aged from 19 to 41 years, were diagnosed as HIV-positive and, among them, 14 coinfected with HBV. They had at least 32 weeks of amenorrhoea and all of them received the HAART, which contained lamivudine. Two to six months after childbirth, the babies underwent PCR diagnosis for HIV and HBV. The results revealed that, among these mothers, 64.4% were housewives, 36.5% were illiterates, and only 1.7% had a university degree. The rate of vertical transmission of HIV and HBV was 0.0% (0/115) and 21.4% (3/14), respectively. The 3 mothers who transmitted the HBV to their children had all HBsAg, HbeAg, and HBV DNA positive. An antiretroviral therapy that in addition to zidovudine and nevirapine includes lamivudine could, as in the present study, block or reduce the vertical transmission in HIV positive pregnant women who are coinfected with HBV."

Staining of inoculated cell cultures with specific antibodies was followed by immunoperoxidase detection. Of fecal specimens from 140 children under 6 years of age, four were positive by the immunoperoxidase method. The nucleotide identity between these samples and additional EV22 isolates from Finland and the United States varied from 78% to 93% when studied by specific polymerase chain reaction, followed by sequence analysis of the amplicons. One-hundred ten single serum specimens collected from individuals in different age groups to find out the prevalence of EV22 antibodies were subjected to neutralization tests. Out of 21 neonates, 20 (95%) had EV22 antibodies, probably of maternal origin. Of 10 children aged 2-12 months, only two had neutralizing antibodies to EV22. The antibody levels increased rapidly by age, and among 30 adults tested, 29 (97%) were seropositive. A clear difference was observed with the occurrence of echovirus 30 (EV30) antibodies, which were less prevalent and appeared later in life. A review of previously published studies concerning the epidemiology of EV22 infections showed that gastroenteritis and respiratory infections are the most common symptoms observed in EV22 infections."

CD011926,0,9815214,0,Chemokine receptors and the molecular basis for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 entry into peripheral hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny.,"There exist at least two major coreceptors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 entry into target cells, the CXCR-4 and CCR-5 chemokine receptors for T lymphocyte-tropic and macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1, respectively. Highly purified human CD34 cells derived from umbilical cord blood were shown not to express CD4, CXCR-4, and CCR-5 on their cell membranes, as analyzed by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analyses. However, expression of these molecules was inducible when highly purified CD34 cells underwent proliferation and differentiation along myeloid cell lineages, in the presence of suitable cocktails of hematopoietic growth factors. HIV-1 infectivity studies showed that macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 could efficiently infect differentiated CD34 cells. T lymphocyte-tropic strains could not infect CD34 cells before or after induction of receptors and coreceptors. These data suggest that HIV-1 infection of CD34 cells and their progeny depends on membrane expression of the critical CD4 receptor, as well as certain chemokine coreceptors."

CD011926,0,10408873,0,Effect of material deprivation on Epstein-Barr virus infection in Hodgkin's disease in the West Midlands.,"We have used Townsend scores from postcode data to compare levels of material deprivation and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positivity for 223 patients diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease (HD) in the period 1981-1997. The presence of EBV in HD tumours was determined using in situ hybridization to target the abundantly expressed EBV early RNAs. EBV was detected in the malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells in 47/223 HD cases (21%). There was found to be a tendency for higher Townsend scores (indicative of higher levels of material deprivation) in EBV-positive HD patients, but this association was not statistically significant. When various subgroups of patients from the study were examined separately the indication of higher Townsend scores in EBV-positive patients was found to be more marked for patients with mixed cellularity disease (P = 0.09) and for females (P = 0.03). The results of this study suggest that differences in the level of material deprivation are important in determining the likelihood of EBV-positive HD in the UK, particularly for certain subgroups of patients. It is not known what specific socioeconomic factors are responsible for these differences, although alterations in the timing or rate of primary EBV infection, or decline in the level of EBV-specific immunity, may be important."

There was no collection of fluid in soft tissue or joints in ultrasonography and Doppler examination showed normal venous return in both the lower limbs. Blood culture revealed growth of Candida albicans sensitive to fluconazole. The mother did not take any antenatal care and her HIV status was evident only after delivery during routine screening. DNA PCR for HIV-1 of the neonate done on day 45 and day 48 were positive with a viral load of 12 million copies/mL and his CD4 count was 24%. He was diagnosed as severe HIV-associated clinical disease with severe immunosuppression as per WHO classification and was put on combination antiretroviral therapy, Pneumocystis chemoprophylaxis and fluconazole. He responded well to treatment, repeat x-ray done at 4 months was normal except mild bowing of both the femurs. In the present case we wanted to emphasize the need of proper antenatal care and universal HIV-testing as the key to prevent mother-to-child transmission and severe HIV disease as in this case."

Nasal and throat swabs were collected from 397 children with URTIs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were collected from 323 children with LRTIs. RT-PCR/PCR was used to examine all samples for IFV, PIV, RSV, RV, hMPV, HBoV, CoV, ADV, RSV, and EV. Viral pathogens were detected in 47.10% of URTI samples and 66.57% samples, and the incidence of viral coinfection was 5.29% and 21.05%, respectively. IFV was the most common virus in URTIs, with a detection rate of 19.40%, followed by PIV (10.83%), RV (10.58%), and EV (6.30%). For LRTIs, PIV and RV were both detected in 27% of samples, followed by RSV (9.91%), HBoV (8.36%), IFV (5.57%), and hMPV (5.57%). RSV and HBoV were more prevalent in the youngest children of no more than six months. Meanwhile, RV, PIV, and RSV were the most frequent viruses combined with bacterial pathogens in LRTIs. In conclusion, the spectrum of respiratory virus infections in URTIs and LRTIs differed in terms of the most common pathogens, seasonal distribution, and coinfection rate."
CD011926,0,10664236,0,Elevated gene expression of interleukin-8 in cord blood is a sensitive marker for neonatal infection.,"Bacterial infection is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis is essential for a successful treatment and outcome. Cytokine plasma levels are suggested to be sensitive parameters for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. The aim of this study was to assess cytokine mRNA expression in cord blood cells as a marker for neonatal infection. In a prospective study, cord blood samples of neonates with septic bacterial infection were analyzed qualitatively and semiquantitatively by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, as well as for IL-8 cord plasma levels. Results were compared to those of non-septic neonates. A method was used requiring only a microvolume (25 microl or less) of cord blood. Cord plasma levels of IL-8 were significantly elevated in septic infants (n = 9) when compared to infants with not confirmed sepsis (n = 22) and healthy infants that served as controls (n = 68) (median 1,686 vs 262.7 vs 33.1 pg/ml, P < 0.001). The presence of IL-6 and TNF-alpha gene expression was observed more frequently in septic than in non-septic patients; sensitivity, however, reached only 56 and 67%, respectively. When using a semiquantitative approach for analyzing IL-8 mRNA levels, a high sensitivity (86%) and specificity (96%) for the detection of sepsis was achieved. A new method for the early diagnosis of neonatal infection is described measuring cytokine mRNA in neonatal cord blood cells. With this molecular approach only a microvolume of blood is required for analysis."

In this study, amplification of the invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene by PCR and standard culture methods was used to identify Shigella species or EIEC among 154 patients with dysentery, 154 age-matched controls, and family contacts in Thailand. The ipaH PCR system increased the detection of Shigella species and EIEC from 58% to 79% among patients with dysentery and from 6% to 22% among 527 family contacts; 75% of infections in family members were asymptomatic. Detection of the ipaH gene was statistically associated with dysentery. Household contacts of patients with shigellosis diagnosed only by PCR had significantly higher rates of shigellosis than household contacts of patients who did not have Shigella or EIEC infections. Detection of the ipaH gene by PCR is far more sensitive than detection by standard culture and is highly correlated with evidence of Shigella transmission among family contacts."

Specimens were simultaneously screened and confirmed with a previously published real time PCR assay for the opa gene (extra primers were included to increase sensitivity) and the porA gene respectively. The opa gene screen and initial porA gene confirmation yielded an N. gonorrhoeae positivity rate of 0.88% (20/2273) and 0.49% (11/2191) for specimens and patients respectively. A 16S rDNA High Resolution Melt confirmatory PCR was developed subsequently; this reduced the N. gonorrhoeae positivity rate to 0.35% (8/2273) and 0.27% (6/2191) for specimens and patients respectively (not altered by 16S sequencing). The higher rate of secondary confirmation (16S HRM) in patients compared with samples was due to the detection of species other than N. gonorrhoeae detected by the initial screening and confirmation test. This underlines the importance of performing the secondary confirmatory test that has been developed in this study."

The study covered 81 HTLV-I-seropositive mothers and their 216 children aged between 18 months old and 12 years old. All plasma samples were tested for the presence of HTLV-I antibodies by ELISA, immunofluorescence assay and Western blot. HTLV-I provirus was detected, in the DNA extracted from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for 3 different HTLV-I genomic regions (LTR, gag and pX) and quantified by a competitive PCR assay. Out of the 216 children, 21 were found to be HTLV-I-seropositive, giving a crude HTLV-I transmission rate of 9.7%, while among the 180 breast-fed children 10.6% were HTLV-I-seropositive. Perfect concordance between serological and PCR results was observed, and none of the 195 HTLV-I-negative children was found HTLV-I-positive by PCR. In conditional (by family) logistic-regression models, HTLV-I seropositivity in children was associated with an elevated maternal anti-HTLV-I-antibody titer (OR 2.2, p = 0.0013), a high maternal HTLV-I proviral load (OR 2.6, p = 0.033) and child's gender, girls being more frequently HTLV-I-infected than boys: OR 3.6, p = 0.0077 in the model including maternal anti-HTLV-I-antibody titer and OR 4.1, p = 0.002 in the model including the maternal HTLV-I proviral load."

A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral detection was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Analyses were conducted using univariate statistical methods. Of the 259 infants and young children, at least one respiratory virus was detected in 130 samples (50%). The most prevalent viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 43%; n = 56), adenovirus (15%; n = 20), and parainfluenza virus (PIV) (11%; n = 14). Dual or multiple viral infections were found in 23 cases (18%). The three most prominent symptoms of the cohort were fever (78%; n = 201), tachypnoea (77%; n = 200), and runny nose (61%; n = 158). The majority had bronchiolitis (39%; n = 101) while 37% (n = 96) had pneumonia. RSV was more likely to affect those that were young (4 months vs. 7.5 months; P = 0.002) and had tachypnoea (93% vs. 69%; P = 0.004), lower respiratory tract infections (91% vs. 80%; P = 0.039), and bronchiolitis (57% vs. 38%; P = 0.024).

Among cases, the following percentages of enteric pathogens were detected: norovirus 36%, rotavirus A 31%, sapovirus 4%, Salmonella spp. 6%, Campylobacter jejuni 13%, Campylobacter coli 2%, other Campylobacter spp. 8%, enteroaggregative E. coli 6%, Giardia spp. 2%, and Cryptosporidium spp. 2%. The present study provides additional insight into the aetiology of infectious intestinal disease in England and highlights the occurrence of viral infections in cases as well as in asymptomatic individuals. Other notable findings include the frequent presence of Campylobacter spp. other than C. jejuni or C. coli, the high frequency of multiple agents in 41% of cases and in 13% of controls, and the variation in the aetiology and rate of infection found for different age groups. The results demonstrate the greater sensitivity of PCR-based methods compared to current conventional methods."
CD011926,0,20217165,0,Molecular epidemiology of rotaviruses in Bulgaria: annual shift of the predominant genotype.,"Rotavirus molecular epidemiology investigations provide important information about the incidence of rotavirus diseases and rotavirus strains in circulation in the prevaccine era. The purpose of this investigation was to study the burden of rotavirus disease, rotavirus strain diversity, and epidemiology specificities of rotavirus infections in Bulgaria. A total of 3,130 stools collected between 2005 and 2008 were tested by immune enzyme tests. G-P genotype identification of rotavirus strains were performed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rotavirus etiology was confirmed in 32.4% of the samples tested. Rotaviruses affected predominantly children under 5 years of age (95.5%), with a peak prevalence between the ages of 7 and 36 months. Four of the five globally distributed rotavirus strains (G1P[8], G2P[4], G4P[8], and G9P[8]) constituted 97.7% of all rotavirus strains in circulation. However, annual shifts of predominant rotavirus G-P genotypes were observed from season to season-G4P[8] was predominant in rotavirus season 2004/2005 (56.8%), but was replaced by G9P[8] in 2005/2006 (77.7%), and G2P[4] (41.6%) and G1P[8] (39.5%) in the following two consecutive rotavirus seasons. Year-round circulation of rotaviruses in the country with increased incidence in the winter-spring season and unexpected peaks preceding the rotavirus seasons were observed. Molecular epidemiology data are needed in Bulgaria for health policy makers in order to introduce routine rotavirus vaccination. The monitoring of rotavirus genetic diversity in Bulgaria in the postvaccination period will contribute to a successful rotavirus vaccination program."
CD011926,0,16117559,0,"Tuberculosis in neonates and infants: epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management issues.","Tuberculosis is one of the leading infectious causes of death and as such represents a major global health problem. Infants may develop congenital tuberculosis from an infectious mother or, most commonly, they may acquire postnatal disease by contact with an infectious adult source. Important epidemiologic, pathogenetic, and clinical data regarding the management of infantile disease are reviewed. Diagnostic evaluation includes tuberculin skin tests, chest radiography and other imaging studies, smears and cultures, examination of the cerebrospinal fluid, and polymerase chain reaction, as well as the more recent interferon-gamma assay. Pregnant women with a positive Mantoux skin test but normal chest x-ray should either start chemoprophylaxis during gestation or after delivery depending on the likelihood of being recently infected, their risk of progression to disease, as well as their clinical evidence of disease. Pregnant women with a positive Mantoux skin test and chest x-ray or symptoms indicative of active disease should be treated with non-teratogenic agents during gestation; all household contacts should also be screened. When tuberculosis is suspected around delivery, the mother should be assessed by chest x-ray and sputum smear; separation of mother and offspring is indicated only if the mother is non-adherent to medical treatment, needs to be hospitalized, or when drug-resistant tuberculosis is involved. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, treatment of latent infection is highly effective with isoniazid administration for 9 months. This regimen may be extended to 12 months for immunocompromised patients. When drug resistance is suspected, combination therapies, which usually consist of isoniazid with rifampin (rifampicin), are administered until the results of susceptibility tests become available. Organisms resistant to isoniazid only may be treated with rifampin alone for a total of 6-9 months. All infants with tuberculosis disease should be started on four agents (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin) until drug susceptibility is assessed. For susceptible intrathoracic tuberculosis, isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide are administered for a total of 2 months, at which point pyrazinamide is withdrawn and the other two agents are continued for another 4-10 months depending on the severity of the disease. The same regimen may be applied in extrapulmonary tuberculosis with the exception of skeletal, miliary, and CNS disease, which require daily administration of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin for 1-2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin daily or twice weekly for another 10 months. When drug-resistant tuberculosis is suspected, a regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide plus either streptomycin or ethambutol should be initially prescribed, until the results of susceptibility tests become available. HIV-seropositive infants with pulmonary tuberculosis should receive isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or an aminoglycoside for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for a total of at least 12 months. Apart from conventional antimycobacterial agents, novel therapeutic modalities, which stimulate the host immune system such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor antagonists have been tested with promising results."
CD011926,0,24406851,0,"Prevailing Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase 108-asparagine in Hodeidah, Yemen: a questionable sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine partner within the artemisinin-based combination therapy.","Given that the evolution and spread of resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) have been documented at a quick pace worldwide, the present study investigated the mutant Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase 108-asparagine (dhfr 108 N) as a key marker of resistance to the combination among parasite isolates from Hodeidah. The association of parasitologic indices with the dhfr 108 N mutant allele was also studied. Ninety patients with microscopically confirmed P. falciparum infection from Hodeidah were included in the present study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism approach was adopted for the molecular detection of this marker. The dhfr 108 N was detected among about 61% of P. falciparum isolates, in its pure and mixed-type forms, from Hodeidah. Age, gender and residence of patients were not significant predictors for the presence of the mutant allele among parasite isolates. In contrast, a history of malaria and antimalarial drug intake in the year preceding the study as well as frequent antimalarial drug intake were significantly associated with this mutant allele. The high frequency of dhfr 108 N among parasites isolates makes the role of SP questionable as a partner with outstanding effectiveness within the ACT, at least, in the near future. SP plus artesunate should be monitored for its antimalarial efficacy at regular intervals, preferably through the molecular detection of resistance-associated mutations."
CD011926,0,16691187,0,Gene-expression profiling of HIV-1 infection and perinatal transmission in Botswana.,"Perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 represents a major problem in many regions of the world, especially Southern Africa. With the exception of viral and proviral load, the role for maternal cofactors in perinatal transmission outcome is largely unknown. In this study, an assessment was made of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene-expression profiles to better understand transcriptional changes associated with HIV-1 infection and perinatal transmission among young adult mothers with infants in Botswana. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells specimens were used from 25 HIV+ drug naive and 20 HIV- healthy mothers, similar in age and location, collected in 1999-2000 and 2003, and processed with the exact same methods, as previously described. Expression profiling of 22 277 microarray gene probes implicated a broad initiation of innate response gene-sets, including toll-like receptor, interferon-stimulated and antiviral RNA response pathways in association with maternal HIV-1 infection. Maternal transmission status was further associated with host genes that influence RNA processing and splicing patterns. In addition to real-time polymerase chain reaction validation of specific genes, enriched category validation of PBMC profiles was conducted using two independent data sets for either HIV-1 infection or an unrelated RNA virus, severe acute respiratory virus infection. HIV-1 pathogen-specific host profiles should prove a useful tool in infection and transmission intervention efforts worldwide."

These sera were negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IgM-ELISA) for either rubella (495), toxoplasma (41), cytomegalovirus (12), measles (40), dengue (56), and they were submitted to nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for B19 DNA and commercial IgM-ELISA for B19. In 39 abortion cases, IgM or DNA were not detected, therefore they were not took into account for analysis. Specific DNA and IgM were detected respectively in 71 (14.5%) and IgM in 62 (12.7%) sera from 487 sera analyzed. IgM and DNA were simultaneously detected in 43 (8.8%), while agreement among the results by PCR and IgM-ELISA was observed in 440 (90.4%). The sera were collected from January 1999 to December 2000, most of them in 1999 (325), during winter and spring. The major number of clinical cases was observed in the age group from one to ten years old. IgM or DNA were detected in 23 from 51 municipal districts of the state of Rio de Janeiro, where the samples were collected."
CD011926,0,17002608,0,"Detection of human coronavirus NL63, human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus in children with respiratory tract infections in south-west Sweden.","Two recently detected viruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), have been associated with acute respiratory tract infections, particularly in young children. This study investigated the frequency of hMPV and HCoV-NL63 infections in Swedish children by screening 221 nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected between November 2003 and May 2005, from 212 children attending the paediatric department of a county hospital in Sweden or submitted from local general practitioners. The samples were originally submitted to be tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and were examined retrospectively for hMPV and HCoV-NL63 by RT-PCR. Of the 212 patients, 101 were positive for RSV (48%), 22 (10%) were positive for hMPV, and 12 (6%) were positive for HCoV-NL63. The frequency of HCoV-NL63 infection increased from 1% in 2003-2004 to 10% in 2004-2005. Sequence analysis of parts of the coronavirus genomes showed considerable similarity to the HCoV-NL63 prototype sequence. The study demonstrated that HCoV-NL63 and hMPV occur in south-west Sweden with essentially the same frequency, seasonal distribution and clinical characteristics as have been reported in other countries."
CD011926,0,24296485,0,High latency of tuberculosis manifestation in a premature extremely low birth weight infant with favorable outcome.,"We report a case of possible congenital tuberculosis in a 22+2 weeks, 460 g, vaginally delivered female infant born to a mother suffering from tuberculous endometritis, diagnosed soon after delivery. At 156 days of age, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected via PCR from the infant's gastric juice and was subsequently isolated. There was no evidence for horizontal transmission. Mother and child were treated successfully. This case illustrates the possibility of significant latency between infection and clinical manifestation in preterm infants and also emphasizes the need for urgent treatment of neonates in such situations."
CD011926,0,23303616,0,Congenital rubella with agenesis of the inferior cerebellar vermis and total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage.,"Congenital rubella infection has been associated with a number of abnormalities including cardiac, central nervous system and placental complications. We present a case with multiple fetal abnormalities detected on prenatal ultrasound, and confirmed postnatally, that included a single umbilical artery, severe tricuspid regurgitation, micrognathia and agenesis of the inferior cerebellar vermis. Postnatal echocardiography additionally revealed unobstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (TAPVD) into the coronary sinus. Placental examination showed signs of placentitis, and polymerase chain reaction on neonatal serum was positive for rubella. Following a multidisciplinary team review, it was decided to provide only supportive care, and the infant died at 6 months of age owing to a respiratory tract infection. To our knowledge, TAPVD and agenesis of the inferior cerebellar vermis have not been reported previously in association with congenital rubella infection. This case illustrates how congenital infection may present in atypical ways and stresses the importance of considering congenital infection in the differential diagnosis of fetal anomalies when multiple features are present."

This study was aimed at analyzing enteroviruses from patients with these diseases in Thailand in 2012. Detection and genotype determination of enteroviruses were accomplished by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of the VP1 region. Enterovirus-positive samples were differentiated into 17 genotypes (coxsackievirus A4 (CAV4), A5, A6, A8, A9, A10, A12, A16, A21, B1, B2, B4, B5, echovirus 7, 16, 25 and Enterovirus 71). The result showed CAV6 (33.5%), followed by CAV16 (9.4%) and EV71 (8.8%) as the most frequent genotypes in HFMD, CAV8 (19.3%) in herpangina and CAV6 (1.5%) in influenza like illness. Enterovirus infections were most prevalent during July with 34.4% in HFMD, 39.8% in herpangina and 1.6% in ILI. The higher enterovirus infection associated with HFMD and herpangina occurred in infants over one year-old. This represents the first report describing the circulation of multiple enteroviruses in Thailand."
CD011926,0,18449584,0,Outcome for invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections.,"We report a survey of invasive Staphylococcus aureus (ISA) infections concerning outcome variables such as mortality, recurrence and residual symptoms. A prospective, population-based study of all cases of ISA was conducted in the catchment area of Skaraborg Hospital (population 255,109) in western Sweden during the period from 1st March 2003 to 28th February 2005. One hundred and fifty-seven patients were included. Recurrences were seen in 13 cases (9.3%). Thirty patients (19.1%) died during the first 28 days. Mortality rates for complicated bacteraemia and severe sepsis were 32% and 54%, respectively. Older patients (>65 years of age), patients with concomitant heart disease and patients with endovascular infections all suffered higher mortality. Line-associated infections had a higher recurrence rate. Residual symptoms were common, with 34% of the living patients reporting incomplete recovery. Accessory gene regulator (agr) type within the bacteria did not affect disease presentation. We conclude that ISA infections are of major medical importance, with high rates of mortality (19.1%), recurrence (9.3%) and residual functional impairment (34%)."

Samples from patients in Southern Brazil, from June to December 2009, were examined and the viral load was correlated with epidemiological data. All samples were analyzed by qRT-PCR for detection of the 2009-pandemic Influenza A (H1N1). Relative viral loads were assessed based on the 2(-ΔCT) method and epidemiological data were obtained for each patient, following ethical policies. A total of 933 samples were positive for pH1N1 (2009) influenza; 172 were positive for seasonal influenza A; 13 were undetermined; 1992 samples were negative for influenza A. Combined molecular and epidemiological data were available for 38 seasonal and 198 pandemic samples. The median viral load was higher in pandemic than in seasonal influenza samples; in patients infected with pH1N1 (2009), viral load associated positively with chills, myalgia and rhinorrhea, and negatively with dyspnea, but no association was observed with other symptoms, nor with clinical conditions such as pregnancy, smoking, immunodepression and co-morbidities. Regarding patients infected with seasonal influenza, viral loads did not show statistically significant association with any of the symptoms. This is the first study in Brazil that examines epidemiological and molecular data from the 2009 influenza pandemic. The results may serve as a basis for developing strategies to control human-to-human infection and viral dissemination, and for implementing effective measures and public health policies against future novel disease outbreaks."

Twenty-six clinical isolates of ESBL-positive rods were collected from 24 patients. Infections incidence was confirmed on the level 3.4/1000 patientdays (pds), among infection dominated blood infection (41%) and pneumonia (31%). All isolates were analyzed for the presence of genes of the resistance (bla)SHV, (bla)TEM i (bla)CTX-M by the multiplex PCR amplification. Isolates were genotyped by PFGE. All isolates were characterized by the presence of the (bla)CTX-M gene. The most of ESBL-positive strains were polyclonal. Three endemic clones of the bacteria were distinguished (among Enterobacter and Klebsiella) which could be moved between patients. Appearing of infection among hospitalized newborn babies showed no relation with the frequency isolation of strains with ESBL phenotype during the period of the study at hospital. The dissemination of ESBLs is due to clonal spread or plasmid dissemination among or between species."
