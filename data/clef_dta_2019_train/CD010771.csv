CD010771,0,23268875,0,[Establishment of a short-form screening test for cognitive decline as part of a newly developed comprehensive geriatric assessment initiative named 'Dr. Superman'].,"The assessment of cognitive function is important in comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), and several standardized screening tests for dementia such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) are available. However, it takes 5 to 20 minutes to perform the MMSE. We have developed a CGA initiative named 'Dr. Superman' which is designed to accomplish CGA within 10 minutes. In this study, we evaluated a short-form screening test for cognitive decline preceding the MMSE."

CD010771,0,23172761,0,The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly individuals in screening mild cognitive impairment with or without functional impairment.,"The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly individuals (IQCODE) is a reliable, validated informant-based instrument. Most of the studies well support the validity of the IQCODE in dementia screening, but the sensitivity of the rating scale at the early stage during the course of dementia is limited. In this study, we investigate the utility of the IQCODE for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the discriminative power of the IQCODE in patients having MCI with and without functional impairment. The samples included mild Alzheimer disease (AD, N=280), MCI ([N=657], further divided into 2 subgroups: patients with MCI having functional impairment [MCI-fi, N=357] and patients having MCI without functional impairment [MCI-fn, N=300]), and normal cognition (NC, N=274). The IQCODE, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and other neuropsychological tests were administered to all participants. Logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic ability of the IQCODE, compared to the MMSE. The optimal cutoff scores of the IQCODE were 3.19 for the MCI (sensitivity/specificity: 0.979/0.714) and MCI-fn (0.900/0.817), 3.25 for the MCI-fi (0.978/0.701), and 3.31 for mild AD (0.893/0.779), while the MMSE was identical, that is 26, for both MCI and its functional normal and functional impaired subgroups (0.892/0.755, 0.867/0.745, and 0.913/0.745, respectively) and 24 for mild AD (0.807/0.836). The discriminating accuracy of the IQCODE was slightly superior to that of the MMSE but did not reach statistical significance. Our study suggests that the IQCODE might be useful in screening for MCI, with hierarchical scores indicating functional normal or impaired."

CD010771,0,22785401,0,High prevalence of dementia in a community-based survey of older people from Brazil: association with intellectual activity rather than education.,"Although several surveys have been conducted around the world, few surveys have investigated the prevalence of dementia in Latin America. The aim of this study was to estimate dementia prevalence in a community sample in Ribeir√£o Preto, Brazil, and to evaluate its distribution across several socio-demographic and clinical characteristics and habits. The population was aged 60 years and older and a representative sample from three different social regions. The screening instruments used in the first phase were the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Fuld Object-Memory Evaluation, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, and the Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale. In the second phase, the Cambridge Examination was employed to diagnose dementia according to the DSM-IV criteria. The estimate of dementia prevalence was adjusted for screening instrument performance, using the positive and negative predictive values. The data were weighted to compare frequencies, considering the sampling and the non-response effect, and subjected to multivariate analysis. In all, 1.145 elderly subjects were evaluated (mean age: 70.9 years), of whom 63.4% were female and 52.8% had up to 4 years of schooling (participation rates at the first and the second phases were 62.6 and 60%, respectively). The observed and estimated prevalences of dementia were 5.9% and 12.5%, respectively (n = 68). Alzheimer's disease was the main cause (60.3%). Dementia was associated with old age, low education, stroke, absence of arthritis, and not reading books. The estimated prevalence of dementia was higher than the prevalence previously found. Associated factors confirmed the importance of intellectual activities in prevention."

CD010771,0,21626569,0,Subtle cognitive impairment in elders with Mini-Mental State Examination scores within the 'normal' range.,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is commonly used as a screening test for dementia, yet MMSE scores above the cut-off for dementia (24-30) are widely thought to have limited utility, particularly in older persons. The study investigates whether scores within this range can be indicative of pre-symptomatic levels of cognitive impairment."
CD010771,0,21399482,0,Racial differences in the recognition of cognitive dysfunction in older persons.,"We assessed the influence of race and education on informants' reports of cognitive decline in 252 community-residing older persons who were receiving services from senior health agencies. An expert consensus panel made diagnoses of normal cognition, cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), and dementia based on clinical evaluations and standardized neuropsychological testing (using both population and race-adjusted norms). Informants were interviewed using the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Informants of black participants with CIND reported less cognitive decline (lower IQCODE scores) than informants of white CIND participants [3.03 (0.61) vs. 3.23 (0.41); t (117)=2.12, P‚â§0.036] even though there were no significant differences in the participants' functional and neuropsychological impairments. An analysis of covariance which controlled for informant education indicated that this difference in IQCODE scores was attributable to the fact that black informants had fewer years of education than white informants. There was no statistically significant difference in IQCODE scores for black and white participants with dementia [4.0 (0.7) vs. 4.3 (0.7); t (67)=1.37, P=0.177]. We conclude that racially determined differences in perceptions of early cognitive decline and education may influence informant ratings of older persons. These differences may contribute to disparities in the detection and treatment of cognitive disorders in older black persons."
CD010771,0,22882809,0,An informant questionnaire for detecting Alzheimer's disease: are some items better than others?,"A decline in everyday cognitive functioning is important for diagnosing dementia. Informant questionnaires, such as the informant questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly (IQCODE), are used to measure this. Previously, conflicting results on the IQCODEs ability to discriminate between Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively healthy elderly were found. We aim to investigate whether specific groups of items are more useful than others in discriminating between these patient groups. Informants of 180 AD, 59 MCI, and 89 patients with subjective memory complaints (SMC) completed the IQCODE. To investigate the grouping of questionnaire items, we used a two-dimensional graded response model (GRM).The association between IQCODE, age, gender, education, and diagnosis was modeled using structural equation modeling. The GRM with two groups of items fitted better than the unidimensional model. However, the high correlation between the dimensions (r=.90) suggested unidimensionality. The structural model showed that the IQCODE was able to differentiate between all patient groups. The IQCODE can be considered as unidimensional and as a useful addition to diagnostic screening in a memory clinic setting, as it was able to distinguish between AD, MCI, and SMC and was not influenced by gender or education."
CD010771,0,22086219,0,The Cognitive Change in Women study (CCW): informant ratings of cognitive change but not self-ratings are associated with neuropsychological performance over 3 years.,"The value of self-reported memory complaints for identifying or predicting future cognitive decline or dementia is controversial, but observations from a third party, or ""informant,"" may prove more useful. The relationship between Informant and Self-ratings of cognitive status and neuropsychological test scores was examined in a cohort of 384 nondemented, community-dwelling women, aged 60 years and older, participating in a single-site Women's Health Initiative ancillary study. Each participant and her respective informant separately completed the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Participants also underwent neuropsychological testing and responded to questionnaires on depression and functioning in complex activities of daily living. All neuropsychological test scores were significantly correlated (P values <0.05 to <0.01) with IQCODE ratings whereas Self-ratings overestimated cognitive functioning in some domains. Furthermore, the Self and Informant ratings were both positively correlated with depression and negatively correlated with participants' activity level. Therefore, informant judgments of functional abilities are robust predictors of cognitive status in high functioning nondemented women. These results suggest that informants may be sensitive to changes that are not clinically significant but that may represent an incipient trend for decline."

CD010771,0,21908910,0,Measuring memory in large group settings using a continuous recognition test.,"Memory function generally deteriorates with age, and memory impairments are a common symptom of serious illness such as dementia. Although screening tests are widely used throughout Medicine, they are not yet commonly used to detect memory impairments. The objective of this study was to characterize an audience-based memory test suitable for administration to a large number of individuals simultaneously. A continuous recognition test was developed to assess memory function in audiences using a slide-show in which 50 images were presented, of which 25 were repeated. Audience members responded by recording if an image was a repetition. The test was administered to a total of 1018 participants at 25 sites with an average audience size of 41 individuals (range = 9-142). A total of 868 individuals aged 40-97 y completed the test appropriately and provided their age, education level, and gender. Recognition memory as measured by discriminability (d') showed a significant decline with age (40-49 y old, d' = 3.51; 90-99 y old, d' = 1.95, p < 0.001) together with a greater than three-fold increase in variability. Individuals with less than 13 y of education had lower scores than those with more education (d' = 2.13 vs. 2.88, respectively, p < 0.001). These results are consistent with the known effects of age and education on memory. There were no significant effects of gender on test performance. Such memory tests represent a practical and novel approach to screen for the signs of early dementia."
CD010771,0,21903447,0,Decreased cognitive functioning in patients with advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Cognitive impairment causes a delay in diagnosis and treatment of the various cancer entities, resulting in reduced surgical outcomes and patient survival. However, no investigations have been carried out as to whether an association exists between cognitive functioning and tumour size in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, 46 patients with OSCC were evaluated by using a screening test for dementia, consisting of a combination of the mini-mental state examination and the clock test (81% sensitivity and 90% specificity). Test scores were correlated with tumour size according to the TNM staging system, which was categorized as being either limited (T1, T2; n=24) or advanced (T3, T4; n=22). No difference in age (P=0.172), sex (P=0.330), the percentage of drinkers (P=0.090) or the percentage of smokers (P=0.484) was evident between the groups. Patients with advanced tumour size scored significantly lower (median 5.5 of 9 possible points) when compared with those having tumours of a limited size (median 9 of 9 possible points; P=0.005). The median score of patients with T3/T4 tumours suggested the need for comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations for dementia. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the correlation of reduced cognitive functioning in patients with advanced OSCC. As a consequence, instructions for the identification of early signs and of symptoms of oral cancer are strongly recommended for relatives and nursing staff of patients with cognitive impairment. Such patients might need immediate treatment for oral cancer but might not be able to understand the significance of their symptoms and therefore present late, often too late."
CD010771,0,21856971,0,The IQCODE versus a single-item informant measure to discriminate between cognitively intact individuals and individuals with dementia or cognitive impairment.,"The present study evaluated the short Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE 2-year version) against a single item concerning informant's perception of patient's memory, as screening tools for CIND not dementia (CIND) and dementia. Data were drawn from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study, which is a national study that was specifically designed to provide population-based estimates of cognitive impairment and dementia in the United States. The study employed a comprehensive dementia evaluation that yielded an expert consensus-based diagnosis. Receiver-operating curves, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value were calculated. Both the IQCODE and the single-item instrument demonstrated only mild-to-moderate abilities to discriminate between cognitively intact individuals and individuals with CIND. Whereas the ability of the IQCODE to discriminate between cognitively intact individuals and individuals with dementia was moderate, the single-item instrument showed an adequate ability to distinguish between cognitively intact individuals and individuals with dementia. Therefore, for screening purposes, asking informants a single question concerning patients' memory is sufficient. However, if additional data concerning patients' strengths and weaknesses are needed, the IQCODE may be desirable."

This study was carried out to evaluate the reliability, validity and clinical utility of a Brazilian telephone version of the Mini Mental State Examination (Braztel-MMSE) in a community sample of healthy elderly participants and AD patients. The MMSE and the Braztel-MMSE were applied to 66 AD patients and 67 healthy elderly participants. The test-retest reliability was strong and significant (r = .92, p = .01), and the correlation between the Braztel-MMSE and the MMSE were significant (p = .01) and strong (r = .92). The general screening ability of the Braztel-MMSE was high (AUC = 0.982; CI95% = 0.964-1.001).

CD010771,0,20852266,0,What are the causes of pre-existing dementia in patients with intracerebral haemorrhages?,"In intracerebral haemorrhage, the most frequent underlying vasculopathies are cerebral amyloid angiopathy and hypertensive vasculopathy. Although both are associated with cognitive impairment, no study has focused on pre-existing dementia in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. Therefore, we aimed to determine prevalence and mechanisms of pre-existing dementia in a large cohort of patients with an intracerebral haemorrhage. In a cohort of 417 patients, we evaluated the cognitive status before intracerebral haemorrhage with the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. The cut-off to diagnose cognitive impairment with no dementia was 53 and 64 for pre-existing dementia. We determined factors associated with pre-existing dementia in multivariate analyses in the overall cohort and among patients with lobar only or deep only intracerebral haemorrhages. We performed post-mortem examinations when possible. Of 417 patients (median age 72 years, interquartile range 58-79), 58 (14%; 95% CI 11-18%) patients had cognitive impairment with no dementia and 65 had pre-existing dementia (16%; 95% CI 12-19%). In lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, the prevalence was 23%, and factors associated with pre-existing dementia were increasing age (odds ratio: 1.09 per year; 95% CI 1.02-1.15), having <8 years of education (odds ratio: 8.37; 95% CI 1.91-36.65) and increasing cortical atrophy (odds ratio: 3.34 per step; 95% CI 1.40-7.96). The five autopsied patients had Alzheimer's disease with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In deep intracerebral haemorrhage, factors associated with pre-existing dementia were presence of old territorial vascular lesions (odds ratio: 4.52; 95% CI 1.18-17.42) and increasing severity of leucoaraiosis (odds ratio: 4.11 per step; 95% CI 1.73-9.75); the autopsied patient had small-vessel disease without Alzheimer's disease. These findings support the fact that pre-existing dementia is frequent in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and may be the consequence of two different mechanisms: neurodegeneration with Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in lobar intracerebral haemorrhage versus vascular process in deep intracerebral haemorrhage. These findings may contribute to the improvement of prevention and management of patients with intracerebral haemorrhages."

Because insufficient follow-up has occurred to validate the AD8 against the neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer's disease, we investigated whether AD8 scores correspond to impairment in episodic memory testing and changes in biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (cerebrospinal fluid and amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh compound B) characteristic of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. We also compared informant-based assessments with brief performance-based dementia screening measurements such as the Mini Mental State Exam. The sample (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ257) had a mean age of 75.4 years with 15.1 years of education; 88.7% were Caucasian and 45.5% were male. The sample was divided into two groups based on their AD8 scores: those with a negative dementia screening test (AD8 score 0 or 1, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ137) and those with a positive dementia screening test (AD8 score ‚â•2, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ120). Individuals with positive AD8 scores had abnormal Pittsburgh compound B binding (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) compared with individuals with negative AD8 scores. Individuals with positive AD8 tests and positive biomarkers scored in the impaired range on the Wechsler Logical Memory Story A (mean score 7.0‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4.5 for Pittsburgh compound B; mean score 7.6‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ5.3 for cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta protein 1-42). The AD8 area under the curve for Pittsburgh compound B was 0.737 (95% confidence interval: 0.64-0.83) and for cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta protein 1-42 was 0.685 (95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.77) suggesting good discrimination. The AD8 had superior sensitivity in detecting early stages of dementia compared with the Mini Mental State Examination. The AD8 had a likelihood ratio of a positive test of 5.8 (95% confidence interval: 5.4-6.3) and likelihood ratio of a negative test of 0.04 (95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.06), increasing the pre-test probability of an individual having symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with AD8 scores of ‚â•2 had a biomarker phenotype consistent with Alzheimer's disease and lower performance on episodic memory tests, supporting a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Informant-based assessments may be superior to performance-based screening measures such as the Mini Mental State Examination in corresponding to underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology, particularly at the earliest stages of decline. The use of a brief test such as the AD8 may improve strategies for detecting dementia in community settings where biomarkers may not be readily available, and may enrich clinical trial recruitment by increasing the likelihood that participants have underlying biomarker abnormalities."
CD010771,0,20799249,0,A Bayesian approach to simultaneously adjusting for verification and reference standard bias in diagnostic test studies.,"Verification bias arises in diagnostic test evaluation studies when the results from a first test are verified by a reference test only in a non-representative subsample of the original study subjects. This occurs, for example, when inclusion probabilities for the subsample depend on first-stage results and/or on a covariate related to disease status. Reference standard bias arises when the reference test itself has imperfect sensitivity and specificity, but this information is ignored in the analysis. Reference standard bias typically results in underestimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the test under evaluation, since subjects that are correctly diagnosed by the test can be considered as misdiagnosed owing to the imperfections in the reference standard. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian approach for simultaneously addressing both verification and reference standard bias. Our models consider two types of verification bias, first when subjects are selected for verification based on initial test results alone, and then when selection is based on initial test results and a covariate. We also present a model that adjusts for a third potential bias that arises when tests are analyzed assuming conditional independence between tests, but some dependence exists between the initial test and the reference test. We examine the properties of our models using simulated data, and then apply them to a study of a screening test for dementia, providing bias-adjusted estimates of the sensitivity and specificity."
CD010771,0,20738811,0,Computerized visuo-spatial memory test as a supplementary screening test for dementia.,"To prepare for a super-aging society, effective dementia screening tests are required. The most salient deficit appearing from the early stages of dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a deterioration in memory. The Hasegawa Dementia Scale-revised (HDS-R) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) are widely used in Japan to screen for dementia. Both place an emphasis on memory function, but neither examines visuo-spatial memory (VSM) function, even though VSM deficits are a sensitive marker for the detection of conversion to dementia. Furthermore, brief tests of VSM that are appropriate for screening have not been standardized. Thus, in the present study, we devised a brief, computer-aided short-term VSM test."

CD010771,0,20610187,0,Behavioral symptoms in long-term survivors of ischemic stroke.,"The range of behavioral changes occurring after stroke has not yet been fully characterized. To evaluate behavioral symptoms after stroke and clinical characteristics that may influence the number and frequency of such symptoms, we compared 53 survivors of mild ischemic stroke with 30 stroke-free controls. Stroke survivor and control participants completed self-ratings of behavioral symptoms and were administered measures of cognitive status (ie, Beck Depression Inventory II, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test). Informants of stroke survivors and controls completed ratings of behavioral symptoms and functional status (ie, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, and Functional Activities Questionnaire). More behavioral symptoms were observed in stroke survivors than in controls (mean [standard deviation] total number of symptoms on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, 2.1 [2.0] vs 1.1 [1.5]; P = .02). Informants of stroke survivors were more likely to recognize behavioral symptoms than were stroke survivors themselves. Higher initial stroke severity was associated with more behavioral symptoms. With more behavioral symptoms, there was more functional impairment. Our findings suggest that behavioral symptoms can have unique and troublesome effects on stroke patients. Future research is needed to understand how the identification of behavioral symptoms after stroke can improve care in stroke survivors."

This study consisted of 215 total subjects with a mean age of 75.24. The 84 cognitively impaired patients (excluding patients diagnosed as MCI) met all criteria set forth by NINCDS/ADRDA for the diagnosis of AD. Control participants consisted of 104 age-matched individuals who were cognitively unimpaired. All patients completed the CST prior to other routine neurocognitive procedures. The CST accurately classified 96% of the cognitively impaired individuals as compared to controls, while the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) accurately classified 71% and the Mini-Cog 69% in the same respect. In addition, the CST accurately classified 91% of the six experimental groups (control, MCI, early AD, mild to moderate, moderate to severe, and severe) as compared to 54% for the MMSE and 48% for the Mini-Cog. In conclusions, the CST demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity and specificity and is capable of accurately identifying cognitive impairment in patients with variable degrees of cognitive abnormality. This interactive internet-based cognitive screening tool may aid in early detection of cognitive impairment in the primary care setting. The ease of use and interpretation may also provide the means to obtain an accurate baseline from which to monitor cognitive changes over time."

CD010771,0,21140955,0,[Mokken scaling of the Cognitive Screening Test].,"The Cognitive Screening Test (CST) is a twenty-item orientation questionnaire in Dutch, that is commonly used to evaluate cognitive impairment. This study applied Mokken Scale Analysis, a non-parametric set of techniques derived from item response theory (IRT), to CST-data of 466 consecutive participants in psychogeriatric day care. The full item set and the standard short version of fourteen items both met the assumptions of the monotone homogeneity model, with scalability coefficient H = 0.39, which is considered weak. In order to select items that would fulfil the assumption of invariant item ordering or the double monotonicity model, the subjects were randomly partitioned into a training set (50% of the sample) and a test set (the remaining half). By means of an automated item selection eleven items were found to measure one latent trait, with H = 0.67 and item H coefficients larger than 0.51. Cross-validation of the item analysis in the remaining half of the subjects gave comparable values (H = 0.66; item H coefficients larger than 0.56). The selected items involve year, place of residence, birth date, the monarch's and prime minister's names, and their predecessors. Applying optimal discriminant analysis (ODA) it was found that the full set of twenty CST items performed best in distinguishing two predefined groups of patients of lower or higher cognitive ability, as established by an independent criterion derived from the Amsterdam Dementia Screening Test. The chance corrected predictive value or prognostic utility was 47.5% for the full item set, 45.2% for the fourteen items of the standard short version of the CST, and 46.1% for the homogeneous, unidimensional set of selected eleven items. The results of the item analysis support the application of the CST in cognitive assessment, and revealed a more reliable 'short' version of the CST than the standard short version (CST14)."

This is due to the increase in the prevalence of dementias and the raised awareness of cognitive impairment in neurological disorders. Two well-known bedside screening tests for dementias among the English-speaking population are the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE). However, such tests have not been developed for the Persian-speaking population, which is estimated at 120 million worldwide. In this study we developed the Persian ACE and MMSE, adopted from the English version. We also assessed the sensitivity and specificity of these tests in the identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We found that the Persian ACE at a cutoff point of 84, has a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 91% in discriminating MCI from a normal population; at 78, the test has a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 93% in differentiating MCI from AD, and at a similar cutoff point has a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96% in discriminating AD from a normal population.

Fifteen patients with very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 15 with mild AD were studied using the [(18)F]fluoro-deoxyglucose method. The 9 CASI domains were classified into four clusters (recent memory, frontal cortex cluster, posterior cortex cluster, and orientation). Using the region of interest method, the recent memory cluster was correlated with the bilateral hippocampal CMRglc, the frontal cortex cluster was correlated with the bilateral anterior and right inferior frontal CMRglc, the posterior cortex cluster was correlated with the bilateral temporo-parieto-occipital and occipital CMRglc, and the orientation cluster was correlated with the left anterior frontal CMRglc (Spearman's correlations). The use of statistical parametric mapping showed that most CASI domains were correlated with CMRglc of the left frontal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the angular gyrus. These findings show that the mental dysfunction assessed using CASI in AD patients has a neurobiological basis."

CAT accomplishes this by only using items that are appropriate for the level of ability of the patient under investigation. Potential advantages of CAT for clinical practice and research are efficient cognitive testing and a reduction of the test burden in elderly patients and consequently less measurement error during testing. In a two step method with previously collected CAMCOG data (n = 797) (1) patient abilities and CAMCOG item difficulties were estimated with the One Parameter Logistic Model (OPLM), a Rasch type of model. CAT was then used (2) to re-estimate the patient abilities. Despite an average test reduction of 60%, CAT estimates were in excellent agreement (intra-class correlation > 0.98) with the results based on the entire CAMCOG and they also had similar accuracy for the diagnosis of dementia (area under the curve 0.91) as the original CAMCOG. These results were replicated in an independent sample (n = 170).

The objectives of this study were to (1) study and compare the predialysis and postdialysis mini mental status examination score and 2 subscores and compare them with those of a control group and (2) determine the factors affecting these scores. This was a prospective study of 54 HD patients, which involved calculation of their predialysis (PrHDSc) and (2-4 weeks later) postdialysis (PoHDSc) scores and comparison of these with the control scores (CoSc). The mean scores for PreHDSc and PoHDSc were 26.5+/-2.7 and 26.4+/-3.3, respectively. Both were significantly lower than CoSc, 28.4+/-1.6 (95% CI for score difference 0.99-2.97, P<0.001). The subscores for orientation, registration, and recall (ORR) and attention (ATT) before and after HD were 14.2+/-1.3, 14.3+/-1.8, and 3.5+/-1.7, 3.2+/-1.8, respectively. Both were significantly lower than the CoSc, 15.2+/-1.2 and 4.2+/-1.1 (P=0.001 and 0.004, respectively). There were no significant differences between the PrHDSc and PoHDSc (P values of 0.87, 0.63, and 0.45, respectively).

This test demonstrates comparable discriminant validity to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and its subscales correlate well with the traditional neuropsychological tests upon which it is based. We discuss its relative merits and limitations in comparison to other current instruments as well as suggesting future directions for this field."

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the range of cognitive decline in which the IQCODE is most sensitive, using item response theory (IRT). Existing data (N = 740) from a sample of community-dwelling older adults was used for this purpose. A 2-parameter model estimating item difficulty and discrimination fit the data best. Additionally, the IQCODE provided the most psychometric information in the range of -0.5 < theta < 1.5, with peak information obtained at approximately theta = 0.4. Based on individuals' latent score (theta) estimates, items on the IQCODE are adequate for use as a screening tool for dementia.

Scalability of the items was tested according to criteria of nonparametric item response theory (IRT). Construct validity was determined by comparing the results with independent behaviour ratings of cognitive impairment and apathy, and scores on the Amsterdam Dementia Screening Test (ADS), a neuropsychological test of multiple cognitive domains. Nine items formed a strong primary Participation Scale with a coefficient H of 0.63. Behaviour ratings of cognitive impairment and apathy were significant predictors of the participation score. The same was true for the subtests Design Copying and Category Fluency of the ADS. Two meaningful small secondary scales were found, representing motivation and emotional stability, which add to the predominantly cognitive content of the primary scale. Total scores of the secondary scales correlated with affective parameters, but not with cognitive indices. The Participation Scale deserves to be expanded with items referring to motivation and emotional experience."

Eighty-eight patients with mild AD and 117 normal matched controls were evaluated. Patients and controls were divided into 4 groups according to educational level (illiterates, 1 to 3, 4 to 7, and > or =8 y) and were administered the CF test. In each group, cut-off values were determined using Receiver Operator Characteristic analysis. The areas under Receiver Operator Characteristic curves were 0.922/0.914/0.963/0.954, for the identification of AD among the groups of illiterates, 1 to 3, 4 to 7, and > or =8 years of education, respectively. The cut-off points for each group were 9 (S=90.5% and Sp=80.6%) for illiterates; 12 (S=95.2%% and Sp=80.0%) for 1 to 3 years; 12 (S=91.3% and Sp=91.9%) for 4 to 7 years, and 13 for those with > or =8 years (S=82.6% and Sp=100.0%).

The present study aimed to modify and assess the reliability and validity of the modified IQCODE consisting of 32 items. The study consisted of two methods of assessing dementia: DSMIV diagnosis carried out by clinicians, and informants responding to the IQCODE. The subjects were 200 pairs of elderly subjects and their informants who visited the Geriatric Clinic, Ramathibodi Hospital. The optimal cutoff score on the modified IQCODE was 3.42, with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and accuracy were 0.94, 0.90, and 0.92, respectively. The IQCODE items had high internal consistency. The IQCODE associated with the elderly person's age, but not with their gender and educational level; nor were they associated with the demographic characteristics of the informant. Therefore, the IQCODE could be used as an alternative screening test for dementia in Thailand with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. This tool may be useful for dementia screening in the community and the geriatric clinic for early detection of disease."

A sample of 90 elderly subjects (31 with evidence of post-operative delirium), non-demented at baseline, was screened for cognitive decline and dementia. Diagnosis of dementia was highly associated with the occurrence of delirium. The relative risk for the diagnosis of dementia among subjects with previous history of delirium, according to the IQcode screening, was 10.5 (95% CI: 3.3-33.2). Such patients had a significantly higher mean IQcode score (3.75) as compared to controls (3.1; p < 0.001).

The study design was an age and gender matched case-control study. Seventy managed care members, 35 with dementia (cases) and 35 without dementia (controls), were assessed using BSCI embedded within a longer health assessment questionnaire commonly used in Medicare-managed care. A number of measures were used to examine validity of BSCI, including comparisons of the differences between cases and controls in BSCI scores, comparisons of the correlations between patient scores on BSCI and the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE, a common screening test for dementia) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS, a common dementia assessment test), and comparisons of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the three instruments. BSCI scores for cases and controls were significantly different, as were their scores for the MMSE and ADAS. Scores on BSCI were significantly correlated with scores for the MMSE and ADAS using both the Kendall's tau-b and Spearman rank-order correlation; correlations ranged from 0.654 between BSCI and ADAS to -0.83 for the correlation between BSCI and the MMSE (p < 0.001 for both). The areas under the ROC curves ranged from 0.94 to 0.96 for the three tests, meaning that they were equally accurate in discriminating between demented and nondemented patients. BSCI, a brief telephone screen for cognitive impairment due to dementia, discriminates between demented patients and normal controls as well as two standard tests of dementia, and may be considered a valid screen for dementia. Compared to existing screening tests, it has the additional advantages of extreme brevity, and ease of administration and scoring by lay interviewers via telephone. The use of brief screening instruments for dementia, such as the one validated here, will be increasingly important for the effective management of dementia and other chronic diseases where dementia is a coexisting condition."

None had a history of dementia. They were tested on the Moray House Test of verbal reasoning at age 11 in 1932 and at age 79 between 1999 and 2001. At age 79 they also took tests of non-verbal reasoning, short- and long-term verbal declarative memory, Verbal Fluency, and a short screening test for dementia. Subjects who possessed at least one copy of the NCSTN B haplotype (Hap B) had higher scores on the Moray House Test (a test principally of verbal reasoning) at age 11 (p=0.036) and age 79 (p=0.027). The effect of Hap B on cognition at age 79 was non-significant after adjusting for the effect at age 11. Therefore, the effect of Hap B in this sample is on the life-long stable trait of cognitive ability, and not on age-related cognitive change. The possibility that this result might be a selection effect was not supported by the samples being in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to the distribution of NCSTN genotypes."

Only a few studies have been published on prestroke dementia (PSD), none of which have investigated a consecutive stroke cohort in an Asian patient population. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and clinical correlates of PSD in Chinese stroke patients in Hong Kong. Close and reliable informants of 289 stroke patients who were consecutively admitted to the medical wards of a university-affiliated regional hospital completed the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) within 1 week after their relative's admission. The presence of PSD was defined as an average IQCODE score of >or= 4.00. In addition, a wide range of demographic and clinical variables were examined and recorded.Twenty-two participants (7.6%) had PSD. The frequency of PSD in the group of subjects (n = 73) who were assessed within 48 hours after their admission was 12.3%. Univariate analysis found that PSD was associated with age, marital status, atrial fibrillation (AF), previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA), leukoaraiosis, and cerebral atrophy index (CAI). Multivariate logistic regression suggested that CAI, age, AF, and past TIA were independent risk factors for PSD. The low prevalence of PSD in Chinese patients in comparison with their Caucasian counterparts may be due to the difference in the time frame of the assessment. Comparative studies involving both Caucasian and Chinese stroke patients are required to further explore the role of AF and TIA in the development of PSD in both Chinese and Caucasian patients."

Cognitive variables included selected subtests from the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales (SENAS; Mungas et al., 2000): Verbal Memory, Object Naming, Verbal Attention Span, Verbal Conceptual Thinking, and Pattern Recognition. The association between the IQCODE and selected neuroimaging variables, hippocampal volume and white matter hyperintensity, was evaluated in a subsample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic individuals. The cognitive variables showed strong bivariate relationships with the IQCODE, although only Verbal Memory and Object Naming independently predicted level of functional ability. Verbal Memory was the strongest predictor of functional status, accounting for 23% of the variance in the IQCODE. White matter hyperintensity was also independently related to the IQCODE, accounting for 18% of the variance. Hippocampal volume was related to the IQCODE in a simple bivariate analysis, but was not an independent predictor of reported functional status after controlling for age. The relationships between cognitive variables and functional status, as well as between the imaging variables and the IQCODE, did not differ across language-ethnic groups."

However, this method may be imprecise and inefficient in the predictive power of the score for dementia. We propose a latent variable model approach for the scoring and item selection of such tests. We model the item responses to be random variables based on latent variables. We also model the disease outcomes to be a function of the latent variables. Maximum likelihood estimates are obtained by maximizing the joint likelihood functions of disease and the item responses over a specified distribution function for the latent variables. Variances of model parameters are estimated using a nonparametric bootstrap method. We illustrate the approach using a screening test for dementia from a community-based study."

The scale was tested for content validity by a group of seven experts in the field of delirium. Internal consistency, predictive validity, and concurrent and construct validity were tested in two prospective studies with high risk groups of patients: geriatric medicine patients and elderly hip fracture patients. Among the patients admitted to a geriatric department (N = 82), 4 became delirious; among the elderly hip fracture patients (N = 92), 18 became delirious. The DOS scale was determined to be content valid and showed high internal consistency, alpha = 0.93 and alpha = 0.96. Predictive validity against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV diagnosis of delirium made by a geriatrician was good in both studies. Correlations of the DOS scale with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were Rs -0.79 (p < or = 0.001) in the hip fracture patients and Rs -0.66 (p < or = 0.001) in the geriatric medicine patients. Concurrent validity, as tested by comparison of the research nurse's ratings of the DOS scale and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), for the group of hip fracture patients was 0.63 (p < or = 0.001). Construct validity of the DOS was tested against the Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline in Elderly (IQCODE), a preexisting psychiatric diagnosis and the Barthel Index. Correlation with the IQCODE was 0.74 (p < or = 0.001) in the study with the hip fracture patients and 0.33 (p < or = 0.05) in the study with the geriatric medicine patients. Correlation with the Barthel Index was -0.26 (p < or = 0.05) in the geriatric medicine patients and -0.55 (p < or = 0.001) in the hip fracture patients.

CD010771,0,12527986,0,Influence of prestroke dementia on early and delayed mortality in stroke patients.,"Causes of early and delayed death after stroke differ. It has been suggested that delayed mortality rate was increased in patients with post-stroke dementia. Prestroke dementia is frequent: its influence on survival in stroke patients has never been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of prestroke dementia on early and delayed mortality rate after stroke. In a cohort of 202 consecutive stroke patients aged >or= 40 years admitted between November 1995 and May 1996 in a primary care center, the prevalence of prestroke dementia was determined using the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) with a cut-off of 104. Patients were followed-up for 3 years. Statistics were performed using life-table methods. Of 202 patients, 33 had prestroke dementia. Of 142 survivors at month-6, 44 were demented, of them 15 having prestroke and 29 new-onset post-stroke dementia. No patient was lost to follow-up. The risk of death at month-6 was higher in patients with prestroke dementia (RR 2.7; 95 % CI: 1.6-4.8). However, independent predictors of early death were age, severity of the deficit at admission, type and etiology of stroke. The risk of delayed death was higher in patients with prestroke dementia (RR 4.97; 95 % CI: 1.76-13.98) as in patients with new-onset post-stroke dementia (RR 6.24; 95 % CI: 2.67-14.57), compared with non-demented patients. The mortality rate did not differ between patients with prestroke and new-onset post-stroke dementia. Dementia at month-6 was an independent predictor of delayed death (RR 5.7; 95 % CI: 2.4-13.4), with age and stroke recurrence. Causes of death did not differ between demented and non-demented patients. Dementia adversely influences vital outcome in stroke patients, perhaps partly because the therapeutic approach differs between demented and non-demented patients."

The only exception was graphical copying of two- or three-dimensional geometric designs, where education explained 6.25% of the variance in copying accuracy. The more education participants had (from incomplete or complete primary education, through extended primary education, lower technical and vocational training, and secondary to higher education), the better their copying performance was. There was however one exception, in that participants with secondary education copied designs significantly less accurately than participants with lower technical and vocational training. Differences in copying accuracy of subjects with higher versus lower educational attainment were largest for participants matched for high levels of cognitive function. More severe cognitive impairment attenuated education effects. Higher education did not protect against decline of copying performance as a consequence of increasing cognitive impairment. For each of three educational levels, premorbid copying performance was estimated by constructing a regression equation using an independent measure of cognitive functioning (in terms of visual recognition memory, orientation and category fluency) as the predictor variable. The results support the clinical utility of controlling for educational level when interpreting individual copying performance."

In contrast, the criteria of the NINCDS-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA) emphasize memory loss as the main feature to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) from VaD and from other forms of dementia. Moreover, CVD may precipitate the clinical expression of AD. Although no criteria have been created specifically for patients having AD with CVD, the ischemic score, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly and a history of prestroke mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be useful for identifying patients with this mixed form of dementia."

Patients were also evaluated using the Mini-mental State Exam (MMSE), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Kohs Block Design, and word fluency. CD was scored using the Shulman method. CD scores showed a high interrater reliability (r = 0.97). CD by non-demented subjects was essentially normal. As a screening test for Alzheimer disease (AD, mean MMSE = 18.0), CD had a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 96.7%. However, four of eight AD patients who showed normal MMSE score (> or = 24) drew abnormal clocks. CD scores in dementia were significantly correlated with performance on the Block Design (r = 0.68), MMSE (r = 0.56), and the Mental Control subtest in the WMS (r = 0.58). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that performance on the MMSE and the Block Design explain 53.8% of the variance in the CD scores. These findings indicate that low CD score by the Shulman method may be reflective of a constructional disability and general severity of dementia. CD is not so sensitive as the result of the original report when the patient group includes milder cases of AD. CD is, however, an efficient screening test for detecting and following the patients with dementia, especially combined with the MMSE."

CD010771,0,10939786,0,Blood pressure reduction and risk of dementia in patients with stroke: rationale of the dementia assessment in PROGRESS (Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study). PROGRESS Management Committee.,"High blood pressure is a known risk factor for multi-infarct dementia, a subtype of dementia caused by the occurrence of several strokes. However, this form of dementia is relatively uncommon and the influence of blood pressure on the risk of other subtypes of vascular dementia remains to be clarified. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that vascular risk factors could also play a part in Alzheimer's disease. One of the aims of Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) is to test the hypothesis that blood pressure decreasing treatment based on perindopril would reduce the incidence of dementia among patients with cerebrovascular disease. The dementia procedures in PROGRESS involve a classical two-phase design, with an initial screening phase based mainly on the Mini-Mental State Examination - a simple, brief, and widely used screening test for dementia. The second phase involves a diagnostic assessment for dementia in individuals screened as positive according to the criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed.). In this project, two other domains of the relationship between vascular risk factors and cognition are being explored in relation to PROGRESS substudies. The apolipoprotein E polymorphism, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, is being determined in each patient, as part of the genetic substudy. This will allow study of the relationship between this polymorphism and blood pressure, and of the effect of blood pressure decreasing treatment on the risk of dementia. The magnetic resistance imaging substudy will improve understanding of the relationship between blood pressure decreasing and the occurrence of cerebral white matter lesions, which are known to be related to cognitive decline and dementia."
CD010771,0,10921301,0,[Simple screening test for dementia in elderly persons the time and charge test].,"Dementia, with its associated morbidity and mortality, has emerged as a leading public health problem with elderly persons and its early detection is of obrious importance for treatment in curable cases and referral of patients to optimal medical facilities with education support for family members. While the precision of detecting demented subjects by the existing screening methods has improved in recent years, they are still complex and time consuming in practice and therefore difficult to use. We have developed an screening method adapted for Japanese based on ""The Time and Charge Test"" of Froehlich and coworkers. The time test evaluates the understanding of clock hands indicating 11:10, and the charge test the ability selecting 100 yen from a group of coins consisting of one 50-yen coin, seven 10-yen coins and seven 5-yen coins. This test was conducted on 40 persons (two out of whom dropped out) living in Roken facility (a health facility for the elderly) and another 40 visiting a day care center for the elderly. The test results were studied using Mini-Mental State Examination and Hasegawa's Dementia Scale-revised version. The sensitivity of our test was 49.1%, the specificity 95.2%, the negative predictive value 40.8%, and the positive predictive value 96.6%. When a time limit 5 seconds for completing the task for the time test and 20 seconds for the charge test, the sensitivity was 87.7%, the specificity 57.1% the negative predictive value 63.2%, and the positive predictive value 84.7%. As for reproducibility, test-retest gave a value of 85.0%, and the inter-observer agreement was 89.5%. This simple method thus appears useful for screening for dementia."

CD010771,0,10818539,0,Relevance of white matter changes to pre- and poststroke dementia.,"White matter changes are often associated with stroke, risk factors for stroke, and dementia. From a theoretical point of view, they may be associated with an increased risk of pre- or poststroke dementia because (i) they are linked with subtle cognitive decline, which may add to the consequences of the stroke lesions and of associated Alzheimer pathology; and (ii) they indicate an increased risk of stroke recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of white matter changes to pre- and poststroke dementia. The relationship between preexisting dementia and white matter changes was evaluated in the Lille stroke-dementia cohort. We assessed the cognitive functioning prior to stroke in 202 consecutive patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, by means of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). We classified in the dementia group patients with IQCODE scores of 104 or more. White matter changes were rated on CT with the Blennow's rating scale. Thirty-three of 202 patients were demented before stroke (16.3%; 95% confidence interval: 11.2-21.4); the logistic regression analysis found that female sex, family dementia, white matter changes, and cerebral atrophy were independently associated with prestroke dementia. White matter changes were also associated with an increased risk of poststroke dementia, 2 years after stroke onset. Thus, white matter changes contribute to dementia occurring in stroke patients."

The subjects were subsequently examined using a standardized diagnostic assessment protocol. Using the method of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the main outcome measure was area under the ROC curve (AUC). The overall AUC estimates were 0.956 (95% confidence interval 0.943-0.968) for the 3MS/IQCODE and 0.945 (0.931-0.960) for the DQ. After adjustment for age, the efficiency of the both 3MS/IQCODE and the DQ was better for subjects with genotype epsilon4/epsilon4 at APOE, better among women, and better in those with two or more years duration of dementia. The optimal threshold for this two-stage screen yielded sensitivity and specificity estimates of 91.0% and 92.0%, respectively."
CD010771,0,10773648,0,Correlates of informant-rated cognitive decline after stroke.,"Cognitive impairment is common after stroke, but measurement is problematic. Six tests of mental ability, unaffected by loss of limb function, were administered to 49 subjects of mean age 74.2 years at a median of 4.3 years (range 0.1-16.8) after stroke together with a depression score and the IQCODE, an informant-rated scale of estimated cognitive decline. Over 90% of stroke patients were able to complete most tests. IQCODE correlated significantly with the HADS depression score (r = 0.35, p = 0.040), the 2-year Barthel score (r = -0.60, p = 0.001) and with a general cognitive factor extracted from the mental ability test scores (r = -0.42, p = 0.016).

From the Adult Health Study (AHS) population of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, 2052 men and women aged 60 or over and living in Hiroshima were evaluated for their cognitive functions using the CASI. Dementia was diagnosed in 93 and 1,959 were considered not to suffer from dementia based on the DSM-III-R criteria using neurological examination and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) completed by caregivers. Multivariate regression analysis not only indicated that total score was higher with lower age and higher education but that the slope of its decrease is steeper with higher age and fewer years of education. The slope of score decrease with increase of age was steeper for women than for men. Furthermore, CASI items were categorized by domains of cognitive function. Multivariate regression analysis for each cognitive domain showed clear effects of age and level of education. The effect of age for the nondementia subjects was large in cognitive domains dealing with temporal orientation, short-term memory, and list-generating fluency. The most useful cognitive domains for diagnosing dementia were temporal orientation, short-term memory, and list-generating fluency, as was indicated by high sensitivity and specificity."

Principal components analysis showed that CST and ADS6-scores had relatively high loadings on one factor, in contrast to digit span scores that loaded on a second factor. On average, psychiatric patients did hardly worse than normal controls. Attention deficits were more apparent in dementia patients. Considering a maximum of r = .41, these more or less subtle deficits were only moderately related to dementia screening test performance. It is concluded that the adapted Digit Span test is suitable for measuring attention deficits in elderly patients.

Secondary outcome measures were Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Deficit Scale (ADS) and CGIC by caregivers. Sixty-eight patients were included in an intent-to-treat analysis (48 active and 20 placebo); 56 patients had evaluable data at week 30 (36 active and 20 placebo). The results of the complete case analysis revealed a significant improvement in the CASI and MMSE scores of the active group in the 18th week (90 mg/day) and the 30th week (120 mg/day) (p < 0.01). In the intent-to-treat analysis, significant improvement of the active group was noted on CASI at week 30 (p = 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the measures of IQCODE, CGIC and ADS. The primary reasons for withdrawal of tacrine-treated patients (39 patients, 52%) were asymptomatic ALT elevation, anorexia and nausea/vomiting.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MTLA and its relation with pre-existing dementia.
CD010771,0,9472135,0,Psychometric evaluation of a measure of cognitive decline in elderly people with mental retardation.,"Forty elderly persons with mental retardation were assessed by their care providers on a modified version of the Short Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in The Elderly (IQCODE) an instrument designed to quantify cognitive decline in elderly people in the general population. They were also assessed for IQ, aberrant behavior, and current mental status; test-retest and interrater reliability were evaluated as well. Internal consistency, as assessed by coefficient alpha, was moderately high (alpha = .86). Test-retest reliability was mediocre and interrater reliability levels did not reach statistical significance. The Short IQCODE was not correlated with a variety of demographic features or with behavior ratings, showing evidence of divergent validity. However, the Short IQCODE was only weakly (nonsignificantly) correlated with a measure of current mental status, which challenges its concurrent validity. The Short IQCODE probably needs to be modified further for satisfactory psychometric performance in people with mental retardation. However, some features of this study may have resulted in suboptimal estimates of the Short IQCODE's psychometric characteristics."
CD010771,0,9526793,0,[Abbreviated form of the Informant Questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly].,"This study evaluated some psychometric qualities of the Dutch short form Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE-N). The score profile on the short form IQCODE-N was comparable in two outpatient populations. Short form and regular IQCODE-N are equivalent, as they were highly correlated (r = 0.97). However, using IQCODE-N cut-off scores the short form appeared to be more strict in defining 'decline'. A moderately high correlation was found between informant ratings and dementia screening tests CST (r = -0.47) and ADS (r = -0.46). Informant ratings were not influenced by patient's age or level of education. The short form IQCODE-N describes cognitive change in everyday activities of elderly patients and can be an efficient rating scale for clinical assessment of dementia."

CD010771,0,9291882,0,Comparison of two scoring systems of the Mini-Mental State Examination as a screening test for dementia.,"The difference in validity in detecting dementia of two different scoring systems (age- and education-adjusted versus raw scores) of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), was assessed in an epidemiological study on the prevalence of dementia. A second, independent, psychometric screening tool, the Milan Overall Dementia Assessment (MODA), was also used. A group of 829 subjects over age 59 took part in the study. Subjects scoring below the cut-off point of the MMSE and/or MODA were clinically evaluated. Clinical diagnoses were adopted as the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of the two tests were calculated. Our findings show that the correction for age and education of the raw score of the MMSE causes the loss of the mildest demented patients and heavily reduces the sensitivity of the screening test (from 85.7% to 71.4%), while it accounts for a moderate improvement in the specificity (from 90.0% to 96.3%). A possible explanation for this seeming paradox is proposed."
CD010771,0,9283925,1,Screening of dementia in community-dwelling elderly through informant report.,"Screening tools for cognitive decline still have low accuracy for dementia, mainly in cases of mild dementia. All of them are affected by factors such as age, sex, educational level, sensory deficits and several mental disorders. The information provided by a proxy close to the patient has been used during recent years in dementia diagnosis. Therefore, new questionnaires, which use standardized information from relatives, have been developed. The aim of this study was to validate a Spanish version (S-IQCODE) of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), a dementia screening questionnaire in Spanish population-based samples. A validity study of the screening tool was carried out in two population-based samples of community-dwelling elderly with different sociodemographic characteristics (urban and rural samples). Dementia diagnosis was performed by neurologists according to DSM-III-R criteria. The S-IQCODE showed a higher accuracy than the MMSE in both samples: sensitivity of 82% and 83% vs 73% and 83%, specificity of 90% and 83% vs 78% and 74%, accuracy of 89% and 83% vs 77% and 75%. Moreover, while the S-IQCODE did not have associations with any extraneous factors, the MMSE showed significant correlations with age (-0.51), educational level (0.62), mental health (-0.40), premorbid intelligence (0.67) and intellectual level (0.75). The results obtained with the S-IQCODE show that it could possibly be applied in screening for dementia in community-dwelling elderly."
CD010771,0,9178050,1,Differentiating between demented and psychiatric patients with the Dutch version of the IQCODE.,"This study presents psychometric data on the Dutch version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE-N). We focused on differentiating between inpatients with dementia or a mood/psychotic disorder. A cutoff point of 3.9 on the IQCODE-N correctly predicted group membership in 87.8% and 78.8% respectively. Internal consistency and principal component analysis suggest that the IQCODE-N measures a unidimensional construct. Correlations with a Dementia Screening Test (r = 0.62), nurses' observations on memory disorders (r = 0.71) and a global assessment of severity of dementia (r = 0.72) support the validity of the informant ratings. Patients' age and level of education did not confound informant ratings. Only a small fraction of the informants could not complete the IQCODE-N, which makes it an easily applicable rating scale for cognitive decline."

CD010771,0,9071438,0,"Application of a Spanish version of the ""Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly"" in the clinical assessment of dementia.","We studied the validity of a complete (S-IQCODE) and a shortened (SS- IQCODE) Spanish version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) for the diagnosis of dementia in a clinical setting. Fifty-three consecutive outpatients were assessed with an extensive workup and followed up for 6 months in a specialized clinic for the diagnosis and management of dementia. Thirty eight (71%) were finally diagnosed as demented. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) had a slightly greater diagnostic power than did the S-IQCODE and the SS-IQCODE (sensitivity 89% vs. 84% and 79%; specificity 80% vs. 73% for both; positive predictive value 92% vs. 89% and 88%; negative predictive value 75% vs. 65% and 58%), but without statistical significance. Both the S-IQCODE and SS-IQCODE were independent of previous education of the patients. The best diagnostic results were obtained when the cognitive scores of the patient in the MMSE and the report of the relative in the S-IQCODE were simultaneously considered. We conclude that the IQCODE, in a complete as well as in a shortened form, is a good diagnostic instrument in the clinical setting that can enhance the validity of other cognitive tests."
CD010771,0,9063339,0,A 5-year longitudinal study of the Mini-Mental State Examination in normal aging.,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) measures global cognitive performance and is often used as a screening test for dementia. This paper presents a 5-year longitudinal study of the MMSE score in a sample of 2,537 non-demented French community residents aged 65 years and older who were participants in the Paquid Study in 1988-1992. Subjects were evaluated at the baseline visit (T0) and 1 year (T1), 3 years (T3), and 5 years (T5) later. Analyses performed with a random effects linear model showed that the score rose between T0 and T1 (by 0.60 points for subjects aged 65 years at T0 to 0.83 points for subjects aged 85 years at T0), then it decreased very slightly between T1 and T5 (by 0.02 points for subjects aged 65 years to 0.57 points for subjects aged 85 years). The improvement during the first year, which was larger for less educated subjects, may be explained by the stress due to the test situation at T0 or by a learning effect at T1. The decline during the last 4 years was more pronounced for older and less well educated subjects. The cross-sectional measure of age effect was larger than the longitudinal measure of time effect. This difference may be explained by a cohort effect or by a practice effect induced by repetition of the test. The authors conclude that the MMSE score declines very slightly in non-demented subjects, thus suggesting that the cognitive processes involved are spared by the aging process. These results may have implications for dementia screening."
CD010771,0,9050430,0,The psychogeriatric assessment scales (PAS): further data on psychometric properties and validity from a longitudinal study of the elderly.,"The PAS is a standardized interview which assesses the changes seen in dementia and depression using a set of scales. There are three scales derived from an interview with the subject (cognitive impairment, depression, stroke) and three from an interview with an informant (cognitive decline, behaviour change, stroke). The aim was to provide data on the psychometric properties and validity of the PAS. The scales were originally developed using data from the first wave of a longitudinal study of the elderly. Reported here are further data on the PAS from the second wave of the same study, carried out 3 1/2 years later. The setting was a community survey carried out in the Australian city of Canberra. Seven hundred and nine elderly persons, with a mean age of 80 years, and 641 informants participated. Besides the PAS, participants were administered several other scales: the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, the National Adult Reading Test and the Goldberg anxiety and depression scales. Diagnoses of dementia and depression were made with the Canberra Interview for the Elderly, from which the PAS is derived. Confirmatory factor analysis replicated the five-factor model which underpins the PAS. The PAS was found to correlate with the other scales having similar content and showed correspondence with diagnoses of dementia and depression derived from the Canberra Interview for the Elderly. Longitudinal data supported the validity of the cognitive decline scale as a measure of change. Overall, the results support the original psychometric and validity research on the PAS."

The analysis suggested that there were significant correlations between amyloid precursor protein and cognitive decline as assessed by the IQCODE. Preliminary investigations of Down syndrome suggest amyloid precursor protein levels are associated with duration of dementia in the group. The findings imply circulating amyloid precursor protein has a more central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."

CD010771,0,8970013,0,The cognitive assessment screening test (CAST) for dementia.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness, the sensitivity, and the specificity of the Cognitive Assessment. Screening Test (CAST), a paper-and-pencil self-administered cognitive test designed to screen elderly people for possible dementia, for use in general physicians' offices, requiring little expertise or staff time. CAST consists of three parts: part A (relatively easy), part B (more demanding), and part C (self-report of concerns). CAST was administered in two studies to: (1) 19 patients known to be mildly to moderately demented versus 24 age-matched normal controls (to establish cutoff standards); and (2) a ""real world"" sample of 26 elderly patients not known to be demented, attending a general medicine clinic. The sensitivity and specificity of CAST were compared with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Blessed Dementia Scale cognitive portion (BDS-cog). In study 1, controls were given a detailed neuropsychological battery; in study 2, all patients were given the neuropsychological battery, which served as the ""gold standard"" to identify individuals with cognitive impairment. In study 1, the cutoff scores for dementia using CAST (Parts A and B) were established. CAST discriminated demented patients from controls with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 88%; the MMSE had a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 100%; and the BDS-cog had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96%. In study 2, CAST discriminated cognitive impairment with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 38% and a specificity of 100%; and the BDS-cog had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 94%. Part C was not used to discriminate demented from normal elderly individuals, but to screen for those concerned about their cognitive functioning. CAST is highly useful as a dementia screening test, with sensitivity and specificity equal to or better than the MMSE and BDS-cog, yet requiring minimal examiner time and little training or experience to administer."
CD010771,0,8908414,0,Sociodemographic predictors and concurrent validity of the Mini Mental State Examination and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale.,"The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) are among the most commonly used screening tests for dementia. The goals of our study were, firstly, to identify sociodemographic factors which may explain the variance of test results in a community sample and, secondly, to investigate the interrelationship of these two dementia screening tests in order to evaluate the concurrent validity. A total of 1947 subjects were investigated in the setting of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study (ASPS). Our study confirms most previous results demonstrating a relationship of higher dementia test scores with both younger age and higher educational level. Interestingly, the results we obtained suggest only a weak relationship and poor concurrent validity of the two tests. The total scores of the two tests show poor joint variance. This could lead to the conclusion that these tests evaluate different cognitive domains."

All 106 consecutive patients (71% female) of a psychogeriatric day care center were tested in two sessions. Their mean age was 77,7 (range 52-89). Taking the advised cutting-scores into account, we found consistent results for 74% of the patients (95%-confidence interval: 65%-82%): 60 patients were positive for dementia on both tests, and 18 were negative. For 28 patients the results were inconsistent, in that more patients scored in the impaired range for ADS3 than for CST14."

Informant-based assessment provides an alternative approach because informants can adopt a longitudinal perspective and directly rate cognitive change. A study was carried out to assess the validity of informant ratings collected by means of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). A community sample of 500 subjects aged 74 or over underwent four cognitive tests on two occasions 3 1/2 years apart. On the second occasion, informants filled out the IQCODE. Subjects rated as having moderate or severe decline were found to have greater change on the cognitive tests. These findings support the validity of informant ratings of cognitive decline."

The purpose of this study was to (1) develop a statistical correction for effects of age and education and (2) test the efficacy of the statistically adjusted MMS (MMSAdj) as a screening test for dementia using different ethnic groups and education levels. We used a population-base community survey sample (n=590) composed of 46.6% Hispanics and 53.4% non-Hispanics to derive the statistical correction, defined as:MMSAdj = Raw MMS - (0.471 X [Education-12]) + (0.131 X [Age-70]). Ethnicity and language of test administration were not significantly related to MMSAdj in the community survey sample, but the raw MMS was strongly influenced by these factors. We used an independent sample (n=2,983) of patients evaluated through the California Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers to test the diagnostic accuracy of the MMS and the MMSAdj across low- and high-education groups and across whites, Hispanics, and blacks. Results showed greater stability of sensitivity and specificity across education levels and ethnic groups for the MMSAdj than for the raw MMS and suggest that the MMSAdj is a preferable measure of cognitive impairment for low- education and minority individuals."

CD010771,0,8665726,0,[Word fluency in spinocerebellar degeneration].,"Two types of verbal fluency task-initial letter fluency and category (semantic) fluency--were examined in eleven patients with spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), twenty four patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and twenty control subjects without neurological signs and symptoms. All patients and subjects showed normal results from the screening test for dementia. The numbers of initial letter fluency were less than those of category fluency in all groups. For category fluency, patients with SCD or PD had significantly lower scores than controls. For initial letter fluency, patients with SCD produced significantly lower scores than controls, but patients with PD did not produce significantly lower scores than controls. It is considered that the poor performance on both initial letter and category fluency in patients with SCD or Pd was related to disturbance of semantic memory associated with subcortical impairment, and the poor performance on initial letter fluency in patients with SCD was caused by the initiation and retrieval problems based on disturbance of frontostriatal circuits and linguistic systems. Therefore, we suggested cerebellar hemisphere played a role on the order and timing of rule-based generation of letters."

Every participant was examined by a physician and was found to be free of dementia, stroke, and Parkinson's disease. Different from the standard procedures, only one-third of each odor pad was used for each subject, the four odor choices were presented orally for the majority of subjects, and they were not forced to make a selection when they could not detect or identify the odor. The average level of performance was 46% correct. The score was negatively associated with age, positively associated with education and with performance on a dementia screening test, and corroborated with subjects' report of smell deterioration in recent years. Nonsmokers and women performed better than smokers and men. The 12-item MODSIT had an internal consistency reliability of 0.73 and a 7-month retest stability of 0.57 with different examiners. The MODSIT is satisfactory for group studies, even when administered with suboptimal procedures such as those used in the present study."
CD010771,0,8563660,0,CAMCOG--a concise neuropsychological test to assist dementia diagnosis: socio-demographic determinants in an elderly population sample.,"The CAMCOG, which forms part of the CAMDEX interview (Roth et al., 1986, 1988), is a brief neuropsychological battery designed to assess the range of cognitive functions required for a diagnosis of dementia, and to detect mild degrees of cognitive impairment. It was administered to a population sample of 418 elderly people (aged 77 and above) in their place of residence. The data show that in contrast to the Mini-Mental State Examination, total CAMCOG scores are well distributed and there is no ceiling effect. Examination of the association between CAMCOG scores and socio-demographic variables (age, sex, education and social class) shows that each exerts a significant, and independent, effect upon performance. CAMCOG also includes a number of subscale which assess individual areas of cognitive function. Of the eight major subscales (orientation, language, memory, attention, praxis, calculation, abstract thinking, perception), age was significantly related to all but attention; sex with attention, praxis, calculation and perception; education with language and abstract thinking; and social class with language and perception. In all these analyses, the results were adjusted for the effects of the other socio-demographic variables using analysis of variance. However, education and social class are highly correlated variables and when the association with education is examined without adjusting for social class, attention and praxis are also found to be significantly related to education. Caution must therefore be taken when using the CAMCOG (or any other cognitive test) as a screening test for dementia, using a single, predetermined cutpoint. In general, the combination of brevity and breadth of the CAMCOG, along with its distributional properties, makes it an attractive neuropsychological test for use in the community or the clinic."
CD010771,0,7824143,1,The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) as a screening tool for dementia for a predominantly illiterate Chinese population.,"The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) provides ratings of an individual's changes in everyday cognitive functions during the previous 10 years. Original studies conducted in Australia showed that its score was not influenced by the subjects' educational backgrounds and that it performed at least as well as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a screening instrument for dementia. The subjects of the present study were Chinese and included 399 community residents and 61 dementia patients. Their ages ranged from 50 to 92 years; their education levels ranged from 0 to 19 years, and 63% of them had never attended school. We administered the IQCODE to informants and the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), from which a CASI-estimated score of the MMSE (MMSE-CE) can be obtained, to the subjects. The diagnosis of dementia was made independently by physicians according to the DSM-III-R criteria based on semistructured interview and testing, neurologic examination, and standardized assessments of cerebral vascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. The Chinese IQCODE showed no association with the subjects' education level or gender, low association with their age, and moderately high association with their MMSE-CE score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the IQCODE was significantly larger than that of the MMSE-CE for the whole group and for the subgroup with 1 to 19 years of education but not for the subgroup with 0 years of education. Nine of the 26 items of the IQCODE could be deleted without appreciable reduction in sensitivity and specificity. The IQCODE (1) can be shortened to 17 items, (2) had good cross-cultural applicability, and (3) was better than the MMSE-CE as a screening tool for dementia in a population with large variation in educational backgrounds."
CD010771,0,7662322,1,"The screening of mild dementia with a shortened Spanish version of the ""Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly"".","Most of the present screening tests for the detection of dementia fail with mild dementia. Jorm et al. recently presented the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), a simple instrument with good diagnostic validity that uses a close relative to obtain information on the cognitive decline of a patient. We used a Spanish adaptation of this questionnaire (S-IQCODE) validated in a population-based sample, and a shortened form (SS-IQCODE) obtained after analyzing the items and reducing them to only 17. The S-IQCODE and the SS-IQCODE have greater diagnostic validity for mild dementia than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (sensitivity: 86% for both versus 57%; specificity: 92 and 91% versus 84%, positive predictive value: 54 and 50% versus 29%; negative predictive value: 91 and 90% versus 81%) and, unlike the MMSE, are independent of the age, education, and previous intelligence of the subjects. According to the results of this study, the SS-IQCODE could be a useful screening test for the detection of mild dementia in the Spanish-speaking aged population, with greater diagnostic power and less contamination by independent variables than the MMSE."
CD010771,0,7629532,0,Relation between education and dementia: the role of test bias revisited.,"Several authors have suggested that dementia screening tests may be biased against low levels of education, whereas others find that a low level of education is a genuine risk factor for dementia. The present paper attempts to reconcile these conflicting views by examining item bias and test bias indices of the mini mental state examination (MMSE). Psychometric calculations and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses of sensitivity and specificity as performed by earlier studies were replicated and extended from the database of the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly. This is a population survey on cognitive decline and dementia (age range 65-84). Subjects with a low level of education (primary school) were compared with better educated subjects (at least some secondary education). Cases were matched by age and sex. The results indicate that the MMSE is not educationally biased as far as item characteristics, reliability, and construct validity are concerned. Yet its predictive validity as a screening test for dementia is educationally biased. This bias will effectively be eliminated with a two point higher cut off score for the subjects whose education extends beyond primary school. Even after such score correction, a low level of education probably remains a genuine risk factor for dementia."

All the inhabitants over 74 years of age in one area of Stockholm took the MMSE. The test was then compared to the clinical diagnosis of dementia. With a cut-off point of 23/24, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 92%, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 69%. Age, sex, and education did not substantially affect the specificity and the PPV, but had a slight effect on the sensitivity. The main causes of the false positives were somatic and psychiatric disorders. These results are in agreement with studies performed with similar methods and comparable populations."

The MMSE has been consistently found to correlate with education and, at the same time, education is regarded by some researchers as being of potential etiological significance for dementia. In the present study, results on the MMSE from a community-based study in Sweden were compared with two standards: the clinical diagnosis of dementia and the Katz index of daily living activities. For both these comparisons, education did not substantially change the predictive ability of the MMSE. Our data, when compared with previous studies, show that the influence of education on the predictive ability of the MMSE varies in different populations. We conclude that differential MMSE cut-off points for different educational levels or adjustment techniques for education are not universally applicable."

Using the MMSE as the standard, clock drawing had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 87%. Patients with discrepant scores were then further evaluated.

This pilot study demonstrates significant increases in the activity of plasma glutamate dehydrogenase and the plasma concentrations of aspartate, glutamate, and alpha-ketoglutarate in nursing home residents with previously diagnosed Alzheimer's disease when compared with that in other nursing home residents without Alzheimer's disease who had no complicating conditions. Plasma concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamine, and activities of plasma glutamate decarboxylase, glutaminase, and glutamine synthetase were not significantly different in the two groups. A discriminant analysis number, based on the four significantly different compounds, is obtained that may be used as the basis for an inexpensive, non-invasive, and accurate screening test for Alzheimer's disease."

In a survey dealing with cerebral aging, the MMSE administered 2,792 subjects aged 65 years and over, who continued to live at home. The total score decreased with age and increased markedly when the educational level rose. The proportion of failures was higher than or equal to 10% for 12 of the 30 MMSE items, including the 5 items designed to measure attention ability (serial subtractions) and the 3 ones exploring delayed memory. Regarding these 12 items, the percentage of failures increased homogeneously with age, but the relationship with educational level was heterogeneous: it was very strong for the calculation items, weaker for the delayed memory items. These results pointed to the complex relationships between MMSE scores and educational level, and suggested a possible bias related to the screening tool in dementia surveys."

Results suggest that despite differences in the content of the three instruments, they are equally discriminant. Methods involving direct cognitive examination were found to lose discriminability in relation to milder forms of dementia, whereas an informant questionnaire was found to perform equally as well on cases of mild and moderate dementia. The informant questionnaire was also found to produce lower refusal rates and to be less influenced by the place of residence of the elderly person. The problem of selecting cut-off points according to the range of predicted prevalence rates of dementia for the general population is also discussed."

We studied its properties for a population of French community residents, using a sample of 2,792 randomly selected subjects in Gironde, France. When the traditional cutoff point 23-24 was used, we observed a sensitivity of 1.0 and a specificity of 0.77. We sought to increase the specificity of the test, while keeping sensitivity at 1.0, with the use of logistic regression analysis. We found (1) a specificity of 0.81 when ""recall three objects"" and ""orientation to time"" were added to the Mini-Mental State Examination score; (2) a specificity of 0.90 when Benton's Visual Retention Tests and Isaacs' Set Test of Verbal Fluency were added to the Mini-Mental State Examination score and subscores; and (3) no improvement in specificity when age and educational level were included in the analyses."

Subjects were recruited from a nursing home. The ADS3 appeared to be a feasible instrument for the patient groups investigated here: 87.5% of the demented and non-demented patients were classified correctly. A combination of the ADS3 and the WMS-R led to a correct prediction of 97.5% of the individuals in the two groups investigated. Education appeared to have an effect on performance on the ADS3, whereas age and gender did not. As expected, a strong linear relationship between the ADS3 and the WMS-R was found. However, since data about reliability, validity and norms of the WMS-R are still under investigation, definite conclusions about the concurrent validity cannot be made yet."

Jorm et al have used recently a questionnaire (IQCODE) by which a subject's relative informs of the decline suffered by this in his cognitive capacity. In this work is showed a spanish adaptation of this test, the spanish-IQCODE, analysing it's usefulness for the detection of mild dementia. The S-IQCODE shows a diagnostic validity (sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 92%, positive predictive value of 54% and negative predictive value of 98%) greater than Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); it also shows a correlation with the diagnostic of dementia greater (r = 0.70 vs r = 0.37); and, different from MMSE, it doesn't show significative correlations with the age, the schooling and the premorbid intelligence. The results in this study show the S-IQCODE as a good test for the detection of the mild dementia, of greater diagnostic power than the MMSE and less contaminated than this by strange variables to the cognitive decline."

Dementia diagnoses were made by both a clinician and a research interview using a computer algorithm to meet DSM-III-R and ICD-10 (Draft) criteria. The IQCODE was found to perform at least as well as the MMSE against all diagnoses and significantly better when judged against the algorithmic ICD-10 diagnoses. Also, the IQCODE was found to be uncontaminated by pre-morbid ability as estimated from the National Adult Reading Test and to have very high test-retest reliability after a delay of a day or more."
CD010771,0,1885862,0,Effect of education on the mini-mental state examination as a screening test for dementia.,"We studied whether Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) norms for detecting dementia in elderly outpatients vary according to educational attainment. Subjects were 109 elderly outpatients with Alzheimer's dementia and 100 non-demented outpatient controls. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of the MMSE were examined among three strata of educational attainment: middle school, high school, and college/graduate school. MMSE ROC curve areas were .95-.96 in the three educational strata. Assuming a dementia prevalence of 10%-30%, the most accurate lower limits of normal for MMSE scores and their attendant sensitivities and specificities were 21 for middle school (.82/.94), 23 for high school (.79/.97), and 24 for college/graduate school (.83/1.00) attainment. These norms accurately classified over 90% of subjects in all three educational strata. We conclude that education-specific norms optimize performance of the MMSE as a screening test for Alzheimer's dementia in elderly outpatients."
CD010771,0,1776585,0,The prevalence of dementia in a total population: a comparison of two screening instruments.,"Two short screening tests for dementia, the Information/Orientation (IO) sub-test of the Clifton Assessment Scale (CAPE) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were included in a survey of 1579 elderly people of a large general practice. All those scoring 21 and under on the MMSE, a one in two sample of those scoring 22, 23 and a one in ten sample of the remainder were investigated further using the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the elderly (CAMDEX). The prevalences of moderate to severe dementia and mild to severe dementia determined from the CAMDEX interview were 4.8% and 14.2%, respectively. For detection of moderate to severe dementia, a cut-point of 21/22 on the MMSE gave a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 85% and an overall prevalence of 19.7%; mild to severe dementia was best detected by a cut-point of 23/24 giving a sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 81% and prevalence of 28.5%. A cut-point of 7/8 on the IO sub-test gave a sensitivity and specificity for detecting moderate to severe dementia of 87% and 97%, respectively, with a prevalence of 7.3%; for mild to severe dementia a cut-point of 10/11 gave a sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 94% and prevalence of 14.7%."
CD010771,0,2284389,0,The relationship between intellectual impairment and mood disorder in the first year after stroke.,"In a community-based study of patients with a first-ever stroke, intellectual impairment (as defined by scores on a common screening test for dementia, the Mini-Mental State Examination) was found in 26% at 1 month post-stroke, and in 21% at 6 and 12 month follow-up. Low scores on the screening test were associated with greater age, physical disability before the stroke, larger stroke lesion volumes as measured on CT scan, and non-stroke changes such as atrophy and white matter low attenuation on the CT scan. There was a negative correlation between scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination and symptom levels on two measures of mood disorder. However, there was no evidence of a specific relationship between major depression and low scores on the Mini-Mental State. We examined various aspects of the relationship between mood symptoms and low scores on the Mini-Mental State, but found no evidence to support the suggestion that this relationship represented an example of depressive pseudodementia. We discuss the significance of our findings for clinical psychiatry and neuropsychology."

CD010771,0,2807680,0,Cross-validation of a dementia screening test in a heterogeneous population.,Recognition of the increasing importance of early dementia screening for both research and clinical purposes has led to the development of numerous screening instruments. The most promising of these are based on neuropsychological measures which are able to focus on very specific cognitive functions. Of these tests the Iowa screening test is of particular interest to researchers and clinicians working with heterogenous populations or wishing to make cross-cultural comparisons as it is relatively culture-fair and does not assume literacy. A preliminary study of the performance of the Iowa in an Israeli sample of diverse ethnic origins and low education level suggests it to be a very sensitive measure even in such groups. The study also demonstrates the inadvisability of adopting item weights derived by multivariate statistical techniques from another population.
CD010771,0,2651606,0,Validity and reliability of auditory screening tests in demented and non-demented older adults.,"The validity and reliability of auditory screening tests were evaluated in 34 demented and 31 non-demented elderly outpatients. In reference to an audiometric gold standard (40-dB HL hearing loss in speech frequencies), 512-Hz and 1024-Hz tuning forks, finger rub, and whispered voice tests performed well (ROC curve areas = 0.82 to 0.94). Simultaneously high (greater than 0.80) sensitivities and specificities were achievable for all these tests in demented patients. In non-demented patients, however, only the whispered voice test achieved simultaneously high specificity and sensitivity. The most accurate rule for air conduction screening audiometry was the inability to hear greater than or equal to two of four 40-dB HL speech frequencies (sensitivity = 1.0, specificity = 0.75 in non-demented patients; sensitivity = 0.97, specificity = 0.74 in demented patients). Interobserver/test-retest reliability was generally high for tuning forks, finger rub, and whispered voice tests (range of intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.38 to 0.90), and was somewhat higher in demented than in non-demented patients. These results suggest that some of the simple, traditional methods of auditory screening may have considerable validity and reliability in demented and non-demented older adults."
CD010771,0,2642498,0,Instruments for screening for depression and dementia in a long-term care facility.,"The high prevalence of mental disorders such as depression and dementia in institutionalized elderly patients warrants screening for psychiatric diagnosis in patients newly admitted to long-term care facilities. The diagnostic accuracy of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was evaluated against a standardized psychiatric interview. The MMSE was found to be 81% sensitive and 83% specific in screening for dementia using a previously established cutpoint of less than 24/30 points. Adjusting MMSE scores for physical disabilities precluding completion of specific tasks on the MMSE did not significantly change the diagnostic accuracy of the test. The GDS was 47% sensitive and 75% specific in screening for depression using the suggested cutpoint of greater than 13/30 points. The MMSE was significantly correlated with functional status (r = 0.48, P = .0001), but not with the scores on the GDS or the clinical diagnosis of depression. The GDS did not correlate with functional status. In summary, the MMSE is a good screening test for dementia in institutionalized elderly, but the GDS is not sensitive for depression in this population."

The questionnaire aims to assess cognitive decline independent of pre-morbid ability. In the present study, the IQCODE was administered to a sample of 613 informants from the general population. In addition, the questionnaire was administered to informants of 309 dementing subjects who had filled it out one year previously. A principal components analysis, using the general population sample, confirmed that the IQCODE measures a general factor of cognitive decline. The questionnaire was found to have high internal reliability in the general population sample (alpha = 0.95) and reasonably high test-retest reliability over one year in the dementing sample (r = 0.75). The total IQCODE score, as well as each of the 26-items, was found to discriminate well between the general population and dementing samples. The correlation with education was quite small (r = -0.13), indicating that contamination by premorbid ability is not a problem."
CD010771,0,2560521,0,In vivo effects by estrone sulfate on the central nervous system-senile dementia (Alzheimer's type).,"Seven women with senile dementia-Alzheimer's type (SDAT) were treated with conjugated estrogen [main content: estrone sulfate (E1-S)], at a dose of 1.25 mg/day over a 6-week period. A New Screening Test for Dementia developed by Japanese National Institute of Mental Health (NS) and the scores of Hasegawa Scale for dementia (HS) were performed every 3 weeks. Six women showed improvements in NS (P less than 0.05) and 5 women showed improvements in HS. Untreated women with SDAT did not show any improvement. Serum E1-S was measured by a direct radioimmunoassay. Serum E1-S was 911 +/- 156 pg/ml in 7 women with SDAT and lower than that of 7 normal women (1020 +/- 216 pg/ml). Following the treatment, serum E1-S increased to a level of 21.1 +/- 8.1 ng/ml. Estrone and estradiol-17 beta also increased. The results suggest a possibility for the future clinical use of estrogen for senile dementia, after careful clinical research trials including the side effects."
CD010771,0,3368071,0,Screening for dementia by memory testing.,"Enhanced cued recall provides a simple and clinically useful memory test for identifying dementia in the elderly. Because this test induces semantic processing and coordinates encoding and retrieval for maximum recall, genuine memory deficits due to impairment of specific memory processes can be distinguished from apparent memory deficits due to use of inefficient strategies or impairment of other cognitive processes. Since genuine memory deficits in the elderly are usually associated with dementia, their identification is highly predictive of clinical dementia. The present study validates the use of enhanced cued recall as a screening test for dementia in 70 aged subjects. All but one person with a pure amnesia were correctly classified. Enhanced cued recall correctly classified 97% of the 120 subjects in this and the previous study. Enhanced cued recall shows learning not revealed by free recall, providing more accurate measurement of memory, and distinguishes demented from nondemented elderly more accurately than either free recall or recognition."

CD010771,0,3241463,0,A new screening test for dementia.,"The purpose of this study is to develop a new screening test for detecting the demented elderly in the early stage in communities. The test is easy to apply for consultation, guidance and care and is capable of administering differential diagnoses. Based on the 9 dementia rating scales used in Japan, Europe and the U.S., a new test was completed after investigating and modifying the design 5 times. The test consists of 20 items. This test was given to 203 subjects (59 males and 144 females) including normal elderly as well as those suspected of suffering from dementia. The internal consistency, reliability and validity were studied using clinical diagnoses (diagnostic criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III) and Karasawa's Criteria for Judging Senility), Hasegawa's Dementia Rating Scale and Mental Status Questionnaire (MSQ) as external criteria. The present test was confirmed to have sufficient effectiveness as the screening test for dementia."
CD010771,0,3660917,0,[Interdisciplinary research strategies in geriatric psychiatry--studies and results in dementia and depressed patients].,"Eighty-one patients (mean age: 66 +/- 9 years) who had been in gerontopsychiatric in-patient care were included in the study. As well as physical, psychiatric and neurological examinations, EEG, brain CT scanning and the determination of the Ischemic Scale were performed, in order to confirm the clinical diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), dementia of vascular type (DVT) or multi-infarct dementia (MID), and depression in old age, as based on the DSM III criteria. A comprehensive psychological test battery was administered, to one section of the subjects. Our results indicate that EEG and Ischemic Score can differentiate patients with DAT and DVT to a satisfactory degree, whereas CT findings and psychometric assessment were apt to confirm the overall diagnosis of dementia (DAT/DVT) and depression. Patients with dementia showed memory impairment to a greater extent than depressive patients, as could be proved by a memory test (Syndrom-Kurztest). However, a dementia screening test (Information-Memory-Concentration Test) could more accurately differentiate dementia and depression. The application of a comprehensive psychometric testing procedure did not prove to be an effective diagnostic tool in the assessment of various stages of dementia. Short dementia tests and rating scales seem to be appropriate to distinguish depression from dementia, especially in cases of mild to moderate dementia. In patients with very mild and insignificant organic brain disturbances these screening methods fall short of diagnostic validity. Beyond this, there is a current need for assessment instruments in the evaluation of alterations in personality and affectivity, such as are seen in depression."

The correlation and reliability of the Mini-Mental State Examination and the modified Blessed test.,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test (BOMC), a six-item derivative of the Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration Test, were each administered to 36 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In 24 patients, both tests were readministered a month later. The correlation between the MMSE and BOMC was -0.83 with a test-retest correlation of 0.89 (MMSE) and 0.77 (BOMC). Factor analysis indicated that the multiple MMSE cognitive components could be explained by two factors, which together accounted for 66% of the variance. These factors are conceptually similar to the components of the BOMC, and so may explain the substantial correlation between the two tests. Since these cognitive status tests seem to be equivalent for Alzheimer patients, the briefer measure (BOMC), which offers additional advantages, may be preferred."

These modifications are designed to sample a broader variety of cognitive functions, cover a wider range of difficulty levels, and enhance the reliability and the validity of the scores. The 3MS retains the brevity, ease of administration, and objective scoring of the MMS but broadens the range of scores from 0-30 to 0-100. Greater sensitivities of the 3MS over the MMS are demonstrated with the pentagon item drawn by 249 patients. A summary form for administration and scoring that can generate both the MMS and the 3MS scores is provided so that the examiner can maintain continuity with existing data and can obtain a more informative assessment."

The validity of the SPMSQ was evaluated in a random sample of 119 community residents and 282 consecutively admitted medical inpatients. The SPMSQ proved to be a sensitive and specific screening test for moderate to severe dementia both in the community and hospital. Using the cut-off point (number of errors accepted) of three errors, the sensitivity of the test was 86.2% and the specificity 99.0% among medical inpatients. The percentages in the community sample were 66.7% and 100%, respectively. The validity of the SPMSQ was not as good for delirium because of its variable clinical picture. For screening purposes lower cut-off points than previously recommended should be used: three errors for dementia and two errors for delirium. Among Finnish elderly people it was not necessary to use correction for education in the SPMSQ."

Most of the studies well support the validity of the IQCODE in dementia screening, but the sensitivity of the rating scale at the early stage during the course of dementia is limited. In this study, we investigate the utility of the IQCODE for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the discriminative power of the IQCODE in patients having MCI with and without functional impairment. The samples included mild Alzheimer disease (AD, N=280), MCI ([N=657], further divided into 2 subgroups: patients with MCI having functional impairment [MCI-fi, N=357] and patients having MCI without functional impairment [MCI-fn, N=300]), and normal cognition (NC, N=274). The IQCODE, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and other neuropsychological tests were administered to all participants. Logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic ability of the IQCODE, compared to the MMSE. The optimal cutoff scores of the IQCODE were 3.19 for the MCI (sensitivity/specificity: 0.979/0.714) and MCI-fn (0.900/0.817), 3.25 for the MCI-fi (0.978/0.701), and 3.31 for mild AD (0.893/0.779), while the MMSE was identical, that is 26, for both MCI and its functional normal and functional impaired subgroups (0.892/0.755, 0.867/0.745, and 0.913/0.745, respectively) and 24 for mild AD (0.807/0.836). The discriminating accuracy of the IQCODE was slightly superior to that of the MMSE but did not reach statistical significance. Our study suggests that the IQCODE might be useful in screening for MCI, with hierarchical scores indicating functional normal or impaired."

The aim of this study was to estimate dementia prevalence in a community sample in Ribeir√£o Preto, Brazil, and to evaluate its distribution across several socio-demographic and clinical characteristics and habits. The population was aged 60 years and older and a representative sample from three different social regions. The screening instruments used in the first phase were the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Fuld Object-Memory Evaluation, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, and the Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale. In the second phase, the Cambridge Examination was employed to diagnose dementia according to the DSM-IV criteria. The estimate of dementia prevalence was adjusted for screening instrument performance, using the positive and negative predictive values. The data were weighted to compare frequencies, considering the sampling and the non-response effect, and subjected to multivariate analysis. In all, 1.145 elderly subjects were evaluated (mean age: 70.9 years), of whom 63.4% were female and 52.8% had up to 4 years of schooling (participation rates at the first and the second phases were 62.6 and 60%, respectively). The observed and estimated prevalences of dementia were 5.9% and 12.5%, respectively (n = 68). Alzheimer's disease was the main cause (60.3%). Dementia was associated with old age, low education, stroke, absence of arthritis, and not reading books. The estimated prevalence of dementia was higher than the prevalence previously found.

CD010771,0,21626569,0,Subtle cognitive impairment in elders with Mini-Mental State Examination scores within the 'normal' range.,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is commonly used as a screening test for dementia, yet MMSE scores above the cut-off for dementia (24-30) are widely thought to have limited utility, particularly in older persons. The study investigates whether scores within this range can be indicative of pre-symptomatic levels of cognitive impairment."
CD010771,0,21399482,0,Racial differences in the recognition of cognitive dysfunction in older persons.,"We assessed the influence of race and education on informants' reports of cognitive decline in 252 community-residing older persons who were receiving services from senior health agencies. An expert consensus panel made diagnoses of normal cognition, cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), and dementia based on clinical evaluations and standardized neuropsychological testing (using both population and race-adjusted norms). Informants were interviewed using the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Informants of black participants with CIND reported less cognitive decline (lower IQCODE scores) than informants of white CIND participants [3.03 (0.61) vs. 3.23 (0.41); t (117)=2.12, P‚â§0.036] even though there were no significant differences in the participants' functional and neuropsychological impairments. An analysis of covariance which controlled for informant education indicated that this difference in IQCODE scores was attributable to the fact that black informants had fewer years of education than white informants. There was no statistically significant difference in IQCODE scores for black and white participants with dementia [4.0 (0.7) vs. 4.3 (0.7); t (67)=1.37, P=0.177]. We conclude that racially determined differences in perceptions of early cognitive decline and education may influence informant ratings of older persons. These differences may contribute to disparities in the detection and treatment of cognitive disorders in older black persons."
CD010771,0,22882809,0,An informant questionnaire for detecting Alzheimer's disease: are some items better than others?,"A decline in everyday cognitive functioning is important for diagnosing dementia. Informant questionnaires, such as the informant questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly (IQCODE), are used to measure this. Previously, conflicting results on the IQCODEs ability to discriminate between Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively healthy elderly were found. We aim to investigate whether specific groups of items are more useful than others in discriminating between these patient groups. Informants of 180 AD, 59 MCI, and 89 patients with subjective memory complaints (SMC) completed the IQCODE. To investigate the grouping of questionnaire items, we used a two-dimensional graded response model (GRM).The association between IQCODE, age, gender, education, and diagnosis was modeled using structural equation modeling. The GRM with two groups of items fitted better than the unidimensional model. However, the high correlation between the dimensions (r=.90) suggested unidimensionality. The structural model showed that the IQCODE was able to differentiate between all patient groups. The IQCODE can be considered as unidimensional and as a useful addition to diagnostic screening in a memory clinic setting, as it was able to distinguish between AD, MCI, and SMC and was not influenced by gender or education."
CD010771,0,22086219,0,The Cognitive Change in Women study (CCW): informant ratings of cognitive change but not self-ratings are associated with neuropsychological performance over 3 years.,"The value of self-reported memory complaints for identifying or predicting future cognitive decline or dementia is controversial, but observations from a third party, or ""informant,"" may prove more useful. The relationship between Informant and Self-ratings of cognitive status and neuropsychological test scores was examined in a cohort of 384 nondemented, community-dwelling women, aged 60 years and older, participating in a single-site Women's Health Initiative ancillary study. Each participant and her respective informant separately completed the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Participants also underwent neuropsychological testing and responded to questionnaires on depression and functioning in complex activities of daily living. All neuropsychological test scores were significantly correlated (P values <0.05 to <0.01) with IQCODE ratings whereas Self-ratings overestimated cognitive functioning in some domains. Furthermore, the Self and Informant ratings were both positively correlated with depression and negatively correlated with participants' activity level. Therefore, informant judgments of functional abilities are robust predictors of cognitive status in high functioning nondemented women. These results suggest that informants may be sensitive to changes that are not clinically significant but that may represent an incipient trend for decline."

CD010771,0,21908910,0,Measuring memory in large group settings using a continuous recognition test.,"Memory function generally deteriorates with age, and memory impairments are a common symptom of serious illness such as dementia. Although screening tests are widely used throughout Medicine, they are not yet commonly used to detect memory impairments. The objective of this study was to characterize an audience-based memory test suitable for administration to a large number of individuals simultaneously. A continuous recognition test was developed to assess memory function in audiences using a slide-show in which 50 images were presented, of which 25 were repeated. Audience members responded by recording if an image was a repetition. The test was administered to a total of 1018 participants at 25 sites with an average audience size of 41 individuals (range = 9-142). A total of 868 individuals aged 40-97 y completed the test appropriately and provided their age, education level, and gender. Recognition memory as measured by discriminability (d') showed a significant decline with age (40-49 y old, d' = 3.51; 90-99 y old, d' = 1.95, p < 0.001) together with a greater than three-fold increase in variability. Individuals with less than 13 y of education had lower scores than those with more education (d' = 2.13 vs. 2.88, respectively, p < 0.001). These results are consistent with the known effects of age and education on memory. There were no significant effects of gender on test performance. Such memory tests represent a practical and novel approach to screen for the signs of early dementia."
CD010771,0,21903447,0,Decreased cognitive functioning in patients with advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Cognitive impairment causes a delay in diagnosis and treatment of the various cancer entities, resulting in reduced surgical outcomes and patient survival. However, no investigations have been carried out as to whether an association exists between cognitive functioning and tumour size in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, 46 patients with OSCC were evaluated by using a screening test for dementia, consisting of a combination of the mini-mental state examination and the clock test (81% sensitivity and 90% specificity). Test scores were correlated with tumour size according to the TNM staging system, which was categorized as being either limited (T1, T2; n=24) or advanced (T3, T4; n=22). No difference in age (P=0.172), sex (P=0.330), the percentage of drinkers (P=0.090) or the percentage of smokers (P=0.484) was evident between the groups. Patients with advanced tumour size scored significantly lower (median 5.5 of 9 possible points) when compared with those having tumours of a limited size (median 9 of 9 possible points; P=0.005). The median score of patients with T3/T4 tumours suggested the need for comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations for dementia. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the correlation of reduced cognitive functioning in patients with advanced OSCC. As a consequence, instructions for the identification of early signs and of symptoms of oral cancer are strongly recommended for relatives and nursing staff of patients with cognitive impairment. Such patients might need immediate treatment for oral cancer but might not be able to understand the significance of their symptoms and therefore present late, often too late."
CD010771,0,21856971,0,The IQCODE versus a single-item informant measure to discriminate between cognitively intact individuals and individuals with dementia or cognitive impairment.,"The present study evaluated the short Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE 2-year version) against a single item concerning informant's perception of patient's memory, as screening tools for CIND not dementia (CIND) and dementia. Data were drawn from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study, which is a national study that was specifically designed to provide population-based estimates of cognitive impairment and dementia in the United States. The study employed a comprehensive dementia evaluation that yielded an expert consensus-based diagnosis. Receiver-operating curves, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value were calculated. Both the IQCODE and the single-item instrument demonstrated only mild-to-moderate abilities to discriminate between cognitively intact individuals and individuals with CIND. Whereas the ability of the IQCODE to discriminate between cognitively intact individuals and individuals with dementia was moderate, the single-item instrument showed an adequate ability to distinguish between cognitively intact individuals and individuals with dementia. Therefore, for screening purposes, asking informants a single question concerning patients' memory is sufficient. However, if additional data concerning patients' strengths and weaknesses are needed, the IQCODE may be desirable."

The MMSE and the Braztel-MMSE were applied to 66 AD patients and 67 healthy elderly participants. The test-retest reliability was strong and significant (r = .92, p = .01), and the correlation between the Braztel-MMSE and the MMSE were significant (p = .01) and strong (r = .92). The general screening ability of the Braztel-MMSE was high (AUC = 0.982; CI95% = 0.964-1.001).

Although both are associated with cognitive impairment, no study has focused on pre-existing dementia in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. Therefore, we aimed to determine prevalence and mechanisms of pre-existing dementia in a large cohort of patients with an intracerebral haemorrhage. In a cohort of 417 patients, we evaluated the cognitive status before intracerebral haemorrhage with the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. The cut-off to diagnose cognitive impairment with no dementia was 53 and 64 for pre-existing dementia. We determined factors associated with pre-existing dementia in multivariate analyses in the overall cohort and among patients with lobar only or deep only intracerebral haemorrhages. We performed post-mortem examinations when possible. Of 417 patients (median age 72 years, interquartile range 58-79), 58 (14%; 95% CI 11-18%) patients had cognitive impairment with no dementia and 65 had pre-existing dementia (16%; 95% CI 12-19%). In lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, the prevalence was 23%, and factors associated with pre-existing dementia were increasing age (odds ratio: 1.09 per year; 95% CI 1.02-1.15), having <8 years of education (odds ratio: 8.37; 95% CI 1.91-36.65) and increasing cortical atrophy (odds ratio: 3.34 per step; 95% CI 1.40-7.96). The five autopsied patients had Alzheimer's disease with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In deep intracerebral haemorrhage, factors associated with pre-existing dementia were presence of old territorial vascular lesions (odds ratio: 4.52; 95% CI 1.18-17.42) and increasing severity of leucoaraiosis (odds ratio: 4.11 per step; 95% CI 1.73-9.75); the autopsied patient had small-vessel disease without Alzheimer's disease. These findings support the fact that pre-existing dementia is frequent in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and may be the consequence of two different mechanisms: neurodegeneration with Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in lobar intracerebral haemorrhage versus vascular process in deep intracerebral haemorrhage. These findings may contribute to the improvement of prevention and management of patients with intracerebral haemorrhages."

CD010771,0,20823087,0,Relationship of dementia screening tests with biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"Screening tests for Alzheimer's disease lack sensitivity and specificity. We developed the AD8, a brief dementia screening interview validated against clinical and cognitive evaluations, as an improvement over current screening methods. Because insufficient follow-up has occurred to validate the AD8 against the neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer's disease, we investigated whether AD8 scores correspond to impairment in episodic memory testing and changes in biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (cerebrospinal fluid and amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh compound B) characteristic of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. We also compared informant-based assessments with brief performance-based dementia screening measurements such as the Mini Mental State Exam. The sample (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ257) had a mean age of 75.4 years with 15.1 years of education; 88.7% were Caucasian and 45.5% were male. The sample was divided into two groups based on their AD8 scores: those with a negative dementia screening test (AD8 score 0 or 1, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ137) and those with a positive dementia screening test (AD8 score ‚â•2, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ120). Individuals with positive AD8 scores had abnormal Pittsburgh compound B binding (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) compared with individuals with negative AD8 scores. Individuals with positive AD8 tests and positive biomarkers scored in the impaired range on the Wechsler Logical Memory Story A (mean score 7.0‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4.5 for Pittsburgh compound B; mean score 7.6‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ5.3 for cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta protein 1-42). The AD8 area under the curve for Pittsburgh compound B was 0.737 (95% confidence interval: 0.64-0.83) and for cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta protein 1-42 was 0.685 (95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.77) suggesting good discrimination. The AD8 had superior sensitivity in detecting early stages of dementia compared with the Mini Mental State Examination. The AD8 had a likelihood ratio of a positive test of 5.8 (95% confidence interval: 5.4-6.3) and likelihood ratio of a negative test of 0.04 (95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.06), increasing the pre-test probability of an individual having symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with AD8 scores of ‚â•2 had a biomarker phenotype consistent with Alzheimer's disease and lower performance on episodic memory tests, supporting a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Informant-based assessments may be superior to performance-based screening measures such as the Mini Mental State Examination in corresponding to underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology, particularly at the earliest stages of decline. The use of a brief test such as the AD8 may improve strategies for detecting dementia in community settings where biomarkers may not be readily available, and may enrich clinical trial recruitment by increasing the likelihood that participants have underlying biomarker abnormalities."
CD010771,0,20799249,0,A Bayesian approach to simultaneously adjusting for verification and reference standard bias in diagnostic test studies.,"Verification bias arises in diagnostic test evaluation studies when the results from a first test are verified by a reference test only in a non-representative subsample of the original study subjects. This occurs, for example, when inclusion probabilities for the subsample depend on first-stage results and/or on a covariate related to disease status. Reference standard bias arises when the reference test itself has imperfect sensitivity and specificity, but this information is ignored in the analysis. Reference standard bias typically results in underestimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the test under evaluation, since subjects that are correctly diagnosed by the test can be considered as misdiagnosed owing to the imperfections in the reference standard. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian approach for simultaneously addressing both verification and reference standard bias. Our models consider two types of verification bias, first when subjects are selected for verification based on initial test results alone, and then when selection is based on initial test results and a covariate. We also present a model that adjusts for a third potential bias that arises when tests are analyzed assuming conditional independence between tests, but some dependence exists between the initial test and the reference test. We examine the properties of our models using simulated data, and then apply them to a study of a screening test for dementia, providing bias-adjusted estimates of the sensitivity and specificity."

The Hasegawa Dementia Scale-revised (HDS-R) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) are widely used in Japan to screen for dementia. Both place an emphasis on memory function, but neither examines visuo-spatial memory (VSM) function, even though VSM deficits are a sensitive marker for the detection of conversion to dementia. Furthermore, brief tests of VSM that are appropriate for screening have not been standardized. Thus, in the present study, we devised a brief, computer-aided short-term VSM test."

To evaluate behavioral symptoms after stroke and clinical characteristics that may influence the number and frequency of such symptoms, we compared 53 survivors of mild ischemic stroke with 30 stroke-free controls. Stroke survivor and control participants completed self-ratings of behavioral symptoms and were administered measures of cognitive status (ie, Beck Depression Inventory II, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test). Informants of stroke survivors and controls completed ratings of behavioral symptoms and functional status (ie, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, and Functional Activities Questionnaire). More behavioral symptoms were observed in stroke survivors than in controls (mean [standard deviation] total number of symptoms on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, 2.1 [2.0] vs 1.1 [1.5]; P = .02). Informants of stroke survivors were more likely to recognize behavioral symptoms than were stroke survivors themselves. Higher initial stroke severity was associated with more behavioral symptoms. With more behavioral symptoms, there was more functional impairment. Our findings suggest that behavioral symptoms can have unique and troublesome effects on stroke patients. Future research is needed to understand how the identification of behavioral symptoms after stroke can improve care in stroke survivors."

Correlation between the DAFS-BR total score and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) was moderate and significant (r = -.65, p < .001) in the total sample, whereas it did not reach statistical significance within each diagnostic group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses suggested that DAFS-BR has good sensitivity and specificity to identify MCI and AD. Results suggest that DAFS-BR can document degrees of severity of functional impairment among Brazilian older adults."

CD010771,0,20164591,0,"The computerized self test (CST): an interactive, internet accessible cognitive screening test for dementia.","The computer self test (CST) is an interactive, internet-based instrument designed to assess functional cognitive domains impaired by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study consisted of 215 total subjects with a mean age of 75.24. The 84 cognitively impaired patients (excluding patients diagnosed as MCI) met all criteria set forth by NINCDS/ADRDA for the diagnosis of AD. Control participants consisted of 104 age-matched individuals who were cognitively unimpaired. All patients completed the CST prior to other routine neurocognitive procedures. The CST accurately classified 96% of the cognitively impaired individuals as compared to controls, while the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) accurately classified 71% and the Mini-Cog 69% in the same respect. In addition, the CST accurately classified 91% of the six experimental groups (control, MCI, early AD, mild to moderate, moderate to severe, and severe) as compared to 54% for the MMSE and 48% for the Mini-Cog. In conclusions, the CST demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity and specificity and is capable of accurately identifying cognitive impairment in patients with variable degrees of cognitive abnormality. This interactive internet-based cognitive screening tool may aid in early detection of cognitive impairment in the primary care setting. The ease of use and interpretation may also provide the means to obtain an accurate baseline from which to monitor cognitive changes over time."

The purpose of the study was to establish the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of IQCODE (IQCODE-T) and the ability of the questionnaire to distinguish between older adults with DSM-IV-TR dementia (n = 100) and healthy control participants (n = 60). In addition, the power of the IQCODE-T to distinguish between patients with depression and dementia was investigated. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was performed on all participants and the IQCODE-T was administered to their informants. The IQCODE-T, which was not associated with age or education of the patients, significantly differentiated patients with dementia and controls. The IQCODE-T also correctly classified 73% of depressed patients as ""non-demented"". Because it is easy to administer, not associated with age/education and yields fewer false-positive results than the MMSE in depression, the IQCODE-T can be used in the detection of dementia."

CD010771,0,21140955,0,[Mokken scaling of the Cognitive Screening Test].,"The Cognitive Screening Test (CST) is a twenty-item orientation questionnaire in Dutch, that is commonly used to evaluate cognitive impairment. This study applied Mokken Scale Analysis, a non-parametric set of techniques derived from item response theory (IRT), to CST-data of 466 consecutive participants in psychogeriatric day care. The full item set and the standard short version of fourteen items both met the assumptions of the monotone homogeneity model, with scalability coefficient H = 0.39, which is considered weak. In order to select items that would fulfil the assumption of invariant item ordering or the double monotonicity model, the subjects were randomly partitioned into a training set (50% of the sample) and a test set (the remaining half). By means of an automated item selection eleven items were found to measure one latent trait, with H = 0.67 and item H coefficients larger than 0.51. Cross-validation of the item analysis in the remaining half of the subjects gave comparable values (H = 0.66; item H coefficients larger than 0.56). The selected items involve year, place of residence, birth date, the monarch's and prime minister's names, and their predecessors. Applying optimal discriminant analysis (ODA) it was found that the full set of twenty CST items performed best in distinguishing two predefined groups of patients of lower or higher cognitive ability, as established by an independent criterion derived from the Amsterdam Dementia Screening Test. The chance corrected predictive value or prognostic utility was 47.5% for the full item set, 45.2% for the fourteen items of the standard short version of the CST, and 46.1% for the homogeneous, unidimensional set of selected eleven items. The results of the item analysis support the application of the CST in cognitive assessment, and revealed a more reliable 'short' version of the CST than the standard short version (CST14)."

CD010771,0,19864908,0,Validation of Addenbrooke's cognitive examination (ACE) in a Persian-speaking population.,"Use of reliable screening and diagnostic tests for assessment of cognitive abilities in neurological patients is rapidly increasing in clinical practice. This is due to the increase in the prevalence of dementias and the raised awareness of cognitive impairment in neurological disorders. Two well-known bedside screening tests for dementias among the English-speaking population are the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE). However, such tests have not been developed for the Persian-speaking population, which is estimated at 120 million worldwide. In this study we developed the Persian ACE and MMSE, adopted from the English version. We also assessed the sensitivity and specificity of these tests in the identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We found that the Persian ACE at a cutoff point of 84, has a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 91% in discriminating MCI from a normal population; at 78, the test has a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 93% in differentiating MCI from AD, and at a similar cutoff point has a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96% in discriminating AD from a normal population.

We investigated the relationships between CASI domain scores and cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglc) as shown by positron emission tomography. Fifteen patients with very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 15 with mild AD were studied using the [(18)F]fluoro-deoxyglucose method. The 9 CASI domains were classified into four clusters (recent memory, frontal cortex cluster, posterior cortex cluster, and orientation). Using the region of interest method, the recent memory cluster was correlated with the bilateral hippocampal CMRglc, the frontal cortex cluster was correlated with the bilateral anterior and right inferior frontal CMRglc, the posterior cortex cluster was correlated with the bilateral temporo-parieto-occipital and occipital CMRglc, and the orientation cluster was correlated with the left anterior frontal CMRglc (Spearman's correlations). The use of statistical parametric mapping showed that most CASI domains were correlated with CMRglc of the left frontal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the angular gyrus. These findings show that the mental dysfunction assessed using CASI in AD patients has a neurobiological basis."

CAT accomplishes this by only using items that are appropriate for the level of ability of the patient under investigation. Potential advantages of CAT for clinical practice and research are efficient cognitive testing and a reduction of the test burden in elderly patients and consequently less measurement error during testing. In a two step method with previously collected CAMCOG data (n = 797) (1) patient abilities and CAMCOG item difficulties were estimated with the One Parameter Logistic Model (OPLM), a Rasch type of model. CAT was then used (2) to re-estimate the patient abilities. Despite an average test reduction of 60%, CAT estimates were in excellent agreement (intra-class correlation > 0.98) with the results based on the entire CAMCOG and they also had similar accuracy for the diagnosis of dementia (area under the curve 0.91) as the original CAMCOG. These results were replicated in an independent sample (n = 170). We conclude that tailored testing with CAT enables much more efficient screening for dementia than testing with an extensive instrument."

This awareness can be assessed by means of the discrepancy between the assessment of memory problems by patient and partner. In this study, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE-N) was used to assess the level of awareness. The results show that the discrepancy score (the difference between the IQCODE-Nscore of the patient and the IQCODE-Nscore of the partner) was significantly higher for the 61 MCI-patients when compared to the 40 healthy elderly (p = 0,01). This suggests a diminished awareness in MCI-patients. Analysis of the range of the MCI-group shows that this is true for 60% of the patients.

The objectives of this study were to (1) study and compare the predialysis and postdialysis mini mental status examination score and 2 subscores and compare them with those of a control group and (2) determine the factors affecting these scores. This was a prospective study of 54 HD patients, which involved calculation of their predialysis (PrHDSc) and (2-4 weeks later) postdialysis (PoHDSc) scores and comparison of these with the control scores (CoSc). The mean scores for PreHDSc and PoHDSc were 26.5+/-2.7 and 26.4+/-3.3, respectively. Both were significantly lower than CoSc, 28.4+/-1.6 (95% CI for score difference 0.99-2.97, P<0.001). The subscores for orientation, registration, and recall (ORR) and attention (ATT) before and after HD were 14.2+/-1.3, 14.3+/-1.8, and 3.5+/-1.7, 3.2+/-1.8, respectively. Both were significantly lower than the CoSc, 15.2+/-1.2 and 4.2+/-1.1 (P=0.001 and 0.004, respectively). There were no significant differences between the PrHDSc and PoHDSc (P values of 0.87, 0.63, and 0.45, respectively). Patients' PrHDSc correlated positively with PoHDSc and dialysis efficiency measured by the urea reduction ratio and Kt/V (r=0.58, 0.4, and 0.34, respectively). Education level correlated positively with PrHDSc r=0.41 but not PoHDSc. Hemodialysis duration correlated negatively with PrHDSc r=-0.3. There was no correlation among age, chronic renal failure duration, HD frequency, weight loss, systolic or diastolic blood pressure drop, and PrHDSc or PoHDSc. Hemodialysis patients scored significantly less than the control patients. Their score was not affected by HD.

The present work aimed to determine education-adjusted cut-off scores and correspondent sensitivity (S) and specificity (Sp) values of the category fluency (CF) test (animals/min) as a screening tool for Alzheimer disease (AD). Eighty-eight patients with mild AD and 117 normal matched controls were evaluated. Patients and controls were divided into 4 groups according to educational level (illiterates, 1 to 3, 4 to 7, and > or =8 y) and were administered the CF test. In each group, cut-off values were determined using Receiver Operator Characteristic analysis. The areas under Receiver Operator Characteristic curves were 0.922/0.914/0.963/0.954, for the identification of AD among the groups of illiterates, 1 to 3, 4 to 7, and > or =8 years of education, respectively. The cut-off points for each group were 9 (S=90.5% and Sp=80.6%) for illiterates; 12 (S=95.2%% and Sp=80.0%) for 1 to 3 years; 12 (S=91.3% and Sp=91.9%) for 4 to 7 years, and 13 for those with > or =8 years (S=82.6% and Sp=100.0%). These results suggest that the CF may be a useful screening test for mild AD in different educational levels, with the need of using specific cut-off scores adjusted for each range of schooling."

The present study aimed to modify and assess the reliability and validity of the modified IQCODE consisting of 32 items. The study consisted of two methods of assessing dementia: DSMIV diagnosis carried out by clinicians, and informants responding to the IQCODE. The subjects were 200 pairs of elderly subjects and their informants who visited the Geriatric Clinic, Ramathibodi Hospital. The optimal cutoff score on the modified IQCODE was 3.42, with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and accuracy were 0.94, 0.90, and 0.92, respectively. The IQCODE items had high internal consistency. The IQCODE associated with the elderly person's age, but not with their gender and educational level; nor were they associated with the demographic characteristics of the informant. Therefore, the IQCODE could be used as an alternative screening test for dementia in Thailand with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. This tool may be useful for dementia screening in the community and the geriatric clinic for early detection of disease."

A sample of 90 elderly subjects (31 with evidence of post-operative delirium), non-demented at baseline, was screened for cognitive decline and dementia. Diagnosis of dementia was highly associated with the occurrence of delirium. The relative risk for the diagnosis of dementia among subjects with previous history of delirium, according to the IQcode screening, was 10.5 (95% CI: 3.3-33.2). Such patients had a significantly higher mean IQcode score (3.75) as compared to controls (3.1; p < 0.001). Cognitive functions most affected in these patients were memory, orientation and abstract thinking. We conclude that the occurrence of post-operative delirium in cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects is associated with a worse cognitive outcome and an increased risk of dementia."

The study design was an age and gender matched case-control study. Seventy managed care members, 35 with dementia (cases) and 35 without dementia (controls), were assessed using BSCI embedded within a longer health assessment questionnaire commonly used in Medicare-managed care. A number of measures were used to examine validity of BSCI, including comparisons of the differences between cases and controls in BSCI scores, comparisons of the correlations between patient scores on BSCI and the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE, a common screening test for dementia) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS, a common dementia assessment test), and comparisons of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the three instruments. BSCI scores for cases and controls were significantly different, as were their scores for the MMSE and ADAS. Scores on BSCI were significantly correlated with scores for the MMSE and ADAS using both the Kendall's tau-b and Spearman rank-order correlation; correlations ranged from 0.654 between BSCI and ADAS to -0.83 for the correlation between BSCI and the MMSE (p < 0.001 for both). The areas under the ROC curves ranged from 0.94 to 0.96 for the three tests, meaning that they were equally accurate in discriminating between demented and nondemented patients. BSCI, a brief telephone screen for cognitive impairment due to dementia, discriminates between demented patients and normal controls as well as two standard tests of dementia, and may be considered a valid screen for dementia. Compared to existing screening tests, it has the additional advantages of extreme brevity, and ease of administration and scoring by lay interviewers via telephone. The use of brief screening instruments for dementia, such as the one validated here, will be increasingly important for the effective management of dementia and other chronic diseases where dementia is a coexisting condition."

The cognitive profile on ACE and DRS subtests distinguished subcortical diseases from each other as well as from AD. All parkinsonian syndromes were characterized by a disproportionate impairment in verbal fluency, particularly letter fluency. The three diseases differed, however, in the degree of language, memory and visuospatial impairment. We conclude that similarities, as well as differences, between PSP, MSA and CBD can be detected using a brief, clinically applicable cognitive screening test. The pattern of cognitive impairment is likely to reflect a different distribution of pathology, in particular a higher degree of cortical involvement in PSP and CBD."

CD010771,0,15164196,0,Frequency and determinants of prestroke dementia in a Chinese cohort.,"Pre-existing dementia among patients with acute stroke is common, and adversely affects outcomes. Only a few studies have been published on prestroke dementia (PSD), none of which have investigated a consecutive stroke cohort in an Asian patient population. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and clinical correlates of PSD in Chinese stroke patients in Hong Kong. Close and reliable informants of 289 stroke patients who were consecutively admitted to the medical wards of a university-affiliated regional hospital completed the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) within 1 week after their relative's admission. The presence of PSD was defined as an average IQCODE score of >or= 4.00. In addition, a wide range of demographic and clinical variables were examined and recorded.Twenty-two participants (7.6%) had PSD. The frequency of PSD in the group of subjects (n = 73) who were assessed within 48 hours after their admission was 12.3%. Univariate analysis found that PSD was associated with age, marital status, atrial fibrillation (AF), previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA), leukoaraiosis, and cerebral atrophy index (CAI). Multivariate logistic regression suggested that CAI, age, AF, and past TIA were independent risk factors for PSD. The low prevalence of PSD in Chinese patients in comparison with their Caucasian counterparts may be due to the difference in the time frame of the assessment. Comparative studies involving both Caucasian and Chinese stroke patients are required to further explore the role of AF and TIA in the development of PSD in both Chinese and Caucasian patients."

Cognitive variables included selected subtests from the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales (SENAS; Mungas et al., 2000): Verbal Memory, Object Naming, Verbal Attention Span, Verbal Conceptual Thinking, and Pattern Recognition. The association between the IQCODE and selected neuroimaging variables, hippocampal volume and white matter hyperintensity, was evaluated in a subsample of English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic individuals. The cognitive variables showed strong bivariate relationships with the IQCODE, although only Verbal Memory and Object Naming independently predicted level of functional ability. Verbal Memory was the strongest predictor of functional status, accounting for 23% of the variance in the IQCODE. White matter hyperintensity was also independently related to the IQCODE, accounting for 18% of the variance. Hippocampal volume was related to the IQCODE in a simple bivariate analysis, but was not an independent predictor of reported functional status after controlling for age. The relationships between cognitive variables and functional status, as well as between the imaging variables and the IQCODE, did not differ across language-ethnic groups."

The current practice of scoring a screening test involves simply summing the correct responses from each item. However, this method may be imprecise and inefficient in the predictive power of the score for dementia. We propose a latent variable model approach for the scoring and item selection of such tests. We model the item responses to be random variables based on latent variables. We also model the disease outcomes to be a function of the latent variables. Maximum likelihood estimates are obtained by maximizing the joint likelihood functions of disease and the item responses over a specified distribution function for the latent variables. Variances of model parameters are estimated using a nonparametric bootstrap method. We illustrate the approach using a screening test for dementia from a community-based study."

CD010771,0,12751884,0,The Delirium Observation Screening Scale: a screening instrument for delirium.,"The Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) scale, a 25-item scale, was developed to facilitate early recognition of delirium, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria, based on nurses' observations during regular care. The scale was tested for content validity by a group of seven experts in the field of delirium. Internal consistency, predictive validity, and concurrent and construct validity were tested in two prospective studies with high risk groups of patients: geriatric medicine patients and elderly hip fracture patients. Among the patients admitted to a geriatric department (N = 82), 4 became delirious; among the elderly hip fracture patients (N = 92), 18 became delirious. The DOS scale was determined to be content valid and showed high internal consistency, alpha = 0.93 and alpha = 0.96. Predictive validity against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV diagnosis of delirium made by a geriatrician was good in both studies. Correlations of the DOS scale with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were Rs -0.79 (p < or = 0.001) in the hip fracture patients and Rs -0.66 (p < or = 0.001) in the geriatric medicine patients. Concurrent validity, as tested by comparison of the research nurse's ratings of the DOS scale and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), for the group of hip fracture patients was 0.63 (p < or = 0.001). Construct validity of the DOS was tested against the Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline in Elderly (IQCODE), a preexisting psychiatric diagnosis and the Barthel Index. Correlation with the IQCODE was 0.74 (p < or = 0.001) in the study with the hip fracture patients and 0.33 (p < or = 0.05) in the study with the geriatric medicine patients. Correlation with the Barthel Index was -0.26 (p < or = 0.05) in the geriatric medicine patients and -0.55 (p < or = 0.001) in the hip fracture patients. The overall conclusion of these studies is that the DOS scale shows satisfactory validity and reliability, to guide early recognition of delirium by nurses' observation."

CD010771,0,12527986,0,Influence of prestroke dementia on early and delayed mortality in stroke patients.,"Causes of early and delayed death after stroke differ. It has been suggested that delayed mortality rate was increased in patients with post-stroke dementia. Prestroke dementia is frequent: its influence on survival in stroke patients has never been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of prestroke dementia on early and delayed mortality rate after stroke. In a cohort of 202 consecutive stroke patients aged >or= 40 years admitted between November 1995 and May 1996 in a primary care center, the prevalence of prestroke dementia was determined using the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) with a cut-off of 104. Patients were followed-up for 3 years. Statistics were performed using life-table methods. Of 202 patients, 33 had prestroke dementia. Of 142 survivors at month-6, 44 were demented, of them 15 having prestroke and 29 new-onset post-stroke dementia. No patient was lost to follow-up. The risk of death at month-6 was higher in patients with prestroke dementia (RR 2.7; 95 % CI: 1.6-4.8). However, independent predictors of early death were age, severity of the deficit at admission, type and etiology of stroke. The risk of delayed death was higher in patients with prestroke dementia (RR 4.97; 95 % CI: 1.76-13.98) as in patients with new-onset post-stroke dementia (RR 6.24; 95 % CI: 2.67-14.57), compared with non-demented patients. The mortality rate did not differ between patients with prestroke and new-onset post-stroke dementia. Dementia at month-6 was an independent predictor of delayed death (RR 5.7; 95 % CI: 2.4-13.4), with age and stroke recurrence. Causes of death did not differ between demented and non-demented patients. Dementia adversely influences vital outcome in stroke patients, perhaps partly because the therapeutic approach differs between demented and non-demented patients."

CD010771,0,12611290,0,[Does education influence the results of the Amsterdam Dementia-Screening Test (ADS)?].,"The goal of this study was to explore the correlation between education and the results of five dementia screening tests. In a study of 551 consecutively enrolled psychogeriatric day care attendants individual differences in education explained only very small portions of variance (< or = 0.63%) in four tests (visual recognition memory, orientation, category fluency and alternating sequences) of the Amsterdam Dementia Screening Test, a standard neuropsychological battery. The only exception was graphical copying of two- or three-dimensional geometric designs, where education explained 6.25% of the variance in copying accuracy. The more education participants had (from incomplete or complete primary education, through extended primary education, lower technical and vocational training, and secondary to higher education), the better their copying performance was. There was however one exception, in that participants with secondary education copied designs significantly less accurately than participants with lower technical and vocational training. Differences in copying accuracy of subjects with higher versus lower educational attainment were largest for participants matched for high levels of cognitive function. More severe cognitive impairment attenuated education effects. Higher education did not protect against decline of copying performance as a consequence of increasing cognitive impairment. For each of three educational levels, premorbid copying performance was estimated by constructing a regression equation using an independent measure of cognitive functioning (in terms of visual recognition memory, orientation and category fluency) as the predictor variable. The results support the clinical utility of controlling for educational level when interpreting individual copying performance."

CD010771,0,12492785,0,Defining dementia: clinical criteria for the diagnosis of vascular dementia.,"The recognition of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) as a contributing factor and a cause of dementia has led to the development of clinical criteria for vascular dementia (VaD). Due to high specificity, the consensus criteria developed by the National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (AIREN) have been used in controlled clinical trials to select patients with pure VaD. VaD is predominantly a subcortical frontal form of dementia with prominent executive dysfunction. In contrast, the criteria of the NINCDS-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA) emphasize memory loss as the main feature to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) from VaD and from other forms of dementia. Moreover, CVD may precipitate the clinical expression of AD. Although no criteria have been created specifically for patients having AD with CVD, the ischemic score, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly and a history of prestroke mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be useful for identifying patients with this mixed form of dementia."

Patients were also evaluated using the Mini-mental State Exam (MMSE), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Kohs Block Design, and word fluency. CD was scored using the Shulman method. CD scores showed a high interrater reliability (r = 0.97). CD by non-demented subjects was essentially normal. As a screening test for Alzheimer disease (AD, mean MMSE = 18.0), CD had a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 96.7%. However, four of eight AD patients who showed normal MMSE score (> or = 24) drew abnormal clocks. CD scores in dementia were significantly correlated with performance on the Block Design (r = 0.68), MMSE (r = 0.56), and the Mental Control subtest in the WMS (r = 0.58). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that performance on the MMSE and the Block Design explain 53.8% of the variance in the CD scores. These findings indicate that low CD score by the Shulman method may be reflective of a constructional disability and general severity of dementia. CD is not so sensitive as the result of the original report when the patient group includes milder cases of AD. CD is, however, an efficient screening test for detecting and following the patients with dementia, especially combined with the MMSE."

The seven subtests of the CERAD battery (Mini-Mental State Examination or MMSE, verbal fluency, Modified Boston Naming Test or MBNT, construction ability, learning of word lists, recall, and recognition), a short test of crystallized intelligence (vocabulary test or WST), and a simple test of visuo-motor tracking (number relation test-G or ZVT-G) were applied to 30 healthy control subjects, 49 depressed patients, and 98 mildly to severely demented patients. All subtests of the CERAD battery separated controls from mildly demented patients. Overall, depressed patients scored between controls and mildly demented patients. Score differences between depressed patients and mildly demented patients were significant for MMSE, learning and recall of the word list, verbal fluency, and MBNT.

This recommendation has not been widely implemented. None the less, there is growing evidence that ECF impairment is common, strongly associated with disability and functional decline, and not well detected by traditional dementia screening tests.

CD010771,0,10939786,0,Blood pressure reduction and risk of dementia in patients with stroke: rationale of the dementia assessment in PROGRESS (Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study). PROGRESS Management Committee.,"High blood pressure is a known risk factor for multi-infarct dementia, a subtype of dementia caused by the occurrence of several strokes. However, this form of dementia is relatively uncommon and the influence of blood pressure on the risk of other subtypes of vascular dementia remains to be clarified. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that vascular risk factors could also play a part in Alzheimer's disease. One of the aims of Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) is to test the hypothesis that blood pressure decreasing treatment based on perindopril would reduce the incidence of dementia among patients with cerebrovascular disease. The dementia procedures in PROGRESS involve a classical two-phase design, with an initial screening phase based mainly on the Mini-Mental State Examination - a simple, brief, and widely used screening test for dementia. The second phase involves a diagnostic assessment for dementia in individuals screened as positive according to the criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed.). In this project, two other domains of the relationship between vascular risk factors and cognition are being explored in relation to PROGRESS substudies. The apolipoprotein E polymorphism, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, is being determined in each patient, as part of the genetic substudy. This will allow study of the relationship between this polymorphism and blood pressure, and of the effect of blood pressure decreasing treatment on the risk of dementia. The magnetic resistance imaging substudy will improve understanding of the relationship between blood pressure decreasing and the occurrence of cerebral white matter lesions, which are known to be related to cognitive decline and dementia."
CD010771,0,10921301,0,[Simple screening test for dementia in elderly persons the time and charge test].,"Dementia, with its associated morbidity and mortality, has emerged as a leading public health problem with elderly persons and its early detection is of obrious importance for treatment in curable cases and referral of patients to optimal medical facilities with education support for family members. While the precision of detecting demented subjects by the existing screening methods has improved in recent years, they are still complex and time consuming in practice and therefore difficult to use. We have developed an screening method adapted for Japanese based on ""The Time and Charge Test"" of Froehlich and coworkers. The time test evaluates the understanding of clock hands indicating 11:10, and the charge test the ability selecting 100 yen from a group of coins consisting of one 50-yen coin, seven 10-yen coins and seven 5-yen coins. This test was conducted on 40 persons (two out of whom dropped out) living in Roken facility (a health facility for the elderly) and another 40 visiting a day care center for the elderly. The test results were studied using Mini-Mental State Examination and Hasegawa's Dementia Scale-revised version. The sensitivity of our test was 49.1%, the specificity 95.2%, the negative predictive value 40.8%, and the positive predictive value 96.6%. When a time limit 5 seconds for completing the task for the time test and 20 seconds for the charge test, the sensitivity was 87.7%, the specificity 57.1% the negative predictive value 63.2%, and the positive predictive value 84.7%. As for reproducibility, test-retest gave a value of 85.0%, and the inter-observer agreement was 89.5%. This simple method thus appears useful for screening for dementia."

CD010771,0,10818539,0,Relevance of white matter changes to pre- and poststroke dementia.,"White matter changes are often associated with stroke, risk factors for stroke, and dementia. From a theoretical point of view, they may be associated with an increased risk of pre- or poststroke dementia because (i) they are linked with subtle cognitive decline, which may add to the consequences of the stroke lesions and of associated Alzheimer pathology; and (ii) they indicate an increased risk of stroke recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of white matter changes to pre- and poststroke dementia. The relationship between preexisting dementia and white matter changes was evaluated in the Lille stroke-dementia cohort. We assessed the cognitive functioning prior to stroke in 202 consecutive patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, by means of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). We classified in the dementia group patients with IQCODE scores of 104 or more. White matter changes were rated on CT with the Blennow's rating scale. Thirty-three of 202 patients were demented before stroke (16.3%; 95% confidence interval: 11.2-21.4); the logistic regression analysis found that female sex, family dementia, white matter changes, and cerebral atrophy were independently associated with prestroke dementia. White matter changes were also associated with an increased risk of poststroke dementia, 2 years after stroke onset. Thus, white matter changes contribute to dementia occurring in stroke patients."
CD010771,0,10812327,1,Performance characteristics of a two-stage dementia screen in a population sample.,"We analyzed the performance of a two-stage screening protocol [the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MS) or the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline (IQCODE), and the Dementia Questionnaire (DQ)] in a weighted stratified sample of 839 subjects from a population survey of dementia in Cache County, UT. The subjects were subsequently examined using a standardized diagnostic assessment protocol. Using the method of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the main outcome measure was area under the ROC curve (AUC). The overall AUC estimates were 0.956 (95% confidence interval 0.943-0.968) for the 3MS/IQCODE and 0.945 (0.931-0.960) for the DQ. After adjustment for age, the efficiency of the both 3MS/IQCODE and the DQ was better for subjects with genotype epsilon4/epsilon4 at APOE, better among women, and better in those with two or more years duration of dementia. The optimal threshold for this two-stage screen yielded sensitivity and specificity estimates of 91.0% and 92.0%, respectively."
CD010771,0,10773648,0,Correlates of informant-rated cognitive decline after stroke.,"Cognitive impairment is common after stroke, but measurement is problematic. Six tests of mental ability, unaffected by loss of limb function, were administered to 49 subjects of mean age 74.2 years at a median of 4.3 years (range 0.1-16.8) after stroke together with a depression score and the IQCODE, an informant-rated scale of estimated cognitive decline. Over 90% of stroke patients were able to complete most tests. IQCODE correlated significantly with the HADS depression score (r = 0.35, p = 0.040), the 2-year Barthel score (r = -0.60, p = 0.001) and with a general cognitive factor extracted from the mental ability test scores (r = -0.42, p = 0.016).

From the Adult Health Study (AHS) population of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, 2052 men and women aged 60 or over and living in Hiroshima were evaluated for their cognitive functions using the CASI. Dementia was diagnosed in 93 and 1,959 were considered not to suffer from dementia based on the DSM-III-R criteria using neurological examination and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) completed by caregivers. Multivariate regression analysis not only indicated that total score was higher with lower age and higher education but that the slope of its decrease is steeper with higher age and fewer years of education. The slope of score decrease with increase of age was steeper for women than for men. Furthermore, CASI items were categorized by domains of cognitive function. Multivariate regression analysis for each cognitive domain showed clear effects of age and level of education. The effect of age for the nondementia subjects was large in cognitive domains dealing with temporal orientation, short-term memory, and list-generating fluency. The most useful cognitive domains for diagnosing dementia were temporal orientation, short-term memory, and list-generating fluency, as was indicated by high sensitivity and specificity."

Participants were dementia patients and psychiatric patients (n = 147). In both groups no floor-effect was found on the Digit Span test. Principal components analysis showed that CST and ADS6-scores had relatively high loadings on one factor, in contrast to digit span scores that loaded on a second factor. On average, psychiatric patients did hardly worse than normal controls. Attention deficits were more apparent in dementia patients. Considering a maximum of r = .41, these more or less subtle deficits were only moderately related to dementia screening test performance. It is concluded that the adapted Digit Span test is suitable for measuring attention deficits in elderly patients. However, Digit Span predicts performance on dementia screening test only to a modest degree."

A total of 100 patients with mild to moderate AD were recruited and randomly assigned to active or placebo treatment. The active group received 30 mg/day of tacrine for the first 6 weeks, 60 mg/day for the next 6 weeks, 90 mg/day for 6 more weeks and then 120 mg/day for the remaining 12 weeks. Safety evaluations included biweekly determinations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The primary outcome measures were Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) by investigator and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). Secondary outcome measures were Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Deficit Scale (ADS) and CGIC by caregivers. Sixty-eight patients were included in an intent-to-treat analysis (48 active and 20 placebo); 56 patients had evaluable data at week 30 (36 active and 20 placebo). The results of the complete case analysis revealed a significant improvement in the CASI and MMSE scores of the active group in the 18th week (90 mg/day) and the 30th week (120 mg/day) (p < 0.01). In the intent-to-treat analysis, significant improvement of the active group was noted on CASI at week 30 (p = 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the measures of IQCODE, CGIC and ADS. The primary reasons for withdrawal of tacrine-treated patients (39 patients, 52%) were asymptomatic ALT elevation, anorexia and nausea/vomiting. These patients all recovered from the adverse events on discontinuation of treatment.

The ADS has six subtests: picture recognition, orientation, drawing alternating sequences, category fluency, copying geometric figures, and free recall with immediate yes-no recognition of eight words. As was determined by logistic regression analysis, attentional control (EMCT), category fluency and picture recognition scores were significant predictors of verbal free recall. Recognition memory for pictures and a short orientation questionnaire (month, year, place) predicted word recognition performance. In 97% of the subjects with poor scores on EMCT and category fluency, an equally poor free recall performance was found. In those cases the incremental diagnostic value of the free recall test is doubtful.

They were also assessed for IQ, aberrant behavior, and current mental status; test-retest and interrater reliability were evaluated as well. Internal consistency, as assessed by coefficient alpha, was moderately high (alpha = .86). Test-retest reliability was mediocre and interrater reliability levels did not reach statistical significance. The Short IQCODE was not correlated with a variety of demographic features or with behavior ratings, showing evidence of divergent validity. However, the Short IQCODE was only weakly (nonsignificantly) correlated with a measure of current mental status, which challenges its concurrent validity. The Short IQCODE probably needs to be modified further for satisfactory psychometric performance in people with mental retardation. However, some features of this study may have resulted in suboptimal estimates of the Short IQCODE's psychometric characteristics."

Subjects scoring below the cut-off point of the MMSE and/or MODA were clinically evaluated. Clinical diagnoses were adopted as the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of the two tests were calculated. Our findings show that the correction for age and education of the raw score of the MMSE causes the loss of the mildest demented patients and heavily reduces the sensitivity of the screening test (from 85.7% to 71.4%), while it accounts for a moderate improvement in the specificity (from 90.0% to 96.3%).

All of them are affected by factors such as age, sex, educational level, sensory deficits and several mental disorders. The information provided by a proxy close to the patient has been used during recent years in dementia diagnosis. Therefore, new questionnaires, which use standardized information from relatives, have been developed. The aim of this study was to validate a Spanish version (S-IQCODE) of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), a dementia screening questionnaire in Spanish population-based samples. A validity study of the screening tool was carried out in two population-based samples of community-dwelling elderly with different sociodemographic characteristics (urban and rural samples). Dementia diagnosis was performed by neurologists according to DSM-III-R criteria. The S-IQCODE showed a higher accuracy than the MMSE in both samples: sensitivity of 82% and 83% vs 73% and 83%, specificity of 90% and 83% vs 78% and 74%, accuracy of 89% and 83% vs 77% and 75%. Moreover, while the S-IQCODE did not have associations with any extraneous factors, the MMSE showed significant correlations with age (-0.51), educational level (0.62), mental health (-0.40), premorbid intelligence (0.67) and intellectual level (0.75).

CD010771,0,9071438,0,"Application of a Spanish version of the ""Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly"" in the clinical assessment of dementia.","We studied the validity of a complete (S-IQCODE) and a shortened (SS- IQCODE) Spanish version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) for the diagnosis of dementia in a clinical setting. Fifty-three consecutive outpatients were assessed with an extensive workup and followed up for 6 months in a specialized clinic for the diagnosis and management of dementia. Thirty eight (71%) were finally diagnosed as demented. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) had a slightly greater diagnostic power than did the S-IQCODE and the SS-IQCODE (sensitivity 89% vs. 84% and 79%; specificity 80% vs. 73% for both; positive predictive value 92% vs. 89% and 88%; negative predictive value 75% vs. 65% and 58%), but without statistical significance. Both the S-IQCODE and SS-IQCODE were independent of previous education of the patients. The best diagnostic results were obtained when the cognitive scores of the patient in the MMSE and the report of the relative in the S-IQCODE were simultaneously considered. We conclude that the IQCODE, in a complete as well as in a shortened form, is a good diagnostic instrument in the clinical setting that can enhance the validity of other cognitive tests."
CD010771,0,9063339,0,A 5-year longitudinal study of the Mini-Mental State Examination in normal aging.,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) measures global cognitive performance and is often used as a screening test for dementia. This paper presents a 5-year longitudinal study of the MMSE score in a sample of 2,537 non-demented French community residents aged 65 years and older who were participants in the Paquid Study in 1988-1992. Subjects were evaluated at the baseline visit (T0) and 1 year (T1), 3 years (T3), and 5 years (T5) later. Analyses performed with a random effects linear model showed that the score rose between T0 and T1 (by 0.60 points for subjects aged 65 years at T0 to 0.83 points for subjects aged 85 years at T0), then it decreased very slightly between T1 and T5 (by 0.02 points for subjects aged 65 years to 0.57 points for subjects aged 85 years). The improvement during the first year, which was larger for less educated subjects, may be explained by the stress due to the test situation at T0 or by a learning effect at T1. The decline during the last 4 years was more pronounced for older and less well educated subjects. The cross-sectional measure of age effect was larger than the longitudinal measure of time effect. This difference may be explained by a cohort effect or by a practice effect induced by repetition of the test. The authors conclude that the MMSE score declines very slightly in non-demented subjects, thus suggesting that the cognitive processes involved are spared by the aging process. These results may have implications for dementia screening."
CD010771,0,9050430,0,The psychogeriatric assessment scales (PAS): further data on psychometric properties and validity from a longitudinal study of the elderly.,"The PAS is a standardized interview which assesses the changes seen in dementia and depression using a set of scales. There are three scales derived from an interview with the subject (cognitive impairment, depression, stroke) and three from an interview with an informant (cognitive decline, behaviour change, stroke). The aim was to provide data on the psychometric properties and validity of the PAS. The scales were originally developed using data from the first wave of a longitudinal study of the elderly. Reported here are further data on the PAS from the second wave of the same study, carried out 3 1/2 years later. The setting was a community survey carried out in the Australian city of Canberra. Seven hundred and nine elderly persons, with a mean age of 80 years, and 641 informants participated. Besides the PAS, participants were administered several other scales: the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, the National Adult Reading Test and the Goldberg anxiety and depression scales. Diagnoses of dementia and depression were made with the Canberra Interview for the Elderly, from which the PAS is derived. Confirmatory factor analysis replicated the five-factor model which underpins the PAS. The PAS was found to correlate with the other scales having similar content and showed correspondence with diagnoses of dementia and depression derived from the Canberra Interview for the Elderly. Longitudinal data supported the validity of the cognitive decline scale as a measure of change. Overall, the results support the original psychometric and validity research on the PAS."

The analysis suggested that there were significant correlations between amyloid precursor protein and cognitive decline as assessed by the IQCODE. Preliminary investigations of Down syndrome suggest amyloid precursor protein levels are associated with duration of dementia in the group. The findings imply circulating amyloid precursor protein has a more central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."
CD010771,0,9180766,0,Informant questionnaires as screening measures to detect dementia.

The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of an informant questionnaire in detecting cognitive decline in the elderly.
CD010771,0,8970013,0,The cognitive assessment screening test (CAST) for dementia.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness, the sensitivity, and the specificity of the Cognitive Assessment. Screening Test (CAST), a paper-and-pencil self-administered cognitive test designed to screen elderly people for possible dementia, for use in general physicians' offices, requiring little expertise or staff time. CAST consists of three parts: part A (relatively easy), part B (more demanding), and part C (self-report of concerns). CAST was administered in two studies to: (1) 19 patients known to be mildly to moderately demented versus 24 age-matched normal controls (to establish cutoff standards); and (2) a ""real world"" sample of 26 elderly patients not known to be demented, attending a general medicine clinic. The sensitivity and specificity of CAST were compared with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Blessed Dementia Scale cognitive portion (BDS-cog). In study 1, controls were given a detailed neuropsychological battery; in study 2, all patients were given the neuropsychological battery, which served as the ""gold standard"" to identify individuals with cognitive impairment. In study 1, the cutoff scores for dementia using CAST (Parts A and B) were established. CAST discriminated demented patients from controls with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 88%; the MMSE had a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 100%; and the BDS-cog had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96%. In study 2, CAST discriminated cognitive impairment with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 38% and a specificity of 100%; and the BDS-cog had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 94%. Part C was not used to discriminate demented from normal elderly individuals, but to screen for those concerned about their cognitive functioning. CAST is highly useful as a dementia screening test, with sensitivity and specificity equal to or better than the MMSE and BDS-cog, yet requiring minimal examiner time and little training or experience to administer."
CD010771,0,8908414,0,Sociodemographic predictors and concurrent validity of the Mini Mental State Examination and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale.,"The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) are among the most commonly used screening tests for dementia. The goals of our study were, firstly, to identify sociodemographic factors which may explain the variance of test results in a community sample and, secondly, to investigate the interrelationship of these two dementia screening tests in order to evaluate the concurrent validity. A total of 1947 subjects were investigated in the setting of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study (ASPS). Our study confirms most previous results demonstrating a relationship of higher dementia test scores with both younger age and higher educational level. Interestingly, the results we obtained suggest only a weak relationship and poor concurrent validity of the two tests. The total scores of the two tests show poor joint variance. This could lead to the conclusion that these tests evaluate different cognitive domains."
CD010771,0,8701446,0,[Screening tests for dementia: agreement between CST14 and ADS3 is incomplete (Cognitive Screening Test and Amsterdam Dementia Test)].,"The agreement between two screening tests for the detection of dementia was tested by comparing a 14-item orientation questionnaire (Cognitive Screening Test or CST14) and the short version of the Amsterdam Dementia Screening Test (ADS3: Visual Memory, Orientation and Fluency. All 106 consecutive patients (71% female) of a psychogeriatric day care center were tested in two sessions. Their mean age was 77,7 (range 52-89). Taking the advised cutting-scores into account, we found consistent results for 74% of the patients (95%-confidence interval: 65%-82%): 60 patients were positive for dementia on both tests, and 18 were negative. For 28 patients the results were inconsistent, in that more patients scored in the impaired range for ADS3 than for CST14."
CD010771,0,8677826,1,Informant ratings of cognitive decline of elderly people: relationship to longitudinal change on cognitive tests.,"Formal assessment of cognitive decline with cognitive tests can be difficult, requiring either two measurement points or a comparison of 'hold' with 'don't hold' tests. Informant-based assessment provides an alternative approach because informants can adopt a longitudinal perspective and directly rate cognitive change. A study was carried out to assess the validity of informant ratings collected by means of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). A community sample of 500 subjects aged 74 or over underwent four cognitive tests on two occasions 3 1/2 years apart. On the second occasion, informants filled out the IQCODE. Subjects rated as having moderate or severe decline were found to have greater change on the cognitive tests. These findings support the validity of informant ratings of cognitive decline."

CD010771,0,8618670,0,Age and education correction of Mini-Mental State Examination for English and Spanish-speaking elderly.,"Previous research has shown that the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMS) is biased as a measure of cognitive impairment in minority and low-education patients. The purpose of this study was to (1) develop a statistical correction for effects of age and education and (2) test the efficacy of the statistically adjusted MMS (MMSAdj) as a screening test for dementia using different ethnic groups and education levels. We used a population-base community survey sample (n=590) composed of 46.6% Hispanics and 53.4% non-Hispanics to derive the statistical correction, defined as:MMSAdj = Raw MMS - (0.471 X [Education-12]) + (0.131 X [Age-70]). Ethnicity and language of test administration were not significantly related to MMSAdj in the community survey sample, but the raw MMS was strongly influenced by these factors. We used an independent sample (n=2,983) of patients evaluated through the California Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers to test the diagnostic accuracy of the MMS and the MMSAdj across low- and high-education groups and across whites, Hispanics, and blacks. Results showed greater stability of sensitivity and specificity across education levels and ethnic groups for the MMSAdj than for the raw MMS and suggest that the MMSAdj is a preferable measure of cognitive impairment for low- education and minority individuals."

The reliability and validity of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), an instrument that screens for dementia in general, have been established. We conducted a study to validate a French version of the IQCODE as a screening test for Alzheimer's dementia in the elderly living in the community."
CD010771,0,8665726,0,[Word fluency in spinocerebellar degeneration].,"Two types of verbal fluency task-initial letter fluency and category (semantic) fluency--were examined in eleven patients with spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), twenty four patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and twenty control subjects without neurological signs and symptoms. All patients and subjects showed normal results from the screening test for dementia. The numbers of initial letter fluency were less than those of category fluency in all groups. For category fluency, patients with SCD or PD had significantly lower scores than controls. For initial letter fluency, patients with SCD produced significantly lower scores than controls, but patients with PD did not produce significantly lower scores than controls. It is considered that the poor performance on both initial letter and category fluency in patients with SCD or Pd was related to disturbance of semantic memory associated with subcortical impairment, and the poor performance on initial letter fluency in patients with SCD was caused by the initiation and retrieval problems based on disturbance of frontostriatal circuits and linguistic systems. Therefore, we suggested cerebellar hemisphere played a role on the order and timing of rule-based generation of letters."
CD010771,0,8623028,0,Performance on a smell screening test (the MODSIT): a study of 510 predominantly illiterate Chinese subjects.,"The 12-item Modular Smell Identification Test (MODSIT) was administered to 239 male and 271 female Chinese subjects whose age ranged from 50 to 92 years (68.3 +/- 10.9) and whose education ranged from 0 to 20 years (2.5 +/- 4.3). Every participant was examined by a physician and was found to be free of dementia, stroke, and Parkinson's disease. Different from the standard procedures, only one-third of each odor pad was used for each subject, the four odor choices were presented orally for the majority of subjects, and they were not forced to make a selection when they could not detect or identify the odor. The average level of performance was 46% correct. The score was negatively associated with age, positively associated with education and with performance on a dementia screening test, and corroborated with subjects' report of smell deterioration in recent years. Nonsmokers and women performed better than smokers and men. The 12-item MODSIT had an internal consistency reliability of 0.73 and a 7-month retest stability of 0.57 with different examiners. The MODSIT is satisfactory for group studies, even when administered with suboptimal procedures such as those used in the present study."
CD010771,0,8563660,0,CAMCOG--a concise neuropsychological test to assist dementia diagnosis: socio-demographic determinants in an elderly population sample.,"The CAMCOG, which forms part of the CAMDEX interview (Roth et al., 1986, 1988), is a brief neuropsychological battery designed to assess the range of cognitive functions required for a diagnosis of dementia, and to detect mild degrees of cognitive impairment. It was administered to a population sample of 418 elderly people (aged 77 and above) in their place of residence. The data show that in contrast to the Mini-Mental State Examination, total CAMCOG scores are well distributed and there is no ceiling effect. Examination of the association between CAMCOG scores and socio-demographic variables (age, sex, education and social class) shows that each exerts a significant, and independent, effect upon performance. CAMCOG also includes a number of subscale which assess individual areas of cognitive function. Of the eight major subscales (orientation, language, memory, attention, praxis, calculation, abstract thinking, perception), age was significantly related to all but attention; sex with attention, praxis, calculation and perception; education with language and abstract thinking; and social class with language and perception. In all these analyses, the results were adjusted for the effects of the other socio-demographic variables using analysis of variance. However, education and social class are highly correlated variables and when the association with education is examined without adjusting for social class, attention and praxis are also found to be significantly related to education. Caution must therefore be taken when using the CAMCOG (or any other cognitive test) as a screening test for dementia, using a single, predetermined cutpoint. In general, the combination of brevity and breadth of the CAMCOG, along with its distributional properties, makes it an attractive neuropsychological test for use in the community or the clinic."
CD010771,0,7824143,1,The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) as a screening tool for dementia for a predominantly illiterate Chinese population.,"The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) provides ratings of an individual's changes in everyday cognitive functions during the previous 10 years. Original studies conducted in Australia showed that its score was not influenced by the subjects' educational backgrounds and that it performed at least as well as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a screening instrument for dementia. The subjects of the present study were Chinese and included 399 community residents and 61 dementia patients. Their ages ranged from 50 to 92 years; their education levels ranged from 0 to 19 years, and 63% of them had never attended school. We administered the IQCODE to informants and the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), from which a CASI-estimated score of the MMSE (MMSE-CE) can be obtained, to the subjects. The diagnosis of dementia was made independently by physicians according to the DSM-III-R criteria based on semistructured interview and testing, neurologic examination, and standardized assessments of cerebral vascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. The Chinese IQCODE showed no association with the subjects' education level or gender, low association with their age, and moderately high association with their MMSE-CE score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the IQCODE was significantly larger than that of the MMSE-CE for the whole group and for the subgroup with 1 to 19 years of education but not for the subgroup with 0 years of education. Nine of the 26 items of the IQCODE could be deleted without appreciable reduction in sensitivity and specificity. The IQCODE (1) can be shortened to 17 items, (2) had good cross-cultural applicability, and (3) was better than the MMSE-CE as a screening tool for dementia in a population with large variation in educational backgrounds."
CD010771,0,7662322,1,"The screening of mild dementia with a shortened Spanish version of the ""Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly"".","Most of the present screening tests for the detection of dementia fail with mild dementia. Jorm et al. recently presented the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), a simple instrument with good diagnostic validity that uses a close relative to obtain information on the cognitive decline of a patient. We used a Spanish adaptation of this questionnaire (S-IQCODE) validated in a population-based sample, and a shortened form (SS-IQCODE) obtained after analyzing the items and reducing them to only 17. The S-IQCODE and the SS-IQCODE have greater diagnostic validity for mild dementia than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (sensitivity: 86% for both versus 57%; specificity: 92 and 91% versus 84%, positive predictive value: 54 and 50% versus 29%; negative predictive value: 91 and 90% versus 81%) and, unlike the MMSE, are independent of the age, education, and previous intelligence of the subjects. According to the results of this study, the SS-IQCODE could be a useful screening test for the detection of mild dementia in the Spanish-speaking aged population, with greater diagnostic power and less contamination by independent variables than the MMSE."
CD010771,0,7629532,0,Relation between education and dementia: the role of test bias revisited.,"Several authors have suggested that dementia screening tests may be biased against low levels of education, whereas others find that a low level of education is a genuine risk factor for dementia. The present paper attempts to reconcile these conflicting views by examining item bias and test bias indices of the mini mental state examination (MMSE). Psychometric calculations and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses of sensitivity and specificity as performed by earlier studies were replicated and extended from the database of the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly. This is a population survey on cognitive decline and dementia (age range 65-84). Subjects with a low level of education (primary school) were compared with better educated subjects (at least some secondary education). Cases were matched by age and sex. The results indicate that the MMSE is not educationally biased as far as item characteristics, reliability, and construct validity are concerned. Yet its predictive validity as a screening test for dementia is educationally biased. This bias will effectively be eliminated with a two point higher cut off score for the subjects whose education extends beyond primary school. Even after such score correction, a low level of education probably remains a genuine risk factor for dementia."

All the inhabitants over 74 years of age in one area of Stockholm took the MMSE. The test was then compared to the clinical diagnosis of dementia. With a cut-off point of 23/24, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 92%, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 69%. Age, sex, and education did not substantially affect the specificity and the PPV, but had a slight effect on the sensitivity. The main causes of the false positives were somatic and psychiatric disorders. These results are in agreement with studies performed with similar methods and comparable populations."

The MMSE has been consistently found to correlate with education and, at the same time, education is regarded by some researchers as being of potential etiological significance for dementia. In the present study, results on the MMSE from a community-based study in Sweden were compared with two standards: the clinical diagnosis of dementia and the Katz index of daily living activities. For both these comparisons, education did not substantially change the predictive ability of the MMSE. Our data, when compared with previous studies, show that the influence of education on the predictive ability of the MMSE varies in different populations. We conclude that differential MMSE cut-off points for different educational levels or adjustment techniques for education are not universally applicable."

We evaluated its usefulness compared with the standard Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in elderly acute medical and surgical hospital admissions.

Using the MMSE as the standard, clock drawing had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 87%. Patients with discrepant scores were then further evaluated. The findings suggest that normal clock drawing ability reasonably excludes cognitive impairment or other causes of an abnormal MMSE in elderly acute medical and surgical hospital admissions, where cognitive impairment is common and frequently missed."

In a survey dealing with cerebral aging, the MMSE administered 2,792 subjects aged 65 years and over, who continued to live at home. The total score decreased with age and increased markedly when the educational level rose. The proportion of failures was higher than or equal to 10% for 12 of the 30 MMSE items, including the 5 items designed to measure attention ability (serial subtractions) and the 3 ones exploring delayed memory. Regarding these 12 items, the percentage of failures increased homogeneously with age, but the relationship with educational level was heterogeneous: it was very strong for the calculation items, weaker for the delayed memory items. These results pointed to the complex relationships between MMSE scores and educational level, and suggested a possible bias related to the screening tool in dementia surveys."

Results suggest that despite differences in the content of the three instruments, they are equally discriminant. Methods involving direct cognitive examination were found to lose discriminability in relation to milder forms of dementia, whereas an informant questionnaire was found to perform equally as well on cases of mild and moderate dementia.

Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of the MMSE were examined among three strata of educational attainment: middle school, high school, and college/graduate school. MMSE ROC curve areas were .95-.96 in the three educational strata. Assuming a dementia prevalence of 10%-30%, the most accurate lower limits of normal for MMSE scores and their attendant sensitivities and specificities were 21 for middle school (.82/.94), 23 for high school (.79/.97), and 24 for college/graduate school (.83/1.00) attainment. These norms accurately classified over 90% of subjects in all three educational strata. We conclude that education-specific norms optimize performance of the MMSE as a screening test for Alzheimer's dementia in elderly outpatients."
CD010771,0,1776585,0,The prevalence of dementia in a total population: a comparison of two screening instruments.,"Two short screening tests for dementia, the Information/Orientation (IO) sub-test of the Clifton Assessment Scale (CAPE) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were included in a survey of 1579 elderly people of a large general practice. All those scoring 21 and under on the MMSE, a one in two sample of those scoring 22, 23 and a one in ten sample of the remainder were investigated further using the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the elderly (CAMDEX). The prevalences of moderate to severe dementia and mild to severe dementia determined from the CAMDEX interview were 4.8% and 14.2%, respectively. For detection of moderate to severe dementia, a cut-point of 21/22 on the MMSE gave a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 85% and an overall prevalence of 19.7%; mild to severe dementia was best detected by a cut-point of 23/24 giving a sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 81% and prevalence of 28.5%. A cut-point of 7/8 on the IO sub-test gave a sensitivity and specificity for detecting moderate to severe dementia of 87% and 97%, respectively, with a prevalence of 7.3%; for mild to severe dementia a cut-point of 10/11 gave a sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 94% and prevalence of 14.7%."
CD010771,0,2284389,0,The relationship between intellectual impairment and mood disorder in the first year after stroke.,"In a community-based study of patients with a first-ever stroke, intellectual impairment (as defined by scores on a common screening test for dementia, the Mini-Mental State Examination) was found in 26% at 1 month post-stroke, and in 21% at 6 and 12 month follow-up. Low scores on the screening test were associated with greater age, physical disability before the stroke, larger stroke lesion volumes as measured on CT scan, and non-stroke changes such as atrophy and white matter low attenuation on the CT scan. There was a negative correlation between scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination and symptom levels on two measures of mood disorder. However, there was no evidence of a specific relationship between major depression and low scores on the Mini-Mental State. We examined various aspects of the relationship between mood symptoms and low scores on the Mini-Mental State, but found no evidence to support the suggestion that this relationship represented an example of depressive pseudodementia. We discuss the significance of our findings for clinical psychiatry and neuropsychology."

CD010771,0,2807680,0,Cross-validation of a dementia screening test in a heterogeneous population.,Recognition of the increasing importance of early dementia screening for both research and clinical purposes has led to the development of numerous screening instruments. The most promising of these are based on neuropsychological measures which are able to focus on very specific cognitive functions. Of these tests the Iowa screening test is of particular interest to researchers and clinicians working with heterogenous populations or wishing to make cross-cultural comparisons as it is relatively culture-fair and does not assume literacy. A preliminary study of the performance of the Iowa in an Israeli sample of diverse ethnic origins and low education level suggests it to be a very sensitive measure even in such groups. The study also demonstrates the inadvisability of adopting item weights derived by multivariate statistical techniques from another population.
CD010771,0,2651606,0,Validity and reliability of auditory screening tests in demented and non-demented older adults.,"The validity and reliability of auditory screening tests were evaluated in 34 demented and 31 non-demented elderly outpatients. In reference to an audiometric gold standard (40-dB HL hearing loss in speech frequencies), 512-Hz and 1024-Hz tuning forks, finger rub, and whispered voice tests performed well (ROC curve areas = 0.82 to 0.94). Simultaneously high (greater than 0.80) sensitivities and specificities were achievable for all these tests in demented patients. In non-demented patients, however, only the whispered voice test achieved simultaneously high specificity and sensitivity. The most accurate rule for air conduction screening audiometry was the inability to hear greater than or equal to two of four 40-dB HL speech frequencies (sensitivity = 1.0, specificity = 0.75 in non-demented patients; sensitivity = 0.97, specificity = 0.74 in demented patients). Interobserver/test-retest reliability was generally high for tuning forks, finger rub, and whispered voice tests (range of intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.38 to 0.90), and was somewhat higher in demented than in non-demented patients. These results suggest that some of the simple, traditional methods of auditory screening may have considerable validity and reliability in demented and non-demented older adults."
CD010771,0,2642498,0,Instruments for screening for depression and dementia in a long-term care facility.,"The high prevalence of mental disorders such as depression and dementia in institutionalized elderly patients warrants screening for psychiatric diagnosis in patients newly admitted to long-term care facilities. The diagnostic accuracy of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was evaluated against a standardized psychiatric interview. The MMSE was found to be 81% sensitive and 83% specific in screening for dementia using a previously established cutpoint of less than 24/30 points. Adjusting MMSE scores for physical disabilities precluding completion of specific tasks on the MMSE did not significantly change the diagnostic accuracy of the test. The GDS was 47% sensitive and 75% specific in screening for depression using the suggested cutpoint of greater than 13/30 points. The MMSE was significantly correlated with functional status (r = 0.48, P = .0001), but not with the scores on the GDS or the clinical diagnosis of depression. The GDS did not correlate with functional status. In summary, the MMSE is a good screening test for dementia in institutionalized elderly, but the GDS is not sensitive for depression in this population."
CD010771,0,2594878,1,"The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE): socio-demographic correlates, reliability, validity and some norms.","The IQCODE is a questionnaire which asks an informant about changes in an elderly person's everyday cognitive function. The questionnaire aims to assess cognitive decline independent of pre-morbid ability. In the present study, the IQCODE was administered to a sample of 613 informants from the general population. In addition, the questionnaire was administered to informants of 309 dementing subjects who had filled it out one year previously. A principal components analysis, using the general population sample, confirmed that the IQCODE measures a general factor of cognitive decline. The questionnaire was found to have high internal reliability in the general population sample (alpha = 0.95) and reasonably high test-retest reliability over one year in the dementing sample (r = 0.75). The total IQCODE score, as well as each of the 26-items, was found to discriminate well between the general population and dementing samples. The correlation with education was quite small (r = -0.13), indicating that contamination by premorbid ability is not a problem."
CD010771,0,2560521,0,In vivo effects by estrone sulfate on the central nervous system-senile dementia (Alzheimer's type).,"Seven women with senile dementia-Alzheimer's type (SDAT) were treated with conjugated estrogen [main content: estrone sulfate (E1-S)], at a dose of 1.25 mg/day over a 6-week period. A New Screening Test for Dementia developed by Japanese National Institute of Mental Health (NS) and the scores of Hasegawa Scale for dementia (HS) were performed every 3 weeks. Six women showed improvements in NS (P less than 0.05) and 5 women showed improvements in HS. Untreated women with SDAT did not show any improvement. Serum E1-S was measured by a direct radioimmunoassay. Serum E1-S was 911 +/- 156 pg/ml in 7 women with SDAT and lower than that of 7 normal women (1020 +/- 216 pg/ml). Following the treatment, serum E1-S increased to a level of 21.1 +/- 8.1 ng/ml. Estrone and estradiol-17 beta also increased. The results suggest a possibility for the future clinical use of estrogen for senile dementia, after careful clinical research trials including the side effects."
CD010771,0,3368071,0,Screening for dementia by memory testing.,"Enhanced cued recall provides a simple and clinically useful memory test for identifying dementia in the elderly. Because this test induces semantic processing and coordinates encoding and retrieval for maximum recall, genuine memory deficits due to impairment of specific memory processes can be distinguished from apparent memory deficits due to use of inefficient strategies or impairment of other cognitive processes. Since genuine memory deficits in the elderly are usually associated with dementia, their identification is highly predictive of clinical dementia. The present study validates the use of enhanced cued recall as a screening test for dementia in 70 aged subjects. All but one person with a pure amnesia were correctly classified. Enhanced cued recall correctly classified 97% of the 120 subjects in this and the previous study. Enhanced cued recall shows learning not revealed by free recall, providing more accurate measurement of memory, and distinguishes demented from nondemented elderly more accurately than either free recall or recognition."
CD010771,0,3294349,0,The screening of cognitive impairment in the elderly: a critical review of current methods.,"The continued appearance of new screening tests for dementia suggests both the continuing need for a valid measure of pathological cognitive change and dissatisfaction with what is currently available. A brief review of current tests is presented which focuses on the major theoretical and methodological issues which have impeded the development of adequate screening instruments. Strategies for the management of such difficulties are also indicated, with a view to guiding prospective researchers in this field and increasing the critical perspective of those currently using these instruments."
CD010771,0,3241463,0,A new screening test for dementia.,"The purpose of this study is to develop a new screening test for detecting the demented elderly in the early stage in communities. The test is easy to apply for consultation, guidance and care and is capable of administering differential diagnoses. Based on the 9 dementia rating scales used in Japan, Europe and the U.S., a new test was completed after investigating and modifying the design 5 times. The test consists of 20 items. This test was given to 203 subjects (59 males and 144 females) including normal elderly as well as those suspected of suffering from dementia. The internal consistency, reliability and validity were studied using clinical diagnoses (diagnostic criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III) and Karasawa's Criteria for Judging Senility), Hasegawa's Dementia Rating Scale and Mental Status Questionnaire (MSQ) as external criteria. The present test was confirmed to have sufficient effectiveness as the screening test for dementia."
CD010771,0,3660917,0,[Interdisciplinary research strategies in geriatric psychiatry--studies and results in dementia and depressed patients].,"Eighty-one patients (mean age: 66 +/- 9 years) who had been in gerontopsychiatric in-patient care were included in the study. As well as physical, psychiatric and neurological examinations, EEG, brain CT scanning and the determination of the Ischemic Scale were performed, in order to confirm the clinical diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), dementia of vascular type (DVT) or multi-infarct dementia (MID), and depression in old age, as based on the DSM III criteria. A comprehensive psychological test battery was administered, to one section of the subjects. Our results indicate that EEG and Ischemic Score can differentiate patients with DAT and DVT to a satisfactory degree, whereas CT findings and psychometric assessment were apt to confirm the overall diagnosis of dementia (DAT/DVT) and depression. Patients with dementia showed memory impairment to a greater extent than depressive patients, as could be proved by a memory test (Syndrom-Kurztest). However, a dementia screening test (Information-Memory-Concentration Test) could more accurately differentiate dementia and depression. The application of a comprehensive psychometric testing procedure did not prove to be an effective diagnostic tool in the assessment of various stages of dementia. Short dementia tests and rating scales seem to be appropriate to distinguish depression from dementia, especially in cases of mild to moderate dementia. In patients with very mild and insignificant organic brain disturbances these screening methods fall short of diagnostic validity. Beyond this, there is a current need for assessment instruments in the evaluation of alterations in personality and affectivity, such as are seen in depression."
CD010771,0,3619711,0,Comparison of two screening tests in Alzheimer's disease. The correlation and reliability of the Mini-Mental State Examination and the modified Blessed test.,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test (BOMC), a six-item derivative of the Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration Test, were each administered to 36 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In 24 patients, both tests were readministered a month later. The correlation between the MMSE and BOMC was -0.83 with a test-retest correlation of 0.89 (MMSE) and 0.77 (BOMC). Factor analysis indicated that the multiple MMSE cognitive components could be explained by two factors, which together accounted for 66% of the variance. These factors are conceptually similar to the components of the BOMC, and so may explain the substantial correlation between the two tests. Since these cognitive status tests seem to be equivalent for Alzheimer patients, the briefer measure (BOMC), which offers additional advantages, may be preferred."
CD010771,0,3611032,0,The Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) examination.,"The Mini-Mental State (MMS) examination is a widely used screening test for dementia. The Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) incorporates four added test items, more graded scoring, and some other minor changes. These modifications are designed to sample a broader variety of cognitive functions, cover a wider range of difficulty levels, and enhance the reliability and the validity of the scores. The 3MS retains the brevity, ease of administration, and objective scoring of the MMS but broadens the range of scores from 0-30 to 0-100. Greater sensitivities of the 3MS over the MMS are demonstrated with the pentagon item drawn by 249 patients. A summary form for administration and scoring that can generate both the MMS and the 3MS scores is provided so that the examiner can maintain continuity with existing data and can obtain a more informative assessment."
CD010771,0,3571790,0,Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire as a screening test for dementia and delirium among the elderly.,"Pfeiffer's Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) is a brief screening test for organic brain syndromes. The validity of the SPMSQ was evaluated in a random sample of 119 community residents and 282 consecutively admitted medical inpatients. The SPMSQ proved to be a sensitive and specific screening test for moderate to severe dementia both in the community and hospital. Using the cut-off point (number of errors accepted) of three errors, the sensitivity of the test was 86.2% and the specificity 99.0% among medical inpatients. The percentages in the community sample were 66.7% and 100%, respectively. The validity of the SPMSQ was not as good for delirium because of its variable clinical picture. For screening purposes lower cut-off points than previously recommended should be used: three errors for dementia and two errors for delirium. Among Finnish elderly people it was not necessary to use correction for education in the SPMSQ."

CD010771,0,7100362,0,Limits of the 'Mini-Mental State' as a screening test for dementia and delirium among hospital patients.,"With a psychiatrist's standardized clinical diagnosis as the criterion, the 'Mini-Mental State' Examination (MMSE) was 87% sensitive and 82% specific in detecting dementia and delirium among hospital patients on a general medical ward. The false positive ratio was 39% and the false negative ratio was 5%. All false positives had less than 9 years of education; many were 60 years of age or older. Performance on specific MMSE items was related to education or age. These findings confirm the MMSE's value as a screen instrument for dementia and delirium when later, more intensive diagnostic enquiry is possible; they reinforce earlier suggestions that the MMSE alone cannot yield a diagnosis for these conditions."
