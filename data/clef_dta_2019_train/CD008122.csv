CD008122,0,3898482,0,Imported malaria in Kuwait.,"The number of imported malaria cases in Kuwait rose from 87 in 1980 to 504 in 1983, an increase of 579%. The continued resurgence of malaria in endemic zones, improved diagnostic techniques and a heightened awareness of imported malaria have contributed to the increase in the number of microscopically proved cases. Thick blood films fixed in acetone and stained in Giemsa proved a rapid method of diagnosis; species identification on the basis of a thin film on the same slide was performed with ease. Malaria was acquired in 38 countries. Most patients were young male adults. Most of the cases were due to Plasmodium vivax originating from India, although an increasing number of P. falciparum cases are also now being diagnosed from there. P. falciparum infections were evenly distributed throughout the year and most cases presented within 14 days of their arrival in the country. The highest number of P. vivax cases were diagnosed between May and October, when heat stress might have been a factor in precipitating a clinical attack of an infection previously acquired in the endemic zone. Attention is drawn to the importance of delayed attacks of P. vivax and, in semi-immunes, of P. falciparum. The time interval involved in establishing a history of ""recent"" travel in clinically suspected cases of malaria needs to be more clearly defined in each geographical area. Cases of induced malaria due to transfusion, accidental and congenital infections were identified. The fatality rate due to P. falciparum infections was low. In terms of the risk of renewed transmission, Kuwait may be considered a vulnerable area."

It has been suggested that the occurrence of coinfections may be important, and may influence the natural history of both diseases. This study evaluated 545 patients with acute malaria, in Coari, Western Brazilian Amazon. 333 (61.1%) presented Plasmodium vivax malaria, 193 (35.4%) Plasmodium falciparum and 19 (3.5%) mixed infections. The HBsAg prevalence was 4.2% and total anti-HBc 49.7%. Patients with HBV serological markers presented no clinical differences than those with malaria only, nor showed any association with classic signs of hepatic disorder. Although showing no statistical significance, HBsAg reactive subjects presented lower parasitic load and higher antibody titers, suggesting the possibility that the immune response in a coinfected individual is differentiated and leads to a variation in the parasite load and antibody production."
CD008122,0,17547098,0,"Malaria specific mortality in lowlands and highlands of Muheza district, north-eastern Tanzania.","Vital registration of causes of death in Tanzania is incomplete and many deaths occur outside health care settings. Verbal autopsies (VA) are used to determine the underlying cause of death, and the probable diagnosis helps to estimate reasonably cause-specific mortality. In this paper, we report findings of a verbal autopsy survey which involved eight villages in both low and highlands of Muheza district, north-eastern Tanzania. The survey was conducted following a rapid census, which was done to identify households that had lost one or more members within a period of two years from the date of census. Trained research assistants administered VA questionnaires to parents/close relatives. Two physicians reviewed each report independently and a third opinion was sought where there was discordant report between the two. A total of 9,872 households were surveyed and 134 deaths were recorded. A total of 96 (71.6%) deaths were from lowland villages representing high malaria transmission. Majority (72.4%) of the reported deaths occurred at home whilst 32.1% occurred at heath facility settings. Overall, severe malaria was the leading cause accounting for 34.3% of all deaths. Infants were most affected and accounted for 43.5% of the total deaths. Pulmonary tuberculosis ranked second (8.2%) cause of deaths and was exclusively confined to individuals > or = 15 years. Probable cause of death could not be determined in 13.4% of deaths. In conclusion, majority of deaths in rural north-eastern Tanzania occur at home and the immediate causes are usually unknown or not documented. These findings indicate that the verbal autopsy is a useful tool for detecting leading causes of death at community level in the absence of health facility-based data."
CD008122,0,8560527,0,The effect of plasma free fatty acids and long-chain triglycerides on glucose metabolism in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.,"To investigate the therapeutic potential of increased plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride concentrations in hypoglycaemic patients receiving quinine, 32 untreated Thai adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were allocated at random to one of 4 regimens: 2 mg/kg/min dextrose infused over 60 min either alone (group A) or with a prior injection of 5000 units of heparin and simultaneous Intralipid infusion (group C), or 4 min/kg/min dextrose alone (group B) or with heparin and Intralipid (group D). Quinine (10 mg/kg) was also infused over 60 min in all cases. In patients of groups A and C, mean changes in plasma glucose concentrations from the beginning to the end of the infusion were 0.1 (SD 0.8) and 1.0 (SD 0.7) mmol/L respectively (P = 0.015). In groups B and D, plasma glucose increased by 1.8 (SD 1.2) and 2.2 (SD 0.4) mmol/L respectively (P < 0.5). Plasma FFA levels fell by approximately 50% during the infusion in groups A and B but increased by a similar percentage in groups C and D. Despite significant mean increases in plasma insulin during the infusion (from 12.2 milliunits (mu)/L in group A to 38.8 mu/L in group D), no rebound hypoglycaemia was observed in any patient during the ensuing 7 h. These data suggest that the glycaemic response to dextrose given at high rates, which match average glucose utilization in a severely ill patient with malaria, is not augmented by increased plasma FFA and long-chain triglycerides. However, this strategy increases the glycaemic efficacy of lower dextrose infusion rates and the combination could, therefore, reduce the volumes of hypertonic dextrose required to prevent hypoglycaemia in severely ill patients in whom optimal fluid balance is crucial."

CD008122,0,16843832,0,Microwave-assisted tissue processing for same-day EM-diagnosis of potential bioterrorism and clinical samples.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the turnaround times, section and image quality of a number of more ""difficult"" specimens destined for rapid diagnostic electron microscopy (EM) after microwave-assisted processing. The results were assessed and compared with those of conventionally processed samples. A variety of infectious agents, some with a potential for bioterrorism, and liver biopsies serving as an example for routine histopathology samples were studied. The samples represented virus-producing cell cultures (such as SARS-coronavirus, West Nile virus, Orthopox virus), bacteria suspensions (cultures of Escherichia coli and genetically knockout apathogenic Bacillus anthracis), suspensions of parasites (malaria Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania major, Microsporidia cuniculi, Caenorhabditis elegans), and whole Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with microsporidia. Fresh liver samples and infected flies were fixed in Karnovsky-fixative by microwaving (20 min), all other samples were fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde or Karnovsky-fixative overnight or longer. Subsequently, all samples were divided to evaluate alternative processing protocols: one part of the sample was OsO4-postfixed, ethanol-dehydrated, Epon-infiltrated (overnight) in an automated tissue processor (LYNX, Leica), and polymerized at 60 degrees C for 48 h; in parallel the other part was microwave-assisted processed in the bench microwave device (REM, Milestone), including post-osmication and the resin block polymerization. The microwave-assisted processing protocol required at minimum 3 h 20 min: the respective epon resin blocks were uniformly polymerized allowing an easy sectioning of semi- and ultrathin sections. Sections collected on non-coated 200 mesh grids were stable in the electron beam and showed an excellent preservation of the ultrastructure and high contrast, thus allowing an easy, unequivocal and rapid assessment of specimens. Compared with conventional routine methods, microwave technology facilitates a significant reduction in sample processing time from days to hours without any loss in ultrastructural details. Microwave-assisted processing could, therefore, be a substantial benefit for the routine electron microscopic diagnostic workload. Due to its speed and robust performance it could be applied wherever a rapid electron microscopy diagnosis is required, e.g., if bioterrorism or emerging agents are suspected. Combining microwave technology with digital image acquisition, the 1-day diagnosis based on ultrathin section electron microscopy will become possible, with crucial or interesting findings being consulted or shared worldwide with experts using modern telemicroscopy tools via Internet."
CD008122,0,10774675,0,Evaluation of direct agglutination test (DAT) as an immunodiagnostic tool for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in Nepal.,"Before field application of the direct agglutination test (DAT) for leishmaniasis, it was assessed as a diagnostic tool. Fifteen confirmed visceral leishmaniasis cases (bone marrow aspiration positive), 120 tuberculosis, 58 leprosy, 15 malaria, 26 intestinal parasitic infection cases, 24 endemic healthy controls from adjacent to the study area, and 18 controls from Kathmandu (who had never visited the VL endemic areas) were tested for anti-leishmanial antibody agglutination titers. Two of the tuberculosis cases were positive for anti-leishmanial agglutinating antibodies at 1:800. All the visceral leishmaniasis confirmed cases were reactive to anti-leishmanial antibody at > or = 1:3,200. Other specimens were negative for serology. The sensitivity of the direct agglutination test was 100% and the specificity was 99.2%. The direct agglutination test had positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 99.2% respectively. The direct agglutination test has been found to be simple, rapid, reliable, economic, safe and adaptable to micro-techniques using microtiter plates. It is specific and sensitive. The direct agglutination test is simple enough for it to be performed in a field laboratory."

CD008122,0,9347649,0,Levels of serum tumor necrosis factor alpha in relation to clinical involvement and treatment among Thai adults with Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum were measured in 17 Thai men infected with Plasmodium falciparum malarial infections to determine whether they were affected by severity of infections or exchange transfusions. Twelve patients were considered having complicated malarial infections, eight of whom had cerebral malaria. Five patients had uncomplicated malarial infections. The results showed that malarial infection markedly raised TNF-alpha level above normal values (mean +/- SEM 406 +/- 38 vs 15 +/- 5, p = 0.004). In complicated malaria, cerebral involvement appeared to significantly increase concentration of TNF-alpha when compared to values in uncomplicated malaria (mean +/- SEM 496 +/- 64 vs 339 +/- 12, p = 0.01). Degree of parasitemia, intravenous quinine (day 0 value vs day 7 value) and exchange transfusion did not significantly affect TNF-alpha levels."

The aim was to evaluate the performance and usefulness of the test as a diagnostic method in a malaria-endemic area, when performed by a field worker. Compared with microscopy, the test had a sensitivity of 96.5%, a specificity of 90.5%, a negative predictive value of 94.2% and a positive predictive value of 94.3%. Because of its sensitivity, specificity and simplicity, the ParaSight-F test will be of value in situations where microscopy is not possible."
CD008122,0,12125520,0,"Serological appraisal of malaria status in tribal area of Orissa, India.","A cross-sectional seroepidemiological study conducted in 173 tribal residents (including all age groups) from three villages of Sundergarh district of Orissa using ELISA as a tool revealed high levels of antibody titres against both AR1 and Pf antigens. The mean +/- S.D. ELISA O.D. obtained for AR1 were 0.73 +/- 0.2, 1.037 +/- 0.196, 1.05 +/- 0.42 and for Pf, 0.70 +/- 0.2, 1.0 +/- 0.28, 0.94 +/- 0.4 respectively for Badramoli, Jharbeda and Boneikela population. Parasitological results showed high incidence of malaria in < 5 years age group in Badramoli and Boneikela villages when compared to other age groups. An. fluviatilis was found to be the principle malaria vector as found in the HBI results. High ELISA O.D. and high equivalent transmission index (ETI) indicate a high malaria transmission in the area. Seroepidemiological studies could be used for effective surveillance and stratification of endemicity in a given area which can help in executing intervention strategy for malaria control."

CD008122,0,17659072,0,Polymorphism and epitope sharing between the alleles of merozoite surface protein-1 of Plasmodium falciparum among Indian isolates.,"The C-terminal region of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) is one of the leading candidates for vaccination against the erythrocytic stages of malaria. However, a major concern in the development of MSP-1 based malaria vaccine is the polymorphism observed in different geographical Plasmodium falciparum isolates. To explore whether the sequence heterogeneity of PfMSP-1 leads to variation in naturally acquired anti-MSP-119 antibodies, the present study was undertaken to study PfMSP-119 sequence polymorphism in malaria-endemic villages in eastern India and also carried out a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using three PfMSP-119 variant forms."
CD008122,0,9801342,0,Improved immunodiagnosis of human candidiasis by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a Candida albicans 52-kilodalton metallopeptidase.,"An immunogenic aminopeptidase of Candida albicans was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. It was then used for the development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies directed against this antigen in sera from patients with candidiasis. This enzyme specifically cleaves the L-Arg-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin substrate at pH 7.4 and was detected in the crude extract of different C. albicans isolates. Sera used for this study were obtained from healthy blood donors or from patients with one of the following: systemic candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, or malaria. The statistical analysis demonstrates significant differences between absorbency values obtained with sera from patients with candidiasis and with sera from the other groups (P = 0.000001). Diagnostic parameters show high diagnostic specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 83% at a cutoff value of 0.425 and suggest the usefulness of this aminopeptidase for the diagnosis of systemic candidiasis."
CD008122,0,9806864,0,Plasmodium vivax: a monoclonal antibody recognizes a circumsporozoite protein precursor on the sporozoite surface.,"The major surface circumsporozoite (CS) proteins are known to play a role in malaria sporozoite development and invasion of invertebrate and vertebrate host cells. Plasmodium vivax CS protein processing during mosquito midgut oocyst and salivary gland sporozoite development was studied using monoclonal antibodies which recognize different CS protein epitopes. Monoclonal antibodies which react with the CS amino acid repeat sequences by ELISA recognized a 50-kDa precursor protein in immature oocyst and additional 47- and 42-kDa proteins in older oocysts. A 42-kDa CS protein was detected after initial sporozoite invasion of mosquito salivary glands and an additional 50-kDa precursor CS protein observed later in infected salivary glands. These data confirm previous results with other Plasmodium species, in which more CS protein precursors were detected in oocysts than in salivary gland sporozoites. A monoclonal antibody (PvPCS) was characterized which reacts with an epitope found only in the 50-kDa precursor CS protein. PvPCS reacted with all P. vivax sporozoite strains tested by indirect immunofluorescent assay, homogeneously staining the sporozoite periphery with much lower intensity than that produced by anti-CS repeat antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy using PvPCS showed that the CS protein precursor was associated with peripheral cytoplasmic vacuoles and membranes of sporoblast and budding sporozoites in development oocysts. In salivary gland sporozoites, the CS protein precursor was primarily associated with micronemes and sporozoite membranes. Our results suggest that the 50-kDa CS protein precursor is synthesized intracellularly and secreted on the membrane surface, where it is proteolytically processed to form the 42-kDa mature CS protein. These data indicate that differences in CS protein processing in oocyst and salivary gland sporozoites development may occur."
CD008122,0,2692869,0,ELISA method for detecting Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite antibody.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for circulating IgG mouse antibody to Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein was modified for use with human sera collected in an area of northern Zambia that was endemic for malaria and from individuals never exposed to malaria. Optimum sensitivity was achieved using Immulon 2 microtitration plates, boiled casein-Tween 20 blocking buffer, and by adding a solution of boiled casein (4 micrograms/ml) to the capture antigen diluent. The results for the detection of anti-CS IgG correlated well with those of sporozoite immunofluorescence antibody assays. Modification of the ELISA method permitted the simultaneous detection of anti-CS IgG and IgM antibody on a single serum sample in the same well of the microtitration plate and the detection of anti-CS IgG antibody in Kenyan dried whole-blood samples collected on filter-paper. The assay has been used to monitor human antibody levels in a phase-I malaria vaccine trial and in longitudinal studies of malaria transmission in Thailand and Kenya."
CD008122,0,10466971,0,Malaria vectors in a traditional dry zone village in Sri Lanka.,"Malaria transmission by anopheline mosquitoes was studied in a traditional tank-irrigation-based rice-producing village in the malaria-endemic low country dry zone of northcentral Sri Lanka during the period August 1994-February 1997. Adult mosquitoes were collected from human and bovid bait catches, bovid-baited trap huts, indoor catches, and pit traps. Mosquito head-thoraces were tested for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, and blood-engorged abdomens for the presence of human blood by ELISAs. House surveys were done at two-day intervals to record cases of blood film-confirmed malaria among the villagers. A total of 7,823 female anophelines representing 14 species were collected. Trends in anopheline abundance were significantly correlated with rainfall of the preceding month in An. annularis, An. barbirostris, An. subpictus, An. vagus, and An. varuna, but were not significant in An. culicifacies and An. peditaeniatus. Malaria parasite infections were seen in seven mosquito species, with 75% of the positive mosquitoes containing P. falciparum and 25% P. vivax. Polymorph PV247 was recorded from a vector (i.e., An. varuna) for the first time in Sri Lanka. Computations of mean number of infective vector (MIV) rates using abundance, circumsporozoite (CS) protein rate, and human blood index (HBI) showed the highest rate in An. culicifacies. A malaria outbreak occurred from October 1994 to January 1995 in which 45.5% of village residents experienced at least a single disease episode. Thereafter, malaria incidence remained low. Anopheles culicifacies abundance lagged by one month correlated positively with monthly malaria incidence during the outbreak period, and although this species ranked fifth in terms of abundance, infection was associated with a high MIV rate due to a high CS protein rate and HBI. Abundance trends in other species did not correlate significantly with malaria. It was concluded that An. culicifacies was epidemiologically the most important vector in the study area."

CD008122,0,16438671,0,Antigen presentation and dendritic cell biology in malaria.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are important both in amplifying the innate immune response and in initiating adaptive immunity and shaping the type of T helper (Th) response. Although the role of DCs in immune responses to many intracellular pathogens has been delineated and research is underway to identify the mechanisms involved, relatively little is known concerning the role of DCs in immunity to malaria. In this review, we provide an overview and summary of previous and current studies aimed to investigate the role of DCs as antigen presenting cells (APCs). In addition, the role of DCs in inducing innate and adaptive immunity to blood-stage malaria is discussed and, where information is available, the mechanisms involved are presented. Data from studies in humans infected with Plasmodium falciparum, the major human parasite responsible for the high morbidity and mortality associated with malaria throughout many regions of the developing world, as well as data from experimental mouse models are presented. Overall, the data from these studies are conflicting. The possible reasons for these differences, including the use of different parasite species and parasite strains in the mouse studies, are discussed. Nevertheless, together the data have important implications for development of an effective malaria vaccine since the selection of appropriate Plasmodium antigens and/or adjuvants, targeting innate immune responses involving DCs, may provide optimal protection against malaria. It is hoped that this review promotes more investigation among malariologists and immunologists alike on DCs and malaria."

CD008122,0,9223163,0,Association between anti-Pfs48/45 reactivity and P. falciparum transmission-blocking activity in sera from Cameroon.,"Pfs48/45, a sexual stage parasite protein doublet of P. falciparum, is a target of antibodies which inhibit the development of the parasite in the mosquito. Twenty-eight (54%) out of 52 sera of gametocyte carriers from Cameroon reduced infectivity in the mosquito membrane feeding bioassay to less than 20% of the controls. These 52 sera were analysed by competition ELISAs for the presence of antibodies capable of competing the binding of six monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed against five different epitopes on Pfs48/45. The percentage of these 52 Cameroon sera that competed with one of the MoAbs ranged from 13% (epitope I) to 33% (epitope IIc). Comparison of activity in the transmission-blocking assay (> or = 80%) and in the Pfs48/45 competition ELISA show a relative specificity of 100% (24 of 24) and a relative sensitivity of 75% (21 of 28). Non-blocking sera showed no competition with any of the MoAbs. These MoAbs were further used to study the diversity of epitopes among isolates of P. falciparum using a two-site ELISA. MoAbs against epitope I, III and V reacted with four different isolates whereas epitope II could be subdivided into three epitopes. None of the isolates reacted with MoAb 3G12 (epitope IV). Using these four different isolates, the competition ELISA titre varies from 1/20 to 1/80 and no significant differences are found between the isolates except for epitope II where only three out of 11 positives for epitope IIa were also positive for epitope IIc."
CD008122,0,16438675,0,Regulating immunity to malaria.,"The optimal outcome of a malaria infection is that parasitized cells are killed and degraded without inducing significant pathology. Since much of the pathology of malaria infection can be immune-mediated, this implies that immune responses have to be carefully regulated. The mechanisms by which anti-malarial immune responses are believed to be regulated were discussed at the recent Malaria Immunology Workshop (Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; February 2005). Potential regulatory mechanisms include regulatory T cells, which have been shown to significantly modify cellular immune responses to various protozoan infections, including leishmania and malaria; neutralising antibodies to pro-inflammatory malarial toxins such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol and haemozoin; and self-regulating networks of effector molecules. Innate and adaptive immune responses are further moderated by the broader immunological environment, which is influenced by both the genetic background of the host and by co-infection with other pathogens. A detailed understanding of the interplay between these different immunoregulatory processes may facilitate the rationale design of vaccines and novel therapeutics."

CD008122,0,8710411,0,Hypoxanthine: a low molecular weight factor essential for growth of erythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum in a serum-free medium.,"A low molecular weight factor in a basal medium essential for erythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum development in a serum-free medium using a cell growth-promoting factor derived from adult bovine serum was detected. The factor was hypoxanthine. The optimal hypoxanthine concentration for parasite growth was between 15 and 120 microM. The contribution of hypoxanthine to increased parasite growth was clearly evident in cultures on day 4. Among various low molecular weight supplements tested, adenine, adenosine, AMP, ATP, cyclic AMP, guanine, guanosine, inosine, inosine monophosphate, xanthine, NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH and deoxyguanosine triphosphate showed a similar effect to that of hypoxanthine in the serum-free culture system. On the other hand, the addition of uric acid, FAD, thymidine, uridine, orotic acid, deoxythymidine triphosphate, deoxycytidine triphosphate, deoxyadenosine triphosphate, ribose-1-phosphate, or ethanolamine was not beneficial to the parasite growth. The results presented here will not only be of practical value, but will provide important information about the developmental requirements of the parasite."
CD008122,0,14668349,0,The Plasmodium falciparum PfGatp is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein important for the initial step of malarial glycerolipid synthesis.,"During its 48-h asexual life cycle within human erythrocytes, Plasmodium falciparum grows to many times its own size and divides to produce 16-32 new parasites. This rapid multiplication requires active synthesis of new membranes and is fueled by phospholipid precursors and fatty acids that are scavenged from the human host. Plasmodium membrane biogenesis relies heavily on the expression of parasite enzymes that incorporate these precursors into phospholipids. However, little is known about the genes involved in membrane biogenesis or where this process takes place within the parasite. Here, we describe the analysis in P. falciparum of the first step of phospholipid biosynthesis that controls acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate (GPAT) at the sn-1 position. We show that this activity is of parasite origin and is specific for glycerol 3-phosphate substrate. We have identified the gene, PfGAT, encoding this activity in P. falciparum and reconstituted its codon composition for optimal expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PfGAT complements the lethality of a yeast double mutant gat1Deltagat2Delta, lacking GPAT activity. Biochemical analysis revealed that PfGatp is a low affinity GPAT enzyme with a high specificity for C16:0 and C16:1 substrates. PfGatp is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic life cycle of the parasite but induced mainly at the trophozoite stage. This study, which describes the first protozoan GPAT gene, reveals an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum in the initial step of Plasmodium membrane biogenesis."

The 241 subjects were international travellers or immigrants from areas where malaria is endemic. When compared with the microscopical examination of bloodsmears (used as the 'gold standard'), the dipsticks were found to be 94.4% sensitive and 94.5% specific for pure infections with P. falciparum. The performance of the tests when used on patients infected with species other than P. falciparum or more than one Plasmodium spp. showed a high degree of variability. Although the dipsticks represent a very simple, rapid, and valuable diagnostic aid, they should not be considered a complete substitute for direct microscopical diagnosis using stained bloodsmears."
CD008122,0,11023075,0,Ex post and ex ante willingness to pay (WTP) for the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test kit in Myanmar.,"Willingness to pay (WTP) for the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test kit was assessed by the contingent valuation method using a bidding game approach in two villages in Myanmar. Kankone (KK) village has a rural health center (RHC) and Yae-Aye-Sann (YAS) is serviced by community health worker (CHW). The objectives were to assess WTP for the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test kit and to determine factors affecting the WTP. In both villages WTP was assessed in two different conditions, ex post and ex ante. The ex post WTP was assessed at an RHC in the KK village and at the residence of a CHW in the YAS village on patients immediately following diagnosis of malaria. The ex ante WTP was assessed by household interviews in both villages on people with a prior history of malaria. Ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression analysis was used to analyze factors affecting WTP. The WTP was higher in ex post conditions than ex ante in both villages. WTP was significantly positively associated with the average monthly income of the respondents and severity of illness in both ex post and ex ante conditions (p < 0.001). Distance between the residence of the respondents and the health center was significantly positively associated (p < 0.05) in the ex ante condition in a household survey of YAS village. Traveling time to RHC had a negative relationship with WTP (p < 0.05) in the ex post condition in the RHC survey in KK village."

To evaluate the antibody response during relapse, 5 relapsed patients were tested using the IgM capture ELISA. The IgM antibodies were negative in 99.7% of control group 1 and in 100% of control group 2; they were positive in 90.6% of the patient group. The total antibody levels were positive in 88.4% of the patient group with the direct sandwich ELISA. The sera from the second malaria episode, i.e., relapsed patients, were 100% positive on the IgM capture ELISA. The results of this study suggest that the IgM capture ELISA may be a useful diagnostic method for P. vivax malaria for both primary infection and relapse."

CD008122,0,1449196,0,Seroepidemiologic studies of humoral immune response to the Plasmodium falciparum antigens in Thailand.,"We have investigated seroreactivity against Plasmodium falciparum crude parasite antigens, the P. falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (Pf155/RESA), as well as against two synthetic peptides (EENV)6 and (EENVEHDA)3 that represent important epitopes of Pf155/RESA. The study population consisted of 421 children and adult Thais living in an area with moderate malaria transmission. We related these serologic findings to some important epidemiologic baseline data collected in the study area. The parasite rate in study subjects was 18.76%. Sixty-two percent were seropositive to crude P. falciparum antigens, 30.3% to the Pf155/RESA antigen, 23.05% to (EENV)6, and 20.17% to (EENVEHDA)3. Antibody responses to crude P. falciparum antigens and to Pf155/RESA were age dependent and increased with exposure. There was evidence that Pf155/RESA antibodies might play a role in protective immunity in this population. Since Pf155/RESA is a potential vaccine candidate antigen, the information obtained from these field studies will provide some seroepidemiologic baseline data for subsequent vaccine trials."

The Pan Malaria IgG CELISA (Cellabs) test, which uses recombinant antigens and detects exposure to all four forms of malaria (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae) was used as individuals. Using the consensus microscopy results as the standard, sensitivity of ELISA for detection of any malarial infection in the rural populations was 83%, specificity was 85%. These results show that the performance of ELISA for the detection of any malarial infection is adequate for acute- and post-emergency situations and rural populations when the alternative is just clinical diagnosis."
CD008122,0,18038150,1,Diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa: the challenges and public health implications.,"Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnancy is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and represents enormous diagnostic challenge. The objective of this report was to review scientific data from studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa on the diagnosis of malaria in pregnancy within the last two decades (1987 to 2007), to highlight the challenges and the public health implications. Using the Medline Entrez-Pubmed search, relevant publications were identified for the review via combinations of key words such as Malaria, Pregnancy, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which yielded 777 entries as of September 2007. The results from the various studies were discordant, due to differences in the techniques of sample collection and analysis, based on the differences in the definition of clinical, peripheral, and placental malaria. Definitions were based on the presence of malaria parasite and/or pigments in blood smear from peripheral/placental blood, on histological placental findings, on the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nonspecific clinical presentation of malaria, lack of efficient diagnostic facilities and trained personnel, and absence of regulatory standards for diagnostic tests, are some of the major diagnostic challenges. Increased allocation of resources to development and application of accurate diagnostics will improve malaria diagnosis in pregnancy."
CD008122,0,17481680,0,Complement activation in experimental human malaria infection.,"The objective of this study was to investigate complement activation in uncomplicated, early phases of human malaria. Fifteen healthy volunteers were experimentally infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Parasitemia and complement activation products were assessed. During blood stage parasitemia, volunteers showed a significant increase in soluble terminal complement complex (TCC) formation. After start of a curative regimen of artemether/lumefantrine, TCC further increased due to activation of both the classical and the alternative pathway. In-vitro studies confirmed activation of complement by parasite cultures. We thus detected an increase in complement activation in volunteers with experimentally induced malaria, even before parasitemia could be detected microscopically. This significant increase in complement activation occurred despite the possible control of TCC formation by complement regulatory proteins on erythrocytes and the extremely low levels of parasitemia. Treatment with artemether/lumefantrine was followed by classical and alternative pathway complement activation, without evidence for mannan-binding-lectin-mediated complement activation."
CD008122,0,18571758,0,Delivery of siRNA mediated by histidine-containing reducible polycations.,"Histidine containing reducible polycations based on CH(6)K(3)H(6)C monomers (His6 RPCs), are highly effective DNA transfection agents combining pH buffering endosomal escape mechanisms with rapid unpackaging following reduction in the cytoplasm. We examined their ability to mediate siRNA uptake into cells focusing on hepatocyte delivery. Co-delivery of EGFP siRNA with pEGFP plasmid DNA reduced reporter gene expression by 85%. However while DNA transfection efficiency increased with polymer size, with 162 k His6 RPCs proving the most effective, delivery of siRNA alone to EGFP stably expressing cells was only possible using 36-80 k polymers. Analysis of particle sizes showed that 80 k polymers formed more compact siRNA complexes than 162 k polymers. The reducible nature of the polymer was necessary for siRNA activity, since siRNA combined with non-reducible polylysine showed little activity. Incorporation of a targeting peptide from the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein onto His6 RPCs, significantly improved transfection of plasmid DNA and siRNA activity in hepatocytes, but not in most non-liver cells tested. siRNA targeted to the hepatitis B virus surface antigen delivered by CS-His6 RPC, mediated falls in both mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that this delivery system could be developed for potential therapies for viral hepatitis."

CD008122,0,8418064,0,A prospective study of the association between the human humoral immune response to Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigen gp190 and control of malarial infections.,"The human humoral immune response to the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface antigen gp190 was analyzed to determine the rate of reinfection by the parasite and the ability to control parasite density. The prospective study was carried out in a West African village where malaria is hyperendemic. No correlation between the antibody titers and protection against infection was observed within the group of children. Positive and negative associations of antibody specificities with protection against and/or control of parasitemia were, however, found for adolescents and adults, respectively. Thus, in adolescents, the presence of antibodies to gp190 fragment M6 correlates with a 50% reduced risk of P. falciparum infection and an increased ability to control parasitemia, whereas in adults, the humoral response to some of the polymorphic regions of gp190 associates with an increased risk of infection."

Evidence that the protein (PK66/AMA-1) from the simian parasite Plasmodium knowlesi was protective in rhesus monkeys suggested that the 83kDa P. falciparum equivalent (PF83/AMA-1) should be investigated for protective effects in humans. Here we briefly review pertinent comparative data, and describe the use of an eukaryotic full length recombinant PF83/AMA-1 molecule to develop a sensitive ELISA for the determination of serological responses in endemic populations. The assay has revealed surprisingly high levels of humoral response to this quantitatively minor antigen. We also show that PK66/AMA-1 inhibitory mAb's are active against merozoites subsequent to release from schizont-infected red cells, further implicating AMA-1 molecules in red cell invasion."
CD008122,0,18160449,1,Rapid diagnosis of vivax malaria by the SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test when thrombocytopenia is present.,"An easy and reliable diagnostic method for malaria is highly desirable. We examined the recently introduced SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test, which detects Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase, with the additional aid of the presence or absence of thrombocytopenia to diagnose vivax malaria. We enrolled 732 patients with clinically suspected malaria in an area where vivax malaria is endemic. We performed microscopic examination of thin film, applied the SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test, and checked platelet counts. One hundred ninety-five patients were smear positive for vivax malaria. The sensitivity of the SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test was 96.4%, and its specificity was 98.9%. We found that 95.4% of malaria patients had thrombocytopenia, and the proportion with malaria increased as platelet counts decreased. A positive SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test when thrombocytopenia was present showed a 100% positive predictive value for vivax malaria. In conclusion, the SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test is a rapid and accurate diagnostic method for vivax malaria, and a platelet count can facilitate a rapid diagnosis of malaria."
CD008122,0,10561760,1,A comparison of antigen dipstick assays with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and blood film examination in the rapid diagnosis of malaria.,"Early diagnosis of malaria for military personnel training in the field is crucial in providing proper treatment for the infected and in taking appropriate preventive measures for the non-infected. Present preliminary diagnosis of malaria in the field depends on the clinical symptoms of the patients and there is a need for rapid diagnosis of malaria in the field. The presence of drug-resistant strains of the Plasmodium species in the region also increases the urgency of finding a quick and sensitive way of identifying the different strains. This study evaluated current methods available for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The dipstick assays, the ParaSight F test and the OptiMAL malaria rapid test were compared with the methods of microscopic examination of blood film and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On comparison to the blood film and PCR methods, the ParaSight F test has specificity of 98.6% and sensitivity of 91% for P. falciparum detection. The OptiMAL malaria rapid test has a specificity of 100% and 98.6% and sensitivity of 92.8% and 92.6% for P. vivax and P. falciparum detection respectively. We conclude that both tests are suitable for use for rapid malaria diagnosis in the field but the OptiMAL rapid malaria test, which can detect both vivax and falciparum malaria, would be more useful."
CD008122,0,11422960,0,PCR-based ELISA technique for malaria diagnosis of specimens from Thailand.,"We performed a field evaluation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISA) for the diagnosis of malaria. A commercially available PCR-ELISA microplate hybridization (MPH) assay was used. Blood specimens were collected from 300 volunteers seeking care at malaria clinics in Thailand. Examination of 200 high power fields by Giemsa-stained thick and thin smear (GTTS) revealed 51 P. falciparum (Pf), 45 P. vivax (Pv), seven mixed Pf-Pv infections. These plus a random sample of 48 GTTS-negative specimens were selected for this study. All 151 specimens were processed for parasite DNA extraction and assayed by PCR-MPH. The target DNA sequence of the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSUrRNA) gene was amplified by PCR and hybridized with species-specific probes for Pf, Pv, P. malariae (Pm) and P. ovale (Po) immobilized in the wells of the microtiter plate and detected by colorimetric assay. Colour development was assessed at an optical density (OD) of 405 nm. An absorbance reading of > or = 0.1 was used as a positive cut-off. In comparison with GTTS results, PCR-MPH sensitivity was 91.4% (53/58, 95% CI 84.2-98.6) for Pf, 94.2% (49/52, 87.9-100) for Pv and specificity was 95.8% (46/48, 95% CI 90.2-100). There was statistically significant positive correlation between parasite densities < or = 7000/microl blood and absorbance reading, suggestive of PCR-MPH being semiquantitative. PCR-MPH also detected additional Pf and Pv cases as well as Pm and Po."

Besides, association of malaria with HIV/AIDS from a clinical point of view can be clinically severe in the face of the occurrence of other microorganisms or neoplasias, which worsens the evolution and prognosis of the affected patients. The concurrence of HIV with Plasmodium in malaria endemic zones is a possibility which should always be taken into consideration, since transmission is related to risk factors caused by people's behavior which are not always promptly revealed and/or identified.

CD008122,0,7504999,0,Analysis of a human monoclonal antibody reactive with multiple Plasmodium falciparum antigen repeat sequences using a solid phase affinity assay.,"A solid-phase affinity assay was set up for the determination of the affinity of the interaction between the human monoclonal antibody (mAb) 33G2 and peptides corresponding to repeated sequences in three blood stage antigens of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The epitope of this mAb is of interest due to the parasite blocking capacity of the mAb. Previous studies with PEPSCAN have defined the minimal epitope for the mAb as the pentapeptide VTEEI, a sequence frequently found in antigen Pf332. In the previous study, epitopes responsible for the cross-reactivity of the mAb with antigens Pf155/RESA and Pf11.1 were also identified. In the affinity assay described herein, the mAb was coated on a solid phase and binding of a labelled peptide was displaced by homologous or heterologous peptides. The affinity of peptides corresponding to Pf332 increased with increasing length, and the highest affinity was displayed by a dimer (23 amino acids) of a Pf332 repeat (K = 1.9 x 10(8) M-1). Peptide length did not influence the binding of peptides corresponding to the Pf155/RESA and Pf11.1 repeats, which had lower affinities comparable to that of the shortest Pf332 octapeptide (K = 2.2 x 10(4) M-1). Only peptides containing binding sites as defined by PEPSCAN analysis showed a measurable binding. When using peptides as inhibitors in peptide ELISA, binding correlated with the affinity of the peptides, but only the high affinity peptides were inhibitory. In contrast, a poor correlation was found when peptides were used directly for coating in ELISA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008122,0,9529722,0,Clinical signs for the recognition of children with moderate or severe anaemia in western Kenya.,"Optimal treatment of Plasmodium falciparum-related paediatric anaemia can result in improved haematological recovery and survival. Clinical predictors are needed to identify children with anaemia in settings where laboratory measurements are not available. The use of conjunctival (eyelid), palmar, nailbed, and tongue pallor to detect children with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin, 5.0-7.9 g/dl) or severe anaemia (haemoglobin, < 5.0 g/dl) was evaluated among children seen at an outpatient and inpatient setting in a hospital in western Kenya. Severe nailbed or severe palmar pallor had the highest sensitivity (62% and 60%, resp.), compared with severe conjunctival pallor (sensitivity = 31%), to detect children with severe anaemia in the outpatient setting. Children with moderate anaemia were best identified by the presence of nailbed or palmar pallor (sensitivity = 90% for both signs), compared with conjunctival pallor (sensitivity = 81%). Clinical signs of respiratory distress, in addition to the presence of severe pallor, did not increase the recognition of children requiring hospitalization for severe anaemia. Among inpatients, the sensitivity of severe nailbed pallor (59%) was highest for detecting children with severe anaemia, although the sensitivity of severe conjunctival pallor and severe palmar pallor was the same (53% for both signs). Presence of conjunctival pallor (sensitivity = 74%) was similar in sensitivity to both nailbed and palmar pallor (70% for both signs) among children with moderate anaemia. The sensitivity of tongue pallor was low among all children evaluated. Low haemoglobin levels were significantly associated with the likelihood of being smear-positive for P. falciparum. This study demonstrates that clinical criteria can be used to identify children with moderate and severe anaemia, thus enabling implementation of treatment algorithms. Children aged < 36 months who live in an area with P. falciparum malaria should receive treatment with an effective antimalarial drug if they have pallor."

Plasmodium vivax antigen was detected in seven specimens and P. falciparum in 21 specimens, together representing 0.4% of the 7,938 specimens tested. In one village, Palao-U, circumsporozoite antigen was detected in 16 (0.7%) of the 2,196 specimens tested. In this village, combined rates of infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax were 0.6% for An. minimus, 1.1% for An. sawadwongporni, and 1.5% for An. maculatus. Circumsporozoite antigen was also detected in An. dirus, An. nivipes, An. barbirostris group, and An. hyrcanus group specimens. Combined P. falciparum and P. vivax entomologic inoculation rates in the wet season (March-October) were 0.05 for An. minimus, An. maculatus, and An. dirus, but 0 for An. sawadwongporni. Rates were higher in the dry season (November-February): 0.26 for An. minimus, 0.13 for An. maculatus, 0.13 for An. sawadwongporni, and 0 for An. dirus. The vectorial capacity, calculated based on human biting rate and rate of survival, of An. minimus during the dry season was more than two-fold higher than that of An. maculatus, the species with the second highest vectorial capacity."
CD008122,0,15119077,0,How specific is the immune response to malaria in adults living in endemic areas?,"It is documented that people living in malaria endemic areas acquire immunity against malaria after repeated infections. Studies involving passive transfer of IgG from immune adults to the nonimmune subjects have shown that circulating antibodies play an important role, and that immune adults possess protective antibodies, which susceptible malaria patients do not. Through a differential immunoscreen, we have identified several novel cDNA clones, which react exclusively and yet extensively with immune sera samples. Specific antisera raised against the immunoclones inhibit the growth of parasites in culture. The clones studied so far turn out to be novel conserved Plasmodium genes. In order to study the response of sera of adults from malaria endemic areas of India and Africa to these immunogens, we carried out ELISA assays using these immunopeptides, other P. falciparum specific antigens, peptides, antigens from other infections such as mycobacterial infections and other proteins such as BSA. Children from the same areas and normal healthy urban people showed very little activity to each of these categories. A large percentage of adults from endemic areas responded positively to all the malarial immunogens tested. However, the same persons also showed high response to other antigens and proteins as well. The implications of these results are reported in this paper."
CD008122,0,11773110,1,Evaluation of the OptiMAL rapid antigen test and species-specific PCR to detect placental Plasmodium falciparum infection at delivery.,"During pregnancy, Plasmodium falciparum infection of the placenta frequently occurs in the absence of parasites in peripheral blood. We investigated the abilities of the OptiMAL rapid immunochromatographic strip test for P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase and species-specific PCR performed on peripheral blood to detect placental infection or malaria-associated low birth weight. Of 509 Malawian women screened by microscopy, 76 had malaria infection. Among these 509 women, the frequency of peripheral blood parasitemia was low. The OptiMAL test gave positive results in 37 of 171 women tested (one of whom had placental but not peripheral blood parasitemia) and had sensitivities of 71% for peripheral parasitemia and 38% for placental parasitemia compared to the microscopy values. The specificity for peripheral parasitemia was 94%. In 135 women, PCR had sensitivities of 94% for peripheral blood malaria detected by microscopy and 72% for placental infection. In samples examined by PCR, the prevalence of malaria in peripheral blood increased from 26.7% by microscopy to 51.9%. Women with placental malaria and women with malaria in peripheral blood samples by microscopy or OptiMAL testing, but not women with malaria detected only by PCR, had lower-birth-weight babies than did women without malaria by these criteria. Positive results by PCR in the absence of microscopic parasitemia were not associated with low birth weight. Neither OptiMAL nor PCR testing of peripheral blood is adequately sensitive to detect all placental malaria infection, but a positive result by OptiMAL testing identifies women with a high proportion of low-birth-weight babies."

All patients were tested for presence of HRP-II antigen of Plasmodium falciparum in their blood by the Parasight-F dipstick test by either an EDTA sample or a finger prick blood sample. The sensitivity of Parasight-F was 83.3 % However, the sensitivity of Parasight-F to detect Plasmodium Falciparum in case of mixed Plasmodium (Vivax + Falciparum) infection was only 25 %. Also, all patients less than 6 months of age had a negative Parasight-F test. Parasitic index, prior treatment with antimalarials or severity of Falciparum malaria have no effect on the sensitivity of Parasight-F test. We conclude that Parasight-F is an effective tool for diagnosis of Plasmoduim falciparum malaria in children."

Reports of significant variation in the field performance of RDTs based on the detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) (PfHRP2) and of significant sequence polymorphism in PfHRP2 led us to evaluate the binding of four HRP2-specific monoclonal antibodies (MABs) to parasite proteins from geographically distinct P. falciparum isolates, define the epitopes recognized by these MABs, and relate the copy number of the epitopes to MAB reactivity. We observed a significant difference in the reactivity of the same MAB to different isolates and between different MABs tested with single isolates. When the target epitopes of three of the MABs were determined and mapped onto the peptide sequences of the field isolates, significant variability in the frequency of these epitopes was observed. These findings support the role of sequence variation as an explanation for variations in the performance of HRP2-based RDTs and point toward possible approaches to improve their diagnostic sensitivities."
CD008122,0,6652962,0,Studies on the specificity of anti-erythrocyte antibodies in the serum of patients with malaria.,"Sera from patients with Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax or P. ovale malaria were selected according to their high levels of antibodies against human erythrocyte membranes as measured in a microELISA. The specificity of the anti-erythrocyte antibodies in these sera and two normal sera was investigated by means of an immunoblotting technique in combination with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All the patients' sera as well as the control sera contained antibodies against several erythrocyte polypeptides. As compared with normal sera, most malaria sera showed elevated levels of antibodies against polypeptides of 80K, 70K, 40K and 28K molecular weights. Two sera reacted strongly against a polypeptide with an electrophoretic mobility similar to the alpha subunit of spectrin. One serum showed strong reaction and several other sera, including normal sera, showed weak reaction against a 45K molecular weight polypeptide corresponding to actin. No pervading differences were seen in the pattern of specificities of the anti-erythrocyte ghost antibodies between sera from patients with P. falciparum, P. vivax or P. ovale infections."
CD008122,0,16436272,0,Selective lysis of erythrocytes infected with the trophozoite stage of Plasmodium falciparum by polyene macrolide antibiotics.,"The continuous increase in strains of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum resistant to most front-line antimalarial compounds is reason for grave clinical concern. The search for new drugs led us to investigate a number of membrane active polyene macrolide antibiotics, such as amphotericin B, nystatin, filipin and natamycin. The interaction of these compounds with sterols in bilayer cell membranes can lead to cell damage and ultimately cell lysis. The malaria parasite modifies the host erythrocyte membrane by changing the protein and lipid composition and thus the infected cell could be a selective target for membrane active compounds. We found that erythrocytes infected with the trophozoite stage of P. falciparum were particularly susceptible to lysis by amphotericin B (Fungizone) and, to a lesser extent, nystatin, as determined by ELISA and various microscopy assays. Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) displayed a similar specificity for parasitised erythrocytes, but complete lysis required a longer incubation period. In contrast, filipin and natamycin did not distinguish between normal and parasite-infected erythrocytes, but lysed both at similar concentrations. In addition, when added to ring-stage cultures, the amphotericin B preparations and nystatin produced a marked disruption in parasite morphology in less than 2 h without an accompanying permeabilisation of the infected host cell, suggesting a second plasmodicidal mode of action. The results imply that selected polyene macrolide antibiotics or their derivatives could find application in the treatment of severe malaria caused by of P. falciparum."

CD008122,0,12167092,0,Plasmodium falciparum: use of a NANP19 antibody-test for the detection of infection in non-immune travellers.,"Circumsporozoite (CS) antibodies are a reliable serological marker for the infection of Plasmodium falciparum. The purpose of this investigation was to construct and evaluate an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for the detection of CS antibodies. While the sensitivity of the newly developed test reached 78%, the specificity was 99%. In addition, the optimized kit was used to test for infection with P. falciparum in 1903 travellers that were recruited from a prospective study for malaria chemoprophylaxis. Sixty-six of the 1903 patients (3.5%) showed elevated CS antigen antibody titres. However, seroconversion could only be demonstrated in 18 (0.95%) patients. Among those seroconverting, there was a significantly higher percentage of male travellers (1.28%) than female travellers (0.56%). Positive reactions were more frequent among returnees from West and East Africa (1.49 and 1.14%, respectively) than among those from other endemic areas, e.g. South America (n=0). Despite its limited sensitivity, this newly developed kit for CS antibody testing may be a valuable tool for the estimation of the risk for travellers in malarious regions to acquire an infection with P. falciparum. It may also be useful for the determination of the efficacy of malaria chemoprophylaxis for inhibiting outbreak of disease."
CD008122,0,18320051,0,Identification and characterization of a novel Plasmodium falciparum merozoite apical protein involved in erythrocyte binding and invasion.,"Proteins that coat Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface and those secreted from its apical secretory organelles are considered promising candidates for the vaccine against malaria. In the present study, we have identified an asparagine rich parasite protein (PfAARP; Gene ID PFD1105w), that harbors a predicted signal sequence, a C-terminal transmembrane region and whose transcription and translation patterns are similar to some well characterized merozoite surface/apical proteins. PfAARP was localized to the apical end of the merozoites by GFP-targeting approach using an inducible, schizont-stage expression system, by immunofluorescence assays using anti-PfAARP antibodies. Immuno-electron microsopic studies showed that PfAARP is localized in the apical ends of the rhoptries in the merozoites. RBC binding assays with PfAARP expressed on COS cells surface showed that it binds to RBCs through its N-terminal region with a receptor on the RBC surface that is sensitive to trypsin and neuraminidase treatments. Sequencing of PfAARP from different P. falciparum strains as well as field isolates showed that the N-terminal region is highly conserved. Recombinant protein corresponding to the N-terminal region of PfAARP (PfAARP-N) was produced in its functional form in E. coli. PfAARP-N showed reactivity with immune sera from individuals residing in P. falciparum endemic area. The anti-PfAARP-N rabbit antibodies significantly inhibited parasite invasion in vitro. Our data on localization, functional assays and invasion inhibition, suggest a role of PfAARP in erythrocyte binding and invasion by the merozoite."

CD008122,0,9088430,0,"Seasonal variation of anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies directed against a repetitive peptide of gametocyte antigen pfs2400 in inhabitants in the State of Amapá, Brazil.","Antibodies to the Pfs2400 gametocyte antigen have been shown to inhibit the development of Plasmodium falciparum in anophelines and therefore this antigen is a candidate for a transmission-blocking vaccine. To test seasonal variation of these antibodies under field conditions, sera from 72 individuals were collected twice, first during the long-rains season with low malaria transmission and then, 6 months later, during the short-rains season, when transmission is high. This study was conducted in several localities in the State of Amapá, Brazil. All but three individuals had a positive indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) with asexual forms of P. falciparum. Most of them did not report malaria attacks during the period between the first and second sampling. Their sera were tested by IFAT with P. falciparum gametocytes. The overall positivity of this test did not vary between seasons, and was 47.2 (34/72) and 48.6% (35/72), respectively. The sera were also tested by ELISA with the Pfs2400 repeat peptide. The positivity rate dropped from 29.2 (21/72) to 15.3% (11/72) and the mean absorbancies from 0.623 to 0.354, when we compared the results of the long-rains and short-rains seasons. Fifteen out of the 21 ELISA positive sera turned negative, with no change of geometric mean of titres (GMT) of asexual IFAT, while five negatives became ELISA positive on second sampling, with increase of GMT. Soon after the second sampling a malaria outbreak was reported in one of the localities. These results point toward a relatively short persistence of anti-Pfs2400 repeat peptide antibodies, under natural field conditions. A gametocyte antigen booster before a high transmission period might contribute towards lowering malaria incidence by eliciting a partially effective antibody response."
CD008122,0,9231214,0,Short courses of ofloxacin for the treatment of enteric fever.,"Typhoid fever continues to be a major public health problem in tropical countries, exacerbated in recent years by the spread of multi-drug resistant strains of Salmonella typhi. Short treatment courses of fluoroquinolones are effective, and have the advantage of reduced cost and increased compliance, but the optimal length of treatment is unknown. In an open, randomized comparison, 107 adults with uncomplicated enteric fever (95 of whom had positive blood cultures for S. typhi and 5 for S. paratyphi) were treated with oral ofloxacin, 15 mg/kg/d for 2 d or 10 mg/kg/d for 3 d. Mean fever clearance times were the same in the 2 treatment groups (97 h). There were 7 treatment failures, one in the 2 d group and 6 in the 3 d group (P = 0.07). Three of the 5 patients infected with nalidixic acid resistant strains of S. typhi had treatment failures, compared with 4 of 90 with nalidixic acid sensitive isolates (P < 0.0001; relative risk 13.5, 95% confidence interval 4.1-43%). Treatment with ofloxacin for 2 or 3 d is equally effective in adults with uncomplicated enteric fever caused by nalidixic acid sensitive strains of S. typhi. The epidemiology and management of nalidixic acid resistent typhoid needs further investigation."
CD008122,0,6390807,0,Indirect ELISA test for malaria in blood donors.,"To determine the potential risk of transfusion malaria at the Hospital Militar Central in Bogota, Colombia, sera from 3114 blood donors were tested for malaria antibodies by the indirect ELISA technique. Positive results were found in 8.6 per thousand of the serum samples using P. falciparum antigen containing more than 60% mature forms as substrate. Three cases of transfusion-induced malaria were confirmed during the study. The first patient developed a P. vivax infection one week after the administration of one unit of infected blood. The other two patients received a red blood cell concentrate and a platelet preparation, respectively, derived from a single donor and developed a P. falciparum infection eight days after transfusion. The application of the ELISA technique would be of use in attempts to control transfusion-induced malaria."
CD008122,0,15741552,0,"A simple, high-throughput method to detect Plasmodium falciparum single nucleotide polymorphisms in the dihydrofolate reductase, dihydropteroate synthase, and P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter genes using polymerase chain reaction- and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based technology.","Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), and dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps), and chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) genes are used as molecular markers of P. falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and chloroquine. However, to be a practical tool in the surveillance of drug resistance, simpler methods for high-throughput haplotyping are warranted. Here we describe a quick and simple technique that detects dhfr, dhps, and Pfcrt SNPs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based technology. Biotinylated PCR products of dhfr, dhps, or Pfcrt were captured on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOPs) were hybridized with the PCR products. A stringent washing procedure enabled detection of remaining bound SSOPs and distinguished between the SNPs of dhfr, dhps, and Pfcrt with high specificity. The SSOP-ELISA compared well with a standard PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism procedure, and gave identical positive results in more than 90% of the P. falciparum slide-positive samples tested. The SSOP-ELISA of all dhfr, dhps, or Pfcrt SNPs on 88 samples can be performed in a single day and provides quick and reproducible results. The system can potentially be modified to detect SNPs in other genes."
CD008122,0,15741553,0,The search for effective and sustainable treatments for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa: a model of the selection of resistance by antifolate drugs and their combinations.,"The extensive data on the relationship between parasite genotype and susceptibility to antifolate drugs can now be coupled with pharmacokinetic information to allow construction of models of the selection and spread of antifolate-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. In this report, we have modeled the effect on resistance selection processes of combinations of antifolate antimalarial drugs with artesunate and with amodiaquine under a variety of conditions that can be defined by the user. The model is intended to assist policymakers in forecasting the useful therapeutic life (UTL) for a range of potential combination treatments. The model is especially designed for use by African malaria programs so that the interactions of key variables can be explored and appropriate combinations of drugs can be chosen for field testing. The model provides some important general conclusions: 1) for optimal extension of UTL, combination therapy must be deployed before either constituent drug is used as monotherapy; 2) even short periods of monotherapy can severely limit the usefulness of subsequent combination therapy; and 3) that adding a second drug to rescue an antifolate antimalarial that is overtly failing is an inappropriate and ultimately wasteful exercise."
CD008122,0,17060471,0,Role of monocyte-acquired hemozoin in suppression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in children with severe malarial anemia.,"Severe malarial anemia (SMA), caused by Plasmodium falciparum infections, is one of the leading causes of childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the molecular determinants of SMA are largely undefined, dysregulation in host-derived inflammatory mediators influences disease severity. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important regulator of innate inflammatory responses that has recently been shown to suppress erythropoiesis and promote pathogenesis of SMA in murine models. To examine the role of MIF in the development of childhood SMA, peripheral blood MIF production was examined in Kenyan children (aged <3 years, n = 357) with P. falciparum malarial anemia. All children in the study were free from bacteremia and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Since deposition of malarial pigment (hemozoin [Hz]) contributes to suppression of erythropoiesis, the relationship between MIF concentrations and monocytic acquisition of Hz was also examined in vivo and in vitro. Circulating MIF concentrations declined with increasing severity of anemia and significantly correlated with peripheral blood leukocyte MIF transcripts. However, MIF concentrations in peripheral blood were not significantly associated with reticulocyte production. Multivariate regression analyses, controlling for age, gender, and parasitemia, further revealed that elevated levels of pigment-containing monocytes (PCM) was associated with SMA and decreased MIF production. In addition, PCM levels were a better predictor of hemoglobin and MIF concentrations than parasite density. Additional experiments in malaria-naive individuals demonstrated that hemozoin caused both increased and decreased MIF production in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in a donor-specific manner, independent of apoptosis. However, PBMC MIF production in children with acute malaria progressively declined with increasing anemia severity. Results presented here demonstrate that acquisition of hemozoin by monocytes is associated with suppression of peripheral blood MIF production and enhanced severity of anemia in childhood malaria."

CD008122,0,2694494,0,"Two populations of women with high and low spleen rates living in the same area of Madang, Papua New Guinea, demonstrate different immune responses to malaria.","Specific malaria and total IgM antibody responses were measured in 2 linguistically distinct coastal Papua New Guinean populations living in the same endemic malarious area, but exhibiting different adult female spleen rates (51% and 30%), in order to establish whether the higher spleen rates in the former group were due to hyper-reactive malarious splenomegaly (HMS). Malaria parasite rates were comparable, and geometric mean titres of IgG malaria antibody were the same, in both groups, indicating comparable exposure to malaria. A higher mean total IgM was observed in the high spleen (HS) rate group (6.07 g/litre, compared with 4.62 g/litre), a higher proportion was seropositive for IgM antibody to Plasmodium falciparum (63% compared with 54%), and HMS was found rather more frequently (4.7% compared with 2.6%). In both groups total IgM concentrations increased significantly with rising parity, and the mean level of 5.27 g/litre in young nulliparous women from the HS group suggested that IgM levels in this group at least were elevated from childhood. In both groups a rise in total IgM was associated with higher P. falciparum IgM geometric mean titres of antibody activity, a fall in parasite rates (HS group: 30% to 15%, P = 0.02; LS group: 24% to 0%, P = 0.034), and higher spleen rates (HS group: 38% to 65%, P = 0.001; LS group: 20% to 67%, P = 0.00012). It is concluded that the difference in spleen rates between the 2 groups was the result of differing degrees of acquired immunity to malaria, probably due to genetic differences in immune responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008122,0,11003728,1,Use of dipstick tests for the rapid diagnosis of malaria in nonimmune travelers.,"Swift diagnosis of falciparum malaria in nonendemic areas is frequently complicated by lack of experience on the side of involved laboratory personnel. Diagnostic tools based on the dipstick principle for the detection of plasmodial histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2) (ICT Malaria P.f.

CD008122,0,1443341,0,Rapid in vivo detection of chloroquine resistance by the Quantitative Buffy Coat Malaria Diagnosis System.,"The use of the Giemsa-stained thick blood smear for the diagnosis of malaria has not been supplanted since the discovery of the parasite by A. Laveran in 1880. Recently, a new direct diagnosis technique, the Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC)* Malaria Diagnosis System, has been developed. We compared this technique with the thick blood smear diagnosis in a study of the efficacy of chloroquine therapy in Zaire. A total of 815 subjects were screened; 71 participated in the trial. They were given chloroquine at a dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight over three days and were examined for parasitemia two and seven days after treatment. Chloroquine resistance was detected in 38% of the subjects by thick blood smear and in 45% by the QBC test. Of greater interest was the time required for each diagnosis: an average of 17 min was required to examine microscopic fields with 1,000 leukocytes by thick blood smear analysis compared with less than one min by the QBC system. In addition, we did not observe diminished attention from fatigue by microscopists using the QBC system despite the large number of tests conducted. We conclude that the QBC system is an important tool for studies of drug resistance."
CD008122,0,16931409,1,The reliability of diagnostic techniques in the diagnosis and management of malaria in the absence of a gold standard.,"The accuracy of techniques for the diagnosis of malaria are usually compared with optical microscopy, which is considered to be a gold standard. However, microscopy is prone to error and therefore makes it difficult to assess the reliability of other diagnostic techniques. We did a systematic review to assess the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic techniques in different settings, using a statistical method that avoided defining a gold standard. Performance varied depending on species of the malaria parasite, level of parasitaemia, and immunity. Overall, histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based dipsticks showed a high sensitivity (92.7%) and specificity (99.2%) for Plasmodium falciparum in endemic areas. The acridine orange test was more sensitive (97.1%) in detecting P falciparum in epidemiological studies, with a specificity of 97.9%. In the absence of a gold standard, HRP2 dipsticks and acridine orange could provide an alternative for detecting falciparum infections in endemic areas and epidemiological studies, respectively. Microscopy still remains more reliable in detecting non-falciparum infections."
CD008122,0,10432064,0,Relationships between malaria prevalence and malaria-related morbidity in school children from two villages in central Africa.,"To investigate the relationship between parasite prevalence and malaria-related morbidity, we carried out a comparative study among cohorts of school children from two villages, Dienga, Gabon, and Pouma, Cameroon, both located in malaria-endemic areas. Seven to 17 year-old children attending primary schools were similarly followed-up at each site to evaluate the frequency of malaria attacks. Follow-up involved daily temperature recording (and blood smears in the case of fever) and preparation of blood smears every two weeks. In Pouma, 186 children were followed-up for six months. In Dienga, 228 children were followed-up for nine months. The mean prevalence rate of Plasmodium falciparum infections (as assessed by the blood smears) was twice as high in Pouma compared with Dienga (45.2% versus 26.8%; P < 0.0001), whereas the monthly malaria attack rate (as assessed by the daily surveillance) was twice as high in Dienga compared with Pouma (21.5% versus 41.4%; P = 0.003). The possible implication of several parameters that may differ between the two areas, such as the malaria transmission level, the economical and social status of the inhabitants, the characteristics of infecting parasite strains, and the genetic background of the population, is discussed."

For 14,150 adults of An. albimanus, captured at five locations in Guatemala, we report sporozoite antigen rates of 0.03-0.57%, which correlate with the malaria prevalences at the study sites.

CD008122,0,11591804,0,Unique T cell effector functions elicited by Plasmodium falciparum epitopes in malaria-exposed Africans tested by three T cell assays.,"Natural immunity to malaria is characterized by low level CD4 T cell reactivity detected by either lymphoproliferation or IFN-gamma secretion. Here we show a doubling in the detection rate of responders to the carboxyl terminus of circumsporozoite protein (CS) of Plasmodium falciparum by employing three T cell assays simultaneously: rapid IFN-gamma secretion (ex vivo ELISPOT), IFN-gamma secretion after reactivation of memory T cells and expansion in vitro (cultured ELISPOT), and lymphoproliferation. Remarkably, for no individual peptide did a positive response for one T cell effector function correlate with any other. Thus these CS epitopes elicited unique T cell response patterns in malaria-exposed donors. Novel or important epitope responses may therefore be missed if only one T cell assay is employed. A borderline correlation was found between anti-CS Ab levels and proliferative responses, but no correlation was found with ex vivo or cultured IFN-gamma responses. This suggested that the proliferating population, but not the IFN-gamma-secreting cells, contained cells that provide help for Ab production. The data suggest that natural immunity to malaria is a complex function of T cell subgroups with different effector functions and has important implications for future studies of natural T cell immunity."
CD008122,0,1725821,0,Epitopes of the Plasmodium falciparum clustered-asparagine-rich protein (CARP) recognized by human T-cells and antibodies.,"Linear B- and T-cell epitopes have been identified in the Plasmodium falciparum clustered-asparagine-rich-protein (CARP). Twenty-six synthetic peptides, 15-25 amino acids in length, were assayed for their ability to stimulate purified, human T-cells primed to P.falciparum by natural infection to proliferate and/or secrete gamma-interferon (IFN gamma). The plasma of malaria exposed individuals were tested for antibody reactivity with peptides coupled to bovine serum albumin in a semiquantitative ELISA. Two of the peptides (NNFMNRNMKNKNMN/NAKNVNDMYRDGEMS) induced T-cells from many malaria exposed donors to proliferate and/or secrete-IFN gamma. Six peptides bound antibodies from a large number of the plasma samples, the amounts ranging from ten to more than 200 micrograms specific antibody/ml. T-cell activation was most pronounced when the T-cells were from highly immune donors. In contrast, high anti-peptide specific antibody levels were usually detected in the plasma of less immune donors, recently exposed to infection. One short sequence (NAKNVNDMYRDGEMS) was found to contain both T- and B-cell epitopes. Thus, CARP includes both T- and B-cell reactive elements recognized by the human immune system following exposure to the parasite by natural infection."

We conducted an open-label, staggered-start, dose-escalating Phase I trial in 23 malaria-naïve volunteers who received 8, 20 or 40microg of FMP2.1 in a fixed volume of 0.5mL of AS02A on a 0, 1, and 2 month schedule. Nineteen of 23 volunteers received all three scheduled immunizations. The most frequent solicited local and systemic adverse events associated with immunization were injection site pain (68%) and headache (29%). There were no significant laboratory abnormalities or vaccine-related serious adverse events. All volunteers seroconverted after second immunization as determined by ELISA. Immune sera recognized sporozoites and merozoites by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and exhibited both growth inhibition and processing inhibition activity against homologous (3D7) asexual stage parasites. Post-immunization, peripheral blood mononuculear cells exhibited FMP2.1-specific lymphoproliferation and IFN-gamma and IL-5 ELISPOT assay responses. This is the first PfAMA-1-based vaccine shown to elicit both potent humoral and cellular immunity in humans. Encouraged by the potential of FMP1/AS02A to target host immunity against PfAMA-1 that is known to be expressed by sporozoite, hepatic and erythrocytic stages, we have initiated field trials of FMP2.1/AS02A in an endemic population in the Republic of Mali."

The confirmed leptospirosis serum panel included paired acute- and convalescent-phase specimens from 40 cases, of which 34 gave positive latex tests (case sensitivity, 85%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 70 to 94%). The other diseases represented in the panel of 112 specimens from nonleptospirosis patients included autoimmune diseases, brucellosis, dengue, melioidosis, malaria, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, viral hepatitis, and a number of other viral infections. The specificity of latex agglutination using this panel was 81% (95% CI, 73 to 87%). Among the patients with acute febrile illness, there were 25 cases of leptospirosis and 161 patients with other diagnoses. The sensitivity and specificity of latex agglutination in this group were 88% (95% CI, 72 to 97%) and 98% (95% CI, 95 to 100%), respectively. In this evaluation, the two distinct groups of specimens gave similar results for sensitivity, but specificity was different in each study. The sensitivity and specificity observed for the hospital study were similar to those obtained in evaluations of other rapid tests in the same population. The results of this study suggest that multiple evaluations of new diagnostic assays should be performed, because performance characteristics may vary in different populations."

Measuring the burden of malaria during pregnancy usually involves determining the prevalence of placental malaria infection through microscopic examination of placental blood films, a difficult and error-prone process. A number of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria have been developed, most of them immunochromatographic dipstick assays. However, none have been tested for the direct determination of malaria antigen in placental blood. We undertook an evaluation of the Malaria Rapid Test (MAKROmed in determining placental malaria infection. The prevalence of placental parasitemia was 22.6% by microscopy, 51.0% by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and 43.1% by RDT. When the PCR was used as the gold standard, RDTs had a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 76%.

Our study was conducted during November 2007-January 2008 to assess test accuracy of an RDT in the management of febrile outpatients in a peripheral urban health facility in Cameroon. We found the overall sensitivity to be 71.4% and a specificity of 82.2%; the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 73.8% and 80.4%, respectively. False-negative and false-positive cases represented 11.8% and 10.5% of all febrile patients. Malaria alone (31.3%) was the first cause of fever; 33.5% of fever cases were of unknown origin. Acute respiratory infections were common among children 0-2 years of age (25.5%) and decreased with age. The risk of having a clinical failure with the presumptive treatment of febrile children was seven times greater than that of the RDT-oriented management (relative risk = 6.8, 95% confidence interval = 0.88-53.4, P = 0.03) because of the delay of appropriate treatment of non-malarial febrile illness. Our results suggest that the RDT may be of limited utility for children greater than five years of age and adults and that diagnosis based on microscopic examination of blood smears should be recommended for these patient populations, as well as in areas of low transmission."

(ICT-diagnostic). Comparison with the reference method (thin and thick blood smears assessed by two experienced parasitologists) showed that both tests were highly sensitive (93% and 96% respectively) and specific (98% and 98% respectively). The positive predictive values of the two tests were equal (96%) and the negative predicative values were close (96% and 98% respectively). Although both tests provided results within 10 minutes and required no special equipment for interpretation, the ICT-Malaria P.f. test seemed simpler and easier to use than the ParaSight-F test. The ParaSight-F test alone was used to monitor serum antigen levels after treatment in 24 patients. Antigen levels remained positive for at least three days after disappearance of circulating parasites (range: 3 to 28 days). Evaluation of serum levels of HRP-2 antigens can be useful for emergency diagnosis, especially in patients with low circulating parasite levels.

CD008122,0,14513934,1,Rapid immunochromatographic diagnosis and Rolling Back Malaria--experiences from an African control program.,"Malaria is a re-emerging disease in much of Africa. In response, the World Health Organization launched the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) initiative. One of six key principles adopted is the early detection of malaria cases. However, the importance of definitive diagnosis and potential value of field deployment of rapid malaria tests in RBM has been largely ignored. The Lowveld Region of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, is home to a predominantly non-immune population, of approximately 850000 inhabitants, who are at risk of seasonal Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Malaria treatment in this area is usually only initiated on detection of malaria parasites in the peripheral bloodstream, as many other rickettsial and viral febrile illness mimic malaria. The malaria control programme traditionally relied on light microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick blood films for malaria diagnosis. This review summarizes operational research findings that led to the introduction of rapid malaria card tests for primary diagnosis of malaria throughout the Mpumalanga malaria area. Subsequent operational research and extensive experience over a four-year period since introducing the ICT Malaria Pf test appears to confirm the local appropriateness of this diagnostic modality. A laboratory is not required and clinic staff are empowered to make a prompt definitive diagnosis, limiting delays in initiating correct therapy. The simple, accurate and rapid non-microscopic means now available for diagnosing malaria could play an important role in Rolling Back Malaria in selected areas."

For the child to be born, continuing progress in genotypic diagnosis often leads to very delicate questions during the antenatal period, especially since certain diagnoses are still difficult and prognosis less than sure. The wide range of tools in molecular genetics may provide the answer in many situations. The rapid development of genetic tools in developed countries should now raise the question of their use in developing countries. This point might have a particular impact in research on genetic factors and sensibility to frequent infectious diseases such as tuberculosis or malaria.

The collections produced a total of 13,591 anophelines belonging to 14 species. Using ELISA for circumsporozoite proteins of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum, Anopheles culicifacies, An. subpictus and An. varuna were incriminated as malaria vectors. For these species, estimated entomological inoculation rates were 5.9, 5.7, and 6.7 infective bites per person per year, respectively. An. culicifacies and An. subpictus show endophagic behavior, while An. varuna were exophagic. Mosquito larval surveys indicated that the gem pits, when filled with water, contributed 60% of the larvae of the three vector species. Parasitological data were collected by two mobile malaria clinics and by hospitals. The incidence rates of fever per 1,000 person-years with P. vivax and P. falciparum were 122.8 and 26.1 respectively, with a significantly higher rate in males over 15 years of age than in females of that age. Changes in the environment due to gem mining may have caused the emergence of An. subpictus and An. varuna as significant malaria vectors. The conventional view of An. culicifacies being the main vector of malaria in Sri Lanka needs to be reconsidered when planning the vector control programs in this study area. Due to migration of malaria patients, there is a likelihood the disease could be spread to other parts of the island. Therefore, action should be taken to eliminate these pits as breeding sites."

We recently identified in trophozoite-stage infected erythrocytes a novel high molecular weight erythrocyte membrane-associated protein of P. falciparum, PfEMP3, defined by Western blotting with the rat monoclonal antibody 12C11. Genomic clone lambda 12.1.3 and cDNA clone p12.2 contain nucleic acid sequences encoding PfEMP3. Analysis of Malayan Camp strain parasites by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 5% gels revealed that PfEMP3, defined by Western blot, has the same relative molecular weight (M(r)) as the surface-exposed protein PfEMP1 defined by cell surface iodination. We show here that PfEMP3 is distinct from PfEMP1 by three criteria. First, 125I-labeled PfEMP1 was resolved from PfEMP3 by extended migration on 4% gels. Second, in two strains of P. falciparum in which 125I-PfEMP1 has a different M(r), PfEMP3 had the same M(r). Third, immunization studies were performed with fusion proteins derived from clones lambda 12.1.3 and p12.2. Although one rabbit, Rb 05.75, immunized with the PfEMP3-derived fusion protein beta gal12.1.3, produced a serum that strongly immunoprecipitated PfEMP1 as well as PfEMP3, most sera immunoprecipitated only PfEMP3. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of PfEMP3 by Rb 05.75 serum was blocked by the glutathione S-transferase 12.1.3 fusion protein, whereas immunoprecipitation of PfEMP1 was unaffected. Therefore, we conclude that PfEMP1 and PfEMP3 are antigenically distinct."

The aim of this study was to examine the possible contribution of genetic variants in the TNF and FCGR2A genes in determining severity/resistance to P. falciparum malaria in Indian subjects.
CD008122,0,2672834,0,Differential non-responsiveness in humans of candidate Plasmodium falciparum vaccine antigens.,"Synthetic subunit vaccines to sporozoites, merozoites, and gametes are being developed for malaria. The vaccine strategy assumes that the population to be immunized will respond favorably to these vaccine antigens. Using sera of 35 adults and 50 children from the The Gambia, West Africa, where Plasmodium falciparum is highly endemic, we examined the humoral immune response to candidate malaria vaccine antigens from sporozoites, merozoites, and gametes. We observed widespread restricted immunogenicity to defined parasite antigens in children and adults. HLA typing of adult lymphocytes demonstrated a marked diversity in HLA haplotypes in this population. Our results and those from our studies in mice suggest that genetic factors may partly explain the immunological non-responsiveness. This may necessitate re-evaluation of the malaria vaccine strategy."

In addition to the usual febrile illnesses present in temperate climates, the patient may have an ""exotic"" infection, e.g., malaria, infectious hepatitis, enteric fever, or dengue fever. The potential causes of fever in travelers are extensive. This article provides practical clues to assist the physician in making the correct diagnosis--by using exposure information, symptoms and signs, and concomitant symptom complexes."

CD008122,0,3136958,0,Interleukin 2 receptor in patients with localized and systemic parasitic diseases.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify soluble interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) in the serum of patients with helminthic and protozoal infections. The results demonstrated that levels of IL-2R were normal in patients with helminthic infections limited to the intestinal tract (ascariasis, trichuriasis), but significantly elevated in patients with systemic or long-lasting infections (strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis, fascioliasis, opisthorchiasis). In patients infected with Schistosoma mansoni levels of IL-2R were higher in those with the hepatosplenic than in those with the intestinal form of the disease. Patients with malaria also showed increased serum levels of IL-2R, irrespective whether the infection was caused by Plasmodium falciparum or P. vivax. No difference was observed between patients with acute or history of malaria. The highest levels of IL-2R were observed in patients with visceral leishmaniasis. Interestingly, in these patients the concentration of IL-2R correlated to specific antibody titre. The results are discussed in the context of preferential activation of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and/or macrophages during the course of the different parasitic infections investigated."

CD008122,0,18302850,0,Current investigations and treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa.,"We reviewed the scientific literature on Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) in Africa in order to provide information on the current status of clinical care and the existing research challenges. BL epidemiology led to the discovery of the Epstein Barr virus, an important cause of several viral illnesses and malignancies. The incidence of BL has increased in the endemic areas of Africa, overlapping with the epidemic of HIV and increase of malaria. The impact of this on the clinical care of BL in the region is therefore of interest, especially in HIV-infected children. Rapid methods must be developed which enable the correct diagnosis to be made. It is important to improve supportive care to allow fairly aggressive treatment, to research into salvage therapy for those who fail first-line treatment, and to develop less toxic drug combinations for HIV-infected patients. Documentation of HIV status through counselling should be offered to all patients."
CD008122,0,18645936,0,Investigation of malaria in blood donors and comparison of the optimal rapid malaria test to the classical method.,"Malaria is still a problem in the southeastern region of Turkey despite all the effort to eradicate the disease. The spread of malaria is by the transfer of agents by mosquitoes, transfusions of blood and blood products, organ transplantations from infected individuals and the use of contaminated injectors. The numerical load of parasites in infected donors may be very low, therefore no clinical symptoms may be observed and Plasmodium species may live in the body of donors for years. As the agents may live long in the body of donors, the blood from donors must be examined thoroughly for agents. The aim of this study was to determine whether malaria which is endemic in our region is transmitted by transfusion products. The blood from 1850 donors, who presented at the Dicle University Faculty of Medicine Blood Bank (Diyarbakir) in 2006, was examined by the optimal rapid malaria test and by Giemsa stained preparations. No pathogens were detected by any of these methods. In conclusion, the screening tests for malaria may be useful but not sufficiently sensi-tive for blood banks. In endemic regions; a more specific questionnaire and physical examination can be used to exclude blood donors who are at the risk of malaria."
CD008122,0,2095632,0,Evaluation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent and alternative assays for detection of HIV antibodies using panels of Brazilian sera.,"Sera from 472 Brazilian subjects, confirmed to be either positive or negative for HIV antibodies and comprising the total clinical spectrum of HIV infection, were utilized in the evaluation of six commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), as well as of four alternative assays, namely indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), passive hemagglutination (PHA), dot blot and Karpas AIDS cell test. The sensitivities ranged from 100% (Abbott and Roche ELISA) to 84.2% (PHA) and the specificities ranged from 99.3% (IIF) to 80.2% (PHA). The sensitivity and specificity of the PHA and the sensitivity of the Karpas cell test were significantly lower than those of the other tests. Although the IFF and dot blot had good sensitivities and specificities, the six ELISA were more attractive than those tests when other parameters such as ease of reading and duration of assay were considered."
CD008122,0,16491946,0,Zinc: an essential trace element with potential benefits to soldiers.,"Zinc is a trace element known to be an essential nutrient for life. It functions as a cofactor for numerous enzymes, including those involved in DNA and RNA replication and protein synthesis. Soldiers represent a unique population faced with intense metabolic and mental demands, as well as exposure to various immune challenges. Some of these factors may affect their dietary zinc requirements. Although severe zinc deficiency is unlikely to occur, some soldiers may experience less than optimal zinc status because of diminished intake coupled with increased requirements. For those soldiers, supplemental dietary zinc may serve a protective function in numerous disease states affecting modern warfighters. This review highlights the importance of adequate zinc nutriture to soldiers and discusses the potential benefits of supplemental zinc in a number of diseases currently affecting soldiers, including diarrhea, respiratory diseases, malaria, and leishmaniasis."

Using IFAT-IgG both antigens gave high sensitivities and were statistically similar, being 89.5% with La and 100% with Lb. Using ELISA, the highest sensitivity was achieved with total IgG for ML (94.7% with both antigens) and MCL (100% with both antigens). Cross-reactivity, observed with Chagas disease and malaria sera reduced the specificity of the IgG-based assays, being 50 to 70% with IFAT and 40 to 70% with ELISA. An increase in specificity was obtained with IgG1-ELISA (90% with Lb and 100% with La). Serum levels of anti-Lb-IgG and IgG3 dropped 90 days after treatment. IgG subclasses antibody detection constitute an valuable alternative to increase the efficiency of sorological diagnostics of ML/MCL."

A questionnaire of risk factors for Hepatitis B and C was undertaken. All blood donors had been previously screened for HIV antibody without any positive cases recorded. 598 donors had serum collected of which 36 samples (6.0%) were third generation HCV EIA antibody positive and 3 samples were RIBA positive but none were PCR positive. 25.1% of samples were positive for HBsAg and anti-HBc antibody was found in 84.4%. Elevated ALT levels (>35 U/l) were found in 6.5% of samples but there was no statistically significant association with HCV or HBsAg status. 15.4% were TPHA positive and 5.4% had RPR titers more than or equal to 1. Anti-HTLV-1 antibody was positive in 12.3% randomly selected samples. All 10 positive samples were then found to be antibody indeterminate with Western blot assay. Of the 585 samples with completed questionnaires, analysis of the relationship between anti-HCV status with tattoo status and ear piercing also failed to reach statistical significance. Consistent with other studies from tropical malaria-prone countries, a positive anti-HCV antibody test even by the third generation EIA is probably a false positive test in most cases. In addition, high prevalence rates of HBV, yaws or syphilis infection were demonstrated."

The three methods used for mosquito collection were light traps, pyrethrum spray catches, and pit shelter collections. All anopheline mosquitoes that were collected belonged to the Anopheles gambiae complex and they were identified by PCR as the sibling species Anopheles arabiensis (Patton). Apart from An. arabiensis, the only other mosquitoes caught were culicines. The vector population increased greatly for about a month after the start of the rains. The anthropophilic indices obtained from the blood-fed An. arabiensis resting indoors and outdoors were only 20% and 25%, respectively, with most of the other meals on goats. ELISA for P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein revealed only one positive out of 1,026 tested. The malaria prevalence among children <10 years was only 3.3% (all P.falciparum) from 300 slides examined. These low rates seem to reflect recent success in malaria control in Eritrea."

CD008122,0,14513430,0,Changes in the levels of chemokines and cytokines in the placentas of women with Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes often are sequestered in the placenta and stimulate the accumulation of maternal mononuclear cells. In this study, the role that chemokines and cytokines play in mediating the inflammatory response was investigated. Placental parasites elicited a statistically significant increase in the levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-10, in plasma collected from the intervillous space. Explants of fetal tissue from malaria-positive placentas also secreted significantly enhanced amounts of IFN-gamma. Culture supernatant of maternal intervillous leukocytes obtained from infected placentas contained significantly higher levels of TNF-alpha, IL-10, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and IFN-gamma inducible protein-10 than did cultures of white blood cells obtained from uninfected placentas. Taken together, these results show that both fetal and maternal cells secrete inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines in response to P. falciparum and suggest that beta-chemokines produced by maternal cells contribute to the accumulation of macrophages in the intervillous space."

We compared microscopy with rapid antigen testing for detecting asymptomatic parasitemia. Nine of 103 (8.7%) had malaria by polymerase chain reaction (blood smear and rapid testing had a sensitivity of 22%). The empiric treatment program has decreased the rate of imported asymptomatic malaria. Blood film and rapid antigen testing are poor screening tests."

Between the surveys, a clinically and parasitologically passive surveillance was established in this community and 48 malaria attacks (28 due to Plasmodium falciparum and 20 due to Plasmodium vivax) were recorded in this cohort of 50 subjects. Serum samples were collected at each survey and tested by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) for IgG, IgG subclass and IgM antibodies against P. falciparum exoantigens isolated from culture supernatants and detergent-soluble somatic antigens. As expected, both anti-malarial IgG and IgM antibody titres were shown to rise after a malaria outbreak observed during the follow-up period. Nevertheless, in marked contrast with the profile of anti-malarial IgG subclasses described for semi-immune Africans, in this Amazonian community IgG2 antibodies (that are non-cytophilic) against both antigens were shown to predominate over other IgG subclasses. Such overall predominance of IgG2 subclass titres was statistically significant concerning exoantigens, but was of borderline significance in relation to IgG1 antibodies against somatic antigens (p = 0.052). Moreover, highly variable patterns of boosting were observed in antibody responses against both antigens among the patients who suffered P. falciparum malaria attack during the study."
CD008122,0,15582527,0,Malarial anaemia: mechanisms and implications of insufficient erythropoiesis during blood-stage malaria.,"It has been proposed that the basis of severe malarial anaemia, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in endemic areas, is multifactorial. Inappropriately low reticulocytosis is observed in malaria patients suggesting that insufficient erythropoiesis is a major factor. Clinical studies provide conflicting data concerning the production of adequate levels of erythropoietin (EPO) during malaria. Plasmodium chabaudi AS causes non-lethal infection in resistant C57BL/6 mice, and lethal infection in susceptible A/J mice. In P. chabaudi AS infected C57BL/6 and A/J mice, which experience varying degrees of severity of anaemia, kidney EPO production is appropriate to the severity of anaemia and is regulated by haematocrit level. Neutralisation of endogenous EPO during infection leads to lethal anaemia while timely administration of exogenous EPO rescues mice although reticulocytosis is suppressed in proportion to the parasitemia level. Characterisation of alterations in splenic erythroid compartments in naive and P. chabaudi AS infected A/J mice revealed that infection, with or without EPO treatment, leads to sub-optimal increases in TER119+ erythroblasts compared to EPO-treated naive mice. A lower percentage of TER119+ erythroblasts in infected mice undergo terminal differentiation to become mature haemoglobin-producing cells. Furthermore, there is a shift in transferrin receptor (CD71) expression from TER119+ cells to a non-erythroid population. Deficiencies in the number and maturation of TER119+ erythroblasts during infection coincide with blunted proliferation to EPO stimulation in vitro by splenocytes, although a high frequency express EPO receptor (EPOR). Together, these data suggest that during malaria, EPO-induced proliferation of early EPOR+ erythroid progenitors is suppressed, leading to sub-optimal generation of TER119+ erythroblasts. Moreover, a shift in CD71 expression may result in impaired terminal maturation of erythroblasts. Thus, suppressed proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of erythroid precursors in association with inadequate reticulocytosis may be the basis of insufficient erythropoiesis during malaria."

CD008122,0,6998590,0,A longitudinal study of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the West African savannah using the ELISA technique.,"Malarial antibody levels were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in two West African populations, one exposed to intense malaria transmission and the other protected. The results reflected the transmission of maternal antibody and, in the unprotected population, the subsequent increase of the ELISA values with age reflected the development of the immune response to malaria. Malaria control activities reduced ELISA values in the protected population. The limitations of the ELISA test used in this study are shown by the fact that numerous infants with previous proven parasitaemia were ELISA-negative. Purified antigens are needed to improve the ELISA test for use in serological surveys of malaria."
CD008122,0,7872440,0,"Polymerase chain reaction and a liquid-phase, nonisotopic hybridization for species-specific and sensitive detection of malaria infection.","In the present study, we describe a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of malaria infection. The target region of the 18S ribosomal DNA is amplified by a PCR using an 18S rRNA, genus-specific, biotinylated (5') and an unlabeled primer (3') pair. The detection probes are digoxigenin-labeled DNA oligonucleotides derived from species-specific rRNA sequences. The amplified fragments are allowed to hybridize with the species-specific, digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes. The oligo/DNA complex is allowed to bind onto streptavidin-coated microtiter plates, followed by incubation with a peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate and a colorimetric-peroxidase substrate. The resulting test demonstrated specificity for the four human Plasmodium species, and was able to detect a level of parasitemia of at least 0.0001% in a laboratory-induced P. falciparum infection in monkeys. This liquid hybridization assay is sensitive, specific, simple, and reliable, with wide applicability in epidemiologic studies, accurate detection of mixed infections, detection of low-level parasitemia, and evaluation of chemotherapy and vaccine efficacy."

The availability of specific information on the vector-borne disease threat (e.g., presence or absence of a specific disease agent, temporal and geographic distribution of competent vectors, and vector infection rates) allows for effective implementation of appropriate measures to protect our deployed military forces. Vector diagnostics can provide critical, real-time information crucial to establishing effective vector prevention/control programs. In this article we provide an overview of current vector diagnostic capabilities, evaluate the use of vector diagnostics in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and discuss the concept of operations under which vector diagnostics are employed."

The WHO has issued recommendations, but the selection of the most suitable RDT remains difficult for users in endemic countries. The genetic variability of the antigens detected with RDTs has been little studied, but may affect the sensitivity of RDTs.

CD008122,0,18510724,0,Access to artemisinin combination therapy for malaria in remote areas of Cambodia.,"Malaria-endemic countries are switching antimalarial drug policy to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) and the global community are considering the setting up of a global subsidy mechanism in order to make them accessible and affordable. However, specific interventions may be needed to reach remote at-risk communities and to ensure that they are used appropriately. This analysis documents the coverage with ACTs versus artemisinin monotherapies, and the effectiveness of malaria outreach teams (MOTs) and Village Malaria Workers (VMWs) in increasing access to appropriate diagnosis and treatment with ACTs in Cambodia, the first country to switch national antimalarial drug policy to an ACT of artesunate and mefloquine (A+M) in 2000."
CD008122,0,8376875,0,"Visceral leishmaniasis among hypersplenic patients in Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt.","Generally speaking, with rapid international travel, it is very common to diagnose infectious diseases in areas where they were not known before. Nowadays, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is documented in Egypt mainly in Al Agamy, Alexandria. Another case of infantile visceral leishmaniasis was identified in an adult farmer (unusual host) in Banha. Other studies all over Egypt (based on clinical and or serological diagnosis rather than demonstration of the parasites) raised the possibility of adult affection with visceral leishmaniasis. The point is that visceral leishmaniasis, shares many clinical manifestations with other diseases known in Egypt as schistosomiasis mansoni, hepatic amoebiasis, toxoplasmosis, and malaria. In the present study, out of 22 human cases with hypersplenism and suggesting manifestations, four gave seropositivity for VL, by the indirect haemagglutination tests (128 & more). Two of these four patients gave seropositivity by dot-ELISA (1:8000). Amastigotes of Leishmania parasite were demonstrated in the splenic smears obtained during splenectomy. One culture obtained from these two cases grew promastigotes. Typing is ongoing. It was concluded that visceral leishmaniasis should be in mind and considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with hepatosplenomegaly or hypersplenism in Egypt."
CD008122,0,12201580,0,Clinical and laboratory predictors of imported malaria in an outpatient setting: an aid to medical decision making in returning travelers with fever.,"No evidence-based information exists to guide clinicians for giving presumptive treatment to returning travelers when malaria is strongly suspected on clinical grounds but laboratory confirmation is not immediately available or is negative. A prospective study was conducted in travelers or migrants who sought care for fever to identify clinical and laboratory predictors of Plasmodium parasitemia. A total of 336 questionnaires were collected (97 malaria case patients and 239 controls). Multivariate regression analysis showed inadequate prophylaxis, sweating, no abdominal pain, temperature > or = 38 degrees C, poor general health, enlarged spleen, leucocytes < or = 10 x 10(3)/L, platelets < 150 x 10(3)/L, hemoglobin < 12 g/dL, and eosinophils < or = 5% to be associated with parasitemia. Enlarged spleen had the highest positive likelihood ratio for a diagnosis of malaria (13.6), followed by thrombopenia (11.0). Posttest probabilities for malaria were 85% with enlarged spleen and 82% with thrombopenia. A rapid assessment can thus help to decide whether a presumptive treatment should be given or not, especially when the results of the parasitological examination are not immediately available or are uncertain."

CD008122,0,10548307,0,Interethnic differences in the humoral response to non-repetitive regions of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein.,"We analyzed the humoral immune response to the amino- (amino acids 22-125) and carboxy-terminal (amino acids 289-390) non-repetitive domains of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) in individuals belonging to three west African ethnic groups (the Fulani, Mossi, and Rimaibé) living in the same conditions of hyperendemic transmission in a Sudan savanna area of Burkina Faso. Previous surveys conducted in the same area showed obvious interethnic differences in the susceptibility and immune reactivity to malaria, with the Fulani showing lower infection and disease rates and higher humoral responses to various P. falciparum antigens than sympatric ethnic groups. A total of 764 subjects (311 Mossi, 273 Rimaibé, and 180 Fulani) of all age classes were tested. The total mean +/- SE anti-(CSPf-N-term) and anti-(CSPf-C-term) seroprevalences were 65.6 +/- 1.7% and 57.0 +/- 1.8%, respectively. These seroprevalences were lower than that recorded in the same sample for the central (NANP)40 repetitive domain (88.3 +/- 1.2%). As previously reported for other P. falciparum antigens (PfCSP-(NANP)40, thrombospondin-related anonymous protein, merozoite surface protein-1, Pf155-ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen, and Pf332), in spite of similar exposure to malaria, the Fulani showed higher immune reactivity than sympatric populations for both antigens tested. Our results confirm the presence of B cell epitopes in the non-repetitive regions of the PfCSP; moreover a further evidence of interethnic differences in the capacity to mount humoral responses against P. falciparum malaria was obtained. The assessment of the biological basis of interethnic heterogeneities in the susceptibility and in the humoral immune responses to malaria appears relevant in the development of anti-malaria vaccines."

Fortunately, nature also provides the wherewithal to help conquer the diseases that it sets loose. All that is needed is the human ingenuity to discover, develop and apply the solutions in an optimal fashion. Participants at the 9th Max Tishler Memorial Symposium (Tokyo, July 2005) were told about several new advances in the search for new anti-infective drugs derived from natural sources and were able to learn how one of the most effective drugs ever, ivermectin, made its way through what was, at the time, uncharted territory and how precedents were set at nearly every stage to form a model for all subsequent public-private partnerships."
CD008122,0,12530504,0,Feasibility and limitations of acridine orange fluorescence technique using a Malaria Diagnosis Microscope in Myanmar.,"We studied parasite detectability in thick films by an acridine orange fluorescence technique (AO) to test its applicability and the use of a Malaria Diagnosis Microscope (MDM)-ESL in the detection of parasites, compared to the conventional Giemsa staining method. This study was conducted on 1,390 clinically suspected malaria cases of Thaton township, Myanmar. We found sensitivities of 82.8% for Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) and 100% for Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and specificities of 97.1% for P. falciparum and 98.6% for P. vivax. AO had a higher sensitivity than Giemsa-stained films at low levels of parasitemia (< 1,000/microl). AO showed lower sensitivity and higher specificity than the Giemsa method at parasite levels of more than 1,000/microl. The results of using the AO method, achieved by both novice and experienced observers, showed no significant difference and required less practice to perform the test as well as to identify the parasite. The acridine orange fluorescence technique using a malaria diagnosis microscope MDM-ESL series is simple, rapid and cost effective. The microscope is conveniently operable using standard AC power or a 12-V DC car battery, and it is easily convertible to a conventional biological microscope. With the exception of species differentiation, which is not possible with this method, this method would be appropriate for both clinical and epidemiological studies."
CD008122,0,11280052,0,Evaluation under field conditions of the colourimetric DELI-microtest for the assessment of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance.,"It has been frequently stressed that improved methods are needed to monitor the fast spread of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites in endemic areas. We recently developed a colourimetric microtest, double-site enzyme-linked lactate dehydrogenase enzyme immunodetection assay (DELI), to assess drug resistance in vitro. This method, which proved highly effective under laboratory conditions, was evaluated under field conditions in 2 African areas (in Senegal and Burkina Faso) in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The sensitivities of isolates from symptomatic (n = 50) and asymptomatic individuals (n = 26) infected with P. falciparum were assessed in parallel by the new DELI-microtest and the isotopic-microtest. IC50 values of the isolates determined for chloroquine, quinine, amodiaquine and mefloquine were well correlated (r = 0.79, P < 0.001). The proportions of sensitive and resistant isolates determined using the 2 methods were similar. The DELI-microtest proved to be faster to implement than the isotopic-microtest, easier to perform, and did not require sophisticated equipment. Moreover, a larger number of isolates can be tested since parasitaemias as low as 0.005% could be reliably measured with the DELI-microtest. These initial field studies thus support the value of the DELI-microtest for large-scale drug-sensitivity monitoring."
CD008122,0,11280051,0,Associations of peak shifts in age--prevalence for human malarias with bednet coverage.,"Effects of bednet coverage (C) on prevalence of malaria were analysed using data from 1990-92 from 9 Papua New Guinean villages. Effects of coverage varied by age, resulting in a shift in age of peak prevalence from 4.7 (C = 0%) to 11.6 (C = 100%) years for Plasmodium falciparum, from 3.4 to 4.9 years for P. vivax and from 11.0 to 16.8 years for P. malariae. In small areas with no bednets the age distribution of P. falciparum parasitaemia was like that of a holoendemic area. Where coverage was complete the pattern corresponded to mesoendemicity. Thus, protracted use of bednets can result in profound changes in the endemicity of malaria even when coverage is incomplete and without insecticide treatment. Average entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) estimated from indoor landing rates on individuals without bednets were 35, 12 and 10 infectious bites per person per annum for P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae, respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the EIR estimate for P. falciparum was related to prevalence of this species independently of effects of bednet coverage. However, the recent EIR still accounted for much less variation than did the bednets. A similar pattern was seen for P. malariae, while there were no significant relationships between the recent EIR and the parasite positivity for P. vivax. It is concluded that short-term variations in inoculation rate are not important determinants of parasite prevalence in this population."
CD008122,0,1812785,0,"An original method for rapid serial determination of phospholipid biosynthesis. Applications to mammalian lymphocytic cells and a lower eucaryote, Plasmodium falciparum.","A rapid, convenient, and efficient method is presented to measure phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis from [3H]choline, [3H]ethanolamine, and [3H]inositol, respectively. After incubation of the cells in 96-multi-well dishes with the appropriate radioactive precursor, cells were lysed with water and the water-insoluble materials, particularly cellular membranes which contain the bulk of phospholipids, were serially collected on glass-fiber papers using a cell harvester. The method was first applied to human lymphocytic cell lines then adapted to Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes which in both cases allowed recovery of more than 90% of the newly biosynthesized phospholipids. With this quick method, adapted to short incubation periods (less than 5 h), we were able to determine optimal conditions such as the best medium (RPMI devoid of serum, thus avoiding interference from endogenous precursors, notably choline present in significant quantities in serum) and the lowest specific activity to be used for each radioactive precursor and the minimum quantity of cells. This method could be adapted to other cell systems, provided that the precursors are specific to phospholipids and that the bulk of biosynthesized phospholipids are present as membrane components. Finally, by this method the activity of effectors of phospholipid metabolism can be tested on a large scale, thus allowing rapid screening of original molecules specifically affecting cellular phospholipid metabolism."
CD008122,0,11280055,0,Malaria in the highlands of Madagascar after five years of indoor house spraying of DDT.,"The central region of Madagascar is a vast area of highlands (altitude 700-2000 m). Malaria transmission has re-established itself here since the last epidemic of 1985-90 and has caused the deaths of 40,000 persons according to the Minister of Health. To combat the main malaria vector in the region, Anopheles funestus, annual programmes of indoor house spraying of DDT were carried out between December 1993 and January 1998 in most rural areas at altitude 1000-1500 m. A parasitological and serological study was then conducted in the highland schools to evaluate the impact of the programme and set up a database on the region. Using a cluster-sampling method 2 independent selections were conducted (one of 130 sites, the other of 40 sites). During the study, 13,462 schoolchildren were examined, 71% living in sprayed villages. Parasite prevalence among schoolchildren declined as altitude increases, from 11% at 700-900 m to 0.4% at > 1500 m. Below 1500 m, the impact of the spraying on the prevalence of the parasite was very clear (an average decrease of from 20% to 2.7% below 1000 m and of from 4.5% without spraying to 0.8% at 1000-1500 m). Geographical analysis of the data showed that the marginal regions remained the most affected by malaria (especially outside spraying zones), and persistence of 'pockets of transmission' at 1000-1500 m, essentially in areas where spraying has never been used. In 9 schools, anti-Plasmodium antibodies were sought by indirect immunofluorescence on thick smears of parasitized red blood cells. The seroprevalence ranged from 22% to 63%, which suggests that the parasite is still circulating in the region. Even though our data show that vector control continues to be very successful in the Madagascan highlands, rapid reinfection could occur and must be monitored following spraying. To this end, the Minister for Health, with the support of the Italian Co-operation, has placed the region under epidemiological surveillance since 1997. An alert system for the timely detection of the sources of epidemics and the targeting of the antivectoral campaign is also in operation. Our study suggests that this strategy should be reinforced by the spraying of DDT in the marginal zones in order to consolidate the results obtained at higher altitudes."
CD008122,0,9986839,1,Sensitivity and specificity of dipstick tests for rapid diagnosis of malaria in nonimmune travelers.,"Swift diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in areas where the disease is not endemic is frequently complicated by the lack of experience on the side of involved laboratory personal. Diagnostic tools based on the dipstick principle for the detection of plasmodial histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2) and parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), respectively, have become available for the qualitative detection of P. falciparum malaria. In order to evaluate two of the currently available assays, specimens from 231 patients were screened during a prospective multicenter study. Among the screened specimens, samples from 53 patients (22.9%) were positive for P. falciparum malaria by microscopy and/or PCR. While the test kit based on the detection of HRP-2 performed with a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 98.3%, the kit for the detection of pLDH showed a sensitivity of 88.5% and a specificity of 99.4%. Dipstick tests have the potential of enhancing speed and accuracy of the diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria, especially if nonspecialized laboratories are involved."

In 2006 and 2007, we obtained blood smears for rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and filter paper blots of blood from 821 persons by passive and active case detection. P. falciparum infections diagnosed for 79 persons by blood smear or RDT were confirmed by PCR for the small subunit rRNA gene of P. falciparum. Amplification of the P. falciparum CQ resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene yielded 10 samples with amplicons resistant to cleavage by ApoI. A total of 5 of 9 samples had threonine at position 76 of pfcrt, which is consistent with CQ resistance (haplotypes at positions 72-76 were CVIET [n = 4] and CVMNT [n = 1]); 4 had only the wild-type haplotype associated with CQ susceptibility (CVMNK). These results indicate that CQ-resistant haplotype P. falciparum malaria parasites are present in Haiti."
CD008122,0,10678927,0,Metalloprotease activity in a small heat shock protein of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax.,"The malaria parasite affects millions of people each year, lives and multiplies in two different hosts, and synthesizes a large number of proteases and heat shock proteins (HSPs) for its survival. We describe here the characterization of a metalloprotease activity which resides in the small HSP (PVHSP28) of the common but noncultivable human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. The protein is expressed by erythrocytic stages of the parasite. It is expressed as a approximately 55-kDa polypeptide which is then processed to the 28-kDa mature protein. The latter was found to be an active protease in gelatin zymography. This protease showed its optimal activity at 37 degrees C (pH 7.6). It also retained its proteolytic activity at higher temperatures of up to 55 degrees C. The enzyme belongs to the metalloprotease class, as its proteolytic activity was most effectively blocked by 1,10-phenanthroline and was restored to a maximal level by the addition of zinc metal ions. Inhibitors for the cysteine, serine, and aspartate classes of proteases were ineffective against this enzyme. A homology search indicates that PVHSP28 probably belongs to a new class of HSPs which possess the metalloprotease signature sequence."
CD008122,0,3538370,0,Plasma lactoferrin content: differential effect of steroid administration and infective illnesses: lack of effect of ambient temperature at which specimens are collected.,"The effect of parenteral hydrocortisone on plasma lactoferrin concentration, neutrophil count and lactoferrin:neutrophil ratio was assessed in 10 volunteer subjects. Administration of a single dose of corticosteroid was followed by a significant rise in the circulating neutrophil count, a significant but proportionately smaller rise in the plasma lactoferrin concentration and a significant fall in the lactoferrin:neutrophil ratio. Acute viral infections were found to be associated with a disproportionately low plasma lactoferrin concentration relative to the circulating neutrophil count. The relatively low lactoferrin concentrations in both these situations could be of significance in regard to the propensity to bacterial infection and superinfection which these 2 groups of subjects display. Compared to patients with viral infection, those suffering from Plasmodium falciparum malaria showed a significantly elevated lactoferrin:neutrophil ratio, although this ratio was not significantly different when malarial patients were compared to normal individuals. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of relative neutropenia in viral and protozoal illnesses is fundamentally different. Finally, it was found that the temperature at which specimen collection takes place does not appear to be a significant variable determining the plasma lactoferrin concentration."

The cloned gene fragment encodes GLURP,489-1271 the carboxy-terminal 783 amino acid residue portion of a 1271 amino acid residue P. falciparum glutamate rich protein (GLURP), with a molecular weight of 220 kilodalton. The protein is associated with all parasite stages in the human host. Examination of sera from 105 adult Liberians living in a malaria endemic area revealed anti-GLURP IgG antibodies in 98% of the sera. The recombinant GLURP489-1271 was expressed as a chimeric protein, fused with E. coli beta-galactosidase. However, antibodies in sera were directed only against the malaria part of the fusion protein and not against beta-galactosidase. Antigen from in vitro P. falciparum cultures of isolates from Tanzania (F32), Papua New Guinea (MAD20) and Honduras (HB3) completely absorbed specific antibodies, indicating the presence of conserved epitopes produced by all isolates of P. falciparum. Recombinant GLURP489-1271 ELISA is sensitive and rapid, and therefore well-suited for sero-epidemiological studies, and for control of the immunogenicity of a possible future P. falciparum vaccine utilizing epitopes from GLURP."
CD008122,0,8475036,0,Circulating stable antigens at higher levels down-regulate antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum.,"A study involving 169 schoolchildren (5-14 years old) living in Manarintsoa near Antananarivo (Madagascar, East Africa) was performed during the seasonal malaria transmission period. For the whole population examined, the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and the rates of spleen enlargement and of circulating stable antigen (S-Ag) were found to be 60.9%, 71.7%, and 46.8%, respectively. The prevalence of IgG antibody to RESA (ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen) was 42.7% and that of IgG and IgM antibodies to E-Ag (exoantigens) was 44.9% and 2.9%, respectively. The positive rates for IgG and IgM antibodies to Som-Ag (somatic antigen) were 48.5% and 5.9%, respectively. Concerning S-Ag, no significant relationship was observed for parasitemia, spleen size, age, or IgM antibody responses to exoantigens (E-Ag) or to somatic antigen (Som-Ag). Levels of S-Ag were found to be related to IgG antibodies to E-Ag. Our results suggest that S-Ag at low levels may participate in the mechanisms involved in the development of the IgG antibody responses to E-Ag and to Som-Ag, whereas at a comparative population level, higher quantities of S-Ag down-regulate antibody responses to P. falciparum. The data we obtained were compared with those gathered in another malaria mesoendemic area (Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, West Africa), where lower levels of S-Ag were found."

Little is known about obstacles to treatment and community-effectiveness of case-management strategies.

CD008122,0,15137318,0,[Current situation of the malaria inspection in Jikei University Hospital].,"The current situation of the malaria inspection in our laboratory was investigated. Malaria was detected by three different methods, May Giemsa staining(MG), acridine orange staining(AO), and antigen detecting method using NOW ICT Malaria P.f./P.v. kit(Ag). There were 207 requests a year(17.3 per month), and the holiday/night request occupied 12%. Fifteen patients were positive, 5 with plasmodium falciparum (p.f.) and 10 with plasmodium vivax(p.v.), including 3 relapsed cases. All the patients with p.f. were suffered in Africa, and 6 with p.v. were in Southeast Asia, and one with p.v. was in Central America. The rate of coincidence between MG/Ag and MG/AO were 94.4% and 96.9%, respectively. There were 7 samples that were MG negative and Ag positive, but all of these samples were obtained after the initiation of the treatment. There was no sample that showed MG positive and Ag negative. Our data suggested that no difference in detection sensitivity was found between microscopic observation and the antigen detection kit. Thus it would be a very useful and accurate strategy to use this antigen detection kit in a routine laboratory check up."
CD008122,0,18302186,0,Monitoring Plasmodium falciparum growth and development by UV flow cytometry using an optimized Hoechst-thiazole orange staining strategy.,"The complex life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) makes it difficult to limit infections and reduce the risk of severe malaria. Improved understanding of Pf blood-stage growth and development would provide new opportunities to evaluate and interfere with successful completion of the parasite's life cycle. Cultured blood stage Pf was incubated with Hoechst 33342 (HO) and thiazole orange (TO) to stain DNA and total nucleic acids, respectively. Correlated HO and TO fluorescence emissions were then measured by flow cytometry. Complex bivariate data patterns were analyzed by manual cluster gating to quantify parasite life cycle stages. The permutations of viable staining with both reagents were tested for optimal detection of parasitized RBC (pRBC). Pf cultures were exposed to HO and TO simultaneously to achieve optimal staining of pRBC and consistent quantification of early and late stages of the replicative cycle (rings through schizonts). Staining of Pf nucleic acids allows for analysis of parasite development in the absence of fixatives, lysis, or radioactivity to enable examination of erythrocytes from parasite invasion through schizont rupture using sensitive and rapid assay procedures. Investigation of the mechanisms by which anti-malarial drugs and antibodies act against different Pf lifecycle stages will be aided by this cytometric strategy."
CD008122,0,15121316,0,Immunogenicity of Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein-9 recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli.,"Merozoite surface protein-9 of Plasmodium vivax (PvMSP-9) is highly conserved and present in several malaria species. Here, we present the immunogenic properties of two recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins comprising the N-terminus (PvMSP-9-Nt) and the second block of tandem repeats (PvMSP-9-RepII) of PvMSP9. These recombinants proteins were used to immunize BALB/c mice. The specificity and subtyping of the antibodies and the cellular immune responses were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ELISPOT, respectively, using the recombinant proteins as antigens. Our results demonstrate that both the N-terminal and the tandem repeat regions of MSP9 are immunogenic in mice. The ELISA antibody titers elicited by PvMSP-9-Nt were significantly higher (1:819,200) than the antibody titers elicited by PvMSP-9-RII (1:409,600). Analysis of IgG subclasses showed that both recombinant proteins induce similar antibody patterns where IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b were most predominant. Moreover, all sera from mice immunized with either PvMSP-9-Nt or PvMSP-9-RII, which were positive by ELISA showed reactivity with P. vivax, P. cynomolgi, P. knowlesi and P. coatneyi schizonts by immunofluorescence assays (IFA). Similar results were observed in western immunoblot analyses using parasite extracts. Furthermore, immunization of mice with the PvMSP-9-Nt upon stimulation with PvMSP-9-Nt secreted IFN-gamma and IL-5. We have also used the two PvMSP-9 recombinant constructs to show that individuals exposed to P. vivax infections in an endemic area of Brazil had IgG antibodies reactive with the recombinant proteins."

All consecutive subjects aged >5 years who presented with a history of fever were recruited. Each was checked for P. vivax infection by the standard microscopical examination of bloodsmears and by the immunochromatographic test (ICT). The costs of diagnosis using each method and the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the ICT (with bloodsmear examination used as the 'gold standard') were estimated, the costs/case detected being simulated for different slide positivity 'rates' and ICT sensitivities. In the detection of P. vivax, the ICT had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 99%. The costs of the ICT per subject investigated and per case detected were, respectively, approximately 14 and 20 times more than those of bloodsmear examination. The costs of the ICT per case detected would fall as the sensitivity of the test increased. The ICT gave relatively few false-positive results. The current, relatively high cost of the ICT is the most important barrier to its routine operational use in the diagnosis of malaria. The test is already useful, however, in specific situations."

We optimized a direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to simultaneously determine the total antibody levels, including IgG and IgM, to PvMSP1c. If the cut-off for seropositivity was determined as the mean+3SD of the antibody levels of the negative control group, the antibody levels were positive in 99.5% of the patient group (sensitivity 199/200). The antibody levels were negative in 99.4% of the negative control group (specificity 504/507). The positive reactions in the negative control group came from non-specific reactions, as confirmed by a competition assay. This direct sandwich ELISA for PvMSP1c antibody could prove to be a useful tool for the diagnosis of malaria patients and for blood screening in blood banks."
CD008122,0,10715689,0,Malaria in pregnancy: its relevance to safe-motherhood programmes.,"Severe anaemia in pregnancy is an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. In sub-Saharan Africa severe anaemia in pregnancy is very common, the main causes being iron and folate deficiency, malaria, hookworm infestation and advanced HIV infection. Though most of these causes are preventable, the overall prevalence of anaemia has not changed over many years. This is probably due to a mixture of reasons, including operational problems and inadequate interventions. In addition, a true effect on severe anaemia may have been missed if the only measure taken is of the overall prevalence of anaemia. One cause of anaemia that has been neglected by safe-motherhood programmes has been malaria in pregnancy. In endemic areas, malaria in pregnancy is usually asymptomatic and often associated with a negative peripheral-blood film. Hence the condition needs to be treated and prevented as a matter of routine in all women at risk of infection. A trial conducted in Kenya demonstrated that intermittent treatment with the antimalarial sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), given a couple of times during pregnancy when women attend for antenatal care, can reduce severe anaemia in primigravidae by 39%. The results of this study demonstrate the important contribution of malaria to severe anaemia in pregnancy in areas of endemic transmission. Intermittent treatment with SP in pregnancy has also been shown to be effective in improving birthweight. Though questions remain about the optimal way to deliver this intervention to different groups of women, we cannot afford to wait for all of the answers. The degree to which malaria contributes to severe anaemia in pregnancy is now clear. In Kenya intermittent SP is now policy for pregnant women from malarious areas. The challenge now is for this regimen to be successfully implemented as part of an integrated programme of anaemia control in pregnancy."

These two methods, each with characteristic strengths and limitations, together represent the best hope for accurate diagnosis as a key component of successful malaria control. This review addresses the quality issues with current malaria diagnostics and presents data from recent rapid diagnostic test trials. Reduction of malaria morbidity and drug resistance intensity plus the associated economic loss of these two factors require urgent scaling up of the quality of parasite-based diagnostic methods. An investment in anti-malarial drug development or malaria vaccine development should be accompanied by a parallel commitment to improve diagnostic tools and their availability to people living in malarious areas."

Ophthalmologic examination consisted of indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy under medicamentous mydriasis, biomicroscopy with a portable slit lamp and measurement of central visual acuity. Vitamin A serum concentration was determined by HPLC, and deficiency was defined as serum values equal to or lower than 0.35 micromol/l. Serum vitamin A values between 0.36 and 0.70 micromol/l were considered as marginal levels. Hypovitaminosis A (</=0.70 micromol/l serum levels) was observed in 33% (66/200) of the patients. Ocular lesions were associated with serum levels </=0.35 micromol/l (P < 0.001).

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in comparison to microscopy in guiding treatment of non-severe febrile illness at varying levels of malaria endemicity using data on test accuracy and costs collected as part of a Tanzanian trial. If prescribers complied with current guidelines, microscopy would give rise to lower average costs per patient correctly treated than RDTs in areas of both high and low transmission. RDT introduction would result in an additional 2.3% and 9.4% of patients correctly treated, at an incremental cost of $25 and $7 in the low and high transmission settings, respectively. Cost-effectiveness would be worse if prescribers do not comply with test results. The cost of this additional benefit may be higher than many countries can afford without external assistance or lower RDT prices."

Ranking of the strains in term of sensitivity for the detection of malaria antibody in people in the endemic area were G-112 = SO = CC greater than SU greater than PS in the IHA test and G-112 = SO greater than CC greater than SU greater than PS in the ELISA. The difference in the mean log titers appear to relate neither to the geographical location not the isoenzyme markers tested. There was also an apparent correlation between the results of the IHA and the IFA test but not between these two tests and ELISA."

Because T-cell-dependent antigens, typically proteins, both produce boosted antibody levels and promote antibody class switching, it has been considered highly desirable to attempt to convert the T-cell-independent polysaccharide antigens into T-cell-dependent antigens, particularly for use in high-risk groups. A number of clinical trials now report the efficacy of conjugate vaccines in inducing the production of antibody in response to a number of previously poorly immunogenic--mainly T-cell-independent--antigens. In addition to conjugate vaccines containing bacterial polysaccharides, vaccines containing relevant peptides from a variety of pathogens are also being formulated and investigated. Questions remain, however, regarding their synthesis, use, and efficacy. The best ages for vaccine administration and selection of the optimal protein carrier are still under investigation, as are questions regarding the use of adjuvants, which can greatly affect the vaccine's potency. Spacing and size of epitope and size and composition of the final structure also must be considered; the importance of molecular size and aggregation of antigen in increasing immunogenicity have been well documented. These questions must be addressed for the much-needed development of conjugate vaccines against some common infections worldwide, including malaria, bacterial meningitis, and infections from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoeae because of increasing susceptibility to these infections and resistance of the pathogens to chemotherapeutic agents and/or antibiotics."

The individual species showed a different distribution pattern in the 3 study areas. In Tchad we found the lowest number of mosquitoes and also the fewest Anopheles, but when we investigated the number of Plasmodium falciparum-infected Anopheles sp. we observed the highest entomological inoculation rate (EIR) there. The EIRs were 23 in HAS, 53 in Bellevue and 61 in Tchad.

CD008122,0,11952944,0,Malaria prevention in highland Kenya: indoor residual house-spraying vs. insecticide-treated bednets.,"This study compares the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of indoor residual house-spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) against infection with Plasmodium falciparum as part of malaria control in the highlands of western Kenya. Homesteads operationally targeted for IRS and ITNs during a district-based emergency response undertaken by an international relief agency were selected at random for evaluation. Five hundred and ninety homesteads were selected (200 with no vector control, 200 with IRS and 190 with ITNs). In July 2000, residents in these homesteads were randomly sampled according to three age-groups: 6 months-4 years, 5-15 years, and > 15 years for the presence of P. falciparum antigen (Pf HRP-2) using the rapid whole blood immunochromatographic test (ICT). The prevalence of P. falciparum infection amongst household members not protected by either IRS or ITN was 13%. Sleeping under a treated bednet reduced the risk of infection by 63% (58-68%) and sleeping in a room sprayed with insecticide reduced the risk by 75% (73-76%). The economic cost per infection case prevented by IRS was US$ 9 compared to US$ 29 for ITNs. This study suggests that IRS may be both more effective and cheaper than ITNs in communities subjected to low, seasonal risks of infection and as such should be considered as part of the control armamentarium for malaria prevention."

The investigation was carried out on skin, muscle and bone samples. We examined predynastic egyptian mummies (3200 B.C.) from Gebelen, belonging to the Marro's Collection of the Anthropological and Ethnographic Museum of Turin, to assay the presence of malaria. The results obtained suggest an incidence of malaria of about 40% in the mummies of Gebelen group.

CD008122,0,18345458,0,Evaluation of a malaria antibody enzyme immunoassay for use in blood screening.,"Transfusion-transmitted malaria is rare, but it may produce severe problem in the safety of blood transfusion due to the lack of reliable procedure to evaluate donors potentially exposed to malaria. Here, we evaluated a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay malaria antibody test (ELISA malaria antibody test, DiaMed, Switzerland) to detect antibodies to Plasmodium vivax (the indigenous malaria) in the blood samples in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Blood samples of four groups were obtained and analyzed; 100 samples from P.vivax infected patients, 35 from recovery patients, 366 from normal healthy individuals, and 325 from domestic travelers of non-endemic areas residents to risky areas of ROK. P.vivax antibody levels by ELISA were then compared to the results from microscopic examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. As a result, the ELISA malaria antibody test had a clinical sensitivity of 53.0% and a clinical specificity of 94.0% for P.vivax. Twenty out of 325 domestic travelers (6.2%) were reactive and 28 cases (8.6%) were doubtful. Of the reactive and doubtful cases, only two were confirmed as acute malaria by both microscopy and PCR test. Thus we found that the ELISA malaria antibody test was insufficiently sensitive for blood screening of P.vivax in ROK."
CD008122,0,17907804,0,Structure of the malaria antigen AMA1 in complex with a growth-inhibitory antibody.,"Identifying functionally critical regions of the malaria antigen AMA1 (apical membrane antigen 1) is necessary to understand the significance of the polymorphisms within this antigen for vaccine development. The crystal structure of AMA1 in complex with the Fab fragment of inhibitory monoclonal antibody 1F9 reveals that 1F9 binds to the AMA1 solvent-exposed hydrophobic trough, confirming its importance. 1F9 uses the heavy and light chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to wrap around the polymorphic loops adjacent to the trough, but uses a ridge of framework residues to bind to the hydrophobic trough. The resulting 1F9-AMA1-combined buried surface of 2,470 A(2) is considerably larger than previously reported Fab-antigen interfaces. Mutations of polymorphic AMA1 residues within the 1F9 epitope disrupt 1F9 binding and dramatically reduce the binding of affinity-purified human antibodies. Moreover, 1F9 binding to AMA1 is competed by naturally acquired human antibodies, confirming that the 1F9 epitope is a frequent target of immunological attack."
CD008122,0,11425154,0,CR1 density polymorphism on erythrocytes of falciparum malaria patients in Thailand.,"Complement receptor type 1 (CR1) on erythrocytes shows an inherited numerical polymorphism which correlates with a HindIII-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) of the CR1 gene in various populations. To investigate the relationship between CR1 density polymorphism and disease severity, we typed 185 Thai patients with acute falciparum malaria (55 severe and 130 uncomplicated) for their genotypes of this polymorphism. The level of expression of erythrocyte CR1 from 42 randomly selected patients was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We observed a significantly higher frequency of homozygotes of the CR1 low density allele (LL) among the severe group as compared to the uncomplicated group (P = 0.005). CR1 expression on erythrocytes from patients with the LL genotype was significantly lower than homozygotes with the high density allele (HH) (P < 0.0001) and heterozygotes (HL) (P = 0.013). The results suggest that a genetically-determined low CR1 density on erythrocytes may be a risk factor for developing a more severe form of malaria in Thai subjects."
CD008122,0,11425156,1,Diagnosis of imported malaria by Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2)-based immunocapture assays.,"This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of two rapid non-microscopic assays: Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) assay (OptiMAL) and Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2) assay (ICT Malaria). The assays were used to detect malaria infection in 515 immigrants living in Kuwait. The performance of both assays was compared to that of microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick blood films and to each other. Of the 515 patients tested, 163 were positive for malaria parasites by microscopy of thick blood film. Of these, 87 were infected with Plasmodium vivax parasites, 63 with P. falciparum, 1 with Plasmodium malariae, and 12 had mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax. The PfHRP-2 assay detected 53 P. falciparum infections and, as expected, failed to detect all but one case of P. vivax. Three cases of mixed infections were also not detected by this assay. The pLDH assay detected 56 P. falciparum cases and 77 P. vivax infections but failed to detect 4 cases of mixed infections. Compared to microscopy, the performance of both the assays to diagnose P. falciparum infection was comparable. The sensitivity for the PfHRP-2 assay was 82% with a specificity of 99.0% and for the pLDH assay the sensitivity was 89% with a specificity of 99.5%. The PfHRP-2 assay detected 4 false positive cases, 2 of which were also detected by the pLDH assay. These patients reported treatment with chloroquine in the last 2-5 weeks. Though the immunocapture diagnostic assays may be helpful in certain situations, microscopy of thick blood film is still the method of choice in diagnosing imported malaria."

We have conducted a Phase I trial with three doses of this vaccine given at 0, 1, and 6 months to 20 semi-immune, adult, male volunteers in The Gambia to assess its safety and immunogenicity. Eighteen of the 20 volunteers completed the study. There were no clinically significant local or systemic adverse events following each vaccination. Hematologic and biochemical indices before and two weeks after each vaccination showed no evidence of toxicity. Antibody titers to both CSP and HBs showed a significant increase after vaccination; these were the largest after the third dose. We conclude that the RTS,S/SBAS2 vaccine induces no significant toxicity in this semi-immune population and produces significant increases in antibody titers to CSP."

CD008122,0,17524244,0,"Ability of mothers to diagnose fever and anaemia in their young children, in a malaria-endemic region of West Africa.","The rapid and correct diagnosis of fever and anaemia at the household level is a prerequisite for the successful management and control of life-threatening disease among young children, particularly in malaria-endemic areas of Africa. The ability of mothers to diagnose fever and anaemia in their young children has recently been explored, as part of a large, birth-cohort study in rural, north-western Burkina Faso. During a cross-sectional survey in six villages, 345 children aged, <3 years and their mothers were investigated. Each mother was asked if she considered her child to be febrile and/or anaemic before that child's temperature and haematocrit were measured, with an electronic thermometer and portable centrifuge, respectively. The recorded prevalences of fever (> or =37.5 degrees C) and anaemia (haematocrit, <25%) in the children were 12.2% and 21.4%, respectively. The mothers' diagnoses had a sensitivity of 76.2% [95% confidence interval (CI)=60.6%-88.0%] for fever and 4.1% (CI=0.8%-11.4%) for anaemia, with corresponding specificities of 87.1% (CI=82.8%-90.7%) and 95.9% (CI=92.9%-98.0%). Mothers in rural Africa appear to be fairly accurate in detecting fever in their children but less accurate in detecting anaemia. While malaria control needs to employ a mix of preventive and curative measures, anaemia control will benefit from community-based malaria-control measures as well as broader approaches addressing the nutritional status of young children."
CD008122,0,2204363,0,Cell-mediated immune responses to soluble Plasmodium falciparum antigens in residents from an area of unstable malaria transmission in the Sudan.,"This paper describes immune responses to P. falciparum infection in individuals living in an area of highly seasonal, unstable malaria transmission. The in vitro cellular immune responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 36 Sudanese donors to a complex of affinity purified soluble P. falciparum antigens (SPag) and two components thereof (Ag1 and Ag7) were examined and compared to humoral immune parameters. In 29/36 Sudanese donors, SPag induced a significant lymphoproliferative response in vitro. In contrast only 3/27 Danish donors never exposed to malaria responded to SPag. Ag1 and Ag7 induced significant lymphoproliferation in 9/34 and 13/36 Sudanese donors respectively, whereas no Danish donors responded. Significant interferon-gamma production was observed in 16/27, 1/5 and 3/12 Sudanese donors when stimulated by SPag, Ag1 and Ag7 respectively. Lymphoproliferative responses to SPag correlated with proliferative responses to Ag1 and Ag7, and with Spag-induced interferon-gamma production. These results indicate that T-cell clones recognizing epitopes on Ag1 and Ag7 have been expanded in the studied population as a result of exposure to P. falciparum infection. The T-cell parameters did not correlate with the presence of antibodies to SPag, Pf155/RESA or a crude parasite sonicate or with the schizont IFA titers of the plasma. This indicates that parameters outside the degree of exposure to P. falciparum influence the cellular immune responses to malaria."
CD008122,0,17360871,1,Which malaria rapid test for Madagascar? Field and laboratory evaluation of three tests and expert microscopy of samples from suspected malaria patients in Madagascar.,"Field and laboratory studies were carried out in October and November 2005 to provide a comparative evaluation of the performance of three rapid malaria detection tests, two of which were recently introduced (the CareStart Malaria test and the SD Malaria Antigen Bioline test) and the well-known OptiMAL-IT test. Compared with microscopy, the sensitivity of the three tests to detect Plasmodium falciparum malaria was 97% for the CareStart Malaria test, 89.4% for the SD Malaria Antigen Bioline test, and 92.6% for the OptiMAL-IT test. The three tests were less sensitive in detecting non-P. falciparum infections, and the sensitivity decreased at levels of parasitemia<or=500 parasites/microL for P. falciparum and<or=5,000 parasites/microL for other Plasmodium spp. On the basis of World Health Organization recommendations, only the CareStart Malaria test and the OptiMAL-IT test had sensitivities greater than 95% for samples with parasitemias>or=100 parasites/microL."
CD008122,0,14605156,1,Multicenter study to evaluate the OptiMAL test for rapid diagnosis of malaria in U.S. hospitals.,"More than 1,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed each year in the United States. Reported numbers, however, may be artificially low because many clinicians fail to consider the diagnosis on presentation, U.S. hospital laboratory technologists have very limited experience in detecting and identifying malaria parasites, and reporting of malaria to state health departments is sporadic in many states. In this study, a rapid malaria diagnostic test, the OptiMAL test (DiaMed; under license from Flow Inc., Portland, Oreg.) was evaluated in six U.S. hospitals and compared with results of microscopy. The OptiMAL test is a 15-min rapid immunochromatographic test that both identifies and differentiates Plasmodium falciparum from non-P. falciparum malaria parasites on the basis of the detection of parasite lactate dehydrogenase in a drop of patient blood. A total of 216 specimens from patients suspected of having malaria were tested. Results indicated that 43 samples (20%) were positive for malaria parasites by microscopy (32 P. falciparum, 11 non-P. falciparum) while 42 (19%) were positive by OptiMAL (31 P. falciparum, 11 non-P. falciparum). The sensitivity of the OptiMAL test was 98%; its specificity was 100%, with positive and negative predictive values of 100 and 99%, respectively. Participating hospital physicians and laboratory directors independently reported that the OptiMAL rapid malaria test was accurate, easy to use, and well accepted by those working in their diagnostic laboratories. The overall conclusion was that integration of the OptiMAL rapid malaria test into the U.S. health care infrastructure would provide an important and easy-to-use tool for the timely diagnosis of malaria."

CD008122,0,2692868,0,Comparative analysis of ELISAs employing repetitive peptides to detect antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites.,"In the last few years, a number of different recombinant and synthetic peptides consisting of the repetitive sequence of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (NANP)n have been produced and used to develop immunoassays for the detection of antibodies against P. falciparum sporozoites in human sera. A comparative study of three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that employed different (NANP)n peptides (the synthetic peptides (NANP)3 and (NANP)40 as well as the recombinant peptides R32tet32 and R32LR) was carried out using serum samples from individuals who were living in different malaria-endemic areas. The results obtained for these peptide-based ELISAs were compared with those obtained for an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) that used glutaraldehyde-fixed sporozoites. All the methods tested exhibited 100% specificity on sera from persons not exposed to malaria, good reproducibility (coefficients of variation ranged from 3% to 15% for peptide-based ELISAs), and good sensitivity. Reproducibility and sensitivity were lower for the IFA than for the peptide-based ELISAs, perhaps because of the subjective element in the interpretation of the results which is inherent in the IFA method. ELISAs based on peptides that contain a higher number of (NANP) repeats, i.e., (NANP)40 and R32tet32 or R32LR, gave results which correlated better with each other than with those obtained with the ELISA that employed a shorter (NANP)3 peptide. (NANP)n-based ELISAs are relatively simple and inexpensive methods for the detection of anti-P. falciparum sporozoite antibodies and can readily be used in epidemiological research in the field. These assays could contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the host-parasite relationship in malaria research."
CD008122,0,10232784,1,Application of the ParaSight-F dipstick test for malaria diagnosis in a district control program.,"A rapid test for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infections based on the detection of histidine-rich-protein II, the ParaSight-F test, was evaluated after introduction in a district malaria control program in Uganda. Suspected treatment failures, pregnant women and infants with clinical malaria and general fever cases were tested at health facilities in malaria hypo-, meso- and holoendemic areas. A total of 1326 tests were carried out by health unit staff, cross read by experienced laboratory staff and results compared with thick film microscopy as the standard. Rater agreement in reading the dipstick result between health unit staff and laboratory staff was high, kappa index 0.94 (0.88-0.99). Sensitivity was 99.6% (99.0-100) for parasite densities above 500/microl, 98.6% (97.7-99.6) for densities above 50/microl and 22.2% (8.6-42.3) for densities below 10/microl. With the applied testing strategies no differences were found between endemicity levels or patient categories. Specificity was 86.2% (83.3-88.8) overall, but significantly higher in general fever cases (92.7%) compared to the other patient groups (84.3%, P=0.009). At the given prevalences positive predictive values (ppv) were above 80% and negative predictive values (npv) above 90% in all cases except in pregnant women (ppv: 77.8%). We conclude that in certain situations this test is an alternative to microscopy to improve diagnostic facilities for case management in malaria control programs in endemic African countries."

One hundred four sera from U.S. residents were used to determine a cut-off value for reactivity. Test sera were considered reactive when the absorbance was greater than that at the 95th percentile of the control sera. Sera from 112 Kenyans living in an area of holoendemic malaria transmission were tested. Of the total number of sera, 65% had detectable antibody to (NANP)3. The percentage of reactive sera increased from 41% in sera from children under 4 years of age to 85% in sera from adults 20 to 39 years of age. The high exposure to malaria parasites of the Kenyans was reflected in indirect fluorescent antibody assay titers to blood stage P. falciparum parasites. All of the Kenyan sera had antibody present at titers greater than 1:256."
CD008122,0,9660461,0,Immune response and lack of immune response to Plasmodium falciparum P126 antigen and its amino-terminal repeat in malaria-infected humans.,"A parasitophorous vacuole protein of Plasmodium falciparum, p126, is a potential candidate for a malaria vaccine. Its N-terminal region, composed of six repeats of eight amino acids, appears to be involved in the induction of protective immunity against P. falciparum challenge in monkeys. This study evaluated the immune response to p126 and to its N-terminal region (Nt47) in patients (n = 45) living in a malaria-endemic area of Brazil (Colina, Porto Velho, Rondonia). Cellular proliferative responses against Nt47 were low and infrequent. The study of the humoral immune response demonstrated that 95% of the patients had detectable anti-p126 antibodies and 77% had anti-Nt47 antibodies. Analysis of the antibody isotypes specific for Nt47 revealed that all four IgG subclasses were present and individuals with higher levels of anti-Nt47 cytophilic IgG antibody (IgG1 + IgG3/IgG2 + IgG4) had significantly lower parasitemia levels, suggesting that antibodies to the N-terminal region of the p126 protein may contribute to acquisition of immunity to P. falciparum malaria."

CD008122,0,1431149,0,Capture ELISA for IgM antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum glutamate rich protein.,This report describes a novel mu chain capture ELISA for the detection of IgM antibodies against a Plasmodium falciparum antigen. A fragment of the 220 kDa P. falciparum glutamate rich protein containing amino acid residues 489-1271 was expressed in E. coli as a recombinant chimeric beta-galactosidase fusion protein and used as antigen after purification and biotinylation. Specific IgM antibodies were found in 51% (39/77) of sera from adult Liberians immune to malaria. The binding of IgM antibodies was specific for the malaria portion of the fusion protein and no cross-reactivity was found in sera from patients with IgM antibodies due to other diseases. Inhibition studies with a fusion protein containing amino acid residues 816-1134 (GLURP816-1134) representing the carboxy-terminal repeat region suggested a different use of epitopes for IgM antibodies in different individuals.
CD008122,0,769572,0,Single-dose therapy of Falciparum malaria using pyrimethamine in combination with diformyldapsone or sulfadoxine.,"Patients with naturally acquired chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria were studied in Thailand. The fixed combination of pyrimethamine 75 mg and sulfadoxine 1,500 mg (adult dose) cured 85% of patients with an average pretreatment parasite count of 60,000 per mm(3). The fixed combination of pyrimethamine 50 mg and 800 mg diformyldapsone (DFD) cured 43% of patients with an average pretreatment parasite count of only 17,000 per mm(3). The difference in cure rates was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Pyrimethamine alone was ineffective. Pyrimethamine-DFD, in the dose tested, was not sufficiently active for the treatment of established infections. Pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine did produce an acceptable cure rate but clinical improvement was often slow. We do not recommend that pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine be administered alone. Optimal results are obtained when a short course of quinine (2 to 6 days) is given until parasitemia has been eliminated, then a dose of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine to assist in the radical cure of the falciparum infection. A modification to the W.H.O. classification is suggested. An RIII response (early treatment failure) is diagnosed if the patient's clinical condition and/or parsite density worsens within a few hours after administration of the test regimen; distinct improvement occurring within a few hours of the subsequent initiation of an intravenous infusion of quinine confirms the diagnosis of an RIII response. The RII response has been defined as marked reduction, but not clearance of asexual parasitemia. It is suggested that an RII response may be diagnosed before 7 days have elapsed."
CD008122,0,12409392,1,Evaluation of the ICT malaria P.f/P.v and the OptiMal rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in febrile returned travellers.,"Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are less reliant on expert microscopy and have the potential to reduce errors in malaria diagnosis but have not been extensively evaluated in nonimmune persons or in countries where infection is not endemic. We evaluated the ICT P.f/P.v (ICT-Amrad, Sydney, Australia) and OptiMal (Flow Inc., Portland, Oreg.) assays prospectively for the diagnosis of malaria in 158 specimens from 144 febrile returned travellers in Australia by using expert microscopy and PCR as reference standards. Malaria was diagnosed in 93 specimens from 87 patients by expert microscopy, with 3 additional specimens from recently treated patients testing positive for Plasmodium falciparum by PCR. For the diagnosis of asexual-stage P. falciparum malaria, the sensitivity and specificity of the ICT P.f/P.v assay were 97 and 90%, respectively, and those of the OptiMal assay were 85 and 96%, respectively. The ICT P.f/P.v assay missed one infection with a density of 45 parasites/ micro l, whereas the OptiMal assay missed infections up to 2,500/ micro l; below 1,000/ micro l, its sensitivity was only 43%. For the diagnosis of P. vivax malaria, the sensitivity and specificity of the ICT P.f/P.v assay were 44 and 100%, respectively, and those of the OptiMal assay were 80 and 97%, respectively. Both assays missed infections with parasite densities over 5,000/ micro l: up to 10,000/ micro l with the former and 5,300/ micro l with the latter. Despite the high sensitivity of the ICT P.f/P.v assay for P. falciparum malaria, caution is warranted before RDTs are widely adopted for the diagnosis of malaria in nonimmune patients or in countries where malaria is not endemic."
CD008122,0,7525337,0,Toxoplasma gondii: a monoclonal antibody that inhibits intracellular replication.,"During its intracellular life cycle within the infected host cell, Toxoplasma gondii is able to undergo rapid asexual replication. Neither the mechanism by which the parasite initiates this process nor the requirements for maintaining it are understood. We produced a monoclonal antibody, 1B8, that identifies a parasite antigen of approximate M(r) 97 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. The epitope recognized by mAb 1B8 appears as a collection of vesicular structures scattered throughout the cell cytoplasm. When RH strain parasites are incubated with mAb 1B8 in the absence of serum complement, parasite growth is inhibited by > 90% as determined by radioisotope incorporation. Both attachment and invasion assays show that neither of these parasite-host cell interactions are inhibited by the mAb. However, a marked reduction in the number of intracellular rosettes was observed following mAb treatment of the parasites. Viable extracellular parasites are able to endocytose mAb 1B8. Once within the parasite cytosol the antibody recognizes the vesicular structures similar to those observed with fixed parasites. Immunofluorescence assays with Besnoitia jellisoni and Plasmodium falciparum show that the epitope recognized by mAb 1B8 is conserved among Coccidiae but not the kinetoplastid Leishmania."
CD008122,0,9691337,0,[ARDS in plasmodium vivax malaria].,"Acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, ARDS, hypoglycaemia, coma or epileptic seizures are manifestations of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. On the other hand, vivax malaria or benign tertian malaria is usually free from complications. In the present report we describe a case of acute tertian malaria with a severe and complicated course. In this situation bacterial coinfection should always be suspected and treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics, until the results of cultures are available. Mixed plasmodial infection (P. vivax and P. falciparum) must be excluded by repeated and meticulous examination of blood smears. Newer techniques such as PCR processing or ParaSight F Test are mentioned."
CD008122,0,8372960,0,"Longitudinal study of naturally acquired humoral immune responses against the merozoite surface protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax in patients from Rondonia, Brazil.","A longitudinal study on the naturally acquired humoral immune responses against the merozoite surface protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax (PvMSP-1) was performed in malaria patients from the Brazilian Amazon region of Rondonia. We have previously cloned and expressed a recombinant protein, ICB2-5, that encodes 508 amino acids from the N-terminal portion of the PvMSP-1 protein. This affinity-purified polypeptide was tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a one-year longitudinal study using sera from 34 patients who had at least one malaria infection during the study period. The results demonstrated that more than 90% of the sera from patients having experienced more than three previous malaria infections contained antibodies to ICB2-5 at the time of a new clinical episode. Unexpectedly, more than half of these multiple-infected patients had an antibody response to ICB2-5 in which the predominant isotype was IgM. In contrast, more than 83% of the sera from these same patients contained predominantly IgG antibodies against total blood-stage antigen preparations. To determine if these results were due to the lack of boosting against this portion of the PvMSP-1 molecule, the presence of IgG antibodies to ICB2-5 in the sera from 11 patients who had consecutive malarial episodes during the study year was investigated. Five of these eleven patients failed to produce IgG antibodies to ICB2-5 even after 1-3 infections. Thus, these results suggest that no boosting against this region of the PvMSP-1 molecule was achieved by natural infections among these patients."

As in Western populations the RA sera showed significantly increased levels of anti-P62 antibodies though in our study the mean titres were only elevated twofold above the controls.

CD008122,0,1712912,0,Definition of the epitope recognized by the Plasmodium falciparum-reactive human monoclonal antibody 33G2.,"The human monoclonal antibody 33G2 has earlier been shown to inhibit merozoite reinvasion of red blood cells in Plasmodium falciparum cultures in vitro and to inhibit cytoadherence of infected red blood cells to melanoma cells in vitro. 33G2 cross-reacts with a family of P. falciparum antigens, Ag332, Pf11.1 and Pf155/RESA, sharing a common feature of repeated sequences consisting of regularly spaced pairs of glutamic acid. Peptides corresponding to residues 2-19 of the known amino acid sequence of Ag332 have been shown earlier to have the highest inhibitory capacity of antibody binding to infected red blood cells. Using the PEPSCAN method, overlapping hepta-, hexa-, penta- and tetrapeptides corresponding to residues 1-19 of the known sequence of Ag332 were synthesized. Antibody fine specificity was examined by synthesizing an octapeptide (residues 1-8) and all possible single amino acid substitutions. The monoclonal antibody was shown to react with a linear 5-amino acid-long sequence corresponding to Ag332 residues 3-7: VTEEI. These amino acids were irreplaceable or only partially replaceable in the replacement set analysis. Furthermore, epitope analogs corresponding to sequences contained within the Pf11.1 repeats and overlapping heptapeptides corresponding to Pf155/RESA repeats were synthesized. Reactivity to epitope analogs and Pf155/RESA peptides provided information which may explain antibody cross-reactivity. The defined epitope of this monoclonal antibody is of interest as a potential B cell epitope for the development of a malaria subunit vaccine."
CD008122,0,9231209,0,Chlorproguanil/dapsone for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in young children: pharmacokinetics and therapeutic range.,"The disposition of chlorproguanil/dapsone (one daily dose for 3 d of 1.2 and 2.4 mg/kg respectively) has been studied in young children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, to provide data complementary to a clinical trial of this drug combination. Unbound concentrations of chlorcycloguanil (the active metabolite of chlorproguanil) and dapsone in clinical samples have been related to the unbound drug concentrations which produced defined outcomes in tests in vitro of drug efficacy and toxicity. Twelve children with uncomplicated malaria were treated: all cleared parasitaemia within 72 h and made uneventful recoveries. After the first dose of chlorproguanil/dapsone the maximum unbound chlorcycloguanil concentration in clinical samples (19 ng/mL [about 60 nM]) was 2 orders of magnitude above the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for this drug against the K39 stain of P. falciparum, while falling 2 orders of magnitude below its IC50 against human bone marrow cells; the maximum unbound dapsone concentration in clinical samples (160 ng/mL [about 645 nM]) was 10-fold higher than its IC50 against the K39 strain. However, because of the rapid elimination of chlorproguanil from the body (half-life 12.6 +/- 6.3 h), the minimum fractional inhibitory concentrations of unbound chlorcycloguanil/dapsone against the K39 strain were probably exceeded for no more than 6 d. These data, together with the clinical trial, will be helpful in deciding whether current chlorproguanil/dapsone doses are optimal for the treatment of falciparum malaria."
CD008122,0,16153238,0,New approaches in vaccine development for parasitic infections.,"Vaccines have had a tremendous impact on the control of infectious diseases. Not only are vaccines potentially the least expensive mechanism to combat infectious diseases, under optimal conditions, widespread vaccination can result in disease eradication - as in the case of smallpox. Despite this great potential, vaccines have had little impact on human parasitic infections. The reasons for this are many - these eukaryotic pathogens are genetically and biologically complex organisms, some with elaborate life cycles and well-honed immune evasion mechanisms. Additionally, our understanding of the mechanisms of immune control of many parasitic infections -- of what constitutes an effective immune response and of how to induce high-quality immunological memory -- is not fully developed. This review attempts to highlight recent advances that could impact vaccine discovery and development in parasitic infections and proposes areas where future studies may lead to breakthroughs in vaccines for the agents of parasitic diseases. There are several other recent reviews highlighting the results of vaccine trials, specifically in the malaria field."
CD008122,0,16514282,0,Usefulness of the recombinant liver stage antigen-3 for an early serodiagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection.,"In order to develop tools for an early serodiagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection, we evaluated the usefulness of P. falciparum liver stage antigen-3 (LSA-3) as a serodiagnostic antigen. A portion of LSA-3 gene was cloned, and its recombinant protein (rLSA-3) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by column chromatography. The purified rLSA-3 and 120 test blood/serum samples collected from inhabitants in malaria-endemic areas of Mandalay, Myanmar were used for this study. In microscopic examinations of blood samples, P. falciparum positive rate was 39.1% (47/120) in thin smear trials, and 33.3% (40/120) in thick smear trials. Although the positive rate associated with the rLSA-3 (30.8%) was lower than that of the blood stage antigens (70.8%), rLSA-3 based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay could detect 12 seropositive cases (10.0%), in which blood stage antigens were not detected. These results indicate that the LSA-3 is a useful antigen for an early serodiagnosis of P. falciparum infection."
CD008122,0,3332505,0,Sera from Cameroon recognize proteins of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from geographically diverse areas of the world.,"Immunological reactions of clinically-defined sera collected from 176 children and adults (3 to 63 years of age) living in malaria endemic regions of Cameroon were evaluated by ELISA, growth inhibition studies and immunoprecipitation assays using different parasite isolates from geographically diverse areas. The proportions of sera positive by ELISA and with positive growth inhibitory activity tended to increase with increased age. SDS-PAGE analyses of immunoprecipitates using [35S]methionine labelled parasite polypeptides revealed that a wide range of proteins was recognized by the sera. There were many similarities in the patterns of antigens immunoprecipitated in the different isolates, particularly when immune sera were used. Variability in response was more evident in sera collected from children. These findings suggest that strains may share components which generate protective immunity."

CD008122,0,1455910,0,Safety and immunogenicity in volunteers of a recombinant Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein malaria vaccine produced in Lepidopteran cells.,"A recombinant Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) antigen (rPfCSA) was produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector containing the entire CS gene. This near full-length CS antigen was adsorbed onto aluminium phosphate for use as a malaria vaccine. In a study of safety and immunogenicity, 20 volunteers were divided into four groups of five each and inoculated intramuscularly with 10, 100, 500 or 1000 micrograms of vaccine. Primary vaccinations were followed by two booster immunizations at 2 and 6 months. Three volunteers developed prominent local reactions manifested as tenderness, redness and swelling at the injection site following the second or third vaccination. All symptoms resolved spontaneously within 72 h. Postimmunization sera from six of 20 volunteers showed seroconversions as measured by Western blot, using rPfCSA as antigen. However, specific anti-CS protein antibody could not be detected by indirect immunoflourescence against intact sporozoites or by ELISA using rPfCSA or peptide to the repeat region. In addition, 18 of 20 volunteers developed antibody to baculovirus proteins as determined by ELISA and/or Western blot. Antigen-driven replication studies using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinees failed to detect proliferative responses specific to CS protein. This recombinant CS protein vaccine, as formulated, was minimally immunogenic in humans."

CD008122,0,1855998,0,Antibody response of humans to the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium vivax.,"We studied the interaction of sera from residents of an area in northern Peru where vivax malaria is endemic with four recombinant DNA-derived circumsporozoite (CS) proteins of Plasmodium vivax. The antigens used in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay included one Escherichia coli-produced and three Saccharomyces cerevisiae-produced recombinant proteins. Three of the proteins (NS1(81)V20, Vivax-1, and Vivax-2) contain the entire central repeat region of the P. vivax CS protein, and one protein (Vivax-3) contains only two repeat sequences. Vivax-1, Vivax-2, and Vivax-3 contain different lengths of sequences flanking the repeats. A higher percentage of the sera had antibodies to Vivax-2 and Vivax-3, the two proteins containing the longest nonrepeat sequences, than to NS1(81)V20 or Vivax-1. Children less than 5 years of age did not have immunoglobulin G antibodies to NS1(81)V20; however, they had antibodies to Vivax-1, Vivax-2, and Vivax-3. The finding that individuals living in a malaria-endemic area produce antibodies to peptides containing nonrepeat regions of the CS protein emphasizes the need to characterize the immune response to these regions in naturally exposed and experimentally immunized humans."

CD008122,0,15908388,0,Safety and enhanced immunogenicity of a hepatitis B core particle Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine formulated in adjuvant Montanide ISA 720 in a phase I trial.,"Highly purified subunit vaccines require potent adjuvants in order to elicit optimal immune responses. In a previous phase I trial, an alum formulation of ICC-1132, a malaria vaccine candidate comprising hepatitis B core (HBc) virus-like particle containing Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein epitopes, was shown to elicit Plasmodium falciparum-specific antibody and cellular responses. The present study was designed as a single-blind, escalating-dose phase I trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of single intramuscular doses of ICC-1132 formulated in the more potent water-in-oil adjuvant Montanide ISA 720 (ICC-1132/ISA 720). The vaccine was safe and well tolerated, with transient injection site pain as the most frequent complaint. All vaccinees that received either 20 mug or 50 mug of ICC-1132/ISA 720 developed antiimmunogen and anti-HBc antibodies. The majority of volunteers in these two groups developed sporozoite-specific antibodies, predominantly of opsonizing immunoglobulin G subtypes. Peak titers and persistence of parasite-specific antibody following a single injection of the ISA 720 formulated vaccine were comparable to those obtained following two to three immunizations with alum-adsorbed ICC-1132. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ICC-1132/ISA 720 vaccinees proliferated and released cytokines (interleukin 2 and gamma interferon) when stimulated with recombinant P. falciparum CS protein, and CS-specific CD4(+) T-cell lines were established from volunteers with high levels of antibodies to the repeat region. The promising results obtained with a single dose of ICC-1132 formulated in Montanide ISA 720 encourage further clinical development of this malaria vaccine candidate."

CD008122,0,18523022,0,Naturally acquired Duffy-binding protein-specific binding inhibitory antibodies confer protection from blood-stage Plasmodium vivax infection.,"Individuals residing in malaria-endemic regions acquire protective immunity after repeated infection with malaria parasites; however, mechanisms of protective immunity and their immune correlates are poorly understood. Blood-stage infection with Plasmodium vivax depends completely on interaction of P. vivax Duffy-binding protein (PvDBP) with the Duffy antigen on host erythrocytes. Here, we performed a prospective cohort treatment/reinfection study of children (5-14 years) residing in a P. vivax-endemic region of Papua New Guinea (PNG) in which children were cleared of blood-stage infection and then examined biweekly for reinfection for 25 weeks. To test the hypothesis that naturally acquired binding inhibitory antibodies (BIAbs) targeting PvDBP region II (PvDBPII) provide protection against P. vivax infection, we used a quantitative receptor-binding assay to distinguish between antibodies that merely recognize PvDBP and those that inhibit binding to Duffy. The presence of high-level BIAbs (>90% inhibition of PvDBPII-Duffy binding, n = 18) before treatment was associated with delayed time to P. vivax reinfection diagnosed by light microscopy (P = 0.02), 55% reduced risk of P. vivax reinfection (Hazard's ratio = 0.45, P = 0.04), and 48% reduction in geometric mean P. vivax parasitemia (P < 0.001) when compared with children with low-level BIAbs (n = 148). Further, we found that stable, high-level BIAbs displayed strain-transcending inhibition by reducing reinfection with similar efficiency of PNG P. vivax strains characterized by six diverse PvDBPII haplotypes. These observations demonstrate a functional correlate of protective immunity in vivo and provide support for developing a vaccine against P. vivax malaria based on PvDBPII."

CD008122,0,9230797,0,Assessment of age-dependent immunity to malaria in transmigrants.,"Sixty-six Javanese transmigrants moving from Java, an area of very low malaria transmission, to Irian Jaya, an area of high malaria transmission, were monitored to evaluate the effects of exposure to malaria transmission and age on resistance to infection and the induction of humoral immunity. The risk of acquiring Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia was not statistically greater in children (5-15 years of age) than in adults (> 15 years of age) during the first 14 months of exposure. However, during the cross-sectional survey at 14 months of exposure. children did have significantly higher P. falciparum asexual blood-stage parasite densities. Serum antibody titers to R32LR, a peptide containing sequences from the P. falciparum circumsporozoite repeat region, and MSP19, a proteolytic fragment of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) from P. falciparum, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Exposure for both six and 14 months produced statistically significant increased antibody titers to both R32LR and MSP-1; no age-dependent difference in antibody titers was observed. In this population, exposure to malaria transmission induced antibodies to antigens associated with immunity to malaria. In addition, we noted an age-dependent difference in the parasitemia density of P. falciparum."
CD008122,0,14572205,0,Laboratory-based diagnosis of brucellosis--a review of the literature. Part I: Techniques for direct detection and identification of Brucella spp.,"Brucellosis is a world-wide re-emerging zoonosis and the most frequent laboratory-acquired bacterial infection, causing severe disease in humans with unspecific clinical signs affecting numerous organs. Contact with infected animals, ingestion of contaminated animal products and handling of Brucella isolates in laboratories are risk factors. Various other febrile illnesses, e.g. malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and tularemia may present with the same symptoms. Therefore, clinical diagnosis is difficult to establish but effective therapy requires an early diagnosis. Vaccines for humans are still not commercially available. Blood culturing of Brucella is time-consuming and not reliable. Thus diagnosis is usually based on indirect serological tests, i.e. serum agglutination test, complement fixation or the Coombs test. However, these 'conventional' serological tests lack sensitivity and specificity. Hence, a combination of various tests is mandatory for a definite diagnosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays can be used for screening and confirmation of brucellosis in one step. Molecular techniques like the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism are needed to differentiate species and strains within the genus Brucella. This review will summarize advantages and disadvantages of the techniques used in clinical laboratories for direct detection and identification of Brucella spp."

CD008122,0,11964891,0,Artemisinin and derivatives: the future for malaria treatment?,"The isolation in 1972 of artemisinin by Chinese scientists, and their development of all the derivatives now used in the treatment of malaria today, were of outstanding importance. The results which have accumulated both from the Chinese work and from that subsequently conducted on a worldwide basis provide for a relatively comprehensive understanding of the chemistry, pharmacological profiles, toxicology, metabolism, and effects on the malaria parasite. The optimal regimens for use in the field are also apparent, particularly in combinations with longer half-life quinoline antimalarials. Thus the future use of the artemisinin class of drug appears assured. However, the mechanism of action needs to be clarified. More importantly from a clinical viewpoint, problems inherent in the current derivatives must be addressed, particularly that of neurotoxicity, if new artemisinin derivatives are to be introduced in a normal drug regulatory environment. The application of established principles of modern drug design should indeed allow for the first truly rationally designed, in so far as the target is still unknown, derivatives to come to hand."
CD008122,0,17220424,0,Comparison of a SYBR green I-based assay with a histidine-rich protein II enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for in vitro antimalarial drug efficacy testing and application to clinical isolates.,"In vitro drug susceptibility testing with the malaria parasite has been used to assess the antimalarial activities of new compounds and to monitor drug resistance in field isolates. We investigated the validity of a SYBR green I fluorescent-based assay under various culture conditions and compared the assay results to those of previously published histidine-rich protein II (HRPII) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Reference strains of Plasmodium falciparum were cultured in vitro by using standard conditions in complete medium with and without phenol red before they were dispensed into 96-well plates predosed with chloroquine, mefloquine, or quinine. Following incubation, the culture supernatants were divided and the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were determined by using a SYBR green I-based method and the HRPII capture ELISA method. There were no significant differences in IC50 values when phenol red was included in the medium. The IC50s and the IC90s of the antimalarials tested by both methods were similar or identical for each of the reference strains. Fresh clinical isolates of P. falciparum collected from imported cases of malaria in Lyon, France, were tested for in vitro resistance to chloroquine and mefloquine by using the validated SYBR green I and HRPII ELISA methods. The SYBR green I-based method was able to calculate IC50 and IC90 values similar or identical to those calculated by the HRPII assay with fresh clinical samples without removal of white blood cells. The SYBR green I-based method for determination of drug sensitivity levels produced results comparable to those produced by other methods, showing that this method can be used routinely to conduct surveillance for drug resistance in P. falciparum with fresh or cultured parasites."
CD008122,0,14503385,0,Hospital waste management and it's probable health effect: a lesson learned from Bangladesh.,"A study was conducted to evaluate the current status of hospital waste management (HWM) in Bangladesh. The aim is to recognize the health effect of the existing practice, to determine the awareness level of doctors and nurses about hospital waste, to identify the weaknesses, and to provide suggestions for improvement. Hospital staff, waste pickers, and local residents were interviewed while in depth field observation, which included sample collection and laboratory analysis was also conducted. Through this investigation, it has been quite evident that a satisfactory hospital waste management system in government hospitals and several private clinics is severely lacking. At present, Bangladesh has no rigorous laws or regulation, which are enforced in this area. The waste is generally dumped together in a public place such as the hospital surroundings, the roadside or City Corporation dustbin. Many doctors and nurses are not fully aware about what constitutes as medical waste. Health care workers have only a basic understanding of health care and do not perceive handling or disposal of medial waste as a hazardous work. Laboratory analysis shows existing contamination of infectious agents in the environment. Some staff members interviewed were suffering from various kinds of infectious diseases such as viral hepatitis B/C, typhoid, skin disease/allergy, diarrhea, dysentery, tuberculosis, and malaria. During field observation it was discovered that improved HWM systems have only recently been introduced in a small number of private hospitals and clinics, some of which could be used as references to formulate guidelines for reaching the optimal at the national level. The study indicates that there is a need to improve the handling and disposal methods of hospital waste in almost all the available medical facilities. There are a few NGOs that have started awareness building and training on waste management for selected hospital staff and NGO officials. Based on the analysis of the situation, several suggestions and recommendations have been made to aid in the development of a waste management system."

We studied a total of 200 patients, including 62 patients with schistocytosis, 8 postsplenectomy patients, and 108 healthy controls. Peripheral blood (2 microl) was stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated (PE) antihemoglobin antibody (anti-Hb) in 0.6% (w/v) NaCl solution, and analyzed by flow cytometry omitting the washing step. The proportion of RBCs stained by anti-Hb was 0.55% (SD +/-0.23%) in normal controls and was significantly higher in patients with schistocytosis (2.95+/-2.95%, p <0.001). Six of 108 blood samples from normal controls and 60 of 62 samples from schistocytosis patients showed > or =1.01% stained RBCs (ie, values > mean+2SD of normal controls). The number of schistocytes counted by microscopic examination correlated with the proportion of RBCs stained by anti-Hb (r = 0.637, p <0.001). The proportions of stained RBCs in blood samples with malaria, spherocytosis, and elliptocytosis were also significantly higher than in normal controls. However, the results in postsplenectomy and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) patients were not significantly different from the normal controls; the number of schistocytes in postsplenectomy patients was not related to the proportion of RBCs stained by anti-Hb. Based on these findings, flow cytometry of damaged RBCs using anti-Hb in hypotonic solution is a simple, sensitive, and accurate method to detect active hemolysis."

CD008122,0,11931032,0,Evaluation of a dipstick malaria sporozoite panel assay for detection of naturally infected mosquitoes.,"The determination of the presence or absence of malaria sporozoites in wild-caught Anopheles mosquitoes remains an integral component to the understanding of the transmission dynamics in endemic areas. To improve that capability, there has been on-going development of a new device using dipstick immunochromatographic technology for simplifying the testing procedure and reducing the time required to obtain results. As part of a larger multi-center effort, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a prototype malaria sporozoite antigen panel assay (Medical Analysis Systems, Camarillo, CA) against three human Plasmodium species/polymorphs. The wicking (dipstick) assay was compared against a standard parasite antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of human circumsporozoite protein (CSP) in wild-caught mosquitoes. Over 6,800 Anopheles mosquitoes, representing 20 species collected from malaria endemic areas of Indonesia were tested either individually or in pools of up to 10 mosquitoes each. From 1,442 pooled test strip assays and ELISA formats, nine mosquito pools were found reactive for P.falciparum, P. vivax 210, or P. vivax 247 CSP. There was complete concordance between test strip results and ELISA results. Sensitivity was 100% and given some minor problems with false positives or negatives, specificity (n = 488) was 97%. Most strips judged as false positive produced very weak signals compared with negative control blank strips and paired ELISA-negative samples. The dipstick test proved technically simpler to perform and interpret than the ELISA and results were obtained within 15 min of exposure to mosquito suspension. This qualitative assay appears an attractive alternative to the CSP ELISA for detection of sporozoites in fresh or dried mosquitoes."

CD008122,0,16210483,0,Diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease among children in Kenya with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin G antibodies to pneumococcal surface adhesin A.,"Diagnostic techniques for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children are insensitive and underestimate both the burden of disease and the cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV). Consequently, there is little demand for the highly effective PCV outside the United States and Europe. In Kenya, diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults was achieved with a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.98 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) of paired plasma samples for immunoglobulin G (IgG) to pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA). We aimed to validate the same technique in children. We assayed paired blood samples from 98 children with IPD, 95 age-matched children with malaria/anemia, and 97 age-matched healthy controls by using an ELISA for anti-PsaA IgG. Sensitivity and specificity were determined in IPD patients and healthy controls. Specificity (0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 0.99) and sensitivity (0.42; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.52) were optimized at a 2.7-fold rise in anti-PsaA antibody concentration. Sensitivity was improved to a maximum of 0.50 by restricting testing to children of <2 years old, by excluding IPD patients who were not sampled on the first day of presentation, and by incorporating high existing antibody concentrations in the analysis. Assay performance was independent of nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci at recruitment. This assay improves on existing diagnostic tools for IPD in children but would still leave over half of all cases undetected in epidemiological studies. Effective diagnosis of pneumococcal disease in children is urgently required but poorly served by existing technology."

CD008122,0,14742196,0,Genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum pyrimethamine resistance by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.,"Increasing resistance, recrudescences, and treatment failure have led to the replacement of chloroquine with the combination of pyrimethamine (PYR) and sulfadoxine (SDX) as the first-line antimalarial drugs for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in several areas where this disease is endemic. The development of resistance to PYR-SDX is favored by incomplete treatment courses or by subtherapeutic levels in plasma. PYR-SDX resistance has been associated with several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and the P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthetase (pfdhps) genes. We have established assays based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) that conveniently allow the identification of SNPs associated with PYR resistance. Variants occurring at codon positions 16, 51, 59, and 108 of the pfdhfr gene were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS in synthetic oligonucleotides to determine the detection threshold. In addition, 63 blood samples from subjects with P. falciparum parasitemia of various degrees were analyzed. The results were compared to those obtained by DNA sequencing of the respective gene fragment. The results of MALDI-TOF MS and DNA sequencing were consistent in 40 samples. In 23 samples two or three pfdhfr variants were detected by MALDI-TOF assays, whereas DNA-sequencing revealed one variant only. Simultaneous detection of two different mutations by biplex assays was, in principle, feasible. As demonstrated by the example of PYR resistance, MALDI-TOF MS allows for rapid and automated high-throughput assessment of drug sensitivity in P. falciparum malaria."

Despite schizonticidal treatment and multisystem support in intensive care the husband died. The selection of chemoprophylactic agents for this couple was not ideal and the duration of therapy before exposure to risk was inadequate. Severe infection with plasmodium falciparum is life-threatening and requires early diagnosis. It is best managed in an intensive care unit where continuous assessment may enable rapid detection of clinical deterioration and allow appropriate treatment to be instituted. The diagnosis should be considered in symptomatic patients who have travelled through areas where malaria is endemic. Recognised guidelines for the prescription of malarial chemoprophylaxis should be followed to ensure adequate protection.

A reemerging disease that is severe but curable].,"In tropical regions of Africa, frequently subject to social and political upheavals, there is an ever-present threat of typhus epidemics, as shown by the recent typhus outbreak in Burundi in 1997. Epidemic typhus should be systematically suspected in certain epidemiological conditions: famine, war, high-density populations (refugee camps, prisons), the presence of body louse in the clothing, and in the presence of certain clinical findings: severe infectious syndrome (temperature above 38 C), severe pain and muscle weakness, with coughing and severe neurological signs. The rapid diagnosis and treatment of typhus are essential. The prognosis has improved, thanks to the specific antibiotics that are currently available, particularly doxycycline, prescribed as a single oral dose of 200 mg for adults or of 100 mg for children. However, the prognosis still depends to a large extent on the speed of diagnosis. Typhus epidemics could be effectively predicted and limited if the measures for control of the body louse recommended by the World Health Organization were applied in the areas with the most favorable epidemiological conditions."

Sequential, follow-up, blood specimens were obtained from day 1 to day 3, 4 or 5 post-admission. Thin and thick films prepared from these samples were examined for the presence of malarial parasites, and the intensities of parasitaemia were estimated. In addition, each specimen was tested with the OptiMAL dipstick, Rhodamine-123 fluorescence staining and, on specimens collected on day 1 and the last follow-up before discharge, by a PCR-based test. The results showed that OptiMAL has good sensitivity for the initial diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria and also mirrors the decline in viability of the parasites on treatment, giving the potential to follow the efficacy of drug treatment. The results of the PCR-based tests were still positive when the blood film and OptiMAL result were negative. The OptiMAL dipstick compared well with blood-film microscopy for monitoring antimalarial treatment and could be a useful replacement for microscopy to monitor treatment in places where facilities for microscopy are either lacking or inadequate. In developed countries it could be a useful adjunct to blood-film microscopy, and it might permit a reduction in the duration of hospitalization and give an early warning of treatment failure."
CD008122,0,15755603,0,Malaria vaccines: using models of immunity and functional genomics tools to accelerate the development of vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum.,"Naturally acquired immunity and immunity acquired after immunization with attenuated parasites indicate that a vaccine against malaria is feasible. Several obstacles have stymied malaria vaccine development, among them our poor understanding of protective immunity and technical difficulties for studying gene and protein expression in the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. Pregnancy malaria offers a model approach for vaccine development: recent findings have elucidated the basis for disease pathogenesis and protective immunity in this syndrome, and this understanding has focused the effort to identify the optimal antigens for a pregnancy malaria vaccine. In parallel, functional genomics tools are overcoming several of the obstacles for studying protein expression in the malaria parasite, vastly accelerating the pace for antigen discovery. Together, these conceptual and technological advances allow a rational approach to vaccine antigen selection, in which a finite number of antigens are selected from the entire genome by merit of the expression patterns and specific features. These candidate antigens are then subjected to detailed studies according to criteria established by the understanding of pathogenesis and protective immunity, to identify the optimal antigens for inclusion in subunit vaccines."

We compared 2 long-term residential groups with high and low exposure to malaria. The seropositive rate to the peptides was significantly higher with increased exposure. There was no significant difference in response rates to the Pf155/RESA. This may indicate the level of persistent T cell memory in previously primed donors. The seropositive rates to 3 Pf155/RESA peptides and the rates measured by either 3H-thymidine incorporation or IFN-gamma release after stimulation with Pf155/RESA and the peptides were all lower in parasite positive individuals. Even low grade, asymptomatic parasitemia can impair the T cell response in vitro. The lower antibody response in parasite positive subjects may be explained by either antibody consumption or lower protection against malaria parasitemia in subjects with low concentrations of antibodies against the Pf155/RESA antigen."

CD008122,0,17680702,0,Toward a framework for sulfoproteomics: Synthesis and characterization of sulfotyrosine-containing peptides.,"Tyrosine sulfation is one of the most common post-translational modifications in secreted and transmembrane proteins and a key modulator of extracellular protein-protein interactions. Several proteins known to be tyrosine sulfated play important roles in physiological processes, and in some cases a direct link between protein function and tyrosine sulfation has been established. In blood coagulation, tyrosine sulfation of factor VIII is required for efficient binding of von Willebrand factor; in leukocyte adhesion, tyrosine sulfation of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 mediates high-affinity binding to P-selectin; and in leukocyte chemotaxis, tyrosine sulfation of chemokine receptors is required for optimal interaction with chemokine ligands. Furthermore, tyrosine sulfation has been implicated in several infectious diseases. In particular, tyrosine sulfation of the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 is required for viral entry into host cells and tyrosine sulfation of the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines is crucial for erythrocyte invasion by the malaria parasite plasmodium vivax. Despite increasing interest in tyrosine sulfation in recent years, the sulfoproteome still remains largely unexplored. To date, only a relatively small number of sulfotyrosine-containing peptides and proteins have been identified, and a specific role for tyrosine sulfation has not been established for most of these. Here, we provide an overview of the biology and enzymology of tyrosine sulfation and discuss recent developments in preparative and analytical methods that are central to sulfoproteome research."

Thus, many techniques have been developed to reach this purpose. We have compared four of them concerning 196 patients from October, 1996 to January, 1997 in Abidjan. Thick blood film has been chosen as the technique for reference. It has come out that the plasmodic index was 18.3%. The Plasmodium falciparum has been the only encountered species. The different sensitivities of the QBC test and of the Parasight F test reached 100% against 83.3% in the case of the thin blood film. The QBC test and the thin blood film had each a specificity of 100% against 88.1% for the Parasight F test. Unlike the QBC test, the thick blood film and the thin blood film have remained the most difficult to be realised. Therefore, the analysis of parameters of credibility (sensitivity, specificity), predictable values and the time involved will allow in a given situation to use the appropriate biological diagnosis technique."

CD008122,0,11716777,0,Expression and characterization of the Plasmodium falciparum haemoglobinase falcipain-3.,"In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, erythrocytic trophozoites hydrolyse haemoglobin to provide amino acids for parasite protein synthesis. Cysteine protease inhibitors block parasite haemoglobin hydrolysis and development, indicating that cysteine proteases are required for these processes. Three papain-family cysteine protease sequences have been identified in the P. falciparum genome, but the specific roles of their gene products and other plasmodial proteases in haemoglobin hydrolysis are uncertain. Falcipain-2 was recently identified as a principal trophozoite cysteine protease and potential drug target. The present study characterizes the related P. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-3. As is the case with falcipain-2, falcipain-3 is expressed by trophozoites and appears to be located within the food vacuole, the site of haemoglobin hydrolysis. Both proteases require a reducing environment and acidic pH for optimal activity, and both prefer peptide substrates with leucine at the P(2) position. The proteases differ, however, in that falcipain-3 undergoes efficient processing to an active form only at acidic pH, is more active and stable at acidic pH, and has much lower specific activity against typical papain-family peptide substrates, but has greater activity against native haemoglobin. Thus falcipain-3 is a second P. falciparum haemoglobinase that is particularly suited for the hydrolysis of native haemoglobin in the acidic food vacuole. The redundancy of cysteine proteases may offer optimized hydrolysis of both native haemoglobin and globin peptides. Consideration of both proteases will be necessary to evaluate cysteine protease inhibitors as antimalarial drugs."

Two types of RDT were used separately. The dipstick (Optimal-I) that detects circulating pLDH was tested in 168 patients with clinically suspected malaria (fever or recent history of fever) at primary health centers. Microscopy confirmed malaria in 93/168 (55.4%) cases. Monoparasitic P. falciparum infection was identified in 86/93, P. malariae in 3/93, P. vivax in 3/93 and P. ovale in 1/93. A positive Optimal-I test was a highly sensitive indicator of P. falciparum infection with parasitemia exceeding 500 trophozoites/mul (sensitivity of 97.2%; with a specificity of 100%); it also confirmed 6/7 cases of non-P. falciparum malaria. A community malaria survey used the Malaria Hexagon dipstick (detecting P. falciparum-specific HRP2) for 273 patients: 17 (6.2%) RDT tests were positive, and 16 (5.9%) microscopic tests. Although this dipstick did not detect the only case of infection with P. vivax, its specificity was 100% for detection of P. falciparum infection. Installing microscopes and qualified microscopists in the health centers of the one hundred and eleven districts in Madagascar would be extremely difficult, but our results show that RDT is an effective alternative diagnostic tool for daily use as well as for sporadic malaria epidemics. The revised antimalarial treatment policy, involving a drug ten to twenty times more expensive than chloroquine, demonstrates the need to improve malaria diagnosis: presumptive treatment has become prohibitively expensive. RDT can be used to improve malaria case management at the primary heath centers in Madagascar. We discuss the choice of RDTs."

CD008122,0,17557374,0,gammadelta-T cells expressing NK receptors predominate over NK cells and conventional T cells in the innate IFN-gamma response to Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Rapid production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to malaria by the innate immune system may determine resistance to infection, or inflammatory disease. However, conflicting reports exist regarding the identity of IFN-gamma-producing cells that rapidly respond to Plasmodium falciparum. To clarify this area, we undertook detailed phenotyping of IFN-gamma-producing cells across a panel of naive human donors following 24-h exposure to live schizont-infected red blood cells (iRBC). Here, we show that NK cells comprise only a small proportion of IFN-gamma-responding cells and that IFN-gamma production is unaffected by NK cell depletion. Instead, gammadelta-T cells represent the predominant source of innate IFN-gamma, with the majority of responding gammadelta-T cells expressing NK receptors. Malaria-responsive gammadelta-T cells more frequently expressed NKG2A compared to non-responding gammadelta-T cells, while non-responding gammadelta-T cells more frequently expressed CD158a/KIR2DL1. Unlike long-term gammadelta-T cell responses to iRBC, alphabeta-T cell help was not required for innate gammadelta-T cell responses. Diversity was observed among donors in total IFN-gamma output. This was positively associated with CD94 expression on IFN-gamma(+) NK-like gammadelta-T cells. Applied to longitudinal cohort studies in endemic regions, similar comparative phenotyping should allow assessment of the contribution of diverse cell populations and regulatory receptors to risk of infection and disease."

In total, 522 febrile patients were screened for falciparum malaria by rapid diagnostic assays. Of 81 patients (15.5% prevalence) who were positive by the assays and microscopy, 48 were eligible to participate in the 28-day trial. Nine patients defaulted. Chloroquine cured 54% (95% confidence interval, 45.8-61.8) of falciparum-infected patients. Of 18 (46%) patients with treatment failure, 13 (72%) experienced high-grade resistance. Polymorphisms in cg2 and the N86Y mutation in PfMDR1 were not predictive of treatment outcome. A mutation in PfCRT (K76T) was perfectly associated with in vivo chloroquine resistance. However, K76T was also present in in vivo-sensitive isolates, which suggests that the presence of this mutation was necessary, but not sufficient, to predict in vivo outcome in this cohort."

Homologues of HMGB1 were identified and cloned from malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Sequence analyses showed that the P. falciparum HMGB1 (PfHMGB1) exhibits 45, 23 and 18%, while PfHMGB2 shares 42, 21 and 17% homology with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, human and mouse HMG box proteins respectively. Parasite PfHMGB1and PfHMGB2 proteins contain one HMG Box domain similar to B-Box of mammalian HMGB1. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) showed that recombinant PfHMGB1 and PfHMGB2 bind to DNA. Immunofluorescence Assay using specific antibodies revealed that these proteins are expressed abundantly in the ring stage nuclei. Significant levels of PfHMGB1 and PfHMGB2 were also present in the parasite cytosol at trophozoite and schizont stages. Both, PfHMGB1 and PfHMGB2 were found to be potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha from mouse peritoneal macrophages as analyzed by both reverse transcription PCR and by ELISA.

There was no association between hemoglobin levels (<10g/dl and > or = 10g/dl) and malaria, and although there was a good statistical association between temperature and malaria the specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive values were all low, indicating that temperature alone is a poor indicator of the disease. Based on the microscopy results, we found that a presumptive clinical diagnosis dramatically over-diagnosed malaria, and similarly there were a large number of false positives using the ParaSight-F test. We believe that many of the patients had received some form of malaria treatment prior to presentation at the hospital, and that the high number of false positives are explained by persistent antigenemia and the possibility of there being sequestered parasites following incomplete chemotherapy."

Overlapping multiple antigen peptides (MAPs) together spanning residues 199-220 of Pf155/RESA were used to raise antibodies in rabbits. Analysis of the fine specificity of these antibodies revealed that antibodies raised against largely overlapping sequences displayed highly different specificity patterns. Similarly, striking differences were seen when analysing the biological effect of antibodies to these MAPs. Antibodies to the cytoadherence-related motif of Pf155/RESA, as well as antibodies raised against a MAP based on a corresponding band 3 motif, inhibited cytoadherence but not parasite growth.

These findings were reproducible for two hours after sample preparation but deterioration was rapid thereafter. Given its simplicity and sensitivity, QBC test would appear to be a suitable technique for in-field screening programs for human African trypanosomiasis."
CD008122,0,10678681,0,Benefits and dangers of iron during infection.,"Iron is essential for both human and microbial metabolism, and it is therefore important that iron status is maintained at a level that permits optimal immune responses by the host but does not facilitate availability of iron to microorganisms. This paper reviews the role of iron in resistance to infection, with particular reference to malaria and hepatitis C, and discusses the desirability of iron supplementation of populations at risk of infection."
CD008122,0,15853923,0,Distinct interethnic differences in immunoglobulin G class/subclass and immunoglobulin M antibody responses to malaria antigens but not in immunoglobulin G responses to nonmalarial antigens in sympatric tribes living in West Africa.,"The well-established relative resistance to malaria observed in the Fulani as compared with other sympatric tribes in West Africa has been attributed to their higher levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to malarial antigens. In this study, we confirm and extend the previous findings by analyses of the levels of IgM, IgG and IgG subclasses of anti-malarial antibodies in asymptomatic individuals of different sympatric tribes in Burkina Faso (Fulani/Mossi) and Mali (Fulani/Dogon). The Fulani showed significantly higher median concentrations of anti-malarial IgG and IgM antibodies than the sympatric tribes at both locations. Although the overall subclass pattern of antibodies did not differ between the tribes, with IgG1 and IgG3 as dominant, the Fulani showed consistently significantly higher levels of these subclasses as compared with those of the non-Fulani individuals. No significant differences were seen in the levels of total IgG between the tribes, but the Fulani showed significantly higher levels of total IgM than their neighbours in both countries. While the antibody levels to some nonmalarial antigens showed the same pattern of differences seen for antibody levels to malaria antigens, no significant such differences were seen with antibodies to other nonmalarial antigens. In conclusion, our results show that the Fulani in two different countries show higher levels of anti-malarial antibodies than sympatric tribes, and this appears not to be a reflection of a general hyper-reactivity in the Fulani."
CD008122,0,15313128,0,Free-living amoebae as opportunistic and non-opportunistic pathogens of humans and animals.,"Knowledge that free-living amoebae are capable of causing human disease dates back some 50 years, prior to which time they were regarded as harmless soil organisms or, at most, commensals of mammals. First Naegleria fowleri, then Acanthamoeba spp. and Balamuthia mandrillaris, and finally Sappinia diploidea have been recognised as etiologic agents of encephalitis; Acanthamoeba spp. are also responsible for amoebic keratitis. Some of the infections are opportunistic, occurring mainly in immunocompromised hosts (Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia encephalitides), while others are non-opportunistic (Acanthamoeba keratitis, Naegleria meningoencephalitis, and cases of Balamuthia encephalitis occurring in immunocompetent humans). The amoebae have a cosmopolitan distribution in soil and water, providing multiple opportunities for contacts with humans and animals, as evidenced by antibody titers in surveyed human populations. Although, the numbers of infections caused by these amoebae are low in comparison to other protozoal parasitoses (trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, malaria, etc.), the difficulty in diagnosing them, the challenge of finding optimal antimicrobial treatments and the morbidity and relatively high mortality associated with, in particular, the encephalitides have been a cause for concern for clinical and laboratory personnel and parasitologists. This review presents information about the individual amoebae: their morphologies and life-cycles, laboratory cultivation, ecology, epidemiology, nature of the infections and appropriate antimicrobial therapies, the immune response, and molecular diagnostic procedures that have been developed for identification of the amoebae in the environment and in clinical specimens."
CD008122,0,12674501,0,MSP-1 malaria pseudopeptide analogs: biological and immunological significance and three-dimensional structure.,"Merozoite Surface Protein-1 (MSP-1) has been considered as a malaria vaccine candidate. It is processed during the Plasmodium falciparum invasion process of red blood cells (RBCs). A conserved MSP-1 C-terminal peptide was identified as a high-activity erythrocyte-binding peptide (HAEBP) termed 1585. Since conserved HAEBPs are neither antigenic nor immunogenic we decided to assess the significance of a single peptide bond replacement in 1585. Thus, two pseudopeptides were obtained by introducing a Y[CH2-NH] reduced amide isoster into the 1585 critical binding motif. The pseudopeptides bound to different HLA-DR alleles, suggesting that backbone modifications affect MHC-II binding patterns. Pseudopeptide-antibodies inhibit in vitro parasite RBC invasion by recognizing MSP-1. Each pseudopeptide-induced antibody shows distinct recognition patterns. 1H-NMR studies demonstrated that isoster bonds modulate the pseudopeptides' structure and thus their immunological properties, therefore representing a possible subunit malaria vaccine component."

CD008122,0,10991837,0,Hematin polymerization assay as a high-throughput screen for identification of new antimalarial pharmacophores.,"Hematin polymerization is a parasite-specific process that enables the detoxification of heme following its release in the lysosomal digestive vacuole during hemoglobin degradation, and represents both an essential and a unique pharmacological drug target. We have developed a high-throughput in vitro microassay of hematin polymerization based on the detection of (14)C-labeled hematin incorporated into polymeric hemozoin (malaria pigment). The assay uses 96-well filtration microplates and requires 12 h and a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter. The robustness of the assay allowed the rapid screening and evaluation of more than 100, 000 compounds. Random screening was complemented by the development of a pharmacophore hypothesis using the ""Catalyst"" program and a large amount of data available on the inhibitory activity of a large library of 4-aminoquinolines. Using these methods, we identified ""hit"" compounds belonging to several chemical structural classes that had potential antimalarial activity. Follow-up evaluation of the antimalarial activity of these compounds in culture and in the Plasmodium berghei murine model further identified compounds with actual antimalarial activity. Of particular interest was a triarylcarbinol (Ro 06-9075) and a related benzophenone (Ro 22-8014) that showed oral activity in the murine model. These compounds are chemically accessible and could form the basis of a new antimalarial medicinal chemistry program."
CD008122,0,18807374,0,Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in malaria.,"Malaria is an important treatable cause of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the tropics and in the returning traveller in the non-endemic areas. ARDS is an important complication in severe, complicated falciparum malaria and has been described in P. vivax and P. ovale malaria also. Malarial ALI/ARDS is more common in adults than in children. Pregnant women and non-immune individuals are more prone to develop this condition. Increased alveolar capillary permeability resulting in intravascular fluid loss into the lungs appears to be the key pathophysiologic mechanism. In malaria, ARDS can develop either at initial presentation or after initiation of treatment when the parasitaemia is falling and the patient is improving. Patients present with acute onset dysnoea that can rapidly progress to respiratory failure. The diagnosis of malaria is confirmed by slide microscopy supported by the use of rapid antigen tests. Patients with malarial ARDS should be managed in an intensive care unit. Careful attention must be paid to haemodynamic stabilisation and optimising fluid balance. Currently, specific treatment choices for malaria include parenteral artemisinins or intravenous quinine along with doxycycline. Respiratory failure requires endotracheal intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation. Co-existent bacterial sepsis is frequently present in patients with malarial ARDS eventhough an obvious focus may not be evident. Appropriate broad spectrum antibiotic therapy must be started when there is a clinical suspicion after procuring the microbiological specimens. ARDS in malaria is a disease with a high mortality. Early diagnosis, institution of specific antimalarial treatment and assisted ventilation can be life-saving."
CD008122,0,6340845,0,[Use of purified antigens in the serodiagnosis and epidemiologic studies of human malaria. Importance of the ELISA technic for determining specific IgG and IgM].,"A purified antigen was isolated from the red blood cells of Saimiri sciureus which was experimentally infected by Plasmodium falciparum. An enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) was carried out thanks to this antigen. The results obtained with the test were evaluated from two series of sera: one coming from an endemic area, the other taken out of it. The results were compared with those obtained with indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) which is considerated as reference test. There is a good correlation between the two tests when anti-IgG conjugate is used for ELISA but there is no correlation with anti-IgM conjugate. One of the advantages of the ELISA, is that it allows a separate evaluation of specific IgG and IgM. Consequently distinction between recent and past infection would be possible. This may be useful for estimating the efficiency of an antimalaric campaign."
CD008122,0,15793155,0,Pharmacokinetics of oral doxycycline during combination treatment of severe falciparum malaria.,The pharmacokinetics of oral doxycycline administered at 200 mg every 24 h were investigated in 17 patients recovering from severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The data suggest that the doses of doxycycline currently recommended (circa 3.5 mg/kg of body weight daily) may not be optimal.
CD008122,0,19530624,0,Diagnosis of clinical samples spotted on FTA cards using PCR-based methods.,"The broad clinical presentation of Leishmaniasis makes the diagnosis of current and past cases of this disease rather difficult. Differential diagnosis is important because diseases caused by other aetiologies and a clinical spectrum similar to that of leishmaniasis (e.g. leprosy, skin cancers and tuberculosis for CL; malaria and schistosomiasis for VL) are often present in endemic areas of endemicity. Presently, a variety of methods have been developed and tested to aid the identification and diagnosis of Leishmania. The advent of the PCR technology has opened new channels for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis in a variety of clinical materials. PCR is a simple, rapid procedure that has been adapted for diagnosis of leishmaniasis. A range of tools is currently available for the diagnosis and identification of leishmaniasis and Leishmania species, respectively. However, none of these diagnostic tools are examined and tested using samples spotted on FTA cards. Three different PCR-based approaches were examined including: kDNA minicircle, Leishmania 18S rRNA gene and PCR-RFLP of Intergenic region of ribosomal protein. PCR primers were designed that sit within the coding sequences of genes (relatively well conserved) but which amplify across the intervening intergenic sequence (relatively variable). These were used in PCR-RFLP on reference isolates of 10 of the most important Leishmania species: L. donovani, L. infantum, L. major & L. tropica. Digestion of PCR products with restriction enzymes produced species-specific restriction patterns allowed discrimination of reference isolates. The kDNA minicircle primers are highly sensitive in diagnosis of both bone marrow and skin smears from FTA cards. Leishmania 18S rRNA gene conserved region is sensitive in identification of bone marrow smear but less sensitive in diagnosing skin smears. The intergenic nested PCR-RFLP using P5 & P6 as well as P1 & P2 newly designed primers showed high level of reproducibility and sensitivity. Though, it was less sensitive than kDNA minicircle primers, but easily discriminated between Leishmania species."

CD008122,0,1975379,0,Prevalence of antibody to heterologous circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium vivax in Thailand.,"The distribution in Thailand of antibody to a recently discovered variant of circumsporozoite proteins of Plasmodium vivax was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA capture antigens were a synthetic peptide of the principal variant sequence ANGAGNQPG and a candidate P vivax vaccine that contained the predominant repeat sequence GDRAA/DGQPA. Serological evidence of recent inoculation with the variant was found throughout Thailand and in migrants from Cambodia, Malaysia, and Burma. IgG antibody to the two P vivax circumsporozoite proteins was detected in 217 of 804 test sera (27%). Within the regions studied the proportion of positive sera specific for the variant epitope ranged from 28% to 66%. A vaccine against the predominant repeat domain may rapidly select for the variant, which already appears to be widespread within Thailand."
CD008122,0,6340848,0,Development of malaria vaccines: memorandum from a USAID/WHO meeting.,"The fifth meeting of the Scientific Working Group on the Immunology of Malaria evaluated studies of the production and analysis of defined malarial antigens. Rapid progress has been made in the study of protective antigens on the surface of sporozoites and it is likely that a family of analogous polypeptides occurs in several species of Plasmodium. New assays have been developed for the detection of these antigens and for the detection of infected mosquitos. Exoerythrocytic stages of several parasite species can be cultivated in vitro, providing an assay system for antibody and allowing the characterization of exoerythrocytic stage antigens. Progress has also been made in the identification of species- and stage-specific antigens of the asexual blood stages of rodent, simian, and human malaria parasites. In some instances, protective immunity has been shown to be directed against polypeptides (with a high relative molecular mass) synthesized at a late stage of schizont development. Messenger RNA (mRNA) species from P. knowlesi and P. yoelii have been successfully translated in vitro to give polypeptides with a high relative molecular mass (M(r)). Monoclonal antibodies have been used to identify and to purify important parasite antigens and purified P. yoelii antigens induced protective immunity. Monoclonal antibodies reactive with merozoite surface antigens have been used, as well as S-antigens, to distinguish between different isolates of P. falciparum. Recombinant DNA technology is being applied to Plasmodium: differences were found between repetitive DNA sequences from the genome of two isolates of P. falciparum; the genes for ribosomal RNA of P. falciparum and P. yoelii, and sequences homologous to the actin gene were identified in fragments of Plasmodium DNA cloned in prokaryotic vectors; by means of hybrid selection, complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were used to purify mRNAs encoding proteins of P. knowlesi of up to 100 000 M(r)."
CD008122,0,1741811,0,Malaria in an urban emergency department: epidemiology and diagnostic features of 25 cases.,"This article presents a retrospective study of 25 patients diagnosed with malaria in an urban emergency department (ED) between June 1986 and June 1989. The mean annual case rate of malaria in this study group was more than three times the national rate. This may be ascribed to the notable ethnic diversity of the population. A history of travel to an area endemic for malaria was eventually elicited from all patients. The most common chief complaint was fever (56%) followed by abdominal pain (12%). Temperatures were elevated in 70% of the patients, with a mean temperature of 102.9 degrees F (39 degrees C). Gender was found to play a role in delaying diagnosis, with women accounting for 83% of a group of patients requiring multiple ED visits before diagnosis. The authors conclude that malaria must be considered when diagnosing patients in ethnically diverse populations. Gender may be associated with a delay in diagnosis. A careful travel history and a peripheral smear are aids in rapid diagnosis."

A total of 92 parasitologically proven patients were compared with cutaneous leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, malaria, onchocerciasis and tuberculosis patients, as well as with healthy endemic and non-endemic controls. Some VL patients were examined before and after chemotherapy. VL patients showed significantly higher IgG responses compared with all other groups (93.4% sensitivity, 93.7% specificity), and higher (but not significantly) IgM responses. All groups showed low IgA levels. All IgG subclasses, IgG1, 2, 3, and 4, showed higher levels in patients than all other groups, with IgG1 and IgG3 levels being significantly reduced following treatment. The rank order for specificity and sensitivity for IgG subclasses was IgG3 > IgG1 > IgG2 > IgG4."

CD008122,0,19146706,0,Swedish traveller with Plasmodium knowlesi malaria after visiting Malaysian Borneo.,"Plasmodium knowlesi is typically found in nature in macaques and has recently been recognized as the fifth species of Plasmodium causing malaria in human populations in south-east Asia. A case of knowlesi malaria is described in a Swedish man, who became ill after returning from a short visit to Malaysian Borneo in October 2006. His P. knowlesi infection was not detected using a rapid diagnostic test for malaria, but was confirmed by PCR and molecular characterization. He responded rapidly to treatment with mefloquine. Evaluation of rapid diagnostic kits with further samples from knowlesi malaria patients are necessary, since early identification and appropriate anti-malarial treatment of suspected cases are essential due to the rapid growth and potentially life-threatening nature of P. knowlesi. Physicians should be aware that knowlesi infection is an important differential diagnosis in febrile travellers, with a recent travel history to forested areas in south-east Asia, including short-term travellers who tested negative with rapid diagnostic tests."
CD008122,0,8830214,0,[Diagnosis of malaria in Africa using the Parasight F test].,The purpose of this study which was carried out in the Central African Republic between January and February 1994 was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Parasight F test in diagnosing malaria in the indigenous population. Comparison of test results in a series of 62 malaria suspects who had been residing in the country for more than 10 years and 67 malaria suspects who had been living abroad showed significant differences but the overall value of the test was satisfactory. The test was specific for Plasmodium falciparum. In-field trials showed that the test could be used effectively by paramedics and community health care workers. Basing the decision to perform antimalarial treatment in semi-immune subjects with suspected malarial solely on the results of the Parasight F test would have led to unwarranted non-treatment in 10% of cases. Presumptive treatment of malaria is justified. The Parasight F test allows identification of Plasmodium falciparum and adaptation of therapy if required by the spread of chemoresistance.
CD008122,0,15385477,0,Comparison of immunogenicities of recombinant Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 19- and 42-kiloDalton fragments expressed in Escherichia coli.,"The 42- and 19-kDa C-terminal fragments of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1(42) and MSP-1(19), respectively) are both promising blood-stage vaccine candidate antigens. At present, it is not clear which of the two antigens will be more suitable for inclusion in a cocktail malaria vaccine. In the present study, we expressed the two C-terminal fragments of Plasmodium vivax MSP-1 (PvMSP-1) in an Escherichia coli expression system and purified them by using a rapid two-step protocol. Both of the products were recognized by monoclonal antibodies against PvMSP-1 as well as by immune sera from several individuals exposed to P. vivax. We analyzed and compared the immunological responses to recombinant PvMSP-1(19) and PvMSP-1(42) in mice by using six different adjuvant formulations. Moderate to high antibody responses were observed with both of the antigens in different adjuvant formulations. Surprisingly, alum, which is generally considered to be a poor adjuvant for recombinant malaria antigens, was found to be as good an adjuvant as Montanide ISA 720, ASO2A, and other adjuvant formulations. Most adjuvant formulations induced high levels of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), followed by IgG3 and IgG2. Lymphocytes from animals in the PvMSP-1(42)- and PvMSP-1(19)-immunized groups showed proliferative responses upon stimulation with the respective antigens, and high levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and gamma interferon were detected in the culture supernatants. Immunodepletion studies with sera from mice immunized with these two antigens showed that while immunization with PvMSP-1(42) does produce a PvMSP-1(19)-specific response, a substantial portion is also focused on structures in PvMSP-1(42) not represented by the epidermal growth factor-like domains of PvMSP-1(19). These findings may have implications for the design of MSP-1-based vaccine constructs."
CD008122,0,16962547,0,Relationship between antipyretic effects and cytokine levels in uncomplicated falciparum malaria during different treatment regimes.,"We have previously shown that both chloroquine and paracetamol (acetaminophen) have antipyretic activity during treatment of acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children 1-4 years old. Here, we studied if this effect was accompanied by changes in plasma cytokine levels. The 104 children were treated with either chloroquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) alone, SP+chloroquine or SP+paracetamol for 4 days. Cytokine levels were determined days 0, 2 and 3, body temperature every sixth hour until 72h and parasitemia once daily for 4 days. At admission, body temperature correlated with levels of IL-10, IFN-gamma and IL-6, and parasitemia correlated with IL-10 and IL-6. Except for TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, where no significant effect was found, all cytokine levels (IL-10, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18 and IL-4) decreased up to day 2 (p<0.05). IL-6 levels continued to fall from days 2 to 3 (p<0.05), whereas increased levels were found for several cytokines (IL-12, IL-13, IL-18 and IL-1beta) (p<0.05). The antipyretic effects of chloroquine and paracetamol could not be related to any specific changes in the evaluated cytokine production or in Th1/Th2 or inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios. Alternative mechanisms for antipyretic effects and associations between fever and cytokine levels during uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria are therefore discussed."

After Rh, antibodies in the Kell, Duffy, and Kidd blood group systems were the next in clinically significant antibodies to be revealed. Much of what has been learned about these blood groups since the journal Immunohematology issued its first edition has to do with the proteins, the genes, and the molecular basis for the antigens.

CD008122,0,17720817,0,The M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.,"A member of the M18 family of aspartyl aminopeptidases is expressed by all intra-erythrocytic stages of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfM18AAP), with highest expression levels in rings. Functionally active recombinant enzyme, rPfM18AAP, and native enzyme in cytosolic extracts of malaria parasites are 560-kDa octomers that exhibit optimal activity at neutral pH and require the presence of metal ions to maintain enzymatic activity and stability. Like the human aspartyl aminopeptidase, the exopeptidase activity of PfM18AAP is exclusive to N-terminal acidic amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, making this enzyme of particular interest and suggesting that it may function alongside the malaria cytosolic neutral aminopeptidases in the release of amino acids from host hemoglobin-derived peptides. Whereas immunocytochemical studies using transgenic P. falciparum parasites show that PfM18AAP is expressed in the cytosol, immunoblotting experiments revealed that the enzyme is also trafficked out of the parasite into the surrounding parasitophorous vacuole. Antisense-mediated knockdown of PfM18AAP results in a lethal phenotype as a result of significant intracellular damage and validates this enzyme as a target at which novel antimalarial drugs could be directed. Novel phosphinic derivatives of aspartate and glutamate showed modest inhibition of rPfM18AAP but did not inhibit malaria growth in culture. However, we were able to draw valuable observations concerning the structure-activity relationship of these inhibitors that can be employed in future inhibitor optimization studies."
CD008122,0,18632918,0,Levels of soluble CD163 and severity of malaria in children in Ghana.,"CD163 is an acute-phase-regulated monocyte/macrophage membrane receptor expressed late in inflammation. It is involved in the haptoglobin-mediated removal of free hemoglobin from plasma, has been identified as a naturally soluble plasma glycoprotein with potential anti-inflammatory properties, and is possibly linked to an individual's haptoglobin phenotype. High levels of soluble CD163 (sCD163) in a malaria episode may therefore downregulate inflammation and curb disease severity. In order to verify this, the relationships between sCD163 levels, malaria severity, and selected inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and IL-10) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using plasma samples obtained from pediatric malaria patients with uncomplicated malaria (UM [n = 38]), cerebral malaria (CM [n = 52]), and severe malarial anemia (SA [n = 55]) during two consecutive malaria transmission seasons (2002 and 2003). Median sCD163 levels were higher in UM (11.9 microg/ml) patients than in SA (7.7 microg/ml; P = 0.010) and CM (8.0 microg/ml; P = 0.031) patients. Levels of sCD163 were also higher in all patient groups than in a group of 81 age-matched healthy controls. The higher sCD163/TNF-alpha ratio in UM patients, coupled with the fact that sCD163 levels correlated with TNF-alpha levels in UM patients but not in CM and SA patients, suggests inflammatory dysregulation in the complicated cases. The study showed that sCD163 levels are elevated during acute malaria. High sCD163 levels in UM patients may be due to the induction of higher-level anti-inflammatory responses, enabling them to avoid disease complications. It is also possible that UM patients simply lost their CD163 receptors from macrophages in inflammatory sites while complicated-malaria patients still had their receptors attached to activated macrophages, reflecting ongoing and higher-level inflammation associated with complicated malaria."

A total of 109 persons from 25 families were studied in five villages. Ninety-nine inhabitants (90.8%) had at least one previous episode of malaria. Serology showed 85.7% and 46.9% of positivity when P. falciparum antigens and P. vivax MSP-1, respectively, were used. Twenty blood samples were PCR positive for P. vivax (20.4%) and no P. falciparum infection was evidenced by this technique. No individual presenting positive PCR reaction had clinical malaria during the survey neither in the six months before nor after, confirming that they were cases of asymptomatic infection. Only one 12 year old girl presented a positive thick blood smear for P. vivax. This is the first description of asymptomatic Plasmodium infection in this area studied."
CD008122,0,11517439,0,Chloroquine-resistant malaria.,"The development of chloroquine as an antimalarial drug and the subsequent evolution of drug-resistant Plasmodium strains had major impacts on global public health in the 20th century. In P. falciparum, the cause of the most lethal human malaria, chloroquine resistance is linked to multiple mutations in PfCRT, a protein that likely functions as a transporter in the parasite's digestive vacuole membrane. Rapid diagnostic assays for PfCRT mutations are already employed as surveillance tools for drug resistance. Here, we review recent field studies that support the central role of PfCRT mutations in chloroquine resistance. These studies suggest chloroquine resistance arose in > or = 4 distinct geographic foci and substantiate an important role of immunity in the outcomes of resistant infections after chloroquine treatment. P. vivax, which also causes human malaria, appears to differ from P. falciparum in its mechanism of chloroquine resistance. Investigation of the resistance mechanisms and of the role of immunity in therapeutic outcomes will support new approaches to drugs that can take the place of chloroquine or augment its efficiency."
CD008122,0,18337332,0,Nonmalarial acute undifferentiated fever in a rural hospital in central India: diagnostic uncertainty and overtreatment with antimalarial agents.,"Nonmalarial acute undifferentiated fever (NMAUF) refers to a febrile illness with no indication of an organ-specific disease after diagnosis of malaria has been excluded. In developing countries, the empirical treatment of NMAUFs with antimalarial drugs continues even in the era of highly specific rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria. We carried out a retrospective review of patients with fever admitted to a rural teaching hospital in central India. We categorized patients with NMAUF into different clinical syndromes and determined their demographic profile, inhospital course, and the pattern of antimalarial use. The study sample included 1,197 adult patients who were investigated for malaria; 1,053 (88%) of them had NMAUF, and use of further diagnostics in this group was limited. Despite one or more negative tests for malaria, many patients (39.9%, 95% CI 37.0-43.3) received antimalarial drugs. These results suggest a need for guidelines and training to improve empirical treatment of NMAUF."
CD008122,0,15611270,0,Differential immunogenicity of various heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens using DNA and viral vectors in healthy volunteers.,"Heterologous prime-boost vaccination has been shown to be an efficient way of inducing T cell responses in animals and in humans. We have used three vaccine vectors, naked DNA, modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), and attenuated fowlpox strain, FP9, for prime-boost vaccination approaches against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in humans. In this study, we characterize, using two types of ELISPOT assays and FACS analysis, cell-mediated immune responses induced by different prime-boost combinations where all vectors encode a multiepitope string fused to the pre-erythrocytic Ag thrombospondin-related adhesion protein. We show that these different vectors need to be used in a specific order for an optimal ex vivo IFN-gamma response. From the different combinations, DNA priming followed by MVA boosting and FP9 priming followed by MVA boosting were most immunogenic and in both cases the IFN-gamma response was of broad specificity and cross-reactive against two P. falciparum strains (3D7 and T9/96). Immunization with all three vectors showed no improvement over optimal two vector regimes. Strong ex vivo IFN-gamma responses peaked 1 wk after the booster dose, but cultured ELISPOT assays revealed longer-lasting T cell memory responses for at least 6 mo. In the DNA-primed vaccinees the IFN-gamma response was mainly due to CD4(+) T cells, whereas in the FP9-primed vaccinees it was mainly due to CD4-dependent CD8(+) T cells. This difference may be of importance for the protective efficacy of these vaccination approaches against various diseases."
CD008122,0,17624749,0,T cell memory in malaria.,"The observation that individuals living in malaria endemic areas fail to develop sterilizing immunity to malaria infection has led to the assumption that malaria-specific immune responses are sub-optimal. Recently, T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice specific for the sporozoite and blood stages of the malaria parasite have been developed. Studies using these models have found that, unexpectedly, T cell memory in malaria is not noticeably defective. However, if T cell memory is 'normal' why are people not better protected? We suggest this is because protective immunity and T cell memory do not always correlate; moreover, T cells alone may simply not be able to provide the type of antibody-mediated sterilizing immunity induced by traditional vaccines."
CD008122,0,19706920,0,Stability of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 responses to Plasmodium falciparum liver stage antigen 1 and thrombospondin-related adhesive protein immunodominant epitopes in a highland population from Western Kenya.,"Long-term planning to prevent malaria epidemics requires in-depth understanding of immunity to Plasmodium falciparum in areas of unstable transmission. Cytokine responses to immunodominant epitope peptides from liver stage antigen 1 (LSA-1) and thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) were evaluated over a nine-month interval in adults and children in Kenya from a malaria epidemic-prone highland area after several years of low transmission. The proportion and magnitude of interferon-gamma ELISPOT responses and the proportion of interleukin-10 responders to LSA-1 and TRAP peptides tended to be higher in adults than children. Frequencies of interferon-gamma responders to these peptides were similar at the two time points, but responses were not consistently generated by the same persons. These results suggest that T cell memory to pre-erythrocytic stage malaria antigens is maintained but may be unavailable for consistent detection in peripheral blood, and that these antigens induce both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in this population."
CD008122,0,14728621,0,Malaria transmission dynamics at a site in northern Ghana proposed for testing malaria vaccines.,"We studied the malaria transmission dynamics in Kassena Nankana district (KND), a site in northern Ghana proposed for testing malaria vaccines. Intensive mosquito sampling for 1 year using human landing catches in three micro-ecological sites (irrigated, lowland and rocky highland) yielded 18 228 mosquitoes. Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Anopheles funestus constituted 94.3% of the total collection with 76.8% captured from the irrigated communities. Other species collected but in relatively few numbers were Anopheles pharoensis (5.4%) and Anopheles rufipes (0.3%). Molecular analysis of 728 An. gambiae.s.l. identified Anopheles gambiae s.s. as the most dominant sibling species (97.7%) of the An. gambiae complex from the three ecological sites. Biting rates of the vectors (36.7 bites per man per night) were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the irrigated area than in the non-irrigated lowland (5.2) and rocky highlands (5.9). Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rates of 7.2% (295/4075) and 7.1% (269/3773) were estimated for An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus, respectively. Transmission was highly seasonal, and the heaviest transmission occurred from June to October. The intensity of transmission was higher for people in the irrigated communities than the non-irrigated ones. An overall annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of 418 infective bites was estimated in KND. There were micro-ecological variations in the EIRs, with values of 228 infective bites in the rocky highlands, 360 in the lowlands and 630 in the irrigated area. Approximately 60% of malaria transmission in KND occurred indoors during the second half of the night, peaking at daybreak between 04.00 and 06.00 hours. Vaccine trials could be conducted in this district, with timing dependent on the seasonal patterns and intensity of transmission taking into consideration the micro-geographical differences and vaccine trial objectives."
CD008122,0,10583904,0,Where health care has no access: the nomadic populations of sub-Saharan Africa.,"Nomadic and seminomadic pastoralists make optimal use of scarce water and pasture in the arid regions south of the Sahara desert, spreading from Mauretania in the west to Somalia in East Africa. We attempted to summarize the fragmentary evidence from the literature on the health status of these populations and to assess the best ways to provide them with modern health care. Infant mortality is higher among nomadic than among neighbouring settled populations, but childhood malnutrition is less frequent. Nomads often avoid exposure to infectious agents by moving away from epidemics such as measles. Trachoma is highly prevalent due to flies attracted by cattle. The high prevalence of tuberculosis is ascribed to the presence of cattle, crowded sleeping quarters and lack of health care; treatment compliance is generally poor. Guinea worm disease is common due to unsafe water sources. Helminth infections are relatively rare as people leave their waste behind when they move. Malaria is usually epidemic, leading to high mortality. Sexually transmitted diseases spread easily due to lack of treatment. Leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis are encountered; brucellosis occurs but most often goes undetected. Drought forces nomads to concentrate near water sources or even into relief camps, with often disastrous consequences for their health. Existing health care systems are in the hands of settled populations and rarely have access to nomads due to cultural, political and economic obstacles. A primary health care system based on nomadic community health workers is outlined and an example of a successful tuberculosis control project is described. Nomadic populations are open to modern health care on the condition that this is not an instrument to control them but something they can control themselves."

CD008122,0,11948870,0,Exploiting conformationally constrained peptidomimetics and an efficient human-compatible delivery system in synthetic vaccine design.,"Peptide and protein mimetics are potentially of great value in synthetic vaccine design. The mimetics should function by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that recognize the intact parasite. Also the mimetics should be presented to the immune system in a way that leads to efficient antibody production. Here we investigate the application of cyclic peptidomimetics presented on immunopotentiating reconstituted influenza virosomes (IRIVs), a form of antigen delivery that is licensed already for human clinical use, in synthetic vaccine design. We focus on the central (NPNA)(n) repeat region of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum as a model system. Cyclic peptidomimetics of the NPNA repeats were incorporated into both an IRIV and (for comparison) a multiple-antigen peptide (MAP). Both IRIV and MAP delivery forms induced mimetic-specific humoral immune responses in mice, but only with the mimetic-IRIV preparations did a significant fraction of the elicited antibodies cross-react with sporozoites. The results demonstrate that IRIVs are a delivery system suitable for the efficient induction of antibody responses against conformational epitopes by use of cyclic template-bound peptidomimetics. Combined with combinatorial chemistry, this approach may have great potential for the rapid optimization of molecularly defined synthetic vaccine candidates against a wide variety of infectious agents."

CD008122,0,15872277,0,Real-time PCR for detection and identification of Plasmodium spp.,"Rapid and accurate detection of malaria parasites in blood is needed to institute proper therapy. We developed and used a real-time PCR assay to detect and distinguish four Plasmodium spp. that cause human disease by using a single amplification reaction and melting curve analysis. Consensus primers were used to amplify a species-specific region of the multicopy 18S rRNA gene, and SYBR Green was used for detection in a LightCycler instrument. Patient specimens infected at 0.01 to 0.02% parasitemia densities were detected, and analytical sensitivity was estimated to be 0.2 genome equivalent per reaction. Melting curve analysis based on nucleotide variations within the amplicons provided a basis for accurate differentiation of Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. For assay validation, 358 patient blood samples from the National University Hospital in Singapore and Evanston Northwestern Healthcare in Illinois were analyzed. Of 76 blinded patient samples with a microscopic diagnosis of P. falciparum, P. vivax, or P. ovale infection, 74 (97.4%) were detected by real-time PCR, including three specimens containing mixed P. falciparum-P. vivax infections. No Plasmodium DNA was amplified in any of the 82 specimens sent for malaria testing but that were microscopically negative for Plasmodium infection. In addition, 200 blood samples from patients whose blood was collected for reasons other than malaria testing were also determined to be negative by real-time PCR. Real-time PCR with melting curve analysis could be a rapid and objective supplement to the examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears and may replace microscopy following further validation."
CD008122,0,14507328,0,Serum IgG3 to the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 is strongly associated with a reduced prospective risk of malaria.,"The merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) of Plasmodium falciparum is recognized by human antibodies elicited during natural infections, and may be a target of protective immunity. In this prospective study, serum IgG antibodies to MSP2 were determined in a cohort of 329 Gambian children immediately before the annual malaria transmission season, and the incidence of clinical malaria in the following 5 months was monitored. Three recombinant MSP2 antigens were used, representing each of the two major allelic serogroups and a conserved region. The prevalence of serum IgG to each antigen correlated positively with age and with the presence of parasitaemia at the time of sampling. These antibodies were associated with a reduced subsequent incidence of clinical malaria during the follow-up. This trend was seen for both IgG1 and IgG3, although the statistical significance was greater for IgG3, the most common subclass against MSP2. After adjusting for potentially confounding effects of age and pre-season parasitaemia, IgG3 reactivities against each of the major serogroups of MSP2 remained significantly associated with a lower prospective risk of clinical malaria. Individuals who had IgG3 reactivity to both of the MSP2 serogroup antigens had an even more significantly reduced risk. Importantly, this effect remained significant after adjusting for a simultaneous strong protective association of antibodies to another antigen (MSP1 block 2) which itself remained highly significant."

CD008122,0,10194746,0,"Identification of five species of the Anopheles dirus complex from Thailand, using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction.","The Anopheles dirus complex of mosquitoes contains some of the most important vectors of malaria in Southeast Asia. To distinguish five species of the complex that occur in Thailand, a method using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed. The method utilizes allele-specific amplification to detect fixed differences between the species in the DNA sequence of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2. Primers were designed to amplify fragments of diagnostic length from the DNA of the different species. The method was tested on 179 mosquitoes of the An. dirus complex from many parts of Thailand and shown to be effective. Every specimen was unambiguously identified as species A, B, C, D or F (i.e. An. dirus s.s. species B, C, D or An. nemophilous, respectively) by the PCR method, with confirmation of 58/61 identifications from polytene chromosome characteristics. For the other three specimens (3/44 from Kanchanaburi 5 locality), there was disagreement between the PCR and chromosomal methods of species identification (probably due to errors in the chromosomal identifications). Primers can be combined in a single PCR reaction providing a rapid, sensitive and straightforward method of species identification. Only small quantities of DNA are required, leaving most of the mosquito to be used for other analyses."
CD008122,0,8944275,0,Features of recrudescent chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections confer a survival advantage on parasites and have implications for disease control.,"This paper reports on the features of recrudescent infections of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CQRPf) malaria from a study in vivo of patients from a malaria endemic (n = 527) and non-endemic (n = 129) region of Sri Lanka where the incidence of RI resistance was 30% and 55%, respectively. In both groups of patients, the recrudescent infections which emerged after treatment of the primary infection with chloroquine (CQ) and primaquine had significantly lower peripheral parasitaemia (0.036% and 0.108% in endemic and non-endemic patients, respectively) compared to their primary infections (mean parasitaemia 0.13% and 0.49%; P = 0.021 and 0.002, respectively). The recrudescences of CQ resistant infections also gave rise to clinical disease of markedly reduced severity (average clinical scores of 10.1 and 8.2) compared to their primary infections (average clinical scores of 12.4 and 12.3; P = 0.003 and 0.001, respectively, in endemic and non-endemic patients). CQ resistant recrudescent infections therefore had a lower probability of being diagnosed and treated. In endemic patients, a higher proportion of CQRPf infections (57%) had gametocytaemia compared to the chloroquine sensitive ones (29%) (P = 0.014, chi 2 = 5.96) and were significantly more infective to mosquitoes (P = 0.047). these findings imply that, in areas where CQ resistance is prevalent, the continued use of the drug may confer a survival and propagation advantage on resistant parasites and favour the rapid expansion of their reservoir. In support of this, we also present epidemiological evidence showing that, in endemic areas, the proportion of P. falciparum patients carrying gametocytes has increased significantly since the emergence of chloroquine resistance. These findings are relevant to the management of drug resistance and malaria control in countries where P.falciparum is only partially resistant to CQ."
CD008122,0,19263088,0,Malaria morbidity and temperature variation in a low risk Kenyan district: a case of overdiagnosis?,"Diagnosis of malaria using only clinical means leads to overdiagnosis. This has implications due to safety concerns and the recent introduction of more expensive drugs. Temperature is a major climatic factor influencing the transmission dynamics of malaria. This study looked at trends in malaria morbidity in the low risk Kenyan district of Nyandarua, coupled with data on temperature and precipitation for the years 2003-2006. July had the highest number of cases (12.2% of all cases) followed by August (10.2% of all cases). July and August also had the lowest mean maximum temperatures, 20.1 and 20.2 degrees C respectively. April, July and August had the highest rainfall, with daily means of 4.0, 4.3 and 4.9 mm, respectively. Observation showed that the coldest months experienced the highest number of cases of malaria. Despite the high rainfall, transmission of malaria tends to be limited by low temperatures due to the long duration required for sporogony, with fewer vectors surviving. These cold months also tend to have the highest number of cases of respiratory infections. There is a possibility that some of these were misdiagnosed as malaria based on the fact that only a small proportion of malaria cases were diagnosed using microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. We conclude that overdiagnosis may be prevalent in this district and there may be a need to design an intervention to minimise it."
CD008122,0,1978068,0,"TNF concentration in fatal cerebral, non-fatal cerebral, and uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.","Plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) were significantly higher in 178 Gambian children with uncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum than in 178 children with other illnesses. 110 children with cerebral malaria were studied shortly after admission to hospital; 28 subsequently died. Compared with the children with uncomplicated malaria, mean plasma TNF levels were twice as high in cerebral malaria survivors and ten times as high in the fatal cases. Although high TNF levels were associated with high parasitaemia and with hypoglycaemia, they predicted fatal outcome in cerebral malaria independently of parasitaemia and glucose concentrations. Concentrations of interleukin-1 alpha, but not interferon gamma, were also related to the severity of malaria. We conclude that increased TNF production is a normal host response to P falciparum infection, but that excessive levels of production may predispose to cerebral malaria and a fatal outcome."
CD008122,0,17034691,0,Evaluation of tests for serological diagnosis of scrub typhus.,"Two specific serological tests, a Dot enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and an immunoglobulin (Ig)M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the 56 kDa antigen and the Weil-Felix test were evaluated for diagnosis of scrub typhus. Sensitivity of 100, 86.5 and 43.5% were observed with Dot EIA, IgM ELISA and Weil-Felix test, respectively. False-positive reactions were observed in patients with falciparum malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, S. viridans septicemia and typhoid fever using Dot EIA and IgM ELISA. Therefore, although Dot EIA and IgM ELISA are useful in the serodiagnosis of scrub typhus, efforts should be made to rule out other febrile illnesses."
CD008122,0,10674672,0,Factors influencing resistance to reinfection with Plasmodium falciparum.,"A treatment-reinfection study design was used to investigate the relationships between host immunologic and/or genetic factors and resistance to reinfection with Plasmodium falciparum. Sixty-one children in Gabon were enrolled in a cross-sectional study to measure the prevalence of each human plasmodial species. All were given amodiaquine for radical cure of parasites, and 40 were subsequently followed-up for 30 weeks. Successive blood smears were examined to measure the delay of reappearance in blood of asexual stages of P. falciparum parasites. Presence of infection during the cross-sectional survey was associated with male sex, non-deficient glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, plasma interleukin-10 level, and anti-LSA-Rep antibody concentration. Resistance to reinfection was related to the presence of anti-LSA-J antibodies, and the absence of anti-LSA-Rep antibodies. Moreover, P. malariae-infected subjects were usually co-infected with P. falciparum, and were also more rapidly reinfected with P. falciparum after treatment, compared with those without P. malariae infection."
CD008122,0,2469729,0,Human T cell recognition of polymorphic epitopes from malaria circumsporozoite protein.,"Lymphocytes obtained from forty individuals living in a malaria endemic area of West Africa were tested for in vitro proliferative responses to peptides representing variant regions of the immunodominant T cell domain of the circumsporozoite protein (amino acids 326 to 345, referred to as Th2R, and 361 to 380, referred to as Th3R) from three distinct strains of Plasmodium falciparum. A total of 83% of the individuals responded to at least one of the six peptides tested, confirming that these epitopes are immunodominant. A much greater number of individuals than expected by chance (32% of the responders to Th2R and 27% of the responders to Th3R) reacted to all three of the variant peptides for that epitope, indicating interdependency of the T cell responses, suggestive of cross-reactivity. Nevertheless, some subjects' T cells were clearly able to distinguish each variant peptide from the others. Using EBV transformed B cells, lymphocytes from 10 of the individuals were HLA typed. In this small group, HLA DRw13 was associated with a positive response to any of the peptides, whereas there was a negative association between DQw3 and response to any of the peptides. These results, although limited by the small sample size, suggest that recognition of T epitopes may be Ir gene linked. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to broaden the immunogenicity of an anti-sporozoite malaria vaccine."
CD008122,0,18983278,1,Evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test specific for Plasmodium vivax.,"Plasmodium vivax is the only human malaria indigenous to the Republic of Korea (ROK). A rapid and sensitive diagnostic test (RDT) that detects P. vivax is appropriate for evaluating suspected malaria patients with no travel history abroad. The RDTs, SD Malaria Antigen P.v (SD diagnostic, Kyonggi, ROK) specific for P. vivax and the well documented OptiMAL (DiaMed, Cressier, Switzerland) were compared among 282 volunteers for specificity and sensitivity of P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria infections against Giemsa-stained blood smears read by an experienced microscopist. A total of 137 volunteers were diagnosed with P. vivax, 45 cases (returned travellers from overseas) were diagnosed with P. falciparum and 100 healthy volunteers were diagnosed as negative for malaria. Correspondingly, the SD Malaria Antigen P.v test identified P. vivax infections in 128/137 malaria patients (93.4%) and 0/100 (0%) healthy volunteers. Three patients identified with P. falciparum also were interpreted as P. vivax by the SD Malaria Antigen P.v test; however, these patients were later confirmed as mixed infections of P. vivax and P. falciparum by polymerase chain reaction. OptiMAL interpreted the three mixed infections only as P. falciparum and detected 130/137 (94.9%) patients with P. vivax. The sensitivity of the SD Malaria Antigen P.v test decreased from 100% (>5000 parasite/microl) to 81.3% (1-100 parasites/microl) as parasitaemia levels declined. For the regions where P. vivax is the primary malaria parasite, the SD P. vivax-specific rapid diagnostic test may be useful for screening suspected malaria patients when sufficient material and human resources (e.g. trained microscopists) are unavailable for malaria diagnosis."

CD008122,0,9815250,0,Effects of viral hemorrhagic fever inactivation methods on the performance of rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum.,"Blood samples from patients with viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) pose a serious risk to laboratory workers. Current contingency plans for VHF samples recommend the use of heat, gamma-irradiation, or Triton X-100 to inactivate samples before handling. Malaria is the most important alternative diagnosis to be excluded in cases of suspected VHF. Interpretation of malaria smears using samples inactivated with these methods is problematic because morphology is altered. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of different inactivation methods on the performance of rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum. Triton X-100 and gamma-irradiation of samples preserved detection. The impact of Triton X-100 inactivation was also ""blindly"" evaluated using 100 blood samples from febrile travelers. Triton X-100 inactivation of samples did not significantly affect the performance of these tests. This may represent a useful strategy for excluding the diagnosis of falciparum malaria in cases of suspected VHF."

CD008122,0,10950798,0,Immunity to placental malaria. II. Placental antigen-specific cytokine responses are impaired in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.,"An association was demonstrated recently between elevated in vitro production of interferon (IFN)-gamma by intervillous blood mononuclear cells (IVBMCs) and protection against placental malaria (PM). Because human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women have increased susceptibility to PM, loss of the IFN-gamma response in these women may impair their ability to control PM. Measurement of cytokines in culture supernatants by ELISA revealed that IFN-gamma responses by HIV-positive IVBMCs were impaired, especially after malarial antigen stimulation. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 responses also were reduced in HIV-positive persons, the latter more so in HIV-positive, PM-positive persons. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor-alpha production generally was enhanced in PM-positive and HIV-positive persons. Overall, cytokine production was reduced in HIV-positive persons with CD4 T cell counts <500/microL, particularly in response to malarial antigen. Thus, HIV-mediated cytokine dysregulation and impairment of the protective IFN-gamma response may contribute to the increased susceptibility of HIV-positive pregnant women to malaria."
CD008122,0,9683894,0,A review of practical techniques for the diagnosis of malaria.,"Malaria is a global health problem, responsible for nearly 3 million deaths each year, and on the increase worldwide. Improvements in malaria diagnostics should facilitate the identification of individuals infected with the malarial parasites and the treatment of such cases with appropriate drugs. Both traditional and contemporary methods for malaria diagnosis are the subjects of the present review. Traditional diagnosis, based on the examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears under a microscope, is inappropriate for many areas because there are insufficient microscopes and/or trained microscopists to read and interpret the slides. Such traditional methods are discussed in the context of parasite quantification. Newer, more advanced malaria diagnostics are now available and the relative merits of methods based on fluorescent microscopy or the detection of nucleic acid (including PCR) are described, including comparisons of costs. Fluorescent microscopy and nucleic-acid techniques both require skills and equipment which are not universally available in many malaria-endemic countries. Recently introduced diagnostic tests based on immuno-assays solve this problem since they are easy to run and interpret, and do not require complex equipment or technical support. They are also rapid (< 10 min/test), cost-effective and at least as sensitive as traditional microscopy."
CD008122,0,12749493,0,Effects of permethrin-treated bed nets on immunity to malaria in western Kenya II. Antibody responses in young children in an area of intense malaria transmission.,"As part of a large community-based trial on the impact of insecticide (permethrin)-treated bed nets (ITNs) on childhood morbidity and mortality in an area of intense perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya, we assessed the effects of ITNs on malaria-specific humoral responses in young children. The IgG responses to Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and liver stage antigen-1 (LSA-1) and the blood stage antigen merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1(19) kD) in children less than three years old were investigated during a series of cross-sectional surveys. At 14 and 22 months after the introduction of ITNs, the frequencies and levels of IgG to CSP and LSA-1 were significantly lower in children from ITN villages than in children from control villages (P < 0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of IgG to MSP-1 was significantly higher in children from ITN villages at 14 months (P = 0.0069), but not at 22 months. Our results show that decreased exposure by ITNs reduces IgG responses to pre-erythrocytic antigens, but there was no evidence that two years of ITN use compromises IgG responses to blood stage antigens in these young children in this malaria holoendemic area."

For each patient, a medical history was obtained and a complete physical examination was performed. Controls included 10 healthy volunteers and 50 patients with other diseases: malaria (10), leprosy (9), Chagas' disease (10), tuberculosis (10), and cutaneous leishmaniasis (11). The sensitivities of the rK39 antigen strip test and the ELISA were 90% and 89%, respectively, while the specificities were 100% and 98%, respectively. Our study confirms the accuracy of the rK39 antigen strip test in the diagnosis of VL in a high prevalence population."
CD008122,0,15710439,0,Antibody response of naturally infected individuals to recombinant Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1.,"In the present study, we evaluate the naturally acquired antibody response to the Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen 1 (PvAMA-1), a leading vaccine candidate against malaria. The gene encoding the PvAMA-1 ectodomain region (amino acids 43-487) was cloned by PCR using genomic DNA from a Brazilian individual with patent P. vivax infection. The predicted amino acid sequence displayed a high degree of identity (97.3%) with a previously published sequence from the P. vivax Salvador strain. A recombinant protein representing the PvAMA-1 ectodomain was expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded. By ELISA, this recombinant protein reacted with 85 and 48.5% of the IgG or IgM antibodies, respectively, from Brazilian individuals with patent P. vivax malaria. IgG1 was the predominant subclass of IgG. The frequency of response increased according to the number of malaria episodes, reaching 100% in individuals in their fourth malaria episode. The high degree of recognition of PvAMA-1 by human antibodies was confirmed using a second recombinant protein expressed in Pichia pastoris (PV66/AMA-1). The observation that recognition of the bacterial recombinant PvAMA-1 was only slightly lower than that of the highly immunogenic 19kDa C-terminal domain of the P. vivax Merozoite Surface Protein-1 was also important. DNA sequencing of the PvAMA-1 variable domain from 20 Brazilian isolates confirmed the limited polymorphism of PvAMA-1 suggested by serological analysis. In conclusion, we provide evidence that PvAMA-1 is highly immunogenic during natural infection in humans and displays limited polymorphism in Brazil. Based on these observations, we conclude that PvAMA-1 merits further immunological studies as a vaccine candidate against P. vivax malaria."

The problem of over-diagnosis of malaria, especially in low transmission settings including urban areas, is also receiving deserved attention. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the frequency of malaria among febrile outpatients seen in private and public primary care facilities of Antananarivo. The second aim was to determine, among the diagnosed malaria cases, the contribution of autochthonous urban malaria."
CD008122,0,16046450,0,Purification and characterization of a hemoglobin degrading aspartic protease from the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax.,"Aspartic proteases of human malarial parasites are thought to play key roles in essential pathways of merozoite release, invasion and host cell hemoglobin degradation during the intraerythrocytic stages of their life cycle. Therefore, we have purified and characterized Plasmodium vivax aspartic protease, to determine if this enzyme can be used as potential drug target/immunogen, and its inhibitors as potential antimalarial drug. The P. vivax aspartic protease has been purified by a combination of ion exchange and size exclusion chromatographies and HPLC. Its properties were examined in order to define a role in the hemoglobin degradation process. The purified enzyme migrated as a single band on native PAGE and SDS/PAGE with a molecular mass of 40 kDa. Gelatin zymogram analyses revealed a clear zone of proteolytic activity corresponding to the band obtained on native PAGE and SDS/PAGE. The enzyme has an optimal pH of 4.0 and exhibits its highest activity at 37 degrees C. The enzyme is inhibited by pepstatin, but not by other inhibitors including o-phenanthroline, EDTA, PMSF or E-64, supporting its designation as an aspartic protease; its IC50 value was found to be 3.0 microM. A Lineweaver Burk double reciprocal plot with pepstatin shows that the inhibition is competitive with respect to the substrate. Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions enhance the protease activity, whereas Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions were found to be inhibitory. The pivotal role of aspartic protease in initiating hemoglobin degradation in P. vivax malaria parasite is also demonstrated."
CD008122,0,14745545,0,Humoral responses against the C-terminal region of merozoite surface protein 1 can be remembered for more than 30 years in persons exposed to Plasmodium vivax.,"Most people infected with Plasmodium vivax malaria developed antibodies against the C-terminal region of P. vivax merozoite surface protein (PvMSP1c) and the antibodies are sustained for a period up to 10 months after anti-malarial treatment. The longer-term stability of the specific humoral response was evaluated indirectly by determining the antibody titers in the sera from healthy individuals who lived an area from which malaria had been eradicated (450 persons) and an area in which it had recurred (1,524 persons). There were considerable residual antibody responses to PvMSP1c in over 15% of sera from healthy individuals, but only those who had lived in the era when malaria was prevalent. This means that antibodies against PvMSP1c may persist for more than 30 years, the malaria-free duration. This long-term memory of humoral immunity supports the C-terminal region of merozoite surface protein 1 as an effective malaria vaccine, in addition to the neutralizing activity reported previously."

CD008122,0,8308272,0,The use of peptide ELISA in determining malaria endemicity.,"A study was undertaken with the objective to find out whether a reliable transmission index could be established by a simple peptide ELISA. This would be important to evaluate the success of the bioenvironmental malaria control programmes implemented in endemic areas like the Haldwani and Shankargarh districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. We have estimated antimalarial antibodies against three synthetic peptides derived from blood stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum and against P. falciparum crude antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in children and adults. We have found that while all the peptides react with serum antibodies, as does the whole crude blood stage antigen, a nonapeptide from RESA antigen gave the most uniform results. Our results suggest that synthetic peptides, which are easy to obtain and can be fully characterized, may offer a simple way to measure malaria endemicity."

A major experimental challenge is to identify the optimal components to be used in such a multivalent vaccine. Expression library immunization (ELI) is a method for screening genomes of a pathogen to identify novel combinations of vaccine sequences. Here we describe immune responses associated with, and the protective efficacy of, genomic Plasmodium chabaudi adami DS expression libraries constructed in VR1020 (secretory), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (chemoattractant), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (lymph node-targeting) DNA vaccine vectors. With splenocytes from vaccinated mice, specific T-cell responses, as well as gamma interferon and interleukin-4 production, were observed after stimulation with P. chabaudi adami-infected erythrocytes, demonstrating the specificity of genomic library vaccination for two of the three libraries constructed. Sera obtained from mice vaccinated with genomic libraries promoted the opsonization of P. chabaudi adami-infected erythrocytes by murine macrophages in vitro, further demonstrating the induction of malaria-specific immune responses following ELI. Over three vaccine trials using biolistic delivery of the three libraries, protection after lethal challenge with P. chabaudi adami DS ranged from 33 to 50%. These results show that protective epitopes or antigens are expressed within the libraries and that ELI induces responses specific to P. chabaudi adami malaria. This study further demonstrates that ELI is a suitable approach for screening the malaria genome to identify the components of multivalent vaccines."
CD008122,0,12646219,0,Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum proliferation in vitro by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against malarial topoisomerase II.,"The development of new effective antimalarial agents is urgently needed due to the ineffectiveness of current drug regimes on the most virulent human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) have shown promise as chemotherapeutic agents. Phosphorothioate AS ODNs against different regions of P. falciparum topoisomerase II gene were investigated. Chloroquine- and pyrimethamine-resistant P. falciparum K1 strain was exposed to phosphorothioate AS ODNs for 48 h and growth was determined by flow cytometric assay or by microscopic assay. Exogenous delivery of phosphorothioate AS ODNs between 0.01 and 0.5 microM significantly inhibited parasite growth compared with sense sequence controls suggesting sequence specific inhibition. This inhibition was shown to occur during maturation stages, with optimal inhibition being detected after 36 h. These results should prove useful in future designs of novel antimalarial agents."
CD008122,0,7707194,0,Patterns of antibody levels to the 96 tR recombinant protein of Plasmodium falciparum in children over a six-month period.,"Several Plasmodium falciparum asexual stage antigens have been reported as possible candidate antigens for vaccines against malaria. One such is the 96-kDa antigen. We used the 96 tR recombinant protein to determine the levels of antibodies to this protein over a 6-mo period in children 4 mo to 15 yr old, who make up the population at risk in Cameroon. The mean enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on 83 children at the start of the study in June was 0.270, with 13% of these children having ELISA values considered to be positive (> or = 0.36). In the follow-up study in early December, the mean ELISA was 0.320 with 20% of the children having positive values. In the period between June and December, 85% of the children who returned for follow-up had had 1 or more attacks of malaria. The mean ELISA values of this latter group had increased from 0.235 in June to 0.318 in December, with 6% of the children in June having positive values compared with 18% in December. These findings reinforce our evidence from a previous study that reactivity to the 96-kDa antigen is related to adequate exposure or repeated infection."

CD008122,0,9924957,0,Antibody response to the N and C-terminal regions of the Plasmodium vivax Merozoite Surface Protein 1 in individuals living in an area of exclusive transmission of P. vivax malaria in the north of Brazil.,"Recently, we found that a recombinant protein based on the 19 kDa C-terminal region of the Plasmodium vivax Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (PvMSP1(19)) was recognized by a large proportion of individuals naturally infected. The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of antibody to PvMSP1(19) in individuals from the village of Cotijuba, northern Brazil, where only P. vivax transmission occurs. Immuno-epidemiological studies on the prevalence of antibody to the C-terminus of PvMSP1 are of particular importance as this region of MSP1 is being intensively studied as a prime candidate for development of a vaccine against malaria. We evaluated the antibody response to PvMSP1(19), and compared it to the N-terminal region of PvMSP1 and to blood stage antigens. The total frequencies of individuals with IgG to blood stages, PvMSP1(19) or the N-terminal region of PvMSP1 were 76.6, 42.3 and 29.8%, respectively. The frequency of responders to PvMSP1(19) did not increase with age. However, the frequency of responders to this recombinant protein was significantly higher (77.4%) in individuals with a recent ( < 6 months) history of malaria, when compared to subjects whose last malaria attack occurred more than 6 months before (43.9%), or to individuals without a past history of symptomatic malaria (6.25%). These results confirm earlier studies by demonstrating that the PvMSP1(19) is highly immunogenic in individuals recently exposed to P. vivax malaria."
CD008122,0,9325291,0,"Isolation from phage display libraries of single chain variable fragment antibodies that recognize conformational epitopes in the malaria vaccine candidate, apical membrane antigen-1.",Phage display of single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies is a powerful tool for the selection of important and useful antibody specificities. We have constructed such a library from mice protected from malaria challenge by immunization with recombinant Plasmodium chabaudi DS apical membrane antigen (AMA-1). Panning on refolded AMA-1 enriched a population of scFvs which specifically bound the antigen. The single chain antibodies recognize conformational epitopes on AMA-1 from the P. chabaudi DS strain but not on AMA-1 of the 556KA strain of P. chabaudi. A subset of the antibody fragments recognized AMA-1 from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that at least four unique scFv genes were selected by the panning procedure. These scFv antibodies are valuable reagents for probing the structure and function of AMA-1 and will be used to test the feasibility of using recombinant antibodies in a passive immunization therapy against malaria.

In a phase 1 study of safety and immunogenicity, two recombinant proteins (Ro 46-2717, a circumsporozoite [CS] protein) construct with a molecular mass of 35 kD, and Ro 46-2924, a merozoite surface antigen [MSA-2] construct with a molecular mass of 25 kD) adsorbed onto alum were injected in two low (20 micrograms) or two high (100 micrograms) doses in the right and left deltoid muscles of 33 healthy Swiss volunteers; six other volunteers received a placebo (alum alone). Twenty-six participants reported 51 immunization-related adverse events, mainly pain at the injection site. Mean antibody titers to CS protein and MSA-2 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay peaked four weeks after the second immunization without evidence of boosting (i.e., sharp increase in titer). By that time, 56% and 31% of the vaccinees seroconverted to CS protein and MSA-2, respectively, with the increase in MSA-2 titer being weaker than that for the CS protein. After a third immunization, five vaccinees volunteered to be challenged by three or four infective bites of Anopheles stephensi. Prepatent and incubation periods in all five were comparable with unvaccinated historic controls challenged under similar conditions, and all had symptoms of clinical falciparum malaria. We conclude that the vaccine components were safe and immunogenic but there was no evidence that this immunization regimen with the CS protein plus MSA-2 component was able to prevent infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Whole blood samples (300 microl) collected in a 3 ml Wheaton glass sample vial were spiked with acetone (internal standard: 15 ng) followed by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture was heated in the sealed airtight sample vial in a water bath (96 Celsius; 5 min) to depolymerize paraldehyde to acetaldehyde. A 2 ml aliquot of the headspace was analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector using a stainless steel column (3 m x 4 mm i.d.) packed with 10% Carbowax 20 M/ 2% KOH on 80/100 Chromosorb WAW. Calibration curves were linear from 1.0-20 microg (r2>0.99). The limit of detection was 1.5 microg/ml, while relative mean recoveries at 2 and 18 microg were 105.6 +/- 8.4 and 101.2 +/- 5.9%, respectively (n = 10 for each level). Intra- and inter-assay relative standard deviations at 2, 10 and 18 microg were <15%.

CD008122,0,15520249,0,Evidence for the involvement of VAR2CSA in pregnancy-associated malaria.,"In Plasmodium falciparum-endemic areas, pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is an important health problem. The condition is precipitated by accumulation of parasite-infected erythrocytes (IEs) in the placenta, and this process is mediated by parasite-encoded variant surface antigens (VSA) binding to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). Parasites causing PAM express unique VSA types, VSAPAM, which can be serologically classified as sex specific and parity dependent. It is sex specific because men from malaria-endemic areas do not develop VSAPAM antibodies; it is parity dependent because women acquire anti-VSAPAM immunoglobulin (Ig) G as a function of parity. Previously, it was shown that transcription of var2csa is up-regulated in placental parasites and parasites selected for CSA binding. Here, we show the following: (a) that VAR2CSA is expressed on the surface of CSA-selected IEs; (b) that VAR2CSA is recognized by endemic plasma in a sex-specific and parity-dependent manner; (c) that high anti-VAR2CSA IgG levels can be found in pregnant women from both West and East Africa; and (d) that women with high plasma levels of anti-VAR2CSA IgG give birth to markedly heavier babies and have a much lower risk of delivering low birth weight children than women with low levels."
CD008122,0,12761094,0,Optimal tumor necrosis factor induction by Plasmodium falciparum requires the highly localized release of parasite products.,"Overproduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been linked with the pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Here, we examined why the high levels of TNF-inducing activity associated with P. falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes (PE) appear to be lost after cell lysis. Static coculture of PE and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), with or without separation by porous membranes, demonstrated that rupture of live PE in the presence of responder cells was required for optimal TNF induction. Although the insoluble fraction of lysed PE was found to partially inhibit TNF responses, supernatants prepared from large numbers of lysed PE still contained only low levels of TNF-inducing activity, which showed no evidence of instability. A dramatic reduction in TNF levels resulted when noncytoadherent PE lines were maintained under low-cell-proximity conditions by suspension coculture. This reduction was much less marked with PE capable of adhering to PBMC, despite the fact that cytoadherent and noncytoadherent parasite lines induced comparable levels of TNF in high-cell-proximity, static coculture. These results suggest that rupture of PE in a highly localized setting, facilitated by either static coculture or the more biologically relevant phenomenon of cytoadherence to PBMC, can result in considerable enhancement of the P. falciparum-induced TNF response."

CD008122,0,15500923,0,"Structural analogs of sialic acid interfere with the binding of erythrocyte binding antigen-175 to glycophorin A, an interaction crucial for erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum.","Plasmodium falciparum causes the most virulent form of malaria and remains a major worldwide health problem. The erythrocytic development of P. falciparum relies on parasite invasion of host erythrocytes, a process mediated in part by the interaction of erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA-175) with the erythrocyte receptor glycophorin A (GA). The binding domain of EBA-175 that interacts with glycophorin A is a approximately 330 residues module called F2. Several studies have shown that F2 recognizes both sialic acids and the protein backbone on glycophorin A. Here, we have developed ELISA-based quantitative F2-GA binding assays. We also performed a series of competitive inhibition assays to block the F2-GA interaction using a variety of sialic acid analogs. Our data show that both 2,3-didehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetyl neuraminic acid (DANA) and 3'-N-acetyl neuraminyl-N-acetyl lactosamine are excellent inhibitors of the F2-GA interaction. Moderate levels of inhibition were also observed with monomers or oligomers of N-acetyl neuraminic acid (sialic acid). Furthermore, we show that DANA is able to significantly inhibit the invasion of erythrocytes by P. falciparum. Together, our ELISA-based binding assays and in vitro inhibition of erythrocyte invasion data suggest that small variations in the structures of DANA and related inhibitors can result in even more potent invasion inhibitory activities. Our studies provide a platform for the development of high potency inhibitors of the F2-GA interaction using high throughput drug discovery technologies. Such compounds may form part of inhibitor cocktails, which aim to block invasion of erythrocytes by P. falciparum."

Assay was performed in 92 blood samples obtained from 53 falciparum malaria patients, representing 23 fever cases (malaria negative) and 16 healthy individuals. A simple indirect ELISA was done using Plasmodium falciparum lysate and MSP1(19) peptide as antigens. Total IgG and IgM contents were also estimated in individual sera and filter paper eluate by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID). Assay results of both serum and filter paper eluates were compared. The sensitivity and specificity of the assays for IgG measurement were comparable between serum and filter paper eluates (P < 0.001), whereas, in case of IgM, detection level was poor in filter paper eluates as observed by ELISA and SRID. The filter paper eluates may serve the purpose of antigen-specific IgG detection in seroepidemiological surveys."
CD008122,0,12076769,0,Amino terminus of Plasmodium falciparum acidic basic repeat antigen interacts with the erythrocyte membrane through band 3 protein.,"The acidic basic repeat antigen (ABRA) of Plasmodium falciparum is localised in the parasitophorous vacuole, and associates with the merozoite surface at the time of schizont rupture. By virtue of its protease-like activity, it is implicated in the process of merozoite invasion and schizont rupture, and therefore, possibly interacts with erythrocyte membrane proteins to execute its function during these events. In this study, using Escherichia coli expressed recombinant fragments of ABRA, we have demonstrated that ABRA interacts with red blood cells through its N-terminus. Out of the four human erythrocyte proteins tested, namely, band 3, glycophorin A and B and spectrin, ABRA showed dose-dependent and saturable binding with the band 3 protein. This binding was lost on chymotrypsin treatment of erythrocytes or their membrane extract. Studies with the deletion constructs of the N-terminus revealed that the binding domain lies in the cysteine-rich N-proximal region of ABRA. In addition to the recombinant fragments, native ABRA derived from the P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes also showed binding to band 3 protein. Sequencing of the cysteine-rich 528 bp region, amplified from fifteen field isolates of P. falciparum, showed that not only the five cysteines of mature ABRA but also the whole sequence is fully conserved, even at the nucleotide level. This sequence conservation of the N-terminus and its role in RBC binding suggests that this region may be crucial for any putative function of ABRA, therefore emphasising its importance as a vaccine/drug target."

Interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-13, and interferon-gamma were selected as lymphokine mRNAs of interest, since expression of these cytokines helps define the type of T helper lymphocyte response (i.e., TH1 versus TH2). Because sequences for these lymphokine genes were not available for the owl monkey, multiple PCR primers for each lymphokine gene were designed based on published human sequences. Various PCR primer pairs were then used in the RT-PCR to determine the conditions for optimal amplification of each owl monkey cytokine mRNA. In addition, each PCR primer pair was compared for the ability to amplify lymphokine mRNAs from other primate species, including African green (Cercopithecus aethiops), squirrel (Saimiri sciureus), and rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys. The specificity and sensitivity of optimal primer pair was also demonstrated by amplification of as little as 10 fg of each lymphokine gene in a background of 300 ng of irrelevant cDNA. Finally, partial sequences of owl monkey coding regions for IL-2, IL-13, and interferon-gamma were determined and compared for homology with their human counterparts. Together, these studies define specific and sensitive conditions for detection of lymphokine mRNA expression in the owl monkey and provide partial sequence information of the coding region for these lymphokines. This investigation should provide molecular probes to investigate the immune response against malaria and the effectiveness of malaria vaccines in the owl monkey that models this human disease."

CD008122,0,2202098,0,Antibodies to the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen and the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum in a rural community from Burkina Faso.,"A population-based study in Burkina Faso was conducted to determine, under conditions of natural exposure to malaria parasites, the prevalence rate and seasonal variation of antibodies to the repeated amino acid sequences of the Plasmodium falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte antigen (RESA) and the circumsporozoite (CS) protein, and the relationship of the presence of malaria parasites in the blood with the level of these antibodies. A random sample of households was selected and visited twice during 1988, in April just before the rainy season and in September at the end of the rainy season. Serological testing included an immunofluorescent assay for total anti-blood stage antibodies; a modified immunofluorescent assay on glutaraldehyde-fixed parasitized erythrocytes to detect antibodies to RESA; and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using synthetic peptides representing repeat amino acid sequences of RESA [(EENV)5, (EENVEHDA)4, and (DDEHVEEPTVA)2] and CS protein [(PNAN5)]. In April, at the end of the dry season, 98% of the individuals had total P. falciparum antibodies, and 39% had anti-RESA antibodies. 32%, 82%, 80%, and 41% of the individuals had antibodies to the respective peptides. All prevalence rates increased with age. After the rains, in September, prevalence rates and levels of reactivity increased in each serological assay, except in the ELISA with (DDEHVEEPTVA)2. Presence of P. falciparum parasitaemia was inversely related to antibody response to the CS protein (PNAN)5 peptide but not to any other assay."
CD008122,0,6874816,0,Determination of chloroquine and its major metabolite in blood using perfluoroacylation followed by fused-silica capillary gas chromatography with nitrogen-sensitive detection.,"Tandem fused-silica capillary gas chromatographic methods for the determination of chloroquine and its major metabolite, desethylchloroquine, are described. Method A employs a single extraction step and internal standardization to permit rapid, precise analyses for chloroquine in whole blood. Method B, employing derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride, can then be applied to the extract to allow qualitative and quantitative confirmation of chloroquine and sensitive, precise quantification for desethylchloroquine. The detection limit for chloroquine in blood is 5 ng/ml by both methods; the limit for desethylchloroquine is 15 ng/ml. Excellent precision is achieved by the methodology, partly due to the use of separate internal standards for the two analytes, each internal standard being a close analogue of the corresponding analyte. Data are presented which demonstrate the increase over time of metabolite relative to unchanged chloroquine found in the blood of a volunteer undergoing a chemoprophylactic regimen of chloroquine."
CD008122,0,18554564,0,Natural infectivity of Anopheles species from the Pacific and Atlantic Regions of Colombia.,"Malaria is an important public health problem in Colombia. Among the major vectors in Colombia, Anopheles albimanus is recognized for its importance on the Pacific Coast where it is the predominant species; it is also found in the Atlantic Coast, although its vectorial role in this region is not clear. We examined the occurrence of An. albimanus in four localities of the Pacific and three of the Atlantic Coast. Morphological identification of problematic specimens was confirmed by a molecular assay. All identified mosquitoes at these sites, including An. albimanus, were also tested for malaria parasite infection. From 12,189 anophelines collected, 6370 were from the Pacific Coast, and corresponded to 99% An. albimanus, 0.8% Anopheles neivai, and three other species at <0.2%. From the Atlantic Coast we identified 5819 specimens with 61% An. albimanus, 36% Anopheles triannulatus s.l. and five other species at <2%. In both coasts, species present at lower percentages included several incriminated as vectors in neighboring countries. Six Pacific Coast specimens were infected with malaria parasites: four An. albimanus, two with Plasmodium vivax VK247, one with P. vivax VK210 and one with Plasmodium falciparum; two An. neivai with P. falciparum. Our data support the continued predominance of An. albimanus in the Pacific Coast, and demonstrate that this species is the most abundant in the Atlantic Coast as well."

Peak antibody responses were observed at week 12. At week 40, a greater than or equal to 4-fold increase in antibody titre to sporozoites in IFA, or to (NANP)50 in ELISA was still detectable in 6 of 12 (50%) volunteers in group 1 and in 16 of 25 (64%) in group 2. Peak antibody titres in IFA and ELISA decreased with a rate of 0.8% and 0.5% per week, respectively."
CD008122,0,15525224,0,Mass spectrometry for malaria diagnosis.,"A physical method currently being developed for malaria parasite detection and diagnosis in blood is reviewed in this article. The method - direct laser desorption mass spectrometry - is based on the detection of heme (iron protoporphyrin) as a unique qualitative and quantitative molecular biomarker for malaria. In infected erythrocytes, the parasite sequesters heme in a molecular crystal (hemozoin) - a volume of highly concentrated and purified biomarker molecules. Laser desorption mass spectrometry detects only heme from hemozoin in parasite-infected blood, and not heme that is bound to hemoglobin or other proteins in uninfected blood samples. The method requires only a drop of blood with minimal sample preparation. Laser desorption mass spectrometry may become a rapid and high-throughput tool for specific and sensitive pan-malaria detection at levels below 10 parasites/mul of blood."
CD008122,0,12093674,0,Diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using urine samples.,"A diagnostic method has been developed to detect anti-Leishmania donovani immunoglobulin G (IgG) in urine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In measuring anti-L. donovani IgG, IgA, and IgM in urine, the method performed best in the detection of IgG. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined with panels of urine samples from 62 visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients, 59 healthy controls from areas of endemicity, 53 healthy controls from areas of nonendemicity, 59 malaria patients, 13 tuberculosis patients, 23 cutaneous leishmaniasis patients, and 7 patients with other diseases. Using L. donovani promastigote crude antigen, the test had 93.5% sensitivity (58 positives of 62 VL patient samples) and 89.3% specificity (191 negatives of 214 non-VL patient samples). The ELISA with acetone-treated L. donovani promastigote antigen raised the sensitivity and specificity to 95.0 and 95.3%, respectively. Western blot analysis revealed that most of the samples that cross-reacted with crude antigen in ELISA did not recognize any antigenic component of L. donovani crude antigen. We also checked 40 serum samples from the same group of VL patients for anti-L. donovani IgG and got 90.0% sensitivity with both crude and acetone-treated antigens. As collection of urine is much easier than collection of serum, the detection of anti-L. donovani IgG in urine with acetone-treated antigen will be useful in epidemiological studies. It could be an adjunct of laboratory diagnosis."
CD008122,0,11209845,0,Usefulness of genus-specific PCR and Southern blot species-specific hybridization for the detection of imported malaria cases in Italy.,"A PCR method involving a genus-specific oligonucleotides set and Southern blot hybridization with four species-specific probes to P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale was evaluated for the detection of malaria parasites in blood samples from 101 patients with clinically suspect malaria infection imported to Italy. Plasmodium falciparum was the main species detected. As determined by microscopy, 53 (52.4%) patients had malaria and of these: 40 (75.5%) were infected with P. falciparum; 7 (13.2%) with P. vivax; 1 (1.9%) with P. ovale; 3 (5.7%) with P. malariae; 1 (1.9%) with P. vivax or P. ovale; and 1 (1.9%) with P. falciparum or P. vivax. Ninety-seven out 101 blood samples were submitted to ParaSight-F test which showed a sensitivity of 94.73%, and a specificity of 93.22%, as compared to microscopy. The PCR assay using the genus-specific oligonucleotide primer set (pg-PCR) was able to detect 53 (52.4%) infections and showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%, when compared to microscopy. The parasite species were identified by Southern blot hybridization using species-specific probes and 40 (75.5%) samples were P. falciparum positive, 5 (9.4%) P. vivax positive, 4 (7.5%) P. ovale positive, and 2 (3.8%) P. malariae positive. When the Southern blot results were compared to those of blood-film diagnosis, we observed some disagreement. In particular, compared to Southern blot, microscopy underestimated P. ovale infection; blood film analysis recognised only 1 P. ovale sample, whereas Southern blot recognised 4 P. ovale positive samples (by microscopy, 2 of these were detected as P. vivax, 1 as P. ovale or P. vivax, and the other as P. falciparum or P. vivax). Southern blot hybridization was unable to identify one P. falciparum and one P. vivax positive case detected by microscopy. We also plan to use a reference nested-PCR assay to clarify the disagreement observed between microscopy and Southern blot hybridization."
CD008122,0,7529944,0,A longitudinal study of seroreactivities to a major blood stage antigen (Pf155/RESA) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in an endemic area of Thailand.,"We have performed a longitudinal study of the formation of antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum in an area of Thailand where malaria transmission is moderate and seasonal. The study population comprised 118 subjects living in two villages 230 km southeast of Bangkok. All subjects included in this study were seropositive for antibodies to the blood stages of P. falciparum but only approximately 80% had antibodies to the blood stage antigen Pf155/RESA when assayed by erythrocyte membrane immunofluorescence (EMIF) or peptide ELISA during the period of maximal transmission. The reduced capacity to form these antibodies in a significant fraction of subjects living under comparable environmental and socio-economic conditions may reflect a genetic but antigen specific non-responsiveness. Both seropositivity and mean antibody titers to Pf155/RESA and its B-cell epitopes tended to be slightly higher during the rainy than during the dry season but the seasonal variations were slight and statistically not significant. Parasite rates were significantly higher in the rainy than in the dry season in both the EMIF positive and the EMIF negative groups. However, during the rainy season, the parasite rates in subjects with no or low titered antibodies to Pf155/RESA were significantly higher than those in subjects having such antibodies. The results suggest that antibodies to Pf155/RESA and some of its defined epitopes may be of importance for controlling parasitemias."

CD008122,0,2015702,0,Studies on the humoral immune response to a synthetic vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"A synthetic vaccine against the asexual blood stages of P. falciparum, the SPf 66 synthetic hybrid polymer, composed of peptides derived from three merozoite membrane proteins as well as one peptide from the sporozoite CS protein, has been developed by our group and tested in different protection assays in Aotus monkeys as well as in human volunteers. This study evaluates the humoral immune response induced by the SPf 66 protein vaccination in adult human volunteers from the Colombian Pacific coast as follows: determination of specific IgG antibody levels against SPf 66 by FAST-ELISA after each immunization; analysis of antibody reactivity with P. falciparum schizont lysates by immunoblots; and determination of the in vitro parasite growth inhibition. A clear boosting effect, dependent on time and dose, was observed in the antibody production kinetics. These antibodies also specifically recognize three proteins of the P. falciparum schizont lysate corresponding to the molecular weights of the proteins from which the amino acid sequence was derived. These sera were also capable of markedly inhibiting in vitro parasite growth."
CD008122,0,12135261,0,Emergence of a new neotropical malaria vector facilitated by human migration and changes in land use.,"In a region of northeastern Amazonia, we find a species previously of minor importance, Anopheles marajoara, to be the principal malaria vector. In a total of five collections during 1996-97 in three replicated sites near the city of Macapá, Amapá state, this species occurs in much greater abundance compared with the presumed vector Anopheles darlingi. Also, a significantly higher proportion of An. marajoara is infected with malaria parasites, determined by the ELISA technique. This appears to be the result of increased abundance of An. marajoara due to alterations in land use, invasion of its primary breeding sites by human immigrants, and its anthropophilic behavior. This discovery highlights one of the challenges of Neotropical malaria control, namely that the targeting of specific vectors may be complicated by a changing mosaic of different locally important vectors and their interactions with human populations."
CD008122,0,19185326,0,Straightforward and rapid determination of sulfadoxine and sulfamethoxazole in capillary blood on sampling paper with liquid chromatography and UV detection.,"A method for the determination of sulfadoxine and sulfamethoxazole in capillary blood on sampling paper has been developed and validated. The method is straightforward with minimal sample preparation, and is suitable for rural settings. Separation of sulfadoxine, sulfamethoxazole and internal standard was performed using a Purospher STAR RP-18 endcapped LC column (150x4.6mm) with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile:sodium acetate buffer pH 5.2, I=0.1 (1:2, v/v). For sulfadoxine, the within-day precision was 5.3% at 15micromol/l and 3.7% at 600micromol/l, while for sulfamethoxazole it was 5.7% at 15micromol/l and 3.8% at 600micromol/l. The lower limit of quantification was determined to 5micromol/l and precision was 5.5% and 5.0% for sulfadoxine and sulfamethoxazole, respectively."

CD008122,0,9431947,1,Evaluation of the OptiMAL test for rapid diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"The development of rapid and specific diagnostic tests to identify individuals infected with malaria is of paramount importance in efforts to control the severe public health impact of this disease. This study evaluated the ability of a newly developed rapid malaria diagnostic test, OptiMAL (Flow Inc., Portland, Oreg.), to detect Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria during an outbreak in Honduras. OptiMAL is a rapid (10-min) malaria detection test which utilizes a dipstick coated with monoclonal antibodies against the intracellular metabolic enzyme parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). Differentiation of malaria parasites is based on antigenic differences between the pLDH isoforms. Since pLDH is produced only by live Plasmodium parasites, this test has the ability to differentiate live from dead organisms. Results from the OptiMAL test were compared to those obtained by reading 100 fields of traditional Giemsa-stained thick-smear blood films. Whole-blood samples were obtained from 202 patients suspected of having malaria. A total of 96 samples (48%) were positive by blood films, while 91 (45%) were positive by the OptiMAL test. The blood films indicated that 82% (79 of 96) of the patients were positive for P. vivax and 18% (17 of 96) were infected with P. falciparum. The OptiMAL test showed that 81% (74 of 91) were positive for P. vivax and 19% (17 of 91) were positive for P. falciparum. These results demonstrated that the OptiMAL test had sensitivities of 94 and 88% and specificities of 100 and 99%, respectively, when compared to traditional blood films for the detection of P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria. Blood samples not identified by OptiMAL as malaria positive normally contained parasites at concentrations of less than 100/microl of blood. Samples found to contain P. falciparum were further tested by two other commercially available rapid malaria diagnostic tests, ParaSight-F (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) and ICT Malaria P.f. (ICT Diagnostics, Sydney, Australia), both of which detect only P. falciparum. Only 11 of the 17 (65%) P. falciparum-positive blood samples were identified by the ICT and ParaSight-F tests. Thus, OptiMAL correctly identified P. falciparum malaria parasites in patient blood samples more often than did the other two commercially available diagnostic tests and showed an excellent correlation with traditional blood films in the identification of both P. vivax malaria and P. falciparum malaria. We conclude that the OptiMAL test is an effective tool for the rapid diagnosis of malaria."
CD008122,0,15210830,0,Evidence that invasion-inhibitory antibodies specific for the 19-kDa fragment of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1 19) can play a protective role against blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum infection in individuals in a malaria endemic area of Africa.,"The C-terminal 19-kDa fragment of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1(19)) is a target of protective Abs against blood-stage infection and a leading candidate for inclusion in a human malaria vaccine. However, the precise role, relative importance, and mechanism of action of Abs that target this protein remain unclear. To examine the potential protective role of Abs to MSP-1(19) in individuals naturally exposed to malaria, we conducted a treatment time to infection study over a 10-wk period in 76 residents of a highland area of western Kenya during a malaria epidemic. These semi-immune individuals were not all equally susceptible to reinfection with P. falciparum following drug cure. Using a new neutralization assay based on transgenic P. falciparum expressing the P. chabaudi MSP-1(19) orthologue, individuals with high-level MSP-1(19)-specific invasion-inhibitory Abs (>75th percentile) had a 66% reduction in the risk of blood-stage infection relative to others in the population (95% confidence interval, 3-88%). In contrast, high levels of MSP-1(19) IgG or IgG subclass Abs measured by enzyme immunoassay with six different recombinant MSP-1(19) Ags did not correlate with protection from infection. IgG Abs measured by serology and functional invasion-inhibitory activity did not correlate with each other. These findings implicate an important protective role for MSP-1(19)-specific invasion inhibitory Abs in immunity to blood-stage P. falciparum infection, and suggest that the measurement of MSP-1(19) specific inhibitory Abs may serve as an accurate correlate of protection in clinical trials of MSP-1-based vaccines."
CD008122,0,2360971,0,Immune response in patients with amoebiasis: evaluation of IgG-subclasses.,"In order to evaluate the immune response with respect to IgG-subclasses (IgG1-IgG4) in patients with extraintestinal amoebiasis, an ELISA technique was established. It was the aim of this pilot study to quantify the IgG subclass response and to compare the resulting pattern with other systemic protozoal infections. Our results give evidence that IgG4 contributes to more than one third of the total immune response, followed by IgG2, IgG3 and IgG1. Regarding the IgG4 response in patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria or Chagas disease, IgG4 plays only a minor role in these systemic protozoal infections. The interpretation of a prognostic value of the high IgG4 titres in our patients is not possible at present. However, in patients with a prolonged clinical course of extraintestinal amoebiasis, extremely high IgG4 titres were observed."
CD008122,0,3051550,0,Immunity to malaria in young Gambian children after a two-year period of chemoprophylaxis.,"A cohort of 48 Gambian children was protected against malaria by fortnightly administration of Maloprim (pyrimethamine and dapsone) for 2 years between their 3 and 5 birthdays. A matched cohort of 47 children received placebo. During the year following the termination of prophylaxis there was no increase in the frequency of clinical attacks of malaria in the protected children compared with the control children. Antibody levels to circumsporozoite protein were measured by a radioimmunoassay and that to blood-stage antigens by a variety of techniques including an ELISA to whole blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum antigen, immunofluorescent assays (IFAT) to acetone fixed, glutaraldehyde fixed and unfixed parasites, a merozoite inhibition test and an opsonizing assay. Antibody levels were, in general, lower in protected than in control children and several differences between the two groups were statistically significant. When antibody levels were measured by ELISA and IFAT at the end of the following rainy season, when malaria transmission was intense, those in protected children had increased to comparable levels to those found in control children. Our findings suggest that chemoprophylaxis given for 2 years lowers malaria antibody levels but that it does not interfere with the development of protective immunity."
CD008122,0,7851007,0,Antibody and clinical responses in volunteers to immunization with malaria peptide-diptheria toxoid conjugates.,"Twenty residue peptides from the 185-200-kD and 45-kD merozoite surface antigens of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum were covalently linked to diphtheria toxoid as a carrier and used to immunize human volunteers with aluminium hydroxide as an adjuvant. Significant antibody levels were elicited by two boosting injections. The antibodies reacted with acetone-methanol fixed merozoite membranes in an immunofluorescence assay, but no inhibition of merozoite reinvasion could be detected in in vitro cultures containing the antibodies. Antibody levels against the immunizing peptides declined markedly within 77 days after the third injection. No hypersensitivity was observed against the peptides. However, the volunteers developed hypersensitivity against diphteria toxoid, and in particular a pronounced type III (Arthus) hypersensitivity after three injections with the toxoid. This effect might appear to limit the use of peptide-diphtheria toxoid conjugates for human immunization. Several biochemical, haematological and immunological tests done on the volunteers showed no other adverse effects from the immunizations."
CD008122,0,7682381,0,An improved microassay for Plasmodium falciparum cytoadherence using stable transformants of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing CD36 or intercellular adhesion molecule-1.,"Stable transformants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing high levels of human CD36 or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) have been produced as target cells for cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. An improved adherence microassay has been designed using small sample volumes and allowing convenient and reliable measurements on a large number of samples. The assay can be used both with purified proteins spotted on plastic and with the stably transformed CHO cell lines. The same assay plate can be evaluated either microscopically or by scintillation counting after use of 3H-hypoxanthine-labeled parasites. Using the microassay, functional expression of the transfected receptor molecules on CHO-CD36 and CHO-ICAM was confirmed using parasites with different cytoadherence phenotypes and cytoadherence inhibition experiments with a panel of anti-CD36 antibodies. The use of isolates from The Gambia confirmed the applicability of these assays for laboratory studies of these isolates."
CD008122,0,9754665,0,"Seasonal density, sporozoite rates and entomological inoculation rates of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus in a high-altitude sugarcane growing zone in Western Kenya.","An entomological study was conducted on vectors of malaria and their relative contribution to Plasmodium falciparum transmission in Mumias, a high-altitude site and large-scale sugarcane growing zone in Kakamega district, western Kenya. Anopheles gambiae s.l., the predominant vector species, represented 84% (n=2667) of the total Anopheles mosquitoes collected with An. funestus comprising only 16%. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified all 600 specimens of the An. gambiae complex tested as An. gambiae sensu stricto, an indication that it is the only sibling species represented in the high-altitude sites in western Kenya. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rates of 6.3% (133/2118) for An. gambiae s.l. and 9.5% (38/402) for An. funestus by ELISA were obtained in Mumias. None of 1600 mosquitoes tested for P. malariae sporozoites was positive. ELISA tests of mosquito blood meals indicated a high tendency of anthropophagy, a behaviour contributing significantly to malaria transmission by the vector species, with 95.9%, 4.86% and 0.2% having taken at least one blood meal on human, bovine and avian hosts, respectively Malaria transmission intensity was low as revealed by the low entomological inoculation rates (EIR) recorded. The EIR values for An. gambiae s.l. were 29.2 infective bites per person per year (ib/p/year) and 17.5 ib/p/year for An. funestus in Mumias. The highest inoculation rate for both vector species was 7.0 ib/p/month in July. Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate among asymptomatic children was 55.4% and 44% in the wet (July-September) and dry (December-February) seasons, respectively. These results indicate that malaria transmission intensity in the high-altitude site is low but perennial, with transmission being maintained by An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus."
CD008122,0,15034567,0,A CD4(+) T-cell immune response to a conserved epitope in the circumsporozoite protein correlates with protection from natural Plasmodium falciparum infection and disease.,"Many human T-cell responses specific for epitopes in Plasmodium falciparum have been described, but none has yet been shown to be predictive of protection against natural malaria infection. Here we report a peptide-specific T-cell assay that is strongly associated with protection of humans in The Gambia, West Africa, from both malaria infection and disease. The assay detects interferon-gamma-secreting CD4(+) T cells specific for a conserved sequence from the circumsporozoite protein, which binds to many human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR types. The correlation was observed using a cultured, rather than an ex vivo, ELISPOT assay that measures central memory-'type T cells rather than activated effector T cells. These findings provide direct evidence for a protective role for CD4(+) T cells in humans, and a precise target for the design of improved vaccines against P. falciparum."
CD008122,0,17113917,0,Development of diagnostic reagents: raising antibodies against synthetic peptides of PfHRP-2 and LDH using microsphere delivery.,"Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, including countries with mainly imported malaria. In developing nations, scarce resources lead to inadequate diagnostic procedures. Microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin films remains the current gold standard for diagnosis. Although it has good sensitivity and allows species identification, it is time consuming, requires microscopical expertise and maintenance of equipment. Antigen tests are promising tools for the diagnosis of malaria. Two such antigens are Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein (pfHRP-2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The present study was aimed to develop indigenous, rapid and sensitive immunodiagnostic method based on detection of PfHRP-2 and LDH antigen in the blood. Unique peptide sequences of PfHRP-2 (two regions) and LDH (three regions) antigen were synthesized by solid phase technique and purified to homogeneity. The antibodies raised against these sequences were raised in mice as well as rabbit using microspheres (PLGA) to generate high titre and affinity antibodies. The peptide-specific peak titres varied from 25,000 to 50,000 and affinity of the antibodies produced was found to be in order of 0.73-5.3 nM. The antibodies generated using microspheres were able to detect the PfHRP-2 and LDH antigen in the culture supernatant and parasitized RBC lysate of P. falciparum respectively by sandwich ELISA up to 0.002% parasitaemia level. The assay allowed the detection of parasite infections of 0.08-2.68% parasitaemia with a sensitivity of 100% in the whole blood of P. falciparum positive patients. No cross-reactivity was observed with P. vivax infected patients."
CD008122,0,10493050,0,Appraisal of the acridine orange method for rapid malaria diagnosis at three Tanzanian district hospitals.,"The need to have rapid and accurate confirmation of malaria parasitaemia prompted us to evaluate the direct Acridine Orange (AO) stain method in comparison to the traditional Giemsa Stain (GS) method in the detection of malaria parasites in patients with presumptive diagnosis of malaria. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the AO method as well as the durability of the fluorescence microscope. Out of 400 patients with presumptive diagnosis of malaria, 209 (52.3%) and 197 (49.3%) had malaria parasites as detected by GS and AO methods respectively, the difference being statistically insignificant. The sensitivity and specificity of AO method compared to the gold standard (GS) method were 94.1% and 100% respectively. At parasite count below 5,000 per microlitre of blood, the sensitivity of AO method decreased to 90.2% but the difference was not statistically significant. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 94.1% respectively at all levels of parasite count. The mean duration to get results of malaria parasite diagnosis by GS and AO methods were 35 and 5 minutes respectively. The limitation of the AO method was frequent blowing of the fluorescence microscope bulb. It is concluded that if the bulb system of the fluorescence microscope can be improved, the AO method could be included among other methods for the detection of malaria parasites in clinical settings."
CD008122,0,3535766,0,Characterisation of the host response to Plasmodium falciparum infection. I. Cerebral malaria.,"Cerebral malaria is a major form of complicated malaria consequent upon cerebral damage associated with endothelial cell necrosis. We have used assays of Plasmodium falciparum growth inhibition in vitro to study serum inhibitory factors in patients with cerebral malaria. Serum from children with cerebral malaria inhibited parasite growth in a non-synchronised 72-hour assay to a greater extent than did sera from immune adults or asymptomatic children (p less than 0.001). The high level of non-specific inhibition of parasite growth was particularly evident when sera were tested against three P. falciparum isolates, and contrasted with the inhibitory effect of sera from non-malaria febrile controls. In this study, serum from patients with cerebral malaria was more inhibitory than serum from the other groups (p less than 0.001) and its between-isolate variation, when tested against a panel of P. falciparum isolates in growth assays, was significantly less than that of the other groups tested (p less than 0.005). These results are consistent with the hypothesis of toxin-induced endothelial cell damage, with the sequence of pathogenic events involving host-derived serum factors capable of damaging P. falciparum."

CD008122,0,15728862,1,Usefulness of a rapid on-site Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis (Paracheck PF) in forest migrants and among the indigenous population at the site of their occupational activities in central India.,"Logistic, economic, and technical factors limit rapid access to microscopic confirmation of malaria in many tropical countries, including India. The occurrence of high-grade fever and three deaths during the hot summer months in some forest migrants created an emergency situation in Jabalpur in central India. A cheap and rapid malaria test, Paracheck Pf, was tested in this group of migrants in parallel with microscopy. The indigenous population at the site of occupational activities of these migrants approximately 250 km from Jabalpur was also screened by both methods. The results of this field investigation are very encouraging. Among migrants, the test had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 67%. The positive and negative predictive values were 94% and 100%, respectively. Among indigenous population, the corresponding values were 100%, 97.3%, 98.4%, and 100%, respectively, indicating the usefulness of test as a diagnostic tool for providing on-site confirmation of symptomatic diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria."

The study area was mountainous with tropical rain forest. An. leucosphyrus and An. donaldi were predominant in the farm huts. An. tessellatus and An. subpictus were more abundant in the village settlements. In both ecotypes, human baited traps yielded a significantly greater proportion of Anopheles mosquito than CDC light traps and landing biting catches. Circumsporozoite antigen positively rate, mosquito survival rate and parasite rate showed that malaria transmission is more intense in farm huts than in longhouse settlements. The entomological inoculation rate of An. donaldi and An. leucosphyrus in farm huts was 0.035 and 0.023, respectively. No sporozoite infections were observed in the main settlements."
CD008122,0,8059917,0,Characterization of naturally acquired human IgG responses against the N-terminal region of the merozoite surface protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax.,"The primary structure of the merozoite surface protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax (PvMSP-1) revealed the existence of conserved and polymorphic blocks of the protein among different Plasmodium species. To characterize the naturally acquired IgG antibody responses to the PvMSP-1 molecule, the entire N-terminal portion of this protein was expressed as 10 overlapping glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. The affinity-purified recombinant products were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot against the sera of malaria patients from the state of Rondonia, Brazil. We found that the majority of these sera did not contain IgG antibodies recognizing recombinant proteins expressing exclusively interspecies conserved blocks of the molecule. In contrast, a high proportion of these same sera reacted against recombinant products expressing interspecies polymorphic regions of this protein. The poor B cell immunogenicity of the interspecies conserved blocks of the PvMSP-1 molecule most likely reflects important and unknown structural or functional features of these regions."
CD008122,0,8740544,0,Immunity to Plasmodium berghei exoerythrocytic forms derived from irradiated sporozoites.,"The nature of immunity generated by Plasmodium berghei exoerythrocytic (EE) stages developing from irradiated sporozoites was studied using in vivo parameters of host protection on immunization with irradiated sporozoites and in vitro parameters of inhibition of sporozoite invasion and EE form development by serum antibodies from immunized mice. On in vivo challenge of immunized mice by sporozoites, protection was observed in an irradiation-dose-dependent manner. This finding stresses that protection is dependent on the irradiation dose of sporozoites that allows sporozoite penetration yet controls EE form development within the liver. Using the human hepatoma line Hep G2 as host cells in vitro, we observed that serum antibodies raised in mice immunized with irradiated sporozoites reacted with sporozoite- and hepatic-stage parasites in an immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). No reactivity was observed with blood-stage parasites. Serum antibodies from mice immunized with 6- to 18-krad-irradiated sporozoites inhibited sporozoite invasion and caused severe inhibition of EE form development in hepatoma cells, pointing to the antigenic content of EE forms developing from irradiated sporozoites (irra EE forms) as critical immunogens. Moreover, in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum antibodies raised to 12-krad-irradiated sporozoites showed reactivity to synthetic peptides representing the conserved Region II sequences of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein as well as the P. falciparum liver-stage-specific antigen (LSA-1)-based repeat sequences, thus implicating an important role for both the sporozoite and the hepatic stage in protection."
CD008122,0,15667717,0,Leptospirosis in febrile men ingesting Agouti paca in South America.,"To explore the relationship between the ingestion of Agouti paca (AP) and human leptospirosis in Guyana, 19 febrile men who said they had hunted and eaten A. paca were screened for malaria, using bloodsmears, and for leptospirosis, using an enzyme immuno-assay that detects Leptospira -specific IgM. Those found positive for anti-Leptospira IgM were then evaluated further, with a microscopical agglutination test based on a limited panel of serovars from three pathogenic species of Leptospira. Although six of the 18 patients who provided suitable samples for the serology were found seropositive for acute leptospirosis, only three of the 19 patients were found smear-positive for malaria. A clinical-decision model, based on medical histories, the results of physical examinations, and the use of routine urine dipsticks, and enabling prediction of the serological results, was developed. This model, which had 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity for leptospirosis, indicated that, in the absence of serology, most febrile patients reporting AP ingestion could be correctly treated if each was checked for malaria using traditional bloodsmears. The smear-positives should be treated with antimalarial drugs whereas the smear-negatives should be treated for leptospirosis if they had any of the following: a skin rash; lymphadenopathy; abnormal urine sediment (proteinuria or haematuria); and/or no previous history of malaria. In the present study, the relative risk of leptospirosis among the patients who were smear-negative for malaria and fulfilled at least one of these four criteria was 13 (P = 0.0007). In Guyana at least, leptospirosis appears to be common among men who hunt, prepare and ingest AP. Vaccines may be the best, practical form of protection among such men."
CD008122,0,19172295,0,"Initial characterization of Pf62, a novel protein of Plasmodium falciparum identified by immunoscreening.","In order to find new antigens from Plasmodium falciparum, a complementary DNA (cDNA) library was constructed and screened. The study of expression library of P. falciparum was performed in an attempt to identify new antigens that could have potential relevance for the falciparum-malaria diagnosis and/or protection. Between the positive clones detected (ring erythrocyte surface antigen, merozoite erythrocyte surface antigen, RHOP H3, CSP, LSA), a new gene that correspond to a new protein (Pf62) was isolated and characterized. This antigen was useful for the diagnosis of malaria in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. The cDNA corresponding to this antigen and structure of the gene were characterized. Pf62 is a single copy gene that contains one exon. The Pf62 cDNA has an open reading frame of 1,599 nucleotides that code for a putative protein of 532 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa. The polypeptide contains in the central section two regions of repeats of 21 and 19 amino acids, respectively. The localization of the Pf62 protein was performed by immunoblot, indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunoelectron microscopy. Pf62 is localized in the cytoplasm of the parasite and also on the surface of the infected erythrocyte. Serologic assays by using synthetic peptides designed from different antigenic regions of the Pf62 protein resulted in acceptable data of sensitivity and specificity in symptomatic malaria patients."
CD008122,0,17459379,0,"Plasmodium vivax: molecular cloning, expression and characterization of glutathione S-transferase.","Malaria parasite glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are postulated to be essential for parasite survival by protecting the parasite against oxidative stress and buffering the detoxification of heme-binding compounds; therefore, GSTs are considered potential targets for drug development. In this study, we identified a Plasmodium vivax gene encoding GST (PvGST) and characterized the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzyme. The PvGST contained 618 bp that encoded 205 amino acids and shared a significant degree of sequence identity with GSTs from other Plasmodium species. The recombinant homodimeric enzyme had an approximate molecular mass of 50kDa and exhibited GSH-conjugating and GSH-peroxidase activities towards various model substrates. The optimal pH for recombinant PvGST (rPvGST) activity was pH 8.0, and the enzyme was moderately unstable at 37 degrees C. The K(m) values of rPvGST with respect to GSH and CDNB were 0.17+/-0.09 and 2.1+/-0.4mM, respectively. The significant sequence homology and similar biochemical properties of PvGST and Plasmodium falciparum GST (PfGST) indicate that they may have similar molecular structures. This information may be useful for the design of specific inhibitors for plasmodial GSTs as potential antimalarial drugs."
CD008122,0,10403326,0,Detection of specific antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum in blood bank donors from malaria-endemic and non-endemic areas of Venezuela.,"Malaria antibody detection is valuable in providing retrospective confirmation of an attack of malaria. Blood bank screening is another area were malaria serology is potentially useful. In the present study, we tested the presence of antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum in sera from blood bank donors of non-endemic and malaria-endemic areas of Venezuela. Sera from 1,000 blood donors were tested by an indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay and an IgG-ELISA for the presence of malaria antibodies using a synchronized in vitro-cultured Venezuelan isolate of P. falciparum as the antigen source. A selected group of positive and negative sera (n = 100) was also tested by a dot-IgG-ELISA. Positive results (reciprocal titer > or = 40) were found in 0.8% and 3.8% of blood donors when tested by the IFA assay and in 0.8% and 2% (optical density > or = 0.2) when tested by the IgG-ELISA in Caracas (non-endemic area) and Bolivar City (endemic area), respectively. The presence of anti-malarial antibodies in some sera from non-endemic areas such as Caracas reflects the increased potential risk of post-transfusional malaria in those areas due to the mobility of the blood donors. The data obtained indicate the need to implement new blood donor policy in blood banks in developing areas. Our results also indicate that the IFA assay is the most reliable test to use in malaria serodiagnosis."

CD008122,0,14529537,0,Immunodiagnosis of parasitic diseases with synthetic peptides.,"Parasitic diseases remain as a major public health problem worldwide, not only based on their historically high morbidity and mortality rates, but also because risk factors associated with their transmission are increasing. Laboratory diagnosis and particularly immunodiagnosis is a basic tool for the demonstration, clinical management and control of these infections. Classically, the serological tests for the detection of antibodies or antigens are based on the use of crude and purified antigens. Synthetic peptides have opened a new field and perspectives, as the source of pure epitopes and molecules for diagnosis of malaria, Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, hidatidosis, cysticercosis and fasciolosis based on the detection of antibodies and circulating antigens. Herein, are critically reviewed the relevant advances and applications of the synthetic peptides on immunodiagnosis of parasitic diseases. A variety of sequences, constructs (monomers, polymers, MAPs), immunological methods and samples have been used, demonstrating their diagnostic potential. However, in most parasitic infections it is necessary to use more than a single peptide in order to avoid the genetic restriction against certain epitopes, as well as to test them in well characteized groups of patients, in order to confirm their sensitivity and specificity. The concept of multidiagnosis with synthetic peptides, using a novel multi-dot blot assay is introduced. Finally, the chemical imitation of antigens, offers a tremendous posibilities in the diagnosis of parasitic infections in developing countries since this strategy is cheaper, simpler, reproducible, useful for large scale testing and in most cases, specific and sensitive."

Here, we examined sequence diversity at the msp-2 locus in Brazil and its impact on MSP-2 antibody recognition by local patients. Only 25 unique partial sequences of msp-2 were found in 61 isolates examined. The finding of identical msp-2 sequences in unrelated parasites, collected 6-13 years apart, suggests that no major directional selection is exerted by variant-specific immunity in this malaria-endemic area. To examine antibody cross-reactivity, recombinant polypeptides derived from locally prevalent and foreign MSP-2 variants were used in ELISA. Foreign IC1-type variants, such as 3D7 (currently tested for human vaccination), were less frequently recognized than FC27-type and local IC1-type variants. Antibodies discriminated between local and foreign IC1-type variants, but cross-recognized structurally different local IC1-type variants. The use of evolutionary models of MSP-2 is suggested to design vaccines that minimize differences between local parasites and vaccine antigens."

Sample preparation involved protein precipitation, followed by a solid-phase clean-up and a liquid-liquid extraction. Chromatographic separation was carried out on an Ultrasphere C8 column (25 cm x 4.6 mm I.D., 5 microns particle size) using a mobile phase of acetonitrile:water, 75:25, (vol/vol), with 0.2% (w/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.2% (vol/vol) glacial acetic acid. The serum sample volume used was 0.5 ml, with concentrations normalized to 1 ml. Retention times for BHAL, HAL, and the internal standard were 5.5, 8.3, and 11.5 min, respectively, with a total run time of 13.5 min. The average extraction recovery for HAL was 85.6% and 100.5% for BHAL. Inter- and intra-assay precisions of HAL and BHAL were less than or equal to 7.5%, with an accuracy of less than or equal to 10.8% over three concentrations (0.02, 0.5, 2.0 micrograms/ml). Detection limits of HAL and BHAL were 5 and 3 ng/ml, respectively. The new HPLC method resulted in cleaner chromatograms and a 1.7-fold faster run time than previous HPLC methods.

CD008122,0,16629703,0,Transmission-reducing immunity is inversely related to age in Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte carriers.,"Immunity to the sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum is induced during natural infections and can significantly reduce the transmission of parasites to mosquitoes (transmission reducing activity; TRA) but little is known about how these responses develop with increasing age/exposure to malaria. Routinely TRA is measured in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). Sera were collected from a total of 199 gametocyte carriers (median age 4 years, quartiles 2 and 9 years) near Ifakara, Tanzania; 128 samples were tested in the SMFA and generated TRA data classified as a reduction of > 50% and > 90% of transmission. TRA of > 50% was highest in young children (aged 1-2) with a significant decline with age (chi(2) trend = 5.79, P = 0.016) and in logistic regression was associated with prevalence of antibodies to both Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 (OR 4.03, P = 0.011 and OR 2.43 P = 0.059, respectively). A TRA of > 90% reduction in transmission was not age related but was associated with antibodies to Pfs48/45 (OR 2.36, P = 0.055). Our data confirm that antibodies are an important component of naturally induced TRA. However, whilst a similar but small proportion of individuals at all ages have TRA > 90%, the gradual deterioration of TRA > 50% with age suggests decreased antibody concentration or affinity. This may be due to decreased exposure to gametocytes, probably as a result of increased asexual and/or gametocyte specific immunity."

CD008122,0,15491471,0,A protective merozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum shares an epitope with surface antigens of Paramecium.,"A Plasmodium falciparum cDNA expression clone, lambdaPf9, had been identified earlier as a protective epitope, using anti-lambdaPf9 antibodies and combinatorial phagotopes. A segment of the Pf9 gene showed homology with Paramecium immobilization surface antigens such as 51B, 51A and 156G. A synthetic Pf9-peptide was designed from this region, and specific antibodies were raised. Each of these anti-Pf9 antibodies and combinatorial reagents, as well as anti-Paramecium 51B antibodies, recognized the Pf9-peptide on ELISA, and the same protein band in parasite immunoblots. The P. falciparum protein was released from the merozoite membrane fraction on treatment with PI-PLC, indicating the presence of a GPI anchor. Anti-Pf9-peptide antibodies specifically inhibited the growth of P. falciparum in culture. Immunofluorescence assays showed the reactivity of anti-Pf9-peptide sera with P. falciparum merozoites and gametocytes, as well as on the surface of Paramecium tetraurelia. The Pf9-peptide was able to induce proliferation of splenic lymphocytes obtained from mice infected with the rodent malarial parasites Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium yoelii. These results point towards Plasmodium Pf9 as a conserved novel protective protein, sharing an epitope with Paramecium surface antigens."

This antigen has been expressed as a full-length, nonfusion, recombinant baculovirus protein (PF83-7G8-1) using the authentic predicted signal peptide for appropriate postsynthetic routing. When purified by a novel high-performance, ion exchange chromatography (HPIEC) method, PF83-7G8-1 induced polyclonal antibodies in rats that immunoprecipitated both 83- and 66-kD forms of PF83/AMA-1 from 35S-methionine metabolically labeled parasite extracts. Using HPIEC-purified PF83-7G8-1 in combination with a rat monoclonal antibody against the highly conserved carboxy-terminal (CT) region of PF83/AMA-1, we developed a CT-capture-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure naturally acquired responses against the entire PF83/AMA-1 molecule. Analysis of populations from villages in Guinea-Bissau and in an area of high malarial transmission in Senegal demonstrated a very high prevalence (94-100%) of naturally acquired serum IgG responses to PF83/AMA-1. Analysis of these natural responses showed that PF83/AMA-1 may be a well-recognized asexual parasite antigen. A statistically significant age-related change in antibody levels to PF83/AMA-1 was observed in Guinea-Bissau. No such correlation was observed in the Senegalese population, although an age-related antibody response was seen for total parasite antigen. No significant correlation was observed between PF83/AMA-1 responses and the parameters of parasite load and malaria-related fever."

CD008122,0,17822537,0,World Antimalarial Resistance Network (WARN) IV: clinical pharmacology.,"A World Antimalarial Resistance Network (WARN) database has the potential to improve the treatment of malaria, through informing current drug selection and use and providing a prompt warning of when treatment policies need changing. This manuscript outlines the contribution and structure of the clinical pharmacology component of this database. The determinants of treatment response are multi-factorial, but clearly providing adequate blood concentrations is pivotal to curing malaria. The ability of available antimalarial pharmacokinetic data to inform optimal dosing is constrained by the small number of patients studied, with even fewer (if any) studies conducted in the most vulnerable populations. There are even less data relating blood concentration data to the therapeutic response (pharmacodynamics). By pooling all available pharmacokinetic data, while paying careful attention to the analytical methodologies used, the limitations of small (and thus underpowered) individual studies may be overcome and factors that contribute to inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters defined. Key variables for pharmacokinetic studies are defined in terms of patient (or study subject) characteristics, the formulation and route of administration of the antimalarial studied, the sampling and assay methodology, and the approach taken to data analysis. Better defining these information needs and criteria of acceptability of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) studies should contribute to improving the quantity, relevance and quality of these studies. A better understanding of the pharmacokinetic properties of antimalarials and a more clear definition of what constitutes ""therapeutic drug levels"" would allow more precise use of the term ""antimalarial resistance"", as it would indicate when treatment failure is not caused by intrinsic parasite resistance but is instead the result of inadequate drug levels. The clinical pharmacology component of the WARN database can play a pivotal role in monitoring accurately for true antimalarial drug resistance and promptly correcting sub-optimal dosage regimens to prevent these contributing to the emergence and spread of antimalarial resistance."
CD008122,0,17822533,0,World Antimalarial Resistance Network (WARN) II: in vitro antimalarial drug susceptibility.,"Intrinsic resistance of Plasmodium falciparum is clearly a major determinant of the clinical failure of antimalarial drugs. However, complex interactions between the host, the parasite and the drug obscure the ability to define parasite drug resistance in vivo. The in vitro antimalarial drug susceptibility assay determines ex-vivo growth of parasite in the presence of serial drug concentrations and, thus, eliminates host effects, such as drug metabolism and immunity. Although the sensitivity of the parasite to various antimalarials provided by such a test provides an important indicator of intrinsic parasite susceptibility, there are fundamental methodological issues that undermine comparison of in vitro susceptibility both between laboratories and within a single laboratory over time. A network of laboratories is proposed that will agree on the basic parameters of the in vitro test and associated measures of quality control. The aim of the network would be to establish baseline values of sensitivity to commonly used antimalarial agents from key regions of the world, and create a global database, linked to clinical, molecular and pharmacology databases, to support active surveillance to monitor temporal trends in parasite susceptibility. Such a network would facilitate the rapid detection of strains with novel antimalarial resistance profiles and investigate suitable alternative treatments with retained efficacy."

Spatial patterns in circumsporozoite rates for P. falciparum, P. vivax isomorphs K210 and K247, and P. malariae, and the proportions of mosquito blood meals positive for specific human, goat, cat, dog and pig antigens were determined using ELISAs. P. falciparum prevalence in humans was better explained by bednet coverage in the immediate vicinity than by personal protection alone. Circumsporozoite rates for both P. falciparum and P. vivax were also inversely related to coverage with bednets. There was some increase in zoophagy in areas with high coverage, but relatively little effect on the human blood index or on overall mosquito densities. In this setting, protracted use of untreated bednets apparently reduces sporozoite rates, and the associated effects on prevalence are greater than can be accounted for by personal protection. Even at high bednet coverage most anophelines feed on human hosts, so the decreased sporozoite rates are likely to be largely due to reduction of mosquito survival. This finding highlights the importance of local vector ecology for outcomes of bednet programmes and suggests that area effects of untreated bednets should be reassessed in other settings."

Evidence that the protective immunity is associated with different classes and subclasses of antibodies reveals the importance of considering the quality of the response. In this study, we have evaluated the humoral immune response against Plasmodium falciparum blood stages of individuals naturally exposed to malaria who live in endemic areas of Brazil in order to assess the prevalence of different specific isotypes and their association with different malaria clinical expressions."

CD008122,0,14584384,0,Involvement of interleukin-18 in severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Serum levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and immunoglobulin E (IgE) were determined for 96 patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria admitted to hospital, Bangkok, Thailand in the period 1998-2000. The patients were divided into 3 groups, i.e. uncomplicated, severe and cerebral malaria according to WHO criteria (2000). Elevation of IL-18 levels was observed in all 3 groups, with a tendency for higher levels in cases with severe malaria throughout the course of the disease. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between IL-18 levels and the extent of parasitaemia among patients with severe malaria. However, IL-18 levels decreased more significantly in patients with cerebral malaria compared with the other groups in the late stage of the disease. Elevated levels of IFN-gamma were also observed in all groups of patients, especially in those with severe or cerebral malaria, and the levels in patients with cerebral malaria remained significantly higher than in those with uncomplicated malaria during days 4-7 post-treatment, suggesting the involvement of IFN-gamma in disease severity. Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed in IgE levels between the severe and uncomplicated groups of patients with helminth infection, although IgE levels were significantly higher in helminth-infected patients than uninfected patients. These results suggest that IL-18 plays a key role in inducing severe malaria through another pathway, such as elevation of IFN-gamma, rather than its IgE inducing activity."
CD008122,0,12705786,0,The current status of parasitic diseases in Japan.,"In Japan parasitic diseases have been considered to be successfully controlled in the last 30 years. However, some parasitic diseases, such as food-borne zoonoses and/or larva migrans, are emerging and/or re-emerging in Japan. Furthermore, imported parasitic diseases like malaria are also gradually increasing. Unfortunately accurate numbers of parasitic diseases other than echinococcosis, malaria, amebiasis, giardiasis, or cryptosporidiosis are obscure in Japan because of the lack of a legal registration system. Since symptoms and diagnostic imaging patterns of parasitic diseases are non-specific and have similarities with other infectious diseases or cancer, parasitic diseases are sometimes overlooked or left misdiagnosed. In this review, the current status of parasitic diseases in Japan is briefly summarized based on the analysis of the accumulated cases seen in our department. We also outline the clinical features, differential diagnosis and treatment of representative parasitic diseases for the better understanding and management of the parasitic diseases in Japan."
CD008122,0,18342279,0,Molecular diagnostic and surveillance tools for global malaria control.,"Malaria is the most devastating parasitic infection in the world, annually causing over 1 million deaths and extensive morbidity. The global burden of malaria has increased over the last several decades, as have rates of imported malaria into non-endemic regions. Rapid and accurate diagnostics are a crucial component of malaria control strategies, and epidemiological surveillance is required to monitor trends in malaria prevalence and antimalarial drug resistance. Conventional malaria diagnostic and surveillance tools can be cumbersome and slow with limitations in both sensitivity and specificity. New molecular techniques have been developed in an attempt to overcome these restrictions. These molecular techniques are discussed with regard to their technical advantages and disadvantages, with an emphasis on the practicality of implementation in malaria-endemic and non-endemic regions."
CD008122,0,11230422,1,Persistent ICT malaria P.f/P.v panmalarial and HRP2 antigen reactivity after treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is associated with gametocytemia and results in false-positive diagnoses of Plasmodium vivax in convalescence.,"A problem with rapid Plasmodium falciparum-specific antigen histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) detection tests for malaria is the persistence of antigen in blood after the disappearance of asexual-stage parasitemia and clinical symptoms, resulting in false-positive (FP) test results following treatment. The ICT P.f/P.v immunochromatographic test detects both HRP2 and a panmalarial antigen (PMA) found in both P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. To examine posttreatment antigen persistence with this test and whether persistent sexual-stage forms (gametocytes) are a cause of FP tests after treatment, we compared serial antigen test results with microscopy results from patients symptomatic with P. falciparum malaria in Indonesia for 28 days following treatment with chloroquine (CQ; n = 66), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; n = 36), and artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (ART + SP; n = 15). Persistent FP antigenemia following SP treatment occurred in 29% (HRP2) and 42% (PMA) of the patients on day 7 and in 10% (HRP2) and 23% (PMA) on day 14. The high rates of persistent HRP2 and PMA antigenemia following CQ and SP treatment were strongly associated with the presence of gametocytemia, with the proportion with gametocytes on day 7 posttreatment being significantly greater in those with FP results than in those with true-negative PMA and HRP2 results. Gametocyte frequency on day 14 post-SP treatment was also greater in those with FP PMA results. Following SP treatment, PMA persisted longer than HRP2, giving an FP diagnosis of P. vivax in up to 16% of patients on day 14, with all FP P. vivax diagnoses having gametocytemia. In contrast, PMA was rapidly cleared following ART + SP treatment in association with rapid clearance of gametocytemia. Gametocytes appear to be an important cause of persistent posttreatment panmalarial antigenemia in areas of endemicity and may also contribute in part to persistent HRP2 antigenemia following treatment."
CD008122,0,3316380,0,Serological diagnostics of imported malaria in Czechoslovakia.,"Two serologic techniques for malaria detection were compared in this study; the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test used in 214 persons (38 Czechoslovak citizens returning from visits to tropical countries and 176 foreign visitors arriving to Czechoslovakia from areas endemic for malaria) and the indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test employed in 125 persons (29 Czechoslovak citizens and 96 foreigners). Comparisons revealed poor correlation between the IFA test and IHA test data. Of the two tests the IFA test appeared to be distinctly more reliable, more sensitive and more specific, the IHA test turned out to yield both false positive and false negative results. The antigen from Plasmodium gallinaceum gave lower IFA titres than P. falciparum antigen, but reacted with antibodies to all species of human plasmodia, and gave reliable test results. Positive serologic responses were appreciably more frequent in foreigners (46.0%) than Czechoslovak citizens (23.7%). The maximum percent positivity for malarial antibody was among individuals from tropical countries of Africa (74.6%), seropositivity in people from malaria endemic areas in Asia and Latin America was far less frequent (28.4% and 44.4%, respectively)."

CD008122,0,11990096,0,Chemotherapy and prevention of drug-resistant malaria.,"Drug-resistant falciparum and vivax malaria will continue to be an increasing problem. The incidence of drug-resistant malaria has been increasing at a rate that exceeds new drug development. Plasmodium falciparum has rapidly developed resistance to new synthetic antimalarials, including mefloquine and halofantrine. P. vivax malaria resistant to chloroquine and primaquine is now widespread in parts of Oceania; the optimal therapy for this infection is unknown. At present, a combination of qinghaosu derivatives and mefloquine appears to be the most active drug regimen against multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria from Southeast Asia. However, qinghaosu compounds are not yet licensed and widely available. The capacity of P. falciparum to rapidly develop drug resistance and the growing evidence that other plasmodia can evolve resistance suggests that within the next 10 years, we face the real prospect of untreatable malaria. Ultimately, control of malaria may require more creative approaches than additional inhibitory drugs. These might include: the identification of biochemical pathways unique to the parasite (such as drug efflux and heme polymerase), making it possible to design new classes of antimalarial agents that are selectively toxic to the parasite; methods to block parasite development in the mosquito vector; and multistage vaccines against both asexual and sexual stages in order to block both the pathophysiology and transmission of disease."

In wealthy countries, poor familiarity with malaria may lead to clinical and laboratory misdiagnosis. Giemsa thick and thin blood films remain the current standard for diagnosis. Although it has good sensitivity and allows species identification and parasite counts, it is time consuming, requires microscopic expertise and maintenance of equipment. Microscopy with fluorescent stains (QBC), dipstick antigen detection of HRP2 and pLDH (Parasight-F, ICT Malaria Pf, OptiMAL), polymerase chain reaction assays and some automated blood cell analyzers offer new approaches and are reviewed here, with emphasis on clinical relevance and the potential to complement conventional microscopy."
CD008122,0,2004813,0,Human antibody response to the major merozoite surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum is strain specific and short-lived.,"The precursor of the major merozoite antigen of Plasmodium falciparum, gp190, is considered a candidate for inclusion in a malaria vaccine. This protein, which consists of conserved, dimorphic, and polymorphic sequences, is very immunogenic in humans. In a longitudinal study carried out with 94 inhabitants of a rural community in Mali, West Africa, we show that in this endemic area naturally acquired gp190-specific antibodies are predominantly directed against the dimorphic parts of one of the main alleles of gp190. The presence of antibodies against these dimorphic regions correlates with the prevalence of the corresponding antigen in the infecting parasite population. Moreover, qualitative as well as quantitative differences were found in the time course of the humoral immune response to the dimorphic regions in adults and children, who differ in their susceptibility to malaria infection."
CD008122,0,8296363,0,The rapid manual ParaSight-F test. A new diagnostic tool for Plasmodium falciparum infection.,"A rapid manual test for Plasmodium falciparum, the ParaSight-F test, has been used on a series of patients in a holoendemic malaria area of coastal Tanzania. The test, which is an antigen capture test detecting trophozoite-derived histidine rich protein-II, is simple to perform and provides a definitive answer in about 10 min. It requires no special equipment and is read using a single drop of blood. When compared with 272 thick blood films examined microscopically by 2 observers and confirmed by the QBC malaria test, the ParaSight-F test had 88.9% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity. Detectable antigenaemia in a group of 40 people declined following treatment with Fansidar and by 10 d after treatment all but 4 individuals were antigen free. The remaining 4, although clear of peripheral parasitaemia, remained antigenaemic for 14 d. The test shows great promise for rapid effective diagnosis of P. falciparum in clinics and village health centres where there is no facility for microscopy. Because of its accuracy and rapid action it may even obviate the need for microscopical examination of blood films to diagnose P. falciparum malaria."
CD008122,0,12731420,0,[Parasite detection and symptoms of parasitic diseases. 1: Blood parasites].,"Blood parasites are malaria plasmodia, microfilaria species, trypanosomes (the causative agents of African sleeping sickness and South American Changas disease) and the causative agents of schistosomiasis of the bladder and the intestine. Their geographical distribution, incubation periods, signs and symptoms, microscopic and serological methods are described. In Germany around 1,000 tourists contract malaria every year, mostly travellers to Africa. Over 70% suffer from the life-threatening P. falciparum infection. Only a few days after the onset of this flu-like disease, complications may evolve. The best diagnostic method is the thin blood film. In case of a negative result this procedure must be repeated twice daily. The thick film requires experience. Rapid diagnostic tests can be helpful but are hampered by false negative results. Filaria loa loa may cause skin swellings, involvement of the eye and even the CNS; Wuchereria bancrofti can cause severe lymphedema. West African sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma gambiense) ends up in encephalitis, the East African form (T. rhodesiense) in a polyserositis.

The results of three surveys were analyzed to examine the relation of these serologic measures with age, parasite rate, and spleen size. For children 0-4 years old, increasing spleen size was associated with an increasing likelihood of malaria parasitemia, while for 5-9 year olds the two variables were unrelated. Parasite rate declined with age and ELISA titre increased with age in all surveys; IFA titre was consistently high and did not vary with age. Neither antibody measure was significantly correlated with either the presence or the actual density of parasitemia. These antibody measures are most useful as adjuncts to the more traditional techniques of malaria assessment."

The assay was compared to ELISAs using crude amastigote and promastigote antigens from L. donovani and the major surface glycoprotein (Gp63) from either L. donovani or L. major as a solid-phase ligand. The sensitivity of the assays was tested in 33 patients suffering from CL caused by L. major. The sensitivity of the GBP peptide (GBPP) ELISA was 82%. This was higher than in the assays using crude amastigote (67%) or promastigote (67%) antigens, but the difference was not statistically significant. The sensitivity in the assays using Gp63 from L. donovani (52%) or L. major (39%) was significantly lower than in the assay using GBPP (P = 0.019 and P < 0.001, respectively). Plasma samples from healthy Sudanese individuals living in an area endemic for malaria but free of leish-maniasis were negative in all the assays. Significantly higher levels of antibodies were found in the patients who had suffered from the disease for more than eight weeks than in patients with a shorter clinical history (GBPP ELISA; P = 0.038; amastigote ELISA; P = 0.004; and promastigote ELISA; P = 0.017). In the former group, the sensitivities of the five ELISAs were 100% (GBPP), 87% (amastigote), 93% (promastigote), 67% (L. donovani), and 53% (L. major), respectively."

Judging from the present epidemiological, social and economic conditions, it can be said with confidence that malaria with ""unstable"" characteristic in the Republic of Korea has already been disappeared. No doubt, the causes of the disappearance of malaria are complex. Certainly improved living conditions and life style; better medical and educational facilities in the wake of a rapid economic development could all have some role. On the other hand, the disappearance of malaria without large scale control operations could be ascribed to the two main factors: one is malaria case detection and simultaneous drug therapy available through the nation-wide passive case detection network during the 1960s and the other is rapidly improved farming practices begun in 1970s, which resulted in the use of a huge quantity of pesticides and other chemicals for agriculture, which, in turn, might affect local anopheline vectors which were originally not effective ones any way."

The IgG seroreactivity from other regions ranged from 0.0% to 2.0%. These epidemiological data of seroprevalence in five regions of Korea showed a similar pattern to the annual incidence of malaria in these respective regions.

The sensitivity for acridine orange staining was 82.2% (95% CI = 77-86%), the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI = 97.6-99.1%), and the positive predictive value was 94.1% (95% CI = 90-97%); with a P. falciparum asexual parasitemia higher than 21 parasites/microliter, the dipstick was 100% sensitive, when parasitemia was 10-20/microliter, sensitivity was 88%, and when parasitemia was less than 10/microliter, it was only 13.4%. The dipstick assay meets the criteria for an appropriate, rapid, and reliable test for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and has advantages over the acridine orange staining method.

The partially purified enzyme was specifically tagged with radioactive DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. A major protein band of 49 kilodalton was obtained while with the purified mouse enzyme, a typical 53 kilodalton band, was observed. The catalytic activity of parasite enzyme was dependent on pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and was optimal at pH 8.0. The apparent Michaelis constant for L-ornithine was 52 microM. DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine efficiently and irreversibly inhibited ornithine decarboxylase activity from P. falciparum grown in vitro or Plasmodium berghei grown in vivo. The Ki of the human malarial enzyme for this inhibitor was 16 microM. Ornithine decarboxylase activity in P. falciparum cultures was rapidly lost upon exposure to the direct product, putrescine. Despite the profound inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide in vitro, parasite enzyme activity was only slightly reduced by 75 min of treatment, suggesting a relatively long half-life for the malarial enzyme. Ornithine decarboxylase activity from P. falciparum and P. berghei was not eliminated by antiserum prepared against purified mouse enzyme. Furthermore, RNA or DNA extracted from P. falciparum failed to hybridize to a mouse ornithine decarboxylase cDNA probe. These results suggest that ODC from P. falciparum bears some structural differences as compared to the mammalian enzyme."

During a 7-12 month period, we immunized four volunteers via the bites of irradiated, infected mosquitoes. Following these exposures to attenuated sporozoites, all four volunteers developed antibodies to sporozoites as measured by an immunofluorescence assay and by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the circumsporozoite (CS) protein repeat-based molecule R32LR as capture antigen. Three volunteers also developed antibodies against the nonrepeating (flanking) regions of the CS protein; the level of these antibodies paralleled the serum activity to inhibit sporozoite invasion of hepatoma cells in vitro. These three volunteers were protected against malaria transmitted by the bites of five infected mosquitoes. Two of these protected volunteers received additional immunizing doses of irradiated sporozoites and were subsequently protected against challenge with a heterologous P. falciparum clone. No detectable fluctuations were observed in circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor, interferon-gamma, or interleukin-6 during the course of this study. Analysis of the humoral and cellular immune responses of these protected volunteers is expected to yield important clues to additional targets of immunity against the pre-erythrocytic stages of malaria parasites."

In this system, freed parasites of P. falciparum could be plotted separately from erythrocyte ghosts, white blood cells and platelets on the two-dimensional scattergram of forward-angle light scatter and green fluorescence by flow cytometry with an argon laser. It took only 2-3 min per sample to obtain the scattergram and analyze the data, including the time of sample preparation for flow cytometric analysis. Sample preparation with this method does not require any difficult handling procedures.

Values for parasite inhibition with known anti-malarial drugs using the PicoGreen assay were comparable with those determined by the standard method based upon the uptake of 3H-hypoxanthine and the Giemsa stain microscopic technique. The PicoGreen assay is rapid, sensitive, reproducible, easily interpreted, and ideally suited for screening of large numbers of samples for anti-malarial drug development."
CD008122,0,17906843,0,A case of hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly. The role of rapid antigen-detecting and PCR-based tests.,"Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) - originally referred to as tropical splenomegaly syndrome - is characterized by a massive splenomegaly, high titres of anti-malarial antibodies and polyclonal IgM hypergammaglobulinemia. It is believed to be a consequence of an aberrant immunological response to prolonged exposure to malarial parasites. Although it is a frequent disease in the tropics, it is infrequent in western countries and is only seen in long-term residents from endemic areas. We describe the case of a 67-year-old Spanish man, a missionary in Cameroon for 30 years, who presented with a clinical history that fulfilled the diagnosis of HMS. We discuss the role and importance of PCR-based techniques in demonstrating lowgrade malarial parasitemia and the usefulness of new rapid antigen-detecting dipstick tests."

CD008122,0,17548134,0,Immunogenicity and in vitro protective efficacy of a polyepitope Plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccine constructed by epitope shuffling.,"A polyepitope chimeric antigen incorporating multiple protective and conservative epitopes from multiple antigens of Plasmodium falciparum has been considered to be more effective in inducing multiple layers of immunity against malaria than a single stage- or single antigen-based vaccine. By modifying the molecular breeding approach to epitope shuffling, we have constructed a polyepitope chimeric gene that encodes 11 B-cell and T-cell proliferative epitope peptides derived from eight key antigens mostly in the blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum. A 35-kDa antigen encoded by this gene, named Malaria RCAg-1, was purified from an E. coli expression system. Immunization of rabbits and mice with the purified protein in the presence of Freund's adjuvant strongly generated long-lasting antibody responses that recognized the corresponding individual epitope peptide in this vaccine as well as blood stage parasites. CD4(+) T-cell responses were also elicited as shown by the enhancement of T-cell proliferation, IFN-gamma and IL-4 level. In vitro assay of protection revealed that vaccine-elicited antibodies could efficiently inhibit the growth of blood-stage parasites. Additionally, the chimeric antigen was recognized by human serum specimens from malaria patients and individuals living in the endemic area. Our studies indicate the potential of M.RCAg-1 recombinant protein as malaria candidate vaccines as well as the rationale of the epitope shuffling technology applied in designing malaria vaccines."
CD008122,0,7684635,0,Use of a recombinant baculovirus product to measure naturally-acquired human antibodies to disulphide-constrained epitopes on the P. falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1).,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to measure antibody levels in human sera to a candidate vaccine antigen, merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1), of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. To ensure the detection of antibodies reactive with important conformational epitopes, antigens used in the ELISA were obtained from either in vitro parasite cultures, or from a baculovirus expression system in which correct folding of recombinant MSP1-derived polypeptides has been previously demonstrated. The specificity of the ELISA was confirmed using a novel antibody affinity select method. The assay was used to investigate the pattern of acquisition of anti-MSP1 antibodies in a cross-sectional survey of 387 3-8 year old residents of a malaria endemic area of The Gambia. A significant positive correlation between anti-MSP1 antibody levels and age was evident, though individual responses to two antigens corresponding to two distinct domains of the MSP1 varied widely."

CD008122,0,11441505,0,Experimental infection of Anopheles sinensis with Korean isolates of Plasmodium vivax.,"The objectives of the present study were to (1) determine the susceptibility of Anopheles sinensis to Korean isolates of Plasmodium vivax, (2) establish a method to collect large quantities of P. vivax sporozoites for use as antigen in seroepidemiological studies, and (3) investigate the characteristics of Korean isolates of P. vivax sporozoites. Females of Anopheles sinensis were collected at non-epidemic area, Seokwha-ri, Cheongwon-gun and Chungcheongbuk-do using tent-trap methods coupled with dry ice. The females were artificially infected with gametocytes of P. vivax using blood obtained from P. vivax malaria patients. Individual mosquitoes were infected using either a parafilm-covered glass feeding apparatus or were allowed to feed on naturally infected volunteers. Mosquitoes were sacrificed between 16 and 18 days post-feeding and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect sporozoites. Four (33.4%) of 12 mosquitoes, which were fed on naturally infected volunteers directly, were positive for sporozoites. In cases, the mosquitoes allowed to feed on whole blood which were extract from three different patients with heparin treated vacuutainers using a parafilm-covered glass apparatus. Two of 55 (3.6%) were positive which blood sample was maintained at room temperature for 8 hours, 1 of 68 (1.5%) was positive which blood was maintained at 4 degrees C for 24 hours and 1 of 47 (2.3%) was positive at 4 degrees C for 48 hours.

CD008122,0,15869776,0,Positive control wells: a potential answer to remote-area quality assurance of malaria rapid diagnostic tests.,"Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are a potential breakthrough in the provision of accurate diagnosis in remote areas, but widescale use is hampered by uncertainty over accuracy under field conditions. Positive control wells, which contain recombinant malaria parasite antigen, are a novel method for addressing this need for quality assurance. The potential of a commercially available positive control well, reconstituted with blood, was assessed for use in routine monitoring of RDT sensitivity in a remote malaria-endemic region. When maintained at 4 degrees C, the wells produced a consistent level of parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigen activity, as detected by pLDH-detecting RDTs, but activity reduced after cumulative exposure to temperatures likely to be encountered over a few months in a malaria-endemic area. This limitation was successfully overcome in the field through centralized, controlled storage. Monitoring of RDT sensitivity was successfully incorporated into routine supervisory visits to remote clinics. However, improved temperature stability of the wells would enhance their potential. The threshold at which the wells' signal reduced RDT sensitivity requires further investigation. The wells show potential to overcome an important obstacle to the wide implementation of accurate parasite-based diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Further assessment of their place in malaria management is warranted."

Volunteers received two doses of either formulation on a 0, 1-month schedule. Both vaccines were well tolerated and similarly immunogenic. Nineteen of 25 subjects who received the lyophilized formulation and six infectivity controls underwent sporozoite challenge to assess vaccine efficacy. All six controls had parasitemia detectable by thick blood smear by day 13 (mean pre-patent period 12.3 days; range 11-13). In the vaccine group, 8 of 19 vaccinees did not develop malaria and were completely protected (i.e., 42%). Among the 11 vaccinees who did become infected, the mean pre-patent period was delayed (14.4 days; range 13-18). The two formulations of RTS,S were equally safe and immunogenic, and the lyophilized formulation showed similar levels of efficacy against sporozoite challenge to that conferred by the liquid formulation in previous studies."

We constructed a library from three patients infected with Plasmodium vivax. Panning on recombinant PvRII enriched a population of scFvs that recognized region II of the P. vivax Duffy binding protein (DBP). Three clones of scFvs that reacted with PvRII were selected, and their biological functions were analyzed. These scFvs inhibited erythrocyte binding to DBP. Clone SFDBII92 had the greatest affinity (dissociation constant = 3.62 x 10(-8) M) and the greatest inhibition activity (50% inhibitory concentration approximately 2.9 microg/ml) to DBP. Thus, we demonstrated that human neutralizing antibody could be made from malaria patients using phage display and that these neutralizing scFvs should prove valuable for developing both passive and active immunization strategies based on DBP."
CD008122,0,16926633,0,Dihydroartemisinin inhibits angiogenesis induced by multiple myeloma RPMI8226 cells under hypoxic conditions via downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression and suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor secretion.,"Multiple myeloma remains incurable to date; therefore, new biologically target-based therapies are urgently needed. Our previous studies have showed that the antimalarial dihydroartemisinin possessed antiangiogenic activity in solid tumors. The present study evaluated the effect of dihydroartemisinin on human multiple myeloma-induced angiogenesis under hypoxia and elucidated its mechanism of action. An in-vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane model was used to examine the effect of dihydroartemisinin on multiple myeloma-induced angiogenesis. Compared with conditioned medium of control, conditioned medium from human multiple myeloma RPMI8226 cells pretreated with 3 micromol/l dihydroartemisinin in hypoxia was observed to reduce microvessel growth on chicken chorioallantoic membranes by approximately 28.6% (P<0.05). The level of vascular endothelial growth factor in conditioned medium was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results confirmed that 3 micromol/l dihydroartemisinin could significantly decrease vascular endothelial growth factor secretion by RPMI8226 cells (P<0.05), which correlated well with the reduction of multiple myeloma-induced angiogenesis on chicken chorioallantoic membranes. Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results revealed that dihydroartemisinin downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in RPMI8226 cells in hypoxia. In addition, we demonstrated that dihydroartemisinin reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation and inhibited growth of RPMI8226 cells under hypoxic conditions. Therefore, we concluded that dihydroartemisinin, which is already used to treat malaria and is well tolerated, possesses potential as an antiangiogenic drug in multiple myeloma therapy and thereby may improve patient outcome."

The samples were taken from individuals living in Macapá, Porto Velho and Belém, all of which are endemic areas of vivax malaria in the Amazon region of Brazil. Blood samples were collected on GFMs. The gene that codes for the circumsporozoite proteins of P. vivax variants was amplified by PCR and the amplified fragments were hybridized to variant-specific, digoxigenin-labelled oligonucleotide probes by ELISA. The GFM-PCR-ELISA technique was shown to be accurate for epidemiological surveys of the vivax complex. All variants were detected in all 3 areas, but only P. vivax VK210 was found as a single agent of infection, while the other 2 occurred as mixed infections. The P. vivax-like variant was found to be associated with low parasitaemia and VK210 with the highest parasitaemia levels; none of the P. vivax variants was linked with a previous malaria experience. In all cases parasitaemia clearance was identical regarding the type of treatment and consequently it is not possible to confirm the previously reported correlation between P. vivax genotype and response to chloroquine."
CD008122,0,17434795,0,The diagnosis of malaria and identification of plasmodium species by polymerase chain reaction in Turkey.,"More than half of the world's population is exposed to malaria in approximately 100 countries. Rapid diagnosis and correct treatment of cases are the main objectives of control programs in malaria endemic areas. We have developed a PCR method to determine the presence of plasmodium DNA in blood. The method can also identify the species of the plasmodium by restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified product. We evaluated the performance of this method in the diagnosis of malaria suspected cases in Turkey by comparing to microscopy of the blood smears: blood samples were obtained from 114 patients with malaria symptoms, including fever and/or chills lasting for several days, before starting treatment. Thin and thick blood smears were prepared immediately in the region of specimen collection. After isolation of DNA from blood samples, DNA was amplified by PCR and digested by restriction enzyme AluI. The obtained fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The number of parasites in the thick and thin smears of the blood samples was evaluated microscopically after staining by Giemsa and results were compared by PCR results. Among 114 plasmodium positive cases detected by microscopy, 100 were also detected by PCR. There were 14 false negatives and no false positive by PCR. Compared to microscopy, the sensitivity, specificity and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of PCR were determined as 76%, 100% and 100%, respectively."

CD008122,0,15040560,0,Malaria transmission and major malaria vectors in different geographical areas of Southeast Asia.,"During the last decade, major progress in malaria control has been achieved in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. However, malaria is still a potentially fatal disease in some hilly-forested areas and continues to be endemic in a few coastal foci. To estimate the risk that stems from the major vectors after a decade of intensive malaria control, an entomological study based on human landing collections was conducted between April 1998 and November 2000 in six study villages (four in Vietnam, one in Cambodia and one in Laos) located in different physio-geographical areas. Five villages were selected in places where new cases of malaria still occurred. In the sixth village, in the northern hilly area of Vietnam, no case of malaria was detected during the past 3 years. In three study villages of the hilly forested areas of Cambodia and central Vietnam, Anopheles dirus A still played an important role in malaria transmission and maintain perennial transmission inside the villages despite its low density. Anopheles minimus A was found in all study villages except in the southern coastal village of Vietnam. Its role in malaria transmission, however, varied between localities and surveys. In one study village of central Vietnam it was almost absent (one specimen collected over 480 man nights), and in another village sporozoite positive specimens (2.8%) were only observed during the first two surveys whereas this species disappeared from the collections from November 1998 onwards (six surveys: 360 man nights). In the northern study site An. minimus A and C were found in all collections, but no local malaria transmission occurred. However, the constant presence of these two species associated with a high longevity (parous rate up around 80% and 65%, respectively), suggests that transmission can occur at almost any time if parasite reservoirs are reintroduced in the area. The proper management of malaria cases and population movement is, therefore, important to prevent outbreaks and the reintroduction of malaria in northern Vietnam. In the study site of the Mekong delta, An. sundaicus occurred at high densities (up to 190 bites/man/night). The recent changes in land use from rice cultivation to shrimp farming probably explains the increase of this brackish water breeding species during the study period. However, none of the 11,002 specimens was positive for Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein (CSP). The relative low survival rate as estimated by the parous rate (around 47%) may reflect its low vectorial status that could explain the very low malaria incidence (1.9 case/100 persons/year) in this study site. A calculated sporozoite rate of maximum 1/300,000 is enough to explain this low malaria incidence. Despite the successes in malaria control, the vector An. dirus A continues to play an important role in malaria transmission, whereas An. minimus A showed temporal and spatial variation in its role as vector. The role of An. sundaicus as vector could not be confirmed because of the low incidence in the coastal study village. Other Anopheles species may be locally involved, but in the five study villages where malaria is still present they probably do not contribute significantly to malaria transmission. The study also points towards the fact that in Southeast Asia it will become increasingly difficult to incriminate Anopheles species in malaria transmission while the risk for malaria transmission still persist."
CD008122,0,18667071,0,Evaluation of the genetic polymorphism of Plasmodium falciparum P126 protein (SERA or SERP) and its influence on naturally acquired specific antibody responses in malaria-infected individuals living in the Brazilian Amazon.,"The Plasmodium falciparum P126 protein is an asexual blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate antigen. Antibodies against P126 are able to inhibit parasite growth in vitro, and a major parasite-inhibitory epitope has been recently mapped to its 47 kDa N-terminal extremity (octamer repeat domain--OR domain). The OR domain basically consists of six octamer units, but variation in the sequence and number of repeat units may appear in different alleles. The aim of the present study was to investigate the polymorphism of P126 N-terminal region OR domain in P. falciparum isolates from two Brazilian malaria endemic areas and its impact on anti-OR naturally acquired antibodies."

Here, we have assessed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using recombinant L. donovani GBP (rGBP) and a peptide sequence of L. donovani GBP (GBPP) in the diagnosis of L. donovani infections in Sudan. The sensitivity of the rGBP ELISA in diagnosing visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) was 92% and 93%, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity of the GBPP ELISA was 55% for VL and 63% for PKDL. Plasma antibody reactivity of donors with VL and PKDL remained high for an extended period after the end of treatment. Antibody-reactivity to rGBP and GBPP was detected in 71% and 14% of plasma samples from CL patients, respectively. Plasma from healthy Sudanese donors living in an area endemic for malaria but free of leishmaniasis was negative in both assays."
CD008122,0,15961575,0,Effect of plasmid backbone modification by different human CpG motifs on the immunogenicity of DNA vaccine vectors.,"DNA vaccines, in general, have been found to be poorly immunogenic in nonhuman primates and humans as compared with mice. As the immunogenicity of DNA plasmids relies, to a large extent, on the presence of CpG motifs as built in adjuvants, we addressed the issue of poor immunogenicity by inserting recently identified CpG oligonucleotides (ODN) optimal for human (K-type or D-type CpG ODN) into the backbone of plasmid VR1020. We found that plasmid DNA containing K-type CpG motifs or D-type CpG motifs significantly enhanced the up-regulation of surface molecules and production of interleukin-6 from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and stimulated monocytes to develop into functionally mature dendritic cells (DC) compared with unmodified plasmid. Monocyte maturation into DC was through plasmacytoid DC present in the culture. It is interesting that the K-type CpG motif-modified plasmid stimulated significant levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma and IFN-alpha from human PBMC. Immunization of mice with D-type CpG motif-modified plasmid, encoding Plasmodium falciparum surface protein 25, yielded enhanced antigen-specific antibodies. Taken together, these results suggest that insertion of immunomodulatory human CpG motifs into plasmid DNA can improve immunogenicity of DNA vaccines."
CD008122,0,10030076,0,Standardization of procedures of Plasmodium falciparum antigen preparation for serologic tests.,"The objective of the present study is to standardize the technical variables for preparation and storage of Plasmodium falciparum and of antigen components extracted with the amphoteric detergent Zwittergent. P. falciparum obtained from in vitro culture was stored at different temperatures and for different periods of time. For each variable, antigen components of the parasite were extracted in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors and submitted or not to later dialysis. Products were stored for 15, 30 and 60 days at different temperatures and immunological activity of each extract was determined by SDS-PAGE and ELISA using positive or negative standard sera for the presence of IgG directed to blood stage antigens of P. falciparum. Antigen extracts obtained from parasites stored at -20 degrees C up to 10 days or at -70 degrees C for 2 months presented the best results, showing well-defined bands on SDS-PAGE and Western blots and presenting absorbance values in ELISA that permitted safe differentiation between positive and negative sera."

CD008122,0,12791849,1,Devices for rapid diagnosis of Malaria: evaluation of prototype assays that detect Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 and a Plasmodium vivax-specific antigen.,"The ParaSight F test was developed as a pioneer industry effort in the large-scale, process-controlled production of a device for the rapid diagnosis of malaria. This device performed well in field settings but was limited to the detection of a single malaria species, Plasmodium falciparum. The ParaSight F+V assay advanced upon the ParaSight F test format by incorporating a monoclonal antibody directed against a proprietary Plasmodium vivax-specific antigen, in addition to the antibody directed against P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2, which was used in the ParaSight F assay. The modified assay was developed to add the capability to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax in a single-test-strip format. The present study evaluated three distinct ParaSight F+V prototypes with samples from symptomatic patients in regions of Thailand and Peru where malaria is endemic. Over a 2-year enrollment period (1998 and 1999), a total of 4,894 patients consented to participation in the study. Compared with the results for duplicate microscopic examinations of Giemsa-stained blood smears as the reference diagnostic standard, each successive prototype showed substantial improvement in performance. The final ParaSight F+V prototype, evaluated in 1999, had an overall sensitivity for detection of asexual P. falciparum parasites of 98%. The sensitivity of the device was 100% for P. falciparum densities of >500 parasites/ micro l, with a sensitivity of 83% for parasite densities of </=500/ micro l. The specificity for the exclusion of P. falciparum was 93%. For P. vivax, the overall sensitivity was 87% for the final 1999 prototype. The sensitivities calculated for different levels of P. vivax parasitemia were 99% for parasite densities of >5,000/ micro l, 92% for parasite densities of 1,001 to 5,000/ micro l, 94% for parasite densities of 501 to 1,000/ micro l, and 55% for parasite densities of 1 to 500/ micro l. The specificity for the exclusion of P. vivax was 87%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the diagnostic performance of the assay for the detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax were 0.8907 and 0.8522, respectively. These findings indicate that assays for rapid diagnosis have the potential to enhance diagnostic capabilities in those instances in which skilled microscopy is not readily available."
CD008122,0,16046285,0,A new and simple solid-phase extraction method for LC determination of pyronaridine in human plasma.,"A new approach using a simple solid-phase extraction technique has been developed for the determination of pyronaridine (PND), an antimalarial drug, in human plasma. After extraction with C18 solid-phase sorbent, PND was analyzed using a reverse phase chromatographic method with fluorescence detection (at lambda(ex)=267 nm and lambda(em)=443 nm). The mean extraction recovery for PND was 95.2%. The coefficient of variation for intra-assay precision, inter-assay precision and accuracy was less than 10%. The quantification limit with fluorescence detection was 0.010 microg/mL plasma. The method described herein has several advantages over other published methods since it is easy to perform and rapid. It also permits reducing both, solvent use and sample preparation time. The method has been used successfully to assay plasma samples from clinical pharmacokinetic studies."

CD008122,0,7880093,0,Twin children in The Gambia: evidence for genetic regulation of physical characteristics in the presence of sub-optimal nutrition.,"It has been demonstrated that physical growth characteristics are subject to genetic regulation. However, in developing countries, environmental factors such as food availability and frequent infections are associated with growth faltering which is particularly marked in infancy. We have conducted anthropometric measurements of a cohort of twin children aged less than 14 years living in a rural area of The Gambia to ascertain the extent to which genetic factors influence physical growth in the presence of a sub-optimal diet. Almost 25% of the children were more than 2SD below the median of the reference population in terms of their height-for-age Z score, indicating a marked level of undernutrition. Nevertheless, the within-pair variances were significantly less for monozygous than for dizygous twin pairs for the following variables: height, head circumference and body mass index (p < 0.01); weight (p < 0.02) and mid upper arm circumference (p < 0.1), indicating that there is a strong genetic influence on growth regulation despite the sub-optimal nutrition."
CD008122,0,8418032,0,Immunoglobulin M and G antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum glutamate-rich protein: correlation with clinical immunity in Gambian children.,"The aims of the present study were to describe the age-related immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG response to part of a 220-kDa glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) from Plasmodium falciparum and to determine possible correlations of possession of these antibodies with malaria morbidity. IgM and IgG levels were measured with a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the carboxy-terminal 783 amino acids of the GLURP. Samples for the study were obtained during a longitudinal malaria morbidity survey performed in The Gambia; cross-sectional surveys were performed at the beginning of the transmission season in May and in October. Seropositivity rates increased with age to a maximum of 77% for IgM and 95% for IgG in adults. High prevalences of seropositivity were associated with certain human leukocyte antigen class II alleles (DRw8, DR9, DR7, DR4, DQw7, and DQw2) or haplotypes. The relationship between anti-GLURP489-1271 antibodies and clinical immunity is not clear; asymptomatically infected children aged 5 to 8 years had significantly higher levels of IgG than clinically ill children of the same age, suggesting that antibodies to the carboxy-terminal part of the GLURP may contribute to immunity to P. falciparum. However, this was not significant for younger children."
CD008122,0,11784420,0,The performance and utility of rapid diagnostic assays for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a field setting in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.,"Rapid diagnostic assays for malaria have the potential to improve the management and control of the disease in developing countries. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate, in a field setting, the performance of several such assays for Plasmodium falciparum infection and to examine the usefulness of these assays in identifying subjects for treatment trials in rural field sites. Residents of 12 villages in Laos who presented with fever were eligible for inclusion. Blood was collected by fingerprick for a dipstick assay, developed by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), performed and interpreted in the field by local healthcare workers. Compared with 'blinded' reference microscopy (N =196), the sensitivity and specificity of the PATH assay were 96.2% and 93.0%, respectively. Two rapid diagnostic assays (PATH and OptiMAL) were also performed on the subset of subjects eligible to participate in an in-vivo treatment trial (N = 97), and the results again compared with those of 'blinded' reference microscopy. In this subset, a subject was considered a 'true positive' if found positive by microscopy or the alternate rapid assay. Using this modified reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the PATH assay were 96.7% and 94.4%, and those of the OptiMAL assay were 91.8% and 100%, respectively. Both of the rapid assays tested therefore appear suitable for use in rural field settings by local healthcare providers and can accurately identify participants for treatment trials."
CD008122,0,2011638,0,Malaria.,"Human malaria is caused by four species of the genus plasmodium. The sexual stage of the parasite occurs in the mosquito and asexual reproduction occurs in man. Symptoms of fever, chills, headache, and myalgia result from the invasion and rupture of erythrocytes. Merozoites are released from erythrocytes and invade other cells, thus propagating the infection. The most vulnerable hosts are nonimmune travelers, young children living in the tropics, and pregnant women. P. falciparum causes the most severe infections because it infects RBCs of all ages and has the propensity to develop resistance to antimalarials. Rapid diagnosis can be made with a malarial smear, and treatment should be initiated promptly. In some regions (Mexico, Central America except Panama, and North Africa) chloroquine phosphate is effective therapy. In subsaharan Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia, chloroquine resistance has become widespread, and other antimalarials are necessary. The primary care physician should have a high index of suspicion for malaria in the traveler returning from the tropics. Malaria should also be suspected in the febrile transfusion recipient and newborns of mothers with malaria."
CD008122,0,10066659,0,Immunoglobulin subclass distribution and diagnostic value of Leishmania donovani antigen-specific immunoglobulin G3 in Indian kala-azar patients.,"Visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar, a fatal tropical disease, remains problematic, as early diagnosis is difficult and treatment often results in drug resistance and relapse. We have developed a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using leishmanial membrane antigenic extracts (LAg) to detect specific antibody responses in 25 untreated Indian visceral leishmaniasis patients. To investigate the pathogenetic significance of isotype markers in kala-azar, relative levels of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgG subclasses were analyzed under clinically established diseased conditions. Since LAg showed higher sensitivity for specific IgG than lysate, the immunoglobulin isotype responses were evaluated, with LAg as antigen. Compared to 60 controls, which included patients with malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, and typhoid and healthy subjects, visceral leishmaniasis patients showed significantly higher IgG (100% sensitivity, 85% specificity), IgM (48% sensitivity, 100% specificity), and IgE (44% sensitivity, 98.3% specificity) responses. Low levels of IgA in visceral leishmaniasis patients contrasted with a 13-fold-higher reactivity in sera from patients with leprosy. Among IgG subclasses, IgG1, -3, and -4 responses were significantly higher in visceral leishmaniasis patients than in the controls. IgG2 response, however, was significantly higher (twofold) in leprosy than even visceral leishmaniasis patients. The rank orders for sensitivity (IgG = IgG1 = IgG3 = IgG4 > IgG2 > IgM > IgE > IgA) and specificity (IgM = IgG3 > IgE > IgG4 > IgG2 > IgG > IgG1 > IgA) for LAg-specific antibody responses suggest the potentiality of IgG3 as a diagnostic marker for visceral leishmaniasis."
CD008122,0,10432050,0,Polyclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha Fab used as an ancillary treatment for severe malaria.,"Single doses (250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 units/kg) of an ovine polyclonal-specific Fab fragment directed against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were given to 17 adult patients with severe falciparum malaria immediately before treatment with artesunate in a pilot study to assess safety and optimal dosage with a view to future studies. Clinical and laboratory variables were compared with 11 controls. In the groups given Fab, there was a tendency for a faster resolution of clinical manifestations and reduction of fever but also a tendency towards longer parasite clearance times. Adverse events were more common in the control group and no early anaphylactic or late serum sickness reactions occurred in the Fab treated patients. On admission all patients had markedly elevated levels of TNF-alpha (85-1,532 ng/L) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (30-27,500 ng/L). Also, 86% had elevated interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels, 75% had increased IL-2 levels, 36% had increased IL-8 levels, and 21% had increased IL-1beta levels. Antibody treatment reduced IFN-gamma concentrations in a dose-related manner, but had no obvious effects on levels of other cytokines in this small study, although unbound TNF-alpha was undetectable after Fab treatment. Circulating concentrations of soluble E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were not affected by Fab treatment. The Fab exhibited a two-compartment, dose-proportional kinetics with an average elimination half-life of 12.0 hr, with about 20% being excreted renally. These results encourage a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with cerebral malaria and provide some guidance about dosage."

CD008122,0,12010968,0,Regulation of antigen-specific immunoglobulin G subclasses in response to conserved and polymorphic Plasmodium falciparum antigens in an in vitro model.,"Cytophilic antibodies (Abs) play a critical role in protection against Plasmodium falciparum blood stages, yet little is known about the parameters regulating production of these Abs. We used an in vitro culture system to study the subclass distribution of antigen (Ag)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals exposed to P. falciparum or unexposed individuals. PBMCs, cultivated with or without cytokines and exogenous CD40/CD40L signals, were stimulated with a crude parasite extract, recombinant vaccine candidates derived from conserved Ags (19-kDa C terminus of merozoite surface protein 1 [MSP1(19)], R23, and PfEB200), or recombinant Ags derived from the polymorphic Ags MSP1 block 2 and MSP2. No P. falciparum-specific Ab production was detected in PBMCs from unexposed individuals. PBMCs from donors exposed frequently to P. falciparum infections produced multiple IgG subclasses when they were stimulated with the parasite extract but usually only one IgG subclass when they were stimulated with a recombinant Ag. Optimal Ab production required addition of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-10 for all antigenic preparations. The IgG subclass distribution was both donor and Ag dependent and was only minimally influenced by the exogenous cytokine environment. In vitro IgG production and subclass distribution correlated with plasma Abs to some Ags (MSP1(19), R23, and MSP2) but not others (PfEB200 and the three MSP1 block 2-derived Ags). Data presented here suggest that intrinsic properties of the protein Ag itself play a major role in determining the subclass of the Ab response, which has important implications for rational design of vaccine delivery."
CD008122,0,7631143,0,Comparison of the number of IL-4 and IFN-gamma secreting cells in response to the malaria vaccine candidate antigen Pf155/RESA in two groups of naturally primed individuals living in a malaria endemic area in Burkina Faso.,"The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was used to enumerate the number of IFN-gamma and IL-4 producing cells after in vitro stimulation with a highly purified recombinant malaria vaccine candidate antigen (r-Pf155/RESA) or synthetic peptides corresponding to its major T-cell epitopes. Two groups of naturally primed individuals living in rural areas of Burkina Faso were studied. The donors comprised one group of healthy (non-parasitemic) mainly adult people and one parasitemic mainly younger people. IL-4 producing cells were detected in response to PHA but no such cells were detected in response to the malarial antigens. The most frequent IFN-gamma responses were seen with r-Pf155/RESA. Thus, after stimulation with this antigen 52% of the donors responded positively in the ELISPOT assay, while only 17% responded to the synthetic peptides, suggesting that the rPf155/RESA contained T-cell epitopes not covered by the peptides used in this study. The number of IFN-gamma producing cells in response to the malarial antigens did not differ between the two groups. However, IFN-gamma levels found in sera from the parasitemic individuals were significantly higher than in those from healthy donors. This latter finding and the lack of differences seen in the number of IFN-gamma producing spots in the two groups indicate that IFN-gamma producing cells may have sequestered to other organs in the parasitemic group."

CD008122,0,9988333,1,Immunocapture diagnostic assays for malaria using Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH).,"We have developed two diagnostic assays based on the specific detection of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) activity. These assays exploit a panel of monoclonal antibodies that capture the parasite enzyme and allow for the quantitation and speciation of human malaria infections. An immunocapture pLDH activity assay (ICpLDH) allows for the rapid purification and measurement of pLDH from infected blood using the NAD analog APAD, which reacts specifically with Plasmodium LDH isoforms. An immunochromatographic test (the OptiMAL assay) was also formatted and allowed the detection of parasite infections of approximately 200 parasites/microl of blood. By using a combination of antibodies, both tests can not only detect but differentiate between P. falciparum and non-P. falciparum malaria. Both assays show a sensitivity comparable with other commercial nonmicroscopic tests; importantly, we found very few instances of false-positive samples, especially with samples from patients recently cleared of malaria infection. Furthermore, we find that when one uses the quantitative ICpLDH assay, the levels of pLDH activity closely mirror the levels of parasitemia in both initial diagnosis and while following patient therapy. We conclude that diagnostic tests based on the detection of pLDH are both sensitive and practical for the detection, speciation, and quantitation of all human Plasmodium infections and can also be used to indicate drug-resistant infections."

We therefore developed a histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based drug sensitivity assay for testing of fresh isolates of Plasmodium falciparum in the field. In contrast to the HRP2 laboratory assay, the field assay uses a procedure that further simplifies the handling and culturing of malaria parasites by omitting centrifugation, washing, the use of serum, and dilution with uninfected red blood cells. A total of 40 fresh Plasmodium falciparum isolates were successfully tested for their susceptibility to dihydroartemisinin, mefloquine, quinine, and chloroquine (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 3.43, 61.89, 326.75, and 185.31 nM, respectively). Results very closely matched those obtained with a modified World Health Organization schizont maturation assay (R2 = 0.96, P < 0.001; mean log difference at IC50 = 0.054)."
CD008122,0,11513554,0,Detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Wuchereria bancrofti infected blood samples using multiplex PCR.,"A rapid and sensitive multiplex PCR has been developed for the diagnosis of multiple parasitic infection in human blood. Infection is detected by a single multiplex PCR reaction containing two pairs of oligonucleotide primers whereby each primer is specific for each parasite species. These primer sets amplified 400 and 450-bp fragments for Wuchereria bancrofti and 208-bp fragment for Plasmodium falciparum. The PCR products derived from each parasite species were visualized in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, therefore allowing the rapid identification of any, or all, of the two human parasites, if present, in a single amplification reaction. This multiplex PCR was very sensitive with the ability to detect the presence of as little as 10 pg of parasite DNA. The primers used in this multiplex PCR also showed highly specific amplification of each respective parasite DNA without the presence of non-specific and non-target PCR products. This multiplex PCR system was used to analyse 36 human blood samples of Myanmar workers in the endemic area at Tak Province, Thailand. Two samples showed the multiple infection, 27 samples were either infected with W. bancrofti or P. falciparum and seven samples were negative for both methods. The high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity of this multiplex PCR method make it suitable for large-scale epidemiological studies and following of drug treatment."
CD008122,0,11198397,0,Serological investigation of malaria outbreak in Thar desert of Rajasthan.,"A serological investigation by a repeat cross-sectional survey was conducted in Thar desert (Rajasthan) during and after one year of malaria outbreak to determine malaria endemicity using ELISA as a tool. The assay was based on indirect ELISA to measure antibody levels against a nonapeptide R1 (EENVEHDA-cys) derived from Pf 155/Resa and Plasmodium falciparum crude antigen. Finger prick blood samples were collected from individuals belonging to all age groups. Sera were tested at already standardized optimum dilution to detect antigen specific immunoglobulin isotype. The mean ELISA O.D. values 0.153 for anti R1 peptide and 0.162 for anti Pf antigen reflected the seronegative profile, when the focal malaria outbreak occurred in 1994. A substantial increase in antibody levels was detected in individuals after one year showing mean ELISA values for anti-R1 and anti-Pf antigens as 0.52 and 0.58 and seropositivity as 75.2% and 52% respectively. Data obtained from the present study indicate that serological survey could be done to assess the situation in case of reappearing or disappearing status of malaria in a defined population."
CD008122,0,9735270,0,The optimal production of gametocytes by Plasmodium falciparum.,"We use a simple model of the blood-stage infection dynamics of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to consider the adaptive significance of different rates of conversion from its pathogenic, asexual stages to its transmissible, sexual forms. We find that maximize transmissivity in single-strain infections are generally greater than the highest rates reported for in vitro cultures and are several times those for which the behavior of the model is consistent with clinical profiles of infection dynamics. When two strains that share a common immune agent coinfect a host through simultaneous inoculation or sequential superinfection, however, a strain with a lower, clinically-consistent value of the conversion rate inhibits the transmissivity of one with the higher value optimal for single-strain infection. Hence we suggest that ""apparent"" competition by way of a common immune response might be responsible for selection of the former."
CD008122,0,9229019,0,Synthetic polypeptides corresponding to the non-repeat regions from the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum: recognition by human T-cells and immunogenicity in owl monkeys.,"Synthetic polypeptides encompassing the non-repeated regions of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum are very immunogenic in mice and are recognized by sera from donors living in regions where malaria is endemic, both in Africa and South America. Long polypeptides, encompassing the N- or C-terminal regions, have now been used to demonstrate peptide-specific T cells in donors living in an endemic area of Colombia. Although the N-terminal peptide (22-125) was recognized almost exclusively by donors from the endemic area, the patterns of recognition of the C-terminal peptide (289-390) in donors from endemic and non-endemic areas were similar and like the pattern with smaller peptides. The availability of the long polypeptides made it possible to compare T-cell responses to the non-repeated regions of the CSP with the presence of peptide-specific antibodies. No correlation was found and no antibodies were detected in donors from non-endemic regions. The long polypeptides also elicited strong antibody and T-cell responses in owl monkeys (Aotus lemurinus). The antibodies generated against the synthetic peptides in such monkeys also recognized sporozoites, the natural infective form of the parasite. The results emphasise the potential of the peptides tested as malaria-vaccine candidates. Not only are they recognized by humans at both the B- and T-cell level but they also elicit strong responses in monkeys and encompass several distinct T-cell epitopes, thus overcoming the limitations of specific, major-histocompatibility-complex restriction."
CD008122,0,15331837,0,Act now or later? Economics of malaria resistance.,"In the past, malaria control efforts in sub-Saharan Africa have relied on a combination of vector control with effective treatment using chloroquine. With increasing resistance to chloroquine, attention has now turned to alternative treatment strategies to replace this failing drug. Some countries have already changed their official first-line treatment to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, while others are contemplating a switch to artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs). Although there are strong theoretical arguments in favor of switching to ACTs, the validity of these arguments in the face of financial constraints has not been previously analyzed. In this report, we use a bioeconomic model of malaria transmission and evolution of drug resistance to examine questions of optimal treatment strategy and coverage when drug resistance places an additional constraint on choices available to the policymaker."

However, additional analysis is required to determine the optimal form of public intervention, and how to set priorities. Additional criteria of cost-effectiveness, impact on poverty and catastrophic expenditures, affordability, characteristics of supply and demand, and potential for leakage are invoked to help inform decision making in the field of malaria control policies. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between public and private actions."

CD008122,0,8344409,0,Plasmodium falciparum: analysis of the cytoadherence inhibition of the human monoclonal antibody 33G2 and of antibodies reactive with antigen Pf332.,"The capacity of a human monoclonal antibody (MAb 33G2) to interfere in vitro both with Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion and cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to melanoma cells has been reported. MAb 33G2 cross-reacts with several P. falciparum antigens but shows highest reactivity with repeated sequences in the asexual blood stage antigen Pf332. This study was conducted in order to further analyze the cytoadherence inhibition mediated by MAb 33G2 and to evaluate the relative contribution of antibodies to Pf332 in the inhibitory activity of immunoglobulins from P. falciparum immune donors. We show here that MAb 33G2 inhibits cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes (PRBCs) with similar efficiency independently of the strain of parasite, while the inhibitory capacity of immunoglobulin fractions from Liberian immune donors was restricted to some strains only. There appears to be no correlation between the reactivity with Pf332 of immunoglobulin preparations from different donors and their capacity to inhibit cytoadherence of PRBCs to melanoma cells. In contrast to MAb 33G2, polyclonal antibodies affinity purified on the Pf332 peptide containing the epitope seen by the MAb showed little or no inhibition of cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes."

Paired sera from patients recovering from malaria (Group IV) as well as sera from blood donors were also tested. In the PGI test, sera were tested against three uncloned isolates of P. falciparum comprising SO, I4 and AE9 (PGI-SO, PGI-I4 and PGI-AE9 respectively). When growth inhibition of greater than or equal to 30% against any one of the three isolates was considered positive, the positive rate for the combined Groups I, II and III was 78.7%. Further analysis showed that the positive rates for PGI-SO, PGI-I4 and PGI-AE9 were 63.8%, 59.5% and 59.5% respectively and were not significantly different (p greater than 0.05). Comparison between PGI-SO, PGI-I4 and PGI-AE9 activities of Groups I, II and III sera showed no significant differences in any comparison groups except with PGI-AE9 in which Group III sera were more frequently positive than Group II sera (p = 0.004). Follow-up of PGI-SO and PGI-AE9 activities in Group IV patients showed mostly a decrease or no change in the activities of the convalescent sera taken 63 days later. RESA-IFA positive rate in the combined Groups I, II and III sera was 91.7%. There were no significant differences either in the seropositive rates or in the geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) between Groups I, II and III sera. Follow-up in Group IV patients showed no change in antibody titers in 64% of cases, decrease and increase in titers in 29% and 7% of cases respectively. The urease-ELISA seropositive rate in the combined Groups (I, II and III) was 89.5% which is not significantly different from that of RESA-IFA (p greater than 0.05). Comparison between individual Groups (I, II and III) likewise showed no significant differences in both GMT and seropositive rates. Follow-up in Group IV sera showed either no change or a decrease in antibody titers in 55.6% and 44.4% of cases respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008122,0,6418767,0,Development and application of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the quantitation of alternative complement pathway activation in human serum.,"We have developed a new, specific, and highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which quantitates activation of the alternative pathway in human serum, plasma, or on the surface of activators. The ELISA detects the third component of complement (C3b), proteolytic fragment of complement Factor B (Bb), and properdin (P) complex or its derivative product, C3b,P. In the method, activator-plasma mixtures, plasma containing an activated alternative pathway, or other samples are added to the wells of microtitration plates precoated with antibody to P. C3b, Bb,P or C3b,P complexes which become bound are quantitated by subsequently added, enzyme-labeled, anti-C3. The resulting hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate is expressed as nanograms of C3b by reference to a C3 standard curve. In addition to absolute specificity for activation of the pathway because of the nature of the complex detected by the assay, the ELISA is highly sensitive and able to reproducibly detect 10-20 ng/ml of C3b,P complexes in serum. This value corresponds to 0.0015% of the C3 in serum. In a series of studies to validate the parameters of the ELISA, reactivity was found to be dependent on the presence of alternative pathway proteins, the functional integrity of the pathway, and on the presence of magnesium. Sheep erythrocytes were converted to activators by treatment with neuraminidase. By using a variety of activators, the kinetics of activation and the numbers of bound C3b molecules quantitated by the ELISA were very similar to those measured by C3b deposition. The ELISA also detected identical activation kinetics when MgEGTA-serum and a mixture of the purified alternative pathway proteins were used as sources of the pathway. ELISA reaction kinetics also correlated with the restriction index, a measure of alternative pathway-activating ability. These studies cumulatively validate the ELISA as a direct and quantitative assay for alternative pathway activation. The sensitivity of the ELISA has permitted its use to detect direct alternative pathway activation by several viruses. The ELISA has also shown that certain classical pathway activators trigger the amplification loop of the alternative pathway while others do not. In addition, stable ELISA reactive complexes appeared in the supernatant of mixtures of serum with certain, but not other activators. The ability of the ELISA to detect activation which has already occurred and the stability of the reactive complexes permits studies of clinical sera. Normal human sera (20) contained low levels (5-20 ng/ml) of ELISA-reactive complexes. A proportion of sera from individuals with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (9-10), typhoid fever (8-10), malaria (3-5), gram-negative sepsis (9 of 47), acute trauma and shock (6 f 25), and systemic lupus erythematosus (3 of 29) showed elevated levels of complexes reactive in the alternative pathway ELISA. In contrast, nine sera from patients with circulating C3 nephritic factor were not reactive in the ELISA."

In the second trial, 35 other volunteers received the vaccine with placebo (group 4), 0.25 x 10(6) (group 5), or 1.0 x 10(6) IU (group 6) of interferon-gamma (= IFN-gamma). Immunizations were well tolerated and resulted in seroconversion rates (greater than or equal to 4-fold increase of antibody titre in immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) of 67-100% of volunteers. IFN-alpha significantly enhanced the IgG antibody titres in ELISA to malaria peptide."

The results obtained were also compared with the results of standard microscopic examination. A total of 150 cases were included for the study. Fifty cases were non-febrile cases with no history of malaria acting as control group and the rest 100 cases were having fever and formed the test group. All the cases in the control group was found to be negative for both microscopic examination and strip test. In the test group, all samples that showed positive for P. falciparum by microscopy was also found to be positive for strip test. Whereas, all those samples that were positive for P. vivax in microscopic examination was found to be negative for strip test indicating species specificity of the strip test.

CD008122,0,18593340,0,Prevalence and pattern of cross-reacting antibodies to HIV in patients with tuberculosis.,"In many countries, HIV testing among tuberculosis (TB) patients is recommended so that both infections are appropriately treated. Cross-reacting antibodies to HIV antigens have been reported for several conditions, including TB, leprosy, malaria, and rheumatoid arthritis. To study the pattern and prevalence of cross-reacting antibodies to HIV antigens, we examined sera from 153 HIV-negative TB patients and 40 healthy individuals in Chennai, south India. We also studied the differences in cross-reactivity of various HIV antigens using two different Western blot kits. Of the 153 samples studied, 80 were tested using HIV Western blot and 73 were tested using INNOLIA. Most patients in the study had concordantly negative ELISA and rapid tests, and no subject had a positive Western blot. However, seven TB patients had antibodies that cross-reacted with HIV antigens, giving rise to an indeterminate result. While p51/55 was the most frequently recognized antigen in the Western blot assay, antibodies to sgp120 was most frequently identified in INNOLIA. Sequence similarities between the two organisms could be responsible for eliciting cross-reacting antibodies, since a few related epitopes were identified in HIV and Mycobacterium. These findings could have potential implications for the development of diagnostics and vaccines."

The model system was based on human T cell clones specific for the recombinant malaria protein 190L, which was expressed fused to beta-galactosidase in lambda gt11. Several membranes were tested for their capacity to bind antigen and stimulate T cell proliferation. Pretreatment of membranes with DMSO and/or sonication to release the antigen improved the sensitivity of the assay. Under optimal conditions, T cell proliferation in response to antigen bound to a low protein binder membrane was comparable to that observed with the antigen in solution. A dot-blot type apparatus was designed for screening large numbers of plaques with T cells. The technical problems of this approach, its requirements and possible applications are discussed."

The QBC technique is useful for rapid screening and thin smear is necessary for Plasmodium identification and parasitaemia determination. The two complementary methods provide rapid and efficient diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas as well as control of parasitaemia following therapy."
CD008122,0,11791965,0,"Confirmation of Anopheles varuna in vietnam, previously misidentified and mistargeted as the malaria vector Anopheles minimus.","Malaria control programs in Southeast Asia are faced with several questions concerning vector behavior and species identification, which need to be answered to consolidate and further improve the results of control practices. The vector system in Southeast Asia is complex because of the number of species potentially involved in malaria transmission. Additionally, the follow-up and evaluation of preventive control measures are hampered by the misidentification of vectors due to overlapping morphological characters of the female mosquitoes. In central Vietnam, control practices are aimed at 2 main species, Anopheles dirus s.l. and Anopheles minimus s.l. These reputed vectors were studied in an area of Binh Thuan Province of south-central Vietnam. Different collection methods were used to capture mosquitoes quarterly during a 1-year period. Mosquitoes were identified in the field and later subjected to detailed morphological examination and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. What was thought to be an unusual morphotype of An. minimus was shown to be Anopheles varuna, and most specimens identified as the former species in the field proved to be the latter species. Very few An. minimus individuals were found during the study period. The population of An. varuna was found to be highly zoophilic, and based on this behavior, it cannot be considered a vector in Vietnam. Because this species was previously being misidentified as An. minimus, a nonvector was mistargeted as a malaria vector in Binh Thuan Province. Anopheles dirus, which was found positive for Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, is clearly the main vector in this area. Despite the fact that several potential secondary vectors were found during the study, the primary target for vector control in the region should be An. dirus."
CD008122,0,394408,0,Chromosomal differentiation and adaptation to human environments in the Anopheles gambiae complex.,"Speciation in the Anopheles gambiae complex is reviewed and discussed with emphasis on the patterns of chromosomal differentiation, particularly at the intraspecific level. The significance of inversion polymorphism in gambiae and arabiensis (the two species of greatest medical importance) is evaluated with reference to recent field investigations carried out in Nigeria. In both sibling species some of the inversions show clinical geographical changes in frequencies, with evident correlations with climatic conditions and vegetation zones. Microgeographical variations in species distribution and in intraspecific inversion frequencies are also present, which appear mostly related to man-made environmental contrasts. Parallel indoor-/outdoor collections of samples from polymorphic populations of arabiensis and gambiae show that adult mosquitoes carrying certain inversion karyotypes do not distribute at random in relation to the human environment, being significantly more frequent in outdoor than in indoor samples, or vice-versa. Optimal habitat choice appears to be involved in such variations of indoor resting behaviour, since the chromosomal types carried by less endophilic individuals are those more adapted to humid climates, i.e. those which tend to avoid the higher nocturnal saturation deficit of the indoor environment. This phenomenon, producing non-uniform exposure of the vector population to residual insecticides sprayed in houses, might explain the mediocrity of the results of malaria control projects based on house-spraying against endophilic vectors in the African savannas."
CD008122,0,15350520,0,Quantitative Plasmodium sporozoite neutralization assay (TSNA).,"The circumsporozoite (CS) protein is the major surface protein of Plasmodium sporozoites. Antibodies to the immunodominant repeat domain of CS immobilize sporozoites and prevent infection of hepatocytes. Plasmodium falciparum vaccines containing CS repeats are undergoing human trials in endemic areas, and proof of efficacy has been obtained. The correlates of protection are under investigation. Levels of anti-repeat antibodies in the serum of the human volunteers have been measured mostly by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IFA. Assays that measure the effect of the serum antibodies on parasite infectivity (serum neutralization assays SNAs) are not usually performed because they require a susceptible host and P. falciparum sporozoites are highly infectious only to humans. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new assay named transgenic sporozoite neutralization assay (TSNA) that uses as neutralization target, a transgenic rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei that bears the P. falciparum CS repeats [CS(Pf)]. Following incubation with human serum, CS(Pf) infectivity of HepG2 cells is evaluated by real-time PCR. We have compared ELISA titers and TSNAs in a limited number of sera from humans immunized with (T1B)4 MAP, a peptide vaccine containing P. falciparum CS repeats. A comparison between the two assays did not reach significance (p=0.175) when analyzed by non-parametric Spearman correlation method. Ongoing human trials of CS-based vaccines should provide an opportunity to determine whether TSNAs will provide better correlates of protective immunity than ELISA assays."

In this study, we show, using an in vitro assay, that part of these antibodies are involved with blocking the re-invasion of host red blood cells by erythrocytic merozoites. One hundred consecutive paired maternal-cord blood samples were collected at delivery and their plasma assayed for total IgG antibodies against crude blood stage antigens by the ELISA. The Ig fraction were precipitated from the plasma samples with (NH(4))(2)SO(4), purified on PD10 columns and used in vitro in determining the re-invasion inhibitory capacities. The mean (+/-SD) ELISA OD(405) IgG antibodies to crude blood stage antigens of maternal (0.476 +/- 0.48) and cord (0.421 +/- 0.39) plasma samples was not significantly different. However, the mean total protein concentration of the Ig fractions for maternal samples (15.82 +/- 3.85) was significantly higher (p=0.005) than that of paired cord samples (12.87 +/- 2.86 mg/ml). There was no correlation between anti-Plasmodium falciparum-specific IgG levels and total protein concentrations of the Ig fractions of both maternal and cord samples. The entire test Ig fractions were strongly inhibitory (>50 per cent) except for four paired maternal cord samples, which were moderately inhibitory (21--50 per cent) at the highest concentration tested (1:2 dilution). Furthermore, there was no correlation between maternal IgG levels and percentage re-invasion inhibition at the 1:2 dilution. The results suggest that mothers resident in malaria endemic areas possess naturally acquired re-invasion inhibitory antibodies and their foetuses can acquire these antibodies transplacentally, which may contribute to the relative protection observed in infants during their first few weeks of life."

XIII. Asembo Bay Cohort Project.","The present study was initiated to characterize antibody responses to repetitive epitopes of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), liver stage antigen-1 (LSA-1), and merozoite surface protein-2 (MSP-2) of Plasmodium falciparum in infants residing in a P. falciparum-hyperendemic area of western Kenya. In this study, development and maintenance of these antibody responses in 28 infants were studied longitudinally by use of monthly serum samples collected from birth to age 1 year. Mother plasma and infant umbilical cord plasma were also tested to assess the transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies. Results showed that antibodies passively transferred from mothers were detectable for CSP, LSA-1, and MSP-2 repeat epitopes. Infants were able to mount and maintain a strong antibody response against LSA-1 in their first year of life. Infants often responded to CSP repeats, but with a much lower antibody titer. Antibody responses in infants against Fc27 and 3D7 repeats of MSP-2 were low throughout their first year. In addition, 51 infants whose first detected infection occurred at > 4 months of age were selected to determine antibody responses to the antigens tested upon their first and second detected infections. Antibody responses to LSA-1 and, to a lesser degree, CSP increased in positivity rates and titer upon second infection. Antibody responses to Fc27-type and 3D7-type repeats of MSP-2 were low upon both infections. There was no association between maternally transferred anti-LSA-1, anti-CSP, or anti-MSP-2 antibodies and an infant's first detected infection. No significant correlation was found between an infant's antibody responses to the 4 antigen repetitive epitopes and protection against malarial parasitemia during the first year of life."
CD008122,0,17049572,0,Minimising human error in malaria rapid diagnosis: clarity of written instructions and health worker performance.,"The usefulness of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) in malaria case management depends on the accuracy of the diagnoses they provide. Despite their apparent simplicity, previous studies indicate that RDT accuracy is highly user-dependent. As malaria RDTs will frequently be used in remote areas with little supervision or support, minimising mistakes is crucial. This paper describes the development of new instructions (job aids) to improve health worker performance, based on observations of common errors made by remote health workers and villagers in preparing and interpreting RDTs, in the Philippines and Laos. Initial preparation using the instructions provided by the manufacturer was poor, but improved significantly with the job aids (e.g. correct use both of the dipstick and cassette increased in the Philippines by 17%). However, mistakes in preparation remained commonplace, especially for dipstick RDTs, as did mistakes in interpretation of results. A short orientation on correct use and interpretation further improved accuracy, from 70% to 80%. The results indicate that apparently simple diagnostic tests can be poorly performed and interpreted, but provision of clear, simple instructions can reduce these errors. Preparation of appropriate instructions and training as well as monitoring of user behaviour are an essential part of rapid test implementation."
CD008122,0,3299224,0,Plasmodium falciparum-inhibitory monoclonal antibodies produced by human hybridomas.,"Stable human hybridomas were generated that produced inhibitory anti-Plasmodium falciparum monoclonal antibodies. Peripheral blood lymphocytes, obtained from adults in Liberia, a malaria endemic area, were immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus and then fused with KR4, a human, lymphoblastoid cell line. Stable hybridomas that produced anti-P. falciparum monoclonal antibody were identified by an ELISA assay that used the trophozoite and schizont antigens of both the Honduras I and FCR3 parasite strains. Monoclonal antibodies produced by selected hybridomas derived from lymphocytes of two individuals were subsequently studied. The anti-parasite antibodies were produced at 1-3 micrograms/ml in culture supernatants. All of the monoclonal antibodies bound specifically to trophozoites and schizonts of both strains of parasite in an indirect immunofluorescence assay and inhibited production of ring stage parasites by more than 90% when added to trophozoite or schizont containing erythrocytes in culture. Western immunoblot analysis of antigens obtained from trophozoites and schizonts (parasite age span of 36 to 48 h) was performed using either affinity purified or ammonium sulfate-concentrated monoclonal antibody. Antibody from three hybridomas which bound primarily to antigens of the Honduras 1 strain had Mr of approximately 140,000, 130,000 and 123,000."
CD008122,0,16138310,0,Molecular diagnosis of inherited disorders: lessons from hemoglobinopathies.,"Hemoglobinopathies constitute a major health problem worldwide, with a high carrier frequency, particularly in certain regions where malaria has been endemic. These disorders are characterized by a vast clinical and hematological phenotypic heterogeneity. Over 1,200 different genetic alterations that affect the DNA sequence of the human alpha-like (HBZ, HBA2, HBA1, and HBQ1) and beta-like (HBE1, HBG2, HBG1, HBD, and HBB) globin genes are mainly responsible for the observed clinical heterogeneity. These mutations, together with detailed information about the resulting phenotype, are documented in the globin locus-specific HbVar database. Family studies and comprehensive hematological analyses provide useful insights for accurately diagnosing thalassemia at the DNA level. For this purpose, numerous techniques can provide accurate, rapid, and cost-effective identification of the underlying genetic defect in affected individuals. The aim of this article is to review the diverse methodological and technical platforms available for the molecular diagnosis of inherited disorders, using thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies as a model. This article also attempts to shed light on issues closely related to thalassemia diagnostics, such as prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnoses and genetic counseling, for better-quality disease management."

A total of 55 patients had S. typhi cultured from their blood, 20 had S. typhi cultured from their stool, 24 were blood or stool culture positive for S. paratyphi A, 41 were culture negative but clinically diagnosed as having enteric fever, 41 had gastrointestinal or urinary tract infections, 41 were clinically diagnosed as having malaria, 20 were smear-positive patients with malaria, 58 had respiratory infections, and the remaining 39 individuals were placed in a miscellaneous group who did not have Salmonella infection. The sensitivities of the indirect IgG ELISA, indirect IgM ELISA, and IgM capture ELISA determined with specimens obtained from the blood culture-positive patients with typhoid fever (positive controls) were 80, 64, and 62%, respectively. The specificities of the assays determined with sera from the patients with respiratory infections (negative controls) were 95, 95, and 97%, respectively. The percentage of smear-positive patients with malaria who were positive by these assays was lower than that in the negative control group. The percentages of individuals in the other patient categories who were positive by these tests were between those obtained with the positive and negative controls. Of the positive controls, 26 were positive by both IgM assays, 9 were IgM positive only by indirect ELISA, and 8 were IgM positive only by IgM capture ELISA. A total of 70% of the positive control patients who were tested for O agglutinins by the Widal tube agglutination assay were positive; however, 29% of the negative control patients were also positive.

CD008122,0,16679041,0,Cerebral malaria is associated with IgG2 and IgG4 antibody responses to recombinant Plasmodium falciparum RIFIN antigen.,"RIFIN proteins belong to the largest Plasmodium falciparum multicopy family of variant surface antigens (VSA) expressed by infected erythrocytes. VSA antibodies have been shown to be associated with protection against malaria. Here, antibody subclass responses to a recombinant RIFIN protein (RIF-29) in 116 Ghanaian children were determined by ELISA to investigate the relationship between severe malaria and anti-RIF-29 antibodies. The study group was composed of 23 children diagnosed exclusively for cerebral malaria and 35 children who had non-cerebral severe malaria. The remaining 58 individuals were age-, gender- and area-matched asymptomatic controls. The finding that IgG1 and IgG3 responses predominated in severe malaria patients compared to matched controls suggests that these antibodies are not protective, but are most probably induced by a current infection, an observation substantiated by the equally high reactivity to both recombinant RIF-29 protein and to P. falciparum crude lysate proteins. The exclusive detection of IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies to RIF-29 protein only in cerebral malaria children brings to mind the possibility that these antibodies are pathogenic. This is a new finding that may go some way towards explaining why these children are at risk of developing the life-threatening form of cerebral malaria."
CD008122,0,15361247,0,Does malaria suffer from lack of memory?,"It is widely perceived that immunity to malaria is, to an extent, defective and that one component of this defective immune response is the inability to induce or maintain long-term memory responses. If true, this is likely to pose problems for development of an effective vaccine against malaria. In this article, we critically review and challenge this interpretation of the epidemiological and experimental evidence. While evasion and modulation of host immune responses clearly occurs and naturally acquired immunity is far from optimal, mechanisms to control blood-stage parasites are acquired and maintained by individuals living in endemic areas, allowing parasite density to be kept below the threshold for induction of acute disease. Furthermore, protective immunity to severe pathology is achieved relatively rapidly and is maintained in the absence of boosting by re-infection. Nevertheless, there are significant challenges to overcome. The need for multiple infections to acquire immunity means that young children remain at risk of infection for far too long. Persistent or frequent exposure to antigen seems to be required to maintain anti-parasite immunity (premunition). Lastly, pre-erythrocytic and sexual stages of the life cycle are poorly immunogenic, and there is little evidence of effective pre-erythrocytic or transmission-blocking immunity at the population level. While these problems might theoretically be due to defective immunological memory, we suggest alternative explanations. Moreover, we question the extent to which these problems are malaria-specific rather than generic (i.e. result from inherent limitations of the vertebrate immune system)."
CD008122,0,11288997,0,Characterization of specific monoclonal antibodies for detection of mefloquine in body fluids.,"Specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to mefloquine conjugated to bovine serum albumin (mefloquine-BSA) were produced by hybridoma technology. The mefloquine-BSA was synthesized by converting mefloquine into hemisuccinate followed by convalently linked to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and coupling with N,N' disuccinimidyl carbonate (DSC). The conjugate was purified by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration using 0.01 M PBS pH 7.2. An average of 19.34 molecules of mefloquine were conjugated to each molecule of protein determined by differential UV absorption spectra of hapten and protein carrier. Sixteen monoclones producing antibody specific to mefloquine were screened by indirect ELISA using homologous antigens. The specificity of MAbs was determined by reacting with BSA and the structurally related antimalarial drug, quinine. Three, three, five and two MAbs belonged to IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, respectively. Most of the MAbs slightly reacted with quinine-BSA due to the closely related structure of mefloquine to quinine. The selected MAb designated 11F9(G5)G9 which showed no cross reaction with quinine-BSA gave high reactivity with blood samples from malaria patients previously treated with mefloquine when compared to normal blood by indirect ELISA. The preliminary results indicated that such specific MAb could be used as antibody probe for detection of mefloquine in biological fluids."

Serologic studies.","Parasitaemia and antimalarial antibodies were examined from May 1983 to March 1984 in monthly samples taken from 930 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Saradidi, Kenya, and 317 of their infants; 104 women were taking chloroquine phosphate 300 mg base weekly for chemoprophylaxis. Seropositivity rates in pregnant women were uniformly high, and mean enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) absorbance values were not related to presence of parasitaemia or history of chemoprophylaxis. Parasitaemia was present in 26.5% of 1677 slides from pregnant women and there was little variation by month of sample. Mean ELISA absorbance values varied by month of sample. Seropositivity rates in infants were high as measured in both the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test (81.6% of 938) and ELISA at 1:100 (83.8% of 1025) and 1:1000 (34.8% of 1025) serum dilutions. Seropositivity rates decreased slightly after birth but by four months of age rates were again high. Parasitaemia was present in 26.5% of 1677 slides from pregnant women. Paired comparisons were made on maternal samples collected less than two months before parturition and samples from the infants collected within two months after birth. The paired antibody response by IFA or ELISA was not dependent on the presence of detectable parasitaemia in the mother. Infants from mothers with a history of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis had significantly (P = 0.04) lower IFA titres than other infants. Measuring the absorbance of a 1:100 serum dilution by ELISA appeared to be an excellent method with which to measure longitudinal serologic changes in a population."

Antimalarial treatment provided by volunteer community health workers was made available in each village. Malaria was holoendemic. Parasitaemia rates by age were high and did not change after the control programme began. Plasmodium falciparum was the most common species and was present alone or mixed in 98.2% of 8105 infections. Virtually all (98.5%) of 2040 blood samples collected in May 1981 were positive (reciprocal titre greater than or equal to 80) to P. falciparum by the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. Seropositivity rates to P. falciparum in the IFA test or the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were high in all age groups and did not change significantly in longitudinal surveys or in a cohort of children zero to nine years old followed at intervals. While the malaria control programme was successful in bringing treatment to each village, malaria prevalence was not reduced. Parasitologic and serologic studies alone were not adequate to describe the impact of the community-based malaria control programme in Saradidi. Morbidity and mortality rates caused by malaria can decline, significantly improving the health of the population, in the absence of any decrease in parasitaemia rates."

Sixty health facilities were randomized to receive either RDTs plus training, guidelines, and supervision (TGS) or TGS alone. Of 1,540 patients included in the analysis, 7% had uncomplicated malaria. The provision of RDTs coupled with TGS emphasizing AL use only after laboratory confirmation of malaria reduced recommended treatment by 63%-points (P = 0.04), because diagnostic test use did not change (-2%-points), but health workers significantly reduced presumptive treatment with AL for patients with a clinical diagnosis of malaria who did not undergo testing (-36%-points; P = 0.03). Health workers generally adhered to RDT results when prescribing AL: 88% of RDT-positive and 9% of RDT-negative patients were treated with AL, respectively. Overtreatment was low in both arms and was not significantly reduced by the provision of RDTs (-12%-points, P = 0.30). RDTs could potentially improve malaria case management, but we urgently need to develop more effective strategies for implementing guidelines before large scale implementation."

Agreements to transfer the know-how of some of these leads to industries have been signed. The know-how of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of hepatitis C has been successfully transferred to industry and is being commercially produced. For detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2, indigenous diagnostic kits based on three different formats, namely ELISA, Western blot and rapid test have been developed and are being commercially produced by Indian industries. The factors influencing the successful transfer of laboratory-scale diagnostic assays from academia to industry and their commercial exploitation have been discussed. Indian scientists have made seminal contributions in exploring the possibility to develop an effective and safe contraceptive vaccine to control the increasing human population of India. Achieving contraception by means of vaccine is a novel approach, which entails generation of a specific antibody response against antigens critically involved in the process of mammalian reproduction. In India, three major programs on contraceptive vaccines based on the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin ((beta)hCG) for women, ovine follicle stimulating hormone (oFSH) for men, and riboflavin carrier protein for both males and females have been initiated. The work at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi on contraceptive vaccine for women, based on (beta)hCG, has demonstrated, for the first time, that it is feasible to regulate fertility by such an approach. Basic research being carried out to achieve immunocontraception by interfering at sperm-oocyte interaction level has been briefly discussed. These developments are still at the research stage. In addition to advances in the area of contraceptive vaccines, a non-steroidal contraceptive oral pill has been developed by Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, commercially produced by two Indian pharmaceutical companies and has been incorporated in the National Family Welfare Program.

Brundtland in 1998. The World Health Organization, The United Nation's Children's Fund, the United Nation's Development Programme and World Bank have joined forces to fight malaria, which kills more than one million people a year. RBM is being launched at time of growing and investment in malaria, which still remains grossly underfunded. RBM is different from previous efforts to fight malaria. The project is working not only through new tools for controlling the disease but also by involving and strengthening the health services to affected population. This pattern of activities is close to Russian version of malaria eradication programme that had been carried out with the success in the former Soviet Union in the 1950s. RBM seeks to reduce substantially the human suffering and economic losses due one of the most costly diseases. Malaria causes an estimated 300 to 500 million acute cases per year. Malaria is a disease of young and the poor, many of them children who live with no easy access to health service. RBM goal is a significant reduction--ideally halving within ten years--in the global burden of disease associated with malaria. RBM purpose is to create an environment that helps countries develop policies and implement relevant elements of RBM strategy. There are six elements to roll back malaria. They are: early detection of malaria illness; rapid treatment of those who are ill; multiple means for preventing infection; strengthening of health sector and intersectoral activities; a powerful sustained social involvement and movement; focused research for new tools and better implementation. New tools are available to combat malaria. They include among others: rapid diagnostics; new drugs (artesunates) and new means for delivery; impregnated bednets; new means for predicting epidemics (satellite mapping). WHO will be coordinating the RBM project. Endemic countries and affected populations have identified malaria as a priority health issue. Activities will cut across WHO programmes and regions to support government, to improve technical efficiency and capacity, to optimize resource allocation, utilization and mobilization."
CD008122,0,9781073,0,[Simple malaria attack].,"The clinical presentation of malaria is, in most of cases, a malaria attack. It occurs in 90% of imported cases in France within 30 days after return of endemic area. Characteristic malaria paroxism have three stages: chills, high fever (> 39 degrees C) and sweating stage. In this typical form, parasitaemia is easily disclosed. With the increasing spread of chemoresistance P. falciparum strains, many patients experience non specific symptoms before the onset of paroxysm, often complaining of malaise, headaches, myalgias and anorexia. In some cases temperature did not exceed 38 degrees C and physical examination revealed sometimes liver or splenic enlargement. These atypical presentations can masquerade other diseases such as a viral illness. In those patients blood smears were often negative and malaria diagnosis is carried out only by QBC or parasight test. Treatment of malaria attack needs antimalarial drugs effective against chemoresistant P. falciparum strains.

CD008122,0,2119491,0,The humoral response to heat shock protein 70 in human and murine Schistosomiasis mansoni.,"We have expressed two cDNA sequences encoding 121 and 230 amino acids of the C-terminus of the Schistosoma mansoni Hsp 70 in Escherichia coli. The products were synthesized as polypeptides fused to the RNA polymerase of bacteriophage MS2, and their reactivities were tested in ELISAs, using sera from human and murine infections. Anti-Hsp70 antibodies were detected in a significant number of individuals suffering from chronic schistosomiasis mansoni, but not in patients with known recent infections. This, together with the finding that antibodies directed at S. mansoni-specific Hsp70 determinants during the course of infection of experimental mice were not detectable until 5-6 weeks post-infection, suggests that the protein may be a useful marker for distinguishing late and early infections. The diagnostic specificity of Hsp70 was evaluated with sera from humans infected with different schistosome species and other parasitic diseases. While some subjects infected with S. haematobium produced antibodies which recognized the S. mansoni Hsp70, no such antibodies were generated in S. japonicum infected individuals. However, cross-reactive antibodies were elicited in donors with other parasitic diseases such as filariasis and malaria. The absence of antibodies in early infection and the observed cross-reactivities led us to conclude that Hsp70 will be of limited value in the diagnosis of schistosomiasis."
CD008122,0,18524335,1,Evaluation of the OptiMAL test for diagnosis of malaria in Venezuela.,"We evaluated the OptiMAL rapid dipstick test by comparing it with the conventional standard thick-blood film method, for the detection of malaria in two groups of individuals from different Venezuelan endemic areas. One of the groups consisted of individuals with malaria-like symptoms (n = 113) and the other of asymptomatic individuals (n = 89). The classical microscopy analysis of these populations determined that 67.5% were infected with P. vivax, 31.3% with P. falciparum, and 1.2% with mixed infections. The OptiMAL test showed 96.4% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, 97.5% negative predictive value and optimal concordance (kappa = 0.97), capable of detecting any malaria infection in the evaluated population. However, these parameters were lower when the parasitaemia was < or = 300 parasites/microL. Freezing of the samples did not affect the sensitivity and specificity of the test. We concluded that this rapid malaria test is sensitive and specific for rapid diagnosis of malaria in the field and it is a complement to conventional microscopy."

The sensitivity and specificity of an HRP-2 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (ICT Malaria Pf((R))) compared to microscopy, as well as factors associated with discordant diagnostic results are also presented. P. falciparum infection prevalence was estimated at 7.0% (95% CI 4.9-9.0%) using microscopy. Using microscopy as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the HRP-2 RDT was 100% and specificity was 91.5%; positive predictive value was estimated to be 46.7% (95% CI 36.3-57.4%). RDT discordance, or HRP-2 false positivity, was highest among older children, those in the northern part of Luangwa District, and those with a reported history of antimalarial treatment. These data suggest microscopy should remain the gold standard for estimating malaria parasite point prevalence from household surveys for monitoring and evaluation purposes."

Improved health care and education have been finally accepted as the mile stones of the global development. However, the obstacles to achieve better global health are as follows: global health services crisis, optimal health development strategy in various countries still discussed, insufficient population education and involvement in health matters. In Poland endemic malaria and Taenia solium infections have been eradicated. The incidence of geohelminthoses is substantially reduced. The major parasitological problems now are imported parasitoses (mainly malaria) and infections of zoonotic origin (trichinellosis, alveolar and cystic echinococcoses as well as toxoplasmosis and toxocarosis). Effective control of these parasitoses depends much on more professional teaching and training of health personnel in medical parasitology, better health education of population at large and more active surveilance and control interventions of sanitary-epidemiological services."
CD008122,0,14710739,0,Blood-meal analysis for anopheline mosquitoes sampled along the Kenyan coast.,"A total of 1,480 Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and 439 An. funestus, collected from 30 sites along the Kenyan coast, were tested by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for blood-meal identification. Overall, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) identified 92 and 87% of the samples tested in An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus, respectively. Of these, human IgG was detected in 98.97% (n = 1,347) of An. gambiae s.l. and 99.48% (n = 379) of An. funestus. Only 14 (1.03%) of the An. gambiae s.l. had fed on other vertebrate hosts tested, which were bovines, chickens, and goats. Additionally, only 2 An. funestus had fed on goats. In all the 28 sites that had bloodfed mosquitoes, An. gambiae s.l. had a human blood index greater than 0.9. Twenty-five of these sites had a human blood index greater than 0.9 for An. funestus, while the other 3 sites had no bloodfed mosquitoes. The An. gambiae s.l. were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for species identification. A total of 338 were An. gambiae s.s., 79 were An. arabiensis, and 12 were An. merus. The human blood index was 0.96, 0.91, and 1.0 for An. gambiae s.s., An. arabiensis, and An. merus, respectively. The Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection rates were 6.2% for species in the An. gambiae complex and 3.7% for An. funestus. These results emphasize that An. funestus and members of the An. gambiae complex on the Kenyan coast are highly anthropophilic, with nearly all specimens feeding on humans during every blood meal. The results further demonstrated active transmission of P. falciparum sporozoites by the primary vector species. This study suggests that the use of insecticide-treated nets will be effective for controlling biting mosquitoes inside houses along the coast of Kenya."

Tafenoquine was measured in plasma and venous blood following protein precipitation. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a Waters S5P Spherisorb phenyl analytical cartridge (150 mm x 4.6 mm I.D., 5 microm particle size) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and a mobile phase of 22 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4:acetonitrile (45:55, vol/vol). The flow rate was 1.5 mL/min and the retention times were approximately 3.5 min for WR VIIIAc (internal standard) and approximately 7.8 min for TQ. The interday and intraday coefficients of variation of TQ over a concentration range of 20-1000 ng/mL in plasma were < or =8.4% and in venous blood were < or =9.6%. The mean percent difference between added concentration and obtained concentration was 7.3% in plasma and 8.5% in venous blood over the corresponding concentration range. The limit of quantitation for both fluids was 10 ng/mL. Tafenoquine concentrations were comparable between capillary and venous blood with no significant difference between measurement in both biological fluids. The clinical application of the method was demonstrated by measuring plasma and whole blood concentrations of TQ from participants in a chemosuppression trial of the drug against malaria infections in Thailand."

Malaria transmission occurs throughout the year with a peak in June at the beginning of the rainy season. The Annual Parasite Index was 1,279 per 1,000 populations at risk. Plasmodium falciparum infections accounted for 64% of all infections, P. vivax for 28%, and P. malariae for 4%. Mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax infections were diagnosed in 15 people representing 4% of total cases. Children under 10 years accounted for 58% of the cases; the risk for malaria in this age group was 77% higher than for those in the greater than 50 years age group. Anopheles darlingi was the predominant anopheline species landing on humans indoors with a biting peak between midnight and dawn. A significant positive correlation was found between malaria monthly incidence and mean number of An. darlingi caught. There was not a significant relationship between mean number of An. darlingi and rainfall or between incidence and rainfall. A total of 7295 anophelines were assayed by ELISA for detection of Plasmodium circumsporozoite (CS) protein. Only An. darlingi (55) was positive for CS proteins of P. falciparum (0.42%), P. malariae (0.25%), and P. vivax-247 (0.1%). The overall estimated entomological inoculation rate was 129 positive bites/person/year.

CD008122,0,17568930,0,Urban malaria in the Brazilian Western Amazon Region I: high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in an urban riverside district is associated with a high level of clinical malaria.,"Cross sectional studies on malaria prevalence was performed in 2001, 2002, and 2004 in Vila Candelária, an urban riverside area of Porto Velho, Rondônia, in the Brazilian Western Amazon, followed by longitudinal surveys on malaria incidence. Vila Candelária is a working class district, provided with electricity, water supply, and basic sanitation. Previous preliminary surveys indicated high malaria incidence in this community. At the end of year 2000 regular diagnostic and treatment measures for malaria were introduced, with active search of febrile cases among residents. Despite of both rapid treatment of cases and relative good sanitary and housing conditions, the malaria incidence persisted at high levels during the following years with an annual parasite index of 150 to 300/1000 inhabitants. Parasite surveys in 2001, 2002, and 2004 achieved through microscopy and polymerase chain reaction to diagnose malaria showed a constant high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers for both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax parasites. It was concluded that asymptomatic carriers represent an important reservoirs of parasites and that the carriers might contribute to maintaining the high level of transmission. Comparing our findings to similar geo-demographic situations found in other important urban communities of the Brazilian Amazon, we propose that asymptomatic carriers could explain malaria's outbreaks like the one recently observed in Manaus."

Clinical and biochemical data were prospectively collected from 171 consecutive Bangladeshi adults with severe malaria. On admission, 57% of patients were hyponatremic. Plasma sodium and Glasgow Coma Score were inversely related (r(s) = -0.36, P < 0.0001). Plasma antidiuretic hormone concentrations were similar in hyponatremic and normonatremic patients (median, range: 6.1, 2.3-85.3 versus 32.7, 3.0-56.4 pmol/L; P = 0.19). Mortality was lower in hyponatremic than normonatremic patients (31.6% versus 51.4%; odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.44 [0.23-0.82]; P = 0.01 by univariate analysis). Plasma sodium normalized with crystalloid rehydration from (median, range) 127 (123-140) mmol/L on admission to 136 (128-149) mmol/L at 24 hours (P = 0.01). Hyponatremia in adults with severe malaria is common and associated with preserved consciousness and decreased mortality.

Parasites may be present in the placenta yet not detectable in peripheral blood smears by routine light microscopy. In order to determine how frequently misdiagnosis occurs, peripheral blood and placental samples were collected from 1,077 Cameroonian women at the time of giving birth and examined for the presence of malarial parasites by using light microscopy. Results showed that 20.1% of the women who had placental malaria were peripheral blood smear negative. Thus, malarial infection was not detected by microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears from approximately one out of five malaria-infected women. Since P. falciparum parasites secrete histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2), we sought to determine if detecting HRP-2 in either peripheral plasma or whole blood might be used to diagnose the presence of parasites ""hidden"" in the placenta. Samples of peripheral plasma from 127 women with different levels of placental malarial infection were assayed by HRP-2-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HRP-2 was detected in 88% of the women with placental malaria who tested negative by blood smear. Additionally, whole blood was obtained from 181 women and tested for HRP-2 with a rapid, chromatographic strip test (ICT). The ICT test accurately detected malarial infection in 89.1% of P. falciparum-infected women. Furthermore, 94% of women with malaria were accurately diagnosed by using a combination of microscopy and the ICT test. Thus, detection of HRP-2 in conjunction with microscopy should improve diagnosis of malaria in pregnant women."
CD008122,0,19374905,0,Human CD1 dimeric proteins as indispensable tools for research on CD1-binding lipids and CD1-restricted T cells.,"Antigen presenting molecules play an important role in both innate and adoptive immune responses by priming and activating T cells. Among them, CD1 molecules have been identified to present both exogenous and endogenous lipid antigens to CD1-restricted T cells. The involvement of CD1-restricted T cells in autoimmune diseases and in defense against infectious diseases, however, remains largely unknown. Identifying novel antigenic lipids that bind to CD1 molecules and understanding the role of CD1-restricted T cells should lead to the successful development of vaccines, because the lipids can be used as antigens and also as adjuvants. In this paper, we have constructed functional recombinant human CD1 dimeric proteins and established a competitive ELISA assay to measure the lipid binding to CD1 molecules using the CD1 dimers. By using the competitive ELISA assay, we were able to show that the lipid extracts from murine malaria parasites can actually be loaded onto CD1 molecules. In addition, we have demonstrated that artificial antigen-presenting cells, which consist of magnetic beads coated with CD1d dimer and anti-CD28 antibody, stimulated and expanded human invariant NKT cells as efficiently as autologous immature DCs. A set of the tools presented in the current study should be valuable for screening various CD1 molecule-binding lipid antigens and for isolating CD1-restricted T cells."

To assess the ability of health systems to maintain RDTs within manufacturers' specifications, we monitored temperatures in the delivery chain from manufacturer through to the village health worker in Cambodia and the Philippines. In both countries, storage temperatures regularly exceeded those recommended for most RDTs intended for field use, whereas temperatures during transport greatly exceeded the lower and upper limits.

Elevated levels of both total- and malaria-specific IgE have been demonstrated in sera from people living in malaria-endemic regions. Whether or not these IgE antibodies are pathogenic is unclear. Serum containing high IgE levels obtained from malaria individuals was used to establish whether IgE-immune complexes could induce IL-4 production in human basophils. The basophils, obtained from healthy donors, were primed with 10 ng/ml of IL-3 before being transferred to wells containing goat anti-human IgE or human antimalarial IgE-immune complexes. IL-4 was induced upon stimulation of human basophils by plate bound IgE-containing immune complexes. Basophils treated similarly but with goat anti-IgG/human antimalarial- IgG-immune complexes did not secrete IL-4. Similarly mononuclear cells depleted of basophils in parallel culture did not secrete IL-4. Thus, human basophils may contribute to the polarization of T-helper type 2 in the (Th2) responses in malaria hosts via IgE-induced IL-4 production."

CD008122,0,9125537,0,Acquired immune responses to the N- and C-terminal regions of Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 in individuals exposed to malaria.,"In this study, we evaluated the naturally acquired immune response to Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (PvMSP1) in individuals with recent clinical episodes of malaria from the state of Para, Brazil. Ten recombinant proteins representing the first 682 amino acids (aa) of the N-terminal region and one representing the final 111 aa of the C-terminal region were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Both of these regions have been suggested as candidates for development of a vaccine against Plasmodium sp. The total frequencies of individuals with antibodies and cellular immune responses to PvMSP1 were high (83.8 and 75%, respectively). The recombinant proteins representing the N- and C-terminal regions were recognized by 51.4 and 64.1% of sera, respectively. The frequency of responders to the C-terminal region increased according to the number of previous malaria episodes, reaching 83.3% after four episodes. Cellular immune response was measured by in vitro proliferation and gamma interferon production. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 75 and 47.2% of individuals proliferated in response to stimulation by the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. Also, we found that one protein representing the N terminus and a second representing the C terminus of PvMSP1 stimulated 54.5% of individuals to secrete gamma interferon. We concluded that PvMSP1 is immunogenic to a large proportion of individuals exposed to malaria. Our results also suggested that the C-terminal region of PvMSP1 containing the two epidermal growth factor-like domains is particularly immunogenic to antibodies and T cells during natural infection in humans."

After a miniscreen of 9 DNA-extracted blood samples using the 17 primer sets stated above, 5 primer sets were short-listed (based on their superior sensitivity) and used for a maxi-screen of DNA extracted from 126 microscopy-positive blood samples from Pakistan, with the following results. (i) For the detection of P. falciparum, the direct primer pair 'PF1 + PF2' gave a sensitivity of 95% and the nested primer set 'RIT405 + RIT406/RIT371 + RIT372' gave a sensitivity of 97%. (ii) For the detection of P. vivax, the direct primer pair 'Forward + Reverse' and the nested primer set 'PLF + UNR/PLF + VIR' both gave a sensitivity of 94%. (iii) The nested multiplex primer set 'rPLU5 + rPLU6/rFAL1 + rFAL2 + rVIV1 + rVIV2' gave a sensitivity of 97% and 96% for P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. It was concluded that the nested multiplex primer set was the most optimal primer set to use for the detection of malaria DNA extracted from blood samples. Furthermore, the nested multiplex primer set has the advantage of simultaneously detecting and differentiating between P. vivax and P. falciparum."
CD008122,0,11447924,0,"A simple, efficient and inexpensive program for preventing prematurity.","Prevention of prematurity and of low birth weight is--because of the associated increased risk of mortality and morbidity--one of the most urgent tasks of perinatal medicine. Whereas the rate of prematures all over the world does not vary very much (5-10%), the rate of infants born with low birth weight lies between 3.6% and 10% in the industrial countries and between 9.8% and 43% in the developing countries, where the main cause of low birth weight is intrauterine malnutrition. As there are different causes for prematurity and low birth weight, but also because various countries have different resources and have therefore to set their priorities differently, there is no global solution. The situation in each country must be considered individually. However, as far as basic means are available for the majority--such as basic health care, monitoring the nutritional state of the mothers and acting to prevent infectious diseases (malaria in particular can cause prematurity)--determined prevention of prematurity should take the form of screening and the treatment of disturbances of the vaginal milieu or genital infections. This policy can be recommended because one of the most important avoidable causes of prematurity is ascending genital infection (mostly combined with bacterial vaginosis), which very frequently starts with a disturbance of the vaginal milieu and then often takes its course asymptomatically. Regular screening for signs of such a disturbance using vaginal pH-measurements (and if necessary further diagnostics and therapy) makes possible the detection of an ""early marker"" to prevent prematurity in an effective and inexpensive way. Our prematurity-prevention-program, which has been successful for many years, is based on an anamnestic assessment of prematurity risk, the early detection of warning signs (including regular measurement of the vaginal pH) and, if necessary, the appropriate therapeutic measures. In cases of disturbance of the vaginal milieu, the latter consists of a therapy with lactobacillus preparations or in a combination of lactobacillus preparation with an acidifying therapy which may lead to earlier normalization of the vaginal milieu. In cases of bacterial vaginosis local therapy, for example with metronidazol or clindamycin, is undertaken, and in other infections specific treatment. It is encouraging to note that particularly the rate of the very small prematures is reduced when pregnant patients take part in our self-care-program, measuring their own vaginal pH-value twice a week, and also searching for any other warning signs. In this way in our collective the rate of very small low birth weight infants could be reduced from 7.8% in the immediate previous pregnancy to 1.3%. In a prospective study performed in Erfurt the rate of very early premature births (< 32 + 0 gw) amounted to only 0.3% in contrast to 3.3% in a control group who had not taken part in the self-care activity. According to a differentiated classification of the control group the success of the self-care activity was even clearer: In patients who did not take part because their doctors did not support the self-care activity, the rate of very early premature births amounted to 4.1%. In patients who did not take part in the self-care activity, but who were in the care of doctors who were interested and had taken part in the prevention-program, the rate was 2.2%; in the group with active participation in the self-care activity it was only 0.3%. To date measurement of the vaginal pH-value was performed intravaginally using either indicator strips or pH-measuring test gloves. A short time ago we developed a panty liner coated with an indicator strip, which enables reading of the pH-value by just checking the indicator on the panty liner. First results with this panty liner are very promising."

In the current study, we demonstrated that DBP is naturally immunogenic in different populations of the Brazilian Amazon, and the proportions of DBP IgG positive subjects increased with exposure to malaria, reaching a peak in those subjects with long-term exposure (> 15 years) in the Amazon area. This profile of antibody response was significantly different from the one observed for the P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1(19)), which was relatively uniform in areas with markedly different levels of malaria transmission. In a small sample of adults with symptomless P. vivax infection, we could not detect any significant correlation between antibodies against these P. vivax proteins and asymptomatic infection. Our study provided an additional insight by demonstrating cumulative exposure as a determinant that acts independently of host age in generation of anti-DBP IgG response."

In both communities, antibodies against the full-length ectodomain (both FVO and 3D7 allele constructs) prior to a malaria transmission season were significantly associated with protection from malaria in the following 6 months, even after adjusting for age and antibody reactivity to whole parasite (schizont) extract. However, these protective associations of antibodies were only seen among subjects that were parasite slide positive at the time of pre-season serum sampling. Competition ELISAs with the FVO and 3D7 allele constructs showed that antibodies can recognise either conserved or allele-specific epitopes in AMA1. Results encourage the development of an AMA1 vaccine based on the full-length ectodomain, and indicate that the function of human antibodies to allele-specific and conserved epitopes in AMA1 should be studied further."

We have recently shown that the prevalence of hypohaptoglobinemia is a useful epidemiologic indicator in malaria endemic areas. The main limitation to the practical utilisation of this indicator is the available methodologies. Here we describe a sandwich ELISA for the determination of haptoglobin concentrations which is easy to perform, sensitive and requires a minimal amount of equipment. With this test system it is possible to detect haptoglobin in serum at a lower limit of 100 micrograms/ml for 10(-4) dilutions and of less than 1 micrograms/ml for 10(-2) dilutions. This represents at least 200 fold increase in sensitivity as compared to radial immunodiffusion."
CD008122,0,12219143,1,Performance of OptiMAL(R) in the diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections in a malaria referral center in Colombia.,"Alternative, non-microscopic methods for the diagnosis of malaria have recently become available. Among these, rapid dipstick methods stand out. One such test, OptiMAL(R), is based on the immunochromatographic detection of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and has the capacity to detect and distinguish infections caused by P. falciparum and Plasmodium sp. This capacity is particularly important in countries where different species of Plasmodium co-exist. In this study we evaluated the performance of OptiMAL(R) in an urban referral center for malaria diagnosis. Two sets of patients were included: one (n = 112) having predetermined infections with P. falciparum or P. vivax and individuals with negative blood smears; and another consisting of all eligible consecutive patients (n = 80) consulting for diagnosis at the referral center during one month. The overall diagnostic efficiency of OptiMAL(R) for both sets of patients was 96.9%. Efficiency was higher for P. vivax (98.1%) than for P. falciparum (94.9%). These results corroborate the diagnostic utility of OptiMAL(R) in settings where P. vivax and P. falciparum co-exist and support its implementation where microscopic diagnosis is unavailable and in circumstances that exceed the capacity of the local microscopic diagnosis facility."

Although microscopy is gold standard in malaria diagnosis, its reliability is largely dependent on user skill. In this study, we evaluated practitioners' clinical and microscopists' technical skills in diagnosis of malaria in central Sudan. In a retrospective study, 3203 blood smears from 95 peripheral health facilities (each represented by a general practitioner [GP] and general microscopist [GM]) were reexamined by expert microscopist. Furthermore, in a prospective study, 410 patients had their malaria diagnosis rechecked by rapid diagnostic test for validation of the microscopic diagnosis. Results showed that the rate of false-positive diagnosis of malaria was 75.6% and false-negative diagnosis was 0.01%. The study disclosed poor skills of the GPs and GMs in malaria diagnosis because 43% of the GPs and 44% of the GMs failed to make a single true-positive malaria diagnosis. The false-positive malaria diagnosis showed bias toward adult females. Economically, the calculated cost of diagnosis and treatment of malaria in Sudan in year 2000 is US$100 million, whereas the calculated cost of true malaria is approximately US$14 million. In conclusion, malaria overdiagnosis was widely recognized in central Sudan, with high economic burden during the era of artemisinin-based combination therapy. Finally, different scenarios were suggested for improvement of malaria diagnosis."

The substitution of newer and more costly drugs brings with it the need for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive diagnostic procedures so that directed therapy can be used. We report a field trial comparing standard microscopic malaria diagnosis and quantitative buffy coat analysis to a new P. falciparum antigen detection system. The ParaSight F test (PFT) was found to be easy to learn, rapid to perform, and highly accurate. If confirmed, the use of the PFT in endemic areas may aid in the identification of patients requiring therapy for drug-resistant malaria."

It was essentially very useful to detect parasites below < or = 100 parasites/ul of blood by QBC technique. However, quantification of parasitaemia could not be made using this technique. Many cases of carriers having very few gametocytes in their blood were also identified. It is therefore, concluded that the QBC technique, may be appropriate for screening populations for malaria and for detection of asymptomatic carriers to control further transmission of the disease in the community."

The study was carried out on serum samples from 52 patients with chronic Chagas disease, 103 individuals with current (parasitemic) or past malaria (aparasitemic), 43 patients with syphilis, 21 individuals with heterologous antibodies, and 100 blood donors. Dot-ELISA-Multi yielded 99% specificity for Chagas disease and 100% for malaria and syphilis. The test sensitivity was 100% for chronic Chagas disease, 88% for syphilis, 90% for P. vivax, and 47% for P. falciparum. In past malaria individuals, positivity was 92%. Therefore, Dot-ELISA-Multi can be useful under field conditions where laboratory facilities and resources are scarce, for small-scale epidemiologic studies."

Molecular surveillance of resistance-mediating mutations in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) has been proposed as a means of predicting SP treatment outcomes, but optimal methods of surveillance in different populations have not been well established. To investigate the relationship between molecular markers of SP resistance, host immunity, and response to therapy, we evaluated the association between the presence of five key dhfr and dhps mutations at enrollment and clinical outcome in children and adults treated with SP for uncomplicated malaria in Kampala, Uganda. Clinical treatment failure was 11% at 14 days, increasing to 30% at 28 days, after excluding new infections. Outcomes varied markedly based on the number of dhfr and dhps mutations and on the age of treated subjects. All infections with less than two dhfr/dhps mutations were successfully treated. Treatment failure associated with any two, three, or four dhfr/dhps mutations occurred in nine of 24 (38%) children up to 5 years, but not in older patients (0/20). In the presence of all five mutations, treatment failure occurred equally in children aged 5 years or younger [7/16 (44%)] and in older patients [8/16 (50%)]. Our results showed that age, a surrogate marker of antimalarial immunity, had a major impact on the relationship between polymorphisms in SP target enzymes and treatment outcomes. The use of molecular markers of SP resistance to predict treatment failure rates should take age into account."
CD008122,0,10444320,1,Feasibility of a rapid dipstick antigen-capture assay for self-testing of travellers' malaria.,"This open comparative study sought to determine whether, and with what level of instruction, travellers can successfully use and interpret the rapid whole blood malaria diagnostic test, ParaSight F. 160 visitors to the Zürich University Travel Clinic took part in the study. One group received written instructions only, while another group was given combined oral and written instructions on how to test their own blood for malaria infection and interpret a series of 5 prepared test strips. Each volunteer also completed a questionnaire targeted at assessing performance in using the diagnostic, interpretation of the results and acceptability of the concept of self-testing for malaria infection. The main outcome measures were successful performance of the test, correct interpretation of prepared test strips and acceptability of the test. In the group which received only written instructions, 60/80 (75%) were successful, whilst in the group which received written and oral instructions, 72/80 (90%) successfully performed the test (P < 0.02). Overall, 565 (70.6%) test strips were correctly and 165 (20.6%) incorrectly interpreted with 113 (14.1%) false negative interpretations. No prepared test strip was interpreted as false positive. Seventy (8.8%) test strips were not interpreted. Some 91. 9% of all candidates would use such a test if it were available. While it is possible for lay persons to successfully perform the test, interpretation of results poses a problem. In particular, the proportion of false negative interpretations is unacceptable. A combination of written and oral instructions leads to a significantly higher level of successful test performance. If such a test is to be made available to the general public, written instructions must be made concise and foolproof and the test endpoint clearly defined, as the currently available test is more suitable for trained laboratory personnel. In the meantime other candidate diagnostics have become available and these should now be assessed for their suitability in the context of travellers' malaria."
CD008122,0,7558316,0,"Relationship between maternally derived anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies and risk of infection and disease in infants living in an area of Liberia, west Africa, in which malaria is highly endemic.","In areas where Plasmodium falciparum is endemic, immunoglobulin G is acquired by the fetus in utero, mainly during the third trimester of pregnancy. The potential protective effect of transferred anti-P. falciparum maternal antibodies was examined in a longitudinal study of 100 infants from birth to 1 year of age. The probability of acquiring a P. falciparum infection and developing an episode of clinical malaria was determined in relation to the P. falciparum-specific antibody level of the infant at birth against P. falciparum schizont antigen or recombinant merozoite surface protein MSP1(19) antigen. The risk of acquiring an episode of clinical malaria increased from birth to 6 months of age, after which it decreased. The overall prevalence of P. falciparum parasitemia was highest (48.9%) in the 6-month-old infants. The age-specific hematocrit value showed the lowest mean value (30.2) from 6 to 9 months, and the spleen rate was the highest (69.8%) at the same age. There was a lower risk of developing an episode of clinical malaria during the first year of life in the infants with high levels of anti-MSP1(19) antibodies at birth. The level of maternally derived overall anti-schizont antigen antibodies did not seem to play a role in the relative risk of developing malaria infection or disease during the first year of life, though the level of specific anti-MSP1(19) antibodies may be associated with protection."
CD008122,0,16438128,0,Optimizing malarial epidemiological studies in areas of low transmission.,"Malaria risk factor studies have traditionally used microscopy readings of blood slides as the measure of malaria infection in humans, although alternatives are available. There is the need for an assessment of how the use of these alternative diagnostic approaches will influence the efficiency and significance of epidemiological studies. In an area of Sri Lanka with known risk factors for malaria, two cross-sectional surveys were done at the start and at the peak of transmission season. Microscopy was compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The major risk factor in this area was the location of houses relative to confirmed vector breeding sites. At the peak of the transmission season, the results pointed in the same direction, irrespective of the diagnostic method used. However, the importance of distance from the breeding site was not statistically significant when microscopy was used, which can be explained by the lower prevalence of microscopy positivity in comparison to the prevalence of ELISA- and PCR-positivity. This study suggests that in low-transmission areas, such as Sri Lanka, smaller sample sizes can be used for epidemiological research studies using PCR instead of microscopy to estimate parasite prevalence. This efficiency gain has to be weighed against the higher cost and complexity of the PCR. PCR cannot replace microscopy as the standard diagnostic procedure at the field level. ELISA is not directly comparable with microscopy and PCR but it can also be a useful tool in malaria epidemiological studies. This study indicates that cross-sectional surveys are only efficient if they take place during peak transmission season. Cross sectional surveys currently implemented by the Sri Lankan government in response to local malaria outbreaks can form the basis for valid epidemiological studies and be used for the generation of malaria risk maps if samples were also analyzed using PCR."
CD008122,0,8944258,1,ParaSight-F test for the detection of treatment failure in multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"The ParaSight-F test for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum was evaluated for its accuracy and usefulness in predicting treatment outcome in 75 patients (70 males, 5 females) with acute uncomplicated malaria who attended a malaria clinic in Mae Sot, Tak province, on the Thai-Myanmar border. All patients were admitted to the clinic for 28 d to exclude reinfection. The test was performed using blood samples collected into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid from the patients on admission, and on days 1, 2, 7, and 14. The presence of microscopically detectable parasitaemia was used as the reference for sensitivity and specificity of the test. The reappearance of parasites on day 28 was used to determine the accuracy of predicting the outcome of artemether treatment on day 14. The sensitivity of the ParaSight-F test on admission, and on days 1, 2, 7, and 14, was 98.7%, 96.7%, 100%, 100% and 100%, respectively, with corresponding specificities of 50%, 24.2%, 47.1% and 72.9%. The sensitivity for predicting recrudescence by using the test on day 14 was 100%, with 97.7% specificity, and the sensitivity of predicting a sensitive response on day 14 was 97.7%, with 100% specificity. The test seems to permit more precise detection of treatment failure under 'field' conditions if used on day 14 after the start of treatment."

Very low levels of protection were detected, regarding both compulsory and optional vaccines as well as antimalarial protection. It was found out that the information sources that had been consulted were not the optimal ones and that they had delivered remarkably inaccurate advice. Only 44% had received some type of vaccination. Important geographic errors were recorded regarding vaccination against yellow fever. Few travelers received optional vaccines, although these provide protection against highly prevalent diseases in tropical areas. Errors in antimalarial chemoprophylaxis were related both to drug dosage and their adequacy to the corresponding areas. Travelers prematurely interrupted prophylaxis in a progressive fashion depending on the number of elapsed weeks. Only 33% of the 39% who started prophylaxis before leaving completed it correctly. Travelers from health care professions had a higher rate of early abandonment of antimalarial prophylaxis and a worse immune protection against yellow fever, with a 5% signification level (p less than 0.05) when compared with the rest of travelers. Suggestions to improve this situations are made, such as an adequate education of health professionals and the general population, the reshaping of official vaccination centers and the introduction of adequate antimalarial drugs in the Spanish pharmacopeia."
CD008122,0,1566302,0,Diagnosis of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness using an antigen detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"A monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (antigen ELISA) developed for detection of trypanosome antigens in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients as a means for diagnosis of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness was evaluated at the Bureau Central de la Trypanosomiase, Kinshasa, Zaire. Sixty-nine (89.6%) of 77 parasitologically confirmed cases examined at the Daloa clinic had antigens in serum; 35 (45.5%) had antigens in CSF and, in 4 of these, the antigens were detected in CSF only. Taking the serum and CSF results together, 73 (94.8%) of the 77 patients were positive in the assay. In the Kinshasa series, 168 (89.4%) of 188 parasitologically confirmed cases were positive by antigen ELISA. The controls, who included 165 blood donors and 40 patients with malaria, 2 with hydatidosis and 12 with leishmaniasis, were negative by antigen ELISA. Analysis of CSF results for 35 patients who had antigens in CSF revealed that 34 (97.1%) had elevated CSF white cell counts, 29 (82.9%) had elevated protein levels, and 23 (65.7%) had trypanosomes in their CSF. Moreover, analysis of results for 34 patients whose CSF had been shown to harbour trypanosomes by the double centrifugation technique showed that 24 (70.6%) had antigens in CSF, 28 (82.6%) had elevated protein levels, and 33 (97.1%) had elevated CSF white cell counts. Antigens were rapidly cleared from peripheral circulation following institution of treatment. Antigen clearance was accompanied by a rapid fall in CSF protein levels and white cell counts. These results demonstrate the potential of antigen ELISA, not only as a tool for diagnosis, but also for clinical staging and treatment follow-up of patients with T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness."

CD008122,0,11071281,0,A cysteine protease activity from Plasmodium falciparum cleaves human erythrocyte ankyrin.,"The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum undergoes distinct morphologic changes during its 48-h life cycle inside human red blood cells. Parasite proteinases appear to play important roles at all stages of the erythrocytic cycle of human malaria. Proteases involved in erythrocyte rupture and invasion are possibly required to breakdown erythrocyte membrane skeleton. To identify such proteases, soluble cytosolic extract of isolated trophozoites/schizonts was incubated with erythrocyte membrane ghosts or spectrin-actin depleted inside-out vesicles, which were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In both cases, a new protein band of 155 kDa was detected. The N-terminal peptide sequencing established that the 155 kDa band represents truncated ankyrin. Immunoblot analysis using defined monoclonal antibodies confirmed that ankyrin was cleaved at the C-terminus. While the enzyme preferentially cleaved ankyrin, degradation of protein 4.1 was also observed at high concentrations of the enzyme. The optimal activity of the purified enzyme, using ankyrin as substrate, was observed at pH 7.0-7.5, and the activity was strongly inhibited by standard inhibitors of cysteine proteinases (cystatin, NEM, leupeptin, E-64 and MDL 28 170), but not by inhibitors of aspartic (pepstatin) or serine (PMSF, DFP) proteinases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that protease digestion of ankyrin substantially reduces its interaction with ankyrin-depleted membrane vesicles. Ektacytometric measurements showed a dramatic increase in the rate of fragmentation of ghosts after treatment with the protease. Although the role of ankyrin cleavage in vivo remains to be determined, based on our findings we postulate that the parasite-derived cysteine protease activity cleaves host ankyrin thus weakening the ankyrin-band 3 binding interactions and destabilizing the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, which, in turn, facilitates parasite release. Further characterization of the enzyme may lead to the development of novel antimalarial drugs."

A Fab-phage display library was made, and three distinct antibodies designated RAM1, RAM2, and RAM3 were isolated by panning. Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG3 full-length antibodies have been produced in CHO cells. Reactivity with the native parasite protein was demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting. Furthermore, the antiparasitic effect of RAM1 has been tested in vitro in an antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) assay.

Questionnaires were used in 1996 to evaluate the use and interpretation of the Widal test, and checklists were used to assess its laboratory performance in 2 of the 10 provinces in Cameroon. The majority of prescribers from 20 health facilities (an average of 76% of the doctors and 61% of the nurses) could detect patients who truly had positive Widal tests and needed treatment. However, an average of 48% of the doctors and 84% of the nurses would treat patients who did not require treatment based on the Widal test result. Patients may therefore be treated unnecessarily. Most (88%) of the visited laboratories performed the Widal rapid slide agglutination test as opposed to the conventional tube agglutination test. About 14% of the laboratories that performed the rapid slide agglutination test had a score above average for each criterion evaluated. Misdiagnosis of typhoid fever leads to unnecessary expenditure and exposure of patients to the side-effects of antibiotics. In addition, misdiagnosis may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of malaria, and other acute febrile illness."

CD008122,0,9202005,0,Inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum proliferation in vitro by ribozymes.,"Catalytic RNA (ribozymes) suppressed the growth of the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. The phosphorothioated hammerhead ribozymes targeted unique regions of the P. falciparum carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II gene. The P. falciparum carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II gene encodes the first and limiting enzyme in the pathway, and its mRNA transcript contains two large insert regions absent in other carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases, including that from humans. These inserts are ideal targets for nucleic acid therapy. Exogenous delivery of ribozymes to cultures reduced malarial viability up to 55% at 0.5 microM ribozyme concentrations, which is significantly greater than control levels (5-15% reduction), suggesting a sequence-specific inhibition. This inhibition was shown to be stage-specific, with optimal inhibitions being detected after 24 h, coincident with maximal production of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase enzyme in the course of the life cycle of the parasite. A decrease in total carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity was observed only in cultures treated with the ribozymes. The task of developing alternative therapeutic agents against malaria is urgent due to the evolution of drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum, the most virulent of all human malarial parasites. Another critical issue to be addressed is the possibility of eliminating or reducing any systemic toxicity to the host, which can potentially be provided by nucleic acid therapy. This work is the first reported assessment of the ability of ribozymes as antimalarials. Ribozyme inhibition assays can also aid in identifying important antimalarial loci for chemotherapy. The malarial parasite can, in turn, be a useful in vivo host to study the catalysis and function of new ribozyme designs."

Frequent polymorphisms found in the MBL2 gene affect the concentration and functionality of the protein and are associated with enhanced susceptibility to severe malaria in African children. Most MBL2 typing strategies were designed to the analysis of selected variants, the significance of whole haplotypes is poorly known. In this work, a new typing strategy was developed and validated in an association analysis of MBL2 with adult asymptomatic infection."
CD008122,0,10705302,0,Serum concentrations of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in complicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Involvement of neutrophils in the control of blood parasites in malaria has been reported. Both, mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils are known to be stimulated by cytokines such as TNF-alpha in order to augment the defence potency against the parasites. Previously, it has been shown that serum-G-CSF concentrations are increased in patients with bacterial sepsis. In vitro studies have shown that P. falciparum - infected erythrocytes induce the release of G-CSF by several cells such as endothelial cells and monocytes, however, nothing is known about G-CSF serum concentrations during the clinical course of severe P. falciparum malaria. Thus, it was the aim of the present study to investigate the time course for G-CSF serum concentrations in patients with complicated P. falciparum malaria, and to correlate these values with other mediators of inflammation and hematopoesis. Twenty-six patients suffering from complicated P. falciparum malaria were included in the study, and 20, age and sex matched, healthy volunteers were used as the negative control group. Serum samples for determination of G-CSF were taken on day 0, 7 and 14, and measured by ELISA. We found significantly increased serum concentrations of G-CSF in patients with complicated P. falciparum malaria on day 0, values decreasing to within the normal range by day 7. A significant correlation was found between G-CSF (d0) and procalcitonin, the parasite count, erythropoietin and macrophage inflammatory protein, however no correlation could be shown for the neutrophil count. In conclusion, on the day of hospital admission, elevated serum concentrations of G-CSF were detected in patients with complicated P. falciparum malaria, which might indicate a role of G-CSF in the acute defence mechanism against the parasites."

CD008122,0,1566015,0,[Significance of the automated blood count].,"Modern hematology depends on rapid and accurate determination of quantitative and qualitative blood counts. Fully automated analyzers based on the principles of flow cytometry have replaced the traditional blood smear in the routine laboratory. They count the number of red cells, platelets and leukocytes with high precision. In addition, they divide the cells into different populations according to their physical or chemical properties. This population distribution pattern mimics a ""differential"" blood smear. Normality can be assessed with a high degree of accuracy, rapidly and reproducibly. The qualitative changes frequently provide pointers to the final diagnosis. In case of abnormalities the reports are flagged. A microscopic analysis should be added according to internal laboratory guidelines. It clarifies pathological findings and is essential in the search for specific abnormalities such as malaria. This underlines the need for exchange of information between physician and laboratory."
CD008122,0,7957750,0,Plasmodium falciparum: the Pf332 antigen is secreted from the parasite by a brefeldin A-dependent pathway and is translocated to the erythrocyte membrane via the Maurer's clefts.,"The transport of the megadalton protein Pf332 was studied during the asexual bloodstage development of Plasmodium falciparum. Four mouse monoclonal antibodies, produced against a recombinant polypeptide derived from the Pf332 protein, were used to analyze the kinetics of synthesis, the subcellular location, and transport of this giant molecule to the erythrocyte membrane. After parasite invasion of a red blood cell, the Pf332 antigen is first detected in young trophozoites at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane or in the cytoplasm of the erythrocyte as large vesicle-like structures. The number of vesicles increases during maturation of the parasite and thus forms a rim-like immunofluorescence pattern between the erythrocyte membrane and the parasitophorous vacuole at very late stages. The various anti-Pf332 antibodies react with the surface of erythrocytes infected with very mature parasites (segmenter stage 42-46 hr postinvasion). Immunoelectron microscopic analysis shows that the Pf332 antigen is transported in association with Maurer's clefts in the cytoplasm of the erythrocyte. This transport could be completely blocked by Brefeldin A, resulting in the accumulation of the antigen within the parasite. These data strongly suggest that the Pf332 antigen is exported to the erythrocyte cytoplasm via the classical Golgi secretory pathway."
CD008122,0,11044264,0,Micronutrient and iron supplementation and effective antimalarial treatment synergistically improve childhood anaemia.,"The control of childhood anaemia in malaria holoendemic areas is a major public health challenge for which an optimal strategy remains to be determined. Malaria prevention may compromise the development of partial immunity. Regular micronutrient supplementation has been suggested as an alternative but its effectiveness remains unsettled. We therefore conducted a randomised placebo-controlled intervention trial with 207 Tanzanian children aged 5 months to 3 years on the efficacy of supervised supplementation of low-dose micronutrients including iron (Poly Vi-Sol with iron) three times per week, with an average attendance of >/= 90%. The mean haemoglobin (Hb) level increased by 8 g/l more in children on supplement (95% CI 3-12) during the 5-month study. All age groups benefited from the intervention including severely anaemic subjects. The mean erythrocyte cell volume (MCV) increased but Hb in children >/= 24 months improved independently of MCV and no relation was found with hookworm infection. The data therefore suggest that micronutrients other than iron also contributed to Hb improvement. In the supplement group of children who had received sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) treatment, the mean Hb level increased synergistically by 22 g/l (95% CI 13-30) compared to 7 g/l (95% CI 3-10) in those without such treatment. Supplementation did not affect malaria incidence. In conclusion, micronutrient supplementation improves childhood anaemia in malaria holoendemic areas and this effect is synergistically enhanced by temporary clearance of parasitaemia."
CD008122,0,11436600,0,[Epidemiological and therapeutic aspects of plasmodial infection from Plasmodium vivax].,"A major challenge for successful treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria is prevention of recurrence due to activation of dormant intrahepatic parasitic forms called hypnozoits. As a result of strain variability, recurrences are unpredictable and can occur months or even years after initial infection. Prevention requires elimination of both erythrocytic and hepatic parasite forms by combined use of chloroquine and primaquine. Primaquine is the only commercially available drug against hypnozoits. Several factors must be taken into account in planning treatment regimens. One factor is drug resistance of vivax strains, which as observed for Plasmodium falciparum strains is variable between geographical areas. Another factor is potential co-infection by Plasmodium vivax and falciparum, which is increasingly common. For optimal efficacy, treatment regimens must be adjusted with regard to dosage of primaquine and association with halofantrine, mefloquine or other new antimalarial agents. No regimen completely rules out the risk of recurrence."
CD008122,0,16762109,0,Quality of treatment for febrile illness among children at outpatient facilities in sub-Saharan Africa.,"For the prompt and effective management of malaria cases (a key strategy for reducing the enormous burden of the disease), healthworkers must prescribe antimalarial drugs according to evidence-based guidelines. In sub-Saharan Africa, the guidelines for use in outpatient settings generally recommend that febrile illness in children should be suspected to be malaria and be treated with an antimalarial drug. The quality of treatment offered to febrile children at outpatient facilities in this region has now been investigated in a literature review. The results of five methodologically comparable studies were also used to explore the determinants of malaria-treatment practices. The quality of treatment prescribed to febrile children was found to have been generally sub-optimal, with low levels of adherence to national guidelines, the frequent selection of non-recommended antimalarials, and the use of incorrect dosages. Several factors might be to responsible for these shortcomings. Although interventions such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy can lead to improvements, a better understanding of the practices of the healthworkers responsible for treating febrile children will be needed before treatment is made much better. The failure to provide treatment of good quality will become an increasingly important problem as antimalarial policies involving drugs with more complex dosing regimens, such as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT), are implemented. If the malaria burden in Africa is to be greatly reduced, the deployment of ACT must be accompanied by interventions to ensure the correct treatment of children at the point of care. Some interventions, such as IMCI, can improve the treatment of not only malaria but also other potentially life-threatening illnesses."
CD008122,0,1999454,0,The properdin-like type I repeats of human thrombospondin contain a cell attachment site.,"Thrombospondin (TS) is a modular adhesive glycoprotein that contains three domains previously implicated in the attachment of cells to TS. These include the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain, the carboxy terminal cell or platelet-binding domain, and an RGDA sequence of TS. We have characterized a mAb against human TS, designated A4.1, which inhibits the attachment of human melanoma cells (G361) to TS. The epitope for A4.1 lies within the amino terminal half of the central stalklike region of TS which is distinct from the three known cell attachment sites. This region of TS is recovered in a 50-kD peptide after chymotryptic digestion of TS in EDTA. It contains the procollagen-like domain of TS as well as three type I repeats of a 60-residue segment homologous to two malarial proteins and the complement proteins properdin, and factors C6 through C9. The purified chymotryptic fragment is an effective attachment factor for G361 cells. A4.1 blocks adhesion to the 50-kD domain, as do some sulfated glycoconjugates. RGD (and RGE) peptides and mAbs against other domains of TS are not inhibitory. Peptides (19 mers) based on the core homology sequence of the three type I repeats of TS are potent attachment factors for these cells, and this adhesion is also inhibited by sulfated glycoconjugates. A polyclonal antibody raised against one of these peptides inhibits adhesion of G361 cells to the peptides, to the 50-kD fragment and to intact TS. Thus a new cell-adhesion site has been identified in TS whose sequence is very similar to the site identified in region II of the circumsporozoite protein of malaria parasites (Rich, K. A., F. W. George IV, J. L. Law, and W. J. Martin. 1990. Science (Wash. DC) 249:1574-1577. Thus there may be a common receptor which binds TS, malarial proteins, and properdin."
CD008122,0,6374012,0,Antibodies in malarial sera to parasite antigens in the membrane of erythrocytes infected with early asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum.,"Monolayers of human erythrocytes (E) infected with Plasmodium falciparum were briefly fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and air dried. They were then exposed to sera from patients with P. falciparum malaria or from donors immune to this parasite and tested in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Parasites in infected E were made visible by counterstaining with ethidium bromide. Immunofluorescence (IF) was restricted to the surface of infected E. No antibody binding was detected unless the E were dried, suggesting that the relevant antigens were not available on the outer layers of the E surface. Staining over large parts of the E surface was seen already when the merozoite penetrated noninfected cells and was strong in E containing early stages of the parasite (rings, trophozoites). It was weak or absent from E containing schizonts. Antibodies in sera from different parts of Africa, Colombia, or Sweden reacted similarly with E infected with a Tanzanian P. falciparum strain kept in culture for many years and with parasitized E freshly drawn from African, Swedish, or Colombian patients. All sera from residents of a holoendemic area (Liberia) were IFA positive. In contrast, some sera from Colombian or Swedish patients with primary infection gave negative results. The results of the IFA and of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which fixed and dried E were the targets were well-correlated, suggesting that the same antibodies were detected by these assays. The antigens involved in the IFA were susceptible to pronase but not to trypsin or neuraminidase. E surface IF was inhibited by lysates of infected E, merozoite extracts, or soluble antigens present in P. falciparum culture supernatants but not by lysates of normal E or ghost extracts. The inhibitory antigens were heat stable (100 degrees C, 5 min). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting of either antigen-enriched preparations from culture supernatants or merozoite extracts showed that antibodies eluted from monolayers of infected E reacted consistently with a predominant polypeptide of Mr 155,000 and two to four minor polypeptides of lower molecular weights. Metabolic labeling of the parasites with 75Se-methionine indicated that these antigens were parasite derived. We conclude that the antigens involved in these reactions are released from bursting schizonts or merozoites and are deposited in the E membrane in the course of invasion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008122,0,15857512,0,Expression of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 in experimentally infected humans.,"Parasites causing severe malaria in non-immune patients express a restricted subset of variant surface antigens (VSA), which are better recognized by immune sera than VSA expressed during non-severe disease in semi-immune individuals. The most prominent VSA are the var gene-encoded Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family, which is expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes where it mediates binding to endothelial receptors. Thus, severe malaria may be caused by parasites expressing PfEMP1 variants that afford parasites optimal sequestration in immunologically naive individuals and high effective multiplication rates."

The assay has now been evaluated, against the usual 'gold standard', microscopy, using blood samples from 1655 individuals in five districts of Tanzania, four of which experience frequent malaria outbreaks. The aim was to verify whether Paracheck-Pf could be a reliable tool for the confirmation of malaria outbreaks in such areas. The overall measurements of the assay's performance were good, with a sensitivity of 90.0%, a specificity of 96.6%, a positive predictive value of 88.9%, and a negative predictive value of 97.0% (with an estimated malaria prevalence of 23.3%). There was, however, marked variation between the study districts, the assay's performance being relatively poor where the test had been stored for 12 months at room temperature (23.5+/-3.5 degrees C). The assay was easy to perform in the field and could clearly be a valuable tool in remote areas and in emergency situations, such as the early detection of malaria outbreaks. The cost of the assay (U.S.$0.62/test at the time of the present study) is sufficiently low that its routine use in the confirmation of P. falciparum malaria might also be cost-effective, particularly in areas where there are no facilities for microscopy and/or where the first-line treatment of malaria is based on relatively expensive artemisinin-based combinations."

Estimation of antibodies to P. falciparum or human erythrocytes by means of microELISA.,"An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to estimate disease related antibodies in sera from malaria patients or individuals living in malaria endemic areas. As antigen, Percoll enriched fractions (mainly late trophozoites, schizonts) from Plasmodium falciparum in vitro cultures were used. An ELISA with ghosts from normal human red blood cells (RBC) was performed in parallel. One hundred and seventy-five sera were tested for their reactivity with either one of the two antigens. Seven sera from patients with acute P. falciparum infection were negative. Most of these had been taken very early in infection and consecutive samples taken later usually were positive. The antibodies reacting with the P. falciparum antigen had a high parasite specificity as indicated by inhibition and absorption experiments. Many sera also had elevated levels of antibodies specific for RBC antigens. A correlation, most pronounced in the IgM system, was also seen between the anti-RBC and the anti-P. falciparum antibody levels."

Regular DDT spraying in zones 1 and 3 had been withdrawn 18 months previously. Malariological blood smear surveys of children aged 1-9 years in August 1986 to January 1987 showed a mean baseline malaria parasite rate of 38% (32/84). By February 1988, 18 months after introduction of impregnated bednets, the Plasmodium falciparum infection rate in children was lowest in the zone using impregnated bednets (21% of 29), intermediate in the untreated zone (29% of 34) and highest in the DDT zone (46% of 53), but these differences were not statistically significant. P. vivax infection rates were 9-14%. Using ELISA tests for malaria circumsporozoite antigen in the vectors, overall positivity rates were 0.7% of 49,902 An.farauti and 2.54% of 118 An.punctulatus, comprising 228 P.falciparum and 124 P.vivax infections. In the study zones, vector positivity rates were 0.93% of 31,615 An.farauti in the untreated zone; 0.32% of 16,883 An.farauti in the DDT zone; 0.07% of 1404 An.farauti and 2.54% of 118 An.puctulatus in the impregnated bednet zone. here was no significant correlation between malaria parasite rates in the vectors and the children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The parasite antigen was a trophozoite/schizont enriched preparation of in vitro cultivated P. falciparum. Serum samples were from Swedish malaria patients and adult Liberians. Parasite specific antibodies were found in all four subclasses. Relatively elevated levels of IgG1 antibodies were found both in Swedish patients and in the Liberians. Relative to the Liberians, high IgG2 antibody levels were seen in most Swedish patients. In Liberian sera but not in those from Swedish patients elevated IgG3 levels were found. In two Swedish patients followed consecutively for a period of 15 weeks, elevated levels of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies were seen after relapse. No differences between the groups in regard to the levels of IgG4 antibodies were noticed. The differences between the Swedish patients and the Liberians were also in part reflected by differences in the total amounts of the four IgG subclasses."

A retrospective study of 587 cases].","Using files related to children admitted at the Brazzaville teaching hospital (Congo) between May 1995 and May 2002, the authors have studied the part of sickle cell crisis (SCC) in the sickle cell disease, have assessed the epidemiological particularities, the relation between some clinical, biological factors as well as the severity of the disease. On the whole, 587 SCC have been observed in homozygous SS children aged 6 to 17. The distribution was as follows: painful osteo-articular crisis (58.6%), abdominal crisis (23.5%), acute chest syndrome (14%), neurological strokes (3.2%) and priapism (0.7%). The neurological strokes (75%) and the hand-foot syndrome (77.8%) were predominant in male. As regards the interaction age-localization of the crisis, the hand-foot syndrome mainly concerned children under five, long bones and rachis impairment those aged 11 to 15; abdominal and neurological crisis were observed especially before the age of 10, the acute chest syndrome after 10 (68.3%). Malaria (48.9%) and bacterial or viral infections (24.5%) proved to be the triggering factors when these are identified (188 cases). SCC occurred in 67.5% of the cases during the hot and rainy seasons. Moreover the haemoglobin F rate above 10% was correlated with a low prevalence of SCC, in particular the potentially severe crisis, revealing at the same time its protective value. These results show that SCC, by their frequency and/or their severity constitute a major handicap when the vital prognosis is not involved. Rigorous health habits, appropriate vaccination programme, adequate malarial prophylaxis, optimal transfusional strategy and especially the use of hydroxyurea, prove to be urgent preventive measures to put into practice. Their efficient implementation will provide a better quality of life to the sickle cell patient and will decrease the risks of severe crisis."
CD008122,0,15004879,0,Efficacy of the merozoite surface protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax as an antigen for ELISA to diagnose malaria.,"Malaria is still a major health problem in Thailand and its incidence is currently rising in Korea. To identify a useful antigen for the diagnosis of malaria patients, a cDNA expression library from malaria parasites was constructed and screened out immunologically. One clone was selected in view of its predominant reactivity with the patient sera. The recombinant malaria parasite antigen (Pv30) with 27 kDa as a C-terminal His-tag fusion protein that was produced in Escherichia coli was identified through immunoblot analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence had the sequence homology with the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) genes of Plasmodium falciparum and P. yoelii, each by 41% and 42%, respectively. Measurement of serum IgG and IgM antibody to Pv30 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was evaluated as a serodiagnostic test for malaria patients in Thailand (endemic area) and Korea (recently reemerging area). The sensitivity of P. vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae was 96.3% (26 /27), 90.6% (29/32), and 100% (6/6), respectively, and the specificity was 63.5% (40/63) in Thailand samples. The sensitivity of P. vivax was 98.8% (88/89), and the specificity was 96.6% (86/89) in Korean samples.

Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of histone 2B (PvH2B) gene from the most common but non-cultivable human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. The isolated cDNA clone of PvH2B was allowed to express in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography. The expressed PvH2B protein showed DNA-binding properties on the South-Western analysis and the confocal microscopy localized it in the parasite nucleus. This gene is actively expressed during blood stages of the parasite and all P. vivax patients produced antibodies against the protein. The mRNA of PvH2B was found to contain a poly(A) tail at its 3' end, unlike abundant mRNA of human H2B. The encoded polypeptide is 118 amino acid long contains a nuclear targeting site, a signature motif of H2B and showed 74% homology to its host molecule. The structure of PvH2B showed that it has certain differences from that of its host at critical functional sites (viz acetylation, methylation, trypsin cleavage, DNA-binding and inter-histone interaction) which are required for general gene expression and DNA packaging. The distinctive structural features of P. vivax H2B described here may help in designing the specific antimalarial drugs."

CD008122,0,1973949,0,The medical importance of riceland mosquitoes and their control using alternatives to chemical insecticides.,"The medical importance, ecology and control of riceland mosquitoes using alternative strategies is reviewed. Over 135 pest and vector anopheline and culicine mosquito species found in association with riceland habitats and their medical importance are presented. Malaria and Japanese encephalitis are the two most serious human diseases transmitted by riceland mosquitoes, but they have been incriminated as vectors of dozens of arboviruses and other parasites and pathogens including the causal agents of West Nile and Rift Valley Fevers and lymphatic filariasis. Control of vector and pest mosquitoes using chemical pesticides has generated several problems including: insecticide resistance, safety risks for humans and domestic animals, and other environmental concerns. These problems and the high cost and sustainability of programs based predominantly on conventional insecticides have stimulated increased interest in integrated control measures in ricelands. The integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for mosquito control, also known as integrated vector control (IVC), is an ecologically based approach that may involve several complementary interventions used in combination or singly. Environmental management, and chemical, biological and mechanical control, comprise the elements of IVC proposed for use in or near riceland habitats. Some of the elements of environmental management include the use of intermittent irrigation; flushing of fields; use of rice cultivars that require less water; shifting of planting schedules to avoid optimal mosquito breeding conditions; relocation of communities or use of dry belt farming around them; and zooprophylaxis and other personal protection methods, especially use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets. Biological control agents that have been used successfully in rice fields include several species of larvivorous fish, a mermithid nematode (Romanomermis culicivorax), a fungus (Lagenidium giganteum) and bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis and Bacillus sphaericus). The mermithid and the entomopathogens have demonstrated little or no adverse effects on populations of vertebrate and invertebrate nontarget organisms. The successful use of any particular method or combination of interventions for the control of riceland mosquitoes will depend on in-depth ecological studies on the target species and nontarget organisms, sound geographic reconnaissance and effective routine sampling and evaluation. When biological control agents are considered, additional background on the environmental factors limiting their efficacy will also be needed. In addition to the technical components of the various interventions employed in integrated control, sustained suppression of riceland mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit will require a greater sociocultural supportive background, particularly in developing countries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Antibodies reach maximum levels to RAP1 after the age of 15 but to RAP2 only after the age of 30. The effect of HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 and age on levels of antibody to rRAP1 and rRAP2 was analyzed with a multiple regression model in which all HLA alleles and age were independent variables. DQB1*0301 and -*03032 showed an age-dependent association with levels of antibody to rRAP1, being significant in children 5 to 15 years (P < 0.001) but not in individuals over 15 years of age. DRB1*03011 showed an age-dependent association with antibody levels to rRAP2; however, this association was in adults over the age of 30 years (P < 0.01) but not in individuals under the age of 30 years. No associations were detected between DRB1 alleles and RAP1 antibody levels or between DQB1 alleles and RAP2 antibody levels. Thus, not only the HLA allele but also the age at which an interaction is manifested varies for different malarial antigens. The interaction may influence either the rate of acquisition of antibody or the final level of antibody acquired by adults."

Senegal were analysed by Thick smear microscopy, the QBC, PCR and the new dipstick PATH Malaria assay which detects the histidine rich protein II antigen of Plasmodium falciparum. Thick smear microscopy was used as the reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive and negative values were 100%, 83.6%, 93.4% and 100% QBC respectively; 100%, 72.7%, 89.4% and 100% for PCR; 96%, 92.7%, 96.8% and 91% for the PATH assay. PATH assay failed to detect one positive sample with Plasmodium malariae. Assays were also compared with regard to the expense of equipment and reagents and speed and ease of use. The rapid PATH assay can be performed with minimal training and may be specially useful in areas where P. falciparum is the predominant malaria species, in epidemic malaria regions, and where skilled microscopy is not readily available."
CD008122,0,16333084,0,Diagnostic accuracy of two rK39 antigen-based dipsticks and the formol gel test for rapid diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in northeastern Uganda.,"The development of an accurate, practical, and affordable diagnostic test is essential to improve the management of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in remote health centers. We evaluated the Formol Gel test (FGT) and two rK39 antigen-based dipsticks, the DUAL-IT L/M, and the Kalazar Detect for VL diagnosis in Amudat Hospital in Uganda. The DUAL-IT L/M was also evaluated for the diagnosis of malaria. All patients clinically suspect of VL were prospectively included in the study between October 2003 and March 2004. The gold standard used to define a VL case was a positive spleen aspirate or a direct agglutination test titer of >1:12,800 with an appropriate clinical response to antileishmanial therapy. A total of 131 VL and 112 non-VL patients were included in the analysis. The DUAL IT L/M was found to be more sensitive than the Kalazar Detect: 97% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 92 to 99%) versus 82% (95%CI = 74 to 87%). The Kalazar Detect and the DUAL IT L/M were highly specific (99% [95%CI = 95 to 100%] and 97% [95%CI = 92 to 99%], respectively). The FGT lacked both sensitivity (66% [95%CI = 57 to 73%]) and specificity (90% [95%CI = 83 to 94%]). The sensitivity of the DUAL IT L/M for malaria was only 57% (95%CI = 37 to 76%). The two rK39 dipsticks can be used for diagnostic confirmation of VL in this region. The DUAL-IT L/M without its malaria diagnostic component (DiaMed-IT LEISH) will be adopted as first-line test for VL in Uganda."

CD008122,0,16088837,0,Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and its effect on the performance of PfHRP2-based rapid diagnostic tests.,"Rising costs of antimalarial agents are increasing the demand for accurate diagnosis of malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer great potential to improve the diagnosis of malaria, particularly in remote areas. Many RDTs are based on the detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein (PfHRP) 2, but reports from field tests have questioned their sensitivity and reliability. We hypothesize that the variability in the results of PfHRP2-based RDTs is related to the variability in the target antigen. We tested this hypothesis by examining the genetic diversity of PfHRP2, which includes numerous amino acid repeats, in 75 P. falciparum lines and isolates originating from 19 countries and testing a subset of parasites by use of 2 PfHRP2-based RDTs. We observed extensive diversity in PfHRP2 sequences, both within and between countries. Logistic regression analysis indicated that 2 types of repeats were predictive of RDT detection sensitivity (87.5% accuracy), with predictions suggesting that only 84% of P. falciparum parasites in the Asia-Pacific region are likely to be detected at densities < or = 250 parasites/microL. Our data also indicated that PfHRP3 may play a role in the performance of PfHRP2-based RDTs. These findings provide an alternative explanation for the variable sensitivity in field tests of malaria RDTs that is not due to the quality of the RDTs."
CD008122,0,19419588,0,Fighting malaria in Madhya Pradesh (Central India): are we losing the battle?,"Malaria control in Madhya Pradesh is complex because of vast tracts of forest with tribal settlement. Fifty four million individuals of various ethnic origins, accounting for 8% of the total population of India, contributed 30% of total malaria cases, 60% of total falciparum cases and 50% of malaria deaths in the country. Ambitious goals to control tribal malaria by launching ""Enhanced Malaria Control Project"" (EMCP) by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), with the World Bank assistance, became effective in September 1997 in eight north Indian states. Under EMCP, the programme used a broader mix of new interventions, i.e. insecticide-treated bed nets, spraying houses with effective residual insecticides, use of larvivorous fishes, rapid diagnostic tests for prompt diagnosis, treatment of the sick with effective radical treatment and increased public awareness and IEC. However, the challenge is to scale up these services.A retrospective analysis of data on malaria morbidity and associated mortality reported under the existing surveillance system of the Madhya Pradesh (Central India) for the years 1996-2007 was carried out to determine the impact of EMCP on malaria morbidity and associated mortality. Analysis revealed that despite the availability of effective intervention tools for the prevention and control of malaria, falciparum malaria remains uncontrolled and deaths due to malaria have increased. Precisely, the aim of this epidemiological analysis is to draw lessons applicable to all international aid efforts, bureaucracy, policy makers and programme managers in assessing its project performance as a new Global Malaria Action Plan is launched with ambitious goal of reducing malaria and its elimination by scaling up the use of existing tools."
CD008122,0,11005815,0,Structural requirements for the adherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of human placenta.,"Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy results in the accumulation of infected red blood cells (IRBCs) in the placenta, leading to poor pregnancy outcome. In the preceding paper (Achur, R. N., Valiyaveettil, M., Alkhalil, A., Ockenhouse, C. F., and Gowda, D. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 40344-40356), we reported that unusually low sulfated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the intervillous spaces of the placenta mediate the IRBC adherence. In this study, we report the structural requirements for the adherence and the minimum chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) structural motif that supports IRBC adherence. Partially sulfated C4Ss with varying sulfate contents were prepared by solvolytic desulfation of a fully sulfated C4S. These and other nonmodified C4Ss, with different proportions of 4-, 6-, and nonsulfated disaccharide repeats, were analyzed for inhibition of IRBC adherence to the placental CSPG. C4Ss containing 30-50% 4-sulfated and 50-70% nonsulfated disaccharide repeats efficiently inhibited IRBC adherence; C6S had no inhibitory activity. Oligosaccharides of varying sizes were prepared by the partial depolymerization of C4Ss containing varying levels of 4-sulfation, and their ability to inhibit the IRBC adherence was studied. Oligosaccharides with six or more disaccharide repeats inhibited IRBC adherence to the same level as that of the intact C4Ss, indicating that a dodecasaccharide is the minimum structural motif required for optimal IRBC adherence. Of the C4S dodecasaccharides, only those with two or three sulfate groups per molecule showed maximum IRBC inhibition. These data define the structural requirements for the IRBC adherence to placental CSPGs with implications for the development of therapeutics for maternal malaria."
CD008122,0,8627087,0,Big endothelin in patients with complicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Plasma concentrations of big endothelin-1 were determined by ELISA in 18 patients with complicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Bangkok. Before therapy, elevated levels were recorded (21 +/- 12 vs. 2.9 +/- 1.1 pmol/L in age- and sex-matched healthy subjects; P < .001). Even 7 days after therapy, elevated concentrations were seen (25 +/- 14 pmol/L). Plasma endothelin levels were correlated with levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (r = .632, P < .01), and a negative correlation with platelet counts was seen (r = .783, P < .005). No relation between plasma endothelin concentrations and parasitemia, fever, or other indices of severe infection (hypotension, renal, hepatic or pulmonary impairment, cerebral malaria) existed. During and after complicated malaria, increased levels of plasma endothelin could contribute to malarial pathology or reflect endothelial damage or both."

CD008122,0,12788305,0,"Modulation of immune response in Plasmodium falciparum malaria: role of IL-12, IL-18 and TGF-beta.","The interaction between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 12 (IL-12), interleukin 18 (IL-18) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) plays an important role in malaria pathogenesis and outcome, modulating the immunoresponse in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In our previous studies, we analyzed the plasmatic levels of IL-12, IL-18 and TGF-beta in 105 African children with different degrees of malaria and we correlated the production of these cytokines with the severity of the disease. The aim of the present study was to analyze with a mathematical model, taking into account all the relationships between these cytokines and the parameter variations involved in malaria pathogenesis that influence the results of each type of treatment or therapeutic protocol on patients at different stages of the disease. A mathematical correlation was demonstrated between the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and from this it was possible to build curves of reference in which each patient was positioned based on IL-12 level. Our data, obtained in patients with mild and severe diseases, demonstrate that the levels of IL-12 represent a reliable parameter to predict the progression of the disease, which may be complemented or modulated by administration of IL-18 and TGF-beta. Our findings provide future implications for an immune therapy against the P. falciparum malaria infection, especially in the early phase of the disease showing that a more aggressive outcome may be due to the lack of a balanced immune response."

The copolymer composition in polymeric coatings was confirmed by proton NMR spectroscopy. Various techniques like FTIR, SEM and contact angle were used for surface characterization of the polymer coatings. These polymer coated strips were evaluated and standardized for their application in dot-ELISA in two steps. In first step, specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay on developed polymer coated strips was evaluated through a model system using rabbit anti-goat IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugate. Polymer coating with GMA-NVP mol% ratio of 78:22 was able to detect rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody at a concentration as low as 2 ng mL(-1) with 1% BSA as blocking agent using antispecies IgG peroxidase conjugate diluted 1500 times. In the second step, the sensitivity and specificity of the developed system was established with human blood and finally used to identify the source of mosquito blood meal which is an important parameter in epidemiological studies, particularly in determining the role of mosquito in malaria transmission. The time duration of standardized assay with developed polymer coated strips was cut down to one hour compared to the 3-4h required in usual dot-ELISA."

CD008122,0,15331827,0,Urbanization in sub-saharan Africa and implication for malaria control.,"Malaria not only remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, but it also impedes socioeconomic development, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Rapid and unprecedented urbanization, going hand-in-hand with often declining economies, might have profound implications for the epidemiology and control of malaria, as the relative disease burden increases among urban dwellers. Reviewing the literature and using a modeling approach, we find that entomologic inoculation rates in cities range from 0 to 54 per year, depending on the degree of urbanization, the spatial location within a city, and overall living conditions. Using the latest United Nations figures on urbanization prospects, nighttime light remotely sensed images, and the ""Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa"" results on climate suitability for stable malaria transmission, we estimate that 200 million people (24.6% of the total African population) currently live in urban settings where they are at risk of contracting the disease. Importantly, the estimated total surface area covered by these urban settings is only approximately 1.1-1.6% of the total African surface. Considering different plausible scenarios, we estimate an annual incidence of 24.8-103.2 million cases of clinical malaria attacks among urban dwellers in Africa. These figures translate to 6-28% of the estimated global annual disease incidence. Against this background, basic health care delivery systems providing early diagnosis and early treatment and preventive actions through mother and child health programs and the promotion of insecticide-treated bed nets for the rapidly growing numbers of the urban poor must be improved alongside well-tailored and integrated malaria control strategies. We propose environmental management and larviciding within well-specified productive sites as a main feature for such an integrated control approach. Mitigation of the current burden of malaria in urban African settings, in turn, is a necessity for stimulating environmentally and socially sustainable development."

CD008122,0,1956698,0,Genetic control of the immune response to a synthetic vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum.,"Two independent vaccination trials using a hybrid synthetic polypeptide containing epitopes from four proteins of Plasmodium falciparum were performed. In the first trial 63 and in the second 122 volunteers were vaccinated, using different immunization schedules. The analysis of the humoral response to the vaccine, measured by IgG antibody titres to the polypeptide showed a bimodal distribution in both cases suggesting genetic control of the immune response to this protein. There was a small group of low or non-responders and a large group of good responders. HLA phenotyping of the two groups disclosed an association of the low responders to HLA-DR4 antigens with chi-square P value of 0.00039 when compared with the good responders group. These findings provide evidence for the genetic control of the immune response to the synthetic vaccine by the association of this response with particular alleles of the HLA class II antigens; such findings may lead to an explanation of the mechanism involved in disease susceptibility and need to be used in the design of a totally effective vaccine."
CD008122,0,12971513,0,Field application and evaluation of a rapid immunochromatographic test for detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection among the inhabitants of Lao PDR.,"Field application and evaluation of a rapid immunochromatographic test (ICT) for detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection were performed in 13 villages in a southern province of Lao PDR in 1999. More than 2,000 inhabitants, accounting for 61.8% of the total estimated population, were examined. Malaria infection was confirmed in all villages surveyed by ICT and microscopic diagnosis. The positive rates of P. falciparum malaria by microscopy ranged from 9.7% to 59.2% (mean 27.2%), whereas by ICT they were from 11.6% to 64.5% (mean 29.8%). The positive rates by ICT were generally higher in 8 out of 13 villages. However, a significant difference between the positive rates by microscopy and ICT was not observed in all villages. Plasmodium falciparum infection was actually confirmed by microscopy in 84.1% of specimens that tested positive by ICT. The results by ICT were consistent with those of the microscopic diagnosis, the discrepancy of the results was less than 10% (141/2,066). The ICT was falsely-positive in 4.7% and falsely-negative in 2.1% of the test cases. These results showed the efficacy of ICT not only in the diagnosis of the respective cases, but also in the mass-examination in the field."

The sensitivity and specificity of the test was found to be 97 and 100 per cent respectively. The persistence of the antigen varied from 5 to 15 days after initiation of antimalarial therapy. The assay was simple to perform, rapid and easy to interpret. However, infection due to other species of human malaria parasites cannot be detected by this dipstick assay.

CD008122,0,9091864,0,[Malaria: what treatment today?].,"Morbidity and mortality due to malaria remains an important health problem for travelers visiting endemic zones. In this population, typical episodes of chills and fever followed by diaphoresis are not always observed; inaugural signs may limited to low-grade fever accompanying digestive disorders. Early diagnosis is nevertheless essential to prevent progression to acute pernicious malaria. Blood smears, quantitative butty coat (QBC) test or the Parasight test can give rapid diagnosis. Chloroquine is the drug of choice for Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale or P. Malariae infection, but chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum is widespread in tropical zones and resistant P. vivax has been reported in Indonesia. Currently, halofantrine is the best treatment for P. falciparum infection, although cardiac toxicity may occur in patients with a long QT on the electrocardiogram. Mefloquine can be alternative. The sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination is also used in many tropical zones because of its low cost and availability, but many resistant strains of P. falciparum have been identified. Use of quinine is also widespread in tropical zones. This basic antimalarial is rapidly effective but is also rapidly eliminated, necessitating repeated oral doses. Intramuscular injection may provoke necrosis. The main indication for quinine is acute pernicious P. falciparum malaria, but the drug is also used for simple episodes of fever in many tropical zones. Symptomatic care including fluid replacement, oxygen, transfusion, diuretics, respiratory assistance and dialysis may also be required in some cases. Use of corticosteroids or exsanguinotransfusion remains a question of debate. When administered rapidly, fever should regress within a few days. Neurological sequellae are exceptional after acute pernicious malaria in adults but may occur approximately 5% of children, emphasizing the importance of associating chemoprophylaxis and protection against insect bites. There has been much publicity concerning a vaccine, but results to date have been disappointing."

CD008122,0,15672556,0,Drug resistance in malaria.,"Ever since the discovery of the first case of chloroquine resistance along the Thai-Combodian border in the late 1950s, Southeast Asia has played an important role as a focus for the development of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. Although the first case of quinine resistance had been reported much earlier from South America, the onset of chloroquine resistance marked the beginning of a new chapter in the history of malaria in Southeast Asia and by 1973 chloroquine finally had to be replaced by the combination of sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine (SP) as first line drug for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Thailand and more than 10 African countries have also switched their first line drug to SP. In 1985, eventually SP was replaced by mefloquine. The rapid development of resistance to this new drug leads to the introduction of artemisinin as a combination drug in the mid-1990s. It is mandatory to mention here that therapeutic regimens for prevention and treatment of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum are associated with higher costs and side-effects compared to chloroquine. Additionally, some of these alternative treatments are associated with more side-effects, take longer time for cure and are more difficult to comply with than chloroquine. Urgent efforts are needed to identify effective, affordable, alternative antimalarial regimens. Molecular markers for antimalarial resistance have been identified, including pfmdr-1 and pfcrt polymorphisms associated with chloroquine resistance and dhfr and dhps polymorphisms associated with SP resistance. Polymorphisms in pfmdr-1 may also be associated with resistance to chloroquine, mefloquine and artemisinin. Use of such genetic information for the early detection of resistance foci and future monitoring of drug resistant malaria is a potentially useful epidemiological tool, in conjunction with the conventional in vitro and in vivo drug sensitivity assessments. The purpose of this review is to describe the state of knowledge regarding drug resistant malaria and to outline the changing patterns of drug resistance including its determinants, current status in diverse geographical areas, molecular markers and their implications to limit the advent, spread and intensification of drug resistant malaria."

Anophelines were captured on human bait and by pyrethrum spray collections. The mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles gambiae complex were identified using the polymerase chain reaction. Malaria vectors captured were An. funestus, An. arabiensis, and An. gambiae. Anopheles funestus was the most abundant mosquito captured the first year, An. arabiensis in the following years. The annual entomologic inoculation rates calculated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were 238, 89, and 150 for the first, second, and third years, respectively. Each year there was a peak of transmission at the end of the rainy season, but transmission occurred year round. The heterogeneity of transmission was found at four different levels: 1) the relative vector proportion according to the place and method of capture, 2) the human biting rate and relative proportion of vectors by month and year, 3) the infection rate of each vector by year, and 4) the number of infected bites for all vectors, and for each species, for the year. Our data show that even in areas of intense and perennial transmission, there exist large longitudinal variations and strong heterogeneity in entomologic parameters of malaria transmission. It is important to take these into account for the study of the variations in clinical and biological parameters of human malaria, and to evaluate this relationship, a very thorough investigation of transmission is necessary."

The level of exposure to malaria transmission of 205 soldiers deployed in Africa and the efficacy of their anti-vector prophylaxis was evaluated by comparison of their IgM and IgG responses against five pre-erythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum antigens (circumsporozoite protein, sporozoite threonine- and asparagine-rich protein, sporozoite- and liver-stage antigen, liver stage antigen 1, and SR11.1) before and at the end of their deployment, and three months after returning to France for 106 of these soldiers. The immune responses increased significantly during the mission in 35% (95% confidence interval = 28-42%) of the individuals.

CD008122,0,1688287,0,"[Longitudinal study on malaria transmission and biology of vectors in the island of Sainte Marie, on the east coast of Madagascar, from 1988 to 1990].","A 17-month longitudinal malaria survey was carried out in Sainte Marie Island, on the East Coast of Madagascar, from November 1988 to March 1990. During 706 man-nights of captures, 46401 mosquitoes belonging to 32 species were caught. Sporozoïte rates were calculated by Elisa. The malaria vectors were Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, An. funestus and An. mascarensis. An. gambiae was the main vector. It was highly anthropophilic and partially exophilic. Transmission by this species mainly occurred from November to April, monthly sporozoïte antigene positivity rate varied from 0 to 3.85. The annual inoculation rate was about 100 infecting bites per man, in which 92 by Plasmodium falciparum. An. funestus intervened weakly in transmission. An. mascarensis, a malagasy endemic region anopheline is a newly discovered vector. The observed sporozoïte rate varied from 0.4 to 0.9 between September and March 1990. Parasite indexes in human fluctuated during the year from 64 to 80%. Because of the high level of transmission, recommendations for inhabitants and tourists are proposed."
CD008122,0,14695831,0,Effects of bisphosphonates on the growth of Entamoeba histolytica and Plasmodium species in vitro and in vivo.,"The effects of a series of 102 bisphosphonates on the inhibition of growth of Entamoeba histolytica and Plasmodium falciparum in vitro have been determined, and selected compounds were further investigated for their in vivo activity. Forty-seven compounds tested were active (IC(50) < 200 microM) versus E. histolytica growth in vitro. The most active compounds (IC(50) approximately 4-9 microM) were nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates with relatively large aromatic side chains. Simple n-alkyl-1-hydroxy-1,1-bisphosphonates, known inhibitors of the enzyme farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) synthase, were also active, with optimal activity being found with C9-C10 side chains. However, numerous other nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates known to be potent FPP synthase inhibitors, such as risedronate or pamidronate, had little or no activity. Several pyridine-derived bisphosphonates were quite active (IC(50) approximately 10-20 microM), and this activity was shown to correlate with the basicity of the aromatic group, with activity decreasing with increasing pK(a) values. The activities of all compounds were tested versus a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (KB) cell line to enable an estimate of the therapeutic index (TI). Five bisphosphonates were selected and then screened for their ability to delay the development of amebic liver abscess formation in an E. histolytica infected hamster model. Two compounds were found to decrease liver abscess formation at 10 mg/kg ip with little or no effect on normal liver mass. With P. falciparum, 35 compounds had IC(50) values <200 microM in an in vitro assay. The most active compounds were also simple n-alkyl-1-hydroxy-1,1-bisphosphonates, having IC(50) values around 1 microM. Five compounds were again selected for in vivo investigation in a Plasmodium berghei ANKA BALB/c mouse suppressive test. The most active compound, a C9 n-alkyl side chain containing bisphosphonate, caused an 80% reduction in parasitemia with no overt toxicity. Taken together, these results show that bisphosphonates appear to be useful lead compounds for the development of novel antiamebic and antimalarial drugs."
CD008122,0,16878344,0,Rapid gas chromatography/mass spectrometry quinine determination in plasma after automated solid-phase extraction.,"The combined use of an automatic solid-phase extraction (SPE) apparatus with Oasis MCX cartridges and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to rapidly quantify quinine in biological samples with cyproheptadine as the internal standard is described. The selected ion monitoring mode, with the quantification ions m/z 136 and 287 (qualifier ions: m/z 261, 381 and 215, 96), allows the estimation of quinine levels, respectively. Separation was completed within 12.7 min. Excellent linearity was found up to 10 000 microg/L of plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) was 12.2 microg/L and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 40.6 microg/L. High reproducibility (intra-assay CV range 1.9-4.3%, inter-assay CV range 2.2-11.3%) and accuracy values (intra-assay range 83.2-103.7%, inter-assay range 86.8-103.7%) were obtained. Recoveries were concentration-independent (97.2% and 89.8% for 4000 and 10 000 microg/L, respectively). This sensitive, simple assay for quinine in various matrices meets the current requirements for bioanalytical assays and may be used to monitor quinine levels in patients developing severe malaria with acute renal failure during hemofiltration. The optimal quinine dose in this situation is not really established and to improve clinical care, quinine concentrations might be explored to improve efficacy and minimise potential toxicity."
CD008122,0,11414465,0,Application of yeast enolase as antigen for immunodiagnosis of malaria.,"In 1998, we reported that Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) enolase was useful as the capture antigen for the immunodiagnosis of malaria. In the present study, we modified a fluorescence-ELISA for the diagnosis of malaria by applying yeast enolase or rabbit muscle enolase as antigen. Sera from 67 falciparum malaria patients and 15 vivax malaria patients were tested by the method. Positivity rates of the former was 82.1% against yeast enolase antigen and 90.5% against rabbit muscle enolase antigen, and those of latter was 93.3% against both enolase antigens. Mean antibody level (RFU values) of sera from falciparum and vivax malaria patients were significantly higher than those from healthy individuals. There was a significant correlation between anti-yeast and anti-rabbit muscle enolase antibody level (RFU values) in the group of falciparum subjects (r = 0.401, p<0.001). A significant correlation between RFU values against yeast enolase antigen and indirect fluorescent antibody titers against crude Pf antigen in the same subjects was recognized (r = 0.518, p<0.001). Longitudinal changes of RFU values against yeast enolase for the following 4 weeks after admission were also examined for sera from falciparum malaria patients. Patients with more severe malaria showed increasing RFU values as the clinical courses progressed. However, in the mild cases, each RFU value stayed unchanged during the course. We concluded that yeast and rabbit muscle enolase could be appropriately used as antigen for the immunodiagnosis of malaria."
CD008122,0,15748051,0,Estimation of malaria transmission in high-risk provinces of Morocco.,"The malaria transmission level of Plasmodium vivax was monitored in four high-risk provinces in Morocco. Intensive mosquito collection by light traps and manual catches resulted in the capture of four species: Anopheles labranchiae, An. sergenti, An. cinereus, and An. claviger. All An. sergenti and An. labranchiae females collected were tested for the presence of two phenotypes of P. vivax (PVK210 and PVK247) antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No P. vivax antigen was detected in 1347 mosquitoes analysed. A parallel parasitological investigation was conducted. Of 2665 slides examined from a population of 4343 people for detection of P. vivax, no slide was positive. The results confirm the break in malaria transmission in residual foci. The use of ELISA is recommended in future epidemiological studies of human malaria."
CD008122,0,19201653,0,Do malaria parasites follow the algebra of sex ratio theory?,"The ratio of male to female gametocytes seen in infections of Plasmodium and related haemosporidian parasites varies substantially, both within and among parasite species. Sex ratio theory, a mainstay of evolutionary biology, accounts for this variation. The theory provides an algebraic solution for the optimal sex ratio that will maximize parasite fitness. A crucial term in this solution is the probability of selfing by clone-mates within the vector (based on the clone number and their relative abundance). Definitive tests of the theory have proven elusive because of technical challenges in measuring clonal diversity within infections. Newly developed molecular methods now provide opportunities to test the theory with an exquisite precision."
CD008122,0,9463665,0,TrypTect CIATT--a card indirect agglutination trypanosomiasis test for diagnosis of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infections.,"A simple and rapid test, the card indirect agglutination trypanosomiasis test (TrypTect CIATT) is described, for detecting circulating antigens in persons suffering from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infection by latex agglutination. The sensitivity of the test (95.8% for T. b. gambiense and 97.7% for T. b. rhodesiense) was significantly higher than that of lymph node puncture, microhaematocrit centrifugation and cerebrospinal fluid examination after single and double centrifugation. The specificity of the test was also high: 106 blood donor sera as well as sera from 37 patients with malaria, 25 with visceral leishmaniasis, 10 with schistosomiasis, 5 with filariasis and 10 with hydatid disease, from trypanosomiasis-free areas, gave negative results. Eighteen clinical suspects from active disease transmission foci, without microscopically detectable parasitaemia but with a positive test result, were further examined by lumbar puncture and inoculation of blood into mice; 11 (61%) were found to be infected, suggesting that the test had a high positive predictive value. This study showed that TrypTect CIATT is a useful test for rapid diagnosis of both patent and non-patent T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infections."
CD008122,0,17433301,0,Real-time PCR versus conventional PCR for malaria parasite detection in low-grade parasitemia.,"We have optimized a faster and cheaper real-time PCR and developed a conventional genus specific PCR based on 18S rRNA gene to detect malaria parasites in low-grade parasitemias. Additionally, we compared these PCRs to the OptiMAL-IT test. Since there is no consensus on choice of standard quantitative curve in real-time assays, we decided to investigate the performance of parasite DNA from three different sources: ""genome"", amplicon and plasmid. The amplicon curve showed the best efficiency in quantifying parasites. Both PCR assays detected 100% of the clinical samples tested; the sensitivity threshold was 0.5 parasite/mul and no PCR positive reaction occurred when malaria parasites were not present. Conversely, if OptiMAL-IT were employed for malaria diagnosis, 30% of false-negative results could be expected. We conclude that PCR assays have potential for detecting malaria parasites in asymptomatic infections, in evaluation of malaria vaccine molecule candidates, for screening blood donors, especially in endemic areas, or even in monitoring malaria therapy."
CD008122,0,17050066,0,Development of an automated malaria discriminant factor using VCS technology.,"Malaria diagnosis presents a challenge to all laboratories. There is a need for rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective screening on all samples, particularly in areas where malaria is endemic. Response to malaria infection involves an increased monocyte count and production of large activated monocytes. These changes can be detected by volume, conductivity, and scatter (VCS) technology on certain automated blood cell counters (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). The SD of the volume of lymphocytes and monocytes demonstrates a significant difference from normal when malaria is present. By using a calculation derived from the SD volume of the lymphocytes and monocytes, herein termed the malaria factor, sensitivity of 98% and specificity 94% were demonstrated for the detection of malaria. Based on this derived discriminant, VCS technology should become a useful tool in the detection of malaria. A flag to indicate the potential presence of malaria could then be generated by the instrument if the user or manufacturer chose to do so."
CD008122,0,19622411,0,Chapter 5. Potential contribution of sero-epidemiological analysis for monitoring malaria control and elimination: historical and current perspectives.,"Anti-malarial antibody responses represent an individual's history of exposure to the disease and, as age sero-conversion rates, reflect cumulative malaria exposure in a population. As such these antibody responses are an alternate measure of malaria transmission intensity and have potential in evaluating changes in exposure. This approach was used in the 1970s to evaluate malaria control and eradication attempts in a variety of different ecological settings. These historical studies provided a wealth of information on how serological data might be used to interpret control measures. However they were limited by a lack of standardized antigens and reproducible high-throughput assays. Current techniques using recombinant antigens with a range of immunogenicities, high-throughput enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and statistical analysis allow a more robust examination of how serological parameters can be used to evaluate factors affecting malaria transmission. Here we present a review of the historical data and use it to assess the serological contribution to monitoring malaria elimination."
CD008122,0,7528968,0,Antibodies to ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (Pf155/RESA) protect against P. falciparum parasitemia in highly exposed multigravidas women in Malawi.,"To determine whether antibodies to defined B-cell epitopes of Plasmodium falciparum antigens were related to protection against parasitemic attacks in highly exposed pregnant women, two samples of 235 with no initial P. falciparum parasitemia (NP) and 89 multigravidas who presented initial P. falciparum parasitemia (IP) were enrolled in an antimalarial prophylaxis trial in the Mangochi District in Malawi. Sera were collected under effective prophylaxis and tested for antibody measurement using FAST-ELISA. Mean antibody titers to synthetic peptides reproducing the 3 major B-cell epitopes of the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (Pf155/RESA), as (EENV)4, (EENVEHDA)4 and (DDEHVEEPTVA)3, were higher in the NP than in the IP multigravidas, and this remained consistent within the season of malaria transmission (all p < 0.05). All antibodies to Pf155/RESA were positively intercorrelated within each group. Mean antibody titers to peptide (PNAN)5 reproducing the major B-cell epitope of the circumsporozoite protein (CS protein) were similar between NP and IP multigravidas in both dry and rainy season. Antibodies to Pf155/RESA epitopes may contribute to immune protection against blood-stage parasite multiplication in these highly malaria-exposed pregnant women."
CD008122,0,15490787,1,Malaria diagnosis: false negative parasight-F tests in falciparum malaria patients in Nigeria.,"This study was designed to assess the relative reliability of microscopy, the dipstick technique based on the detection of Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine rich protein II (HRPII) (Parasight-F) and PCR assays in diagnosing falciparum malaria infections in Nigerian children. The prevalence of P. falciparum infections in enrolled patients was 100% by microscopy. Parasite density ranged from 329 to 81,194 parasites/microL of blood, with a geometric mean parasite density of 5168 parasites/microL of blood. The sensitivity of the HRPII based dipstick, PCR and microscopy were 80%, 92% and 100% respectively. A false negative rate of 20% was observed with Parasight-F as compared with microscopy. The parasitemia in patients with false negative Parasight-F tests ranged from 319 to 54,680 parasites/microL of blood. Detailed PCR analysis of Isolates obtained from five out of the eight patients who exhibited a negative Parasight-F test, showed that the average numbers of P. falciparum clones in these five isolates were: 1.7 +/- 1.02 with MSPI, 3.2 +/- 1.3 with MSP2 and 1.4 +/- 1.72 with GLURP. Comparison of microscopy and HRPII results showed a significant (p=0.009) difference as opposed to microscopy and PCR (p=0.239). This study showed that caution should be exercised when excluding P. falciparum infections on the basis of HRPII based dipstick results alone. Microscopy or PCR diagnosis where possible, should be carried out in order to confirm negative P. falciparum HRPII-based dipstick tests."
CD008122,0,9754317,1,"Diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria using ParaSight F, ICT malaria PF and malaria IgG CELISA assays.","A battery of sixty-six blood samples from Senegal was analysed by the ParaSight F test, the ICT Malaria PF and the Malaria IgG CELISA. These three assays detect the histidine rich protein 2 antigen of Plasmodium falciparum. Thick smear microscopy was used as the reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive and negative values were respectively 89%, 100%, 100%, 88% for the ICT; 86%, 93%, 94%, 85% for the paraSight and 88%, 87%, 88%, 87% for the Malaria IgG CELISA. The three assays failed to detect two positive samples with P. ovale and P. malariae. Assays were also compared with regard to the expense of equipment and reagents and speed and ease of use. The rapid ICT and ParaSight F test can be performed with minimal training and may be specially useful in areas where P. falciparum is the predominant malaria species, in epidemic malaria regions, and where skilled microscopy is not readily available."

CD008122,0,14688109,0,Effects of anti-endothelial cell antibodies in leprosy and malaria.,"As a result of damaging endothelial cells (ECs), Mycobacterium leprae triggers the production of antibodies (Abs). These anti-EC Abs (AECAs) can be divided into two types. The first type nonspecifically reacts with components of the cytosol (CY) and can be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The second specifically reacts with the EC membrane (MB) and requires fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to be detected. The presence of both types of AECAs was determined in 68 leprosy patients. The ELISA was positive for 35 of them but also for 30 of 34 malaria patients and 17 of 50 healthy African controls. However, whereas FACS analysis showed MB reactivity in only three malaria patients and four controls, this reactivity was found in 27 leprosy patients, more of those having the lepromatous than the tuberculoid form. Specificity for MB, which we failed to absorb by incubation with CY lysates, predominated over that for CY in leprosy, unlike malaria, where the EC reactivity was restricted to the CY. Western blot analysis and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that calreticulin, vimentin, tubulin, and heat shock protein 70 were targeted by AECAs from leprosy patients, but other proteins remained unidentified. These auto-Abs, but not those from malaria patients, did activate ECs, as indicated by the E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 upregulation, and/or induced them into apoptosis, as documented by four different methods. Our findings suggest that, in some but not all leprosy patients, AECAs may play a role in pathogenesis."
CD008122,0,11388505,1,"Performance of the OptiMAL assay for detection and identification of malaria infections in asymptomatic residents of Irian Jaya, Indonesia.","The OptiMAL assay, a new immunochromatographic ""dipstick"" test for malaria based on detection of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), is purported to detect infections of approximately 200 parasites/microL of blood and to differentiate between Plasmodium falciparum and non-P. falciparum. We evaluated OptiMAL performance by comparing the test strip interpretations of two independent readers with consensus results obtained independently by expert malaria microscopists. Unbiased measures of sensitivity were derived by applying the OptiMAL test for detection and differentiation of light, asymptomatic infections by P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. OptiMAL readings were separated in time to determine whether the reaction signal was stable. Microscopy identified infections in 225 of 505 individuals screened; those with P. falciparum (n = 170) averaged 354 asexual forms/microL and P. vivax/Plasmodium malariae (n = 112) averaged 216 asexual forms/microL of blood. Concordance between OptiMAL and microscopy was 81% and 78% by the two independent readings. The assay's sensitivity for detection of any malaria species was 60.4% and 70.2% respectively and specificity was 97% and 89%. Most cases identified by microscopy as P. falciparum were graded as negative or non-falciparum by both OptiMAL readers. OptiMAL false negatives as well as misidentifications were related to low parasitemias (< 500/microL). The OptiMAL assay demonstrated 88-92% sensitivity for detecting infections of 500-1,000 parasites/microL, a range covering the mean parasitemia of primary symptomatic P. falciparum infections in malaria-naïve Indonesian transmigrants. This device was markedly less sensitive than expert microscopy for discriminating between malaria species and is presently unsuited for use as an epidemiological screening tool. The OptiMAL assay is not approved for diagnostic use but is commercially available for research purposes only."
CD008122,0,19996417,1,Rapid malaria tests: where do we go after 20 years?,"Great advances have been made in developing rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosing malaria. To date, RDTs present an exceedingly practical format for malaria diagnosis that outperforms traditional microscopy and more experimental next generation devices in the development pipeline. However, although use of such tests is accepted in principle, their actual use has lagged. Furthermore, study of how these tests perform, what their limitations are, and how to work with these limitations to still use them effectively has stagnated. We propose that the study and implementation of such RDTs should be aggressively advanced and propose a series of questions that can guide efforts."
CD008122,0,2119482,0,Rapid detection and sequencing of specific in vitro amplified DNA sequences using solid phase methods.,"We describe a rapid solid phase assay for detection and sequencing of DNA sequences based on selective introduction of biotin and isotope into the specific DNA fragment amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A two-step PCR procedure is used to lower the background signal. The in vitro amplified material is immobilized on magnetic beads with covalently coupled streptavidin and the amount of bound label is measured. Samples identified as positive can be analysed by direct solid phase DNA sequencing. A strategy is also described to use general primers for detection, capturing and sequencing, which are not homologous to the specific sequence to be detected. The concept has been optimized using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococci and Streptococci, respectively. Here, we show that the assay can be used for detection of Plasmodium falciparum in clinical samples."
CD008122,0,6397962,0,"Detection of antibodies to malaria: comparison of results with ELISA, IFAT, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis.","194 sera from Vietnamese refugees and 100 pairs of corresponding maternal and cord sera from Liberia were examined for malaria-IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (IFAT). For both tests the antigen was prepared from P. falciparum cultures. 44% of the Vietnamese sera were positive in the ELISA and 36% in the IFAT, but results were discordant in 36% of cases. The Liberian sera were all reactive in the IFAT and 95% were reactive in the ELISA. Overall, there was a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between reciprocal IFAT titer and ELISA extinction value. With both tests, cord serum was generally slightly less reactive than corresponding maternal serum. Results of the two tests on 19 pairs of maternal and cord sera were compared with the number of anti-malaria precipitins detected by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. A positive correlation (p less than 0.01) between ELISA extinction values and numbers of precipitating antibodies was found. It is concluded that ELISA is at least as useful as IFAT for epidemiology and blood donor screening."

CD008122,0,8649267,0,[The utilization of molecular biological tools in the study of malaria transmission: example of programs conducted in Senegal].,"Some informations about malaria transmission, which has until nox difficult to get, can be obtained thanks to the use of molecular biology tools, PCR mainly. In Senegal, we use that technique to solve two kinds of problems: -Identification of species of the Anopheles gambiae complex: PCR technique is useful compared to other diagnostic methods (chromosome pattern, DNA probes, etc.) because it enables quickly and simply identification of captured anopheles from the DNA contained in their legs. The rest of the mosquito is tested by circumsporozoite protein antigen ELISA and blood meal ELISA. The data obtained are used to determine distribution, cycles, trophic preferences and comparative vectorial capacities of Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles melas. -Identification in a mosquito blood meal of the individual bitten: we propose to evaluate factors (weight, age, sex, location of bedroom, etc.) which could explain why individuals are more, or less, bitten by a Plasmodium vector. Genetic typing is used on inhabitants'leukocytes DNA and on the leukocyte DNA extracted from the blood meal of resting anopheles. Through the high degree of polymorphism of three (AAAG)n microsatellites markers, we hope, using PCR, to attribute each blood meal to one individual. Statistical analysis will be used to identify attractivity factors and to determine more precisely the inoculation rates for each group rather than the classical rate calculated with male adults volunteers."
CD008122,0,12680609,0,Assessment of assay sensitivity and precision in a malaria antibody ELISA.,"Many types of ELISA-based immunodiagnostic test kits are commercially available in the market for specific indications. These kits provide necessary assay components, reagents, and guidelines to perform the assay under designated optimal conditions. By using these kits, any unknown or test sample can be assessed as negative or positive based on the results of referral calibrator (Ref+ve and Ref-ve) samples. It is essential to provide reliable test kits to end-users with adequate quality control analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to check the kit for any variations in its performance. While developing a malaria antibody ELISA test-kit, we optimized assay conditions with chequer-board analyses and developed an assay protocol. We have taken out kits randomly from the assembly line and had them evaluated by operators who are new to the test-kits. Assays are performed as per the test guidelines provided. Sera, diluted serially, have shown a clear discriminatory signal between a negative vs. positive sample. A COV is determined by evaluating the Ref-ve calibrator in replicate antigen-coated wells from 6 different plates. This COV is used as a tool to determine S/N ratio of test samples. Besides Ref-ve and Ref+ve calibrators, additional field serum samples are tested with the test kit. Several performance indices, such as mean, standard deviation, %CV are calculated, and the inter- and intra-assay variations determined. The assay precision is determined with large and small replicate samples. In addition, assays are performed concurrently in triplicate-, duplicate-, and single-wells, and the results are analyzed for any assay variations. Different plate areas are identified in antigen-coated 96-well plates and tested blind to detect any variations. The S/N ratio is found to be a very effective tool in determining the assay sensitivity. The %CV was within 10-15%. Variations seen in the assays are found to be due to operator errors and not due to kit reagents. These observations, although, are based upon one type; however, it may as well apply to other line of kits. This is obviously valuable to the end-users of ELISA kits. The operator related error has to be ascertained before lodging any complaint on the kit performance. Based on this data, the test kit has shown acceptable sensitivity and precision and offers compliance on the way the test kits is manufactured. With this, it is concluded that the test kits are suitable for detecting malaria antibody in clinical sample analysis."

CD008122,0,16715782,0,Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics findings after repeated administration of ARTESUNATE thermostable suppositories (RECTOCAPS) in Vietnamese patients with uncomplicated malaria.,"In recent years, Artemisinin and particularly one of its derivatives--Artesunate (ART--has become an essential alternative for treatment of both uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria in Asia and Africa as well. Therefore, these compounds are still and inccreasingly in the focus of interest because of quick acting of this drug, is able to help even unconscious to overcome the malaria attack, when administered by injection. As an alternative, RECTOCAPS have been developed and their use is meanwhile well established. From earlier studies in children, suffering from plasmodium falciparum malaria, we obtained a high level of DHART in the blood, but as expected also a rapid decline in the levels of both DHART and ART. A second administration of ART was additionally applied 4 hours after the first administration. DHART and ART plasma levels were found to last longer on an assumed therapeutic level than those obtained after one administration only. The fever clearance and the parasitemia reduction rates were found to be effective according to this dosing regimen. In view of these findings, we decided to conduct the actual described study by administering 200 mg of ART every 3 hours (0, 3, 6 and 9 h) by the rectal route. Soft geiatine capsules (RECTOCAPS) containing 200 mg of ART GMP--type each (Artesunic acid) were administered by rectal route. Each patient received four RECTOCAPS capsules (4 x 200 mg of ART) over a 3 h period. 12 adult patients with uncomplicated malaria were selected. Age, weight, height, body temperature, parasite counts before treatment and their evolution until 96 h are determined. Blood samples were taken at short time intervals after starting with the first medication: 0, 30 min, 60 min, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 60 h, 72 h, 84 h, 96 h and 108 h. The aliquots of all the blood samples were used for performing parasite counts. Plasma obtained following the traditional procedure was kept at -40 degrees C until analysis. HPLC technique with electrochemical detector was used for quantification of ART and DHART. From the blood concentration values of ART and DHART, the following observation can be derived: the onset of action is observed within the first half hours, therapeutic levels of the drug obtained (89 microg/ml ART compared to 84 microg/ml DHART). The DHART levels are somewhat higher than those of ART (a peak concentration after 6 h starting medication of 151 microg/ml ART as compared to 276 microg/ml DHART). The variations as a function of frequency of DHART uptake are much less marked than those observed for ART. Another finding is that after the administration, some sort of a plateau of DHART and ART is built up, lasting at least from 9 to 12 hours with DHART level of about 190 microg/ml and ART of 90 microg/ml. In the case of single-dose administration, the levels of both compounds were below the detection threshold after three hours. With regard to the parasite counts, although there were inter-individual variations, it should be noted that after 48 hours a high proportion of the patients (8 out of 12) was completely clear of parasites. Similar results were observed with regard to the body temperature (7 out of 12 returned to normal temperature 36 hours after starting the therapy). The findings of the study support the RECTOCAPS application principle resulting in effectiveness both for the velocity of drug uptake as well as for the height of plasma levels. Repeated administration of ART can extend the duration of therapeutic plasma levels of the drug."

The role of laboratory tests is essential to establish the diagnosis of persons who have never resided in the endemic malaria areas and follow up with the patients already under treatment to detect possible complications."

CD008122,0,15781866,0,Enhanced T cell-mediated protection against malaria in human challenges by using the recombinant poxviruses FP9 and modified vaccinia virus Ankara.,"Malaria is a major global health problem for which an effective vaccine is required urgently. Prime-boost vaccination regimes involving plasmid DNA and recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara-encoding liver-stage malaria antigens have been shown to be powerfully immunogenic for T cells and capable of inducing partial protection against experimental malaria challenge in humans, manifested as a delay in time to patent parasitemia. Here, we report that substitution of plasmid DNA as the priming vector with a specific attenuated recombinant fowlpox virus, FP9, vaccine in such prime-boost regimes can elicit complete sterile protection that can last for 20 months. Protection at 20 months was associated with persisting memory but not effector T cell responses. The protective efficacy of various immunization regimes correlated with the magnitude of induced immune responses, supporting the strategy of maximizing durable T cell immunogenicity to develop more effective liver-stage vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum malaria."

CD008122,0,1897303,0,Human response to a malaria vaccine candidate antigen.,"The Plasmodium falciparum heat-shock protein 70 (PFHSP70) has been proposed as a potential candidate antigen for a malaria vaccine. In this study the human immune response to this antigen has been evaluated. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed on serum samples collected from individuals during and after malarial infection. Only 70% of falciparum malaria patients responded to this antigen during the natural course of infection and 54% of the recovered cases who had no parasitaemia at the time of blood collection lacked detectable antibody. The non-responders to PFHSP70 exhibited an antibody response to total schizont antigens. There was no correlation between the response against total schizont antigens and PFHSP70 antigen. The non-responsiveness against PFHSP70 was not related to age, sex or regional variations. These qualities are undesirable for a vaccine candidate antigen."
CD008122,0,15979769,0,Financial requirements of immunisation programmes in developing countries: a 2004-2014 perspective.,"Vaccines are a key contributor to public health, especially in developing countries. Despite numerous demonstrations of the cost-effectiveness of immunisation, vaccines spending accounted for only 1.7% of the total pharmaceutical market in 2002, when UNICEF estimated that 34 million children were not reached by routine immunisation, most of them in developing countries. Several international organizations or initiatives, like the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), have defined a long-term goal of universal immunisation in developing countries. There is an urgent need to estimate the financial resources required to meet this goal. The objective of this study was to anticipate the funding needs for childhood immunisation in developing countries over the 2004-2014 period. The study scope includes all the 75 countries eligible for support from GAVI, and covers existing vaccines that are considered as a priority for GAVI (DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (as a stand alone presentation or in combination with DTP) and yellow fever) as well as future vaccines (meningitis A and C, rotavirus, human papilloma virus (HPV), malaria, Streptococcus pneumoniae and tuberculosis) likely to be available within the 10-year period. We developed a methodology to estimate the number of doses required, based on disease prevalence and incidence, target populations, introduction dates of new vaccines, coverage dynamics and dosing regimen. The introduction price and price evolution of vaccines over time were modelled, taking into account the type of vaccine, the expected return on investment from vaccine manufacturers and the competitive landscape. Non-vaccine costs (capital costs and non-vaccine recurrent costs) were estimated based on the number of people immunised and number of doses dispensed, using available case studies as a reference. According to the optimal scenario that would consider the provision of all vaccines to all relevant developing countries as soon as they are available, funding requirements to cover the associated total costs over the 10-year period were estimated to be about US$ 30 billion. Vaccines-related costs represent the largest share, with estimated costs of US$ 21 billion (among which 18 billion for new vaccines), the remaining needs being split between capital costs and other recurrent costs. Accounting for the main imponderables (such as delay in vaccines launch compared to industry plans) as well as probable phasing of vaccine introduction in countries, the total costs of immunisation would be reduced to US$ 14-17 billion over the same period. Vaccines-related costs represent the largest share (US$ 7.1-9.3 billion, among which 4.3-6.5 billion for new vaccines). This study advocates for the anticipation of the substantial financial resources needed to (a) purchase and introduce these vaccines in the developing countries in order to reduce the time lag between availability in industrialised and developing countries; and (b) stimulate vaccine researchers and manufacturers to continue research and development of much needed vaccines for the developing world."

There was no evidence for the existence of any polymorph other than the two already described. Based on the ELISAs, the overall prevalence of the VK 247 type was 29.5%, including those found mixed with VK 210. Relative proportions of VK 210 and VK 247 differed between collection sites. At all places, the ratio of VK 210 to VK 247 was significantly higher at the end of the nontransmission season than it was later during the annual monsoon, suggesting that there may be intrinsic biological differences between the polymorphs that affect their survival."

A monoclonal antibody that passively protects monkeys against sporozoite challenge recognizes a four-amino acid linear sequence AGDR included within this nonamer, but when monkeys were immunized with a vaccine, NS1(81)V20, which contains 20 copies of the nonamer, they failed to produce antibodies to AGDR. To determine if natural exposure to sporozoites induces antibodies to AGDR, we tested sera from 176 individuals from a malaria-endemic area in Flores, Indonesia. Seventy-one percent of the adults had antibodies to the P. vivax repeat region; only 18% had detectable antibodies to AGDR. None of the subjects had antibodies to the P. vivax variant repeat ANGAGNQPG. We next tested sera from six human volunteers immunized with NS1(81)V20 and found that the vaccine, despite inducing antibodies against the nonamer, as it did in the monkeys, did not induce antibodies against AGDR. To further test our ability to raise anti-AGDR antibodies using synthetic peptides, we immunized Aotus monkeys and BALB/c mice with AGDR. Sera from the mice reacted strongly with both AGDR and a recombinant protein containing the 20 copies of the nonamer. Sera from the monkeys reacted only minimally with a protein (VIVAX-1) that contains monomeric AGDR within its sequence. Sera from the mice also bound air-dried P. vivax sporozoites, while sera from the monkeys did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008122,0,18389082,0,Hepatocyte permissiveness to Plasmodium infection is conveyed by a short and structurally conserved region of the CD81 large extracellular domain.,"Invasion of hepatocytes by Plasmodium sporozoites is a prerequisite for establishment of a malaria infection, and thus represents an attractive target for anti-malarial interventions. Still, the molecular mechanisms underlying sporozoite invasion are largely unknown. We have previously reported that the tetraspanin CD81, a known receptor for the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is required on hepatocytes for infection by sporozoites of several Plasmodium species. Here we have characterized CD81 molecular determinants required for infection of hepatocytic cells by P. yoelii sporozoites. Using CD9/CD81 chimeras, we have identified in CD81 a 21 amino acid stretch located in a domain structurally conserved in the large extracellular loop of tetraspanins, which is sufficient in an otherwise CD9 background to confer susceptibility to P. yoelii infection. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated the key role of a solvent-exposed region around residue D137 within this domain. A mAb that requires this region for optimal binding did not block infection, in contrast to other CD81 mAbs. This study has uncovered a new functionally important region of CD81, independent of HCV E2 envelope protein binding domain, and further suggests that CD81 may not interact directly with a parasite ligand during Plasmodium infection, but instead may regulate the function of a yet unknown partner protein."
CD008122,0,19346368,0,Unified parasite lactate dehydrogenase and histidine-rich protein ELISA for quantification of Plasmodium falciparum.,"There is a need for more objective and quantitative tools to replace microscopy in malaria diagnosis. Emphasis has recently been placed on alternative methods such as immunochromatography-based rapid tests. However, these tests provide only qualitative results. Two bio-molecules, parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and histidine-rich proteins (HRPs), that are released by the intra-erythrocytic stages of the parasite offer certain specific characteristics that could potentially improve malaria diagnosis. In this paper, we describe a protocol for a unified sandwich ELISA that allows for the separate but concurrent measurement of pLDH and HRP biomolecules in aliquots taken from the same samples. Freshly drawn blood from a healthy unexposed adult male was used to serially dilute in vitro cultivated and synchronized ring stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Commercially available ELISA formats were modified to allow for the measurement of pLDH and HRP from aliquots of the same samples. The pLDH and HRP levels in the samples spiked with known numbers of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) were measured, and the values were used to generate standard graphs. The standard graphs were used to estimate the numbers of iRBCs in test samples. Serially diluted recombinant proteins were similarly used to generate a calibration curve, allowing for the expression of test results in nanograms of their respective recombinant protein. Levels of pLDH and HRPs were determined by using 1) P. falciparum culture material (cells and medium) 2) P. falciparum infected human blood (N = 6) samples, and 3) plasma from P. falciparum-infected patient (N = 22) samples. The parasite density of all culture and infected patient samples was also estimated by microscopy. Both pLDH and HRP levels correlated positively with the parasite density assessed by microscopy: Pearson correlation coefficient pLDH (r = 0.754, P < 0.0001, 95% CI: 0.47-0.89); HRP (r = 0.552, P < 0.007, 95% CI: 0.16-0.79). The HRPs seem to be released in larger quantities than pLDH (in a ratio of ~1 pLDH:~6 HRP), making the detection of HRP in culture material, blood, and plasma easier. The modified ELISA assay with quantitative measurement of pLDH and HRPs may provide a valuable tool for malaria research and patient management."
CD008122,0,1723723,0,Detection of different developmental stages of malaria parasites by non-radioactive DNA in situ hybridization.,"A highly sensitive non-radioactive DNA in situ hybridization procedure is described that enables detection and unequivocal identification of various developmental stages of human and rodent malaria parasites. Using biotinylated species-specific DNA probes, erythrocytic parasites can be specifically stained in blood smears. Similarly exoerythrocytic stages can be visualized in cell culture and in sections of paraffin-embedded liver. In blood smears, the hybridization procedure provides a rapid detection of (low) parasitemia and species-determination for experienced microscopists at 100 to 400x magnification. Moreover, the procedure can be applied even after previous Giemsa staining of the preparation, enabling revision of patient smears which were difficult to read after routine Giemsa staining."
CD008122,0,12139227,1,Short report: Field evaluation of posttreatment sensitivity for monitoring parasite clearance of Plasmodium falciparum malaria by use of the Determine Malaria pf test in central India.,"The posttreatment performance of the Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein rapid diagnostic test Determine Malaria pf (Abbott Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) was assessed in 70 patients in central India with uncomplicated falciparum malaria who were treated with chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and arteether. Data were compared with those of microscopy. Results revealed that the sensitivity for predicting recrudescence by means of the Determine test after treatment with chloroquine on Day 14 was 75%, with 50% specificity. However, antigenemia was detected in 16% of patients as late as Day 21 in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-treated subjects with a drug-sensitive response. Clearance of parasitemia in thick blood smear and clearance of antigenemia appeared to parallel each other only in arteether-treated subjects. The observed diagnostic trends therefore mean that the potential of the Determine test to detect recrudescent infection is limited."
CD008122,0,14516298,1,Rapid diagnostic testing for malaria.,"Malaria rapid diagnostic devices (MRDD) have been developed with the hope that they would offer accurate, reliable, rapid, cheap and easily available alternatives to traditional methods of malaria diagnosis. The results from early malaria rapid diagnostic studies were quite promising, especially for detecting Plasmodium falciparum at densities of more than 100-500 parasites/microl. Despite the introduction of these devices over a decade ago, only a few target antigens have been introduced. Of greater concern, these devices have shown limitations in sensitivity, ability to differentiate species and robustness under field conditions in the tropics. Recent trials have revealed wide variability in sensitivity both within and between products. We review the recent trials assessing MRDD use for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and non-P. falciparum infections in endemic and non-endemic countries and describe the various aspects of these devices which need further improvement. High quality, accurate, rapid and affordable diagnostic tools are urgently needed now that new antimalarial regimens, characterized by higher cost and increased toxicity, have been introduced more widely in response to emerging multi-drug resistance."

Results were compared with conventional Giemsa-stained blood films. Of 306 people tested 37.9% (116/306) were found to be parasitaemic; of these 66.4% (77/116) were P. vivax and 32.8% (38/116) were P. falciparum infections. There was only one (0.9%) mixed P. falciparum plus P. vivax infection. The RTM test was positive in 35/36 patients with P. falciparum identified on blood smear examination, resulting in a sensitivity of 97.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 91.6-102.8%]. Specificity was 96.3% (95% CI: 93.9-98.6%). The RTM test had a positive predictive value of 77.8% (95% CI: 65.7-89.9%) and a negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI: 98.4-100.8%). Of the 10 false positives, seven reported recent malaria episode and treatment, indicating persistence of antigenaemia. If these were assumed truly infected, the positive predictive value is increased to 93.3% (95% CI: 85.8-100.8%). The RTM test was positive in all seven P. falciparum infections with gametocytes and one mixed infection, but was negative in all falciparum gametocytes and relapsing fever cases. All but one P. vivax infection gave negative result on the RTM test. The RTM test missed one patient with parasitaemia. The test is highly sensitive and specific requiring no instrument or trained personnel. It appears to be a very useful tool for rapid diagnosis of malaria, especially in the rural health institutions with limited diagnostic facilities."

Of 57 children treated with i.m. quinine, 4 died, 3 had neurological sequelae and 2 had sterile intramuscular abscesses. Of 47 children treated with i.v. quinine, 6 died and 1 had neurological sequelae. The mean parasite clearance time was 58.6 h in the i.m. group and 59.3 h in the i.v. group. Mean temperature clearance times were 56.1 and 51.8 h, and mean coma clearance times 40.4 and 38.7 h, respectively. None of these differences was statistically significant. Mean trough and peak concentrations of quinine were almost identical in the 2 groups, ranging from 10.5 to 12.6 mg/L, which is in the therapeutic non-toxic range. It is concluded that i.m. quinine is as effective as quinine by i.v. infusion in children with severe and complicated malaria; that minor local side effects can probably be avoided by using diluted quinine for i.m. injection; and that the optimal dose regimen for children with severe and complicated malaria in Africa at present is probably quinine salt 20 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 h."

Optimal use of a vaccine in Africa will only be achieved if it can be delivered through the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI). We have completed a trial of the peptide vaccine SPf66 in Tanzanian infants, given alongside the EPI vaccines. This paper describes the humoral responses to SPf66 and the EPI vaccines. A total of 1207 infants were recruited into a two-arm, double-blind, individually randomized placebo-controlled trial of SPf66. The objectives of the trial were to determine the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of SPf66 and to assess interactions with EPI vaccines when three doses of SPf66 were delivered alongside the EPI vaccines. Cross-sectional surveys were carried out to asses seroconversion rates to the EPI vaccines and the antibody response to SPf66 (NANP)50 and Plasmodium falciparum lysates. Seroconversion rates to EPI vaccines were high and no statistically significant differences in prevalence or titres were found between SPf66 and placebo recipients. IgG antibodies against SPf66 (NANP)50 and whole P. falciparum lysate were present in high titres in mothers of recruited children at the time of birth. Vaccination with SPf66 stimulated a good anti-SPf66 IgG response which declined to preimmunization levels by 2 years of age and which was not associated with protection against clinical malaria. The vaccine induced no IgG antibodies against (NANP)50 or P. falciparum lysates. SPf66 stimulated a humoral immune response when given to very young infants and did not interfere with seroconversion to EPI vaccines. The response to SPf66 was qualitatively different from that seen in older children, in whom SPf66 has been shown to be moderately efficacious. This difference raises concerns about the difficulties of immunizing very young infants who need to be targeted by antimalarial vaccination programs."

A Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2)-based assay (ICT) and a Plasmodium-specific lactate dehydrogenase test (OptiMAL) were evaluated for their specificities in different groups of patients who tested negative for malaria infection by microscopy. The patients were selected from different disease groups: rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C, toxoplasmosis, schistosomiasis, and hydatid disease. One hundred thirty-three of the 225 patients were positive for rheumatoid factor. Thirty-five of the 133 (26%) rheumatoid factor-positive patients gave a false-positive reaction with the ICT assay, but only 4 of these gave false-positive reactions with the OptiMAL test. Thirty-three of the 35 false-positive specimens became negative when repeat tested with the ICT assay after absorbing out the rheumatoid factor activity.

CD008122,0,17329382,0,"Ethical challenges in voluntary blood donation in Kerala, India.","The National Blood Policy in India relies heavily on voluntary blood donors, as they are usually assumed to be associated with low levels of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). In India, it is mandatory to test every unit of blood collected for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, syphilis and malaria. Donors come to the blood bank with altruistic intentions. If donors test positive to any of the five infections, their blood is discarded. Although the blood policy advocates disclosure of TTI status, donors are not, in practice, informed about their results. The onus is on the donor to contact the blood bank. Out of approximately 16 000 donations in the past 2 years, 438 tested positive for TTI, including 107 for HIV. Only 20% of the donors contacted the blood bank; none of them were HIV positive. Disclosure by blood banks of TTI status by telephone or mail has resulted in serious consequences for some donors. Health providers face an ethical dilemma, in the absence of proper mechanisms in place for disclosure of test results, regarding notification to donors who may test positive but remain ignorant of their TTI status. Given the high cost of neglecting to notify infected donors, the authors strongly recommend the use of rapid tests before collecting blood, instead of the current practice, which takes 3 h to obtain results, and disclosure of results directly to the donor by a counsellor, to avoid dropouts and to ensure confidentiality."

CD008122,0,17387158,0,Improved assessment of plasmodium vivax response to antimalarial drugs by a colorimetric double-site plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"The occurrence of Plasmodium vivax resistance to chloroquine has been reported in several countries of Asia and South America. However, the resistance of P. vivax is insufficiently documented for three reasons: it has received far less attention than P. falciparum; in vivo investigations are handicapped by the existence of hypnozoites, which make it difficult to distinguish between recrudescences due to drug failure and relapses due to dormant forms in the liver; and in vitro studies are greatly limited by the poor growth of P. vivax. We report on the adaptation to P. vivax of a colorimetric double-site Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay previously developed for P. falciparum. The assay proved remarkably sensitive, as under optimal conditions it could detect P. vivax parasitemia levels as low as 10(-8). The technique, which relies on the detection of protein synthesis by the parasite, yielded steep drug-response curves, leading to the precise determination of the 50% inhibitory concentrations for a high proportion of isolates. Chloroquine-resistant parasites were identified in an area where this phenomenon had been documented by in vivo methods. Thus, the results indicate that the in vitro susceptibility of P. vivax can now be monitored easily and efficiently. The data suggest that the threshold of resistance is similar to that of P. falciparum, i.e., in the range of 100 nM for chloroquine and 15 nM for pyronaridine. However, further studies are required to precisely define the cutoff for resistance and the sensitivity to each drug."

A system incorporating heparin, EDTA, and acridine orange into a microhematocrit tube (Quantitative Blood Count, QBC) has been commercially developed for the quantitation of blood counts and has been used for the diagnosis of malaria. We evaluated this test for its usefulness in the diagnosis of filariasis. Upon centrifugation, the parasites were concentrated in the area of the buffy coat and could be observed through the wall of the tube. The parasites were concentrated further by a plastic float that expands the buffy coat and confines the parasites to the periphery of the tube. Acridine orange stains the DNA of the parasite, and morphologic characteristics can be examined by fluorescence microscopy. The terminal and subterminal nuclei and long cephalic space of Brugia malayi, as well as the short cephalic space and caudal nuclei of Wuchereria bancrofti, were easily recognized and differentiated from each other. Microfilariae were detected in samples diluted to a level of approximately 50/ml."
CD008122,0,18196953,0,Growth and host-pathogen interactions.,"Differing trajectories of infant and child growth are associated with different patterns of disease and mortality in adulthood. Since postnatal growth patterns are partially modifiable by diet, these associations raise fresh questions about what constitutes an optimal growth rate. We use data from contemporary societies that still suffer poor nutrition and high burdens of infectious disease to illustrate early growth patterns that have likely been typical of our evolutionary past. Pathogenic assault is a major suppressor of growth; populations frequently average -1.0 to -1.5 z scores (standard deviations relative to standard growth curves) for height, and -2.0 to -2.5 z scores for weight, body mass index and head circumference. Many infections are symptomatic (e.g. diarrhea, malaria, pneumonia, HIV), but others are subclinical (e.g. hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes, Helicobacter pylori). The great majority of young children become infected by multiple pathogens which initiate a downward cycle of infection --> suppressed appetite and malabsorption --> reduced growth --> lowered immunity --> repeated infection. Examination of the evolutionary 'norm' for early growth, and the external environmental factors that influenced it, may provide clues towards identifying the current day optimum for growth."
CD008122,0,10701207,0,[Diagnostic test to identify human Plasmodium species by the quantitative buffy coat test].,"The quantitative buffy coat system (QBC Test) was designed for rapid diagnosis of malaria by identifying the presence of hemoparasites. The main drawback of the technique is failure to identify the Plasmodium species. The purpose of this study was to attempt to remedy this problem by studying the distribution of the parasites at the bottom of the test tube. Indeed since the QBC Test is based on gradient centrifugation of blood components, the distribution of the parasites in the test tube depends on density. Blind QBC Tests were performed on specimens obtained from two different batches, i.e., one from France and the other from Burkina Faso. Distribution curves were obtained by counting the number of parasites in all microscopic fields in the five-millimeter test tube. Our findings showed differences in distribution curve depending on species. For Plasmodium falciparum, the number of parasites was nearly the same in all fields suggesting that the arrangement of the parasites in the QBC Test tube was linear. For Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, the number of parasites was markedly lower near the cap of the tube suggesting that a non-linear arrangement with a decreasing number of parasites toward the top of the tube. In 97 p. 100 of cases, we were able to propose a differential diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum versus Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale. However it was not possible to distinguish between Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. In case of mixed infection it would be difficult to distinguish Plasmodium falciparum from the other species. The ability to identify Plasmodium species would add to the advantages of the rapid and sensitive QBC Test."
CD008122,0,2863543,0,ELISA HTLV retrovirus antibody reactivity associated with malaria and immune complexes in healthy Africans.,"A serological survey of 250 outpatients in rural Zaire showed that the prevalence of antibody against HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and HTLV-III, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, correlated strongly with level of antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum. The age curve for the prevalence of antibody against these retroviruses and high titres of antibodies against P falciparum were similar. Tests with control sera obtained from HTLV-III seropositive homosexual men and American subjects repeatedly infected with malaria who had high antibody titres against P falciparum indicated that there was no cross-reactivity between P falciparum and these retroviruses. Immune-complex levels, but not IgG, IgM, or IgE levels, also correlated strongly with seropositivity in the ELISA HTLV-I and HTLV-III assay, although immune-complex-positive control samples were negative. Possible explanations include coincidental distribution paralleling malaria; similar mode of transmission; virus activation and/or enhanced antibody production due to the effect of malaria on the immune system; and false-positive reactivity in the ELISA assay due to cross-reactive antibodies or other unknown factors."

CD008122,0,15845504,0,Induction of strain-transcending immunity against Plasmodium chabaudi adami malaria with a multiepitope DNA vaccine.,"A major goal of current malaria vaccine programs is to develop multivalent vaccines that will protect humans against the many heterologous malaria strains that circulate in endemic areas. We describe a multiepitope DNA vaccine, derived from a genomic Plasmodium chabaudi adami DS DNA expression library of 30,000 plasmids, which induces strain-transcending immunity in mice against challenge with P. c. adami DK. Segregation of this library and DNA sequence analysis identified vaccine subpools encoding open reading frames (ORFs)/peptides of >9 amino acids [aa] (the V9+ pool, 303 plasmids) and >50 aa (V50+ pool, 56 plasmids), respectively. The V9+ and V50+ plasmid vaccine subpools significantly cross-protected mice against heterologous P. c. adami DK challenge, and protection correlated with the induction of both specific gamma interferon production by splenic cells and opsonizing antibodies. Bioinformatic analysis showed that 22 of the V50+ ORFs were polypeptides conserved among three or more Plasmodium spp., 13 of which are predicted hypothetical proteins. Twenty-nine of these ORFs are orthologues of predicted Plasmodium falciparum sequences known to be expressed in the blood stage, suggesting that this vaccine pool encodes multiple blood-stage antigens. The results have implications for malaria vaccine design by providing proof-of-principle that significant strain-transcending immunity can be induced using multiepitope blood-stage DNA vaccines and suggest that both cellular responses and opsonizing antibodies are necessary for optimal protection against P. c. adami."
CD008122,0,11369272,0,Antibodies specific for heat shock proteins in human and murine malaria.,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are immunodominant antigens recognized by the host immune system in various infectious diseases. We analyzed HSP-specific antibodies, including immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA, in sera from malaria patients in Thailand by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All of the antibodies to HSP90 were remarkably increased in the patients compared with those in controls, while only IgM to HSP70 or IgA to HSP65 was significantly elevated. Further experiments showed that anti-HSP IgG was significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice infected with a non-lethal strain of Plasmodium yoelii, with anti-HSP90 IgG being the most elevated. These results suggest that the antigenic potential of HSP90 is higher than those of HSP70 and HSP65 in malaria infection."
CD008122,0,9649195,0,Increased eosinophil activity in acute Plasmodium falciparum infection--association with cerebral malaria.,"To assess the eosinophil response to Plasmodium falciparum infection a cohort of initially parasite-free Ghanaian children was followed for 3 months. Seven of nine children who acquired an asymptomatic P. falciparum infection showed increase in eosinophil counts, while a decrease was found in seven of nine children with symptomatic malaria, and no change was observed in 14 children who remained parasite-free. In a hospital-based study, paediatric patients with cerebral malaria (CM), severe anaemia (SA), or uncomplicated malaria (UM) had uniformly low eosinophil counts during the acute illness followed by eosinophilia 30 days after cure. Plasma levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil protein X (EPX) were measured as indicators of eosinophil activation. In spite of the low eosinophil counts, ECP levels were increased on day 0 and significantly higher in patients with CM (geometric mean (95% confidence interval) 8.5 ng/ml (6.8-10.7 ng/ml)) than in SA (4.7 ng/ml (3.0-7.5 ng/ml)) and UM patients (4.3 ng/ml (3.6-5.3 ng/ml), P < 0.001). A similar pattern was found for EPX. It thus appears that the low eosinophil counts may be due to tissue sequestration and destruction rather than decreased production. The plasma levels of the granule proteins correlated with levels of tumour necrosis factor and soluble IL-2 receptor, implicating inflammatory responses and T cell activation as causes of the eosinophil activation. By contrast, the eosinophil induction did not appear to be part of a Th2-like response. Eosinophil granule proteins may be important in both control of malaria infection and the pathogenesis of severe malaria."
CD008122,0,16410895,0,Acute respiratory distress syndrome due to vivax malaria: case report and literature review.,"Severe pulmonary involvement in malaria has been frequently reported in cases of Plasmodium falciparum infection, but rarely in vivax malaria. Among the 11 previous cases of vivax-related severe respiratory involvement described in the literature, all except one developed it after the beginning of anti-malarial treatment; these appear to correspond to an exacerbation of the inflammatory response. We report the case of a 43-year-old Brazilian woman living in a malaria-endemic area, who presented acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by P. vivax before starting anti-malarial treatment. The diagnosis was made based on microscopic methods. A negative rapid immunochromatographic assay, based on the detection of Histidine Rich Protein-2 (HRP-2) of P. falciparum, indicated that falciparum malaria was unlikely. After specific anti-plasmodial therapy and intensive supportive care, the patient was discharged from the hospital. We conclude that vivax malaria-associated ARDS can develop before anti-malarial therapy."
CD008122,0,19499726,0,[Update on the epidemiology of malaria in French Guiana].,"The last study describing the epidemiology of malaria in French Guiana was published 20 years ago. Yet French Guiana in the Americas along with Mayotte in the Indian Ocean is the only French territory with persisting endemic malaria. The purpose of this study is to provide an update based on official malaria surveillance data as well as on information from hospital records and various field surveys that have been carried out in recent years. Due to recurrent problems in collecting thorough, continuous, and consistent data, exact determination of incidence by plasmodium species has always been difficult in French Guiana. These problems include not only the remote location of endemic areas and intense unpredictable migration patterns but also poor data collection methods that do not always ensure consistency and homogeneity. Another factor hindering thorough collection of conventional epidemiological data is the requirement for rapid effective treatment in remote regions. The overall incidence of malaria in French Guiana appears to have remained stable since the beginning of the decade with an average of 3,920 case reports per year for an incidence rate of 20 per thousand, noting that three fourths of the 206,000 inhabitants of French Guiana live outside of endemic areas. Overall involvement of P. falciparum and P. vivax appears to be equal with P. malariae accounting for only 2.6% of cases. Trends in recent years indicate an increase in the number of cases involving P. vivax especially in the eastern zones, i.e. in the Oyapock focus where annual incidences in children have reached up to 500 per thousand and in the whole region located between Saint Georges and Cayenne. Conversely a decrease in endemic levels has been observed in western areas, especially for P. falciparum in the upper and middle focuses of the Maroni. Most zones now causing problems are located near migration points, particularly in relation with clandestine gold panning activities. In the coastal strip where the three main cities with most of the population are located, most reported cases are imported but local cases may occur. In general local transmission in these areas has been promptly controlled but trends indicate that incidence of these events may be rising. Anopheles darlingi is still recognized as the main vector but its role in transmission is less obvious in eastern areas where increasing evidence suggests that other species may contribute to maintaining endemic levels. These findings indicate that the extensive resources deployed in this French territory (public financing, health care network, public awareness campaigns, and training of health care personnel in diagnosis and treatment of malaria) have helped reduce the number of severe cases in an unfavorable epidemiological setting."
CD008122,0,11904099,0,A sero-epidemiological study of malaria in human and monkey populations in French Guiana.,"This paper describes a sero-epidemiological study of malaria prevalence in French Guiana. An immunofluorescence assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect antibodies against blood-stage antigens and synthetic peptides mimicking the repetitive epitope of the sporozoites of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae/brasilianum, in 218 human sera and 113 non-human primate sera collected in French Guiana. Almost all the monkey sera tested had antibodies against malaria blood-stages (98%) and a large majority (73%) also tested positive with the P. malariae/brasilianum circumsporozoite peptide. A number of primate samples also reacted positively with P. falciparum NANP repeats in a very specific manner, suggesting that monkeys in the rainforest are bitten by mosquitoes infected with human malaria parasites. Seroprevalences were lower in the humans tested but Indian tribes on the borders with Suriname and Brazil were clearly more exposed to malaria than other ethnic groups, with a prevalence of nearly 70% seropositivity. P. vivax infections accounted for much of the observed pattern of reactivity, but there was also a high frequency of positive reactions to the P. brasilianum/malariae peptide. Similarly, a large proportion of the sera obtained from Bush Negro populations tested positive for P. malariae/brasilianum repeats. These data add to the emerging evidence that non-human primates might constitute a natural reservoir, not only for simian, but also for human malaria, and therefore suggest that they might be responsible for the maintenance of foci of P. malariae, and possibly of other malaria species, in isolated areas of the Amazonian rainforest."
CD008122,0,11441695,0,[Malaria--rapid diagnostic tests and emergency self-medication].,"WHO recommendations have adopted the option of stand-by emergency treatment (SBT) for travellers to areas where malaria is endemic and medical attention may not be obtained within 24 hours after onset of symptoms. Indication and choice of drugs for SBT depend on use and kind of a chemoprophylactic regimen, situation of plasmodial resistance at the destination, and contraindications and tolerability in the individual traveller. However, the diagnosis of malaria on clinical grounds alone is unreliable, and fever occurs frequently during travel to malaria endemic areas from various reasons. The possibility of malaria has to be considered in all cases of unexplained fever that starts after the 7th day of stay in an endemic area. Studies in European travellers have shown that only 0.5-1.4% of all travellers to whom SBT medication has been prescribed, will finally use it. SBT use in febrile travellers (8.1-10.4% of all travellers) has been 4.9-17%, but plasmodial infection could be confirmed retrospectively in 10.8-16.7% of SBT-users only. The recent introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for malaria has provided a potential tool to self-diagnose and treat a possible malaria attack when medical attention or microscopic diagnosis is not available. However, the utilisation of currently available RTDs by travellers has been shown to be technically problematic. Healthy volunteers were able to learn how to perform the tests, especially when standard written instructions were supplemented with verbal information (75 vs. 90% successful performance). But their interpretation of test results was unsatisfactory, with a high rate of false-negatives (14.1%). In another study in febrile European tourists in Kenya, only 68% of patients were able to perform the RDTs correctly, and 10 out of 11 with microscopically confirmed malaria failed to diagnose themselves accurately. Thus, besides appropriate training before departure, technical improvements are required before such RDT kits can be recommended for self-use by travellers."

CD008122,0,2459062,0,Naturally occurring antibodies to an epitope on Plasmodium falciparum gametes detected by monoclonal antibody-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"The antibody response to an epitope on gamete antigens of Plasmodium falciparum in persons naturally exposed to malaria has been investigated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The assay detects antibodies to an epitope on the 48/45-kilodalton (kDa) gamete surface antigen by competition with horseradish peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody IIC5-B10. Five sera previously shown to immunoprecipitate the 230- and 48/45-kDa antigens significantly inhibited IIC5-B10 binding to an average of 24.2% of control. The one serum which precipitated only the 48/45-kDa antigen did not inhibit IIC5-B10 binding. For 26 sera which were negative by immunoprecipitation, mean binding in the assay was 112.7% of control (pooled London nonimmune sera). Recognition of both 230-kDa and 48/45-kDa antigens was associated with a titer of 1:9 or greater (reciprocal geometric mean titer, 27.6) for inhibition to more than 2 standard deviations from the mean of the negative sera. The results show that the IIC5-B10 binding site is a naturally immunogenic epitope recognized by the majority of persons who had antibodies to the 48/45-kDa protein. An additional finding was enhancement of binding of IIC5-B10 to an average of 154.4% of control by five sera which recognized only the 230-kDa antigen, presumably due to conformational alteration of the gamete antigen complex."

CD008122,0,16714553,0,Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes increase intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression on brain endothelium through NF-kappaB.,"Sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (Pf-IRBC) in postcapillary brain endothelium is a hallmark of cerebral malaria (CM) pathogenesis. There is a correlation between adherent Pf-IRBC and increased expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which is also a receptor for Pf-IRBC on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). The underlying mechanism for the increased ICAM-1 expression has not been clearly defined. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of ICAM-1 expression on isolated HBMEC after exposure to Pf-IRBC. Ultrastructural characterization of the model confirmed that there was attachment through both Pf-IRBC knobs and HBMEC microvillus protrusions. Pf-IRBC induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in ICAM-1 expression on HBMEC that was specific for human brain endothelium and was not observed with human umbilical vein endothelium. Involvement of both membrane-associated Pf-IRBC proteins and parasite-derived soluble factors with the increase in ICAM-1 expression was demonstrated by surface trypsinization and fractionation. Pf-IRBC exposure induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in HBMEC, which was linked to ICAM-1 expression, as shown by use of specific inhibitors of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and immunocytochemistry. In addition, inhibition of reactive oxygen species decreased Pf-IRBC-induced ICAM-1 expression on HBMEC. Parasite-induced ICAM-1 expression explains the localization of this molecule on brain endothelium in postmortem CM brain samples. By increasing ICAM-1 expression, Pf-IRBC may increase their sequestration, thereby perpetuating CM."
CD008122,0,12355376,0,Dichotomous effects of Plasmodium falciparum antigens on expression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coreceptors and on infectability of CD4 cells by HIV.,"Many microbial coinfections accelerate the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Coinfections of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and HIV-1 are common; however, past studies of the effects of P. falciparum malaria on HIV-1 infection have shown little effect. The present study found that P. falciparum antigens (PF-Ags) variably regulate the expression of HIV-1 coreceptors and modulate the infectability of CD4 cells by HIV-1. Shortly after PF-Ag stimulation, CCR5 expression was down-regulated, but CXCR4 expression was modestly up-regulated. Subsequently, CCR5 expression on CD4 cells was induced. Infectability of PF-Ag-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by R5 HIV-1 was decreased, regardless of the duration of PF-Ag stimulation or CCR5 expression levels. In contrast, X4 HIV-1 replication was enhanced briefly in PBMC stimulated with PF-Ags but was inhibited with longer stimulation. Decreased HIV-1 infectability resulted, in part, from endogenous production of interferon-gamma. These results may explain why malaria previously did not appear to accelerate HIV-1 disease progression."
CD008122,0,11980406,0,[Evaluation of in vitro drug sensitivity of antimalarials for Plasmodium falciparum using a colorimetric assay (DELI-microtest)].,"The DELI-microtest (Double-Site Enzyme Linked LDH Immunodetection) is a colorimetric method for determination of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro sensitivity to antimalarial drugs. This method is based on the capture of the specific lactate deshydrogenase of Plasmodium falciparum (pLDH) using 2 monoclonal antibodies which recognize 2 different sites of the enzyme. The second monoclonal antibody is biotinylated and may catch a peroxidase-labelled streptavidine and develop a colorimetric reaction in the presence of peroxidase substrate. The level of pLDH released by parasite growth is determined by the measure of optical densities. An excellent correlation has been observed between the IC50's obtained using the DELI-microtest and the classical isotopic microtest, and the high sensitivity of the DELI-microtest can be used to measure the IC50's for isolates with parasitemia as low as 0.005%. It is easier and faster to process than isotopic microtest in field conditions. In addition, due to high sensitivity of the DELI-microtest, isolates with a low parasitemia may be included in the studies."

Finger prick blood from each individual was collected on d 1. After treatment with chloroquine, a further blood sample was collected from each child on d 7, 30, 90 and 180 for assay of antibody responses to P. falciparum antigens. Isolates from individual patients were incubated in vitro for demonstration of rosette formation, assay of plasmodial growth rate and analysis of Pfcrt gene polymorphism. Out of 27 isolates of P. falciparum, 20 showed formation of rosettes in vitro. The growth rate at 96 h varied widely among the isolates. In Pfcrt gene analysis at 76-codon site, 14 showed wild-type Lys 76, 7 showed mutant type Thr 76 and 6 had mixed type. 14 children, all with anaemia on d 7, showed a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT). Sera positive by ELISA IgG on d 90 also showed parasite growth inhibitory activity in vitro. Significant levels of IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 subclass antibodies against MSP1 were detected in 14 sera collected on d 90. On d 180, there was a decline in IgG and its subtypes. These findings suggest that a variability in isolates may occur in one and the same seasonal area, making children prone to infection. As a consequence, they develop antibodies during recovery phase from an acute attack, which remain in circulation for a period of 4-5 months. After that, a decline in antibody level may again make them susceptible to the disease. Prevalence of different serotypes in a small area may suggest the complexity of malaria transmission."

In the direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA), a comparison is made between the infectivity of gametocytes from a naturally infected gametocyte carrier in the presence of autologous plasma and the infectivity in the presence of replacement plasma from nonimmune donors. In the standard membrane feeder assay (SMFA), cultured NF54 gametocytes are used to measure the capacity of endemic sera to block transmission. In the DMFA, 18 out of 48 sera (37.5%) from Cameroonian gametocyte carriers reduced transmission significantly, while in the SMFA 22 out of 48 sera (45.8%) produced transmission reduction. There was a positive correlation between both assays (r + 0.41, P < 0.05). Antibodies against epitopes of transmission-blocking target antigens Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 were measured in competition ELISAs and compared with the results of DMFA and SMFA. Serological reactivity in competition ELISAs against three epitopes of Pfs48/45 was significantly higher in the group of transmission-reducing sera in both the DMFA and the SMFA, especially for epitope III. No significant difference was found for Pfs230 antibodies (epitope I). Sensitivity of the serological assays was approximately 60%, with a specificity of around 70%. Serological tests cannot replace the functional bioassay in field situations as yet, but can contribute in the selection of sera for SMFA evaluation."

CD008122,0,8112044,0,Rapid diagnosis of malaria by use of fluorescent probes.,"Malaria diagnosis relies on observation of parasites in blood smears and the Giemsa-stained thick blood smear (G-TS) is the reference test. Diagnosis by G-TS in low-density infections requires long periods of observation and experienced microscopists. Examination of Giemsa-stained thin smears enables more reliable differentiation of species but may miss low-grade infections. Fluorescent stains may offer an alternative technique. We compared the Giemsa technique with 4,6-diamidine-2-phenilindolo-propidium iodide (DAPI-PI) stainings in order to evaluate the time required for diagnosis. A Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood specimen was diluted to obtain concentrations ranging from 6192 to 24 parasites/microliters (p/microliter), and thin and thick smears were stained with the two methods. The DAPI-PI proved useful: parasites were easily recognized and their morphology was preserved in thin and thick smears. The method allowed more rapid evaluation of thin smears as compared with Giemsa staining and enabled recognition of parasites in case of low-level parasitemias. The DAPI-PI staining technique may acquire an important role in malaria diagnosis, especially in nonendemic countries where technicians are not experienced with G-TS; in developing countries, it could be used in epidemiologic surveys of populations with low-density parasitemias, for which it enables a fast examination of smears and possibly the identification of parasite species."

Patients were assigned to one of five treatment groups: (i) a 5-day course of intravenous artesunate in a total dose of 600 mg, Group Aiv; (ii) intravenous artesunate as in Group Aiv followed by mefloquine, 25 mg/kg, Group Aiv+M; (iii) a 3-day course of intramuscular artemether in a total dose of 480 mg, Group Aim; (iv) intramuscular artemether as in Group Aim followed by mefloquine, 25 mg/kg, Group Aim+M, and (v) intravenous quinine, 200 mg/kg given in divided doses over seven days followed by oral tetracylcine, 10 mg/kg, for 7 days. When patients could take oral medications, the parenteral antimalarials were administered as oral agents. There were no major adverse effects observed with any of the five treatment regimens. With all regimens, 95 to 100% of the patients survived. Mean parasite clearance times were more rapid with the artemisinin regimens (53 to 62 hours) than with quinine (92 hours). The mean fever clearance times with intravenous artesunate (80 to 82 hours) were about a day shorter than those with intramuscular artemether (108 hours) or intravenous quinine (107 hours). Mefloquine reduced the recrudescence rate from 24 to 5% with intravenous artesunate but from 45 to 20% with intramuscular artemether; recrudescence was 4% with quinine and tetracycline. A dose and duration of therapy greater than those in this study are needed for optimal therapy with intramuscular artemether. Effective therapy for severe falciparum malaria can be provided by either intravenous artesunate followed by mefloquine or by intravenous quinine followed by tetracycline."

Prevalence and titers of immunoglobulins (Ig)G and IgG subclasses were periodically measured in 138 individuals (30 children under the age of ten and 108 villagers ten years old and older). In the younger group, seropositivity of total IgG against CS fluctuated according to the parasite infection rates; however, IgG seropositive reaction against RESA gradually increased. In the older age group, seropositivity of both kinds of antibodies was stable during the whole study period. Nevertheless, the geometric mean titers of total IgG against CS and RESA were significantly reduced in this latter group in individuals who contained these antibodies before and after intervention. The geometric mean titer of IgG3 subclass against RESA was decreased at a highly significant level (p = 0.0005), and that of IgG4 against the same antigen was also decreased although to a lesser extent (p = 0.02)."

Because prematurity is a risk factor for newborns, it is important to identify conditions that contribute to malaria-associated PTDs. Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes sequester in the placenta and attract activated mononuclear cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increased inflammatory cytokine levels in other microbial infections are associated with PTDs. To determine if such is the case in women with placental malaria, concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and IL-10 were measured in placental plasma of 391 malaria-infected and -uninfected Cameroonian women with premature and full-term deliveries. Risk factors for malaria-associated PTDs included peripheral and placental parasitemias greater than 1%, maternal anemia, elevated IL-10 levels, and low TNF-alpha:IL-10 ratios due to over-expression of IL-10. Alterations in cytokine levels may contribute to PTDs through the induction of anemia and/or altering cellular immune responses required for eliminating placental parasites."
CD008122,0,18367583,0,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 in blood, plasma, and serum.","Microscopy, the gold standard for the detection and quantification of malaria parasites in blood, is in many aspects deficient for this purpose. The method is poorly reproducible and can be inaccurate because Plasmodium falciparum parasites sequester for a portion of each asexual cycle. Due to these deficiencies, biomarkers such as P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) are increasingly being used. In this study, we evaluated the use of a commercial PfHRP2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit with some procedural modifications. We determined the linear range of the assay, including the lower limits of detection and quantitation, using recombinant PfHRP2 (rPfHRP2). In 10 repeat experiments, the linear range of optical densities (ODs) at 450 to 650 nm was from 0.05 +/- 0.002 to 2.28 +/- 0.042, corresponding to 3.91 to 250 ng/ml of rPfHRP2. The coefficient of variation (CV) at each target concentration ranged from 1.93 to 8.07%. Using cultured parasites, we confirmed the linear range of ODs as well as the association between the PfHRP2 ELISA results and the microscopic parasite densities. For whole-blood samples spiked with cultured, washed, ring-stage-infected red blood cells (iRBCs), the linear range was 11.7 to 750 iRBCs/microl, with CVs of 0.29 to 7.56%. The same spiked samples evaluated by microscopists had similar sensitivities, but the CVs were unacceptably high (20.7 to 161.6%). Stock rPfHRP2 was stable through four freeze-thaw cycles (P < 0.05; paired t test). When different patient sample types at different concentrations within the linear range of the assay are compared, the recoveries of PfHRP2 from blood and serum were within +/-20%, whereas the recoveries from plasma ranged between +35 and -41%. We conclude that PfHRP2 ELISA using whole-blood and serum samples is a suitable adjunct to microscopy and could ultimately benefit malaria intervention trials."
CD008122,0,16282292,0,Evaluation of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the diagnosis of malaria in patients from Thailand.,"We compared the diagnosis of malaria in 297 patients from Thailand by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using the LightCycler with conventional microscopy using Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films. The PCR assay can be completed in one hour and has the potential to detect and identify four species of Plasmodium in a single reaction by use of melting temperature curve analysis (however, we did not detect Plasmodium ovale in this study). Blood was collected, stored, and transported on IsoCode STIX, which provide a stable matrix for the archiving and rapid simple extraction of DNA. A genus-specific primer set corresponding to the 18S ribosomal RNA was used to amplify the target sequence. Fluorescence resonance energy technology hybridization probes were designed for P. falciparum over a region containing basepair mismatches, which allowed differentiation of the other Plasmodium species. The PCR results correlated with the microscopic results in 282 (95%) of 297 patient specimens. Most of these were single-species infections caused by P. vivax (150) and P. falciparum (120), along with 5 P. malariae, 2 mixed infections (P. falciparum and P. vivax), and 5 negative specimens. No negative microscopy specimens were positive by PCR (100% specificity for detection of any Plasmodium). The 15 discrepant results could not be resolved, but given the subjective nature of microscopy and the analytical objectivity of the PCR, the PCR results may be correct. The ability of the PCR method to detect mixed infections or to detect P. ovale could not be determined in this study. Within the limitations of initial equipment costs, this real-time PCR assay is a rapid, accurate, and efficient method for the specific diagnosis of malaria. It may have application in clinical laboratories, as well as in epidemiologic studies and antimalarial efficacy trials."
CD008122,0,16282293,1,Evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test for assessing the burden of malaria at delivery in India.,"All pregnant women who came for delivery at a district hospital in Mandla and a civil hospital in Maihar were screened for Plasmodium falciparum (placental parasitemia using a rapid test and microscopy and peripheral and umbilical cord parasitemia using microscopy alone). Two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), Paracheck Pf and ParaHITf, were used. At Mandla, the sensitivity and specificity of the Paracheck Pf for P. falciparum were 93% and 84%, respectively. The positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were 50% and 99%, respectively. At Maihar, the sensitivity and specificity of the ParaHITf for P. falciparum were 87.5% and 97%, respectively. The PPVs and NPVs were 75.4% and 98.7%, respectively. Placental infection was significantly associated with low birth weight. The RDTs for the identification of P. falciparum were more sensitive in placental blood than the placental blood smear by microscopy. Thus, the RDTs should be useful for rapid assessment of malaria at delivery."
CD008122,0,18410572,0,Studies in haemoglobin E beta-thalassaemia.,"Haemoglobin E beta-thalassaemia is the commonest form of severe thalassaemia in many Asian countries, but little is known about its natural history, the reasons for its clinical diversity, or its optimal management. Despite its frequency, haemoglobin E beta-thalassaemia is often managed in an ill-defined and haphazard way, usually by demand transfusion. We studied a cohort of Sri Lankan patients with haemoglobin E beta-thalassaemia over 5 years, and identified several genetic and environmental factors possibly contributing to the phenotypic diversity of the disorder. These included modifiers of haemoglobin F production, malaria and age-related changes in adaptation to anaemia. Our findings suggest that in many patients, haemoglobin E beta-thalassaemia can be managed without transfusion, even with low haemoglobin levels. Age-related changes in the pattern of adaptation to anaemia suggest that more cost-effective approaches to management should be explored."
CD008122,0,16774688,0,A database of antimalarial drug resistance.,"A large investment is required to develop, license and deploy a new antimalarial drug. Too often, that investment has been rapidly devalued by the selection of parasite populations resistant to the drug action. To understand the mechanisms of selection, detailed information on the patterns of drug use in a variety of environments, and the geographic and temporal patterns of resistance is needed. Currently, there is no publically-accessible central database that contains information on the levels of resistance to antimalaria drugs. This paper outlines the resources that are available and the steps that might be taken to create a dynamic, open access database that would include current and historical data on clinical efficacy, in vitro responses and molecular markers related to drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The goal is to include historical and current data on resistance to commonly used drugs, like chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and on the many combinations that are now being tested in different settings. The database will be accessible to all on the Web. The information in such a database will inform optimal utilization of current drugs and sustain the longest possible therapeutic life of newly introduced drugs and combinations. The database will protect the valuable investment represented by the development and deployment of novel therapies for malaria."
CD008122,0,10163571,0,Economic implications of resistance to antimalarial drugs.,"The widespread evolution of drug resistance in malarial parasites has seriously hampered efforts to control this debilitating disease. Chloroquine, the mainstay of malaria treatment for many decades, is now proving largely ineffective in many parts of the world, particularly against the most severe form of malaria--falciparum. Alternative drugs have been developed, but they are frequently less safe and are all between 50 and 700% more expensive than chloroquine. Choice of drug clearly has important budgetary implications and national malaria control programmes need to weigh up the costs and benefits in deciding whether to change to more effective but more expensive drugs. The growth in drug resistance also has implications for the choice of diagnostic tool. Clinical diagnosis of malaria is relatively cheap, but less specific than some technological approaches. As more expensive drugs are employed, the cost of wasted treatment on suspected cases who do not in fact have malaria rises and the more worthwhile it becomes to invest in more specific diagnostic techniques. This paper presents an economic framework for analysing the various malaria drug and diagnostic tool options available. It discusses the nature of the key factors that need to be considered when making choices of malaria treatment (including treatment costs, drug resistance, the costs of treatment failure and compliance) and diagnosis (including diagnosis cost and accuracy, and the often overlooked costs associated with delayed treatment), and uses some simple equations to illustrate the impact of these on the relative cost effectiveness of the alternatives being considered. On the basis of some simplifying assumptions and illustrative calculations, it appears that in many countries more effective drugs and more specific and rapid diagnostic approaches will be worth adopting even although they imply additional expense."
CD008122,0,8649263,0,Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of new antimalarials.,"Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is now widespread in Africa, requiring new drugs for the control of both non-severe and severe forms of the disease. For non-severe malaria, pyrimethamine-sulphadoxine, an antifolate combination antimalarial, is at present efficacious, single-dose and cheap; important characteristics for treatments in Africa. However, alternative combinations are being investigated which are intrinsically more active, less toxic and with shorter elimination half-lives. In theory, short half-life compounds reduce the selective pressure for resistance, which may be a major determinant of the useful therapeutic life of an antimalarial drug. The potential advantages/disadvantages of alternative antifolates is discussed. While the use of mefloquine and halofantrine in Africa is at present limited by cost, these drugs are likely replacements for the antifolates when parasite resistance arises. For severe, life-threatening falciparum malaria, quinine remains the treatment of choice. In contrast to quinine, artemether rapidly reduces the viability of circulating, ring-stage parasites, produces more rapid parasite clearance and may reduce the length of coma, but does not significantly reduce the mortality of severe malaria which remains at about 15% even with optimal management. It seems unlikely that chemotherapy, even with ""new"" antimalarials, will reduce this high figure. Other strategies are required."
CD008122,0,16172468,0,Detection of Plasmodium falciparum in pregnancy by laser desorption mass spectrometry.,"Detection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria during pregnancy is complicated by sequestration of parasites in the placenta, which reduces peripheral blood microscopic detection. Laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) has previously demonstrated sensitive detection of hemozoin from P. falciparum blood cultures and the ability to track parasitemia in a Plasmodium yoelii malaria mouse model. Here we use a simple, dilution in water, blood sample preparation protocol for LDMS detection of malaria in 45 asymptomatic, pregnant Zambian women. We compare LDMS to microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. All women were microscopy negative. LDMS detected P. falciparum hemozoin in 15 out of 45 women, while PCR results were positive in 25 women. Compared with PCR, which analyzed 20-30 microL of blood, the sensitivity of LDMS, which analyzed < 1 microL of blood, was 52%, with a specificity of 92%. LDMS is a potentially rapid and more sensitive alternate diagnostic method than microscopy."
CD008122,0,8649265,0,Randomised trial of SPf66 vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in southern Tanzania.,"Malaria, especially that due to Plasmodium falciparum, is one of the most important parasitic disease in man. It causes more than 400 million cases per year and between 1 to 3 million deaths, mainly among young children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. The current malaria control strategies using rapid diagnosis and treatment as well as methods to reduce the man-vector contact have had limited success. In Kilombero district (Southern Tanzania), malaria transmission is perennial (parasite prevalence > or = 80% all year) and intense (approximatively 300 infectious bites per year). At the household level, each under-5 child suffers on average 3 clinical fever episodes per year. Minimum estimated community rates for serious malaria (cerebral malaria or malaria and anaemia) affect approximatively 5% of all children. Under conditions of a field experiment, the annual incidence of a febrile illness (axillary temperature > or = 37.5 degrees C) reported to the curative primary health services in each child was 0.86 of which 0,35 can be attributed to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The best estimate of the SPf66 vaccine protective efficacy in the Kilombero was 31% (95% CI : 0.52)."

A phase I-IIb double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial was undertaken in 120 children aged 5-9 years. Subjects were randomised in four groups: (i) No sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)+vaccine, (ii) No SP+placebo, (iii) SP+vaccine, (iv) SP+placebo. 15 microg of each protein were given in the thigh, at both first and second injection (4 weeks apart). The placebo was adjuvant emulsified with saline. No serious or severe AEs occurred. Moderate AEs were seen in 3% of the vaccine and 3% of the placebo recipients after first injection and in 12 and 10% after second injection. The vaccine induced significant antibody responses to all three antigens but triggered an IFN-gamma response to MSP1 only. At Week 12, the IFN-gamma response to MSP1 was substantially higher in the vaccine group where No SP had been given. Combination B proved to be safe and immunogenic in children aged 5-9 years. Vaccine immunogenicity was neither impaired by circulating parasites nor increased after pre-treatment with SP and pre-treatment is not advisable in future trials of malaria vaccines, at least for those including blood-stage antigens."

The anti-PvMSP1-IgG antibody was observed in 110 individuals (55%). Among IgG responders, IgG1 coexpressed with IgG3 were the predominant subclasses. The levels of anti-PvMSP1 total IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 antibody response seem to be increased with age although no detectable significant correlation was found (r = 0.004, p = 0.484 for total IgG; r = 0.035, p = 0.386 for IgG1; r = -0.600, p = 0.142 for IgG2; r = 0.077, p = 0.227 for IgG3; r = 0.664, p = 0.051 for IgG4). However, the mean level of specific total IgG was highest in the age group of >40 years. These levels of either specific total IgG or each IgG isotype did not vary among individuals with different malaria episodes. A higher level of specific total IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 antibody response related with the lower of parasitemia density was observed although no significant correlation was found. Our data indicate that individuals exposed to vivax malaria in Thailand developed antibodies to the potential candidate vaccine antigen, PvMSP1 (C-terminal)."

We have established the capacity of DNA vaccines encoding Plasmodium antigens to induce CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte and interferon-gamma responses in mice, monkeys and humans. However, like others, we have found that the first or second generation DNA vaccines on their own are not optimal, and have demonstrated the potential of heterologous prime/boost immunisation strategies involving priming with DNA and boosting with poxvirus or recombinant protein in adjuvant. In this review, we summarise the current status and promise of our programmatic efforts to develop a DNA-based vaccine against malaria, our Multi-Stage Malaria DNA Vaccine Operation, and illustrate the transition of promising developments in the laboratory to clinical assessment in humans."

For this, serum samples from 229 patients were used, grouped as American tegmental leishmaniasis (n masculine=58), visceral leishmaniasis (n masculine=28), Chagas disease (n masculine=49), malaria (n masculine=32), tuberculosis (n masculine=13) and healthy volunteers (n masculine=49). Samples from American tegmentary leishmaniasis showed higher reactivity with antigens isolated from the Leishmania braziliensis complex than with antigens from Leishmania amazonensis (p<0.001). ELISA assays showed a sensitivity range from 60% to 95% with antigens isolated from the Leishmania braziliensis complex. There was marked nonspecific reactivity among serum samples with the use of antigenic fractions binding with concanavalin-A and jacalin from both Leishmania complexes, in comparison with other antigens (p<0.001). The results presented in this study suggest that the use of homologous antigens increases the efficiency of anti-Leishmania immunoglobulin detection, which may be very valuable for diagnostic purposes."
CD008122,0,18569149,0,Baseline health situation of communities affected by the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric project in central Lao PDR and indicators for monitoring.,"Hydroelectric projects offer opportunities for infrastructure development and economic growth; yet, if not well designed, implemented and operated, they have the potential to negatively affect the health and well-being of local and distant downstream communities. Remote rural populations are particularly vulnerable to the sudden influx of men, materials and money, and associated population mixing that accompany project construction phases. Two large-scale baseline health surveys, carried out in 2001/2002 in two communities that were affected by the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric project in central Lao PDR, were analysed. For the population to be resettled on the Nakai plateau it was observed that access to clean water and basic sanitation facilities was lacking. Faecal examinations revealed a high infection prevalence for Ascaris lumbricoides (67.7%), but relatively low prevalences for hookworm (9.7%), Taenia spp. (4.8%), Enterobius vermicularis (4.4%), Trichuris trichiura (3.9%), Strongyloides stercoralis (1.4%) and Opisthorchis viverrini (0.9%). For the population in the Xe Bang Fai downstream area, rapid diagnostic tests for malaria carried out in the rainy season found a prevalence below 1%, which might be explained by the complete coverage of households with insecticide-treated nets (99.8%). Anthropometric measurements in both populations suggest that wasting, stunting and underweight in under 5-year-old children were moderate to high; 15.9-17.5%, 40.4-55.7% and 35.8-55.7%, respectively. One out of six individuals aged above 14 years were malnourished, most likely as a result of early childhood wasting. Moderate anaemia, assessed by age- and sex-specific haemoglobin levels, was present in 43.8% (Nakai) and 54.9% of the individuals examined (Xe Bang Fai). Several indicators were extracted that can be utilised for monitoring changes in health, well-being and equity, as the project is implemented and operated."
CD008122,0,1967504,0,Evaluation of an ELISA kit for epidemiological detection of antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in human sera and bloodspot eluates.,"Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites represent a serological transmission indicator, which can be applied in epidemiological studies to estimate the intensity of malaria transmission. An ELISA method has been developed as an industrial kit to detect these antibodies, using a chemically synthesized (NANP)40 peptide as antigen. The results obtained with this kit are compared in the present paper with those obtained by an ELISA test already applied in epidemiological studies. In testing sera from individuals living in endemic areas, a high diagnostic concordance (92.1%) was obtained between the two assays. The absorbances of these sera correlated well, as shown by a correlation coefficient r = 0.877. Sera from individuals never exposed to malaria gave very low absorbances with the kit. This minimum non-specific binding increases the probability of comparable results in different studies. When the two ELISAs were evaluated for analytical sensitivity and precision, similar satisfactory results were achieved. The test can be performed not only with sera but also with eluates from filterpaper bloodspots. Modifications of the kit to reduce its cost and suggestions regarding distribution and funding are also proposed."

CD008122,0,19091039,0,Working without a blindfold: the critical role of diagnostics in malaria control.,"Diagnostic testing for malaria has for many years been eschewed, lest it be an obstacle to the delivery of rapid, life-saving treatment. The approach of treating malaria without confirmatory testing has been reinforced by the availability of inexpensive treatment with few side effects, by the great difficulty of establishing quality-assured microscopy in rural and resource-poor settings, and by the preeminence of malaria as a cause of important fever in endemic regions. Within the last decade, all three of these factors have changed. More expensive artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) has been widely introduced, simple immunochromatographic tests for malaria have been developed that can be used as an alternative to microscopy by village health workers, and recognition of the health cost of mismanaging non-malarial fever is growing. In most of the world a small fraction of fever is due to malaria, and reflex treatment with ACT does not make medical or economic sense. Global malaria control efforts have been energized by the availability of new sources of funding, and by the rapid reduction in malaria prevalence in a number of settings where bed nets, indoor residual spraying with insecticides, and ACT have been systematically deployed. This momentum has been captured by a new call for malaria elimination. Without wide implementation of accurate and discriminating diagnostic testing, and reporting of results, most fever will be inappropriately managed, millions of doses of ACT will be wasted, and malaria control programmes will be blindfolded to the impact of their efforts."
CD008122,0,19091038,0,Integrated vector management for malaria control.,"Integrated vector management (IVM) is defined as ""a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control"" and includes five key elements: 1) evidence-based decision-making, 2) integrated approaches 3), collaboration within the health sector and with other sectors, 4) advocacy, social mobilization, and legislation, and 5) capacity-building. In 2004, the WHO adopted IVM globally for the control of all vector-borne diseases. Important recent progress has been made in developing and promoting IVM for national malaria control programmes in Africa at a time when successful malaria control programmes are scaling-up with insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and/or indoor residual spraying (IRS) coverage. While interventions using only ITNs and/or IRS successfully reduce transmission intensity and the burden of malaria in many situations, it is not clear if these interventions alone will achieve those critical low levels that result in malaria elimination. Despite the successful employment of comprehensive integrated malaria control programmes, further strengthening of vector control components through IVM is relevant, especially during the ""end-game"" where control is successful and further efforts are required to go from low transmission situations to sustained local and country-wide malaria elimination. To meet this need and to ensure sustainability of control efforts, malaria control programmes should strengthen their capacity to use data for decision-making with respect to evaluation of current vector control programmes, employment of additional vector control tools in conjunction with ITN/IRS tactics, case-detection and treatment strategies, and determine how much and what types of vector control and interdisciplinary input are required to achieve malaria elimination. Similarly, on a global scale, there is a need for continued research to identify and evaluate new tools for vector control that can be integrated with existing biomedical strategies within national malaria control programmes. This review provides an overview of how IVM programmes are being implemented, and provides recommendations for further development of IVM to meet the goals of national malaria control programmes in Africa."

Although there was a significant trend of increasing prevalence of anti-P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) with age, there was no significant increase in the antibody units of IgG recognizing P. falciparum CS proteins. Antibodies recognizing P. vivax CS proteins steadily increased in prevalence and antibody units with age. Significant trends of increasing prevalence of antibody responders (both IgG and IgM) with increasing splenic enlargement were found in the younger age groups for P. falciparum CS proteins but not for P. vivax CS proteins. When antibody responders were analyzed by quartiles, there was a trend of increasing antibody response with age against P. vivax CS peptide, but not for P. falciparum CS protein. There was no evidence for increasing protection against blood-stage infections with increasing antibody levels for either P. falciparum or P. vivax. Neither were any significant relationships found between entomological inoculation rates and either CS antibody prevalence or concentration among the villages studied."

The assay consistently detected one infected mosquito in a pool of 10 or 20 mosquitoes, and was 100% specific in discriminating between species of Plasmodium when mosquito suspensions were spiked with sporozoites.

Unfortunately, these approaches require laboratory materials not available in poor countries where the disease is endemic. The correct diagnosis of VL is important, and made more difficult by the fact that several common tropical diseases such as malaria, disseminated tuberculosis, and enteric fever share the same clinical presentation. Serological tests have been developed to replace parasitological diagnosis in the field. A commercially available K39-based strip test for VL has been developed for this purpose. The endemic area of leishmaniasis in Brazil overlaps the endemic area of Chagas disease, a disease that can cause false-positive serological test results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of false-positive exams using a rapid test for VL in patients with Chagas disease."
CD008122,0,6370836,0,The accumulation of lactic acid and its influence on the growth of Plasmodium falciparum in synchronized cultures.,"Synchronization of Plasmodium falciparum cultured in vitro results in a one-step growth pattern that allows the study of stage-specific metabolic activities of the parasites. Lactic acid (LA) was selected as a metabolic marker, and the concentration of this end product found in spent media was correlated with the different erythrocytic stages of the parasites. When the medium was changed at 12 h intervals, cultures containing predominantly trophozoites produced 3.66 +/- 0.55 mumol LA per 12 h per 10(7) parasitized cells (n = 26), an amount of LA that is about 8 to 20 times higher than that found in corresponding cultures containing predominantly ring forms. Depending on the stage of development, parasitized red blood cells produced between 5 and 100 times more LA than uninfected erythrocytes (3.72 +/- 0.62 mumol LA per 12 hours per 10(9) red blood cells) (n = 41) when cultured under identical conditions. The intraerythrocytic development of the parasites was not impaired by exposure to extracellular concentrations of LA up to 12 mM over a 12 h period. The growth resulting in such cultures was described as uninhibited and was characterized by a multiplication index of 10 or higher. Above the threshold of 12 mM of LA, progressive inhibition of parasite development occurred. The stage-specific LA production reported can be used to predict the amount of LA that will have accumulated at the end of a subsequent 12 h incubation period during synchronized in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum. Using these values, it is possible to establish an optimal medium exchange schedule, thereby assuring uninhibited growth and a correspondingly high parasite yield."

The test is specific to P.falciparum and has a sensitivity close to that usually achieved with Giemsa-stained blood films. The reagents employed are stable at refrigerator temperatures for over 6 months, and as the test is compatible with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B surface antigen ELISAs it could be suitable for blood transfusion screening."
CD008122,0,8465389,0,Field study of an antigen-detection ELISA specific for Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"We field-tested a specific antigen-detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the histidine-rich protein of Plasmodium falciparum, in a district hospital in Thailand. The test was simple to perform, takes less than 3 h to complete, can deal with batches of sera, be read visually, and was 98.05% sensitive and 96.22% specific. However, 3 of 154 microscopically identified P. falciparum cases gave false negative ELISA results. One of these patients had been admitted to hospital for P. falciparum malaria 3 months previously and all 3 came from hyperendemic villages and were thought to have had previous episodes of malaria, possibly resulting in high titres of circulating blocking antibody. The test was more sensitive when whole blood was frozen and thawed before testing. This test is promising but requires further refinement to eliminate false negatives before it can be used safely for screening acutely ill patients for falciparum malaria. The sensitivity of this ELISA appears to be sufficiently high to consider it as a tool for blood donor screening in regions with a high prevalence of P. falciparum carriers with low parasitaemia. There is at present no satisfactory routine screening method for large numbers of blood donors for malaria."
CD008122,0,14552743,1,Role of the Parasight-F test in the diagnosis of complicated Plasmodium falciparum malarial infection.,"An evaluation was made of the diagnostic efficacy and utility of the Parasight-F test in diagnosing Plasmodium falciparum malaria, compared with conventional microscopy, particularly in severe and complicated cases. This study was designed as a prospective, case control hospital-based study. Febrile patients suspected to be suffering from malaria were selected randomly and were subjected to peripheral smear examinations (thick and thin) and Parasight-F tests till the required number of at least 30 cases of P. falciparum infection were identified, including at least 15 complicated cases. In addition 20 cases of P. vivax malarial infection as well as 20 healthy age and sex-matched individuals were taken as two control groups. The outcome measure was the number of cases with positive Parasight-F test results compared with conventional microscopy. Thirty-two patients with P. falciparum malaria were identified, with 15 severe and complicated cases. Peripheral smears were positive in 29 (91%) of these, while parasight-F test was positive in 31 out of 32 (97%) cases. Parasites were detected only by bone marrow examination in one case. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of peripheral smears for detecting falciparum infection were 90.6% and 100% respectively while that of the Parasight-F test were 96.8% and 100%, respectively (P>.05). The Parasight-F test has high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing P. falciparum malarial infection, comparable to or even higher than microscopy exams, particularly in severe and complicated cases, with additional advantages of speed, simplicity and objectivity."
CD008122,0,19689738,0,The relationship between human effector and memory T cells measured by ex vivo and cultured ELISPOT following recent and distal priming.,"Maintenance of T-cell responses is an essential feature in protection from many infectious diseases that must be harnessed in vaccination. The relationship between effector T-cell responses and more durable and highly proliferative T-cell memory, particularly in humans, is not well understood. In this study, effector T-cell responses were measured by overnight ex vivo interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot-forming cell assay (ELISPOT), whereas memory T cells were measured by 10-day culture followed by IFN-gamma ELISPOT (cultured ELISPOT). We observed a significant correlation between IFN-gamma responses to CD4-stimulatory, but not to CD8-stimulatory, recall antigens measured by these assays, suggesting a divergence in regulation. In vaccine trial participants who received a prime-boost vaccination regimen comprising malaria antigens delivered by poxviruses, there was a correlation between ex vivo and cultured responses on day 7, but not 3 months post-vaccination, with the ratio of cultured : ex vivo response increasing over time. To compare responses revealed by cultured ELISPOT in more detail, tetramers comprising viral recall antigens were used to ascribe effector-memory and central-memory T-cell phenotypes through CCR7 and CD62L costaining. For CD8(+) responses the effector phenotype decreased during the initial culture period and memory populations remained high within the resulting 20-fold to 50-fold increased IFN-gamma-secreting or tetramer(+) population. This was less marked for CD4(+) responses, which had higher starting memory phenotype. Depletion of these central-memory T-cell populations generally ablated responses in cultured ELISPOT and reduced ex vivo responses. This study highlights differences between CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector and memory T cells, and the more complex phenotype of CD4(+) T cells."
CD008122,0,12581436,0,Plasma glucose and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in adult patients with severe falciparum malaria.,"Plasma glucose was assessed in 81 patients with severe falciparum malaria at the time of presentation along with tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The lowest plasma glucose value was 3.38 mmol/l and none of the patients had hypoglycaemia at admission. Plasma glucose values were not significantly lower in those with multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) than in patients with single organ dysfunction (cerebral malaria only) and in those who died compared with patients who survived. Conversely, TNF-alpha showed a good correlation with depth of coma and was significantly higher in patients who had MOD and those who died. There was no correlation between plasma glucose and TNF-alpha values."

CD008122,0,14974756,0,The Global TB Drug Facility: innovative global procurement.,"The Global TB Drug Facility (GDF) is a new initiative to increase access to high quality tuberculosis drugs. The GDF, a project of the Global Partnership to Stop TB, is managed by its secretariat, in the World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva. It aims to provide tuberculosis drugs to treat up to 11.6 million patients over the next 5 years and to assist countries to reach the WHO global TB control targets by 2005. The GDF was launched on 24 March 2001. Six rounds of applications have been completed, with 46 countries and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) approved for support. The GDF is not a traditional procurement mechanism. It has adopted an innovative approach to the supply of drugs, by linking demand for drugs to supply and monitoring, using partners to provide services, using product packaging to simplify drug management and linking grants to TB programme performance. This paper describes the GDF operational procedures and experience gained so far. Key achievements to date are also outlined, including the creation of a flexible supply system to meet differing programme needs, rapid establishment of procedures, reduction in TB drug prices--a catalyst for DOTS expansion in countries, standardisation of products, and collaboration with partners. The GDF is flexible enough to meet the needs of countries with a TB burden. The GDF experience could be used as an example for global procurement of drugs and commodities for other diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. In the future it is likely that the GDF will expand to include second-line drugs and diagnostic materials for TB and could assist other partnerships to develop similar mechanisms and facilities to meet country needs."
CD008122,0,10363739,0,Safety and efficacy of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride for the prophylaxis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in South Africa.,"The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride combination therapy for the prophylaxis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in at-risk nonimmune subjects in South Africa. This open-label trial was conducted at research sites in South Africa during the main malaria transmission season, February through July. The study volunteers were temporarily living in, or traveling to, a malaria-endemic area. They received I tablet of 250 mg atovaquone and 100 mg proguanil hydrochloride once daily for up to 10 weeks. Subjects were monitored using sequential clinical and laboratory assessments. Thick blood smears were stained and evaluated by a central laboratory. An immunochromatographic test for P. falciparum was also used for on-site patient management. Prophylactic success was summarized using a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects who did not develop parasitemia or who withdrew due to a treatment-related adverse event. A total of 175 subjects (15% women) were enrolled in the trial. The mean duration of drug exposure was 8.9 weeks. The combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride was well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events considered possibly related to study treatment were headache (7%), abdominal pain (2%), increased cough (2%), and skin disorder (2%). No serious adverse events were reported, and no treatment-emergent effects were noted for any laboratory variables. One subject who was noncompliant with therapy developed parasitemia, and 3 subjects withdrew due to a treatment-related adverse event (2 subjects with headache and 1 with nausea and dizziness). The prophylaxis success rate was 97%. In this study, atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride combination therapy had an excellent safety and efficacy profile for prophylaxis of P. falciparum malaria in nonimmune subjects."
CD008122,0,15638301,1,Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase assay to detect malarial parasites.,"Microscopic examination of blood smears remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of malaria. However, it is labour-intensive and requires skilled operators. Immunochromatographic dipstick assays provide a potential alternative. One such dipstick, the Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase assay (pLDH), is based on detection of the Plasmodium intracellular metabolic enzyme, LDH. The differentiation of malarial parasites is based on the antigenic differences between the pLDH isoforms. This study was designed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of pLDH assays in detecting and differentiating between various malarial species compared with microscopy."
CD008122,0,17113021,0,Antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate antigens in three areas distinct with respect to altitude.,"Antibody levels against malaria antigens were measured among patients presenting with uncomplicated malaria at health centers from three locations in Zimbabwe (Bindura, Chiredzi and Kariba) that are distinct with regard to altitude and climatic conditions. Antibody levels were determined by ELISA using the antigens, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1), erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA-175), circumsporozoite surface protein (CSP), merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) and Pfg27. For all the antigens tested, IgG and IgM levels were higher for Bindura (altitude 1100 m) compared to Kariba (<600 m, altitude) and Chiredzi (approximately 600 m, altitude) with the exception of IgG and IgM to AMA-1 and EBA-175 which were similar between Chiredzi and Bindura. Plasma samples were further analyzed for their functional activity by testing their ability to inhibit the growth of Plasmodium falciparum in culture. Our results, determined by microscopy and verified by the LDH assay revealed that plasma from the three locations had similar inhibitory activity against the growth of P. falciparum in vitro. Our data revealed that highest growth inhibition correlated with the highest levels of MSP-1 antibody values."
CD008122,0,15996634,0,Epidemiology and surveillance: changing the global picture of malaria--myth or reality?,"The burden of malaria remains unacceptably high, and the greatest burden is borne by the African continent. There is now wide agreement on the control strategies and tools, and a considerable increase in global resources invested in malaria control efforts. However, challenges remain, especially with achieving the necessary population coverage with these interventions in order to change the epidemiology of the disease. Existing tools may not be optimal, and are liable to fail with time, just as previous ones did. Current global antimalarial efforts need to be underpinned by a strong research and development agenda. If all these factors are taken into consideration, reducing the burden of malaria would seem more like a reality than a myth in the foreseeable future."
CD008122,0,11728042,1,Evaluation of a dipstick test for the rapid diagnosis of imported malaria among patients presenting within the network TropNetEurop.,"Lack of experience on the part of involved laboratory personnel frequently complicates swift diagnosis of imported falciparum malaria in non-endemic areas. Diagnostic tools based on the dipstick principle for the detection of plasmodial histidine-rich protein 2 have been marketed for several years and have been extensively evaluated. Recently, a test kit capable of detecting antigen of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax has been introduced. In order to evaluate this newly available tool, specimens from 664 patients were screened during the course of a prospective multicentre study within the European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance (TropNetEurop). Among the screened specimens, samples from 82 patients (12.3%) were positive for falciparum malaria using expert microscopy. A further 17 samples were positive for vivax malaria. The evaluated test kit performed with a sensitivity of 87.8% and a specificity of 99% for detection of falciparum malaria. Respective values for vivax malaria were 76.5% and 100%. Dipstick tests have the potential of improving the speed and accuracy of the diagnosis of falciparum malaria, especially if non-specialized laboratories are involved. However, decreased values of sensitivity and specificity, in comparison with expert microscopy, still impose a clear limit on the usefulness of the currently available kits."
CD008122,0,10869334,0,Assessment of different sources of variation in the antibody responses to specific malaria antigens in children in Papua New Guinea.,"A potential problem for malaria vaccine development and testing is between-host variation in antibody responses to specific malaria antigens. Previous work in adults in an area highly endemic for Plasmodium falciparum in Papua New Guinea found that genetic regulation partly explained heterogeneity in responsiveness. We have now assessed the relative contributions of environmental and genetic factors in total IgG responses to specific malaria antigens in children, and quantified temporal variation within individuals of total IgG responses."
CD008122,0,12435112,0,Immunoglobulin G and subclass responses to Plasmodium falciparum antigens: a study in highly exposed Cameroonians.,"We conducted a cross-sectional study in Bolifamba village in the South West Province of Cameroon to determine antibody responses to crude Plasmodium falciparum antigens. A total of 347 subjects were examined. Parasite counts were obtained on thick blood films stained with Field's stain. Total immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgG subclass levels were determined in serum samples from four groups comprising children 1 to 5 years old and adults > or = 18 years with or without falciparum malaria parasites, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with crude blood-stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum strain F32 as target. Depending on the age group, malaria prevalence varied between 10% and 65% with a mean of 30.8%. Prevalence rate and parasite density declined with increasing age. Total IgG and IgG1-3 levels were significantly higher in adults than in children (p < 0.05). Parasite-bearing individuals in both age groups had higher IgG titres than their non-infected counterparts, while subtype levels were not significantly different (p = 0.05). These findings indicate that Bolifamba village could be a convenient site to study further the protective immunity to malaria."

CD008122,0,9715940,0,Incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection in infants in relation to exposure to sporozoite-infected anophelines.,"The relationship of the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection to entomologic inoculation rates (EIRs) was studied in 163 children less than one year of age in a Tanzanian village to determine likely effects of transmission-reducing interventions on infection incidence. A total of 66,727 Anopheles gambiae s.l. and 17,620 An. funestus mosquitoes were caught in 1,056 light trap collections from 139 houses over a period of more than two years. Time period-specific human biting rates were estimated for 11 village neighborhoods. Sporozoites were detected by ELISA in 4.4% of the An. funestus and 2.5% of the An. gambiae s.l. Eight hundred seventeen pairs of blood slides with approximately two-week intervals between slides were used to estimate incidence of parasitemia by fitting reversible catalytic models to parasite positivity data. Estimated EIRs during the four weeks preceding each intersurvey interval averaged 1.6 (SD = 2.1) per adult per night. Parasites were present at the end of 31% of the 443 intervals that commenced with a parasite-negative slide. Attack rates were comparable with those in western Kenya, and the proportion of bites resulting in human infections was strongly dependent on mosquito density. Incidence of infection increased with the EIR up to approximately one bite from a sporozoite-carrying mosquito per adult per night. However, higher levels of transmission observed locally in the wet season did not result in a correspondingly higher incidence. These data suggest that transmission-reducing measures cannot be expected to reduce incidence of infection at the highest levels of EIR."
CD008122,0,15259467,0,"The operation, quality and costs of a district hospital laboratory service in Malawi.","Laboratory services are run down in many low-income countries, severely constraining their input to patient care and disease surveillance. There are few data about the quality and cost of individual components of the laboratory service in poorer countries, yet this information is essential if optimal use is to be made of scarce resources. Staff time, range of tests, workload, and safety procedures were monitored over 12 months (1997-98) in a typical district hospital laboratory in Malawi. Data were collected to calculate the total economic cost of these services. Of the 31203 tests performed, 84% were to support blood transfusion and diagnosis of malaria and tuberculosis (TB). Test quality was reasonable for malaria and TB microscopy and blood transfusion, but poor for haemoglobin estimation. The cost per test ranged from US dollars 0.35 for haemoglobin to US dollars 11.7 per unit of blood issued and the total annual cost of the laboratory service was US dollars 32618. Blood transfusion and microscopy for malaria and TB comprised the majority of tests. Ensuring that these tests are of the highest quality will therefore have the most impact in reducing wastage of laboratory resources. Inadequate quality of haemoglobin estimations is a particular problem. The findings of this study are likely to be relevant to other low-income countries with similar disease burdens."
CD008122,0,18814727,0,PCR-based methods to the diagnosis of imported malaria.,"Rapid and precise diagnosis of malaria is needed to take care febrile patient returning from endemic areas. Since the first description of the diagnosis of Plasmodium infection by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR), the role of this kind of molecular method in the laboratory diagnosis of imported malaria is still a topical question. PCR-based assays were found to be more sensitive and more specific than all conventional methods. The highest contribution of the molecular diagnosis is that a PCR negative result would ascertain the lack of any malaria infection, thus quickly orienting the investigations toward other aetiology. This technique should be now considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of imported malaria."
CD008122,0,15259463,0,Simultaneous identification of the four human Plasmodium species and quantification of Plasmodium DNA load in human blood by real-time polymerase chain reaction.,"The incidence of imported malaria cases in travellers returning from endemic areas has considerably increased over the last few years. The microscopical examination of stained blood films is the gold standard method to confirm clinical suspicion of malaria but diagnosis is difficult in the case of mixed infections, low-grade parasitaemia, or forms altered by uncompleted treatment. We have developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the simultaneous identification of the 4 human Plasmodium spp. and quantification of Plasmodium DNA in human blood. The rapid turnaround and reduction in the risk of PCR product carryover are major advantages compared with conventional PCR. In combination with conventional tests, this method could be a powerful tool for the diagnosis of malaria infections among travellers from endemic areas and during the follow-up of patients in reference centres involved in travel and tropical medicine. Quantitative real-time PCR could also be used for the follow-up of patients during drug resistance studies managed by national malaria programmes, the testing of new drugs, and vaccine trials."

CD008122,0,12965906,0,Development and evaluation of a Western blot kit for diagnosis of human trichinellosis.,"We evaluated industrially prepared Western blot strips designed to avoid the cross-reactions observed with indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays used for the serodiagnosis of trichinellosis. The antigen preparations were crude extracts of Trichinella spiralis. The Western blot profile characteristic of trichinellosis was characterized by comparing 60 sera from patients infected by Trichinella to 11 sera from healthy subjects, 51 sera from patients with other proven parasitic diseases (cysticercosis, schistosomiasis, strongyloidosis, fascioliasis, toxocariasis, liver amebiasis, anisakiasis, filariasis, toxoplasmosis, hydatidosis, or malaria), and 23 sera from patients with autoantibodies. Specific 43- to 44-kDa and 64-kDa bands were obtained with all of the sera from 51 patients with acute trichinellosis, in 4 out of 9 patients at the early stages of the disease, and in only 1 control patient, who had suspected anisakiasis and in whom trichinellosis could not be ruled out by muscle biopsy."
CD008122,0,18383801,1,Antigen capture immuno-chromatographic strip format in detecting parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase to diagnose malaria in nonimmune patients.,"Several rapid diagnostic test devices (RDT) based on detection of malaria antigen in the whole blood were developed. OptiMal test the presence of parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme using three monoclonal antibodies was used. Two monoclonal antibodies were pan-specific and recognized all malaria species. The third one was specific only for Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite antigens were detected using an antigen-capture immunochromatographic strip format. One hundred-nine malaria positive and 730 malaria negative cases diagnosed by microscopy were included. 75/109 were P. falciparum 26 as P. vivax, 3 P. malariae and 5 mixed infection of P. falciparum & P. vivax. The RDT showed a low sensitivity (85%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 79-92%) with a much lower sensitivity in detecting species other than P. falciparum as well as in mixed infections. The sensitivity was 50% for less than 200 parasites/micro. The sensitivity of OptiMal for P. falciparum was 87% (95% CI, 79-94), 81% (95% CI, 66-96) for P. vivax, and failed with P. malariae. Mixed infections were misdiagnosed as Pfalciparum. The sensitivity of OptiMal was quite good in detecting both P. falciparum & P. vivax (98%; 95% CI, 97-99 & 100%; 95% CI, 100-100 respectively) and 99% (95% CI, 98-99) for all species. The positive and negative ratio for all malaria species was: (+LR = 62.3, -LR = 0.01); for P. falciparum (+LR = 38.9, -LR = 0.01) and for P. vivax (+LR = 0.8077/0, -LR = 0.2). The test value to assess drug resistance in post treatment days was discussed."
CD008122,0,3493860,0,ELISA tests for dapsone and pyrimethamine and their application in a malaria chemoprophylaxis programme.,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent asays (ELISAs) are described for determining levels of dapsone and pyrimethamine in urine. Both assays have a sensitivity of about 20 mug/l and are reproducible, but each produces some false positives. The problem of false positive reactions was partially obviated by requiring positive results in both assays. In a pilot study involving 50 children aged 3 months to 4 years who were given a single dose of Maloprim (pyrimethamine + dapsone), 75% were positive for dapsone 7 days after administration of the drug, while 25% were still positive 15 days after its administration. The corresponding proportions for pyrimethamine were 73% and 30%, respectively. Comparison of the results obtained in a larger chemoprophylaxis trial with those from the pilot study indicated that the assays described could be used to investigate whether antimalarials had been taken."
CD008122,0,19409508,0,"Impact of the IL-4 -590 C/T transition on the levels of Plasmodium falciparum specific IgE, IgG, IgG subclasses and total IgE in two sympatric ethnic groups living in Mali.","This study aimed to examine the effect of IL-4 -590 T/C polymorphism on the levels of malaria-specific IgE, IgG, IgG (1-4) subclasses as well as total IgE in the Fulani and their sympatric ethnic group, the Dogon, in Mali. Asymptomatic individuals, of the Fulani and the Dogon ethnic groups, were included in the study. IL-4 is involved in the regulation of IgE and IgG4 subclass. In line with this we found that within the Fulani, the T allele was associated with increased levels of total and anti-malarial IgE (P=0.02 and P=0.04, respectively). The Fulani T allele carriers had slightly higher levels of malarial specific IgG4 as compared to those with the CC genotype (P=0.08). No such differences were observed amongst the Dogon individuals. Taken together, these data indicate that the impact of IL-4 -590 variants on antibody levels may vary in different ethnic populations, and that this might affect the Ig-class and subclass distributions."
CD008122,0,10810013,0,A prospective evaluation of a clinical algorithm for the diagnosis of malaria in Gambian children.,"Diagnosis of clinical malaria remains difficult, especially in areas where a high proportion of the asymptomatic population have parasitaemia, for the symptoms and signs of malaria overlap with those of other common childhood diseases, such as acute lower respiratory tract infections. However, a study of symptoms and signs in a group of children who presented to Farafenni Health Centre, The Gambia with a history of recent fever identified a group of signs and symptoms which were strong predictors of malaria as opposed to other febrile illnesses. Using these predictors, an algorithm was developed which could be used by fieldworkers and which had a similar sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of malaria as that of an experienced paediatrician working without laboratory support. This algorithm has been validated prospectively on 518 children who presented to the Medical Research Council clinic at Basse, The Gambia with fever or a history of recent fever during a 10-month period. A fieldworker obtained a detailed history from the parent or guardian of each child and performed a clinical examination which included measurement of axillary temperature and respiratory rate. Packed cell volume was measured and a thick smear was examined for malaria parasites. A malaria score, based on the presence or absence of malaria-related signs and symptoms, was determined for 382 children who were seen at the clinic during the high transmission season. Using the cut-off score which was optimal during the previous retrospective study, a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 77% for a diagnosis of malaria was obtained. The optimal cut-off score for the Basse population was a score of 7; this gave a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 62%, figures comparable to those obtained by an experienced paediatrician without laboratory support."

CD008122,0,18703302,0,Detecting counterfeit antimalarial tablets by near-infrared spectroscopy.,"Counterfeit antimalarial drugs are found in many developing countries, but it is challenging to differentiate between genuine and fakes due to their increasing sophistication. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerful tool in pharmaceutical forensics, and we tested this technique for discriminating between counterfeit and genuine artesunate antimalarial tablets. Using NIRS, we found that artesunate tablets could be identified as genuine or counterfeit with high accuracy. Multivariate classification models indicated that this discriminatory ability was based, at least partly, on the presence or absence of spectral signatures related to artesunate. This technique can be field-portable and requires little training after calibrations are developed, thus showing great promise for rapid and accurate fake detection."
CD008122,0,8250629,0,Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite and entomological inoculation rates at the Ahero rice irrigation scheme and the Miwani sugar-belt in western Kenya.,"Anopheles arabiensis and An. funestus were collected by pyrethrum spray sheet collections in houses and by human-bait catches at a village in western Kenya adjacent to the Ahero rice irrigation scheme; and using the same methods, An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus were collected at Miwani, a village in the sugar-cane belt. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rates were determined by ELISA. At Ahero the mean sporozoite rates were 1.1% and 4.3% in An. arabiensis and An. funestus, respectively, while at Miwani the rates were 6.0% in An. gambiae s.l. and 4.3% in An. funestus. Entomolgoical inoculation rates (EIR) were derived from both human-bait collections (IR-HBC) and by the proportion of human blood-fed females caught resting indoors (IR-HBF). The IR-HBF appeared to be a more realistic index of EIR. At Ahero and Miwani people were exposed to an average of 416 and 91 infective bites/person/year, respectively. The main vectors were An. funestus at Ahero and An. gambiae s.l. at Miwani. In view of the intense and perennial malaria transmission at Ahero, vector control by insecticides should be considered, while at Miwani, where transmission is seasonal, permethrin-impregnated bed nets could be an alternative to indoor spraying. These measures must be augmented with availability of effective antimalarials."
CD008122,0,18930094,0,A phase 1 trial of PfCP2.9: an AMA1/MSP1 chimeric recombinant protein vaccine for Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) and Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (MSP1) were produced as a recombinant fusion protein and formulated with the adjuvant Montanide ISA 720 with the aim of replicating the structure present in the parasite protein. A previous trial with this construct demonstrated the vaccine was safe and immunogenic but was associated with injection site reactogenicity. This Phase 1a dose-escalating, double blind, randomized, controlled trial of PfCP2.9/Montanide ISA 720 was conducted to evaluate alternative dose levels and vaccination schedules, with a pre-formulated vaccine that had undergone more in-depth and frequent quality control and stability analysis. The trial was conducted in seventy healthy Chinese malaria-naïve volunteers between January 2006 and January 2007. The objective was to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 5, 20 and 50microg of PfCP2.9/ISA 720 under 2 different schedules. The most common adverse event was injection site tenderness (53%). The frequency and severity of adverse events was similar in both vaccination schedules. Antibody responses were induced and remained elevated throughout the study in volunteers receiving vaccine (p<0.001). Although high antibody titers as measured by ELISA to the PfCP2.9 immunogen were observed, biological function of these antibodies was not reflected by the in vitro inhibition of parasite growth, and there was limited recognition of fixed parasites in an immunofluorescence assay. At all three dose levels and both schedules, this formulation of PfCP2.9/ISA 720 is well tolerated, safe and immunogenic; however no functional activity against the parasite was observed."
CD008122,0,18959777,1,Operational accuracy and comparative persistent antigenicity of HRP2 rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a hyperendemic region of Uganda.,"Parasite-based diagnosis of malaria by microscopy requires laboratory skills that are generally unavailable at peripheral health facilities. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) require less expertise, but accuracy under operational conditions has not been fully evaluated in Uganda. There are also concerns about RDTs that use the antigen histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) to detect Plasmodium falciparum, because this antigen can persist after effective treatment, giving false positive test results in the absence of infection. An assessment of the accuracy of Malaria Pf immuno-chromatographic test (ICT) and description of persistent antigenicity of HRP2 RDTs was undertaken in a hyperendemic area of Uganda."

Three thousand, one hundred and thirty-one cases reported to the Out Patients' Department; of these, 372 (11.8%) subjects were recruited on the basis of doctors' diagnosis of severe malaria, malaria and other complications. Six per cent (188/3131) ofthe patients were admitted. Serum samples for 320 ofthe 372 subjects were analysed for antibodies specific to MSP 1(19) by ELISA. The highest antibody responses occurred in the age group 2-5 years. Parasite prevalence was 77.9% (290 of 372 subjects) and parasite density ranged from 80 to >100000 parasites/microL blood. Fever (an average temperature of 38.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C and peak at 41 degrees C) and severe malaria were the major clinical manifestations of malaria amongst the study population. Severe malaria was found to be associated with other features such as cough, vomiting and diarrhoea."
CD008122,0,15029513,0,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues in the treatment of parasitic infections.,"Despite increases in the incidence of many parasitic infections in recent years, the number of studies designed to improve the treatment of these infections has failed to keep pace with their huge impact on public health. Unfortunately, research and development in this field is not an economically attractive proposition for the pharmaceutical industry, and this neglect is exacerbated by the fact that many parasitic diseases have negligible profiles in countries that have the funds to research them. An absence of effective vaccines means that, for the foreseeable future, chemotherapy is likely to be the mainstay of disease management. This review describes the advances gained in our understanding of the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with the aim of improving the way in which we use antiparasitic agents while at the same time highlighting those areas where there is an urgent need for further investigation. Unsurprisingly, much of our success has been in the chemotherapy of malaria, where the link between drug concentration and response is reasonably well characterised. For many other diseases, however, this link is poorly understood, in some cases because the mechanism of action of the drug has not been fully elucidated, or in other cases because a true pharmacodynamic endpoint may be unavailable. Overcoming these problems is critical if the clinician is to have the information necessary to enable optimal treatment of patients who may be severely ill and in need of immediate, life-saving attention."
CD008122,0,11304915,0,Naturally occurring plasmodia-specific circulating immune complexes in individuals of malaria endemic areas in India.,"Blood samples collected from individuals belonging to malaria endemic areas were assayed for antigen-specific circulating immune complexes in polyethylene glycol precipitates of serum by enzyme immunoassay. Sera were tested from patients with acute P. vivax and P. falciparum infections, from clinically immune individuals and also from healthy normals. Circulating immune complexes (CICs) containing immunoglobulin G and M isotypes were found to be abundant in individuals with ongoing and past infections and also in clinically immune donors. In patients with acute infection but without any past history of malaria, CICs of IgM type were found to be significantly higher. Demonstration of antigen/antibody specific CICs could be a useful indicator of active, ongoing and recent/past infection, also of the status of immune responses of individuals belonging to various endemic areas."
CD008122,0,7688429,0,Efficacy and limitations of QBC acridine orange staining as a routine diagnostic technique for malaria in developing countries.,"The recently developed QBC technique has been reported to be rapid, sensitive and specific for the detection of malaria infection. We evaluated this technique in comparison with thin and thick Giemsa stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria in acute fever and PUO cases. The technique was slightly more sensitive than thin blood film but equal to thick blood film examination. Identification of species of malaria posed some difficulties. Due to its high cost and requirement for a fluorescent microscope this technique, in spite of its speed and sensitivity, may not have the potential to be a substitute for the conventional blood film examination for the diagnosis of malaria, especially in developing countries."

CD008122,0,12803475,0,Malaria parasites and red blood cells: from anaemia to transmission.,"Malaria parasites, Plasmodium spp., invade and exploit red blood cells during their asexual expansion within the vertebrate host. The parasite has evolved a suite of adaptive mechanisms enabling optimal exploitation of the host blood cell environment, avoiding host destruction, maintaining a parasite reservoir of infection and producing sexual transmission stages to infect mosquitoes. The highly variable nature of the host blood environment, both over the course of an infection and as a result of other parasitic infections, has selected for the evolution of considerable phenotypic plasticity in the parasite's response to its environment, particularly those phenotypes concerning transmission of the parasite to mosquitoes. With the evolution of human society, human malaria disease is becoming an increasingly urban problem. This imposes different selection pressures on the parasite. The extent to which the parasite is truly plastic over the short term rather than adaptive over the long term will determine the urban epidemiology of malaria and is essential for developing appropriate control methods. Understanding the adaptive nature of malaria parasites is thus vital for anticipating the future visage of urban human malaria."
CD008122,0,11285494,0,"Malaria vectors in the municipality of Serra do Navio, State of Amapá, Amazon Region, Brazil.","We conducted a survey to determine the vectors of malaria in six localities of Serra do Navio municipality, State of Amapá, from 1990 to 1991. Malaria infection rates of 29.3%, 6.2% and 20.4% were detected by human blood smears in Colônia Agua Branca, Porto Terezinha and Arrependido, respectively. There was no malaria infection detected in Serra do Navio. Fifteen species were identified among 3,053 anopheline mosquitoes collected by human bait and 64.4% were identified as Anopheles albitarsis s.l., 16.7% An. braziliensis, 9.5% An. nuneztovari and 5.8% An. triannulatus. An. darlingi, the main vector of malaria in the Amazon region of Brazil, was scare. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a total positive rate of 0.8% (23/2876) was found for six species: fifteen An. albitarsis s.l., four An. nuneztovari, and one of each: An. braziliensis, An. triannulatus, An. oswaldoi and An. rangeli. Nine of 23 positive mosquitoes were infected with Plasmodium malariae, eight with P. vivax VK210, three with P. vivax VK247 and three with P. falciparum. Since An. albitarsis s.l. was collected feeding on humans, was present in the highest density and was positive by ELISA for malaria sporozoites, it probably plays an important role in malaria transmission in this area."
CD008122,0,15002899,0,Comparative assessment of conventional PCR with multiplex real-time PCR using SYBR Green I detection for the molecular diagnosis of imported malaria.,"For the diagnosis of imported malaria, optical or immunochromatographic methods are known to be less sensitive and less specific than PCR-based methods, which are conversely more complicated and time-consuming. An original strategy, based upon the sequential use of a multiplex competitive real-time PCR detecting Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium spp. infection, followed by, if necessary, a single real-time PCR for species identification, was therefore performed and then tested versus conventional PCR in routine conditions. Conventional PCR has been used since October 1999 in the Department of Parasitology, University Hospitals in Toulouse, as a 2nd line diagnostic method. Out of 183 patients tested, 48 were found to be harbouring a falciparum infection by conventional microscopy, 60 by conventional PCR and 60 by multiplex competitive real-time PCR. Nine further patients had a non-falciparum infection, and concordant species identifications were obtained by both conventional PCR and single real-time PCR. The major value of PCR-based methods, when compared to microscopical techniques, was to ascertain the negativity of a suspect sample. Moreover, real-time PCR allows simplification of the operating procedure, with a diagnosis being made within 2 h."
CD008122,0,10492790,0,Sampling and storage of blood and the detection of malaria parasites by polymerase chain reaction.,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is now widely used in malaria research for analysis of field samples. However, little has been reported regarding loss of sensitivity due to field methodology. Therefore, studies were carried out in relation to blood sampling (anticoagulants, culture medium, filter paper), storage (temperature, time and immediate lysis) and handling (repeated thawing and freezing). The PCR was unaffected by citrate and EDTA but partly inhibited by heparin (inhibition was reversed by heparinase at optimal concentrations). Samples collected on filter paper showed a significant 100-fold lower sensitivity (compared to control samples frozen immediately after collection) when stored at 30 degrees C and 60% humidity; and the paper quality appeared to be critical. Storage of unprocessed whole blood at 4 degrees C, 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C rarely resulted in any loss of sensitivity. Repeated thawing generally resulted in 10-fold loss of sensitivity compared to blood kept frozen until DNA extraction. The presence of antimalarial drug did not apparently affect sensitivity. We conclude that the mode of collection and storage of blood samples may influence the sensitivity of detection of malaria parasites by PCR. This may be critical in studies including individuals with low parasitaemia, mixed infections and comparison of data from different settings."
CD008122,0,18226014,0,Inhibitory properties of the antibody response to Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein in an area with unstable malaria transmission.,"The function of the Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (DBP) during the erythrocyte invasion process is critical for successful parasite growth and pathogenesis in human infections. Although DBP is the subject of intensive malaria vaccine research, investigations on the functional proprieties of anti-DBP antibodies in the human population have been limited [Infect Immun68 (2000) 3164]. In the present study, we examined the ability of sera from different populations of the Brazilian Amazon--an area of markedly unstable malaria transmission--to inhibit the erythrocyte-binding function of the DBP ligand domain (region II, DBP(II)). We found that long-term exposure to malaria in the Amazon area elicits DBP-specific antibodies that inhibit the binding of different DBP(II) variants to erythrocytes. Despite the great variability of inhibitory antibody responses observed among study participants, we observed a positive correlation between erythrocyte binding-inhibitory activity and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti-DBP antibodies. Of importance, there was a non-significant tendency towards increased levels of anti-DBP antibodies among individuals with asymptomatic P. vivax infections."
CD008122,0,19173772,1,"Rapid diagnostic tests for the home-based management of malaria, in a high-transmission area.","Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are sometimes recommended to improve the home-based management of malaria. The accuracy of an RDT for the detection of clinical malaria and the presence of malarial parasites has recently been evaluated in a high-transmission area of southern Mali. During the same study, the cost-effectiveness of a 'test-and-treat' strategy for the home-based management of malaria (based on an artemisinin-combination therapy) was compared with that of a 'treat-all' strategy. Overall, 301 patients, of all ages, each of whom had been considered a presumptive case of uncomplicated malaria by a village healthworker, were checked with a commercial RDT (Paracheck-Pf). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of this test, compared with the results of microscopy and two different definitions of clinical malaria, were then determined. The RDT was found to be 82.9% sensitive (with a 95% confidence interval of 78.0%-87.1%) and 78.9% (63.9%-89.7%) specific compared with the detection of parasites by microscopy. In the detection of clinical malaria, it was 95.2% (91.3%-97.6%) sensitive and 57.4% (48.2%-66.2%) specific compared with a general practitioner's diagnosis of the disease, and 100.0% (94.5%-100.0%) sensitive but only 30.2% (24.8%-36.2%) specific when compared against the fulfillment of the World Health Organization's (2003) research criteria for uncomplicated malaria. Among children aged 0-5 years, the cost of the 'test-and-treat' strategy, per episode, was about twice that of the 'treat-all' (U.S.$1.0. v. U.S.$0.5). In older subjects, however, the two strategies were equally costly (approximately U.S.$2/episode). In conclusion, for children aged 0-5 years in a high-transmission area of sub-Saharan Africa, use of the RDT was not cost-effective compared with the presumptive treatment of malaria with an ACT. In older patients, use of the RDT did not reduce costs. The question remains whether either of the strategies investigated can be made affordable for the affected population."

Using the same monoclonal antibody and the same sera, 6 of 10 sera (60%) from parastronglyiasis patients were positive in dot-blot ELISA, whereas with sandwich ELISA, 5 of the same patient sera (50%) were positive. The specificity in both assays was 100% using 50 sera from patients with other parasitic diseases; of these, 10 each were from patients with cysticercosis, filariasis, gnathostomiasis, malaria and toxocariasis. The control group consisted of 53 sera from normal health Thais and Malaysians. The sensitivity of the assays was, however, slightly better with dot-blot ELISA and because it is simple, quick and cost-effective, it may be a test of choice for specific diagnosis of human parastrongyliasis."
CD008122,0,16887738,0,Malaria.,Malaria is increasing worldwide due to the emergence and spread of drug resistant strains. This poses major health and economic problems for the population living in endemic areas and increases the risk of infections in travelers. The diagnosis of malaria relies on a biological proof of infection by microscopy or with a rapid test. The treatment must be initiated without delay preferably with an artemisinin containing regimen. Uncomplicated malaria can be treated with oral drugs while severe infections will be hospitalized and treated with injectables. Special attention will be given to the most susceptible groups: children and pregnant women.

Sera from 527 individuals were tested for the presence of antibodies specific for three types of plasmodial antigen: liver-stage antigen (LSA-1), blood-stage antigen (SPF 70) and circumsporozoite (CS) antigen (NANP)4. The individuals taking part in the study comprised: patients with transfusional malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum or P. vivax; non-immune migrants residing in an endemic area in Rondônia; Amazonian Indians from the states of Pará (Xingu PA) and Mato Grosso (Xingu MT); people living in a hyperendemic area in Africa (Burkina-Faso); and controls that had never been to a malaria endemic area. None of the transfusional sera displayed antibodies against sporozoite or to liver stage antigen, although 80% of the P. falciparum transfusional malaria sera contained IgG antibodies against the blood-stage peptide. A low percentage of Indians from Xingu PA and of non-immune migrants displayed antibodies against liver-stage (27% and 17%) and sporozoite (11% or d 12%) peptides, although a greater frequency of antibodies against blood-stage peptide (50% and 49%) was observed in both cases. Indians from Xingu MT exhibited a greater frequency of antibodies against liver, sporozoite and blood-stage peptides (45%, 50% and 58%). Only hyperimmune African individuals exhibited higher percentages of antibodies against liver- (64%) and blood-stage antigens (87%), contrasting with a low frequency of antibodies against the CS repeat (33%). Taken together, the present data confirm that Rondonian migrants and Indians from Xingu PA constitute populations with limited exposure and immunity to P. falciparum malaria infection and conversely, Xingu MT Indians and Africans have been more exposed to malaria infection. In conclusion this study indicates that the immune response to these malaria parasite peptides can be used to assess malaria transmission in epidemiological surveys."

CD008122,0,16156968,0,"Investigation of the kinetics of histidine-rich protein 2 and of the antibody responses to this antigen, in a group of malaria patients from India.","Although immunological tests based on the detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) from the parasites permit the rapid diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, such tests are not yet sufficiently sensitive to detect every bloodsmear-positive case. Some individuals infected with P. falciparum may appear test-negative because of the presence of anti-HRP2 antibodies in their sera. A longitudinal follow-up of HRP2 antigenaemia and antibody responses to this antigen has now been conducted in a group of 45, bloodsmear-positive malaria cases of various ages, both during acute infection with P. falciparum and after antimalarial treatment. Pre-treatment, 'day-0' samples of fingerprick blood were tested for HRP2 (in antigen-capture ELISA) and for antigen-specific IgM and IgG (in indirect ELISA). The patients were then treated, with standard doses of chloroquine, before being retested, for HRP2 and anti-HRP2 antibodies, on days 7, 15 and 28. The level of antigenaemia, which on day 0 was found to be positively correlated with parasitaemia (r = 0.741; P < 0.001), had only fallen by an insignificant amount by day 7 but showed further, significant falls between days 7 and 15 (P < 0.001) and between days 15 and 28 (P < 0.01). Although no significant relationship was observed between the blood concentrations of HRP2 and anti-HRP2 IgM or IgG on days 0 or 7, the level of HRP2 antigenaemia was found to be positively correlated with the concurrent titre of anti-HRP2 IgM on day 15 (r = 0.612; P < 0.001) and day 28 (r = 0.501; P < 0.001). The titres of HRP2-specific IgG gradually increased over the 28 days of follow-up but were not found to be significantly correlated with the decreasing levels of HRP2 antigenaemia. When the 45 day-0 samples of blood were tested for HRP2 in a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), three appeared negative, probably because of interference from the circulating, free, anti-HRP2 antibodies in the plasma. The three RDT-negative samples were significantly different from the 42 RDT-positive, having relatively low HRP2 antigenaemias (P < 0.001) and relatively high titres of anti-HRP2 IgM (P < 0.05) and IgG (P < 0.001). Control samples of blood, from four patients infected with P. vivax and five healthy, normal individuals, were considered ELISA-negative for HRP2 and anti-HRP2 IgM or IgG. It appears that, during human infection with P. falciparum, serum levels of HRP2 antigen remain elevated for at least 7 days post-treatment, despite the host's development of antigen-specific immune responses both before and after treatment."

CD008122,0,10979979,0,Synergism of multiple adhesion molecules in mediating cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to microvascular endothelial cells under flow.,"Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IRBCs) have been shown to interact with a number of endothelial adhesion molecules expressed on transfectants, on cell lines, and as immobilized purified receptor proteins under flow conditions. However, the experiments were designed in such a way that maximal numbers of adhesion molecules were provided as substratum. Whether the interactive events actually occur on microvascular endothelium, where the distribution and expression of adhesion molecules may be less, remains undetermined. In this study, the cytoadherance of IRBCs on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) as a model of human microvasculature was examined. IRBCs were observed to tether, roll, and adhere on resting HDMECs, which constitutively expressed CD36 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) at an optimal shear stress of 1 dyne/cm(2). Stimulation of HDMECs with tumor necrosis factor-alpha for 5 and 24 hours, which resulted in up-regulation of ICAM-1 and induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression, significantly increased the percentage of rolling cells that adhered without affecting the rolling flux. In contrast, P-selectin expression on HDMECs induced by oncostatin M led to an increase in both rolling flux and adhesion. Inhibition studies with receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that adhesion of IRBCs on HDMECs was largely CD36 dependent, whereas rolling could be mediated by any of the adhesion molecules studied. Collectively, these findings indicate that IRBCs interact synergistically with multiple adhesion molecules on vascular endothelium. The rolling of IRBCs may be the rate-limiting step in cytoadherance, since it can be modulated by cytokines to enhance CD36-mediated IRBC adhesion."
CD008122,0,11535306,0,A prime-boost immunisation regimen using DNA followed by recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara induces strong cellular immune responses against the Plasmodium falciparum TRAP antigen in chimpanzees.,"Two chimpanzees were vaccinated intramuscularly against malaria using plasmid DNA expressing the pre-erythrocytic antigens thrombospondin related adhesion protein (PfTRAP) and liver stage specific antigen-1 (PfLSA-1) of Plasmodium falciparum together with GM-CSF protein. A recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing PfTRAP was injected intramuscularly 6 weeks later to boost the immune response. This sequence of antigen delivery induced a specific and long-lasting T cell and antibody response to PfTRAP as detected by ELISPOT assay and ELISA. Antibody responses were detected after four DNA injections, and were boosted by injection of recombinant MVA expressing PfTRAP. Interferon-gamma secreting antigen-specific T cells were detected in both animals, but only after boosting with recombinant MVA. By screening a panel of PfTRAP-derived peptides, an epitope was identified that was recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes in one of the chimpanzees studied. T cells specific for this epitope were present in PBMCs and liver-infiltrating lymphocytes at a frequency of between 1 in 200 and 1 in 500. The high immunogenicity of this prime-boost regimen in chimpanzees supports further assessment of this delivery strategy for the induction of protection against P. falciparum malaria in humans."

Blood samples were collected from 1010 primary schoolchildren resident in 7 out of 9 districts of the UAE during October and November 1999. Plasma samples were tested for antibodies against MAP4 (DGQPAGDR)3P2P30, a multiple antigen peptide containing the repeat amino acid sequences of P. vivax circumsporozoite protein (CSP), conjugated to 2 T-helper epitopes, P2 (QYIKANSKFIGITE) and P30 (FNNFTVSFWLRVPKVSASHLE) from tetanus toxin. For confirmation of P. vivax-specific reactivity, positive samples were further tested against (AGDR)6, a synthetic peptide containing 6 copies of a protective epitope within the CSP, and against a recombinant CSP, designated as NS1(81)V20. Results indicated that 3.3% of the children were seropositive.

The children were randomized to receive high-dose intravenous or intramuscular quinine (20 mg salt/kg loading, then 10 mg salt/kg every 12 hr), or low-dose intravenous quinine (10 mg salt/kg loading, then 5 mg salt/kg every 12 hr). In the group receiving the high-dose intravenous regimen, mean high and low quinine concentrations were consistently greater than 10 and 6.5 mg/l, respectively. Peak concentrations as well as the time required to achieve them were similar in the intramuscular and high-dose intravenous groups. The low-dose intravenous quinine regimen resulted in mean peak concentrations greater than 6 mg/l and mean low concentrations greater than 3.5 mg/l. All blood concentrations exceeded the 99% in vitro inhibitory concentration (EC99) of 0.89 mg/l or less of quinine for 60 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, which were taken from children with malaria during the same period. Judged by a number of clinical criteria, the response was better in patients receiving the high-dose than the low-dose intravenous regimen. The time taken to clear parasites with both the high-dose intravenous and intramuscular regimens were significantly shorter than those obtained in the low-dose group. We have also shown for the first time that the rate of parasite clearance can be directly related to the area under the quinine concentration versus time curve. This applied to all three quinine regimens (r = 0.4252, P less than 0.02; n less than or equal to 35). Five patients, two on the low-dose regimen, two on the intramuscular regimen, and one on the high-dose regimen, developed hypoglycemia after admission, but in these cases, insulin concentrations were correspondingly low. No significant quinine toxicity was observed in any of the cases. The high-dose intravenous quinine regimen described here may be optimal for treatment of severe falciparum malaria in areas of chloroquine resistance in Africa. Our data provide no justification for reducing the dose of quinine in the treatment of severe malaria in Africa. The intramuscular regimen could provide a satisfactory alternative in areas where intravenous administration might be delayed or is impossible."

The objective here was to assess the diagnostic performance, i.e. the sensitivity and specificity, of a new malaria antibody ELISA kit in comparison to IFAT. This new ELISA kit, the ELISA malaria antibody test (DiaMed), uses a combination of crude soluble Plasmodium falciparum extract and recombinant Plasmodium vivax antigens."
CD008122,0,3516466,0,Characterization of the humoral immune response in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. III. Factors influencing the coexpression of antibody isotypes (IgM and IgG-1 to 4).,"Isotypes (IgM and IgG-1 to 4) of anti-P. falciparum antibodies were investigated in sera of malarial patients or immune donors by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and two indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), one staining intra-erythrocytic parasites of all stages and the other a restricted number of parasite antigens deposited in the membrane of infected erythrocytes by invading merozoites (Perlmann & Wahlgren, 1983; Perlmann et al., 1984, Wahlgren et al., 1985a). There was no correlation in overall antibody titres between the two IFAs. Antibodies of both IgM and all four IgG isotypes were detected in both assays. With the IFA for intracellular parasites a brilliant fluorescence was obtained with antibodies of all isotypes. However IgG-2 antibodies often gave staining restricted to the surface of schizonts. The incidence and reactivity in individual sera of antibodies of the different isotypes did not relate to the immune status of the donors (acute infection or clinically immune) but related well to the degree of malarial exposure as reflected by the overall antibody titres. This, in all three assays, high titred sera frequently contained antibodies of all isotypes while low titred sera usually only contained antibodies of IgM, IgG-1 and IgG-3 isotype. On average, the overall expression of antibodies of different isotypes in individual sera appears to reflect a sequential downstream (5' to 3') activation of the corresponding Igh-C genes in P. falciparum specific B-cell clones."

To observe some entomological aspects of the malaria transmission in an urban environment, a longitudinal survey of anopheline fauna was performed in Boa Vista, Roraima, Brazil. A total of 7,263 anophelines was collected in human bait at 13 de Setembro and Caranã districts: Anopheles albitarsis sensu lato (82.8%), An. darlingi (10.3%), An. braziliensis (5.5%), An. peryassui (0.9%) and An. nuneztovari (0.5%). Nightly 12 h collections showed that An. albitarsis was actively biting throughout the night with peak activities at sunset and at midnight. An. darlingi bit during all night and did not demonstrate a defined biting peak. Highest biting indices, entomological inoculation rates and malaria cases were observed seasonally during the rainy season (April-November). Hourly collections showed host seek activity for all mosquitoes peaked during the first hour after sunset. An. darlingi showed the highest plasmodial malaria infection rate followed by An. albitarsis, An. braziliensis and An. nuneztovari (8.5%, 4.6%, 3% and 2.6%, respectively). An. albitarsis was the most frequently collected anopheline, presented the highest biting index and it was the second most frequently collected infected species infected with malaria parasites.

Whole blood specimens were collected on filter paper from patients infected with P. vivax in Mexico and Peru. Plasmodium vivax DNA was eluted from filter paper samples and the CS gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed for the presence of VK247 or VK210 DNA by oligoprobe hybridization. Sera eluted from a companion filter paper sample were screened for antibodies reactive with the predominant and variant repeat peptides by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and with sporozoites by the immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test. All 24 patients were positive by PCR and oligoprobe hybridization for either VK210 (16 of 24), VK247 (3 of 24), or both (5 of 24). Mixed infections were common (5 of 7) in Peru, but were not observed in the Mexican isolates (0 of 17). All three VK247 infections from Mexico occurred in residents of the foothills above Tapachula (P = 0.02). Of patients with smear-positive P. vivax infection, 42% (10 of 24) had detectable antibodies eluted from dried blood dots that were reactive with the CS protein by IFA or ELISA. These findings establish the widespread distribution of the P. vivax variant CS protein in the New World and indicate that dried blood filter paper samples represent a valuable source of material for the serologic and molecular analysis of plasmodial infections."
CD008122,0,16778310,0,The epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis in Bangladesh: prospects for improved control.,"The parasitic disease kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis, VL) was first described in 1824 in Jessore district, Bengal (now Bangladesh). Epidemic peaks were recorded in Bengal in the 1820s, 1860s, 1920s, and 1940s. After achieving good control of the disease during the intensive vector control efforts for malaria in the 1950s-1960s, Bangladesh experienced a VL resurgence that has lasted to the present. Surveillance data show an increasing trend in incidence since 1995. Research in recent years has demonstrated the utility of non-invasive diagnostic modalities such as the direct agglutination test and rapid tests based on the immune response to the rK39 antigen. In common with its neighbours India and Nepal, VL in Bangladesh is anthroponotic. Living in proximity to a kala-azar case is the strongest risk factor for disease, while consistent use of bed nets in the summer months and the presence of cattle are protective. Shortages of first-line antileishmanial drugs and insecticide for indoor spraying programmes have hindered VL treatment and vector control efforts. Effective control of VL will require activities to improve availability and access to diagnostic testing and antileishmanial drugs, enhanced surveillance for kala-azar, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis and VL treatment failures, and increased coverage and efficacy of vector control programmes."
CD008122,0,3445339,0,Serodiagnostic assay for visceral leishmaniasis employing monoclonal antibodies.,"A highly specific and sensitive competitive serodiagnostic assay for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was developed using species specific Leishmania donovani monoclonal antibodies. This assay, either RIA or ELISA, is based on the specific inhibition of monoclonal antibody binding to a crude parasite homogenate by serum from patients with VL. 15 monoclonal antibodies were examined. The binding of 13 antibodies was significantly inhibited by VL serum and unaffected by normal serum. 3 species-specific monoclonal antibodies, D-2, D-13 and D-14, which recognize different parasite antigens, were chosen for use in the competitive serodiagnostic assay. In 90% of the positive cases, regardless of geographic origin, VL sera inhibited monoclonal antibody binding to the parasite antigen by more than 30%. No false positive was obtained with sera from Chagas disease, lepromatous leprosy, schistosomiasis, malaria, systemic lupus erythematosus, cutaneous or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, even at serum dilutions (1:100) which cross-react strongly with Leishmania antigen in direct binding assays. Inhibition by negative control sera from areas endemic for VL and from non-endemic areas was negligible. The assay takes less than 24 h, requires minimum amounts of sera or antigen, and is easily standardized allowing interlaboratory comparison of test data. The competitive serodiagnostic assay will be especially useful in areas where Chagas disease is coendemic and the rapid diagnosis of VL by direct binding serodiagnostic assays presents a problem."

To further define the region of the Pfs230 required for transmission-blocking activity, four recombinant proteins each encoding a section of region C (Pfs230 amino acids 443-1132) were produced using the same E. coli expression system and tested for immunogenicity in mice: (i) r230/MBP.C5' encodes the first half of region C (amino acids 443-791, six cysteines); (ii) r230/MBP.CM1 encodes only cysteine motif (CM) 1 (amino acids 583-913, eight cysteines); (iii) r230/MBP.C1.6 (amino acids 453-913, eight cysteines) also includes all of CM1; and (iv) r230/MBP.C2 encodes only CM2 (amino acids 914-1268, 11 cysteines). All the recombinant proteins induced antibodies that recognized parasite-produced Pfs230, but the titre of the Pfs230 specific-antibodies generated varied, C = C1.6 = C5' > CM1 > CM2. Two recombinants, r230/MBP.C5' and r230/MBP.C1.6, induced antibody titres that were equivalent to or greater than the titre generated by r230/MBP.C. However, in contrast to r230/MBP.C, none of the recombinants induced antibodies that effectively blocked parasite infectivity to mosquitoes. This suggests that the inclusion of amino acids 914-1132 is important for the production of the transmission-blocking epitope present in region C."
CD008122,0,17456769,0,Murine cerebral malaria development is independent of toll-like receptor signaling.,"Malaria pigment hemozoin was reported to activate the innate immunity by Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 engagement. However, the role of TLR activation for the development of cerebral malaria (CM), a lethal complication of malaria infection in humans, is unknown. Using Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection in mice as a model of CM, we report here that TLR9-deficient mice are not protected from CM. To exclude the role of other members of the TLR family in PbA recognition, we infected mice deficient for single TLR1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, or -9 and their adapter proteins MyD88, TIRAP, and TRIF. In contrast to lymphotoxin alpha-deficient mice, which are resistant to CM, all TLR-deficient mice were as sensitive to fatal CM development as wild-type control mice and developed typical microvascular damage with vascular leak and hemorrhage in the brain and lung, together with comparable parasitemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia. In conclusion, the present data do not exclude the possibility that malarial molecular motifs may activate the innate immune system. However, TLR-dependent activation of innate immunity is unlikely to contribute significantly to the proinflammatory response to PbA infection and the development of fatal CM."

To address this issue, clinical, parasitologic, and hematologic responses to chloroquine or pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine treatment were assessed among very young children in Malawi (n = 153) and Kenya (n = 73). The median time to resumption of clinical symptoms in chloroquine-treated children was 13.5 days in Malawi and 9.5 days in Kenya. Children treated with pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine maintained clinical improvement and had greater increases in their hemoglobin concentration during the follow-up period than did children treated with chloroquine.

No case died or developed clinical evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Conventional indices of coagulation (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products) were usually within the normal range but reduced plasma concentrations of antithrombin III (AT-III) levels were noted in all groups, and the incidence was significantly higher in patients with severe and moderate malaria (83% and 81%) compared with the mild group (37%; P less than 0.005). Depletion of AT-III was associated with thrombocytopenia, decreased AT-III activity and elevated plasma concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (P less than 0.01), confirming activation of the coagulation cascade and increased clotting factor consumption. AT-III levels returned to normal coincident with clinical improvement. Activation of coagulation is a common and sensitive measure of disease activity in acute falciparum malaria.

CD008122,0,9713539,0,"The IgG-subclass distribution of naturally acquired antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum, in relation to malaria exposure and severity.","A critical role has been proposed for the switch from non-cytophilic IgG2 to cytophilic antibodies of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses observed in the humoral immune responses to Plasmodium falciparum of some Africans. These Africans have acquired clinically immunity naturally, after several years of exposure to holo-endemic malaria. In the present study, the possibility that life-long exposure to low levels of malarial endemicity may be associated with changes in the IgG-subclass composition of antibodies to P. falciparum was investigated in a native Amazonian community. The subjects were 138 malaria-exposed but non-infected Karitiana Indians. In a separate investigation, the concentrations of IgG-subclass antibodies in acutely ill patients with severe malaria (N = 22) were compared with those in age- and sex-matched controls who had uncomplicated malaria (N = 44). Plasma concentrations of IgG against a detergent-soluble extract of P. falciparum schizonts were measured by quantitative ELISA, using indirect standardization. Among the Karitiana, the concentrations of anti-parasite antibodies of all subclasses increased with age, and there was no correlation between age and the proportion of such antibodies which was cytophilic. The predominance of cytophilic IgG1 and non-cytophilic IgG2 antibodies in all age-groups of the Karitiana provides an example of an intermediate pattern of immune responses to P. falciparum which contrasts with those previously described in both clinically immune and non-immune populations. Although mean concentrations of cytophilic IgG1 against P. falciparum were significantly higher in the controls than in the patients with severe malaria, there were no significant differences in other IgG subclasses. Lack of exposure to malaria in the past was associated with disease severity (odds ratio = 4.75; 95% confidence interval = 1.31-17.42), and may explain, at least partially, the occurrence of defective, low-IgG1 antibody responses to P. falciparum in those subjects who had severe malaria."

It is currently managing a portfolio of around 20 projects at various stages of development. However, as in all drug R&D, some of these projects will fail. The portfolio approach helps to maximize the chances of success, but there are obvious challenges, including financial and managerial ones. Proactive management of the two vital interfaces in the drug supply chain is important for success. Upstream, basic research must be aligned with translational research in order to ensure a continuous supply of leads into the development pipeline.

However, recently several nonmicroscopic rapid diagnostic tests have been developed for situations in which reliable microscopy may not be available. This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a recently introduced ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test. This assay detects Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 antigen (PfHRP-2) for P. falciparum diagnosis and pan-malarial antigen for P. vivax diagnosis. In this study we compared the performance of ICT Malaria Pf/Pv with microscopy of Giemsa-stained blood films and with an OptiMAL test that detects Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigen. A total of 750 clinically suspected malaria patients were examined at local health centers in Kuwait. Both the antigen tests had a high degree of specificity (>98%) for detection of malaria infection. However, they were less sensitive than microscopy. Compared with microscopy the ICT Malaria PF/pf test failed to detect malaria infection in 93 (34%) of 271 malaria patients (11% of patients with P. falciparum and 37% of patients with P. vivax) and the OptiMAL test failed to detect malaria infection in 41 (15%) of 271 malaria patients (7% of patients with P. falciparum and 13% of patients with P. vivax). The sensitivities of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv and OptiMAL tests for detection of P. falciparum infection were 81 and 87%, and those for detecting P. vivax were 58 to 79%, respectively. The sensitivity of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv and OptiMAL tests decreased significantly to 23 and 44%, respectively, at parasite densities of <500/ micro l. Both of the tests also produced a number of false-positive results. Overall, the performance of the OptiMAL test was better than that of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test.

From 1994 to 1996 two open clinical trials were performed in Niger in children (2-15 years). QIR was compared with intraveinous infusion in cerebral malaria (n = 76) and with intramuscular quinine in severe malaria (n = 57). A three daily QIR administration (20 mg/kg followed by 15 mg/kg/8 h) was used in cerebral malaria; a two daily administration in severe malaria (30 mg/kg followed by 20 mg/kg/12 h). Symptomatic treatment was associated for hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, anemia and seizures. Results. In the cerebral malaria study 58 children presented a Blantyre coma score below 3. Four children in the IR group and 9 children in the infusion group died (P > 0.05). Evolution was similar in both treatment groups: temperature clearance (< 37.5 degrees C) 39.0 +/- 15.2 h and 37.1 +/- 16.5 h; return to consciousness 34.6 +/- 12.8 h and 33.0 +/- 14.1 h; decrease to 50% of the initial parasites count: 15.5 +/- 11.5 h and 13.8 +/- 10.0 h. Residual blood quinine concentrations at 48 hours were similar 7.4 +/- 3.7 mg/l and 7.2 +/- 2.9 mg/l. In the severe malaria study, the mortality was 0 and 7.6% in the QIR and IM group respectively (P > 0.005). Evolution was similar in both treatment groups: temperature clearance (< 37.5 degrees C) 38.7 +/- 22.8 h and 38.6 +/- 22.2 h; return to consciousness 26.8 +/- 13.9 h and 27.6 +/- 9.9 h for the 16 children in coma. The evolution under QIR treatment was also similar with that described with the other quinine routes. QIR allows an efficious treatment particularly when correct infusion cannot be performed. The efficacy, the simplicity and the good tolerance of QIR are of major concern to decrease the mortality of severe malaria due to delay for treatment and to decrease the side-effects due to intramuscular administrations of quinine in Africa."
CD008122,0,18800620,0,[Identification of four species of human malaria parasites by fast PCR].,"Malaria is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. Accurate identification of four species of human malaria parasite is essential for appropriate treatment. Here, we developed a simple and rapid method of identifying Plasmodium species using a fast polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Based on the previous literature, we amplified small subunit ribosomal RNA genes of four human malaria parasites. To establish a minimum detection limit, a blood sample with a known number of P. falciparum parasites (parasitemia: 3%) was diluted serially(from 0.03% to 0.000003%). We compared the detection limits between single (one-step) PCR and nested (two-step) PCR. Other clinical blood samples, which were infected with P. falciparum (parasitemia: 2.8%), P. vivax (parasitemia: 0.13%), P. ovale (parasitemia: 0.04%), respectively, were also tested by our PCR system. The PCR findings were compared to those of blood film Giemsa staining and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). The sensitivity of our method is less than one parasite in 1 microl of blood(estimated parasitemia: 0.000003%) for both single PCR and nested PCR, though an increased number of cycles (40 cycles) was required for single PCR. Using clinical samples, it was proven that amplified products by single PCR could clearly distinguish between P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale. To detect P. vivax and P. ovale, the PCR system was more sensitive than RDT. The total required time for our method was within three to four hours from DNA extraction to PCR detection. Taken together, our method is easier and faster than the previously reported PCR-based malaria parasite identification systems, and is also useful for cases in which diagnosis by Giemsa staining and RDT is difficult."
CD008122,0,9487395,0,Laboratory investigations in the diagnosis of septicaemia and malaria.,"During a three month prospective study, 229 in-patients with fever, admitted to St. Mary's Hospital, Mumias, were examined for bacterial and malarial causes of fever. Blood cultures taken from patients appeared to contain true pathogens in 51 (22%) cases. Nine different bacterial species were identified from positive blood cultures of which four predominated: Salmonella typhi (46%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), Salmonella enteritidis (12%), Salmonella typhimurium (8%). S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium isolates were mostly multi-antibiotic resistant, compared to S. typhi isolates which were relatively susceptible to the antibiotics used in the hospital. Only 70% of the S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to penicillin. Among 227 patients in whom a thick blood-film for malaria parasites and HIV serology were performed, only 25 (11%) revealed malaria parasites. HIV-1 antibodies were detected in 51 (22%) patients. Without appropriate laboratory examinations, the majority of the diagnoses would have been missed and no optimal treatment would have been administered. This may increase resistance to antimalarials and antibiotics."

Consequences for the estimation of the transmission of malaria in 1995 in Ndiop, Senegal].","An entomological study was carried out in Ndiop village, Senegal, an area of sudan-type savana, from January to December 1995, to compare the malaria inoculation rate measured by the dissection of salivary glands of anophelines and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mosquitoes were sampled by night-bite collections. Species from the Anopheles gambiae complex were identified using the polymerase chain reaction. 1292 females Culicidae were collected. 597 anophelines mosquitoes known to be malaria vectors were captured during 148 man-nights of capture. Of the 572 anophelines investigated, 14 were positive using dissection while 21 were found to be positive with ELISA. The sporozoite rates were 2.5%, 2.2% and 3.8% for An. arabiensis, An. gambiae and An. funestus, respectively. The circumsporozoite rates were 3.5%, 2.2% and 7.7% for these three species, respectively. ELISA detected 1.5 times more positive mosquitoes than dissection. These results are discussed with reference to the duration of the sporogonic cycle, the delay before CSP antigens are apparent, and the daily survival rate of Anopheles mosquitoes."
CD008122,0,19123315,0,Multiple malaria infection in a pregnant woman from Nigeria: detection by multiplex PCR.,"For the last 100 years, diagnosis of malaria has been based on examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films under the microscope. This is a time-consuming procedure which often fails to correctly diagnose the infecting species--especially when carried out by inexperienced technicians or when blood levels of parasite are low. Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for antigen detection can distinguish between Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax but cannot identify the species present in mixed infections. In the case reported here we used multiplex PCR to investigate suspected mixed infection in a pregnant woman from Nigeria. The results suggest that the method used is highly specific and can be very sensitive and that it has several advantages with respect to microscopy and RTDs."

CD008122,0,3295109,0,"Invasion of mouse erythrocytes by the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.","Plasmodium falciparum malaria merozoites require erythrocyte sialic acid for optimal invasion of human erythrocytes. Since mouse erythrocytes have the form of sialic acid found on human erythrocytes (N-acetyl neuraminic acid), mouse erythrocytes were tested for invasion in vitro. The Camp and 7G8 strains of P. falciparum invaded mouse erythrocytes at 17-45% of the invasion rate of human erythrocytes. Newly invaded mouse erythrocytes morphologically resembled parasitized human erythrocytes as shown on Giemsa-stained blood films and by electron microscopy. The rim of parasitized mouse erythrocytes contained the P. falciparum 155-kD protein, which is on the rim of ring-infected human erythrocytes. Camp but not 7G8 invaded rat erythrocytes, indicating receptor heterogeneity. These data suggest that it may be possible to adapt the asexual erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum to rodents. The development of a rodent model of P. falciparum malaria could facilitate vaccine development."
CD008122,0,12474470,0,Irrigated crop production is associated with less malaria than traditional agricultural practices in Tanzania.,"There is concern that crop irrigation that results in increased numbers of vector mosquitoes will lead to a rise in malaria in local communities. We evaluated the level of malaria experienced in 3 communities in northern Tanzania with different agricultural practices: rice irrigation, sugar-cane irrigation and traditional maize cultivation. Five cross-sectional surveys were used to measure the prevalence of infection with falciparum malaria in 1-4 years old children in each community over a period of 12 months. Active case detection was also carried out to record clinical episodes of malaria during the study period. Information on antimalarial measures was also recorded. Results from the cross-sectional surveys showed that the overall prevalence of malaria parasites was less near the rice irrigation (12.5%) and sugar-cane (16.9%) schemes than the savannah village (29.4%). There were also significantly fewer clinical episodes of malaria in the rice village (15 cases/1000 child-weeks at risk [cwar]) than either the sugar-cane (36 cases/1000 cwar) or savannah (40 cases/1000 cwar) villages. Overall, rice irrigation was associated with less malaria than alternative agricultural practices, despite the considerable numbers of vectors produced in the paddies. This finding supports other studies that indicate that irrigation in much of sub-Saharan Africa will not lead to increased malaria. Nonetheless, African governments planning irrigation projects need effective policies to encourage local communities to use personal protection measures, such as insecticide-treated bednets, and to ensure that these communities have access to effective antimalarial drugs and efficient health services."

CD008122,0,2462660,0,Rapid diagnosis of malaria by acridine orange staining of centrifuged parasites.,"A rapid diagnostic test for malaria based on acridine orange staining of centrifuged parasites in a microhaematocrit tube ('QBC' tube) was compared with the thick blood smear in 12 volunteers experimentally infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 408 residents of a malaria endemic area, and 180 hospital patients with suspected malaria. In the experimentally infected volunteers, the QBC tube test and the thick blood smear were comparable and the QBC tube could detect as few as 4 parasites/microliter blood. When used for mass screening in the field study, the test had a sensitivity of 70% for the diagnosis of malaria compared with 92% for a single thick blood smear. However, when used to diagnose malaria in hospital patients, the test detected as few as 3 parasites/microliter in 91 of 92 patients with asexual parasitaemia. For the three studies, the QBC tube was highly specific (98.4%), indicating malaria in only 8 of 487 subjects with negative blood films. The species of parasite was correctly identified in 77% of species. Processing the QBC tube was easier and much more rapid than was processing a thick blood smear, taking only 5 min for centrifugation and 5 min for examination. The QBC tube is not a substitute for the blood smear, but its speed and ease of use make it an important new tool for the diagnosis of malaria."
CD008122,0,11355555,0,Persistence of Plasmodium falciparum HRP-2 in successfully treated acute falciparum malaria.,"The potential for Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2) dipstick tests to predict antimalarial treatment failure was investigated in a prospective study in Thailand of 38 patients admitted with severe malaria and 54 hospitalized with uncomplicated P. falciparum infections. Of these, 40 had subsequent recrudescence of their infections. Overall, 89% of patients with severe malaria and 61% of patients with uncomplicated malaria had positive PfHRP-2 dipstick tests for > 2 weeks following the start of treatment. Persistence was correlated positively with admission parasite counts, PfHRP-2 intensity scores and disease severity. PfHRP-2 tests which remained positive for > 2 weeks and PfHRP-2 reactive intensity scores on admission, at day 7 and day 14 did not predict treatment failure independent of admission parasitaemia. Freezing and thawing the blood samples did not significantly affect PfHRP-2 results tested by the dipstick technique. The PfHRP-2 dipstick test provides a useful indicator of recent severe malaria, but does not predict the therapeutic response."
CD008122,0,14629768,0,Detection of malaria sporozoites by standard ELISA and VecTestTM dipstick assay in field-collected anopheline mosquitoes from a malaria endemic site in Ghana.,"We compared the VecTestTM dipstick assay for detection of Plasmodium sporozoites in Anopheles vectors of malaria with standard circumsporozoite (CS) microplate ELISA for detection of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) in Anopheles mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were collected from a malaria endemic site (Kassena Nankana district) in northern Ghana. Of 2620 randomly sampled mosquitoes tested, the standard CS-ELISA gave a sporozoite rate of 10.8% compared with 11.2% by VecTestTM, which was not statistically different (P = 0.66). Visual reading of the CS-ELISA results gave a sporozoite rate of 13.4%, which was higher than the other tests (P > 0.05). To allow a more objective evaluation of the sensitivity of the dipstick, an additional 136 known CS-ELISA-positive specimens were analysed. The prevalence of the test (including the additional samples) was 14.6% and 14.7% for CS-ELISA and dipstick, respectively (P > 0.05). The estimated prevalence by visual assessment of the CS-ELISA results was 17.5%. The relative specificity and sensitivity of the VecTestTM dipstick and visually read ELISA were estimated based on the CS-ELISA as a gold standard. The specificities of the dipstick and visual ELISA were high, 98.0% and 96.6%, respectively. However, the sensitivities of the two assays were 88.8% for VecTest and 100% for visual ELISA (P < 0.01). Concordance between VecTest and CS-ELISA was good (kappa = 0.86). Similarly, there was a good concordance between the dipstick and the visually read ELISA (kappa = 0.88). Extrapolating from PfCSP controls (titrated quantities of P. falciparum sporozoites), mean sporozoite loads of CS-ELISA-positive An. gambiae (286 +/- 28.05) and An. funestus (236 +/- 19.32) were determined (P = 0.146). The visual dipstick grades showed high correlation with sporozoite load. The more intense the dipstick colour, the higher the mean sporozoite load (+ = 108, ++ = 207, +++ = 290, r = 0.99, r2 = 1). The VecTest dipstick offers practical advantages for field workers needing rapid and accurate means of detection of sporozoites in mosquitoes."
CD008122,0,8066388,0,Treatment of malaria fever episodes among children in Malawi: results of a KAP survey.,"Caretakers of children (< 10 years of age) were questioned about management of pediatric malarial fever episodes in a nation-wide knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey conducted in Malawi. A total of 1,531 households in 30 randomly selected clusters of 51 households each were sampled and interviewed. Overall 557 caretakers reported a fever in their child in the previous 2 weeks; 43%-judged the illness as severe. Fifty-two percent of caretakers brought their febrile children to clinic. Clinic attendance was positively correlated with young age of the child (< 4 years), severe illness, and higher socioeconomic status. Seventy-four percent of clinic attenders gave their child an antimalarial; in contrast, only 42% of those not attending clinic gave an antimalarial. Optimal therapy (administration of an antimalarial promptly and at the proper dosage) was received by only 7% of febrile children. Children taken to clinic were twice as likely to receive optimal therapy as were non-attenders. Identification of critical points in the optimal therapy algorithm and characteristics of caretakers linked with sub-optimal therapy may help malaria control programs target specific groups and health education messages to improve treatment of malaria fever episodes."
CD008122,0,8552406,0,Immunogens containing sequences from antigen Pf332 induce Plasmodium falciparum-reactive antibodies which inhibit parasite growth but not cytoadherence.,"Immunogens based upon sequences from the P. falciparum asexual blood stage antigen Pf332 were assessed for their capacity to induce antibodies inhibiting parasite growth or cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes in vitro. Selection of the Pf332 sequences was based on their reactivity with the human monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 33G2 which inhibits parasite growth as well as cytoadherence in vitro. Octameric multiple antigen peptides (MAP) were assembled based upon either a trimer of the minimal epitope recognized by the MoAb, VTEEI, or a Pf332 sequence including that motif, SVTEEIAEEDK. A dimer of SVTEEIAEEDK was also expressed in Escherichia coli, genetically fused to ZZ, two IgG-binding domains of staphylococcal protein A. Rabbit antibodies elicited by the immunogens reacted with Pf332 in immunofluorescence and in ELISA with Pf332 peptides which were also recognized by MoAb 33G2. The MAP with branched (VTEEI)3 peptide induced the highest titres of P. falciparum-reactive antibodies. In contrast to MoAB 33G2, none of the polyclonal Pf332 reactive sera cross-reacted with repeat sequences of the malaria antigen Pf155/RESA. The polyclonal Pf332-reactive antibodies inhibited parasite growth efficiently but had no or very low inhibitory effect in a cytoadherence assay. Thus, while Pf332 may be an important target for parasite neutralizing antibodies its involvement in cytoadherence is unclear."
CD008122,0,8165727,0,Malaria chemosuppression during pregnancy. VI. Some epidemiological aspects of malaria in infants.,"The possible influence of maternal malaria prophylaxis on infancy malaria was assessed in 241 infants. Mothers of 91 infants (PROG-cohort), 99 infants (CQ-cohort) and 51 infants (CQ+PROG-cohort) had received prophylaxis with daily proguanil, once weekly chloroquine, and the two drug combination respectively. Blood smears of infants were examined for parasitaemia once fortnightly. Parasitaemias were treated with either amodiaquine, Fansidar, or Fansidar-quinine combination. In all cohorts, the incidence of malaria parasitaemias within 3 months of age was high (overall mean = 63%). Chloroquine released from its tissue bound form in the CQ and CQ+PROG-cohorts did not have significant chemosuppressive effects on the parasitaemias. Acknowledging that the CQ-prophylaxis group simulated the hypothetical control group, the cohorts similarity in the pattern of parasitaemias suggested that effective maternal malaria chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy did not significantly influence infancy malaria. A sharp rise in incidence around 3 months was indicative of the waning effect of passive immunity. Sole dependence on sub-optimal active immunity led to another sharp rise in incidence from 9 months onwards. The high incidence of infancy malaria parasitaemias calls for increased vigilance in their early detection and effective treatment. Social-cultural factors within the communities may constrain effective disease management."

A WHO International Collaborative study.,"A collaborative study involving several international research groups was conducted in order to test the validity and reproducibility of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) measurements in serum. 58 serum samples, nine of them spiked with recombinant human TNF, were aliquoted and distributed blindly to 11 different laboratories. 20 samples were obtained from cerebral malaria patients, 20 from septic shock patients, eight from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ten from normal blood donors. The serum samples were assayed for TNF using various immunoassays (ELISA), radioimmunoassays (RIA) and bioassays. Interassay coefficient of variance was analysed. Substantial differences were observed on terms of sensitivity and results obtained with the different commercial and in-house assays. The level of sensitivity was highest with ELISAs and bioassays. RIAs yielded the highest concentrations of TNF in the same samples as compared to those obtained by ELISAs and bioassays. These data emphasize the necessity of establishing international standards for cytokine assays in order to render the interpretation of biological and medical data more reliable."
CD008122,0,18053209,0,Intermittent preventive treatment for the prevention of malaria during pregnancy in high transmission areas.,"Malaria in pregnancy is one of the major causes of maternal morbidity and adverse birth outcomes. In high transmission areas, its prevention has recently changed, moving from a weekly or bimonthly chemoprophylaxis to intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp). IPTp consists in the administration of a single curative dose of an efficacious anti-malarial drug at least twice during pregnancy - regardless of whether the woman is infected or not. The drug is administered under supervision during antenatal care visits. Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the drug currently recommended by the WHO. While SP-IPTp seems an adequate strategy, there are many issues still to be explored to optimize it. This paper reviewed data on IPTp efficacy and discussed how to improve it. In particular, the determination of both the optimal number of doses and time of administration of the drug is essential, and this has not yet been done. As both foetal growth and deleterious effects of malaria are maximum in late pregnancy women should particularly be protected during this period. Monitoring of IPTp efficacy should be applied to all women, and not only to primi- and secondigravidae, as it has not been definitively established that multigravidae are not at risk for malaria morbidity and mortality. In HIV-positive women, there is an urgent need for specific information on drug administration patterns (need for higher doses, possible interference with sulpha-based prophylaxis of opportunistic infections). Because of the growing level of resistance of parasites to SP, alternative drugs for IPTp are urgently needed. Mefloquine is presently one of the most attractive options because of its long half life, high efficacy in sub-Saharan Africa and safety during pregnancy. Also, efforts should be made to increase IPTp coverage by improving the practices of health care workers, the motivation of women and their perception of malaria complications in pregnancy. Because IPTp is not applicable in early pregnancy, which is a period when malaria may also be deleterious for women and their offspring, there is a necessity to integrate this strategy with other preventive measures which can be applied earlier in pregnancy such as insecticide-treated nets."

Interventions of proven benefits in eliminating or alleviating adverse maternal outcomes include routine iron and folate supplementation in areas of high anemia prevalence, hemoglobin determination late in pregnancy, screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria by urine culture or dipstick, serologic screening and treatment of syphilis, obtaining a history of difficult labor in multipara or height in nullipara and external cephalic version at term. Interventions of proven benefits in eliminating or alleviating adverse newborn outcomes include routine measurement of fundal height, reduction of maternal physical strain, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis, malaria prophylaxis, adequate tetanus immunization, antenatal and perinatal Zidovudine in HIV-positive mothers and one vaginal examination during pregnancy.

However, difficulty in maintaining required technical skills and infrastructure has spurred the development of several nonmicroscopic malaria rapid diagnostic devices based on the detection of malaria parasite antigen in whole blood. The ParaSight F test is one such device. It detects the presence of Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein 2 by using an antigen-capture immunochromatographic strip format. The present study was conducted at outpatient malaria clinics in Iquitos, Peru, and Maesod, Thailand. Duplicate, blinded, expert microscopy was employed as the reference standard for evaluating device performance. Of 2,988 eligible patients, microscopy showed that 547 (18%) had P. falciparum, 658 (22%) had P. vivax, 2 (0.07%) had P. malariae, and 1,750 (59%) were negative for Plasmodium. Mixed infections (P. falciparum and P. vivax) were identified in 31 patients (1%). The overall sensitivity of ParaSight F for P. falciparum was 95%. When stratified by magnitude of parasitemia (no. of asexual parasites per microliter of whole blood), sensitivities were 83% (>0 to 500 parasites/microl), 87% (501 to 1,000/microl), 98% (1,001 to 5,000/microl), and 98% (>5,000/microl).

A total sixty consecutive cases of kala-azar admitted in all four Medicine Units of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital during the period of May 2002 to February 2003 was included here. Parasitological confirmation was done by demonstration of leishmania donovani bodies in bone marrow or splenic aspiration in all cases. A total 120 controls was taken of which sixty were asymptomatic endemic controls with no previous history of kala-azar and sixty were admitted patients suffering from diseases other than kala-azar (malaria, tuberculosis, enteric fever and chronic liver disease). ICT strip test for kala-azar was done in all cases and controls. Only 2 of the confirmed kala-azar cases were negative and the remaining 58 cases were positive for ICT strip test which gives the sensitivity of this test 96.6%. Among the controls, 118 were negative for ICT strip test and two of the asymptomatic controls were positive for this test with no clinical evidence of kala-azar. So, the estimated specificity of ICT strip test is 98.3%. The predictive value for a negative result was 98.3% and for a positive result was 96.6%. The ICT strip test is easy, quick, requires no technical facilities with higher sensitivity and specificity entails it to be the ideal test for the diagnosis of kala-azar in field level."

CD008122,0,16216106,1,Performance of the Now Malaria rapid diagnostic test with returned travellers: a 2-year retrospective study in a French teaching hospital.,"Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum remains the major life-threatening parasitic infection in the world. The number of cases in non-endemic countries continues to increase, and it is important that misdiagnosis of malaria should not occur, especially in non-immune travellers, because of the high risk of a fatal outcome. In a retrospective study of 399 sera, the Now Malaria rapid test was compared with the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) test and microbiological examination of thin blood films. Compared with the QBC test and thin blood films, the Now Malaria test had sensitivity and specificity values of 96.4% and 97%, respectively, for the detection of pure P. falciparum infection. A negative predictive value of 99.4% allows this test to be included in diagnostic strategies for patients presenting with clinical suspicion of malaria. Two false-negative results were associated with low levels of parasitaemia in the specimens. Thus, use of the Now Malaria test alone to detect P. falciparum infection in non-endemic countries could lead to misdiagnosis of malaria. This rapid diagnostic test should therefore be performed in association with another prompt traditional method such as examination of thin blood films."

Using resampling techniques, applied to several actual datasets of ELISA assay data, we consider the robustness of normal parametric methods, e.g. t tests and linear regression. Despite the skewness of the transformed data, we demonstrate that such methods are quite robust depending on the number of observations, type of analysis and severity of skewness. We also illustrate how bootstrap resampling can be used to provide a valid alternative method of analysis that can be used either for checking normal parametric analysis or as a direct method of analysis. We illustrate this combined approach by analysing real data to test for association between human serum antibodies to malaria merozoite surface proteins, MSP1 and MSP2, and resistance to clinical malaria, and confirm the protective effect of antibodies to MSP1 and demonstrated a similar protective effect for some antibodies to MSP2."

CD008122,0,18784230,0,"Challenges in routine implementation and quality control of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria--Rufiji District, Tanzania.","Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) represent an alternative to microscopy for malaria diagnosis and have shown high sensitivity and specificity in a variety of study settings. Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for quality control of RDTs provide detailed instructions on pre-field testing, but offer little guidance for quality assurance once RDTs are deployed in health facilities. From September 2006 to April 2007, we introduced a histidine-rich protein II (HRP2)-based RDT (Paracheck) for suspected malaria cases five years of age and older in nine health facilities in Rufiji District, Tanzania, to assess sensitivity and specificity of RDTs in routine use at rural health facilities. Thick blood smears were collected for all patients tested with RDTs and stained and read by laboratory personnel in each facility. Thick smears were subsequently reviewed by a reference microscopist to determine RDT sensitivity and specificity. In all nine health facilities, there were significant problems with the quality of staining and microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of RDTs were difficult to assess given the poor quality of routine blood smear staining. Mean operational sensitivity of RDTs based on reference microscopy was 64.8%, but varied greatly by health facility, range 18.8-85.9%. Sensitivity of RDTs increased with increasing parasite density. Specificity remained high at 87.8% despite relatively poor slide quality. Institution of quality control of RDTs based on poor quality blood smear staining may impede reliable measurement of sensitivity and specificity and undermine confidence in the new diagnostic. There is an urgent need for the development of alternative quality control procedures for rapid diagnostic tests that can be performed at the facility level."
CD008122,0,17037697,0,Evaluation of rK39 strip test for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in infants.,"This study estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the rK39 strip test compared with the immunofluorescent antibody test and microscopy of bone marrow aspirate smears (the gold standard) in 47 children with suspected visceral leishmaniasis. A control group of children with other diagnoses (tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, malaria or cutaneous leishmaniasis) were also tested to check false positive results. The sensitivity and specificity of the strip test were 82.4% and 100% and that of immunofluorescent antibody were 100% and 92.7%. The rK39 strip test is reliable where there is no access to laboratory facilities."

CD008122,0,9227798,1,Post treatment sensitivity studies with the ParaSight-F test for malaria diagnosis in Zimbabwe.,"The post-treatment diagnostic performance of the Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein (HRP-II) antigen detection test, ParaSight-F test, was assessed on 55 falciparum malaria cases treated with chloroquine during in vivo drug sensitivity studies. The post-treatment sensitivity of the test remained high, except for an insignificant decline on day 1. However, specificity dropped sharply by day 1, subsequently increasing linearly with time to satisfactory values by day 10. As expected, from its inverse relationship to specificity, the false positive rate was high on day 1 and decreased linearly to low level by day 10. The temporary increase in false positive rate-following treatment was due to persistent parasite antigen, rather than subpatent parasitaemia. Thus findings showed that positive readings by the test within 10 days post-treatment may occur in cured cases and will not necessarily imply treatment failure. Furthermore it will be important to take patient antimalarial history into consideration during routine usage of the test for malaria diagnosis. The trend of Youden's J-index for the ParaSight-F test showed that from 10 days post-treatment, the test was generally reliable, with positive readings indicating active infection. It was concluded that the ParaSight-F test was not only valuable at confirming malaria diagnosis on clinical cases in seasonal transmission areas, but had potential for application to detect recrudescent infections within 2 weeks of chloroquine treatment."
CD008122,0,16297164,0,The association of anti-phospholipid antibodies with parity in placental malaria.,"Anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) are autoantibodies associated with both infections and the pathogenesis of certain pregnancy complications. In the latter, but not the former, aPL are dependent on a co-factor, beta(2) glycoprotein I (beta2GPI), which can also be used as an antigen for detection of such aPL in pregnancy. A cross-sectional study was carried out on serum samples from Kumasi, Ghana, to determine the occurrence and beta2GPI-dependence of aPL in placental malaria. Anti-cardiolipin, anti-phosphatidylserine and anti-beta2GPI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed on sera from 103 HIV-non-infected gravid women. Placental malaria, both active and past infection, was diagnosed in 33/103 (32%) based on placental histology. In multiparae, beta2GPI-independent IgM antibodies to cardiolipin (P = 0.018) and phosphatidylserine (P = 0.009) were observed, which were most pronounced in past placental malaria infection. In primiparae, no association emerged between aPL and placental malaria. Trends for improved clinical parameters were identified in infected women with levels of anti-cardiolipin beyond the 99th multiple of the median for a healthy, non-malarious population. This study in placental malaria reports parity associations of beta2GPI-independent aPL profiles, and does not support a role for beta2GPI-dependent aPL. It is of significance in the context of the known parity differences in pregnancy malaria immunity."
CD008122,0,19300493,0,Severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria is associated with circulating ultra-large von Willebrand multimers and ADAMTS13 inhibition.,"Plasmodium falciparum infection results in adhesion of infected erythrocytes to blood vessel endothelium, and acute endothelial cell activation, together with sequestration of platelets and leucocytes. We have previously shown that patients with severe infection or fulminant cerebral malaria have significantly increased circulatory levels of the adhesive glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its propeptide, both of which are indices of endothelial cell activation. In this prospective study of patients from Ghana with severe (n = 20) and cerebral (n = 13) P. falciparum malaria, we demonstrate that increased plasma VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) level is associated with disproportionately increased VWF function. VWF collagen binding (VWF:CB) was significantly increased in patients with cerebral malaria and severe malaria (medians 7.6 and 7.0 IU/ml versus 1.9 IU/ml; p<0.005). This increased VWF:CB correlated with the presence of abnormal ultra-large VWF multimers in patient rather than control plasmas. Concomitant with the increase in VWF:Ag and VWF:CB was a significant persistent reduction in the activity of the VWF-specific cleaving protease ADAMTS13 (approximately 55% of normal; p<0.005). Mixing studies were performed using P. falciparum patient plasma and normal pooled plasma, in the presence or absence of exogenous recombinant ADAMTS13. These studies demonstrated that in malarial plasma, ADAMTS13 function was persistently inhibited in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect was not associated with the presence of known inhibitors of ADAMTS13 enzymatic function (interleukin-6, free haemoglobin, factor VIII or thrombospondin-1). These novel findings suggest that severe P. falciparum infection is associated with acute endothelial cell activation, abnormal circulating ULVWF multimers, and a significant reduction in plasma ADAMTS13 function which is mediated at least in part by an unidentified inhibitor."
CD008122,0,12929882,0,Cerebral malaria in children: serum and cerebrospinal fluid TNF-alpha and TGF-beta levels and their relationship to clinical outcome.,"This was a prospective study conducted at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, Kenya. Twenty-three children admitted to the hospital with cerebral (CM) and 10 children with non-cerebral malaria (NCM) were studied. The aim of the study was to establish and compare levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) in these children. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine levels were assayed using ELISA kits. In serum, TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha decreased over 5 days after admission to the hospital in both groups of patients with CM and NCM. In the CSF of cerebral cases the levels of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 were low and inversely related. Children in deeper coma had lower levels in serum of TGF-beta and higher levels of TNF-alpha than those in lighter levels of coma. The serum TNF-alpha levels in CM children were the same irrespective of the duration of illness before admission, but children with NCM who had been sick for a shorter duration before admission tended to have higher serum levels of TNF-alpha and higher levels of TGF-beta than those with a longer duration of illness before admission. In conclusion, this study shows that TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 may not be useful in predicting the outcome for CM. They may, however, be useful in detecting children at risk of developing deep coma. TNF-alpha and TGF-beta levels were inversely related both in serum and CSF."

CD008122,0,16086896,0,Malaria prophylaxis for aircrew: safety of atovaquone/proguanil in healthy volunteers under aircraft cabin pressure conditions.,"Because malaria in endemic areas presents a serious threat to the health of aircrew, optimal prevention is important. An effective and safe prophylactic antimalarial drug is needed. The combination of 250 mg atovaquone with 100 mg proguanil HCl (atovaquone/proguanil, or A/P) has shown good prophylactic efficacy and tolerance for prevention of falciparum malaria. However, medication for use by aircrew on duty is subject to approval by national and international aviation authorities, who require convincing evidence that the treatment has no negative effects on the flight performance of crews. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of detrimental effects of atovaquone/proguanil on flight-related performance and alertness in healthy subjects under conditions of aircraft cabin pressure."
CD008122,0,15678818,0,"[Anopheles mascarensis of Meillon 1947, a malaria vector in the middle west of Madagascar?].","Anopheles mascarensis has been demonstrated to be a vector of human malaria in the East coast of Madagascar. Here, we present original data obtained from 1996 to 2003 on the distribution, biology and vectorial capacity of An. mascarensis in the Middle-West of Madagascar. This species is consistently exophilic both for its trophic and resting behaviour. This accounts for the absence of clear impact of any indoor insecticide spraying. This species is mainly zoophilic, but can occasionally bite humans, which explains a low sporozoitic index (1/2218 = 0.045%). The densities of human landing mosquitoes are most of the time very low, with the exception of a peak between May and August at the beginning of the dry season. It implies that the vector's efficiency is very low but not insignificant in the Middle-West of Madagascar, a situation opposite to what is observed on the East coast. The vectorial efficiency of An. mascarensis and An. arabiensis would enable to maintain a low malarial endemicity in the Middle-West, even in the complete absence of An. funestus."
CD008122,0,11732153,0,Post-transfusion hepatitis C seroprevalence in Tanzanian children.,"In Tanzania, children with malaria-associated anaemia are frequently given blood transfusions, and donor blood is not screened for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. To determine the seroprevalence of HCV infection in Tanzanian children previously transfused with blood, 184 children (92 transfused, 92 not transfused) aged between 15 and 59 months matched for age and sex were screened for HCV antibodies by the particle agglutination test using Serodia anti-HCV (Fujirebio Inc., Japan). The overall prevalence of HCV infection was 7.1% (13/184). HCV seropositivity was 5.4% (5/92) among children with a history of blood transfusion and 8.6% (8/92) among the non-transfused. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of HCV infection between transfused and non-transfused children. None of the factors investigated, such as gender, the nutrition and HIV serostatus of the children and the marital and education status of their mothers, was associated with HCV seropositivity. Further studies are recommended to identify the factors associated with HCV infection in Tanzanian children."
CD008122,0,2405725,0,An ABC-ELISA for malaria serology in the field.,An avidin biotin peroxidase complex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ABC-ELISA) was examined for the diagnosis of malaria in a controlled area in Sudan Gezira. The titers of the ABC-ELISA coincided with those of the IFAT. The method was more sensitive than the ordinary ELISA as the final enzyme reaction was amplified through the use of the ABC system. This allowed the resulting color spots on the dried plate wells to be read clearly with the naked eye. This test can be carried out without using major electrical equipment.
CD008122,0,19376669,0,Development of a stable positive control to be used for quality assurance of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria.,"The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a simple, cheap, and stable positive control for the quality control and quality assurance (QA) of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for the diagnosis of malaria. Plasmodium falciparum in vitro culture of known parasite concentrations was dried on a protein saver card, that is, dried blood spots (DBSs). The cards were stored at temperatures ranging from 27 to 60 degrees C from 1 day up to 6 months. Antigens were subsequently eluted from the card giving final concentrations ranging from 30 000 parasites to 300 parasites/microL and tested for stability against RDT based on the antigens parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), aldolase, and histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2). HRP-2 antigens were stable throughout the whole study and yielded positive results irrespective of parasite concentration, storage duration, or temperature, although band intensity differences could be observed when high parasites were compared with low parasite densities. Aldolase was able to generate positive signals for up to 4 weeks irrespective of the storage conditions. Thereafter, intensities decreased proportionally to increasing temperature and storage duration. Thirty thousand parasites per liter could give a signal up to 16 weeks when stored at a temperature of maximum 45 degrees C. However, densities of 300 parasites/microL were not able to generate a signal during the study. pLDH, the least stable of the 3 antigens, was not able to generate a signal after 1 week of storage. The DBS method yields a very stable positive control for quality control and QA of RDTs based on HRP-2. RDTs based on aldolase may also benefit from this method although to a lesser extent because that particular antigen is less stable in the DBS system."
CD008122,0,2050510,0,Malaria in Israel: the Ethiopian connection.,"Over 2,000 cases of imported malaria were diagnosed in Israel in the last decade, the vast majority in immigrants from Ethiopia, making malaria a continuing public health problem of significance. In 1988, more than one- fifth of imported cases were caused by chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Since the Anopheles vector is still present in many areas of the country, it is necessary to detect and treat all cases quickly and effectively and to strengthen anti-malaria vector activities if local transmission is to be prevented. Despite massive and continuous importation of the disease, the Ministry of Health has had substantial success in the area of malaria control, through administration of presumptive treatment to Ethiopian immigrants, rapid diagnosis of imported cases and strict vector control."
CD008122,0,15623512,0,"Induction of proinflammatory responses in macrophages by the glycosylphosphatidylinositols of Plasmodium falciparum: cell signaling receptors, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) structural requirement, and regulation of GPI activity.","The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors of Plasmodium falciparum have been proposed to be the major factors that contribute to malaria pathogenesis through their ability to induce proinflammatory responses. In this study we identified the receptors for P. falciparum GPI-induced cell signaling that leads to proinflammatory responses and studied the GPI structure-activity relationship. The data show that GPI signaling is mediated mainly through recognition by TLR2 and to a lesser extent by TLR4. The activity of sn-2-lyso-GPIs is comparable with that of the intact GPIs, whereas the activity of Man(3)-GPIs is about 80% that of the intact GPIs. The GPIs with three (intact GPIs and Man(3)-GPIs) and two fatty acids (sn-2-lyso-GPIs) appear to differ considerably in the requirement of the auxiliary receptor, TLR1 or TLR6, for recognition by TLR2. The former are preferentially recognized by TLR2/TLR1, whereas the latter are favored by TLR2/TLR6. However, the signaling pathways initiated by all three GPI types are similar, involving the MyD88-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 and NF-kappaB-signaling pathways. The signaling molecules of these pathways differentially contribute to the production of various cytokines and nitric oxide (Zhu, J., Krishnegowda, G., and Gowda, D. C. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 8617-8627). Our data also show that GPIs are degraded by the macrophage surface phospholipases predominantly into inactive species, indicating that the host can regulate GPI activity at least in part by this mechanism. These results imply that macrophage surface phospholipases play important roles in the GPI-induced innate immune responses and malaria pathogenesis."

The results of blood malaria parasites examination using an immunochromatography test were compared with thick blood film (TBF) examination. It was also evaluated the performance of this test storaged at three different temperatures (25 degree C, 30 degree C, and 37 degree C) for 24 hours before use. Overall sensitivity of ICT Pf/Pv was 61.8% with a specificity of 100%, positive and negative predictive value of 100% and 71.8%, respectively and accuracy of 80.6%.

CD008122,0,17150235,0,Evaluation of a real-time PCR assay for malaria diagnosis in patients from Vietnam and in returned travellers.,"Real-time PCR diagnosis of malaria has advantages over traditional microscopic methods, especially when parasitaemia is low and when dealing with mixed infections. We have developed a new real-time PCR with specific genes in each Plasmodium species present only in one copy to identify the four pathogenic Plasmodium spp. for humans. The sensitivity was less than 25 parasites/microl. No cross-hybridisation was observed with human DNA or among the four Plasmodium spp. Using LightCycler PCR and conventional microscopy, we compared the diagnosis of malaria in patients from Vietnam and in returned European travellers with suspicion of malaria. In patients from Vietnam with suspicion of malaria, one mixed infection was observed by PCR only; the remaining data (54 of 55 patients) correlated with microscopy. In 79 patients without symptoms, low parasitaemia was detected in 7 samples by microscopy and in 16 samples by PCR. In returned travellers, PCR results were correlated with microscopy for all four species in 48 of 56 samples. The eight discrepant results were resolved in favour of real-time PCR diagnosis. This new real-time PCR is a rapid, accurate and efficient method for malaria diagnosis in returned travellers as well as for epidemiological studies or antimalarial efficiency trials in the field."
CD008122,0,11411942,1,Evaluation of rapid immunocapture assays for diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax in Korea.,"The rapid immunocapture assays, OptiMal and ICT, were evaluated from 87 individuals for the diagnosis of malaria infections directly from whole blood. A total of 87 individuals was examined for malaria parasites by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears, and 65 cases were positive for Plasmodium vivax by microscopy. Correspondingly, the OptiMal test identified malaria infection in 45 cases (69.2%) of microscopy positive cases. Of these, two cases were misinterpreted as Plasmodium falciparum, whereas ICT detected P. vivax infection in 29 (44.6%) patients. We would like to propose that rapid immuno capture assays are an easy method that can serve as a useful tool in addition to microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria, but sensitivity is not yet satisfactory for diagnosis of P. vivax in Korea."

Both are located in the Vale do Ribeira in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. In this study, 318 subjects from both areas had their blood analyzed for the presence of malaria parasites by thin and thick blood smears. One hundred and sixty-three (51.2%) of the subjects were from Intervales State Park and 155 (48.7%) were from PETAR. We analyzed all the samples by indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) to detect antibodies against asexual forms of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae and enzyme immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the presence of antibodies against circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) from P. vivax VK210, human P. vivax-like/Plasmodium simiovale, P. vivax VK247 and Plasmodium brasilianum/P. malariae. The presence of Plasmodium species was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eighteen of the subjects analyzed had positive IFA results for IgM against P. malariae antigens, and three others were positive for P. vivax antigens. Positivity of IgG antibodies against P. vivax detected by IFA was high in samples from both Intervales State Park and PETAR (32.0% and 49.0%, respectively), while positivity for P. malariae was lower (16.0% and 19.3% in Intervales State Park and PETAR, respectively). ELISA tests showed a higher prevalence of antibodies against P. vivax VK210 (35.0%) in samples from Intervales State Park and against human P. vivax-like (29.7%) in samples from PETAR. PCR reactions revealed the presence of parasites in several of the samples analyzed. In Intervales State Park, one subject was infected by P. malariae and two by Plasmodium falciparum, while in PETAR, one subject was positive for P. falciparum and three for both P. falciparum and P. vivax parasites. The areas where these parks are located belong to the Atlantic Forest habitat, and inhabitants frequently, see monkeys.

Some Sudanese adults produced IgM antibodies against all three types of phospholipids (PL) during an acute Plasmodium falciparum infection. The anti-PL antibody titre returned to preinfection levels in most of the donors 30 days after the disease episode. IgG titres against PI, PC and CL were low. In Gambian children with malaria, IgM antibody titres against PI and PC were significantly higher in those with severe malaria than in those with mild malaria. These results show that a proportion of malaria patients produce anti-PL antibodies during infection and that titres of these antibodies are associated with the severity of disease."

It is established by using traditional smear or method like dipstick antigen captures assay which is simpler, accurate and doesn't require expertise. Next step is to look for signs and symptoms, which help cases of severe malaria should be admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) and antimalarial chemotherapy should be started through parenteral route. Complications like coma, anemia, renal failure, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation are not very uncommon. These complications should be anticipated and treated in time.

GDH (NADP+) thermal stability was demonstrated in a high heat resistance assay. The immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that anti-culture (P. falciparum) supernatant serum and anti-GDH (NADP+) of Proteus spp. recognized epitopes in Venezuelan isolates, and Colombian and Brasilian malarial strains.

Indeed, a conserved and a variant PvMSP-1 gene segments have been amplified from total genomic parasite DNA obtained from isolates representing seven countries and three continents. Interestingly, the variant PvMSP-1 gene segment contains two highly conserved parental allele forms capable of limited genetic exchange at the sexual stage in the mosquito vector. This variant PvMSP-1 gene segment was amplified from 18 Colombian isolates to try to determine whether the same two parental allele forms were also present in this geographical area. Southern blot and DNA sequencing analyses confirmed their existence among the Colombian isolates. Moreover, expression of these two allele forms as recombinant proteins allowed us to demonstrate for the first time that this PvMSP-1 gene segment codes for amino acid sequences that are exposed on the surface of P. vivax schizonts and that are immunogenic in natural infections."
CD008122,0,3021967,0,"Seroepidemiological study on kala-azar in Baringo District, Kenya.","This paper reports on 164 cases of kala-azar observed in the Baringo District of Kenya between February 1981 and February 1983. All were confirmed serologically by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and all but 20 by parasitological examination as well. Following the standard treatment with a 30 day course of sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) two non-responders and four relapses were observed. Children between 2 and 15 years old were found to be the most affected age group; male patients predominated slightly at 57%. All cases occurred in the semi-arid and arid parts of the district below 1500 m, where pastoralism predominates. Besides scattered cases, certain kala-azar foci could be identified. Two of these--Endao with 49 households, 228 inhabitants and 13 cases of kala-azar, and Koriema with 22 households, 93 inhabitants and 11 cases--were subject to a house to house survey. People were examined physically, their weight and height recorded and fingerprick blood collected on blotting paper for later serological testing. Each household was mapped and the relevant environmental factors recorded. A positive correlation could be demonstrated between kala-azar cases and the vicinity of their homesteads to seasonal rivers and also between kala-azar cases and people living in timber houses, rather than mud and wattle houses. Eroded termite hills were not found to be of epidemiological importance. No satisfying explanation could be found for the striking temporal and local clustering of cases. The homestead was identified as an important site of transmission with optimum conditions for transmission occurring during supper in the evening. Based on spleen rates, Endao was classified as hyperendemic for malaria and Koriema as mesoendemic. Diagnostic ELISA values above 0.2 were observed in all cases of active kala-azar. However, ELISA values above 0.04, taken as the borderline non-specific reaction, could be found in about half of the study areas population. Therefore we conclude that asymptomatic infection must be common. Observations demonstrated that spontaneous recovery may follow clinical illness and visceralization of the parasite. Comparison of parasitological and serological data suggest that this may be expected in more than 15% of cases."
CD008122,0,9231188,0,Transmission and control of vivax malaria in Afghan refugee settlements in Pakistan.,"Regular biting collections were conducted in 1993-1994 to investigate seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of anophelines in Afghan refugee villages in north-western Pakistan. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to test heads-plus-thoraces for the presence of malaria sporozoites. Anophelines giving positive results for Plasmodium vivax were captured in every month except January. Nine species were positive. Biting rates showed a marked increase in May, after the spring rains, and thus spring transmission of vivax malaria seems certain. However, transmission of vivax malaria reached its peak only after the monsoon in July. To determine the optimal time to control vivax malaria by indoor spraying with residual insecticide, spray campaigns were conducted in either spring or summer in 14 refugee villages. Villages sprayed in July 1994 showed a mean reduction in annual incidence of 62% (95% confidence interval [CI] +/-6%) relative to the previous year, whereas villages sprayed in April 1994 showed only a 15% reduction (95% CI +/- 32%). Parasite prevalence surveys conducted in April and October 1994 confirmed the greater efficacy of spray campaigns waged in July. The insecticide malathion proved as effective as the pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin, even though several species of anopheline were resistant to malathion."
CD008122,0,9366566,0,Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and CD36 synergize to mediate adherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to cultured human microvascular endothelial cells.,"We have compared the adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and have assessed the relative roles of the receptors CD36 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). HUVEC (a cell line that expresses high levels of ICAM-1 but no CD36) mediate low levels of adhesion, whereas HDMEC (which constitutively express CD36) mediate high levels of adhesion even before ICAM-1 induction ICAM-1 expression leads to yet greater levels of adhesion, which are inhibited both by anti-ICAM-1 and CD36 mAbs, despite no increase in the expression of CD36. The results indicate the presence of a substantial population of infected cells that require the presence of both receptors to establish adhesion. Synergy between these receptors could be demonstrated using a number of parasite lines, but it could not be predicted from the binding of these same parasite lines to purified ICAM-1 and CD36. This phenomenon could not be reproduced using either purified receptors presented on plastic, or formalin-fixed HDMEC, suggesting that receptor mobility is important. This is the first study to demonstrate receptor synergy in malaria cytoadherence to human endothelial cells, a phenomenon necessary for parasite survival and associated with disease severity."
CD008122,0,12039673,0,Antigenuria in visceral leishmaniasis: detection and partial characterisation of a carbohydrate antigen.,"The detection of antigen in the urine is increasingly being used for diagnosis of parasitic infections. A urinary antigen has recently been demonstrated in visceral leishmaniasis (VL), using a latex agglutination test. The results of our study show that the detected antigen is: heat-stable, precipitates with acetone and ethanol but not TCA, is sensitive to periodate and acid hydrolysis but not to pronase E, lipase, or neuraminidase. The antigen is a low molecular weight glycoconjugate that can be extracted by phenol-water, partitions into the aqueous phase when extracted with Triton X-114 or chloroform/methanol, and can be labelled by biotin hydrazide. Since this urinary antigen cannot be characterised by conventional SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, we used an affinity transfer blotting system in which antigens were captured onto nitro-cellulose paper previously coated with a specific antibody. Using this system a low molecular weight antigen (LMWA) spanning an area of the nitro-cellulose membrane corresponding to molecular weight of 5-20 kDa was detected in the urine of VL patients (from Nepal, Sudan, Brazil, Yemen and Spain) and of experimentally infected animals. No LMWA was detected in the urine of patients with malaria, schistosomiasis, or other nonparasitic diseases including typhoid and brucellosis. Immunoprecipitation, using antibody-coated latex, followed by immunoblotting showed that the LMWA is the target antigen in the previously described latex agglutination test ('KATEX'). The antigen is detectable in both the promastigote and amastigote stages of the parasite. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Leishmania glycoconjugates strongly react with this molecule. These results suggest that the detected antigen is highly specific and diagnostic for VL."
CD008122,0,10811731,0,Functional state of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump in Plasmodium falciparum-infected human red blood cells.,"The active Ca2+ transport properties of malaria-infected, intact red blood cells are unknown. We report here the first direct measurements of Ca2+ pump activity in human red cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum, at the mature, late trophozoite stage. Ca2+ pump activity was measured by the Co2+-exposure method adapted for use in low-K+ media, optimal for parasitised cells. This required a preliminary study in normal, uninfected red cells of the effects of cell volume, membrane potential and external Na+/K+ concentrations on Ca2+ pump performance. Pump-mediated Ca2+ extrusion in normal red cells was only slightly lower in low-K+ media relative to high-K+ media despite the large differences in membrane potential predicted by the Lew-Bookchin red cell model. The effect was prevented by clotrimazole, an inhibitor of the Ca2+-sensitive K+ (KCa) channel, suggesting that it was due to minor cell dehydration. The Ca2+-saturated Ca2+ extrusion rate through the Ca2+ pump (Vmax) of parasitised red cells was marginally inhibited (2-27 %) relative to that of both uninfected red cells from the malaria-infected culture (cohorts), and uninfected red cells from the same donor kept under identical conditions (co-culture). Thus, Ca2+ pump function is largely conserved in parasitised cells up to the mature, late trophozoite stage. A high proportion of the ionophore-induced Ca2+ load in parasitised red cells is taken up by cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffers within the parasite. Following pump-mediated Ca2+ removal from the host, there remained a large residual Ca2+ pool within the parasite which slowly leaked to the host cell, from which it was pumped out."
CD008122,0,8576287,0,Quantum pharmacological analysis of structure-activity relationships for mefloquine antimalarial drugs using optimal transformations.,Optimal nonlinear transformations provided by alternating conditional expectations (ACE) method are used to study the relationship between electronic structure and antimalarial activity of mefloquine and its substituted derivatives. The electronic structure of these molecules is featured by atomic net charges evaluated on the basis of CNDO/2 molecular orbital calculations. A comparison to multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS) method is also included. The results show that ACE can be a useful and well-suited technique for establishing QSAR and predicting the pharmacological activity of compounds.
CD008122,0,17536875,0,Safety and toxicity of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine: implications for malaria prevention in pregnancy using intermittent preventive treatment.,"Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy is strongly associated with maternal anaemia and low birth weight, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) has been one of the most effective approaches to reduce the burden of malaria during pregnancy in Africa. IPTp-SP is based on administering >or=2 treatment doses of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine to pregnant women at predefined intervals after quickening (around 18-20 weeks). Randomised, controlled trials have demonstrated decreased rates of maternal anaemia and low birth weight with this approach. The WHO currently recommends IPTp-SP in malaria-endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. However, implementation has been suboptimal in part because of concerns of potential drug toxicities. This review evaluates the toxicity data of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions, teratogenicity and alterations in bilirubin metabolism. Weekly sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine prophylaxis is associated with rare but potentially fatal cutaneous reactions. Fortunately, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine use in IPTp programmes in Africa, with 2-4 treatment doses over 6 months, has been well tolerated in multiple IPTp trials. However, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine should not be administered concurrently with cotrimoxazole given their redundant mechanisms of action and synergistic worsening of adverse drug reactions. Therefore, HIV-infected pregnant women in malaria endemic areas who are already receiving cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should not also receive IPTp-SP. Although folate antagonist use in the first trimester is associated with neural tube defects, large case-control studies have demonstrated that sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine administered as IPTp (exclusively in the second and third trimesters and after organogenesis) does not result in an increased risk of teratogenesis. Folic acid supplementation is recommended for all pregnant women to reduce the rate of congenital anomalies but high doses of folic acid (5 mg/day) may interfere with the antimalarial efficacy of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. However, the recommended standard dose of folic acid supplementation (0.4 mg/day) does not affect antimalarial efficacy and may provide the optimal balance to prevent neural tube defects and maintain the effectiveness of IPTp-SP. No clinical association between sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine use and kernicterus has been reported despite the extensive use of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and related compounds to treat maternal malaria and congenital toxoplasmosis in near-term pregnant women and newborns. Although few drugs in pregnancy can be considered completely safe, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine - when delivered as IPTp - has a favourable safety profile. Improved pharmacovigilance programmes throughout Africa are now needed to confirm its safety as access to IPTp-SP increases. Given the documented benefits of IPTp-SP in malaria endemic areas of Africa, access to this treatment for pregnant women should continue to expand."
CD008122,0,12916786,0,Performance of rapid malaria Pf antigen test for the diagnosis of malaria and false-reactivity with autoantibodies.,"Recently introduced rapid nonmicroscopic immunocapture assays for the diagnosis of malaria infection are being evaluated for their sensitivity and specificity in various epidemiological settings. A Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2)-based assay (ICT malaria Pf assay) was evaluated for its performance and compared to that of Giemsa-stained thick blood film microscopy. Of the 515 patients tested, 163 were positive for malaria parasites on thick blood film microscopy: 87 were infected with P. vivax; 63 with P. falciparum; 1 with P. malariae; and 12 with both P. falciparum and P. vivax. The ICT assay detected 53 P. falciparum infections and, as expected, failed to detect all but one case of P. vivax. Three cases of mixed infections were also not detected by this assay. The performance of the ICT assay in diagnosing P. falciparum infection was comparable to that of microscopy. The sensitivity of the ICT assay was 82% and the specificity 99.0%. The ICT assay also detected 4 false-positive cases. These patients reported treatment with chloroquine in the previous 2-5 weeks. The specificity of the assay was evaluated in different groups of patients, who had tested negative for malaria infection by microscopy. These patients were selected from different disease groups: rheumatoid arthritis; hepatitis C; toxoplasmosis; schistosomiasis; and hydatid disease. Of the 225 patients studied, 133 were positive for rheumatoid factor. Thirty-five (26%) of the 133 patients had false positive-reactions with the ICT assay, while only four had false positive-reactions with the OptiMAL test. After the rheumatoid factor was absorbed 33 of the 35 false-positive specimens were negative when retested with the ICT assay. Our study shows that the PfHRP-2-based ICT assay gave a false positive-reaction in 26% of the patients who had rheumatoid factors, but were negative for malaria by microscopy. We conclude that new rapid nonmicroscopic methods for the diagnosis of malaria that complement or support blood film microscopy would be of great use in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with malaria and also in epidemiological studies."
CD008122,0,10697897,0,"Thrombospondin related adhesive protein (TRAP), a potential malaria vaccine candidate.","We have investigated whether naturally induced immunity to Plasmodium falciparum thrombospondin related adhesive protein contributes to protection against malaria in humans. We have carried out a case control study in children living in an endemic region of West Africa to reveal associations between PfTRAP seroprevalence and the risk of cerebral malaria. Sera collected from the case and control groups were analysed by ELISA to compare their serum reactivity against PfTRAP, the circumsporozoite protein and the merozoite surface protein 1. Children with uncomplicated malaria had a significantly higher PfTRAP seroprevalence when compared to children with cerebral malaria. The risk of developing cerebral malaria appeared to depend on the reciprocal relationship between sporozoite inoculation rates and humoral immunity against PfTRAP. Our results suggest that naturally induced humoral immunity against PfTRAP contributes to the development of protection against severe malaria. Experimentally induced immunity against TRAP in different rodent models has consistently proven to elicit a high degree of protection against malaria. This together with the functional properties of TRAP and data describing CD4 and CD8 epitopes for PfTRAP indicate that this molecule could increase the protective efficiency of available sporozoite malaria vaccines."

CD008122,0,16377036,0,Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Escherichia coli expressed Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1(42) using human compatible adjuvants.,"The C-terminal 42-kDa fragment of the merozoite surface protein-1 of Plasmodium falciparum (PfMSP-1(42)) was expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. We tested the immunogenicity of recombinant PfMSP-1(42) in three clinically acceptable adjuvants (Montanide ISA 720, alum and MF59) in mice and in rabbits. High antibody responses were obtained with two adjuvant formulations with IgGl being the predominant immunoglobulin isotype. Significant T-cell proliferation responses were also observed. Competitive enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) showed the presence of both invasion and processing inhibitory antibodies in sera obtained from the immunized rabbits. Passive immunizations of mice with anti-PfMSP-1(42) IgG purified from the rabbit-sera were found to be protective against a parasite challenge with P. berghei/P. falciparum chimeric line (Pb-PfM19) that expresses Plasmodium falciparum MSP-1(19). These findings may be useful for the development of a malaria vaccine based on Plasmodium falciparum MSP-1(42)."
CD008122,0,17587350,0,Fc gamma receptor IIa (CD32) polymorphism and antibody responses to asexual blood-stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Sudanese patients.,"In a prospective clinical study in New Halfa Teaching Hospital, the possible association between FcgammaRIIa-R/H131 polymorphism and anti-malarial antibody responses with clinical outcome of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among Sudanese patients was investigated. A total of 256 individuals were consecutively enrolled, comprising 115 patients with severe malaria, 85 with mild malaria and 56 malaria-free controls. Genotyping of FcgammaRIIa-R/H131 dimorphism was performed using gene-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with allele-specific restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR product. The antibody responses to asexual blood-stage antigens were assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The frequency of the FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 genotype was significantly higher in those with severe malaria when compared with patients with mild malaria, while the FcgammaRIIa-H/H131 genotype showed a significant association with mild malaria. A reduced risk of severe malaria with IgG3 antibodies in combination with the H/H131 genotype was observed. Furthermore, low levels of IgG2 antibodies reactive with the Pf332-C231 antigen were also associated with lower risk of severe malaria in individuals carrying the H131 allele. The levels of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies were statistically significantly higher in the mild malaria patients when compared with the severe malaria patients. Taken together, our study revealed that the FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 genotype is associated with the development of severe malaria, while the H/H131 genotype is more likely to be associated with mild malaria. Our results also revealed that the natural acquisition of immunity against clinical malaria appeared to be more associated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, signifying their roles in parasite-neutralizing immune mechanisms."

CD008122,0,18505434,0,Differential patterns of endothelial and leucocyte activation in 'typhus-like' illnesses in Laos and Thailand.,"Scrub typhus is responsible for a large proportion of undifferentiated fevers in south-east Asia. The cellular tropism and pathophysiology of the causative agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi, remain poorly understood. We measured endothelial and leucocyte activation by soluble cell adhesion molecule enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in 242 Lao and Thai patients with scrub or murine typhus, leptospirosis, dengue, typhoid and uncomplicated falciparum malaria on admission to hospital. Soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) levels were lowest in dengue, sL-selectin highest in scrub typhus with a high sE-selectin to sL-selectin ratio in leptospirosis patients. In scrub typhus patients elevated sL-selectin levels correlated with the duration of skin rash (P = 0.03) and the presence of eschar (P = 0.03), elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (P = 0.007), elevated lymphocyte (P = 0.007) and neutrophil counts (P = 0.015) and elevated levels of sE-selectin correlated with the duration of illness before admission (P = 0.03), the presence of lymphadenopathy (P = 0.033) and eschar (P = 0.03), elevated WBC (P = 0.005) and neutrophil counts (P = 0.0003). In comparison, soluble selectin levels in murine typhus patients correlated only with elevated WBC counts (P = 0.03 for sE-selectin and sL-selectin). Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 levels were not associated significantly with any clinical parameters in scrub or murine typhus patients. The data presented suggest mononuclear cell activation in scrub typhus. As adhesion molecules direct leucocyte migration and induce inflammatory and immune responses, this may represent O. tsutsugamushi tropism during early dissemination, or local immune activation within the eschar."
CD008122,0,12358891,0,Thrombocytopenia in patients with malaria: automated analysis of optical platelet counts and platelet clumps with the Cell Dyn CD4000 analyser.,"Platelet counts and automated detection of platelet clumps were evaluated by optical analysis with the Abbott CD4000 analyser (Abbott Diagnostics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in this South African study of 828 samples referred for malaria investigations. Based on microscopy (Micro) and rapid tests (RT) for HRP2 protein and parasite-associated LDH, malaria negative samples (n = 417) were defined as Micro-, RT-. Convalescent cases (n = 64) were Micro-, RT+ and had a recent record of positive microscopy. Malaria positive cases were subdivided into Micro+ (n = 315) and Micro-, RT+, PCR+ (polymerase chain reaction) (n = 32) subgroups. The mean platelet count for Micro+ cases (89.7 x 10(9)/l) was significantly lower than both the malaria negative (mean 212.6 x 10(9)/l) and convalescent malaria (mean 152.8 x 10(9)/l) groups; 89% of microscopy positive cases were thrombocytopenic (< 150 x 10(9)/l) and 30% had severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 10(9)/l). For comparison, 32% of the 417 malaria negative samples were thrombocytopenic and 6% of these were severe. Two thirds of samples with parasitaemia above 10% had platelet counts of < 50 x 10(9)/l while the counts were largely independent of parasite numbers when the parasitaemia was below 10%. Thirty percent of samples with microscopically detectable parasites had a PltClmp flag compared to 13% of the malaria negative group but, when the actual platelet count was taken into account, it became apparent that appearance of the flag was primarily associated with thrombocytopenia per se rather than malaria status. In most samples with a PltClmp flag, the CD4000 optical platelet clump 'signature' was indicative of small platelet aggregates and giant platelets. Morphological examination confirmed the presence of varying numbers of small platelet aggregates (3-12 individual platelets), often together with increased giant platelets, in many samples with a PltClmp flag. The observations suggest that while patients with malaria may be predisposed to the development of thrombocytopenia, a reduced platelet count in some patients may also be due in part to pseudo-thrombocytopenia."
CD008122,0,9164601,0,Fine epitope specificity of antibodies to region II of the Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite protein correlates with ability to bind recombinant protein and sporozoites.,"Recent work has suggested that important B- and T-cell epitopes on the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium vivax lie external to the major repeat regions of the protein. We have studied two naturally exposed human populations (Caucasian and Papua New Guineans) and determined the antibody response to yeast-derived recombinant CSPs, overlapping synthetic peptides spanning amino acids 76 348 of the Belem P. vivax CSP and overlapping peptides representing the variant repeats of the VK247 strain of P. vivax. We have demonstrated that the P. vivax CSP-specific antibody response is directed towards areas within the repeat region as well as areas external to this; but the dominant epitopes recognized by the two populations studied, were distinct. One epitope, lying external to the repeats and recognized by both populations, partially overlaps an area of the protein referred to as region II-plus. Sera from malaria-exposed Papua New Guineans and Thais contained antibodies to this epitope (V22, single letter amino acid sequence TCGVGVRVRRRVNAANKKPE) which were capable of recognizing sporozoites, as determined by quantitative inhibition IFA. Seventeen percent of PNG sera had antibodies to this peptide compared with 33% who had antibodies to the central repeats of the protein. Immunization of mice with recombinant CSP did not induce antibodies to V22. However, immunization with overlapping peptide epitopes representing this region (V21 or V22) induced specific antibodies but only two sera recognized both V21 and V22 and, by inference, the overlapping peptide sequence (TCGVGVRVRR). Antibodies in these two sera could bind recombinant CSP in ELISA; however, in contrast, nine sera which recognized either V21 or V22 alone did not bind CSP. Only one of two sera containing antibodies recognizing CSP stained P. vivax sporozoites. This serum also recognized an epitope dependent upon two amino acids aminoterminal to V22. These data suggest that the fine specificity of antibodies is a critical determinant for binding to both recCSP and sporozoites."
CD008122,0,10697886,0,Control of epidemic malaria on the highlands of Madagascar.,"The Malagashy national malaria control programme ('Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme', PNLP) has been developing, since 1996, an epidemiological early warning system for malaria epidemics in the Central Highlands with the support of the Italian Development Cooperation. The system is based on the monitoring of malaria morbidity (clinical diagnosis) in 536 peripheral health centres (CSB) of the Highlands. The intervention area corresponds to 27 districts of the Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa provinces (4.7 million inhabitants) and spans around 100,000 square km. For each CSB a monthly warning threshold, defined as the 1993-1996 monthly mean number of malaria cases plus two standard deviations, was established. Three levels of epidemic alert have been defined according to the number of times the cases of presumptive malaria surpassed the threshold and according to the reported presence of severe malaria cases. The surveillance system relies also on the monitoring, in district hospitals of the Highlands, of the Plasmodium falciparum infection rate among clinically diagnosed malaria cases. A total of 185,589 presumptive malaria cases, corresponding to a 42/1000 malaria incidence, were recorded in 1997 by the surveillance system. During the same year 184 alerts of 2nd degree were reported. During 1998 173,632 presumptive malaria cases corresponding to a 38/1000 incidence were reported and 207 alerts of 2nd degree were detected; 75 of these alerts were investigated with ad hoc surveys and 3 initial malaria epidemics identified and controlled. Out of 6884 presumptive malaria cases diagnosed in the district hospitals during 1997-1998, only 835 (12.1%) have been confirmed by microscopy (P. falciparum 81.7%, P. vivax 15.0%, P. malariae 2.5%, P. ovale 0.2%, mixed infections 0.6%); 22.4% of these infections were imported cases from coastal endemic areas. The efficiency of the system in monitoring the trend of malaria morbidity and in the rapid detection and response to malaria epidemics is still being evaluated."

On site diagnosis was by the use of acridine orange fluorescent staining or the ICTPf commercial diagnostic kit. To avoid possible haemolytic crises, a new single step screening method of G6PD deficiency was introduced. This approach has been accepted well by villagers and proved to be an efficient and feasible control method even in remote rural villages with endemic malaria transmission.

It has been shown earlier that specific antibodies raised against the PfP0N domain (17-61 amino acid) of the PfP0 protein inhibit P. falciparum growth in vitro. To study the properties of the rest of the protein, the remaining 61-316 amino acids on the carboxy-side of the PfP0 protein were expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein (PfP0C). Antibodies raised against PfP0C identified the 38 kDa P0 protein on a parasite Western blot analysis. An ELISA assay using both the PfP0N and PfP0C fusion proteins showed no reactivity with malaria patient sera samples, but showed extensive reactions with the immune sera. Antibodies against both the PfP0C and PfP0N domains were raised in rabbits and different inbred strains of mice. T-cells from immunized mice showed lymphoproliferation when presented with PfP0 protein domains. IgG from both anti-PfP0N and anti-PfP0C sera inhibited the growth of P. falciparum in vitro in a concentration dependent manner. The IgG did not show any significant effect on the growth of intraerythrocytic stages, but specifically inhibited re-invasion of red cells. Merozoites and sexual stages showed surface reactivity to both anti-PfP0N and anti-PfP0C antibodies in immunofluorescence assays. These properties strongly indicate PfP0 as a possible target for invasion-blocking antibodies."

In addition to a history and physical examination each child had a full blood count, a malaria parasite smear, and a urine sample (obtained by clean catch or midstream methods) for dipstick testing, microscopy and culture. Blood culture was performed where practicable. Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination were done only if clinically indicated. UTI was diagnosed on urine culture in 9 of the 98 children. Both urinary nitrite and leukocyte esterase tests were sensitive (89%) and specific (96%). Other causes of FWF were classified as non-specific viral infection (31 children), lower respiratory tract infection (11), malaria (7), meningitis (4), bacteraemia (1 neonate) and other or unknown causes. The finding of UTI in 9% of the children is consistent with data from other tropical countries. Checking for urinary tract infection, which can be done using noninvasive methods of urine collection, is an important part of the investigation of infants and children with FWF."

It was found by immunofluorescence, Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy that mAbs to epitopes of the repetitive domaine bound similarly to the CSP of all three strains. MAbs to epitopes of the flanking regions yielded either some strain differences (mAbs to the C-terminal end), or reacted only in immunofluorescence tests on whole sporozoites (mAbs to the N-terminal end). Human sera from an area endemic for malaria, two of them positive in ELISA on (NANP)40 and two negative, were tested for their reactivity with epitopes of the flanking regions of the CSP. The presence of antibodies to such epitopes could be demonstrated by Western blots and immunocytochemistry independent of the reactivity of the sera to recognize (NANP)40. All tested bound to salivary gland tissues but not to their secretory product in immunocytochemical experiments."

The clinical symptoms and signs of 35 patients were consistent with leptospirosis. The final diagnosis for the remaining patients was as follows: 136 with typhoid fever, 82 with hepatitis, 74 with malaria, 48 with infections of the respiratory tract, and 20 with fever of unknown origin. The clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis was confirmed for 24 (68.6%) patients by the combined results of the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), the reference test for leptospirosis, and of IgM ELISA, a standard laboratory test for the serodiagnosis of leptospirosis. In addition, serum specimens from 8 (2.2%) patients with a final clinical diagnosis other than leptospirosis were found to be positive in MAT and/or IgM ELISA. Compared with the results of MAT and IgM ELISA a sensitivity of 91.6% and specificity of 93.6% was calculated for the dipstick assay. Most of the serum samples from the laboratory confirmed patients gave a moderate to strong staining intensity of the antigen band of the dipstick and were easy to read. The results demonstrate that the dipstick assay is convenient to use and allows the rapid and accurate confirmation of patients with clinical suspicion of leptospirosis in areas where the disease is endemic."
CD008122,0,19038302,0,Comparison of immunogenicity of five MSP1-based malaria vaccine candidate antigens in rabbits.,"A number of laboratories around the world are producing Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-stage vaccine candidates in the pursuit of a vaccine against clinical malaria disease. These candidates are often based on the same parasite protein. Rigorous clinical development and testing of multiple candidates is limited by available resources, which underscores the need to conduct comparative studies of the different vaccine candidates. The purpose of this study was to compare five different candidate proteins all based on P. falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1). After investigators submitted their candidates, basic protein profiles were evaluated in a blinded fashion by an independent laboratory, and groups of rabbits were immunized with the proteins. Sera obtained from the rabbits were compared for antibody titers by ELISA and for functional activity by an in vitro parasite growth inhibition assay (GIA) activity, again in a blinded fashion. In selected cases the fine specificity of the antibodies was assessed. Significant differences in immunogenicity as well as the functional activity of antibodies induced by the various vaccine candidates were noted. Data from this study can assist in making decisions for further clinical development of MSP1-based candidates, and this process sets a precedent for future comparisons of malaria vaccine candidates."
CD008122,0,19836683,1,[Imported malaria: diagnostic traps and rapid tests].,"Imported malaria is a disease prevalent in France: 6,000 to 8,000 cases a year, of which 15% are pediatric cases. Despite this high incidence, the diagnosis is often delayed. The patient may then evolve to a severe form. This diagnostic delay is due to non-specific clinical symptoms in children. The most common symptoms are fever and digestive disorders (diarrhea, vomiting). In the absence of thrombocytopenia, the laboratory tests are not very useful for diagnosis. Parasitological examinations are dependent on the experience of the biologist, particularly in cases of low parasitemia as those observed in children who have received partial chemoprophylaxis. The recent introduction of rapid tests based on the detection of Plasmodium proteins, allows emergency remedy to this problem. The blood smears remains the gold standard and has to be used to confirm the results of rapid tests. If rapid tests improve the detection of Plasmodium in 2009, it remains mandatory to evoke the diagnosis of malaria in any febrile child coming from an endemic area."
CD008122,0,8486957,0,Decline in meningococcal antibody levels in African children 5 years after vaccination and the lack of an effect of booster immunization.,"Antibodies to group A meningococcal polysaccharide were measured by hemagglutination (HA) and by ELISA in sera obtained from Gambian children before vaccination and 3 weeks, 2 years, and 5 years after vaccination with a group A + group C meningococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine. Children were 1-4 years old at the time of vaccination. Most showed a good initial response to vaccination, including those aged 1-2 years. However, antibody titers declined progressively during follow-up, and 5 years after vaccination, antibody titers measured by both HA and ELISA had returned to prevaccination levels. This decline was not influenced significantly by a booster dose of vaccine given 2 years after initial immunization. Administration of malaria chemoprophylaxis reduced the rate at which antibody levels fell after initial immunization. Sustained protection of children against group A meningococcal disease will require the development of vaccines that are immunogenic in infants and that can induce T cell memory."

We performed a blinded evaluation of a nonisotopic colorimetric PCR-based assay (Digene SHARP Signal System) and compared the results with those obtained by microscopy and nested PCR for the detection of P. falciparum malaria in 150 febrile travelers. By using nested PCR as the reference standard, the colorimetric assay had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 95.4% for the detection of P. falciparum. This PCR-based nonisotopic assay is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for the detection of falciparum malaria in returned travelers."

Results from DHS 2005 indicate that the coverage of key malaria interventions was low. The government of Ethiopia has set the national goal of full population coverage with a mean of 2 long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) per household through distribution of about 20 million LLIN by the end of 2007. The aim of this study was to generate baseline information on malaria parasite prevalence and coverage of key malaria control interventions in Oromia and SNNPR and to relate the prevalence survey findings to routine surveillance data just before further mass distribution of LLINs."
CD008122,0,16813240,1,"[Efficiency of KAT-quick P.f. test (KAT medical, SAR) among the populations of drug-resistant parasites].","The KAT-Quick P.f. test (KAT Medical, South African Republic) is based on the detection of protein HPR II produced by trophozoites and young gametocytes of P. falciparum. This test was conducted by the authors in the distribution areas of P. falciparum strains differing in the spectrum of drug resistance. Five hundred and forty-nine blood samples from febrile patients in Vietnam (n=84), Sierra Leone (n=41), Nigeria (n=14), Tanzania (n=8), Kenya (n=5), and Tadjikistan (n=397) were tested. Microscopy served as a primary control. Detection of P. falciparum DNA, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with included primers (nested PCR) of the most sensitive modification of PCR was a final control. The efficiency of the KAT-Quick P.f. test was estimated as a ratio of the number of its positive results to those of PCR. It was equal to 98-95%. The KAT-Quick P.f. test revealed no false-positive case associated with the genome of the parasite. The specificity of the test was determined as a ratio of the number of its negative (no P. falciparum) results to those of PCR. The blood samples from patients with vivax malaria and from those with nonmalarial fever were investigated. There was no cross reaction of the KAT-Quick P.f. test system for P. falciparum with that for P. vivax. The KAT-Quick P.f. test yielded no positive reaction with the blood from patients with non-malarial fever. Drug resistance depending on the spectrum of specific drugs caused its emergence may be determined by one or several mechanisms that are ultimately determined by one, the key mechanism. Thus, the findings suggest that multidrug resistance of P. falciparum does not trigger the occurrence of changes in its surface antigen--HRPII that is responsible for the efficiency of the KAT-Quick P.f. test. These may be also extrapolated to other rapid tests patterned after the same principle."
CD008122,0,19635870,0,Evaluation of Leishmania species reactivity in human serologic diagnosis of leishmaniasis.,"The sensitivities and specificities of IgG-ELISA and IgG flow cytometry based techniques using different Leishmania species were determined using sera collected from 40 cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis patients. The flow cytometry technique, using promastigote parasite forms, performed better than total soluble extract IgG-ELISA. At the species level, the use of Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major as antigens in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) decreased the overall sensitivity. To assess the specificity of these tests, sera from malaria, toxoplasmosis, amoebiasis, schistosomiasis, and leprosy patients were used. We also included sera from Leishmania non-infected endemic individuals. The cutaneous species displayed a decreased specificity in both assays. Although more sensitive, flow cytometry using promastigote parasite forms generally presented lower levels of specificity when compared with total extract of IgG-ELISA. Overall, the results of the study show the potential of IgG flow cytometry for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Although highly sensitive, a refinement of the flow cytometry method should be performed to improve the overall specificity."

CD008122,0,17919672,1,Malaria diagnosis under field conditions in the Venezuelan Amazon.,"To improve practical, accurate diagnosis of malaria in the Amazon rainforest of Venezuela, two rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) (OptiMAL-IT) and FalciVax) and a laboratory light microscope, used in the field with a battery-operated head lamp as an external light source, were evaluated against the standard laboratory microscope procedure for malaria detection. One hundred and thirty-six Yanomami patients were studied for the presence of malaria parasites. Thirty-three patients (24%) were positive for malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae). Twenty-one (64%) of the positive patients had <100 parasites/microl. Both RDTs showed poor sensitivity (24.2% for OptiMAL-IT) and 36.4% for FalciVax) but good specificity (99% both for OptiMAL-IT) and FalciVax). Field and laboratory microscopy showed sensitivities of 94% and 91%, respectively. The kappa coefficient was 0.90, indicating a high agreement between field and laboratory microscopy. We conclude that (i) adequate slide reading cannot be substituted by either of the two RDTs in the Venezuelan Amazon and (ii) the use of a light source such as that described above makes slide reading more feasible than hitherto in remote areas without electricity."
CD008122,0,1665050,0,Plasmodium berghei: susceptibility and growth characteristics of hepatoma cells as hosts for malaria schizonts.,"Three different human hepatoma cell lines (Hep G2, London; Hep G2, Brussels; Mahlavu) have been compared with respect to susceptibility for in vitro infection with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites and subsequent development of mature schizonts and infectious merozoites. The results were very different, even with host cells derived from the same parent line. Both Hep G2 lines were able to function as host cells, but the Mahlavu line was completely refractory. Hep G2 (London) was even more susceptible than the Hep G2-A16 clone. Hepatoma cells harbouring young exoerythrocytic forms permitted their development to mature schizonts and production of merozoites inside the intraperitoneal cavity of OF1 mice. Pronounced differences in growth parameters of subpopulations of Hep G2 cells were stated as well. Optimal conditions for in vitro culture of the most suitable cell line were identified. Finally, the seeding, plating and cloning efficiencies were determined."

The ELISA uses two commercial monoclonal antibodies and provides a drastically cheaper alternative to the test kits previously used in the HRP2 drug sensitivity test. The assay is simple to establish and perform. The sensitivity is comparable and the drug sensitivity results very closely match those obtained with the commercial ELISA kits (R(2) = 0.979; P < 0.001; mean log difference at the 50% inhibitory concentration = 0.07).

CD008122,0,10492783,0,Onchocerciasis hyperendemic in the Unturán Mountains: the value of recombinant antigens in describing a new transmission area in southern Venezuela.,"A recently described hyperendemic onchocerciasis area, located in the Unturán Mountains (between the Siapa and Orinoco basins) of southern Venezuela was studied using a cocktail of 3 low molecular weight onchocercal recombinant antigens (OvMBP/10, OvMBP/11, and OvMBP/29). The resulting seroepidemiological data were compared with those from a hypoendemic community (Altamira) situated in the northern coastal mountain range. Parasitological (skin biopsy) and serological (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) methods for the specific diagnosis of Onchocerca volvulus in these 2 very different endemic areas were, respectively, 88% and 96% sensitive in Unturán, and 57% and 91% sensitive in Altamira. The mean microfilarial load, the mean optical density (OD), and the seropositivity rates all increased significantly with age in both communities. The serological variables (mean OD and prevalence of anti-O. volvulus antibodies) were both significantly higher in Unturán than in Altamira for children and young adults (aged < 25 years), although above this age no differences between communities were detected. Seroprevalence had already reached 50% in the under 15 year-olds examined at Unturán but was just 5% at Altamira for the same age-class. The prevalence of specific antibodies (mainly a marker of exposure to risk of infection) exceeded 85% in the remaining age-categories at the hyperendemic area. This is in agreement with the high community microfilarial load recorded in Unturán (> 20 mf/mg) and the presence of sclerosing keratitis and hanging groin, suggesting that onchocerciasis is a public health problem in this community. The ELISA test used here, based on a cocktail of 3 low molecular weight onchocercal recombinant antigens, appears, therefore, to constitute a practical tool for the description of endemicity levels in remote areas, particularly given the fact that finger-prick blood samples are routinely taken from children in the Upper Orinoco region for surveys of malaria incidence. Such studies could aid in defining the true extent of the Amazon focus (still unknown) and providing priority indicators for the selection of communities where onchocerciasis control programmes should be implemented."

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay incorporating the protein ([NANP]15 + NVDP)2 was used. More than 22% of adults produced high antibody titres in all 3 months, even though transmission had stopped. Malaria prevalence in these high-responders was the same as in the rest of the population and the number of consanguineous high-responders was no higher than would be expected by chance. The data suggest that individuals at prolonged, equal risk of malaria inoculation display intrinsic differences in their ability to produce CS antibody."

The ParaSight(R)-F test, which is based on qualitative detection by monoclonal antibody of the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) histidin-rich protein-II in the blood, showed promising results. As some antigens of Pf have been detected in the urine, we assessed the efficiency of the ParaSight(R)-F test in the whole blood and in the urine using microscopy and PCR as gold standards. One hundred and twelve children living in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) were recruited during a cross-sectional community survey. When using microscopy as reference, the ParaSight(R)-F test applied to whole blood had 84% sensitivity and 77% specificity. The semi-quantitative assessment showed that the intensity of the color on the wick correlated with parasite density. The ParaSight(R)-F test performed on urine had 81% sensitivity but only 26% specificity. Very similar results for blood and urine were obtained when using PCR as reference. The present evaluation of the ParaSight(R)-F test applied to blood compares well with findings in endemic areas of Africa or Asia, and confirms its usefulness to diagnose Pf infection in endemic areas of the South Pacific. Because of the lack of specificity, the ParaSight(R)-F test performed on urine cannot be recommended."

CD008122,0,17912355,0,Haemoglobin C and S role in acquired immunity against Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"A recently proposed mechanism of protection for haemoglobin C (HbC; beta6Glu-->Lys) links an abnormal display of PfEMP1, an antigen involved in malaria pathogenesis, on the surface of HbC infected erythrocytes together with the observation of reduced cytoadhesion of parasitized erythrocytes and impaired rosetting in vitro. We investigated the impact of this hypothesis on the development of acquired immunity against Plasmodium falciparum variant surface antigens (VSA) encoding PfEMP1 in HbC in comparison with HbA and HbS carriers of Burkina Faso. We measured: i) total IgG against a single VSA, A4U, and against a panel of VSA from severe malaria cases in human sera from urban and rural areas of Burkina Faso of different haemoglobin genotypes (CC, AC, AS, SC, SS); ii) total IgG against recombinant proteins of P. falciparum asexual sporozoite, blood stage antigens, and parasite schizont extract; iii) total IgG against tetanus toxoid. Results showed that the reported abnormal cell-surface display of PfEMP1 on HbC infected erythrocytes observed in vitro is not associated to lower anti- PfEMP1 response in vivo. Higher immune response against the VSA panel and malaria antigens were observed in all adaptive genotypes containing at least one allelic variant HbC or HbS in the low transmission urban area whereas no differences were detected in the high transmission rural area. In both contexts the response against tetanus toxoid was not influenced by the beta-globin genotype. These findings suggest that both HbC and HbS affect the early development of naturally acquired immunity against malaria. The enhanced immune reactivity in both HbC and HbS carriers supports the hypothesis that the protection against malaria of these adaptive genotypes might be at least partially mediated by acquired immunity against malaria."
CD008122,0,8629049,0,Humoral immune responses to the Plasmodium falciparum antigen Pf155 RESA in adults with differential clinical conditions from an Indian zone where malaria is endemic.,"Ring infected erythrocyte surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf155/RESA) has been considered as a vaccine candidate. However, the relative immunogenicity of this antigen has not been studied in Indian populations. Pf155/RESA was investigated for its immunogenicity by studying humoral immune responses against Pf155/RESA and Pf155/RESA derived peptides (P1, P2 representing immunodominant epitopes from the 3' and P3 from the 5' repeat regions) by erythrocyte membrane immunofluorescence (EMIF) assay and by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in P. falciparum primed donors living in hyperendemic malarious areas (Orissa State, India) where P. falciparum infections are highly prevalent. Subjects of different clinical status namely acute (A), clinically immune (CI) and acute with history of repeated P. falciparum infections (R) were included in this study. All the donors were seropositive against the crude antigen. There was considerable variation in the responses among the donors. While humoral responses in the plasmas against the P2 peptide (EENV)4 were significantly higher in magnitude and in frequency in the CI donors than in the A donors, no positive response was seen in the R donors. The responses to the peptides P1 (EENVEHDA)2 and P3 (DDEHVEEPTVA)2 were poor both in the A and in the CI groups. Whereas, most of the R donors were seropositive against the P3. The present results indicate that Pf155/RESA contains B cell epitopes which were recognized differently by the immune system of individuals living in malaria-hyperendemic areas of India who have been primed by natural infection. Our studies also suggest that in order to investigate the possible functional role of a given antigen, study of immune responses against the antigen in donors of different clinical status may be useful."
CD008122,0,9769889,1,[ParaSight F in the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria].,"The ParaSight F is a new diagnostic test for Plasmodium falciparum infections and is based on the detection of a trophozoite-derived antigen, the histidine rich protein II (HRP-II). To assess the usefulness of this test, we conducted a prospective study and analyzed 62 blood specimens from 38 patients, using thin blood films, thick blood films and the ParaSight F test. Compared to thick blood film, on samples taken before and during treatment, the ParaSight F test had 86.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In 31.5% of P. falciparum infected patients, parasitemia was lower than 1 parasite/1000 red blood cells, with all specimens being positive by the ParaSight F test. In 15 cases, specimens were negative by thin blood film, but were positive by thick blood film and by the ParaSight F test. Two patients had, after their treatment was started, positive results by ParaSight F and negative results by thick blood film. Cross-reactivity occurred neither with other Plasmodium species, nor in cases of severe inflammatory syndrome. Persistence of antigenemia was monitored in 14 patients receiving quinine. At day five of treatment, antigenemia persisted in seven patients. In conclusion, the ParaSight F test does not allow following up the efficacy of treatment, identifying other Plasmodium species, or assessing parasitemia. However, because this test is easy to perform and has good sensitivity and specificity, it is a useful tool in emergent context, in cases of parasitemia lower than the thin blood film threshold, and in cases morphologically difficult to decipher."
CD008122,0,2459979,0,Immune response of humans to the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum: limited T cell response to the immunodominant central repeat region.,"Most adults in highly malarious areas have antibodies to the repeat region of the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum. To determine if a T cell epitope on the repeat region stimulated T cell help for this antibody, we used R32tet32, a recombinant construct derived from the repeat region of the circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum, to stimulate in vitro mononuclear cells from residents of an area hyperendemic for malaria. Three groups differing in the length of time they had resided in a malarious area were studied. The percentage of individuals in each group who had positive antibody responses to R32tet32 increased with increased exposure to malaria. However, antibody positivity was not correlated with in vitro lymphocyte proliferation responses to the antigen. Lymphocytes from 79% of the individuals showing serum antibodies to R32tet32 failed to respond in a lymphocyte transformation assay, suggesting that T cell helper activity in these individuals was based upon the recognition of a T cell epitope not located within this peptide."

To combat the spread of malaria, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and community health education were provided to the people in this province by the Lao Ministry of Health and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. In order to document the current malaria situation, an active case detection (ACD) survey using rapid diagnostic tests was conducted at 23 sites from June to July, the rainy season, in 2005. A total of 1711 villagers from 403 households participated in the survey. The proportion of positive cases was 0.7% (12/1711) with a range in each village of 0-8.2%. The low infection rate observed in this ACD survey was consistent with the decrease in the number of slide-positive malaria cases at local health facilities (from over 5000 cases to 536 cases), indicating the substantial progress made in malaria control. Although the reduction of malaria cases can be attributed to multiple factors, continued promotion of the proper use of ITNs as well as community-based testing and treatment services, especially in remote areas, may lead to a further reduction of malaria cases in the province."

In this study, IgG3 and IgG1 were shown to be the predominant subclasses. Generally, IgG2 were coexpressed with IgG1 and IgG3 while IgG4 was found to coexpress with other three IgG subclasses. The levels of specific IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 increased significantly with age (r = 0.295, p = 0.000; r = 0.416, p = 0.000; r = 0.320, p = 0.000, respectively). The data indicate that the higher antibody production required continuous stimulation under natural condition. Furthermore, the levels of specific IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 increased in immune individuals without clinical malaria, reported in adolescents and adults, were associated with malaria resistance. Similar results were found in children with different patterns of IgG subclasses in which the specific IgG2 and IgG3, but not IgG1 was related to resistance."

CD008122,0,17148078,1,Bedside diagnosis of imported malaria using the Binax Now malaria antigen detection test.,"Malaria may be misdiagnosed in non-endemic countries when the necessary experience for rapid expert microscopy is lacking. Rapid diagnostic tests may improve the diagnosis and may play a role as a bedside diagnostic tool. In a multicentre study we recruited patients suspected of malaria over a period of 14 months. The Binax Now Malaria rapid test was used at the bedside and in the clinical microbiology laboratory. The training of clinical staff was monitored and their experience with the use of the test was recorded. 542 patients were included, 80 of whom had malaria diagnosed by microscopy. The rapid test used at the bedside had a sensitivity of 88% for the detection of P. falciparum compared to 95% when the test was performed in the microbiology laboratory. The risk of technical problems and invalid tests was highest when the test was used at the bedside. The rapid diagnostic test may be useful for the diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria when used by routine laboratory staff, but could lead to misdiagnoses when used at the bedside. Microscopy is still essential in order to identify the few missed diagnoses, to determine the degree of parasitaemia, and to ensure species diagnosis, including mixed infections."

Thirty-two adult Gambians in groups of four to eight received one, two or three doses of FP9 CS and/or MVA CS. No serious adverse event was observed following vaccination. The most immunogenic regimen was two doses of FP9 followed by a single dose of MVA 4 weeks later (an average of 1000 IFN-gamma spot forming units/million PBMCs). This level of effector T-cell responses appears higher than that seen in previously reported studies of CS-based candidate malaria vaccines."
CD008122,0,9632988,0,Prevention of HIV transmission by blood transfusion in the developing world: achievements and continuing challenges.,"In industrialized countries, the use of sensitive HIV screening tests, donor deferral, and more conservative use of blood have resulted in a dramatic decrease in the transmission of HIV infection by blood transfusion. The risk of HIV transmission in the USA by blood screened negative for HIV antibody was recently estimated at one in 440,000-660,000 donations. Despite this low risk, continued public concern has compelled blood collection agencies and policy makers to continue to search for more sensitive HIV screening tests. Genome amplification techniques are receiving increased attention and are being piloted in Germany. HIV-1 p24 antigen testing was implemented in the USA in March 1996. In the first 18 months of p24 antigen testing, an estimated 18 million blood donations were tested at a cost of US$90 million to detect three antigen-positive, antibody-negative donations. However, in many developing countries where severe anemia is widespread and the prevalence of HIV infection among blood donors is orders of magnitude greater than in industrialized countries, the blood supply is either incompletely screened or not screened at all for HIV antibody. Although the contribution of transfusion-transmitted infection to the HIV epidemic has not been accurately assessed, an estimated 5-10% of HIV infections in developing countries are due to blood transfusion. In a study conducted 1 year after implementation of HIV blood screening in the largest hospital in the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an estimated 25% of pediatric HIV infections, and 40% of infections among children over 1 years of age, were due to transfusion. Lack of commitment by national governments and international aid organizations to this fundamental element of HIV prevention has resulted in a shortage of basic equipment, supplies, and trained personnel for blood screening. Moreover, provision of test kits alone cannot prevent HIV transmission by transfusion in resource-poor areas. More comprehensive programs are needed to improve the recruitment and retention of safe donors, essential laboratory services for blood banking and screening, technical training and supervision, appropriate use of transfusions, and the prevention of severe anemia. This article summarizes the steps being taken by developing countries to prevent HIV transmission by blood transfusion, lessons learned, and the work that still lies ahead."

In the present study we investigated the serum levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). MIP-1 alpha is a neutrophil chemotactic protein important in acute and chronic inflammation. Recent studies demonstrated that MIP-1 alpha may also act as potent inhibitor of hemopoetic stem cell proliferation, which may be important in the development of prolonged anemia in patients suffering from Plasmodium falciparum malaria. IL-8 serum concentrations correlate with severity and outcome of infectious diseases. Moreover, recent reports indicate that IL-8 plays a major role in fatal gram-negative sepsis. It was the aim of this study to investigate the time course of MIP-1 alpha and IL-8 concentrations in patients suffering from acute P. falciparum infection. Blood samples of 20 patients suffering from severe P. falciparum malaria were investigated. MIP-1 alpha and IL-8 concentrations were determined using ELISA technique at admission, on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Maximal concentrations of MIP-1 alpha and IL-8 were found on Day 14, at a time when parasites were not detected in the smears. The serum levels of IL-8 on the day of admission were correlated to the parasite count. No correlation was seen between the hematokrit values and the MIP-1 alpha concentrations at any time."
CD008122,0,15679634,0,Schistosomiasis co-infection in humans influences inflammatory markers in uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Malaria and schistosomiasis are the two major parasite diseases present in developing countries. The epidemiological co-infection with schistosomiasis could influence the development of the physiological reaction associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection in human. Most studies have demonstrated the association of circulating levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) and soluble Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptors (sTNF-RI and sTNF-RII) with the morbidity of malaria. In the present study, we showed that Schistosoma haematobium co-infection influences, in an age-dependent manner, the unbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory circulating cytokines that play a key role during malaria infection. Indeed, children co-infected by S. haematobium have higher levels of IFN-gamma and sTNF-RII than children infected only by P. falciparum. In contrast, co-infected adults presented a significant increase of IFN-gamma, IL-10, TGF-beta, sTNF-RI and sTNF-RII rates and IL-10/TNF-alpha ratio. Taken together, this study indicates that schistosomiasis co-infection can unbalance the regulation of inflammatory factors in uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The possible consequences of the schistosomiasis co-infection for age-dependent malaria morbidity are discussed."
CD008122,0,12950138,1,Development and evaluation of an immunochromatographic kit for the detection of antibody to Plasmodium vivax infection in South Korea.,"Malaria is a major parasitic disease in tropical areas. Three to five hundred million people suffer from the disease and it kill a million people per year. Blood smear observation was developed for the diagnosis of malaria, but the examination needs skilled experts and exact diagnosis is time consuming. A kit based on immunochromatography can be a reliable and rapid method for clinical diagnosis, even in the hands of inexperienced personnel. However, all such currently developed kits can only diagnose P. falciparum malaria. In our previous report, the C-terminal region of P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (PvcMSP) was cloned and expressed in E. coli. In the present study, we developed an immunochromatographic kit using this PvcMSP for the diagnosis of specific antibody to P. vivax malaria in serum samples. The kit was used to examine sera from vivax malaria patients and non-malaria- infected person and the test showed 100% sensitivity (78/78) and 98.3% specificity (58/59). This result demonstrated that the immunochromatographic kit for P. vivax antibody detection is applicable for the rapid and precise diagnosis of P. vivax malaria."
CD008122,0,11487366,1,Malaria diagnosis and treatment under the strategy of the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI): relevance of laboratory support from the rapid immunochromatographic tests of ICT Malaria P.f/P.v and OptiMal.,"The algorithm developed for the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) provides guidelines for the treatment of paediatric malaria. In areas where malaria is endemic, for example, the IMCI strategy may indicate that children who present with fever, a recent history of fever and/or pallor should receive antimalarial chemotherapy. In many holo-endemic areas, it is unclear whether laboratory tests to confirm that such signs are the result of malaria would be very relevant or useful. Children from a holo-endemic region of Tanzania were therefore checked for malarial parasites by microscopy and by using two rapid immunochromatographic tests (RIT) for the diagnosis of malaria (ICT Malaria P.f/P.v and OptiMal. At the time they were tested, each of these children had been targeted for antimalarial treatment (following the IMCI strategy) because of fever and/or pallor. Only 70% of the 395 children classified to receive antimalarial drugs by the IMCI algorithm had malarial parasitaemias (68.4% had Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites, 1.3% only P. falciparum gametocytes, 0.3% P. ovale and 0.3% P. malariae). As indicators of P. falciparum trophozoites in the peripheral blood, fever had a sensitivity of 93.0% and a specificity of 15.5% whereas pallor had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 50.8%. The RIT both had very high corresponding sensitivities (of 100.0% for the ICT and 94.0% for OptiMal) but the specificity of the ICT (74.0%) was significantly lower than that for OptiMal (100.0%). Fever and pallor were significantly associated with the P. falciparum asexual parasitaemias that equalled or exceeded the threshold intensity (2000/microl) that has the optimum sensitivity and specificity for the definition of a malarial episode. Diagnostic likelihood ratios (DLR) showed that a positive result in the OptiMal test (DLR = infinity) was a better indication of malaria than a positive result in the ICT (DLR = 3.85). In fact, OptiMal had diagnostic reliability (0.93) which approached that of an ideal test and, since it only detects live parasites, OptiMal is superior to the ICT in monitoring therapeutic responses. Although the RIT may seem attractive for use in primary health facilities because relatively inexperienced staff can perform them, the high cost of these tests is prohibitive. In holo-endemic areas, use of RIT or microscopical examination of bloodsmears may only be relevant when malaria needs to be excluded as a cause of illness (e.g. prior to treatment with toxic or expensive drugs, or during malaria epidemics). Wherever the effective drugs for the first-line treatment of malaria are cheap (e.g. chloroquine and Fansidar), treatment based on clinical diagnosis alone should prove cost-saving in health facilities without microscopy."
CD008122,0,1695491,0,Safety and immunogenicity of a Plasmodium vivax sporozoite vaccine.,"A recombinant DNA Plasmodium vivax sporozoite vaccine containing the repeating region of the Salvador I strain circumsporozoite (CS) protein was produced in Escherichia coli. This vaccine was tested in 13 naive volunteers at doses of 10-1,000 micrograms. No serious adverse reactions were noted. None of 4 volunteers receiving the 10 micrograms dose developed antibodies measurable by ELISA. Six of 9 volunteers in the other dose groups developed measurable antibodies: 5 of 5 volunteers receiving 100 micrograms and 1 of 4 receiving 1,000 micrograms. Antibody responses measured by immunofluorescence assays paralleled those seen by ELISA. None of the volunteers developed antisera that inhibited sporozoite invasion of human hepatoma cells in vitro. Lack of a classical anamnestic response and lack of a typical dose response to increasing amounts of antigen suggests the possible presence of an immunosuppressive epitope in the repetitive region of the CS protein."
CD008122,0,1695490,0,High frequency of antibody response to Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte antigens during acute malaria infections in Papua New Guinea highlanders.,"Sera from 62 adult Papua New Guinea highlanders with suspected acute malaria were tested by competitive ELISA for the presence of antibodies capable of inhibiting binding of 8 monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) directed against epitopes on gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum. Between 33% and 72% of the malaria cases were inhibitory, depending on the Mab. There was no difference between the proportion of persons with P. falciparum (asexuals or gametocytes) and P. vivax whose sera inhibited Mab binding, but all 3 categories had a significantly higher proportion of inhibitors than persons who were malaria negative. The amount of gametocyte antibody recognizing epitopes on Pfs 48/45 and Pfs 230 increased with increasing numbers of previous malaria episodes. The proportion of sera from these relatively nonimmune adults which had gamete antibodies was similar to the proportion seen in sera from a highly endemic area, suggesting that antibody responses to these epitopes are a part of the initial response observed after a limited number of malaria episodes."

The results showed that the nested PCR could amplify a constant size of desired SSUrDNA fragment of P. falciparum which was further confirmed by digestion of restriction endonuclease and could detect parasitemia level of 0.8 x 10(-6). It has great potentials for identifying Plasmodium species in ring form of erythrocytic stage and detecting mixed Plasmodium infections. Therefore, it is suggested that this method is sensitive, accurate, simple and rapid in detecting Plasmodium falciparum in blood samples for malaria diagnosis."
CD008122,0,8980591,1,ParaSight-F test to diagnose malaria in hypo-endemic and epidemic prone regions of Vietnam.,"The antigen capture ParaSight-F test was evaluated during a drug sensitivity survey in a hypoendemic region of northern Vietnam. When only asexual blood forms of P. falciparum were considered, sensitivity of ParaSight-F was 100%, specificity 88% (95% CI 95-80%), positive predictive value 68% (95% CI 85-50%) and negative predictive value 100%. ParaSight-F proved very convenient for rapid screening and selection of patients to enrol in a drug sensitivity study. In northern Vietnam, the introduction of the test as a routine diagnostic tool is not justified, considering its high cost, the necessity to carry out the treatment of presumptive Plasmodium vivax cases and the persistence of positive reactions following treatment. However, the test will be a valuable tool in remote areas in emergency situations, where rapid confirmation of a P. falciparum outbreak is required."

We examined the performance of Widal test in a community field site and compared it with Typhidot and Tubex tests for diagnosis of typhoid fever. Blood samples were collected from 6697 patients with fever for > or =3 days for microscopy, culture, and serologic testing and from randomly selected 172 consenting healthy individuals to assess the baseline Widal anti-Typhi O lipopolysaccharide antibody (anti-TO) and anti-Typhi H flagellar antibody (anti-TH) titers. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the 3 serologic tests were calculated using culture-confirmed typhoid fever cases as ""true positives"" and paratyphoid fever and malaria cases as ""true negatives"". Comparing cutoff values for the Widal test, an anti-TO titer of 1/80 was optimal with 58% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 69% PPV, and 77% NPV. Sensitivity was increased to 67% when the Widal test was done on the 5th day of illness and thereafter. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of Typhidot and Tubex were not better than Widal test. There is a need for more efficient rapid diagnostic test for typhoid fever especially during the acute stage of the disease. Until then, culture remains the method of choice."

CD008122,0,2682486,0,Non-linear phenomena in host-parasite interactions.,"The paper examines non-linear dynamical phenomena in host-parasite interactions by reference to a series of different problems ranging from the impact on transmission of control measures based on vaccination and chemotherapy, to the effects of immunological responses targeted at different stages in a parasite's life-cycle. Throughout, simple mathematical models are employed to aid in interpretation. Analyses reveal that the influence of a defined control measure on the prevalence or intensity of infection, whether vaccination or drug treatment, is non-linearly related to the magnitude of control effort (as defined by the proportion of individuals vaccinated or treated with a drug). Consideration of the relative merits of gametocyte and sporozoite vaccines against malarial parasites suggests that very high leves of cohort immunization will be required to block transmission in endemic areas, with the former type of vaccine being more effective in reducing transmission for a defined level of coverage and the latter being better with respect to a reduction in morbidity. The inclusion of genetic elements in analyses of the transmission of helminth parasites reveals complex non-linear patterns of change in the abundance of different parasite genotypes under selection pressures imposed by either the host immunological defences or the application of chemotherapeutic agents. When resistance genes are present in parasite populations, the degree to which abundance can be suppressed by chemotherapy depends critically on the frequency and intensity of application, with intermediate values of the former being optimal. A more detailed consideration of the impact of immunological defences on parasite population growth within an individual host, by reference to the erythrocytic cycle of malaria, suggests that the effectiveness of a given immunological response is inversely related to the life-expectancy of the target stage in the parasite's developmental cycle."

Here, we measured antibodies to three block 2 variants and MSP-1(19) among Amazonian gold miners and examined the repertoire of block 2 variants in local parasites. Main findings were as follows: (1) Only seven different block 2 variants were found in 18 DNA sequences analyzed. (2) No major difference was observed in IgG subclass distribution of antibodies from symptomatic P. falciparum-infected patients, asymptomatic parasite carriers, and non-infected subjects. (3) Antibodies to all block 2 antigens, but not to MSP-1(19), were biased towards IgG3 across different strata of cumulative malaria exposure. (4) Similar proportions of symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects failed to recognize the block 2 variant expressed by infecting parasites. These negative results underscore the limits of conventional antibody assays to evaluate clinical immunity to malaria."
CD008122,0,116555,0,The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for malaria. I. The use of in vitro-cultured Plasmodium falciparum as antigen.,"Using the Panama II strain of Plasmodium falciparum obtained from continuous in vitro culture as antigen, the micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to test serum samples from 50 persons from the southeastern United States and serum specimens collected weekly from four non-immune and nine semi-immune patients infected with P. falciparum. None of the 50 sera from the United States had ELISA antibody titers greater than 1:80. The nine semi-immune patients had rapid ELISA antibody responses (titers greater than 1:2560) following patent parasitemia. ELISA titers remained elevated despite disappearance of patent parasitemia, and declined gradually following curative antimalarial therapy. The ELISA responses observed in the four non-immune patients were more variable, though positive titers appeared rapidly with patent parasitemia. Maximum titers were lower than those observed in semi-immune patients. These results demonstrate that P. falciparum obtained from continuous in vitro culture is an excellent antigen for the micro-ELISA test for malaria. However, further assessments of the ELISA are needed to identify the conditions associated with positive responses."

The sensitivity of this PCR test was high, as minimal as 0.1 parasite per one microliter of blood sample and a minimum of four copies of the target gene could be detected. For the diagnosis of mixed infection of two Plasmodium spp., there were no apparent competition or cross-reaction between the majority and minority Plasmodium species. The multiplex PCR was evaluated on 210 clinical samples and 60 normal controls. The PCR test yielded highly concordant results with microscopic examination, with the only one exception of a mixed (P. falciparum plus P. vivax) infection case, which was diagnosed as a single infection of P. falciparum by microscopy. We propose that the multiplex PCR is a sensitive, specific, and rapid tool that can serve as a useful differential diagnostic tool for detecting P. falciparum and P. vivax."
CD008122,0,2669101,0,Antisporozoite vaccine for malaria: experimental basis and current status.,"A major sporozoite surface antigen, the circumsporozoite protein, has been identified in all four malaria parasites affecting humans and in numerous species causing malaria in rodents and simians. The corresponding genes have been cloned and sequenced, and considerable similarities are apparent. An extensive central region of these proteins consists of tandemly repeated sequences of four to 16 amino acids. The sporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum has 37-41 repeats of four amino acids: NANP (asparagine-alanine-asparagine-proline). Most sera from people in endemic areas that react with sporozoites also recognize the dodecamer (NANP)3. Conjugated to a carrier, (NANP)3 is an excellent immunogen for rabbits and mice. NANP has recently served as the basis for two experimental malaria vaccines tested in volunteers. One of these vaccines, (NANP)32 tet32, was genetically engineered in Escherichia coli; the other consisted of the synthetic peptide (NANP)3 conjugated to tetanus toxoid. Most peptide-immunized volunteers developed antipeptide/sporozoite antibodies; however, there was no booster effect, and only one of three individuals was completely protected. For optimal protection, future vaccines must not only contain the B cell epitope but also induce T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells producing interferon-gamma, which has been shown to inhibit the development of liver-stage parasites."

Three markers were analysed by immunoassays: the microtubule-associated protein tau, for degenerated axons; neuron-specific enolase (NSE), for neurons; and S100B for astrocytes. The mean concentration of tau proteins in the CSF was significantly raised in patients with severe malaria compared with controls (P=0.0003) as reported for other central nervous system diseases. By contrast, the mean concentration of NSE and S100B remained within the normal range. Tau levels were associated with duration of coma (P=0.004) and S100B was associated with convulsions (P=0.006). Concentrations of axonal and astrocyte degeneration markers also were associated with vital organ dysfunction. No association was found between the level of markers of brain parenchymal damage on admission and a fatal outcome. On admission to hospital, patients with severe malaria had biochemical evidence of brain parenchymal damage predominantly affecting axons."

A total of 12,937 individuals from 176 villages were screened for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasite species using the OptiMal Rapid Diagnostic Test. Malaria prevalence was generally low but highly focal and variable with the proportion of parasitemia at 2.2% (range: 0.4% to 6.5%). Despite no significant differences in age or sex-specific prevalence rates, 7% of households accounted for the positive cases and 90% of these were P. falciparum. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that mud walls were positively associated with malaria infection (OR [odds ratio] = 1.6 [95% CI: 1.2, 2.2], P < 0.008).

CD008122,0,3516259,0,Invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites: evidence for receptor heterogeneity and two receptors.,"Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites with different capabilities of invading sialic acid-deficient erythrocytes were identified. Thai-2 parasites cultured in Tn erythrocytes invaded neuraminidase-treated and Tn erythrocytes twice as efficiently as Thai-2 parasites cultured in normal erythrocytes and seven to ten times more efficiently than a cloned line of Camp parasites cultured in normal erythrocytes. All three parasite lines required sialic acid for optimal invasion, but Thai-2 parasites cultured in Tn erythrocytes invaded neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes with 45% efficiency whereas Camp parasites invaded neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes with less than 10% efficiency. P falciparum malaria parasites probably possess two receptors: one that binds to a sialic acid-dependent ligand and another that binds to a sialic acid-independent ligand. Parasites may differ in the quantity or affinity of their receptors for the sialic acid-independent ligand."

Two markers were analysed by immunoassays: the microtubule-associated protein tau for degenerated axons and S-100B for astrocytes. The level of tau proteins in the CSF was significantly elevated in children with cerebral malaria compared with either malaria with prostration or malaria with seizures but normal consciousness (p<0.001). Elevated tau was also found to be associated with impaired delivery of oxygen (severe anaemia), severe metabolic acidosis manifesting as respiratory distress (increased respiratory rate and deep acidotic breathing) and at higher parasite densities. Elevated S-100B in children was associated with an increased risk of repeated seizures. This study provides evidence that axonal injury is associated with malaria coma and identifies the potential role of severe anaemia, acidosis and hyperparasitaemia to causing brain parenchymal damage in children with malaria."

Consecutive captures of mosquitos were organized twice a month over a year and the species of the mosquitos identified. Also, the prevalences and densities of Plasmodium spp. were determined every 2 months in a sample of children who lived in the village. Anopheles gambiae, A. funestus, and A. nili were the local vectors, but only the first two played a predominant role in both P. falciparum and P. malariae transmission. The parasitological sporozoite index (SI) was 4.48% for A. gambiae and 4.22% for A. funestus. The immunological SIs were higher: 5.82% of A. gambiae were infected with P. falciparum and only 0.16% with P. malariae; the corresponding proportions for A. funestus were 6.45% and 0.41%. Transmission of Plasmodium spp. by A. gambiae was important during the rainy season (July-October) and by A. funestus at the beginning of the dry season (September-November). Each child in the study village could receive about 396 P. falciparum-infected bites per year but only 22 of P. malariae. The P. falciparum parasite indices were maximum during the middle of the rainy season (August), while those for P. malariae reached a peak during the dry season (February)."
CD008122,0,1343727,0,Molecular approaches to malaria and babesiosis diagnosis.,"The development of additional methods for detecting and identifying Babesia and Plasmodium infections may be useful in disease monitoring, management and control efforts. The preliminary evaluate synthetic peptide-based serodiagnosis, a hydrophilic sequence (DDESEFDKEK) was selected from the published BabR gene of B. bovis. Immunization of rabbits and cattle with the hemocyanin-conjugated peptide elicited antibody responses that specifically detected both P. falciparum and B. bovis antigens by immunofluorescence and Western blots. Using a dot-ELISA with this peptide, antisera from immunized and naturally-infected cattle, and immunized rodents, were specifically detected. Reactivity was weak and correlated with peptide immunization or infection. DNA-based detection using repetitive DNA was species-specific in dot-blot formats for B. bovis DNA, and in both dot-blot and in situ formats for P. falciparum; a streamlined enzyme-linked synthetic DNA assay for P. falciparum detected 30 parasites/mm3 from patient blood using either colorimetric (2-15 h color development) or chemiluminescent detection (0.5-6-min exposures). Serodiagnostic and DNA hybridization methods may be complementary in the respective detection of both chronic and acute infections. However, recent improvements in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) make feasible a more sensitive and uniform approach to the diagnosis of these and other infectious disease complexes, with appropriate primers and processing methods. An analysis of ribosomal DNA genes of Plasmodium and Toxoplasma identified Apicomplexa-conserved sequence regions. Specific and distinctive PCR profiles were obtained for primers spanning the internal transcribed spacer locus for each of several Plasmodium and Babesia species."
CD008122,0,9425385,0,Efficacy of tepid sponging versus paracetamol in reducing temperature in febrile children.,"A block randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of tepid sponging with the use of paracetamol in febrile children was undertaken at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre. Eighty children aged between 6 and 54 months with axillary temperatures of between > or = 38.5 degrees C and < or = 40 degrees C and a clinical diagnosis consistent with upper respiratory tract infection and/or malaria were block randomized to receive either oral paracetamol (15 mg/kg) or tepid sponging. Children receiving tepid sponging were sponged from head to toe (except the scalp) by leaving a thin layer of water on the body. If the body became dry it was repeated and continued until the axillary temperature fell to < 38.5 degrees C. Axillary temperature and assessment of discomfort (convulsions, crying, irritability, vomiting and shivering) were recorded every 30 minutes for 2 hours. A significantly greater and more rapid reduction of fever was demonstrated with paracetamol than with tepid sponging. Tepid sponging without antipyretics is often used to reduce fever, but our results suggest that this is effective only during the 1st 30 minutes. Paracetamol is clearly more effective than tepid sponging in reducing body temperature in febrile children in a tropical climate."
CD008122,0,1996736,0,Characteristics of natural antibody responses to the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium vivax.,"The antibody response to the prototype circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium vivax (CSPV) was studied in Thai soldiers experiencing occupational malaria. Seventy-four (65%) of 114 men followed during assignment to a malaria transmission area developed blood-stage infection with P. vivax. IgG antibodies against the central repeat region of the CSPV protein were quantitated by ELISA using the recombinant protein, NS181V20, as the capture antigen. One quarter of the subjects had detectable anti-CSPV antibodies at the beginning of the study. CSPV antibody seroconversion was documented in 16 of 26 subjects assessed during their first observed episodes of vivax malaria. This antibody response was of moderate magnitude, fell off after the first week post-diagnosis and appeared, at the low levels observed, to be unassociated with protection. Continued assessment of anti-CSPV antibody after subjects left the transmission area found no increase associated with release of P. vivax. These findings indicate that CS antibody responses to P. vivax during occupational malaria share many characteristics with responses to P. falciparum."

Eight months earlier, there had been transmission of P. vivax for a period of 50 days, which was then totally controlled by chemotherapy and insecticides. An anti-sporozoite response, measured by ELISA using a recombinant protein expressed in yeast, was detected in 45% (14 of 31) of individuals eight months after infection and persisted for 20 months in 12%. Eighteen individuals were treated prophylactically for malaria because they lived in houses in which an overt infection had occurred. Seven of these individuals were ELISA positive; of these, 5 had antibodies against the blood stage parasites. Among 13 other individuals in the endemic area who did not have positive smears, had not been ill, and had not received prophylaxis, five were anti-circumsporozoite positive up to a 40-fold serum dilution. They did not develop asexual blood stage antibodies and remained parasite-free for the following 20 months."

In tropical countries, tuberculosis, leprosy and, occasionally, malaria can produce clinical features similar to a vasculitic illness and all the three infections are known to be associated with auto antibodies. We tested 318 patients suffering from malaria, tuberculosis or leprosy for ANCA positivity. ANCA positivity was found in 19%, 32% and 30% of malaria, tuberculosis and leprosy patients (Pradhan V, Badakere S, Shankarkumar V, Iyer Y, Ghosh K, Karnad D, Indian J Malariol, 39:51-59, 2002; Pradhan V, Badakere S, Ghosh K, Pawar A, Indian J Med Sci, 58:283-288, 2004a; Pradhan V, Badakere S, Shankarkumar V, Lepr Rev, 75:50-56, 2004b), respectively, raising the possibility that ANCA positivity with clinical features suggestive of vasculitis in tropical countries may even be related to the background noise of this seropositivity caused by one of these three infections rather than confirming the diagnosis of paucicellular vasculitis. Hence, one should be careful about the background noise of ANCA positivity caused by these infections while diagnosing a vasculitic illness."
CD008122,0,10458637,0,Laser light scattering immunoassay for malaria.,Laser light scattering immunoassay (LIA) was proposed as a prospective diagnostic method for the detection of antibody (or antigen) by monitoring the agglutination of antigen (or antibody) coated carrier particles using dynamic light scattering (DLS) as probe. LIA is a very sensitive assay as it can detect microscopic immune complexes even when antibody (or antigen) level is low. A sizeable number of human sera collected from malaria endemic areas and hospitals have been analysed by ELISA using Pf parasite lysate or a RESA derived synthetic peptide as antigen parallel to LIA using Pf antigen coated polystyrene latex beads. Comparative analysis of data suggests LIA to be as good as ELISA and possibly better in terms of sensitivity and simplicity. LIA can be a simple and inexpensive immunoassay suitable for field use and mass application.
CD008122,0,11584652,0,[African Quin: results of a pragmatic study on the diagnosis of uncomplicated malaria attacks and treatment using quinine in French-speaking Africa].,"Management and treatment of disease do not always conform with official recommendations. African-quin is a pragmatic multicentric study carried out in 13 African countries to evaluate non-conformities in the management and treatment of uncomplicated malarial attacks using quinine. This study involved a total of 3,981 patients with documented uncomplicated malarial attacks diagnosed by 500 clinical physicians. Physicians were supplied with quinine tablets (125 mg et 500 mg Quinimax containing 125 mg and 500 mg of quinine base respectively) to allow treatment according to the dose recommendations of the WHO (24 mg/kg/day of quinine base). In 38% of the 3,981 patients, diagnosis was based on clinical findings without measurement of parasitemia. The median dose of Quinimax was 15.4 mg/kg/day in 3 intakes in 67% and 2 intakes in 33%. The dose was 23.2 mg/kg/day for patients under 12 years and 14.7 mg/kg/day for patients over 18 years (p < 0.001). Treatment lasted for at least 5 days in 62% of patients. Fever control was achieved within a mean delay of 3.9 +/- 1.5 days and was followed by a rapid decrease in clinical symptoms. Clinical control (normal temperature) was obtained in 96% of patients. The dose of Quinimax was the same regardless of whether treatment was a success or failure. The results of this study demonstrate the gap between official recommendations and everyday clinical practice and raise several important questions concerning the basis for decision-making, treatment goals, drug dosage, and treatment duration."
CD008122,0,18390603,0,A magneto-optic route toward the in vivo diagnosis of malaria: preliminary results and preclinical trial data.,"We report the development of magneto-optic technology for the rapid quantitative diagnosis of malaria that may also be realizable in a noninvasive format. Hemozoin, the waste product of malarial parasitic action on hemoglobin, is produced in a form that under the action of an applied magnetic field gives rise to an induced optical dichroism characteristic of the hemozoin concentration. Here we show that precise measurement of this induced dichroism may be used to determine the level of malarial infection because this correlates, albeit in a complex manner throughout the infection cycle, with the concentration of hemozoin in the blood and tissues of infected patients. Under conservative assumptions for the production of hemozoin as a function of parasitemia, initial results indicate that the technique can match or exceed other current diagnostic techniques. The validity of the approach is confirmed by a small preliminary clinical trial on 13 patients, and measurements on live parasitized cells obtained from in vitro culture verify the possibility of producing in vivo diagnostic instrumentation."
CD008122,0,7688346,0,Increased plasma levels of soluble ICAM-1 and ELAM-1 (E-selectin) during acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Acute P. falciparum malaria is associated with a loss of antigen-responsiveness of peripheral T cells, depletion of T cells characterized by high surface expression of the adhesion molecule LFA-1, and increased plasma levels of the T-cell activation marker soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R). In the present study we show that clinical episodes of P. falciparum malaria produced an increase in plasma levels of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) and ELAM-1 (sELAM-1). The increase was transient and subsided slowly (sICAM-1) or rapidly (sELAM-1) following drug cure. The increases in plasma sICAM-1 and sELAM-1 were significantly correlated, and were furthermore associated with a concomitant increase in plasma levels of sIL-2R. Finally, plasma levels of sICAM-1, but not sELAM-1, were inversely correlated to the fraction of peripheral T cells having high surface expression of LFA-1, the receptor for T-cell adhesion to ICAM-1. Taken together, these observations suggest that acute P. falciparum malaria is characterized by a state of endothelial inflammation associated with the adherence of activated T cells."
CD008122,0,15159369,0,Malaria.,"Malaria is a parasitic infection of global importance. Although relatively uncommon in developed countries, where the disease occurs mainly in travellers who have returned from endemic regions, it remains one of the most prevalent infections of humans worldwide. In endemic regions, malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and creates enormous social and economic burdens. Current efforts to control malaria focus on reducing attributable morbidity and mortality. Targeted chemoprophylaxis and use of insecticide-treated bed nets have been successful in some endemic areas. For travellers to malaria-endemic regions, personal protective measures and appropriate chemoprophylaxis can significantly reduce the risk of infection. Prompt evaluation of the febrile traveller, a high degree of suspicion of malaria, rapid and accurate diagnosis, and appropriate antimalarial therapy are essential in order to optimize clinical outcomes of infected patients. Additional approaches to malaria control, including genetic manipulation of mosquitoes and malaria vaccines, are areas of ongoing research."

CD008122,0,18202438,1,Update on rapid diagnostic testing for malaria.,"To help mitigate the expanding global impact of malaria, with its associated increasing drug resistance, implementation of prompt and accurate diagnosis is needed. Malaria is diagnosed predominantly by using clinical criteria, with microscopy as the current gold standard for detecting parasitemia, even though it is clearly inadequate in many health care settings. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been recognized as an ideal method for diagnosing infectious diseases, including malaria, in recent years. There have been a number of RDTs developed and evaluated widely for malaria diagnosis, but a number of issues related to these products have arisen. This review highlights RDTs, including challenges in assessing their performance, internationally available RDTs, their effectiveness in various health care settings, and the selection of RDTs for different health care systems."

CD008122,0,9373661,0,Semi-quantitative measurement of Plasmodium falciparum antigen PfHRP2 in blood and plasma.,"Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) antigen was measured semi-quantitatively in whole blood, plasma, and supernatants and red blood cells of cultures in vitro using the dipstick ParaSight-F test and also by a quantitative antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vitro, PfHRP2 was secreted mainly during the second half of the asexual cycle with a marked rise during schizont development and rupture. The total PfHRP2 secreted before schizogony corresponded to approximately 4% of that contained in the red blood cells. In samples from 55 patients with acute falciparum malaria, the level of detection by ELISA corresponded to parasitaemias of 100/microL for whole blood and 1600/microL for separated plasma. Whole blood PfHRP2 levels were correlated significantly with admission parasitaemia (r = 0.76, P < 0.0001) and the stage of parasite development (r = 0.43, P < 0.01). Although whole blood PfHRP2 concentrations were higher in severe malaria, plasma concentrations of PfHRP2 were considerably higher in severe malaria (median titre 1:320, range zero to 1:1280) than in uncomplicated malaria (median titre 1:5, range zero to 1:80; P < 0.0001). The ratio of whole blood to plasma PfHRP2 was lower in severe than in uncomplicated malaria (median 4, range 0.25 to 256, versus 64, range 4 to 1280; P < 0.0001). With plasma samples the intensity of colour change on the dipstick correlated well with more precise measurement of optical density in the ELISA (r = 0.88, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that measurement of PfHRP2 in plasma could provide an alternative approach to the assessment of the parasite biomass, and thus prognosis, in severe malaria, and that this could be done simply by using the currently available dipsticks."
CD008122,0,10203469,1,Detection and species determination of malaria parasites by PCR: comparison with microscopy and with ParaSight-F and ICT malaria Pf tests in a clinical environment.,"A rapid procedure for the diagnosis of malaria infections directly from dried blood spots by PCR amplification was evaluated with samples from 52 patients. Plasmodium infections were identified with a genus-specific primer set, and species differentiation between Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was analyzed by multiplex PCR. The PCR test with any of the three primer sets was able to detect as few as four parasites per microliter by gel electrophoresis or by nonisotopic paper hybridization chromatography. The diagnoses obtained by PCR correlated closely with those obtained by Giemsa staining except for two samples observed to have mixed P. falciparum-P. vivax infections. These were initially missed by microscopic analysis. In comparison with antigen-capture assays for P. falciparum, the PCR assays were able to detect three infections that were missed by the ParaSight-F test. The PCR test was negative for nine ParaSight-F-positive samples and one ICT Malaria Pf-positive sample, and these were confirmed to be false-positive results. The PCR thus gave no false-negative or false-positive results. Patients undergoing antimalarial therapy were also monitored by the PCR assay. Four of seven patients who were PCR positive for P. vivax at the time of discharge were later readmitted to the hospital with a recurrence of P. vivax infection. We would like to propose that PCR is a sensitive and easy method that can serve as a useful addition to microscopy for the diagnosis and the clinical monitoring of treatment of malaria."
CD008122,0,7851751,0,Enhanced expression of Plasmodium falciparum heat shock protein PFHSP70-I at higher temperatures and parasite survival.,"The effect of various body temperatures, encountered during malaria fever, on the synthesis of Plasmodium falciparum heat-shock protein called PFHSP70-I and parasite growth rates among five different isolates are described. The results show that after the exposure of parasites at 39 degrees C for 30 min the amount of PFHSP70-I in all five isolates increased markedly and significantly, whereas parasite growth rates and the amount of total blood stage antigens remained almost unaffected. This indicates that the PFHSP70-I gene responds to heat-shock by producing higher amounts of PFHSP70-I protein, presumably to protect the parasite from being killed during malaria fever."
CD008122,0,12211581,0,Inter-test reliability of the anti-RESA indices based on ELISA tests using eluates from whole blood spots dried on filter paper.,"The ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA), is one of the falciparum malaria vaccine candidates rarely studied in Brazil. Fieldwork logistics to conduct serology studies is simplified when eluates from whole blood dried on filter paper can be used. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the inter-test reliability for the anti-RESA ELISA-based indices using eluates from filter paper and from serum samples. The study population consisted of 210 individuals (Brazil) from whom matched samples were collected. Anti-RESA ELISA-based index means (+/- S.D.) were 15.29% (+/-28.13%) for filter paper and 11.79% (+/-23.67%) for serum samples. The intra-class correlation coefficient was estimated to be 82.38%, indicating high test reliability. However, there was a significant tendency for filter paper test results to have higher values than serum sample test results (P < 0.001). Explanations for this finding may be the presence of haemoglobin in the eluates from filter paper, which may interfere with ELISA testing."
CD008122,0,7542843,0,Antibodies to a Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage antigen as a tool for predicting the protection levels of two malaria-exposed populations.,"To evaluate the ability of antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (Pf155/RESA) epitopes to discriminate between individuals well protected or poorly protected against malaria, a receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed in two populations living in Madagascar and Malawi. The definition of protection was based on longitudinal measurements of clinical malarial attacks during the season of high malaria transmission in the Madagascar study, and on a cross-sectional measurement of parasitemia in the Malawi study. Antibodies to peptides reproducing the 4-mer, 8-mer, and 11-mer of the Pf155/RESA were tested for their reactivities using the Falcon assay screening test-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Maximal detection of poorly protected individuals (specificity = 100%) corresponded to high cutoff antibody titers (range = 1.65-3.0 optical density [OD] units in the Madagascar study and 0.67-1.42 OD units in the Malawi study) and a sensitivity less than 50%. For a given sensitivity of 50%, specificity ranged from 55% to 62% in the Madagascar study, and from 67% to 94% in the Malawi study. The antibody cutoff titers corresponding to minimal misclassification rates ranged from 0.24 to 1.73 OD units in the Madagascar study and from 0.15 to 0.55 OD units in the Malawi study. For each antibody, the highest detectability value as measured by the area under the curve was obtained for anti-R11 in the Malawi study (0.838). In demonstrating such qualities, antibodies to Pf155/RESA epitopes could be used for screening poorly protected populations in which malaria control programs have to be implemented."

CD008122,0,16884401,0,Application of insect repellents by travelers to malaria endemic areas.,"The use of insect repellents applied to the skin is always encouraged in those visiting malaria endemic areas. There are a number of factors contributing to the efficacy of insect repellents in the field and an important factor contributing to their longevity relates to the applied dose. This study investigated the dose of insect repellent that travelers might normally apply to the skin. Subjects were asked to apply a product they had purchased to the arms and neck, and the dose applied (mg/cm(2)) was calculated. The study was conducted using three different populations; 74 travelers to malaria endemic areas visiting pharmacies to purchase repellents before they left the UK, 23 travelers on safari in India, and 24 on safari in Kenya. There was a significant difference in the mean applied arm dose of product (mg/cm(2)) [p < 0.001, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]; UK 1.15 (SD 0.29), India 0.96 (SD 0.23), and Kenya 1.34 (SD 0.54). Higher concentrations were achieved on the neck area. Few of the participants in the field trial used long-sleeved shirts at night. Even using 50% wt/vol repellent products, 32% in the Kenya and 25% in the India, study achieved a dose of active ingredient less than 0.5 mg/cm(2). These pilot studies would indicate that travelers tend to apply below the optimal concentration of active ingredient of repellent as might be suggested by mathematical models."
CD008122,0,15772315,0,Short report: Rapid DNA extraction from archive blood spots on filter paper for genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum.,"The practical advantages of sampling and storing blood on filter paper for analyses of human and pathogen genes highlight the need for reliable, sensitive, and cost-effective DNA extraction methods. We describe a new Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer-based method for extraction of DNA from blood dried on filter paper. The method was evaluated against the commonly used methanol and Chelex methods, regarding polymerase chain reaction detection of Plasmodium falciparum parasites from samples stored for 1-2 years. The sensitivity of detection was dependent on the parasite density and type of filter paper. For 3MM Whatman filter paper, the sensitivity was 100%, 73%, and 93% for the TE, methanol, and Chelex methods, respectively. For the longer stored 903 Schleicher & Schuell filter paper, the sensitivity was 93%, 73%, and 0%, respectively. This rapid, simple, and inexpensive extraction method generated superior results from archived specimens compared with the two standard methods and may represent a useful tool in molecular epidemiologic studies."
CD008122,0,12214515,1,[Efficiency and specificity of the KAT-test for rapid diagnosis of falciparum malaria].,"A new rapid KAT Quick Malaria test for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria, which is based on the detection of a monoclonal antibody-antigen complex of malaria parasites, has been worked out by the KAT Medical CC in South Africa. The efficiency and specificity of the KAT test were compared with those of the microscopic method and with the ICT test for rapid diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax. The polymerase chain reaction was used as a control test. Testing for malaria was performed on 98 blood samples from feverish patients in Vietnam and Tadjikistan and among the persons who had returned to Moscow from endemic regions. The efficiency of the KAT test for falciparum-malaria was found to be 100% versus 90.5% with ICT. The absence of cross-reactions with P. vivax and the presence of pseudopositive results of the KAT test for fever cases of non-malaria origin indicate its high specificity. There was no correlation between the rate of test line colouring and the level of parasitemia. The KAT test yielded positive results only when gametocytes were found in blood specimens."

CD008122,0,2045836,0,Drug supply in Nigeria.,"The health situation in Nigeria is typical of tropical Africa. It is characterised by high childhood and maternal mortality and a relatively short life expectancy. Mortality in childhood in due mainly to diseases like malaria, measles, poliomyelitis, tetanus, diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections. Diseases like filariasis, schistosomiasis and leprosy which are now readily controlled by drugs cause considerable morbidity in later life. Although the technology and tools (particularly vaccines and drugs) for the control of most of these diseases are now available, it has not been possible to make optimal use of them in Nigeria and other tropical African countries because of unfavourable social and economic conditions. The non-availability of drugs most needed for healthcare and disease control has been found to be due not only to insufficient funds but also to the use of the limited funds on expensive drugs that have little bearing on the disease pattern. The Essential Drug Programme initiated by the World Health Organisation, now adopted by Nigeria and about 100 other countries mostly in the Third World, aims to correct this unsatisfactory drug supply situation by ensuring that the available funds are used to provide those drugs needed by the large majority of the people and are made available at all times at prices that most people can afford. The Bamako Initiative in the African Region of the World Health Organization is also designed to ensure regular availability of drugs particularly to primary healthcare facilities. Seed drugs are provided to the health institutions either by the National Government or through external aid. These are sold to patients at a small profit margin. The proceeds are then used to replenish stocks and the small profit used to improve services in the health centre. The introduction of these programmes in Nigeria has improved drug availability considerably in the past couple of years and should soon start yielding further dividend in the form of measurable improvement in the health situation."

CD008122,0,11548307,0,[Armenia: implementation of national program of malaria control].,"Malaria has been existing in Armenia since antiquity. In the 1920""s to 1930s, thousands of people suffered from this disease in the country. Enormous efforts were required to prevent further spread of the disease. A network was set up, which consisted of a research institute and stations. A total of 200,000 cases of malaria were still notified in 1934. Rapid development of the health infrastructure and better socioeconomic conditions improved the malaria situation and reduced the number of cases in 1946. Malaria was completely eradicated in Armenia in 1963, and the malaria-free situation retained till 1994. During that period, comprehensive activities were undertaken in the country to prevent and control malaria. Since 1990, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the situation became critical in many newly independent states. Economic crisis, human migration, worsening levels of health services, and the lack of necessary medicines, equipment, and insecticides significantly affected the malaria epidemiological situation in the country. Malaria cases started to penetrate into Armenia from neighboring countries. In 1994, a hundred ninety six military men contacted malaria in Karabakh, which was unfavorable in terms of malaria, as well on as the border with Iran and along the Araks river. The first cases recorded in Armenia were imported, afterwards they led to the incidence of indigenous cases, given the fact that all the prerequisites for malaria mosquito breeding and development were encountered in 17 regions and 3 towns of the country. In 1995, there were 502 imported cases and in 1996 the situation changed: out of 347 registered cases, 149 were indigenous. The Ministry of Health undertook a range of preventive measures. In 1997 versus 1996, the total number of malaria cases increased 2.3-fold: 841 registered cases of which 567 were indigenous (a 3.8-fold increase). The overwhelming majority of cases were recorded in the Ararat and Armavir marzes. In 1998, there were a total of 1156 cases, of them 542 being locally contacted. The situation became stable thanks to joint efforts of WHO, IFRX, the Armenian Red Cross Society, UNICEF, the Ministry of Health of Armenia and its Government. Under Minister's Decree No. 292 of May 17, 1999, a malaria project implementation office was established in the Masis Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance Center of Hygienic and Antiepidemic Surveillance to improve progress of the malaria control programme in Armenia. WHO allocated some 7,700 USD for 5-month maintenance and work of the office. Thus, analyzing the malaria cases registered in 1999 and 1998 indicates a 1.9-fold decrease (616/77). The setting up the malaria programme field office under the Minister's decree was instrumental in planning and implementing activities in situ. In 1999, four cases of tropical malaria were recorded in Armenia. The patients were Armenian pilots who contacted malaria during duty travels: 1 in Sudan and 3 in Congo. The list of pilots making flying to endemic countries was submitted to the Republican Center to implement preventive measures in the future. In Armenia malaria surveillance has been improved to ensure timely detection of all suspected cases and to carry out malaria control activities. In this regard, a seminar was held for 21 entomologists and 12 parasitologists. UNICEF and WHO Armenian offices provided a substantial support to organize seminars. To facilitate the seminars, the manual ""Malaria parasitology and entomology"" was published and distributed among their participants. On April 19, 1999, the session of the Ministry's Executive Board (Collegium) gave recommendations to reinforce malaria control activities in the country. Decrees No. 256 of May 31, 1999, No. 47 of May 29, 1999, and No. 245 of April 30, 1999, ""On malaria and preventive and control activities"" were issued by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security to serve as a guideline for planning and implementing activities. The Ministry of Agriculture undertook to clean the collective irrigation (drainage) system covering 102 and 77 km in the Ararat and Armavir marzes, the Ministry of Health provided a list of endemic foci where cleaning was a priority. Taking into account the importance of the people's participation in ensuring effective prevention and control, emphasis was laid on health education activities: publication of leaflets, as well as articles in local newspapers, radio broadcasts and TV shows. Throughout the season, the early detection of malaria cases, timely hospitalization (in no later than 1-3 days) for at least 5 days and subsequent treatment under direct supervision of a physician were successfully carried out due to home-to-home visits. Entomological studies conducted in the malaria foci show an increase in the presence and density of a malaria vector in the buildings. As far as treatment is concerned, the overall surface of stagnant waters comprised 2642 ha in 1999 (2733 ha in 1998), including 1285 ha of anophelogenic stagnant waters (2276 ha in 1998). The biggest stagnant water surfaces were in the Ararat and Armavir marzes--2209 ha, where the majority of malaria cases were recorded. A total of 1,283,111 and 559,213 sq. m. of constructions were treated in 1999 and 1998, respectively, out them there were 1,259,637 sq. m. in 5 endemic regions. Stagnant water surfaces were treated with bacticulicides on 250.7 and 743.8 (almost 3 times more) in 1998 and 1999, respectively. In 1999, 740 ha of surface were biologically treated using Gambusia compared to 900 ha treated in 1998. There is no highly qualified diagnostic specialists in many regions of the country, which necessitates the holding of further seminars involving relevant specialists, in all malaria regions. There is a tendency of geographical spread of malaria: malaria cases occur in new regions and dwellings. A country-wide action plan was drafted for 2000, mainly focusing on staff training. With WHO assistance, a seminar was held for 324 specialists from endemic regions. During the first quarter of 2000, 13 cases of tertian malaria were recorded as compared 59 cases during the same period of last year. All these patients contacted malaria in the previous season and demonstrated long incubation periods. Thus, the malaria control plan recommended by WHO and the rational and targeted use of its assistance has shown a 2-fold decrease in the incidence of malaria."

CD008122,0,18513771,1,Point-of-care testing for malaria outbreak management.,"A rapid antigen assay for malaria was performed on blood samples collected during a simultaneous outbreak of falciparum malaria and vivax malaria on a remote island in the Indonesian archipelago. During the outbreak, a total of 89 patients (4.3% of the population) were diagnosed with malaria within a week. Microscopic examination revealed 78 malaria slide-positive cases, of whom 49 (62.8%) were identified as P. falciparum, 7 (9.0%) as P. vivax and 22 (28.2%) as mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax infections. The rapid malaria assay showed excellent correlation with expert-confirmed routine microscopy for P. falciparum and P. vivax monoinfections and mixed infections with a parasite density >50 parasites/microl. Several slide-negative blood samples collected from febrile patients with clinical malaria tested positive in the rapid test. The estimated sensitivity calculated for the rapid test (91.0%) was slightly higher than that of microscopy (87.6%). The result indicates that rapid antigen detection for malaria could be a useful alternative to microscopy to reduce the workload during emergency outbreak situations."
CD008122,0,19434070,0,Moving candidate vaccines into development from research: lessons from HIV.,"There is a logarithmic increase in the cost and complexity of the research and development process when transitioning a promising candidate vaccine from the laboratory into the clinic. Managing complex development programs involving people from diverse technical, cultural and geographical backgrounds is a specialised skill. It is essential that the group is clear on their objectives and how their activities affect others, that communication is open, inclusive and effective, and that the most rigorous, scientific approach based on statistical principles in compliance with regulatory requirements is used. Applying these standards to all vaccine development programs will filter out inappropriate candidates more readily and enhance the efficiency of vaccine development. The challenges of developing a new vaccine are illustrated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccinology. Selecting vaccine candidates for HIV requires the ability to evaluate the large number of potential antigens in imperfect and non-standardised animal models. Further, using these models to evaluate questions such as dose scaling to humans, optimal route of administration, the use of adjuvants and potential formulation improvements adds variable to variable, making the interpretation of results particularly challenging. This may lead to the promotion of a poor candidate or the elimination of a good one. The absence of precise immunological correlates of protection and the prohibitive cost of confirmatory clinical trials are further significant barriers. However, there are practical steps that can be taken to standardise early vaccine evaluation, which would result in more efficient development of new vaccines for HIV and other disease areas with similarly challenging development issues (such as hepatitis C virus, influenza, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and malaria)."
CD008122,0,9574783,0,IgG3 antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2): increasing prevalence with age and association with clinical immunity to malaria.,"In a cross-sectional survey carried out in west Africa (The Gambia), where Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic with seasonal transmission, 178 individuals 1-75 years of age were assessed for their antibody response to the malaria vaccine candidate, merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2). Total IgG to recombinant antigens representing full-length, repetitive, and group-specific domains of both allelic families of MSP2 was determined by ELISA. The IgG-subclass profile of IgG-positive sera was assessed. Antibody prevalence was age-dependent, reaching a peak during adolescence. In MSP2-seropositive individuals, there was a predominance of cytophilic antibodies (IgG1 and IgG3); IgG1 antibodies were prevalent in children less than 10 years of age, whereas in adolescents and adults MSP2-specific antibodies were predominantly IgG3. In parallel, we conducted a longitudinal study of children (3-8 years of age) from the same community; sera collected before the malaria transmission season were tested for the presence of anti-MSP2 antibodies. The subsequent susceptibility of these children to clinical malaria was monitored and the association between anti-MSP2 antibodies of different IgG subclasses and resistance to clinical malaria was tested. The presence of IgG3 antibodies to MSP2 serogroup A was negatively associated with the risk of clinical malaria whereas IgG1 antibodies to MSP2 serogroup B were associated with an increased risk of clinical infection. Our data suggest that age/exposure-related acquisition of IgG3 antibodies to MSP2 may contribute to the development of clinically protective immunity to malaria."

CD008122,0,2128922,0,[Detection of circulating antigen in schistosomiasis by dot-ELISA with monoclonal antibody].,"Circulating antigen in sera from acute, chronic and late stages of schistosomiasis patients was detected by direct dot-ELISA with monoclonal antibody 3D8A against schistosome gut-associated cathodic antigen linked with peroxidase, the positive rates being 90.6%, 83.2% and 30.7%, respectively. No positive reactions were found with sera from patients of clonorchiasis, malaria and non-parasitic diseases. The positive rate and the circulating antigen level in EPG greater than 100 group of patients were found to be higher than those in EPG less than 100 group. Circulating antigen became negative one year after praziquantel treatment in 84.0% of patients who showed negative fecal examination, while the other patients remained positive with decreasing titers. The results indicated that the circulating antigen in sera from schistosomiasis patients of various stages can be detected by dot-ELISA with monoclonal antibody 3D8A against circulating schistosome gut-associated cathodic antigen. The authors concluded that the circulating antigen level was correlated with the intensity of infection and the efficacy of treatment."
CD008122,0,10810570,0,Blood meal identification by using Microdot ELISA in vector mosquitoes.,"The blood meals of five mosquito species which are vectors for malaria, J.E. and Filaria were determined by using Microdot ELISA technique, which is a rapid and sensitive method. A total of 4354 freshly fed mosquitoes comprising of Anopheles culicifacies, An stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. vishnui gp. and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were tested. Results of the study reveal that highest proportion of An. culicifacies between 76-100% fed on bovine host followed by 0.3 to 24.2% on human. Cx. vishnui showed 1.9% feeding on human, 49-87.7% on bovine and 7.4-12.3% on the pigs. It has been observed that malaria vectors namely An. culicifacies and An. stephensi are still zoophilic in nature. Similarly, the vector of J.E. namely Culex vishnui gp. and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus also fed on cattle but some samples have indicated feeding of blood meal from pigs."
CD008122,0,2181384,0,Consecutive determinations of seroreactivities to Pf 155/RESA antigen and to its different repetitive sequences in adult men from a holoendemic area of Liberia.,"Sera from 32 adult men residing in a malaria holoendemic area of Liberia were investigated for seroreactivities to different asexual blood-stage malaria antigens on five consecutive occasions from 1984 to 1986. The seroreactivities to crude parasitic antigens and to Pf 155/RESA (EMIF) were determined by immunofluorescence and to repetitive sequences of Pf 155/RESA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All sera were highly reactive against the crude parasitic antigens with reciprocal titres varying from 5000 to 100,000. The EMIF titres showed a wider variation from negative (less than 10) to 25,000, and when the same individuals were re-examined on subsequent surveys similar EMIF titres were found. The ELISA seroreactivities to three different repetitive sequences of Pf 155/RESA also showed different individual profiles which were rather consistent on consecutive surveys. High EMIF titres appeared to be correlated mainly to one of the peptide sequences, namely (EENV)2. The consistent individual profiles of the seroreactivities to Pf 155 and its repetitive sequences suggest genetic restriction of the humoral immune response. Although no significant correlation was found between EMIF titres and parasitic densities in the adult hyperimmune men the specific peptides, however, offer new possibilities of further investigating protective capacities of different immune responses to specific epitopes of the malaria parasite."
CD008122,0,11129700,0,Diversion of Anopheles gambiae from children to other hosts following exposure to permethrin-treated bednets.,"Permethrin-treated bednets reduce mortality and morbidity from malaria in Gambian children. However, it is not certain how this effect is achieved, as neither mosquito numbers nor the human blood index of indoor-resting female Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu lato (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes have been reduced when treated bednets were introduced into a community. One possibility is that insecticide-treated bednets divert mosquitoes from children to adults. To investigate this hypothesis, a cross-over trial with insecticide-treated bednets was undertaken in two small Gambian villages. To differentiate mosquitoes that had fed on children from those that had fed on adults, all children in the study villages were immunized with rabies vaccine before the trial. Using the detection of rabies antibody in a bloodmeal as an indicator that a mosquito had bitten a child, it was found that the percentage of blood-fed mosquitoes caught indoors that had bitten a child fell significantly from 30.8% to 9.2% and from 28.0% to 6.9% in each village after insecticide-treated bednets were introduced. To investigate the possibility that some diversion to animals had occurred, a PCR analysis for human beta-globin DNA was undertaken on selected samples. The results of this investigation were confusing, as some rabies-antibody positive bloodmeals were negative for human DNA. This may have been due to cross-reacting antibodies in animal sera and/or DNA degradation by digestion in the mosquito. Although good evidence for diversion of mosquitoes away from children was obtained, it remains uncertain whether diversion was mainly to adult humans, to animals or to both."
CD008122,0,10936578,0,Malaria in São Tomé and Príncipe: parasite prevalences and vector densities.,"A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 16 localities on the island of São Tomé and three on the island of Príncipe, at the end of the rainy season of 1997, to determine malaria prevalence and vector densities. Blood samples from 664 inhabitants of all ages were examined by optical microscopy (OM) and PCR. Mosquito collections were made by outdoor landing captures from 21:00-23:00 h. Great differences were found between OM and PCR readings. OM had a sensitivity of 66%, a specificity of 79% and failed to reveal any mixed-infections. Overall prevalence, determined by PCR, was higher in São Tomé (53%) than in Príncipe (35%). It was highest in children below 16 years-old. All four human Plasmodium species occurred in São Tomé but P. ovale was not detected in Príncipe. The human population was largely asymptomatic. Bednet users had lower prevalence than did non-users. The FOREST form of Anopheles gambiae s.s., identified by PCR and cytogenetics, was the only vector on the islands. The sporozoite rate in São Tomé, assessed by ELISA, was 0.5%. Parasite prevalence and vector densities were positively correlated in São Tomé, where malaria transmission must occur predominantly in the more populated coastal areas."
CD008122,0,7044589,0,Diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection in man: detection of parasite antigens by ELISA.,"An ELISA method has been developed for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection in man. Parasites from in vitro cultures of P. falciparum were used as source of antigen for the solid phase and the source of specific antibody was immune Gambian sera; binding of antibody in antigen-coated wells was registered by means of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-human IgG. Parasites were detected on the basis of inhibition of antibody-binding. The test was applied to the detection of parasites in human red blood cells (RBC) from in vitro cultures of P. falciparum and in RBC from infected Gambians; RBC from 100 Geneva blood donors served as normal, uninfected controls. In titration experiments, the degree of antibody-binding inhibition correlated with the number of parasites in the test RBC. Parasites were detected at a level of 8 parasites/10(6) RBC. Samples of RBC were tested from 126 Gambians with microscopically proven infection; significant antibody-binding inhibition was found in 86% of these cases, where parasitaemia ranged from 10 to 125 000/mul of blood. The presence of high-titre antibody in the test preparations was found to reduce the sensitivity of parasite detection in infected RBC from in vitro cultures mixed with equal volumes of different antibody-containing sera. The sensitivity was restored in most cases by recovering the RBC by centrifugation before testing. In a preliminary experiment, there was no significant difference in antibody-binding inhibition using fresh infected RBC and RBC dried on filter-paper and recovered by elution, although there was greater variation in the latter samples."
CD008122,0,11904103,1,A comparison of two rapid field immunochromatographic tests to expert microscopy in the diagnosis of malaria.,"In Myanmar, we tested two rapid malaria immunochromatographic kits: the OptiMAL assay for the detection of parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), and the ICT Malaria P.f./P.v. test for histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and panmalarial antigens. A total of 229 patients were examined, of whom 133 were found to be malaria positive by Giemsa microscopy. Both OptiMAL and ICT gave lower sensitivities than previously reported. ICT sensitivity for Plasmodium falciparum and non-falciparum parasites were 86.2 and 2.9%, respectively; specificity was 76.9 and 100%, respectively. OptiMAL sensitivity for P. falciparum and non-falciparum parasites were 42.6 and 47.1%, respectively; specificity was 97.0 and 96.9%, respectively. The sensitivity of both tests for the detection of both P. falciparum and non-falciparum parasites increased with parasite density. Several explanations for these results are explored. Our results raise particular concern over batch quality variations of malaria rapid diagnostic devices (MRDDs)."
CD008122,0,19562032,0,Rapid assessment of malaria transmission using age-specific sero-conversion rates.,"Malaria transmission intensity is a crucial determinant of malarial disease burden and its measurement can help to define health priorities. Rapid, local estimates of transmission are required to focus resources better but current entomological and parasitological methods for estimating transmission intensity are limited in this respect. An alternative is determination of antimalarial antibody age-specific sero-prevalence to estimate sero-conversion rates (SCR), which have been shown to correlate with transmission intensity. This study evaluated SCR generated from samples collected from health facility attendees as a tool for a rapid assessment of malaria transmission intensity."
CD008122,0,8745934,0,Detection of anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies directed against a repetitive peptide of the gametocyte antigen Pfs2400 in malaria patients in Brazil.,"Sera collected from 164 individuals who had clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria and came from several areas of Brazil where malaria is endemic were tested for the presence of anti-gametocyte antibodies. Antibodies directed against P. falciparum gametocytes were detected, by IFAT, in the sera of 67.1% of these patients. The prevalence of these antibodies was significantly higher in patients who had undergone multiple attacks of malaria than in those who were experiencing their first attack at the time of serum collection. Although circulating gametocytes were detected in 22% of the patients at this time, there was no difference in the percentages of IFAT positivity between apparent gametocyte 'carriers' and 'non-carriers'. All sera were also tested by ELISA, using a dimer of the nonamer peptide [PEE(L/V)VEEV(I/V)]2, which represents a tandem consensus repeat of the P. falciparum gametocyte antigen, Pfs2400, a target of transmission-blocking antibodies. ELISA demonstrated that 32.9% of the patients had antibodies that reacted with this peptide. Positive ELISA reactions were significantly more frequent amongst the sera of patients who had had multiple malaria attacks than in those undergoing their first malaria episode; positivity was lower in the gametocyte 'carriers' than in their 'non-carriers'. These results demonstrate that anti-gametocyte antibodies, which have already been shown to have potential transmission-blocking activity, are naturally elicited in Brazilian patients, the highest rates of seropositivity occurring after multiple malaria attacks."
CD008122,0,12804841,0,Serum antibodies induced by intranasal immunization of mice with Plasmodium vivax Pvs25 co-administered with cholera toxin completely block parasite transmission to mosquitoes.,"Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) targeting ookinete surface proteins expressed on sexual-stage malaria parasites are considered one promising strategy for malaria control. To evaluate the prospect of developing non-invasive and easy-to-administer mucosal malaria transmission-blocking vaccines, mice were immunized intranasally with a Plasmodium vivax ookinete surface protein, Pvs25 with a mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin (CT). Immunization induced significant serum IgG with high IgG1/IgG2a ratio (indicative of Th-2 type immune response). Feeding Anopheles dirus mosquitoes with mixtures of immune sera and gametocytemic blood derived from vivax-infected volunteer patients in Thailand significantly reduced both the number of midgut oocysts as well as the percentage of infected mosquitoes. The observed transmission-blocking effect was dependent on immune sera dilution. This study demonstrates for the first time that the mucosally induced mouse immune sera against a human malaria ookinete surface protein can completely block parasite transmission to vector mosquitoes, suggesting the possibility of non-invasive mucosal vaccines against mucosa-unrelated important pathogens like malaria."
CD008122,0,9625927,0,Clinical pharmacology and malaria.,"The role of clinical pharmacology in improving the prevention and treatment of malaria is reviewed. A series of general and specific issues is discussed, concentrating on risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness. The techniques of clinical pharmacokinetics play an important role in the optimal use of drugs and this is illustrated by studies on quinine and proguanil. In discussing amodiaquine toxicity, the role of the pharmacologist and the chemist in designing out drug toxicity lends hope for producing a new generation of antimalarial drugs."
CD008122,0,9231194,1,Comparative evaluation of four techniques for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infections.,"Four diagnostic techniques for Plasmodium falciparum infection were evaluated against serial parasite dilutions and on identical field samples. These were (i) Giemsa-stained thick blood films (GTF), (ii) acridine orange-stained thick (AOTF) and thin (AOTnF) blood films, (iii) the quantitative buffy coat technique (QBC); and (iv) the ParaSight-F dipstick test (PS). PS had a consistently higher sensitivity and speed, was easiest to learn, and required no laboratory facility. The 100% sensitivity cut-off points against known parasite densities (per mm3) were: PS, 30; GTF, 84; QBC, 84; AOTnF, 84; AOTF, 149. In the field study, test sensitivities compared with examination of 800 microscope fields of a Giemsa-stained thin blood film were PS, 96.6%; AOTF, 93.1%; GTF, 91.4%; QBC, 89.7%; AOTnF, 82.8%. In the dilution study, one false positive result was recorded with QBC; in the field study there was one false positive each with PS, AOTnF and AOTF. When a newly trained microscopist examined samples of the parasite dilutions, the 100% sensitivity cut-off points were AOTF, 84; GTF, 140; QBC, 390. Total handling time was shortest with PS regardless of whether samples were processed individually or in batches of 10 or 100. The ParaSight-F test is recommended as the diagnostic tool for the future."

The mosquitoes were desiccated and stored in silicon chambers from 3 mo to 3 yr post-collection prior to being assayed using a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect Plasmodium vivax predominant-type sporozoite protein. Peridomicile-collected mosquitoes had a 10-fold higher sporozoite rate than those collected indoors, but only the latter correlate significantly with the seasonal human parasite index. Mosquito sporozoite burden was also significantly higher in the peridomicile-collected population."

The coincidence rate with this test was 93% with microscopically confirmed P. vivax cases, 97% with normal samples, 95% with microscopically negative fever cases from nonendemic areas and 86% from endemic areas, respectively. The sensitivity was greater than 1 parasite/10(5) RBC."
CD008122,0,9135668,0,Monoclonal antibodies against lactate dehydrogenase of Plasmodium knowlesi.,"Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of malarial parasites has been demonstrated to be biochemically and immunochemically distinct from the equivalent host enzyme. The polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified plasmodial LDH showed specificity to Plasmodium spp. Six hybridoma cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies specific to Plasmodium knowlesi LDH have been obtained. The two monoclonal antibodies (2A3B7 and 4A6A7) showed high reactivity with LDH from simian (P. knowlesi. P. cynomolgi), human (P. falciparum, P. vivax) and rodent (P. berghei, P. yoelii) malarial parasites and did not cross-react with red cell LDH as well as with isoenzymic forms of mammalian LDH (A4, B4 and C4). One monoclonal antibody (4A6A7) strongly inhibited the enzyme activity specifically of plasmodial LDH and did not have any effect on the activity of red cell LDH. The other monoclonal (2A3B7) did not show inhibitory effect on parasite LDH. These findings as well as competitive immunoassay studies suggest the presence of at least two parasite specific epitopes on plasmodial LDH."
CD008122,0,11358000,1,Use of the Parasight-F diagnostic test for imported malaria in a travel clinic.,The Parasight-F test based on the detection of a soluble antigen specific for Plasmodium falciparum is designed for the immediate diagnosis of malaria infection. We evaluated its use by clinicians during consultations. This prospective study of its diagnostic utility in febrile patients consulting a travel clinic on their return from areas endemic for malaria was conducted between May 1996 and May 1997. The Parasight-F test was performed by the clinician with confirmation by means of standard microscopic examination of venous blood. One-hundred and forty patients were enrolled. Forty-three (31%) cases of malaria were identified by microscopic examination. Thirty-eight were due to P. falciparum. The Parasight-F tests yielded 6 false-positive and 3 false-negative results compared to the microscopic findings. The specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria were 94% and 92%. These results show that the Parasight-F test alone cannot replace microscopic diagnosis of malaria in travel clinics.
CD008122,0,10192710,0,Randomised study of the possible adjuvant effect of BCG vaccine on the immunogenicity of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine in Senegalese infants.,"Following a study in Senegal (1990-1995) in which the relative efficacy of a diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) was compared with that of a diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis vaccine in children given a simultaneous injection of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, this subsequent study was conducted to evaluate the possible adjuvant effect of the BCG vaccine on acellular pertussis vaccine components. A second objective was to compare the immunogenicity of these components when administered in accordance with a 2-4-6-month (spaced) schedule or an accelerated 2-3-4-month schedule. In all, 390 healthy Senegalese infants were randomly divided into three groups of 130 infants. Antibodies to acellular pertussis components were measured in serum samples obtained within 2 days of the first DTaP dose and 1 month after the third dose. BCG vaccine, given simultaneously with the DTaP vaccine, did not influence the immunogenicity of the acellular pertussis vaccine components when compared with separate administration of the two vaccines. Infants immunised according to a 2-4-6-month schedule had a significantly higher immune response than those immunised according to a 2-3-4-month schedule with respect to the response to pertussis toxoid assessed by seroneutralisation on Chinese hamster ovary cells (P<0.0001). These results suggest that BCG and DTaP vaccines can be given simultaneously without interference or enhancement and that more optimal immunogenicity is achieved with an extended than with an accelerated schedule."
CD008122,0,7974687,0,"Difficulties of interpreting PPD reactions of women living in Madang, Papua New Guinea.","Malaria surveys in Madang, Papua New Guinea, previously distinguished 2 populations of women with significantly different spleen rates and immune responses to malaria. Differences between the high (HS) and low (LS) spleen rate groups suggested a defect in cellular immunity in the HS group. This paper reports a survey of purified protein derivative (PPD) responses in a sample of HS and LS women. Eighty-eight of 162 women were PPD positive (reaction size > 5 mm). There was a marked difference in the range and size of PPD reaction between the HS and LS groups. Mean size in the LS group was 20.7 mm and in the HS group it was 12.1 mm (P = 0.02). Failure to show differences in other indicators of specific malaria immunity indicated that the difference in PPD response was not the result of malaria-specific cell-mediated immune suppression. Many women were PPD non-responders in spite of evidence of multiple bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination scars. There was no difference between HS and LS groups in the level of non-response to PPD. The results confirm an early tuberculosis survey indicating that New Guineans rapidly lose PPD reactivity to BCG vaccination. Ability to maintain a PPD response, and the quality of response, may vary according to sex and genetic background."

Sera from children aged three to eight years who suffered clinical symptoms of malaria, or were partially immune with an asymptomatic infection, and from adults all living in The Gambia, West Africa were tested. The results suggest that the antibody response to MSP-1(19) has a role in naturally-acquired immunity in Gambian individuals."

CD008122,0,7038477,0,Growth of human malaria parasites in biotinylated erythrocytes.,"The adaptation of the biotin-avidin system for the analysis of membrane pathobiology in Plasmodium falciparum malaria is described. Biotin was linked covalently via the succinimide ester derivative (biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, BNHS) to intact human erythrocytes, prior to inoculation and in vitro cultivation of falciparum parasites. Growth experiments indicated that incubation concentrations of less than 1.0 mg BNHS/1.0 ml erythrocyte packed cell volume could yield biotinylated erythrocytes capable of sustaining parasite growth at levels comparable to control cultures. Using a synthesized [14C]BNHS compound at optimal incubation concentration, it was determined that 1.32 X 10(-4) mmol [14C]BNHS were bound per 1.0 mg of erythrocyte stromal protein. In addition, analysis of [14C]biotinylated red blood cell ghost preparations by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that band 3 (a heterogeneous glycoprotein) was the principal site of membrane labeling. Approximately 77% of total membrane-associated [14C]BNHS was localized to this polypeptide. The unique properties of the specific, ligand-protein interaction of the biotin-avidin complex suggest that the biotinylation procedure described in this report will provide a useful analytical tool in host cell-plasmodial parasite, membrane studies."
CD008122,0,11791998,0,Natural human immunoglobulin G subclass responses to Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen in Uganda.,"Serum samples from Ugandan residents of a malaria-hyperendemic region were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for reactivity against recombinant constructs of the 47 (SE47')- and 50 (SE50A)-kDa fragments of Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen (SERA). Immunoglobulin (Ig) G3 and IgG1 were the predominant subclass responses to SE47' and SE50A, respectively. The geometric mean optical density (OD) for IgG3 anti-SE47' was significantly lower in children < 15 years compared with adults > or = 15 years (P < 0.0001). By contrast, the geometric mean IgG1 anti-SE50A was slightly higher in children compared with adults (P < 0.01). The proportion of high responders (ODs > 0.5) to SE47' was significantly lower in children compared with adults (P < 0.001), whereas the proportion of high responders to SE50A was comparable in children and adults (P = 0.07). This first detailed study of SERA in a malaria-hyperendemic region suggests that natural human IgG3 anti-SE47' might be associated with immunity to malaria."
CD008122,0,16124417,1,Rapid immunochromatography-based detection of mixed-species malaria infection in Pakistan.,"We report the identification of mixed Plasmodium infections in four recent patients with malaria clinically refractory to empiric chloroquine therapy using the rapid antigen detection kit, NOW ICT Malaria Pf/Pv. A rapid in vitro immunodiagnostic test, the NOW ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test kit was used for the detection of circulating Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) antigens in whole blood. Peripheral blood microscopy confirmed mixed-species infection in all the cases. Thick and thin peripheral blood films were made and stained with Giemsa stain and examined by both hospital laboratory staff and an experienced parasitologist who was blinded to the results of the rapid malarial antigen tests. Four recent patients (all male; mean age, 24 years) with mixed malarial infection were identified. All the subjects were males working for an oil company in a coastal area of Pakistan, and all had been diagnosed presumptively with malaria based on clinical grounds (without microbiologic confirmation), and were treated empirically with chloroquine without clinical response. Semiquantitative malaria counts via microscopy were as follows: P. vivax, scanty (2 patients) and moderate (2 patients); for P. falciparum--scanty (1 patient), moderate (2 patients), and heavy (1 patient). The present case series, although limited by the small number of patients with proven mixed P. falciparum-P. vivax infection, highlights the usefulness of the rapid antigen test in a highly malarious region of Pakistan where chloroquine resistance is prevalent. Although there was full concordance between the results of blood smear microscopy and rapid antigen testing, these techniques are potentially most useful when there is a discrepancy with microscopy findings. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of parasites, particularly in cases of mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax infection, is of immense importance for individual patient management and in reducing the burden of disease, especially in regions of chloroquine resistance."
CD008122,0,16124416,1,Field evaluation of malaria rapid diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and non-P. falciparum infections.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate various malaria rapid diagnostic tests as a tool in the detection of P. falciparum and non-P. falciparum infections in field conditions. Four field surveys were conducted in malaria-endemic areas of Palawan and Davao del Norte, Philippines to validate the various rapid diagnostic tests, namely Diamed OptiMAL 48 (DiaMed AG, Switzerland), ParaHIT f (Span Diagnostics, India), Orchid OptiMAL, and Paracheck Pf (both from Orchid Biomedical Systems, India). The results of the various rapid diagnostic tests were compared to those of microscopy. Sensitivity, specificity and detection rates according to the level of parasitemia were used as parameters to describe the performance of the various rapid diagnostic tests in the field. Practical and operational assessments were also done. The results of the study show that the sensitivity and detection rates were generally lower than previously reported, with sensitivities ranging from 4.8% to 20.6%, except for Diamed OptiMAL 48, which had sensitivities of 78.8% to 96.8%, and detection rates of 50.0% to 96.8%. The rest had detection rates ranging from 0.0% to 50.0%. All the specificities ranged from 18.2% to 100.0%. Improper conditions at the time of manufacturing, storage, transport, and utilization may affect the validity of the results. Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria provide practical means of detecting malarial infections, especially in endemic areas. However, issues regarding variability in performance must to be addressed before they can be used as mainstream diagnostic tools."
CD008122,0,18710559,0,Dry season ecology of Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes in The Gambia.,"Malaria in The Gambia is highly seasonal, with transmission occurring as Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations expand during and immediately after a single annual rainy season that lasts from June to October. There has been very limited investigation of the ecology of vectors during the dry season, when numbers are very limited and distributions may be restricted."
CD008122,0,9142799,0,Temporal association between serum gelsolin levels and clinical events in a patient with severe falciparum malaria.,"Actin is present in high concentrations in most eukaryotic cells and can polymerize into filaments under physiological buffer conditions. As a result of tissue injury and cell lysis, large quantities of actin are released locally and may obstruct the downstream microvasculature, causing further damage to already injured organs. It has been postulated that this mechanism contributes to the development of the adult respiratory distress syndrome and to the diverse complications of falciparum malaria. Actin scavenging proteins--e.g., gelsolin--counteract the effects of extracellular actin, but the capacity of these plasma proteins can be overwhelmed by massive tissue injury. We examined the temporal relationship between serum levels of gelsolin (and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and the clinical findings for a patient with severe falciparum malaria. The level of gelsolin decreased and then increased as the patient's status first worsened and then improved. We could not determine whether gelsolin served a biologically important function in this patient's recovery or was simply an epiphenomenon of disease activity. Gelsolin levels may be an early prognostic indicator in patients with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Moreover, the potential therapeutic role of recombinant human plasma gelsolin in patients with delayed organ dysfunction that commonly follows a self-limited initial insult merits investigation."
CD008122,0,8653815,1,A rapid dipstick antigen capture assay for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria. WHO Informal Consultation on Recent Advances in Diagnostic Techniques and Vaccines for Malaria.,"Recent advances in the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infections have made it possible to consider supplementing light microscopy with a standardized dipstick antigen capture assay based on the detection of a parasite-specific protein, which is secreted by the asexual blood stages and immature gametocytes but not by the other stages. Field trials indicate that this dipstick assay provides consistently reproducible results, with a threshold of detection of P. falciparum parasitaemia similar to that obtained by high quality routine malaria microscopy and a specificity and sensitivity of around 90% compared with standard thick blood film microscopy. The stability, reproducibility, and ease of use of the assay clearly indicate that it has potential for application in the management of malaria, particularly at the peripheral health care level, provided its accuracy can be assured and that it can be made affordable. Consideration should be given to its wider use where operational requirements and resources so justify, and where decisions are based on adequate evaluation of the existing health delivery systems."

The definition of critical antigens involved in the induction of protective immunity against disease is essential. Our previous studies have characterized a synthetic peptide complex (SPf70), derived from a 70 kDa P. falciparum exoantigen, in terms of its immunogenicity and antigenic reactivity. In the present study total anti-P. falciparum asexual blood-stage antibodies and antibodies to the Pf70 antigen were measured by immunofluorescence (IFA) and ELISA, respectively, in children and adults (n = 160) of Kinshasa, Zaire, an area with continuous and intense malaria transmission. All of the subjects tested had IFA antibodies and 90% (143/160) had antibodies to Pf70 antigen. Antibody levels against Pf70 were significantly higher among children with low parasitemias (p < 0.05). These results suggest that antibodies to Pf70 antigen may have a protective role against P. falciparum infection. Further studies are needed to define the functional nature of the protective mechanism(s)."

Two types of errors occurred: generic errors common to both types of test and specific errors caused by the test design and manufacturer's instructions. End-user errors were more frequent with OptiMAL IT than Core Pf tests. To improve malaria diagnosis with rapid tests, users require training and better manufacturer's instructions that take into account local conditions."
CD008122,0,1786620,0,[Seroepidemiological study of malaria in the Algerian Sahara].,"On the basis of geoclimatic characteristics, the Saharan region of Algeria (area, 2 million km2) is made up of several subregions; analysis of the historical data on malaria in this region seems to show that the epidemiological situation is closely linked to climatic and hydrographic conditions. A longitudinal sero-epidemiological study was conducted in this vast region from September 1983 to April 1985. The general findings do not appear to support the existence of active foci of transmission, but analysis of the data for certain oases and localities leads to a quite different assessment of the epidemiological situation. At Ouargla, for example, the serological results obtained by indirect immunofluorescence show prevalence of under 5% in the four successive surveys, whereas in Heïha oasis over 50% of subjects over 30 years of age were found to be seropositive. The results of the longitudinal seroepidemiological surveys conducted in a number of localities and oases in the Saharan region reflect the diversity of epidemiological settings and provide evidence that there is low-level malaria transmission in some oases such as Heïha, Yakou, Ihérir and probably in In-Salah. These surveys confirm that malaria transmission has been halted in the former foci such as Ouargla and Timimoune. Finally, the longitudinal sero-epidemiological study shows there are movements of potential parasite carriers from countries south of the Sahara and therefore that oases associated with trans-Saharan trade are vulnerable."
CD008122,0,9093615,0,Altitude and the risk of bites from mosquitoes infected with malaria and filariasis among the Mianmin people of Papua New Guinea.,"The Mianmin are a mobile population occupying a remote lower montane area at 100-1200 m altitude in the north-western interior of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Major medical problems include malaria and bancroftian filariasis. An entomological survey conducted along an altitudinal transect from 170 to 1000m identified Anopheles koliensis as the predominant malaria vector below 650 m, with A. punctulatus dominating at the higher elevations. Proportions of mosquitoes with malaria circumsporozoite antigens diminished with increasing altitude, as did the proportion of mosquitoes infected with stage 3 larvae of Wuchereria bancrofti. These patterns are consistent with increases in the length of the extrinsic incubation period associated with the lower temperatures found at higher altitudes. Inoculation rates varied less regularly with altitude, owing to local variation in biting rates, but were sufficient even at the higher elevations to maintain a high parasite prevalence in the human population. Results support recent suggestions that the 'population-sink' model of the PNG highland fringes needs additionally to consider local variation due to non-altitude-related ecological factors."
CD008122,0,16937184,0,Automated image processing method for the diagnosis and classification of malaria on thin blood smears.,"Malaria is a serious global health problem, and rapid, accurate diagnosis is required to control the disease. An image processing algorithm to automate the diagnosis of malaria on thin blood smears is developed. The image classification system is designed to positively identify malaria parasites present in thin blood smears, and differentiate the species of malaria. Images are acquired using a charge-coupled device camera connected to a light microscope. Morphological and novel threshold selection techniques are used to identify erythrocytes (red blood cells) and possible parasites present on microscopic slides. Image features based on colour, texture and the geometry of the cells and parasites are generated, as well as features that make use of a priori knowledge of the classification problem and mimic features used by human technicians. A two-stage tree classifier using backpropogation feedforward neural networks distinguishes between true and false positives, and then diagnoses the species (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale or P. malariae) of the infection. Malaria samples obtained from the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the University of the Witwatersrand Medical School are used for training and testing of the system. Infected erythrocytes are positively identified with a sensitivity of 85% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 81%, which makes the method highly sensitive at diagnosing a complete sample provided many views are analysed. Species were correctly determined for 11 out of 15 samples."

Using a TMB peroxidase substrate in the ELISA, human bloodmeals were readily identified up to 40 h after ingestion in all laboratory-fed mosquitoes tested. Assay sensitivity declined to 75% identifiable 44 h post-feeding. The Human Blood Index and the Feeding Index of each species differed between the three villages studied. An.triannulatus was generally more anthropophilic than An.nuneztovari and An.oswaldoi. These contrasting results emphasize the difficulties of interpreting host choice data."
CD008122,0,10929245,0,Evaluation of the ICT malaria Pf test for rapid post-mortem diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in corpses examined for forensic reasons.,"To test the diagnostic value of a rapid and simple immunochromatographic test (ICT) based on the detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) for post-mortem examination, blood samples from 30 consecutive corpses were analysed by ICT and Giemsa-stained blood films. Compared to microscopy, ICT had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity even after a considerable time had passed between the presumed time of death and testing or after prolonged storage of whole blood samples. The ICT yielded positive results for four travellers who had returned from Kenya and died from Pl. falciparum malaria. The ICT might therefore serve as an additional tool for rapid malaria diagnosis, especially in non-endemic countries where experience with microscopic malaria detection is limited."
CD008122,0,12132997,0,Cysteine proteases of malaria parasites: targets for chemotherapy.,"New drugs to treat malaria are urgently needed. Cysteine proteases of malaria parasites offer potential new chemotherapeutic targets. Cysteine protease inhibitors block parasite hemoglobin hydrolysis and development, indicating that cysteine proteases play a key role in hemoglobin degradation, a necessary function of erythrocytic trophozoites. These inhibitors also block the rupture of erythrocytes by mature parasites, suggesting an additional role for cysteine proteases in the hydrolysis of erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins. Recent studies have shown that the repertoire of cysteine proteases of malaria parasites is larger than was previously realized. Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent human malaria parasite, expresses three papain-family cysteine proteases, known as falcipains. All three proteases are expressed by trophozoites and hydrolyze hemoglobin at acidic pH, suggesting roles in this process. Falcipain-2 also hydrolyzes ankyrin at neutral pH, suggesting additional activity against erythrocyte cytoskeletal targets. Multiple orthologs of the falcipains have been identified in other plasmodial species. Analysis of orthologs from animal model rodent parasites identified similar features, but some noteworthy biochemical differences between the cysteine proteases. These differences must be taken into account in interpreting in vivo experiments. A number of small molecule cysteine protease inhibitors blocked parasite hemoglobin hydrolysis and development, and inhibitory effects against parasites generally correlated with inhibition of falcipain-2. Some compounds also cured mice infected with otherwise lethal malaria infections. Current research priorities are to better characterize the biological roles and biochemical features of the falcipains. In addition, efforts to identify optimal falcipain inhibitors as antimalarials are underway."
CD008122,0,1575740,0,Molecular cloning and serological characterization of a new Plasmodium vivax recombinant antigen which contains apolipoprotein B-100 like sequences.,We have isolated a new recombinant antigen 'PV12' of Plasmodium vivax by immunological screening of the genomic library. The antigen shows a sequence homology with human apolipoprotein B-100. A large number of P. vivax infected individuals (79%) were seropositive against this antigen. The probable function of this antigen could be to evade the host defence system (i) by inactivating the perforin of natural killer cells and (ii) by engaging the host immune system to produce antibodies against this decoy antigen.

Insufficient numbers of tablets and inadequate package inserts result in sub-optimal dosing and possible treatment failure. This study reports the case of three, non-immune, expatriate workers with P. falciparum acquired in Africa, who failed to respond to artemisinin-based therapy. Sub-therapeutic dosing in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations was the probable cause."
CD008122,0,15550304,0,Aggressive active case detection: a malaria control strategy based on the Brazilian model.,"Since 1996, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has adopted a malaria control strategy known as aggressive active case detection (AACD) in which most or all members of every community are tested and treated for malaria on a monthly basis. The strategy attempts to identify and treat cases of asymptomatic malaria, which, if untreated, continue to transmit the infection. Malaria remains uncontrolled because almost all health care systems in the world rely on passive case detection: the treatment of only symptomatic cases of malaria. Research has shown conclusively that asymptomatic cases exist in any population where malaria transmission is stable and incidence is high: therefore passive case detection simply will not succeed in breaking the cycle of transmission. Numerous case studies show that malaria has been successfully controlled on a regional or national level by mass blood surveys. AACD is an effective malaria control strategy if used in conjunction with other methods, especially when (1) an effective treatment exists, (2) influx of potential carriers of the infection can be monitored, and (3) people are inclined to cooperate with monthly blood testing. AACD requires access to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), microscopy supplies, extensive human resources, and prompt, affordable, and effective treatment. AACD is compared to PCD in terms of clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness in a case study of malaria in the Brazilian Yanomami Indians. Where it is feasible, AACD could drastically reduce the incidence of malaria and should be an integral part of the World Health Organization's Roll Back Malaria strategy."
CD008122,0,1557226,0,In human malaria protective antibodies are directed mainly against the Lys-Glu ion pair within the Lys-Glu-Lys motif of the synthetic vaccine SPf 66.,"The KEK (Lysine-Glutamic acid-Lysine) motif is frequently found in the primary structure of certain malaria proteins involved in invasion, and plays an important role in the interaction of these proteins with the erythrocyte. This motif is contained in a peptide which forms part of the polymeric synthetic malaria vaccine SPf 66, currently undergoing extensive human trials. Analysis of the antibody titres against the subunit peptides that comprise this vaccine has shown that protection is associated with high titres to the KEK-containing peptide. In this paper we examine the fine recognition of this motif by polyclonal sera from protected vaccinated individuals, demonstrating the critical role played by the interacting ion pair formed between the amino terminal lysine (K) and glutamic acid (E), which act as contact residues for an important proportion of the antibody population directed against this vaccine. This ion pair in the KEK motif constitutes perhaps one of the most important malaria epitopes involved in protection, and could explain the mechanism through which protective immunity is acquired."

Vietnam is a Mekong regional 'success story' after dramatic declines in malaria incidence following introduction of a national control program providing free bed-nets, diagnosis and treatment. Malaria has largely retreated to pockets near international borders in central Vietnam, where it remains a burden particularly among impoverished ethnic minorities. In these areas commune and village health workers are lynchpins of the program. This study in the central province of Quang Tri aimed to contribute to more effective malaria control in Vietnam by documenting the non-biological pathways to malaria persistence in two districts."

Individuals belonging to three chromosomally characterized West African forms of this mosquito, which are important epidemiologically as they differ in vectorial capacity, were sampled both from laboratory stocks and from wild populations collected in three localities. The techniques used allowed for the unambiguous classification of the mosquitoes, providing a tool for rapid and efficient diagnosis, which previously relied on cytological examination of polytene chromosomes."
CD008122,0,15184454,0,"Comparison of blood smear, antigen detection, and nested-PCR methods for screening refugees from regions where malaria is endemic after a malaria outbreak in Quebec, Canada.","The importation of malaria into a region where it is not endemic raises many concerns, including the timely delivery of appropriate care, safety of the blood supply, and the risk of autochthonous transmission. There is presently no consensus on the best way to screen mobile populations for malaria. Between August 2000 and March 2001, 535 refugees arrived in Quebec, Canada, from Tanzanian camps. Within 4 weeks of resettlement of the first group of 224, the McGill University Centre for Tropical Diseases noted an outbreak of malaria across the province (15 cases over a 3-week period). This group (group 1) was traced and screened for malaria between 3 and 4 months after arrival in Canada. Subsequent groups of 106 and 205 refugees were screened immediately upon arrival in Canada (group 2) and immediately prior to their departure from refugee camps (group 3), respectively. A single EDTA-blood sample was obtained from 521 refugees for testing by thick and thin blood smears (groups 1 and 2), antigen detection (ICT Malaria Pf and OptiMAL; group 1 only), and nested PCR (all groups). Overall, 98 of 521 refugees were found to be infected (18.8%). The vast majority of infections (81 of 98) were caused by Plasmodium falciparum alone. Using PCR as the ""gold standard,"" both microscopy (sensitivity, 50%; specificity, 100%) and antigen detection (ICT sensitivity, 37.5%; ICT specificity, 100%; OptiMAL sensitivity, 29.1%; OptiMAL specificity, 95.6%) performed poorly. None of the PCR-positive subjects were symptomatic at the time of testing, and only two had recently had symptoms compatible with malaria (with or without diagnosis and treatment). Active surveillance of migrants from regions of intense malaria transmission can reduce the risk of morbidity in the migrant population and mitigate against transmission to the host population. Our data demonstrate that PCR is, by far, the most powerful tool for such surveillance."
CD008122,0,10473522,0,Comparison of PanBio dengue duo enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and MRL dengue fever virus immunoglobulin M capture ELISA for diagnosis of dengue virus infections in Southeast Asia.,"The performances of the MRL dengue fever virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the PanBio Dengue Duo IgM capture and IgG capture ELISA were compared. Eighty sera from patients with dengue virus infections, 24 sera from patients with Japanese encephalitis (JE), and 78 sera from patients with nonflavivirus infections, such as malaria, typhoid, leptospirosis, and scrub typhus, were used. The MRL test showed superior sensitivity for dengue virus infections (94 versus 89%), while the PanBio test showed superior specificity for JE (79 versus 25%) and other infections (100 versus 91%). The PanBio ELISA showed better overall performance, as assessed by the sum of sensitivity and specificity (F value). When dengue virus and nonflavivirus infections were compared, F values of 189 and 185 were obtained for the PanBio and MRL tests, respectively, while when dengue virus infections and JE were compared, F values of 168 and 119 were obtained. The results obtained with individual sera in the PanBio and MRL IgM ELISAs showed good correlation, but this analysis revealed that the cutoff value of the MRL test was set well below that of the PanBio test. Comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the tests at different cutoff values (receiver-operator analysis) revealed that the MRL and PanBio IgM ELISAs performed similarly in distinguishing dengue virus from nonflavivirus infections, although the PanBio IgM ELISA showed significantly better distinction between dengue virus infections and JE. The implications of these findings for the laboratory diagnosis of dengue are discussed."
CD008122,0,7985752,0,Relationship between humoral response to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface antigen-2 and malaria morbidity in a highly endemic area of Papua New Guinea.,"The prevalence and concentration of antibodies to merozoite surface antigen-2 (MSA-2) were measured in blood samples collected during a cross-sectional survey. Antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using two recombinant proteins that closely approximated the full-length mature MSA-2 polypeptides expressed by the Plasmodium falciparum isolate FC27 and the cloned line 3D7 and that were representative of the dimorphic forms of MSA-2. Antibodies were also measured to a form of the 3D7 MSA-2 lacking the central repetitive sequences (d3D7). High antibody prevalence was observed to all three antigens: the overall prevalence of IgG to FC27, 3D7, and d3D7 was 91%, 90%, and 90%, respectively. The majority of individuals > or = 5 years of age had antibodies to both forms of MSA-2. The geometric mean antibody units increased with age with a plateau being reached by 15-20 years of age. There was a significant positive association of antibody prevalence with both the presence of the parasite and an enlarged spleen in children. This study provides the first evidence that antibodies against nonrepeat regions of MSA-2 are associated with fewer fever episodes and less anemia, both known to be indicators of malaria morbidity."
CD008122,0,15305704,0,[The serodiagnosis of parasitic infections].,"Recently, the term of clinical immunoparasitology has been coined to indicate the application of immunological methods to the laboratory diagnosis of parasitic infections. In particular, serological diagnosis (indirect diagnosis) is useful especially in the cases of toxocarosis, trichinellosis, echinococcosis, cysticercosis, toxoplasmosis, amoebic abscess, some filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis. When possible, for infections caused by protozoa or helminths, the ""gold standard"" is represented by direct diagnosis performed by microscopic and/or macroscopic observation of the parasite. In any case, immunological results must be interpreted in consideration of the clinical picture of the patient and confirmed possibly by finding the parasite or its genome, even using molecular methods. Furthermore, since the presence of specific antibodies can reveal an acquired infection, but not necessarily a disease, it is particularly helpful, in addition to a qualitative evaluation, a quantitative one, by determining the serum antibody titre. After recovery, the antibody levels decrease, however, they may persist for long periods, for this reason they do not help in evaluating the treatment outcome. Interpretation of serological results may be difficult when the patients originate from areas where the suspected infection is endemic, in that case, a serum positivity could reflect an old exposition to the parasite, therefore it is not related to the present clinical status. Furthermore, serology may frequently result falsely negative in not immunocompetent subjects (organ transplanted, HIV positive individuals, premature babies, diabetics). Clinicians can interpret correctly the serological results only if the Parasitology laboratory inform them about the significant diagnostic values, the sensitivity and the specificity of the test in use. At present time, many diagnostic kits for immunoparasitology are commercially available, and industries are developing newer and newer ones (which are not always validated). In relation to this aspect, it should be helpful, for each of parasitic infection, to establish reference centers, not only to control the quality of commercial kits, but also as a reference point to those laboratories which use ""in house"" kits. To this regard, the recent establishment of a European Centre for Control of Infectious Diseases will help. The antigen characteristics (crude, E/S, recombinant, synthetic) for assays searching for antibodies (IHA, IFA, EIA, WB) of different classes, the controls to choose for these assays, the specimen requirements will be discussed. The recent findings on the serological diagnosis of intestinal protozoa infections, malaria, leishmaniasis, echinococcosis, cysticercosis, trichinellosis, toxocariasis, schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis will be presented."
CD008122,0,17362594,1,"A comparison of three diagnostic techniques for malaria: a rapid diagnostic test (NOW Malaria), PCR and microscopy.","Malaria is a common, life-threatening infection in endemic tropical areas and one that presents a diagnostic challenge to laboratories in most non-endemic countries. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is a prerequisite for effective treatment, especially for the potentially fatal cases of Plasmodium falciparum infection. In the present, multi-centre study, the performances of a rapid diagnostic test (NOW) Malaria) and several, commercial, PCR-based assays (AMS61, AMS42, AMS43, AMS4 and AMS45) were compared against the results of microscopical examination of bloodsmears (the current 'gold standard'). The subjects were either non-European immigrants (N=135) or international travellers (N=171). There was good concordance between the results of all the detection methods, with kappa values of >0.8. Although the NOW Malaria rapid test was both sensitive (100%) and specific (100%) in detecting P. falciparum infections, it was less specific (93.1%) and sensitive (90.7%) in identifying the other Plasmodium species. The results from the AMS61 assay, designed to detect any malarial infection, generally parallelled those of the microscopy (kappa = 0.89), giving a specificity of 98.2% and a sensitivity of 91.0%. Although the use of species-specific molecular primers to identify pure infections with P. falciparum and P. vivax gave results that were in good agreement with those of the microscopy, the subjects who had apparently pure infections with P. ovale or P. malariae were always found PCR-negative. Compared with the standard microscopy, both the NOW Malaria test and the PCR-based assays were therefore poor at identifying mixed infections. The NOW Malaria test and the PCR-based assays clearly need to be improved, particularly for the correct identification of infections with Plasmodium spp. other than P. falciparum, including mixed infections. For now, expert microscopy must remain the mainstay of the laboratory diagnosis of malaria."

In the current ancillary study to this clinical trial we have investigated the cellular immune responses specific for IRIV and the surface bound synthetic malaria peptides tested. After vaccination, in 50% (8/16) of the volunteers at least one positive lymphoproliferative response specific for the 49mer peptide derived from the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) was observed with stimulation indices ranging from 2 to 4.5. All volunteers showed pre-existing IRIV specific cellular immunity assessed by ex vivo IFN-gamma ELISpot analysis and lymphoproliferation. The pre-existing influenza specific T cell responses did not interfere negatively with the induction of malaria peptide-specific humoral and cellular immune responses.

Following pre-screening by the ELISA technique, reactive sera were further analyzed for specificity to HTLV-I or HTLV-III antigens by competition and/or Western blotting experiments. African sera, possibly because they have higher immunoglobulin levels than US and European sera, are highly reactive in ELISA systems and confirmatory assays are essential to rule out false-positive results. Confirmed antibody prevalence for HTLV-I was 13.2% (II females and 13 males) and increased with age, suggesting continuous exposure to the virus throughout life. Confirmed antibody prevalence for HTLV-III was 6.0% (8 females and 3 males) and showed a peak age range between 21 and 40 years, suggesting heterosexual transmission. Individuals positive for HTLV-I antibodies were not the same as individuals positive for HTLV-III antibodies, suggesting that infection with one virus did not increase susceptibility to infection by the other virus. Further investigations of the epidemiology and of the immunovirology of HTLV-III in Zaire, in relation to acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated pathologies, should enlighten the question of the significant percentage of HTLV-III-infected individuals who do not manifest symptoms of AIDS."

Pre-treatment weights were significantly lower than the 14 to 28-day post-treatment weights (P = 0.0001). In 187 children, fractional fall in body weight (FFBW) exceeded 4.9%. FFBW correlated negatively with age and body weight (P = 0.014 and 0.0001, respectively), but not with enrollment parasitaemia.

Optimal antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis are bactericidal, nontoxic, inexpensive, and active against the typical pathogens that cause surgical site infection postoperatively. To maximize its effectiveness, intravenous perioperative prophylaxis should be given within 30 to 60 minutes before the time of surgical incision. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be of short duration to decrease toxicity, antimicrobial resistance, and excess cost."

Despite the controversy, it has been proposed that when associated they may lead to important effects in the natural history of both infections. This study estimates the prevalence of coinfection within general population of an endemic region of HBV and malaria in the Brazilian Amazon. The prevalence of HBsAg was 3.3% (95% CI 2.1%-5.1%,) and total anti-HBc 49.9% (95% CI 45.9%-53.8%). The prevalence of antibodies against Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum antigens was 51.4% (311/605) (95% CI 47.3%-55.4%). Related to the simultaneous presence of malaria antibodies and HBV serological markers, in 1.8% (11/605), (95% CI 1.0%-3.3%), the presence of HBsAg was also demonstrated, mean age 26 years (p <0.001). This study points to similarities in the distribution of these diseases, such as the occurrence mainly among young adults. The events may occur in different times. Also shown differences such as the low risk of malaria in the group up to fifteen years, where HBV circulates with moderate intensity. The prevalence of HBV and malaria coinfection is in fact less than the rates of HBsAg carriage, showing a heterogeneous pattern related to the clinical spectrum of HBV infection."
CD008122,0,8266400,0,Case studies from the biomedical and health systems research activities of the Swiss Tropical Institute in Africa.,"Neither high theoretical efficacy of disease control tools, nor diagnostic accuracy, nor good compliance, nor adequate coverage can lead on its own to the final goal of community effectiveness. There is a complex relationship between these factors. The different steps in the process leading to effective health care in the community are discussed on the basis of biomedical and health systems research activities of the Swiss Tropical Institute. Schistosomiasis and malaria control provide the background to problems related to the efficacy of tools. In particular, information on the trial of a malaria vaccine candidate (SPf66) is given. Approaches to the rapid, accurate and economical diagnosis of communities at risk are discussed with reference to Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni. Health service support projects in Tanzania and Chad are presented to exemplify problems linked to the compliance of users/providers and coverage. Finally, it is shown that community effectiveness depends on the highest possible success rate for each step. This requires the co-operative efforts of all those involved: the scientist, the manager, the community health worker and, last but not least, the community itself."
CD008122,0,10070656,0,Treatment with recombinant human tumour necrosis factor-alpha reduces parasitaemia and prevents Plasmodium berghei K173-induced experimental cerebral malaria in mice.,"The present study shows that treatment with recombinant human tumour necrosis factor-alpha (rhTNF-alpha) can suppress parasitaemia and prevents development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in Plasmodium berghei K173-infected mice. Mice received rhTNF-alpha treatment either by subcutaneous injection of free or liposome-encapsulated rhTNF-alpha or sustained intraperitoneal administration of rhTNF-alpha given via mini-osmotic pumps. Low-dose treatment with a subcutaneous bolus injection of rhTNF-alpha protected against ECM when treatment was started on day 5 or 6 after infection. The same protective efficacy was obtained either by subcutaneous injection of liposome-encapsulated rhTNF-alpha or by sustained release from osmotic pumps, but in the latter case a 10-fold lower daily dose of rhTNF-alpha was sufficient. Treatment with rhTNF-alpha substantially suppressed parasitaemia in ECM-protected mice, but not in mice developing ECM. Thus, the rhTNF-alpha mediated suppression of parasitaemia is directly or indirectly involved in protection against ECM. Sustained delivery of rhTNF-alpha through osmotic pumps, but not by subcutaneous injection of liposome-encapsulated rhTNF-alpha, resulted in increased concentrations of soluble mouse TNF receptor R75 (sTNFR75) in plasma at day 9 after infection when non-treated mice die of ECM. Thus, protection against ECM is not directly correlated with the sTNFR75 concentrations at day 9 after infection."

Severe deficiency was detected by the rapid test in 45 of 1126 volunteers in Indonesia and 54 of 1079 in Myanmar, but it was difficult to distinguish blood samples with mild deficiency from those with normal activity. 89 of 99 severely deficient cases were later confirmed by formazan ring method in the laboratory, but 5 with mild and 5 with no deficiency were misdiagnosed as severe. Of the samples diagnosed as mild and no deficiency on-site, none was found to be severely deficient by the formazan method. Malaria patients were simultaenously++ detected on-site in 273 samples on Halmahera island and 277 samples from Shan and Mon States. In Mon State, primaquine was prescribed safely to G6 PD-normal malaria patients infected with Plasmodium vivax and/or gametocytes of P. falciparum. The new rapid test for G6 PD deficiency may be useful for detecting severe cases under field conditions, and both rapid tests combined are can be useful in malaria-endemic areas, facilitating early diagnosis, prompt and radical treatment of malaria and suppression of malaria transmission."
CD008122,0,18375970,0,"Possible risk factors for congenital malaria at a tertiary care hospital in Sagamu, Ogun State, South-West Nigeria.","Congenital malaria, defined as the presence of malaria parasites in the erythrocytes of newborns aged <7 days, was considered rare in endemic areas until recent studies started reporting high prevalence rates. Various theories have been postulated to explain this phenomenon, but they are not proven conclusively from research. Against this background, a prospective study was designed with the following objectives. To determine the prevalence of congenital malaria parasitaemia and identify possible risk factors amongst newborns delivered in O.O.U.T.H Sagamu, Ogun State. Over a 6-month period, 192 live newborns and their mothers were consecutively recruited into the study. Within 3 days of life, neonatal peripheral blood samples were collected for malaria screening by blood film microscopy and detection of plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) with the OptiMAL Rapid Malaria Test kit. Maternal peripheral blood samples were taken simultaneously, to check for malaria infestation by blood film microscopy, and questionnaires were administered on the mothers to identify possible factors associated with the development of neonatal parasitaemia. Neonatal clinical and laboratory data were recorded in a pro forma designed for the study. Data analysis was done with Epi-info version 6 software and level of significance set at <5%. Twenty-one of 192 newborns delivered in O.O.U.T.H within the study period were diagnosed as having congenital malaria by blood film microscopy, giving a prevalence rate of 10.9%. The main identified innate neonatal risk factor for congenital malaria parasitaemia was prematurity. First-order pregnancy, history of fever within 3 months of delivery and peripheral parasitaemia at delivery (p < 0.001) were the variables that were significantly higher in the mothers of the parasitemic newborns. We conclude that congenital malaria parasitaemia in tropical endemic areas is not rare. Pre-term neonates, infants of primigravidae, women with history of fever within 3 months of delivery and women with post-partum peripheral parasitaemia may benefit from routine screening for malaria."

CD008122,0,10072132,1,Comparison of five methods of malaria detection in the outpatient setting.,"In eastern Africa where 90% of the malaria is due to Plasmodium falciparum, the accuracy of malaria diagnosis at the outpatient level is becoming increasingly important due to problems of drug resistance and use of alternative, costly antimalarial drugs. The quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique, acridine orange staining with an interference filter system, and the ParaSight-F test have been introduced as alternative methods to conventional microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria. Two hundred thirteen outpatients were tested using these alternative methods and conventional microscopy by five experienced technologists; two were randomly allocated to read the results of each test. Paired results showed the highest level of agreement with the ParaSight-F test (99%), followed by Field stain (92%). The results of the QBC technique showed the least agreement (73%). Using conventional microscopy as the reference standard, the ParaSight-F test had a sensitivity range of 90-92% and a specificity of 99%, staining with acridine orange had a sensitivity range of 77-96% and a specificity range of 81-98% and the QBC technique had a sensitivity range of 88-98% and a specificity range of 58-90%. All microscopic tests showed lower sensitivities (as low as 20% using staining with acridine orange) in detecting low parasitemias (< or = 320/microl) than the ParaSight-F test (70%). Due to the high cost of the ParaSight-F test, Field-stained blood films remain the most appropriate method for diagnosis of P. falciparum in eastern Africa. The ParaSight-F test may be used in situations where no trained microscopists are available, or where malaria is strongly suspected and the results of microscopy are negative."

Rapid dipstick technology provides a potential alternative. A study was conducted in The Gambia to compare the performance of OptiMAL, an immunochromatographic antigen detection assay for the diagnosis of malaria using parasite lactate dehydrogenase, against standard microscopy in patients with suspected malaria. For initial diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum, irrespective of stage, this assay had a sensitivity of 91.3%, a specificity of 92%, a positive predictive value of 87.2%, and a negative predictive value of 94.7%. The sensitivity of the test decreased markedly at parasitemias < 0.01%. This assay can be used for the diagnosis of malaria in areas where microscopy is not available and for urgent malaria diagnosis at night and at weekends, when routine laboratories are closed and when relatively inexperienced microscopists may be on duty."

Blood samples were collected from 364 volunteer villagers, and each sample was examined with both the QBC and GTF techniques. For each GTF sample (10 microliters of blood), as many as 300 oil-immersion fields were examined; each QBC tube was inspected for up to 5 minutes. The GTF technique resulted in 86 positive blood samples and 278 negative; the QBC technique indicated 89 positive and 275 negative samples. Relative to the results obtained with GTF, the QBC technique had a sensitivity and specificity of 87.2% and 95.0%, respectively; concordance between the tests was 93.1%. The median time-to-positive diagnosis with the QBC technique (1.12 min) was 11% of that with GTF. The distribution of different developmental stages of Plasmodium vivax parasites was also examined in the centrifuged QBC tubes: all stages except schizonts could be found in the lower part of the platelet zone (the interphase between the monocyte and platelet layers), especially ring forms."
CD008122,0,9060222,0,An evaluation of clinical indicators for severe paediatric illness.,"To help reduce paediatric morbidity and mortality in the developing world, WHO has developed a diagnostic and treatment algorithm that targets the principal causes of death in children, which include acute respiratory infection, malaria, measles, diarrhoeal disease, and malnutrition. With this algorithm, known as the Sick Child Charts, severely ill children are rapidly identified, through the presence of any one of 13 signs indicative of severe illness, and referred for more intensive health care. These signs are the inability to drink, abnormal mental status (abnormally sleepy), convulsions, wasting, oedema, chest wall retraction, stridor, abnormal skin turgor, repeated vomiting, stiff neck, tender swelling behind the ear, pallor of the conjunctiva, and corneal ulceration. The usefulness of these signs, both in current clinical practice and within the optimized context of the Sick Child Chart algorithm in a rural district of western Kenya, was evaluated. We found that 27% of children seen in outpatient clinics had one or more of these signs and that pallor and chest wall retraction were the signs most likely to be associated with hospital admission (odds ratio (OR) = 8.6 and 5.3, respectively). Presentation with any of these signs led to a 3.2 times increased likelihood of admission, although 54% of hospitalized children had no such signs and 21% of children sent home from the outpatient clinic had at least one sign. Among inpatients, 58% of all children and 89% of children who died had been admitted with a sign. Abnormal mental status was the sign most highly associated with death (OR = 59.6), followed by poor skin turgor (OR = 5.6), pallor (OR = 4.3), repeated vomiting (OR = 3.6), chest wall retraction (OR = 2.7), and oedema (OR = 2.4). Overall, the mortality risk associated with having at least one sign was 6.5 times higher than that for children without any sign. While these signs are useful in identifying a subset of children at high risk of death, their validation in other settings is needed. The training and supervision of health workers to identify severely ill children should continue to be given high priority because of the benefits, such as reduction of childhood mortality."
CD008122,0,2237593,0,Competitive antibody binding inhibition ELISA for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum antigen.,"A competitive antibody binding inhibition ELISA to detect Plasmodium falciparum-infected cells in clinical specimens was developed. Optimum conditions developed included: 12.5 micrograms/ml of P. falciparum antigen for plate coating, 25 micrograms/ml of polyclonal rabbit anti-P. falciparum IgG, 30 minute incubation of a mixture of infected red blood cell extract with anti-P. falciparum IgG, dilution of 1:500 of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and reading of the absorbance values 60 min after adding the p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate. Reproducibility of the assay against cultured P. falciparum-infected red blood cells varied according to parasitemia, the higher the parasitemia, the better the reproducibility. The sensitivity of the assay was approximately 110 parasites/10(6) red blood cells. The assay was applied to field conditions involving 103 cases with falciparum malaria, 38 cases with vivax malaria and 30 healthy controls. With the 10% antibody binding inhibition as a cutoff, 87.4% of falciparum cases and 26.3% of vivax cases were positive. After treatment, the majority of cases became parasitologically negative with the corresponding negative assay. Regression analysis showed only weak but statistically significant correlation between the percent inhibition with parasitemia (r = 0.38, p less than 0.001), and this was more clearly shown in patients with high parasitemia."

CD008122,0,17280676,0,Delayed parasite elimination in human infections treated with clindamycin parallels 'delayed death' of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro.,"Clindamycin is safe and effective for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but its use as monotherapy is limited by unacceptably slow initial clinical response rates. To investigate whether the protracted action is due to an accumulative, time of exposure-dependent or a delayed effect on parasite growth, we studied the in vivo and in vitro pharmacodynamic profiles of clindamycin against P. falciparum. In vivo, elimination of young, circulating asexual parasite stages during treatment with clindamycin displayed an unusual biphasic kinetic: a plateau phase was followed by a precipitated decline of asexual parasite densities to nearly undetectable levels after 72 and 60 h in adult patients and asymptomatic children, respectively, suggesting an uninhibited capacity to establish a second, but not third, infectious cycle. In vitro, continuous exposure of a laboratory-adapted P. falciparum strain to clindamycin with concentrations of up to 100 microM for two replication cycles (96 h) did not produce inhibitory effects of >50% compared with drug-free controls as measured by the production of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein II (PfHRP2). PfHRP2 production was completely arrested after the second cycle (96-144h) (>10,000-fold decrease of mean half-inhibitory concentrations measured at 96-144h compared to 48-96h). Furthermore, incubation with clindamycin during only the first (0-48h) versus three (0-144h) parasite replication cycles led to comparable inhibition of PfHRP2 production in the third infectious cycle (96-144h) (mean IC(99) of 27 and 22nM, respectively; P=0.2). When parasite cultures were exposed to different concentrations of clindamycin ranging from 50 to 1,000nM for 72h and followed up in an experiment designed to simulate a typical 3-day treatment regimen, parasitaemia was initially suppressed below the microscopic detection threshold. Nonetheless, parasites reappeared in a dose-dependent manner after removal of drug at 72h but not in continuously drug-exposed controls. The delayed, but potent, antimalarial effect of clindamycin appears to be of greatest potential benefit in new combinations of clindamycin with rapidly acting antimalarial combination partners."

This study was taken up to compare the efficacy of various rapid methods viz, acridine orange, Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein II antigen detection and Field's stain with traditional microscopy i.e, Leishman stain for diagnosing falciparum malaria. Thick and thin blood films of 443 consecutive patients with history of fever with chills and rigors were examined by Leishman and Field's method. Acridine orange stained wet mounts of blood were examined under fluorescence microscopy. All films were examined by two independent microbiologists. Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein II antigen was detected using commercially available kit, Paracheck Pf. Out of the 443 subjects examined for P.falciparum 18.28% were detected by Leishman stain, 6.32% by Field's stain, 18.28% by acridine orange and 18.1% by antigen based technique. Field's stain missed 53 (65.4%), while Paracheck Pf was negative in 6(7.4%) of the Leishman positive samples. All Field's stain and acridine orange positives were positive by Leishman, but five Paracheck Pf positives were negative. Leishman stain is cost effective but if facilities are available one should use acridine orange for screening. The antigen detection kits are rapid, simple and are useful but to rule out false negatives in clinically suspected cases, Leishman stain is reliable."

Here we discuss the relevance of an emerging technology, multiplexed immunoassays read by flow cytometry, for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In these assays, multiple fluorescent microspheres, conjugated to different antigens or antibodies, constitute the solid phase for detecting antibodies or antigens in biological samples. These assays seem to be more sensitive than traditional immunoassays, have a high throughput capacity, and provide a wide analytical dynamic range. Additionally, they have multiplexing ability-ie, they are capable of measuring multiple antibodies or antigens simultaneously. We discuss four different areas where this technology could make an impact in resource-poor settings: (i) infections causing rash and fever in children; (ii) sero-epidemiological studies on vaccine-preventable diseases; (iii) management of genital ulcers and vaginal discharge; and (iv) screening of infections in blood banking. We predict a widespread use for a new breed of small, affordable, practical flow cytometers as field instruments for replacing ELISA and RIA tests, which will also be capable of doing cellular immunological tests such as CD4+ T-cell enumeration and Plasmodium falciparum detection in whole blood."

CD008122,0,18086262,0,Naturally acquired immunity and reduced susceptibility to falciparum malaria in two subpopulations of endemic eastern India.,"This study was aimed to assess the prevalence of naturally acquired humoral immune responses and their association with reduced susceptibility to malaria in children and adults with differential clinical conditions from an Indian zone where malaria is endemic. The study was undertaken in an eastern province of India (Keonjhar, Orissa) in a group of 341 children (both younger and older) and 98 adults living in two different areas, Town area and Forest area. They were studied for their parasitological and immunological profiles. Sera from different age-matched groups were screened by ELISA to measure IgG reactivities for characterizing humoral immune responses to the B-cell epitopes of Plasmodium falciparum MSP1, AMA1, RAP1 and EBA175 peptides and P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte lysate. In Town area, overall P. falciparum cases were 5.5%, whereas those in Forest area were 26.7%. We observed an age-wise increasing trend of immunity in these two populations. It was also noticed that the frequency of responders to stage-specific antigens was higher in individuals from the Town area where the frequency of malaria was lower. The naturally acquired humoral immune responses to different stage-specific antigens of P. falciparum reflect the reduced risk of malaria in the study groups. The higher frequency of seroresponders showed correlation with lower risk of developing malaria."
CD008122,0,16515509,0,Immune response to pre-erythrocytic stages of malaria parasites.,"Immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium spp. sporozoites induces sterile protective immunity against parasite challenge. This immunity is targeted primarily against the intrahepatic parasite and appears to be sustained long term even in the absence of sporozoite exposure. It is mediated by multifactorial mechanisms, including T cells directed against parasite antigens expressed in the liver stage of the parasite life cycle and antibodies directed against sporozoite surface proteins. In rodent models, CD8+ T cells have been implicated as the principal effector cells, and IFN-gamma as a critical effector molecule. IL-4 secreting CD4+ T cells are required for induction of the CD8+ T cell responses, and Th1 CD4+ T cells provide help for optimal CD8+ T cell effector activity. Components of the innate immune system, including gamma-delta T cells, natural killer cells and natural killer T cells, also play a role. The precise nature of pre-erythrocytic stage immunity in humans, including the contribution of these immune responses to the age-dependent immunity naturally acquired by residents of malaria endemic areas, is still poorly defined. The importance of immune effector targets at the pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle is highlighted by the fact that infection-blocking immunity in humans rarely, if ever, occurs under natural conditions. Herein, we review our current understanding of the molecular and cellular aspects of pre-erythrocytic stage immunity."
CD008122,0,17312157,0,A novel antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mechanism involved in defense against malaria requires costimulation of monocytes FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII.,"Clinical experiments have shown that the Ab-dependent cell-mediated inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum is a major mechanism controlling malaria parasitemia and thereby symptoms. In this study, we demonstrate that a single merozoite per monocyte (MN) is sufficient to trigger optimal antiparasitic activity. Using particulate Ag as pseudomerozoites, we show that only Ags, and no other parasite-derived factor, are required to trigger MN activation and that a single Ag is as potent as the complex combination of Ags constituting the merozoite surface. Moreover, we found that soluble Ags binding at least two Abs are as effective as the parasite at stimulating MN and that nonmalarial Ags are as efficient provided they are targeted by cytophilic Abs. Indeed, only cytophilic IgGs are potent and, in agreement with immunoepidemiological findings, IgG3 is superior to IgG1. Very low Ab concentrations (>700 pM), i.e., in the range of molecules having a hormonal effect, are effective, in contrast to Abs having a direct, neutralizing effect. Finally, Ab-dependent cell-mediated inhibition proved to require the synergistic activation of both FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa which both distinguish it from other Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and implies that all MN are not equally effective. These findings have both fundamental and practical implications, particularly for vaccine discovery."
CD008122,0,3895998,0,Detection of Plasmodium falciparum in blood using DNA hybridization.,"A rapid and simple assay for detecting Plasmodium falciparum in human blood was developed. The assay is based on DNA-DNA spot hybridization, using radiolabeled P. falciparum DNA as a probe and finger prick blood as the assay sample. It is very sensitive, able to detect parasitemia levels of 0.0001% in 10 microliter of blood. The assay can be quantified and used to estimate parasitemia levels. Several hundred blood samples can be processed simultaneously, and the entire procedure is completed within 24 hr. This assay can be useful for epidemiological surveys, for screening of blood by blood banks and for health authorities examining immigrants and tourists coming from malaria infested areas."
CD008122,0,19139189,0,Immunoglobulin G subclass-specific responses against Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens are associated with control of parasitemia and protection from symptomatic illness.,"Substantial evidence indicates that antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens play a role in protection from malaria, although the precise targets and mechanisms mediating immunity remain unclear. Different malaria antigens induce distinct immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass responses, but the importance of different responses in protective immunity from malaria is not known and the factors determining subclass responses in vivo are poorly understood. We examined IgG and IgG subclass responses to the merozoite antigens MSP1-19 (the 19-kDa C-terminal region of merozoite surface protein 1), MSP2 (merozoite surface protein 2), and AMA-1 (apical membrane antigen 1), including different polymorphic variants of these antigens, in a longitudinal cohort of children in Papua New Guinea. IgG1 and IgG3 were the predominant subclasses of antibodies to each antigen, and all antibody responses increased in association with age and exposure without evidence of increasing polarization toward one subclass. The profiles of IgG subclasses differed somewhat for different alleles of MSP2 but not for different variants of AMA-1. Individuals did not appear to have a propensity to make a specific subclass response irrespective of the antigen. Instead, data suggest that subclass responses to each antigen are generated independently among individuals and that antigen properties, rather than host factors, are the major determinants of IgG subclass responses. High levels of AMA-1-specific IgG3 and MSP1-19-specific IgG1 were strongly predictive of a reduced risk of symptomatic malaria and high-density P. falciparum infections. However, no antibody response was significantly associated with protection from parasitization per se. Our findings have major implications for understanding human immunity and for malaria vaccine development and evaluation."

CD008122,0,10612287,0,Analysis of membrane proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis: comparison of the proteins extracted from normal or Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocyte ghosts.,"Parasite-encoded membrane proteins translocated to the surface of infected erythrocytes or in specialized vesicles underneath (Maurer's clefts) play a key role in the asexual life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum (a malaria-causing protozoan), by mediating key steps such as red blood cell invasion, sequestration of infected cells in microcapillaries, and red blood cell rupture. A large-scale analysis of these membrane proteins would therefore be of great help to gain knowledge of the different stages of the Plasmodium falciparum life cycle. In order to be able to detect and identify parasite-encoded proteins directed to the red blood cell membrane, we first defined the conditions required for optimal extraction and separation of normal red blood cell ghost proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. These conditions included the use of urea, thiourea and new zwitterionic detergents in the extraction and isoelectric focusing media. The optimized conditions were then applied to analyze normal and P. falciparum-infected red blood cell ghosts. Several protein spots were found only in infected ghosts and are expected to represent parasite-encoded proteins. These proteins are currently under investigation."
CD008122,0,12031069,0,HIV infection and tropical parasitic diseases - deleterious interactions in both directions?,"HIV and parasitic infections interact and affect each other mutually. Whereas HIV infection may alter the natural history of parasitic diseases, impede rapid diagnosis or reduce the efficacy of antiparasitic treatment, parasitoses may facilitate the infection with HIV as well as the progression from asymptomatic infection to AIDS. We review data on known interactions for malaria, leishmaniasis, Human African Trypanosomiasis, Chagas' disease, onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis and intestinal helminthiases. The common immunopathogenetic basis for the deleterious effects parasitic diseases may have on the natural history of HIV infection seems to be a particular type of chronic immune activation and a preferential activation of the T helper (Th)2 type of help. Control of parasitic diseases should complement the tools currently used in combating the HIV pandemic."
CD008122,0,18343736,0,[Quinine-induced renal bilateral cortical necrosis].,"Acute bilateral renal cortical necrosis is a rare cause of renal failure frequently induced by disseminated intravascular coagulation (Dic) following obstetrical complications, sepsis and drugs. We describe a case of Dic with bilateral cortical necrosis after ingestion of only one tablet of quinine. A 41-year-old woman was admitted for severe abdominal pain, melaena, fever and anuria two hours after quinine tablet intake for nocturnal leg cramps. Her medical history included angioneurotic edema caused by chloroquine for malaria prevention. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory data showed acute renal failure, hemolytic anemia without schistocytes and Dic. Platelet antibodies were negative. Ultrasonographic examination showed a complete defect of renal perfusion with permeable renal arteries. Results of abdominal CT scan and MAG3 scintigraphy led to the diagnosis of bilateral renal cortical necrosis. The patient underwent plasma exchanges with fresh frozen plasma which induced rapid resolution of Dic. She remained dependent on chronic hemodialysis. Quinine-induced microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and Dic is a rare described entity. These complications occur typically in quinine-sensitized subjects. The presence of acute renal failure is generally associated with poor prognosis in case of bilateral renal cortical necrosis. Caution is required for the prescription of quinine derivates, which should be avoided in patients experienced on adverse reaction to the drug."
CD008122,0,18165470,0,Malaria in pregnancy: linking immunity and pathogenesis to prevention.,"Pregnant women are susceptible to malaria during pregnancy. Plasmodium falciparum, which sequesters in the placenta, causes the greatest disease, contributing significantly to maternal and infant mortality. Parasitized cells in the placenta express unique variant surface antigens (VSA), predominantly the VAR2CSA protein, and lack of immunity to these pregnancy-specific variant surface antigens explains some of the pregnancy-associated malaria susceptibility. Changes in acquired cellular immunity during pregnancy also appear important. Placental inflammatory responses, particularly monocyte infiltrates, predispose to fetal growth restriction and maternal anemia. Preventing malaria in pregnancy relies on insecticide treated bed nets, intermittent preventive treatment with antimalarials such as sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, and potentially relies on the development of effective vaccines. The optimal deployment of each may depend heavily on the relationship between the timing of placental malaria infection and its deleterious consequences. Improved understanding of the relationship between pathogenesis, immunity, and pregnancy outcome will allow better targeting of our interventions to prevent the consequences of malaria in pregnancy."
CD008122,0,17257891,0,"High rate of detection of mixed infections of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum in South-East of Iran, using nested PCR.","Sistan and Baluchestan province, South-East of Iran, has been reported as an endemic area of malaria [Sadrizadeh B. Malaria in the world, in the eastern Mediterranean region and in Iran: Review article. WHO/EMRO Report 2001: 1-13.]. The main objective of this research was to perform rapid and correct diagnoses of malaria infection. Blood specimens were collected from 140 suspected volunteers. The Giemsa-stained slides examination and nested PCR for amplification of the Plasmodium small subunit ribosomal genes (ssrRNA) were utilized. The results demonstrated 118 out of 140 cases (84.3%) positive for malaria parasites, including 60.7%, 20.7% and 2.9% as having Plasmodium vivax (P.v), Plasmodium falciparum (P.f) and mixed infections (P.v+P.f), respectively by microscopy. The nested PCR detected malaria parasites in 134 samples (94.3%), consisting of 51.4% P.v, 12.6% P.f and 29.3% mixed infections. The PCR analysis detected 37 cases of mixed infections more than that of the routine microscopy. These results suggested that there are a considerable number of cases with mixed infections in the study area that mainly remain undiagnosed by microscopy. It is also concluded that the nested PCR is a suitable complement to microscopy for accurate specific diagnosis of malaria species in field."

CD008122,0,15039349,0,Measuring the effects of an ever-changing environment on malaria control.,"The effectiveness of malaria control measures depends not only on the potency of the control measures themselves but also upon the influence of variables associated with the environment. Environmental variables have the capacity either to enhance or to impair the desired outcome. An optimal outcome in the field, which is ultimately the real goal of vaccine research, will result from prior knowledge of both the potency of the control measures and the role of environmental variables. Here we describe both the potential effectiveness of control measures and the problems associated with testing in an area of endemicity. We placed canaries with different immunologic backgrounds (e.g., naïve to malaria infection, vaccinated naïve, and immune) directly into an area where avian malaria, Plasmodium relictum, is endemic. In our study setting, canaries that are naïve to malaria infection routinely suffer approximately 50% mortality during their first period of exposure to the disease. In comparison, birds vaccinated and boosted with a DNA vaccine plasmid encoding the circumsporozoite protein of P. relictum exhibited a moderate degree of protection against natural infection (P < 0.01). In the second year we followed the fate of all surviving birds with no further manipulation. The vaccinated birds from the first year were no longer statistically distinguishable for protection against malaria from cages of naïve birds. During this period, 36% of vaccinated birds died of malaria. We postulate that the vaccine-induced protective immune responses prevented the acquisition of natural immunity similar to that concurrently acquired by birds in a neighboring cage. These results indicate that dominant environmental parameters associated with malaria deaths can be addressed before their application to a less malleable human system."
CD008122,0,17997848,0,Cerebrospinal fluid and serum biomarkers of cerebral malaria mortality in Ghanaian children.,"Plasmodium falciparum can cause a diffuse encephalopathy known as cerebral malaria (CM), a major contributor to malaria associated mortality. Despite treatment, mortality due to CM can be as high as 30% while 10% of survivors of the disease may experience short- and long-term neurological complications. The pathogenesis of CM and other forms of severe malaria is multi-factorial and appear to involve cytokine and chemokine homeostasis, inflammation and vascular injury/repair. Identification of prognostic markers that can predict CM severity will enable development of better intervention."

CD008122,0,17215045,0,UK malaria treatment guidelines.,"Malaria is the tropical disease most commonly imported into the UK, with 1500-2000 cases reported each year, and 10-20 deaths. Approximately three-quarters of reported malaria cases in the UK are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which is capable of invading a high proportion of red blood cells and rapidly leading to severe or life-threatening multi-organ disease. Most non-falciparum malaria cases are caused by Plasmodium vivax; a few cases are caused by the other two species of Plasmodium: Plasmodium ovale or Plasmodium malariae. Mixed infections with more than 1 species of parasite can occur; they commonly involve P. falciparum with the attendant risks of severe malaria. Management of malaria depends on awareness of the diagnosis and on performing the correct diagnostic tests: the diagnosis cannot be excluded until 3 blood specimens have been examined by an experienced microscopist. There are no typical clinical features of malaria, even fever is not invariably present. The optimum diagnostic procedure is examination of thick and thin blood films by an expert to detect and speciate the malarial parasites; P. falciparum malaria can be diagnosed almost as accurately using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which detect plasmodial antigens or enzymes, although RDTs for other Plasmodium species are not as reliable. The treatment of choice for non-falciparum malaria is a 3-day course of oral chloroquine, to which only a limited proportion of P. vivax strains have gained resistance. Dormant parasites (hypnozoites) persist in the liver after treatment of P. vivax or P. ovale infection: the only currently effective drug for eradication of hypnozoites is primaquine. This must be avoided or given with caution under expert supervision in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), in whom it may cause severe haemolysis. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria can be treated orally with quinine, atovaquone plus proguanil (Malarone) or co-artemether (Riamet); quinine is highly effective but poorly tolerated in prolonged dosage and is always supplemented by additional treatment, usually with oral doxycycline. ALL patients treated for P. falciparum malaria should be admitted to hospital for at least 24 h, since patients can deteriorate suddenly, especially early in the course of treatment. Severe falciparum malaria, or infections complicated by a relatively high parasite count (more than 2% of red blood cells parasitized), should be treated with intravenous therapy until the patient is well enough to continue with oral treatment. In the UK, the treatment of choice for severe or complicated malaria is currently an infusion of intravenous quinine. This may exacerbate hypoglycaemia that can occur in malaria; patients treated with intravenous quinine therefore require careful monitoring. Intravenous artesunate reduces high parasite loads more rapidly than quinine and is more effective in treating severe malaria in selected situations. It can also be used in patients with contra-indications to quinine. Intravenous artesunate is unlicensed in the EU. Assistance in obtaining artesunate may be sought from specialist tropical medicine centres, on consultation, for named patients. Patients with severe or complicated malaria should be managed in a high dependency or intensive care environment. They may require haemodynamic support and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal impairment/failure, seizures, and severe intercurrent infections including gram-negative bacteraemia/septicaemia. Falciparum malaria in pregnancy is more likely to be severe and complicated: the placenta contains high levels of parasites. Stillbirth or early delivery may occur and diagnosis can be difficult if parasites are concentrated in the placenta and scanty in the blood. The treatment of choice for falciparum malaria in pregnancy is quinine; doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy but clindamycin can be substituted for it, and is equally effective. Primaquine (for eradication of P. vivax or P. ovale hypnozoites) is contraindicated in pregnancy; after treatment for these infections a pregnant woman should take weekly chloroquine prophylaxis until after delivery when hypnozoite eradication can be considered. Children are over-represented in the incidence of malaria in the UK, probably because completely susceptible UK-born children accompany their overseas-born parents on visits to family and friends in endemic areas. Malaria in children (and sometimes in adults) may present with misleading symptoms such as gastrointestinal features, sore throat or lower respiratory complaints; the diagnosis must always be sought in a feverish or very sick child who has visited malaria-endemic areas. Children can be treated with most of the antimalarial regimens which are effective in adults, with appropriate dosage adjustment. Doxycycline plus quinine should not be given to children under 12 years as doxycycline is contraindicated in this age group, but clindamycin can be substituted for doxycycline, and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (Fansidar) may also be an effective substitute. An acute attack of malaria does not confer protection from future attacks: individuals who have had malaria should take effective anti-mosquito precautions and chemoprophylaxis during future visits to endemic areas."
CD008122,0,19232866,0,Detection of dengue nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein in Vietnamese patients with fever.,"Diagnosing dengue in febrile patients is challenging. Of a total of 459 patients with acute undifferentiated fever, randomly selected from 12 primary health facilities and 1 clinic of the provincial malaria station in southern Vietnam, dengue-specific antibody (Ab) and NS1Ag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Platelia, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA 94547, US) were performed on acute (t0) and convalescent (t3 weeks) sera. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for confirmation. Based on a composite of the NS1Ag-ELISA, Ab-ELISA, and PCR results, 54 (12%) patients had acute dengue. Positive and negative predictive values were 65% and 98% for the Ab-based diagnosis and 91% and 92% for NS1Ag, respectively. The agreement between Ab- and NS1Ag-based diagnosis was poor (kappa value, 0.2). Two patients without dengue had detectable NS1Ag on t0 and t3, 1 just above the cutoff value and 1 with very high values. For 5 dengue patients, NS1Ag was still detectable at very high levels at t3. Dengue NS1Ag can be used for early diagnosis of dengue; infrequent false-positive results need further clarification."
CD008122,0,12438363,0,A modified hepatitis B virus core particle containing multiple epitopes of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein provides a highly immunogenic malaria vaccine in preclinical analyses in rodent and primate hosts.,"Despite extensive public health efforts, there are presently 200 to 400 million malaria infections and 1 to 2 million deaths each year due to the Plasmodium parasite. A prime target for malaria vaccine development is the circumsporozoite (CS) protein, which is expressed on the extracellular sporozoite and the intracellular hepatic stages of the parasite. Previous studies in rodent malaria models have shown that CS repeat B-cell epitopes expressed in a recombinant hepatitis B virus core (HBc) protein can elicit protective immunity. To design a vaccine for human use, a series of recombinant HBc proteins containing epitopes of Plasmodium falciparum CS protein were assayed for immunogenicity in mice [A. Birkett, B. Thornton, D. Milich, G. A. Oliveira, A. Siddique, R. Nussenzweig, J. M. Calvo-Calle, and E. H. Nardin, abstract from the 50th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 2001, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 65(Suppl. 3):258, 2001; D. R. Milich, J. Hughes, J. Jones, M. Sallberg, and T. R. Phillips, Vaccine 20:771-788, 2001]. The present paper summarizes preclinical analyses of the optimal P. falciparum HBc vaccine candidate, termed ICC-1132, which contains T- and B-cell epitopes from the repeat region and a universal T-cell epitope from the C terminus of the CS protein. The vaccine was highly immunogenic in mice and in Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus) monkeys. When formulated in adjuvants suitable for human use, the vaccine elicited antisporozoite antibody titers that were logs higher than those obtained in previous studies. Human malaria-specific CD4(+)-T-cell clones and T cells of ICC-1132-immunized mice specifically recognized malaria T-cell epitopes contained in the vaccine. In addition to inducing strong malaria-specific immune responses in naïve hosts, ICC-1132 elicited potent anamnestic antibody responses in mice primed with P. falciparum sporozoites, suggesting potential efficacy in enhancing the sporozoite-primed immune responses of individuals living in areas where malaria is endemic."

The models and the related software program can assist planners in the health sector in determining costs of current programs and assessing the potential economic impact of introducing rapid on-site diagnosis. Details of the models and the operational software program are available on request."
CD008122,0,15099810,0,The use of impregnated curtains does not affect antibody responses against Plasmodium falciparum and complexity of infecting parasite populations in children from Burkina Faso.,"In Burkina Faso, where malaria is hyper-endemic and transmission intensity is very high, the majority of malaria-related morbidity and mortality occurs in children less than 5 years of age. A control measure such as the use of insecticide-treated curtains (ITC) significantly reduces transmission of malaria infection. Concerns remain whether reduced transmission intensity may lead to a delay in the development of immunity in younger children and even to a partial loss of already acquired immunity. In this study, the levels of P. falciparum-specific IgG subclasses, the number of infecting parasite clones determined by PCR-based genotyping of the msp2 gene and the parasite density were analysed in 154 asymptomatic children (3-6 years) living in 16 villages (8 with and 8 without ITC) in the vicinity of Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. In addition, the parasite inhibitory effects of Ig fractions, prepared from selected children, in co-operation with normal human monocytes were studied. Blood samples from asymptomatic ITC-users showed a significant decrease in P. falciparum prevalence as well as in parasite density. However, no significant difference was observed in P. falciparum-specific antibodies or in parasite multiplicity of infection between the two groups. Furthermore, Ig fractions from children of both groups showed similar levels of inhibitory activity against autologous parasite growth both on their own and in co-operation with monocytes."
CD008122,0,19270300,1,Performance of malaria rapid diagnostic tests as part of routine malaria case management in Kenya.,"Data on malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) performance under routine program conditions are limited. We assessed the attributes of RDTs performed by study and health facility (HF) staffs as part of routine malaria case management of patients > or = 5 years of age in Kenya. Expert microscopy was used as our gold standard. A total of 1,827 patients were enrolled; 191 (11.6%) were parasitemic by expert microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of RDTs performed by study staff were 86.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79.8-93.5%) and 95.4% (95% CI: 93.9-96.9%), respectively. Among tests performed by HF staff, RDTs were 91.7% (95% CI: 80.8-100.0%) sensitive and 96.7% (95% CI: 92.8-100.0%) specific, whereas microscopy was 52.5% (95% CI: 33.2-71.9%) sensitive and 77.0% (95% CI: 67.9-86.2%) specific. Our findings suggest that RDTs perform better than microscopy under routine conditions. Further efforts are needed to maintain this high RDT performance over time."
CD008122,0,9764322,1,Comparison of the ParaSight-F test and the ICT Malaria Pf test with the polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in travellers.,"Rapid and accurate methods are needed for the diagnosis of imported malaria. The ParaSight-F test and the ICT Malaria Pf test are commercially available kits marketed for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Both tests are antigen-capture assays based on the detection of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 in peripheral blood. Using microscopy and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method as reference standards, we performed a 'blinded' comparison of these assays for the detection of P. falciparum infection in 200 febrile travellers returning from malaria-endemic areas. As determined by PCR and microscopy, 148 travellers had malaria and, of these patients, 54.7% (81/148) were infected with P. vivax only, 31.1% (46/148) with P. falciparum only, 9.5% (14/148) with P. ovale, 0.7% (1/148) with P. malariae, and 4.1% (6/148) had mixed infections. Compared to PCR, the ParaSight-F and ICT Malaria Pf tests had initial sensitivities of 94% and 90% and specificities of 95% and 97%, respectively, for the detection of P. falciparum malaria. When discrepant samples were retested with day 0 and day 1 bloods, the sensitivities improved to 96% and 94%, respectively. The 2 remaining false negative results with the Para-Sight-F test and 2 of the 3 false negative results with the ICT Malaria Pf test occurred in samples with < 100 parasites/microL. The performance of these kits was not significantly different (P = 0.75) and both are simple, rapid, and accurate tests for the detection of P. falciparum infection in the returned traveller."
CD008122,0,11931266,0,Evaluation of anopheline mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) from the republic of Korea for Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite protein.,"As part of an on-going malaria surveillance effort conducted by the U.S. Forces Korea, Republic of Korea (ROK), a total of 28,286 anopheline mosquitoes was tested for the presence of Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite (CS) protein. Mosquitoes were collected (using a variety of light and baited traps) from 29 locations throughout the ROK (the majority were collected near the de-militarized zone), identified to species, and tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of P. vivax 210 and P. vivax 247 CS protein. Recent evidence suggests that characters used to separate Anopheles sinensis Wiedemann from An. lesteri Baisas & Hu are unreliable; therefore, the data have been analyzed by grouping these two species. A total of 25,365 Anopheles sinensis/lesteri, 2,890 An. yatsushiroensis Miyazaki, and 31 An. sineroides Yamada was tested. Of these, one pool of 10 An. sinensis/lesteri collected on 9 September 1999 at Camp Howze and one pool of nine An. sinensis/ lesteri collected on 13 September 1999 at Camp Bonifas were positive for P. vivax 247."
CD008122,0,11548313,0,[Current malaria situation in the Republic of Uzbekistan].,"Malaria was once one of the most common diseases in Uzbekistan. There were massive epidemics with high mortality rates, wherein 140,000 to 700,000 cases of malaria were recorded. Following large-scale malaria control measures, the disease was eradicated in Uzbekistan in 1961 and the epidemiological situation is still favorable. The natural and climatic conditions that prevail in the Republic of Uzbekistan mean that the country is very susceptible to malaria. There are large water areas varying in type and origin, which provide a habitat for a number of epidemiologically dangerous species of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in a single area. These are Anopheles maculipennis, An. pulcherrimus and An. superpictus. The prevailing temperatures promote rapid growth of vector mosquitoes and parasites and the malaria transmission season is over 5 months long. Seven malaria-transmitting mosquito species have been recently recorded in the Republic. DDT resistance has been so far noted in Anopheles maculipennis, An. hyrcanus and An. bifurcatus. An. superpictus is sensitive to all insecticides used in clinical practice (organophosphorus and organochlorine compounds, HOS, carbamates, pyrethroids). The most dangerous areas for transmitting malaria by importation are the flood plains of the country's main rivers, such as Syrdarya, Amudarya, Chirchik, Surkhana, etc., and rice-growing areas (an area of about 150,000 ha was under rice cultivation in 1999). The Republic is still very subjected to large-scale importations of malaria particularly in the towns and areas along the border with Tajikistan. There has been recently an increase in the incidence of infections imported into the Republic: 27 cases in 1995, 51 in 1996, 52 in 1997, 74 in 1998, and 78 in 1999. Eight regions of Uzbekistan border Tajikistan, their population is over 5.6 million people. In addition, close family ties between the populations of the frontier towns and regions further increase the risk for malaria to be imported and passed on. Noteworthy is the Surkhandaryin region that accounted for 60% of the cases recorded in 1999. The number of towns and villages where malaria occurs for the first time increased (49 and 46 cases in 1999 and 1998, respectively). The number of cases imported into rural areas also increased (70 (83%) cases in 1999 versus 48 (65%) cases in 1998); due to the large populations of malaria mosquitoes, there is a real danger that the disease may spread. In 1999, most cases of malaria were imported from Tajikistan (65 cases or 76% of all cases). There was a case from each of the following countries: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan and 5 cases from Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan. The recorded cases included slighly more men than women (54% vs 46%). There were 10 infected children under 14 years, which was 23.5% of all notified cases. Analyzing various populations showed that 67.1% of the patients visited their relatives in malaria-endemic countries (mostly Tajikistan) and 25.8% migrated from Tajikistan. All the detected cases were confirmed by laboratory tests. As in the past, most cases were tertian (P. vivax) malaria (n = 82 or 96.4% of all cases). Tropical (P. falciparum) malaria was confirmed in 3 (3.5%) cases. These cases had been imported from Tajikistan into the Surkhandaryin region. Seventy seven (91%) cases were detected in the epidemical season. Of them 58 (68.2%) cases were detected during a malaria transmission season. Seven cases who contacted the patients with imported malaria and were infected were recorded in 1999. They included 4 and 3 cases in the Surkhandaryin and Kashkadaryin Regions, respectively. In 1999, there was a decline in the number of malaria patients who needed health care and in the diagnosed malaria cases in therapeutical and prophylactic institutions. Throughout the country, 34 (40%) of the 85 detected cases presented within 3 days of malaria outbreak (68.9% in 1998). Malaria was immediate diagnosed in 43.5% of cases (64.9% in 1998). The remaining cases were diagnosed as having acute respiratory viral infections, tropical and parasitic diseases, viral hepatitis, or influenza. Early diagnosis of malaria was made in 60% of cases (77% in 1998). Three cases of imported tertian malaria were recorded in the Tashkent Region in the first quarter of 2000. They were imported from Tajikistan into rural areas and the patients had been infected during the 1999 season. Epidemiological surveillance of malaria in Uzbekistan is regularly carried out by the general network of health facilities and by the departments of parasitology of state epidemiological surveillance centers in collaboration with medical administrative departments, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the L.M. Isayev Research Institute of Medical Parasitology, and other agencies. Active links are maintained with WHO under the Roll Back Malaria programme. Great emphasis is laid on medical staff training at all levels. During the 1999 epidemiological survey, 672,536 laboratory tests were performed on blood samples from suspected malaria patients and individuals who had visited malaria-endemic countries, 55% of them suffering from fever. A total area of 17 million m2 of dwelling and nondwelling buildings 20 ha of water areas were treated against mosquitoes and the larvivorous fish Gambusia was put into the water areas occupying 6,500 ha. In all cases of malaria, the focus of infection was epidemiologically surveyed and required epidemic preventive measures were implemented. All malaria patients received a full course of radical therapy and recovered completely. The epidemiological surveillance system for malaria is affected by staff shortages at the parasitology departments of state epidemiological surveillance centers and by shortages of microscopes, reagents, sterilizing equipment, insecticides, etc. There are still difficulties in obtaining supplies of primaquine although a small stock is locally available as due to WHO humanitarian assistance. The Epidemiological Malaria Surveillance Programme for the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2000-2004, intended to strengthen the epidemic control capacity of health care facilities, Ministry of Health, is under adoption. The following activities are scheduled for 2000: to plan malaria control activities, including the zoning of the country by the risk of malaria transmission in accordance with republic-leveled directives, instructions, and methodology and WHO recommendations: adjustments to these plans to be made as necessary; to fill vacant posts in the parasitology departments of state epidemiological surveillance centers; to procure stocks of antimalarial drugs, reagents, insecticides, sterilizing equipment, etc., to be paid for from epidemiological service resources; to include malaria issues into certifying tests for physicians, as appropriate for the posts to be occupied and their level of qualifications; to publish posters, brochures, and leaflets about malaria prevention before the malaria transmission season for health education; to hold seminars and meetings for health workers on the etiology of malaria, its clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."
CD008122,0,11548315,0,[Current malaria situation in Turkey].,"Geographically, Turkey is situated in an area where malaria is very risky. The climatic conditions in the region are suitable for the malaria vector to proliferate. Due to agricultural infrastructural changes, GAP and other similar projects, insufficient environmental conditions, urbanization, national and international population moves, are a key to manage malaria control activities. It is estimated that malaria will be a potential danger for Turkey in the forthcoming years. The disease is located largely in south-eastern Anatolia. The Diyarbakir, Batman, Sanliurfa, Siirt, and Mardin districts are the most affected areas. In western districts, like Aydin and Manisa, an increase in the number of indigenous cases can be observed from time to time. This is due to workers moving from malaria districts to western parts to final work. Since these workers cannot be controlled, the population living in these regions get infected from indigenous cases. There were 84,345 malaria cases in 1994 and 82,096 in 1995, they decreased to 60,884 in 1996 and numbered 35,456 in 1997. They accounted for 36,842 and 20,963 in 1998 and 1999, respectively. In Turkey there are almost all cases of P. vivax malaria. There are also P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria cases coming from other countries: There were 321 P. vivax cases, including 2 P. falciparum ones, arriving to Turkey from Iraq in 1995. The P. vivax malaria cases accounted for 229 in 1996, and 67, cases P. vivax including 12 P. falciparum cases, in 1997, and 4 P. vivax cases in 1998 that came from that country. One P. vivax case entered Turkey from Georgia in 1998. The cause of higher incidence of P. vivax cases in 1995, it decreasing in 1999, is the lack of border controls over workers coming to Turkey. The other internationally imported cases are from Syria, Sudan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, India, Azerbaijan, Malaysia, Ghana, Indonesia, Yemen. Our examinations have shown that none of these internationally imported cases are important in transmitting the diseases. The districts where malaria cases occur are the places where population moves are rapid, agriculture is the main occupation, the increase in the population is high and the education/cultural level is low. Within years, the districts with high malaria cases also differ. Before 1990 Cucurova and Amikova were the places that showed the highest incidence of malaria. Since 1990, the number of cases from south-eastern Anatolia has started to rise. The main reasons for this change are a comprehensive malaria prevention programme, regional development, developed agricultural systems, and lower population movements. The 1999 statistical data indicate that 83 and 17% of all malaria cases are observed in the GAP and other districts, respectively. The distribution of malaria cases in Turkey differs by months and climatic conditions. The incidence of malaria starts to rise in March, reaching its peak in July, August and September, begins to fall in October. In other words, the number of malaria cases is lowest in winter and reaches its peak in summer and autumn. This is not due to the parasite itself, but a climatic change is a main reason. In the past years the comprehensive malaria prevention programme has started bearing its fruits. Within the WHO Roll Back Malaria strategies, Turkey has started to implement its national malaria control projects, the meeting held on March 22, 2000, coordinated the country's international cooperation for this purpose. The meeting considered the aim of the project to be introduced into other organizations. In this regards, the target for 2002 is to halve the incidence of malaria as compared to 1999. The middle--and long-term incidence of malaria will be lowered to even smaller figures. The objectives of this project are as follows: to integrate malaria services with primary health care services to prove more effective studies; to develop early diagnosis and treatment systems, to provide better diagnostic services, and to develop mobile diagnostic ones; to make radical treatment and monitoring patients; to conduct regular active case surveillance studies; to conduct regular vector control studies; to monitor the sensitivity of vectors to insecticides and to provide their alternatives; to design malaria control studies for the specialists of districts; to implement educational programmes among the population and attract it in controlling malaria."

In most urban areas, malaria transmission intensity is low thus monitoring trends using reliable tools is crucial to provide vital information for future management of the disease. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) such as Paracheck Pf are now increasingly adopted for Plasmodium falciparum malaria diagnosis and are advantageous and cost effective alternative to microscopy. This cross sectional survey was carried out during June 2005 to determine the prevalence of malaria in an urban setting and compare microscopy diagnosis versus Paracheck Pf for detecting Plasmodium falciparum. Blood samples from a total of 301 children (< 10 years) attending outpatient clinic at Makorora Health Centre, in Tanga, Tanzania were examined for the presence of malaria. Twenty-nine (9.6%) of the children were positive to malaria by microscopy while 30 (10.0%) were positive by Paracheck test. Three out of 30 positive cases detected by Paracheck were negative by microscopy; thus considered to be false positive results. For the 271 Paracheck Pf negative cases, 2 were positive by microscopy; yielding 2 false negative results. Paracheck Pf sensitivity and specificity were 93.1% and 98.9%, respectively. P. falciparum was the only malarial species observed among the 29 microscopy positive cases. The prevalence of anaemia among the children was 53.16%. These findings indicate a low prevalence of malaria in Tanga City and that Paracheck Pf can be an effective tool for malaria diagnosis."

Expectations for malaria diagnostic assays include rapid processing with minimal expertise, very high specificity and sensitivity, and quantitative evaluation of parasitemia to be delivered at a very low cost. Toward fulfilling many of these expectations, we have developed a post-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/ligase detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay (LDR-FMA). This assay, which uses Luminex FlexMAP microspheres, provides simultaneous, semi-quantitative detection of infection by all four human malaria parasite species at a sensitivity and specificity equal to other PCR-based assays. In blinded studies using P. falciparum-infected blood from in vitro cultures, we identified infected and uninfected samples with 100% concordance. Additionally, in analyses of P. falciparum in vitro cultures and P. vivax-infected monkeys, comparisons between parasitemia and LDR-FMA signal intensity showed very strong positive correlations (r > 0.95). Application of this multiplex Plasmodium species LDR-FMA diagnostic assay will increase the speed, accuracy, and reliability of diagnosing human Plasmodium species infections in epidemiologic studies of complex malaria-endemic settings."

The leading symptoms are diarrhoea (68%), fever (20%) and skin conditions (9%), sometimes in combination. The travel history is of decisive importance for the diagnosis. Quite simple questions aimed at identifying the start of the illness, symptoms, destination, travel class and vaccinations can be useful for differentiation purposes. For the acute diagnosis, such aids as urine stick test, centrifuge, microscope, a range of stains, and a stool test for occult blood suffice. The most common serious travel-specific diseases include malaria, falciparum > tertian, dengue fever, hepatitis, and rickettsiosis. When falciparum malaria is suspected (""flu without a runny nose"", and a visit to a tropical country), the patients must be hospitalized.

CD008122,0,15731014,0,Band 3 modifications in Plasmodium falciparum-infected AA and CC erythrocytes assayed by autocorrelation analysis using quantum dots.,"The molecular stability of hemoglobin is critical for normal erythrocyte functions, including oxygen transport. Hemoglobin C (HbC) is a mutant hemoglobin that has increased oxidative susceptibility due to an amino acid substitution (beta6: Glu to Lys). The growth of Plasmodium falciparum is abnormal in homozygous CC erythrocytes in vitro, and CC individuals show innate protection against severe P. falciparum malaria. We investigated one possible mechanism of innate protection using a quantum dot technique to compare the distribution of host membrane band 3 molecules in genotypically normal (AA) to CC erythrocytes. The high photostability of quantum dots facilitated the construction of 3D cell images and the quantification of fluorescent signal intensity. Power spectra and 1D autocorrelation analyses showed band 3 clusters on the surface of infected AA and CC erythrocytes. These clusters became larger as the parasites matured and were more abundant in CC erythrocytes. Further, average cluster size (500 nm) in uninfected (native) CC erythrocytes was comparable with that of parasitized AA erythrocytes but was significantly larger (1 microm) in parasitized CC erythrocytes. Increased band 3 clustering may enhance recognition sites for autoantibodies, which could contribute to the protective effect of hemoglobin C against malaria."

This study was designed to investigate naturally acquired cellular immunity to Pf TRAP in adults from a target population for future trials of TRAP-based vaccines in Kilifi, Kenya. We first tested reactivity to a panel of 53 peptides spanning Pf TRAP and identified 26 novel T-cell epitopes. A panel of naturally occurring polymorphic variant epitope peptides were made to the most commonly recognized epitope regions and tested for ability to elicit IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 production. These data provide for the first time a complex cytokine matrix mapping naturally induced T-cell responses to TRAP and suggest that T-cell responses boosted by vaccination with Pf TRAP could stimulate the release of competing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. They further define polymorphic variants able to boost specific Th1, Th2, and possibly Tr1 reactivity."

An effective blockage of this interaction could be important in anti-malarial vaccine design. This study analyses the genetic polymorphism, binding to both reticulocytes and erythrocytes, antigenicity and immunogenicity of two recombinant proteins belonging to the 33 kDa PvMSP-1 proteolytic fragment. Both regions showed very low genetic variation, bound reticulocytes with higher affinity than erythrocytes, were recognised by naturally P. vivax-infected patient sera and were immunogenic when used to immunise rabbits, making them good vaccine candidates against P. vivax, to be further preclinically tested in the Aotus monkey model."

Transmission blocking vaccines are a potentially powerful component of a multi-faceted public health approach to controlling or eliminating malaria. We report the first phase 1 clinical trial of a P. vivax transmission blocking vaccine in humans. The Pvs25H vaccine is a recombinant protein derived from the Pvs25 surface antigen of P. vivax ookinetes. The protein was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, purified, and adsorbed onto Alhydrogel. Ten volunteers in each of three dose groups (5, 20, or 80 microg) were vaccinated by intramuscular injection in an open-label study at 0, 28 and 180 days. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed. The majority of adverse events causally related to vaccination were mild or moderate in severity. Injection site tenderness was the most commonly observed adverse event. Anti-Pvs25H antibody levels measured by ELISA peaked after the third vaccination. Vaccine-induced antibody is functionally active as evidenced by significant transmission blocking activity in the membrane feeding assay. Correlation between antibody concentration and degree of inhibition was observed. Pvs25H generates transmission blocking immunity in humans against P. vivax demonstrating the potential of this antigen as a component of a transmission blocking vaccine."

Palo Alto isolate or P. falciparum blood from patients with different parasitemias was used. The average cut-off points for each technique in three independent experiments were 12 and 71 parasites/mm3 (TBS and Malar-Check, respectively). In the field assays, samples were collected from patients with fever who visited endemic regions. Compared to TBS, Malar-Check yielded true-positive results in 38 patients, false-positive results in 3, true-negative results in 23, and false-negative result in 1. Malar-Check performed with samples from falciparum-infected patients after treatment showed persistence of antigen up to 30 days. Malar-Check should aid the diagnosis of P. falciparum in remote areas and improve routine diagnosis even when microscopy is available. Previous P. falciparum infection, which can determine a false-positive test in cured individuals, should be considered. The prompt results obtained with the Malar-Check for early diagnosis could avoid disease evolution to severe cases."

The study group consisted of 66 hospitalized patients with clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 70 trauma patients without clinical AIDS (controls). Mean optical densities of antibody produced against RESA-4, RESA-8, RESA-11, (PNAN)5 and (NAAG)5 synthetic peptides of Plasmodium falciparum were compared between HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative patients using non-parametric statistics. HIV-1 seropositive patients with clinical AIDS had significantly less antibody to the synthetic P. falciparum ring stage peptide, RESA-8 (P = 0.001), than a comparable group of seronegative patients. Antibody levels were also low for the other ring stage peptides, RESA-4 (P = 0.024) and RESA-11 (P = 0.024). Although not statistically significant, antibody levels among the HIV-1 seropositive trauma patients were higher than among the HIV-1 seronegative trauma patients. During HIV-1 infection, a polyclonal B cell activation may occur as noted in the HIV-1 seropositive trauma patients, but with increased immunosuppression in advanced clinical AIDS, B cell stimulation appears to be diminished. This results in decreased production of malaria antibody."

Specific antibody-antigen complex is known to trigger the metabolic activation of normal PMN, as measured by NBT-test. In the sera from 16 out of 17 patients tested the NBT-reduction of normal PMN was, in the presence of P. falciparum antigen, significantly higher than that obtained with pooled normal serum from individuals without malaria background. This enhancement was more pronounced in the presence of complement. NBT-reduction was elevated to a lower extent when human anti-P. falciparum sera were substituted with anti-P. vivax or P. ovale sera. Furthermore, no enhancement was noted when red blood cells lysate was used as antigen. The results indicated the presence of specific opsonizing antibodies against P. falciparum in the patient sera. Oxygen-derived free radicals formed by PMN during the stimulation are suggested as the neutrophil mediated protection against malaria."
CD008122,0,14720085,0,Antimalarial drug toxicity: a review.,"Malaria, caused mostly by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Antimalarial drug toxicity is one side of the risk-benefit equation and is viewed differently depending upon whether the clinical indication for drug administration is malaria treatment or prophylaxis. Drug toxicity must be acceptable to patients and cause less harm than the disease itself. Research that leads to drug registration tends to omit two important groups who are particularly vulnerable to malaria--very young children and pregnant women. Prescribing in pregnancy is a particular problem for clinicians because the risk-benefit ratio is often very unclear. The number of antimalarial drugs in use is very small. Despite its decreasing efficacy against P. falciparum, chloroquine continues to be used widely because of its low cost and good tolerability. It remains the drug of first choice for treating P. vivax malaria. Pruritus is a common adverse effect in African patients. As prophylaxis, chloroquine is usually combined with proguanil. This combination has good overall tolerability but mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal upset are more common than with other prophylactic regimens. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is well tolerated as treatment and when used as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant African women. Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is no longer used as prophylaxis because it may cause toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens Johnson syndrome. Mefloquine remains a valuable drug for prophylaxis and treatment. Tolerability is acceptable to most patients and travellers despite the impression given by the lay press. Dose-related serious neuropsychiatric toxicity can occur; mefloquine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of epilepsy or psychiatric disease. Quinine is the mainstay for treating severe malaria in many countries. Cardiovascular or CNS toxicity is rare, but hypoglycaemia may be problematic and blood glucose levels should be monitored. Halofantrine is unsuitable for widespread use because of its potential for cardiotoxicity. There is renewed interest in two old drugs, primaquine and amodiaquine. Primaquine is being developed as prophylaxis, and amodiaquine, which was withdrawn from prophylactic use because of neutropenia and hepatitis, is a potentially good partner drug for artesunate against falciparum malaria. Atovaquone/proguanil is a new antimalarial combination with good efficacy and tolerability as prophylaxis and treatment. The most important class of drugs that could have a major impact on malaria control is the artemisinin derivatives. They have remarkable efficacy and an excellent safety record. They have no identifiable dose-related adverse effects in humans and only very rarely produce allergic reactions. Combining an artemisinin derivative with another efficacious antimalarial drug is increasingly being viewed as the optimal therapeutic strategy for malaria."

This area of 29000 inhabitants, has been for several decades, a regional observatory for population and health. The three methods used for collecting mosquitoes were the collection at larval stages, the all night human biting collection, and the pyrethrum spray catch in houses during afternoons. The anophelines collected were, by numerical importance: Anopheles arabiensis, An. rufipes, An. gambiae, An. pharoensis, An. funestus and An. coustani. In the An. gambiae complex, An. arabiensis represented 97% of man biting females and 98% of half gravid resting females (difference not significant); the other reminding species of this complex was always An. gambiae. These two species belonging to the An. gambiae complex were responsible for the totality of the transmission. The anthropophilic index, obtained from half gravid indoor resting An. gambiae s.l., was 83%. The annual biting rate of An. gambiae s.l. varied from 512 to 1558 bites per man per night, depending on the villages. Vectors were observed all year long but their densities were low during the dry season. Vector population presented a notable increase due to the rains, with a maximum of about 10 bites per man per night in September or at the beginning of October; during September the biting rate represented 48% of the annual biting rate. The sporozoitic index of An. gambiae s.l., obtained by ELISA revealing the circumsporozoite protein, was 1.6% for human biting females and 1.8% for half-gravid resting females (difference not significant). Plasmodium falciparum was the only plasmodial species observed among infected anophelines. The annual transmission in the vo villages representative of the Niakhar area were 9 and 12 bites of infected anophelines per man, occurring mainly from August to October. In the third village, not representative of the area regarding permanent breeding places, the transmission was 26 bites of infected anopheline per man per year.

Aliquots of washed blood from gametocyte carriers were resuspended in test and control sera and fed to An. gambiae mosquitoes via a membrane feeder. Comparisons of the prevalence and intensity of infections is dissected mosquitoes showed variations in the ability of sera to block the transmission of the different isolates. Sera were identified that had little or no blocking effect on the transmission of isolates unless the isolate was poorly infectious. Some sera completely blocked the transmission of some isolates whilst having little or no effect on others. The observed variation in transmission-modulating activity may have implications for the development of a transmission-blocking vaccine.

Chloroquine resistance had not been documented in the study area; pyrimethamine resistance was probably present but uncommon. Children who received weekly chemoprophylaxis with pyrimethamine had a lower prevalence of malaria parasitaemia and malaria antibodies than children who received weekly chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine. Pyrimethamine given monthly gave a comparable degree of protection to chloroquine given weekly. Chloroquine frequently induced vomiting in young children and this may have impaired its efficacy as a prophylactic. We conclude that, in an area where neither chloroquine nor pyrimethamine resistance is prevalent, pyrimethamine is a better chemoprophylactic for young children than chloroquine."

A major concern relating to this approach is that, in time, it will be compromised by the selection of mosquito genotypes that are resistant at the biochemical or behavioural level. We report entomological data from a large area in Burkina Faso where insecticide-treated curtains have been in use for up to 5 years. Longitudinal indoor and outdoor CDC light-trap catches were performed in 4 sentinel villages. In addition cross-sectional surveys using indoor spray catches and outdoor CDC light-trap catches were performed each September in a larger number of villages, including 8 located outside the intervention area. We found no evidence of the selection of mosquito phenotypes that might compromise the intervention. Indoor and outdoor vector densities remained very low after 5 years of intervention, both compared with pre-intervention levels and with concurrent levels outside the intervention area. We found no evidence of a switch to outdoor rather than indoor biting. The proportion of blood meals taken on humans may have decreased but our data are inconclusive on this point. We observed higher vector densities and sporozoite rates at the periphery of the intervention zone than at the centre, which may reflect re-invasion of peripheral villages by mosquitoes from outside the intervention area. In 'real life' programmes, with perhaps patchy, less than optimal coverage, the protection against malaria transmission provided to individuals using insecticide-treated materials may be less than that achieved in the randomized controlled trials which demonstrated an impact of insecticide-treated materials on child mortality."

An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay designed to detect IFN-gamma at the single-cell level was used to study IFN-gamma-producing cells from P. falciparum-primed donors from The Gambia after in vitro stimulation with various malarial antigens. IFN-gamma secreted into the culture supernatant was measured by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a good correlation in individual donors between the level of IFN-gamma secreted into the culture supernatant and the number of IFN-gamma-secreting cells. However, the ELISPOT assay was apparently more sensitive in demonstrating low levels of IFN-gamma production than the ELISA was. Thus after stimulation with crude P. falciparum antigen from infected erythrocytes, 72% of the primed donors responded positively in the ELISPOT assay but only 55% responded positively in the ELISA. When stimulated with synthetic peptides representing immunodominant epitopes of the malarial antigen Pf155/RESA, a vaccine candidate, 31 to 55% responded in the ELISPOT assay and 21 to 36% responded in the ELISA. Unprimed Europeans did not respond positively to these antigens in either of the assays, and background in antigen-free controls was generally low. These results indicate that measurement of IFN-gamma by the ELISPOT assay or ELISA should have wide applications in large-scale epidemiological studies of malaria immunity. In addition, the ELISPOT assay makes it possible to analyze the T cells responding to malarial antigens in terms of both numbers and functional heterogeneity."
CD008122,0,19164769,0,A calpain unique to alveolates is essential in Plasmodium falciparum and its knockdown reveals an involvement in pre-S-phase development.,"Plasmodium falciparum encodes a single calpain that has a distinct domain composition restricted to alveolates. To evaluate the potential of this protein as a drug target, we assessed its essentiality. Both gene disruption by double cross-over and gene truncation by single cross-over recombination failed. We were also unable to achieve allelic replacement by using a missense mutation at the catalytic cysteine codon, although we could obtain synonymous allelic replacement parasites. These results suggested that the calpain gene and its proteolytic activity are important for optimal parasite growth. To gain further insight into its biological role, we used the FKBP degradation domain system to generate a fusion protein whose stability in transfected parasites could be modulated by a small FKBP ligand, Shield1 (Shld1). We made a calpain-GFP-FKBP fusion through single cross-over integration at the endogenous calpain locus. Calpain levels were knocked down and parasite growth was greatly impaired in the absence of Shld1. Parasites were delayed in their ability to transition out of the ring stage and in their ability to progress to the S phase. Calpain is required for cell cycle progression in Plasmodium parasites and appears to be an attractive drug target. We have shown that regulated knockdowns are possible in P. falciparum and can be useful for evaluating essentiality and function."
CD008122,0,9158055,0,Lack of malaria parasite transmission between apes and humans in Gabon.,"The International Center for Medical Research (CIRMF) is located in an area highly endemic for malaria in southeastern Gabon, where humans and apes (gorillas and chimpanzees) are living in the same geographic area. The presence of the CIRMF primate center housing apes (59 chimpanzees and nine gorillas in 1994) within the city of Franceville provided an opportunity to investigate the capability of cross-transmission of malaria species from humans to apes. The main vector of human malaria, Anopheles gambiae, was found in the primate center and in a nearby populated area of Franceville. Despite high malaria transmission in humans of both Plasmodium falciparum and P. malariae (mean of 43% cumulative prevalence in schoolchildren), none of the apes were found infected with plasmodia during a six-month investigation. However, low antibody levels against sporozoite and blood stages of both P. falciparum and P. malariae were detected in a few chimpanzees and gorillas. These results demonstrate that only rarely would apes be bitten in the field by mosquitoes infected with human malaria parasites. In the case of infection proven by serology, we did not find any evidence that blood-stage malaria parasites were able to the gametocyte stage. The absence of any established malaria transmission cycle within the primate colony of CIRMF indicates that apes cannot be considered as animal reservoirs for human malaria parasites in this environment."

CD008122,0,1852133,0,A killing disease epidemic among displaced Sudanese population identified as visceral leishmaniasis.,"A fatal disease epidemic affected the Bentiu area in southern Sudan and led to a mass migration of the Nuer tribe searching for treatment. The initially available information revealed a high mortality rate due to a possible occurrence of tuberculosis, malaria, enteric fever or visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Serological screening of 53 of the most severely affected patients in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or an improved direct agglutination test (DAT) revealed positivity for VL. In 39 of those patients, diagnosis was confirmed by identification of Leishmania donovani amastigotes in lymph node or bone-marrow aspirates. In a total of 2714 patients observed, 1195 (44.0%) had clinical symptoms suggesting VL: DAT positive titers (1:3200-greater than or equal to 1:12800) were obtained in 654 (24.1%), of whom 325 were confirmed parasitologically. Forty-two VL cases died before or during treatment, giving a mortality rate of 6.4%. Among the intercurrent infections diagnosed in the VL population (654), respiratory involvements (31.7%) and malaria (10.7%) were most prevalent. With the exception of four (0.6%), all other VL patients (509) responded readily to sodium stibogluconate. The factors initiating the outbreak are discussed. Malnutrition and nomadic movements to potential VL endemic areas appeared to be the most important. HIV infection as a possible predisposition seemed remote considering the clinical and epidemiological similarity to VL occurring in East Africa, adequate humoral response in DAT, and immediate positive response to specific anti-Leishmania chemotherapy."
CD008122,0,2901568,0,Hypohaptoglobinaemia as an epidemiological and clinical indicator for malaria. Results of two studies in a hyperendemic region in West Africa.,"Hypohaptoglobinaemia is a common phenomenon in tropical countries, where it is probably due to malaria-induced haemolysis. Two studies were carried out in a hyperendemic zone of West Africa to test its specificity and usefulness as an epidemiological indicator for measuring malaria endemicity. The first study evaluated the prevalence of hypohaptoglobinaemia before and after courses of antimalarial chemotherapy of varying duration. The second monitored haptoglobin levels in an untreated population during a whole year to compare its seasonal variations with those of several classic indicators of malaria. These studies suggest that in regions where malaria is endemic the prevalence of hypohaptoglobinaemia could be as useful an indicator as the parasitic index but would be much easier to establish and to monitor."
CD008122,0,7019161,0,Quantitative carbon-14 autoradiography at the cellular level: principles and application for cell kinetic studies.,"Amounts of radio-labelled substances as low as 10(-18) moles incorporated into individual cells can be measured by utilizing techniques of quantitative autoradiography. For this purpose, radioactive standard sources are processed with the labelled cells smeared to slides. Carbon-14 is a favourable isotope with regard to minimal loss of beta-disintegrations due to self-absorption, and to limited cross-fire effects complicating the attribution of silver grains to individual cells. Silver grain densities can be counted by automated microphotometry allowing on-line data processing by an interfaced computer. Rate measurements of 14C-thymidine incorporation into individual cells yield values of the DNA synthesis rate provided that the endogenous pathway of thymidine-phosphate formation has been previously blocked. From the rate values of individual cells the DNA synthesis time of a cell compartment is derived. This is an essential time parameter for the evaluation of kinetic events in proliferating cell populations. This method is applicable to human cells without radiation hazard to man, and provides an optimal source of detailed information on the kinetics of normal and diseased human haematopoiesis. Examples of application consist of thalassaemia, malaria infection, iron deficiency anaemia and acute myelogenous leukaemia."

CD008122,0,10523567,0,Comparison of the OptiMAL test with PCR for diagnosis of malaria in immigrants.,"The OptiMAL test (Flow Inc., Portland, Oreg.), which detects a malaria parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigen, has not been evaluated for its sensitivity in the diagnosis of malaria infection in various epidemiological settings. Using microscopy and a PCR as reference standards, we performed a comparison of these assays with the OptiMAL test for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection in 550 immigrants who had come from areas where malaria is endemic to reside in Kuwait, where malaria is not endemic. As determined by microscopy, 125 (23%) patients had malaria, and of these, 84 (67%) were infected with P. vivax and 36 were infected with P. falciparum; in 5 cases the parasite species could not be determined due to a paucity of the parasites. The PCR detected malaria infection in 145 (26%) patients; 102 (70%) of the patients had P. vivax infection and 43 had P. falciparum infection. Of the five cases undetermined by microscopy, the PCR detected P. falciparum infection in two cases, P. vivax infection in two cases, and mixed (P. falciparum plus P. vivax) infection in one case. Correspondingly, the OptiMAL test detected malaria infection in 95 patients (17%); of these, 70 (74%) had P. vivax infection and 25 were infected with P. falciparum. In this study, 61 (49%) of the 125 malaria cases, as confirmed by microscopy, had a degree of parasitemia of <100 parasites per microl, and 23 (18%) of the cases had a degree of <50 parasites per microl. Our results show that the sensitivity of the OptiMAL test is high (97%) at a high level of parasitemia (>100 parasites/microl) but drops to 59% when the level is <100 parasites/microl and to 39% when it is <50 parasites/microl. In addition, the OptiMAL test failed to identify four patients whose blood smears contained P. falciparum gametocytes only. We conclude that the sensitivity and specificity of the OptiMAL test are comparable to those of microscopy in detecting malaria infection at a parasitemia level of >100 parasites/microl; however, the test failed to identify more than half of the patients with a parasitemia level of <50 parasites/microl. Thus, the OptiMAL test should be used with great caution, and it should not replace conventional microscopy in the diagnosis of malaria infection."

CD008122,0,9030663,0,Plasmodium falciparum: an epitope within a highly conserved region of the 47-kDa amino-terminal domain of the serine repeat antigen is a target of parasite-inhibitory antibodies.,"Previously, the Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen has been shown to be protective in primate models of malaria immunity and also to be a target of in vitro parasite-inhibitory antibodies. To further define parasite-inhibitory epitopes a series of deletions from the amino-terminal 47-kDa domain of the serine repeat antigen (SERA) were constructed as glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins. Several GST-SERA fusion proteins were used to vaccinate mice with Freund's adjuvant and the resulting immune sera were used to assay for the inhibition of P. falciparum invasion of erythrocytes in vitro. The minimal epitope shown to be the target of invasion-blocking antibodies was SERA amino acids 17-165. Additional GST-SERA deletion constructs of the 47-kDa domain were developed and evaluated for reactivity, by Western immunoblot analysis, with a parasite-inhibitory murine monoclonal antibody (mAb 43E5), a parasite-inhibitory pooled goat polyclonal sera, and a pooled human Nigerian immune serum. The parasite-inhibitory epitope defined by mAb 43E5 was mapped to SERA amino acids 17-110 and, at least, part of the epitope was defined to include amino acids in the region of amino acids 59-72. The parasite-inhibitory epitope recognized by mAb 43E5 appears to be well conserved between diverse geographical isolates of P. falciparum. The results have relevance for malaria vaccine development and suggest that an appropriately designed recombinant SERA antigen produced from a synthetic gene in Escherichia coli may be an effective component of a candidate malaria vaccine."

The biological activity of Ro 42-1611 was confirmed as it blocked Plasmodium falciparum growth in cultures. Ro 42-1611, had no major effect on TNF, IL-alpha or IL-6 cytokine release from mononuclear cells stimulated with malaria antigens or lipopolysaccharide and it did not affect cell viability. Ro 42-1611 only slightly suppressed cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to melanoma cells. The therapeutic effect of To 42-1611 appears to be confined to its parasite killing activity."
CD008122,0,8533016,0,Evaluation of circumsporozoite antibody testing as a sero-epidemiological tool for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection in non-immune travelers.,"The objective of this investigation was to collect data concerning CS-antibody levels and duration of the immunological response to exposure of non-immune persons to a single malaria infection. For this purpose 156 specimens from 98 patients with confirmed falciparum malaria, 76 specimen derived from 64 patients with vivax malaria and sera from 32 patients who had not been previously to malarious areas were investigated by use of a commercially available ELISA testkit. All specimens from patients with falciparum malaria were also tested for merozoite-antibodies by an indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Positive levels of merozoite-antibodies were detectable in 89.1% of the specimen in this panel during the period between days 8 and 90 after onset of symptoms and decreased steadily thereafter. The test results were positive for CS-antibodies in 36.4% of the specimens from patients with falciparum malaria during the first 7 days after onset of symptoms. This figure increased to 55.8% during days 8-90 after onset and decreased to 38.9% in specimens which were tested later (91-1898 days). 11 specimens reacted positively to CS-antibody testing but negative in the IFAT. Therefore, the percentage of specimen detected by either IFAT or CS-ELISA was at 51.9% during days 0 and 7 (p < 0.001), 95.3% during days 8 and 90 (p = 0.039) and 44.4% for testing performed later (p < 0.001). CS-antibodies could also be detected in 5.3% of specimen from patients with vivax malaria while none of the sera from the malaria-negative control-group tested positive for CS-antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008122,0,11687239,0,"Expression of the chemokine MIG is a sensitive and predictive marker for antigen-specific, genetically restricted IFN-gamma production and IFN-gamma-secreting cells.","The evaluation of antigen-specific immune responses is critical for understanding the mechanisms of immune protection and for establishing the efficacy of candidate vaccines. Here, we describe a novel assay for IFN-gamma activity which is based on the flow cytometric detection of the chemokine, monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG) as a sensitive and predictive measure of IFN-gamma-mediated effector function, and a surrogate marker for IFN-gamma-producing cells. Upregulation of MIG expression was demonstrated following in vitro activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with defined CD8+ T-cell epitopes derived from influenza virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and was antigen-specific, genetically restricted and dependent on both CD8+ T cells and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, antigen-specific MIG expression was also demonstrated with Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) peptides, using PBMCs from volunteers immunized with irradiated P. falciparum sporozoites. In multiple parallel experiments, the MIG assay was compared to conventional IFN-gamma ELISPOT, IFN-gamma ELISA, MIG ELISA and intracellular cytokine staining assays. The level of MIG expression was shown to be directly associated with the number of IFN-gamma spot-forming cells (SFCs) detected by ELISPOT (r2=0.94). Moreover, in all instances where cultures were considered positive by ELISPOT, a higher stimulation index was noted with the MIG assay as compared with the ELISPOT assay (on average at least threefold higher) and, in some cases, responses as detected by the MIG assay were significant, but the corresponding response as measured by ELISPOT was not significant. Finally, the flow-based MIG assay offers a number of practical and technical advantages over the ELISPOT assay. Our data validate this novel method for the detection of low as well as high levels of antigen-specific and genetically restricted IFN-gamma activity."

CD008122,0,10444878,1,Evaluation of a rapid and inexpensive dipstick assay for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Rapid, accurate and affordable methods are needed for the diagnosis of malaria. Reported here is an evaluation of a new immunochromatographic strip, the PATH Falciparum Malaria IC Strip, which is impregnated with an immobilized IgM monoclonal antibody that binds to the HRP-II antigen of Plasmodium falciparum. In contrast to other commercially available kits marketed for the rapid diagnosis of falciparum malaria, this kit should be affordable in the malaria-endemic world. Using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods as reference standards, we compared two versions of the PATH test for the detection of P. falciparum infection in 200 febrile travellers. As determined by PCR and microscopy, 148 travellers had malaria, 50 of whom (33.8%) were infected with P. falciparum. Compared with PCR, the two versions of the PATH test had initial sensitivities of 90% and 88% and specificities of 97% and 96%, respectively, for the detection of falciparum malaria. When discrepant samples were retested blindly with a modified procedure (increased sample volume and longer washing step) the sensitivity and specificity of both kits improved to 96% and 99%, respectively. The two remaining false negatives occurred in samples with < 100 parasites per microliter of blood. The accuracy, simplicity and predicted low cost may make this test a useful diagnostic tool in malaria-endemic areas."
CD008122,0,2098469,0,Effect of indoor residual spraying of DDT and bendiocarb on the feeding patterns of Anopheles pseudopunctipennis in Mexico.,"Intense and persistent use of DDT for malaria control has increased resistance and induced exophilic behavior of Anopheles pseudopunctipennis. An evaluation of bendiocarb and DDT to control this species in Sinaloa, Mexico, showed that, in spite of DDT-resistance, both insecticides produced similar effects. Feeding patterns were analyzed to explain these results. Resting mosquitoes were collected over the dry and wet seasons. Anophelines were tested in an ELISA to determine the source of the meals. The human blood index (HBI) ranged from 3.3 to 6.8% in DDT- and from 12.7 to 26.9% in bendiocarb-sprayed houses. Irritability and repellency in DDT-sprayed houses could explain the reduced HBI. In contrast, bendiocarb produced higher mortality. These effects could have affected different components of the vectorial capacity and similarly reduced malaria."

Plasmodium vivax is completely dependent on interaction with the Duffy blood group antigen to invade human erythrocytes. The P. vivax Duffy-binding protein, which binds the Duffy antigen during invasion, belongs to a family of erythrocyte-binding proteins that also includes Plasmodium falciparum sialic acid binding protein and Plasmodium knowlesi Duffy binding protein. The receptor binding domains of these proteins lie in a conserved, N-terminal, cysteine-rich region, region II, found in each of these proteins. Here, we have expressed P. vivax region II (PvRII), the P. vivax Duffy binding domain, in Escherichia coli. Recombinant PvRII is incorrectly folded and accumulates in inclusion bodies. We have developed methods to refold and purify recombinant PvRII in its functional conformation. Biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterization confirms that recombinant PvRII is pure, homogeneous, and functionally active in that it binds Duffy-positive human erythrocytes with specificity. Refolded PvRII is highly immunogenic and elicits high titer antibodies that can inhibit binding of P. vivax Duffy-binding protein to erythrocytes, providing support for its development as a vaccine candidate for P. vivax malaria. Development of methods to produce functionally active recombinant PvRII is an important step for structural studies as well as vaccine development."
CD008122,0,10417667,0,Serological responses of Gambian children to immunization with the malaria vaccine SPf66.,"Antibody responses to the malaria vaccine SPf66 and to its constituent peptides were measured over a period of 2 years in Gambian children who had been immunized with SPf66 or with a control vaccine (inactivated polio vaccine). Three hundred and six of 308 children (99%) who had received three doses of SPf66 vaccine had antibodies to SPf66 at a level above that found in European controls who had not been exposed to malaria. Responses to the constituent peptides derived from 35.1, 55.1 and 83.1-kDa proteins were found in 88%, 97% and 97% of children, respectively; 26% had an antibody response to the NANP repeat peptide of circumsporozoite protein which is also included in the SPf66 vaccine. A response to SPf66 was found in 22% of children who had received the control vaccine. Antibody responses to NANP, 35.1, 55.1 and 83.1-kDa peptide were found in 3%, 33%, 49% and 33% of these children. Overall, no significant correlation was found between the level of anti-SPf66 antibody at the beginning of the malaria transmission season following vaccination and the subsequent risk of malaria. However, further analysis showed that among the control children who had acquired antibodies to SPf66 as a result of natural exposure to malaria, those with high levels of anti-SPf66 were less at risk of malaria, perhaps reflecting their greater previous exposure and thus immunity. In contrast, among children who had received three doses of SPf66, those with high antibody levels were at greater risk of have malaria during the subsequent malaria transmission season."

In addition, the immunogenicity of long polypeptides corresponding to the amino (N) and carboxyl (C) regions was evaluated in Aotus monkeys. The epitopes recognized after natural infection of humans and after immunization of Aotus with these synthetic peptides were compared. Human samples more frequently contained specific antibodies to the central region. The type-I repeat region of the CSP was predominantly recognized by the human sera (by 68% of those from the village of Zacarías and 75% of those from Bajo Calima), a significantly smaller population reacting with the type-II repeat (20% and 11%, respectively). Most of the sera reacting with the type-I repeat recognized the minimal epitope AGDR. Although the N- and C-terminal polypeptides were both highly immunogenic in Aotus and induced long-lasting antibodies, titres of antibodies to the C-terminal polypeptide were higher than those of antibodies to the N-terminal. Competitive inhibition assays performed using human and monkey plasma allowed the identification of dominant B-cell epitopes on sequence 71-90 (p8) from the amino region and sequence 332-361 (p24/p25) from the carboxyl region. The high prevalence of naturally induced antibodies to the three epitopes, the possible functional role of the corresponding sequences, and the high immunogenicity of these epitopes in Aotus could be of great importance in the development of a malaria vaccine based on P. vivax CSP."

Coinfections caused by HIV and by Strongyloides are the best documented. As a rule, HTLV1 seems to have rather a worsening effect on evolutiveness and on seriousness of the clinical picture caused by mixed infections, than the contrary (possibly for lack of experience and owing to slow evolution of HTLV1 pathology). Several mechanisms have been proposed concerning coinfections with HTLV1 and HIV (in vitro studies). --Immortalization of CD4 lymphocytes infected with HTLV1 by stimulating both IL2 and its receptor, and by activating lymphocytes with translocation of the replicating factor NF k B in the nucleus, on a promoting sequence of HIV-LTR by stimulating its replication. --The product of HTLV1 tax gene would also have a transactivating effect on the provirus HIV-LTR replication. And finally infection with HTLV1 may facilitate HIV by inducing CD4, molecule expression in non-expressing cells. In Strongyloides modulating effects of HTLV1 on the immune response would facilitate and predispose Strongyloides stercoralis multiplication. As far as other coinfections are concerned (caused by viruses, by parasites: such as malaria, filariasis, trypanosomiasis or by bacteria), epidemiological convergence (risk factors, and geographic distribution) on the one hand, and immunological dysregulation induced by the other, on the other hand, would be of varying importance. In conclusion, these data ask more questions than they answer. But it seems to be established that detection of HIV and Strongyloides should performed in every case HTLV1 carries and vice versa."

In vitro activation of cell cultures with two synthetic peptides (EENVEHDA)4, and (LGRSGGDIIKMQTL) corresponding to immunodominant T cell epitopes of the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (Pf155/RESA) gave specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in five and six of the 15 P. falciparum-primed donors from Cameroon. Antibodies produced after a stimulation by synthetic peptides reacted also with total parasite proteins. However, crude P. falciparum antigen did not trigger a higher number of cells than did synthetic peptides. The absence of significant relation between the presence of sera antibodies and in vitro ASC against the same peptide suggests that the kinetics of circulating primed lymphocytes and antibodies are different. We evaluated 0.04-0.29% of peripheral blood B cells to be the frequency of memory cells specific to a single Pf155/RESA epitope in these donors. This study suggests that the ELISPOT assay should permit the analysis of B cell responses to malarial antigens at the single-cell level and its applicability to epidemiological field studies. This assay should be well suited to the identification of T helper epitopes capable of inducing the production of antibodies by human B cells, and will constitute an important tool for the selection of immunogens to be included in a subunit vaccine."

To evaluate a new DNA extraction technique using nested PCR, blood samples were collected from 132 individuals who presented to Infectious Diseases Department in Rashid Hospital, Dubai, and Central Department of Malaria Control with fever and persistent headache. Giemsa-stained blood films and ELISA test for malaria antibodies were carried out for detection of Plasmodium infection. Plasmodium infections were identified with the genus-specific primer set and species differentiation using nested PCR. A rapid procedure for diagnosis of malaria infections directly from dried blood spots using for the first time DNA extract from FTA Elute cards was evaluated in contrast to extraction techniques using FTA classic cards and rapid boiling technique. Our new simple technique for DNA extraction using FTA Elute cards was very sensitive giving a sensitivity of 100% compared to 94% using FTA classic cards and 62% in the rapid boiling technique. No complex preparation of blood samples was required prior to the amplification. The production cost of DNA isolation in our PCR assay was much less in comparable to that of other DNA extraction protocols. The nested PCR detected plasmodial infection and could differentiate P. falciparum from P. vivax, and also detected the mixed infection."

They also bound to 9-OAcSGs on hematopoietic cells of patients with VL and to epitopes in the cytosol of Leishmania donovani promastigotes. A novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed that showed 4-fold higher anti-OAcSG titers in VL patients (n=38), mean +/- S.E.M. being 0.83 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.04 detected in normal donors (n=20) and patients with cross-reactive diseases such as malaria (n=4) or tuberculosis (n=4). Assay specificity and sensitivity was 100% and 92%, respectively, whereas positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 90%, respectively. Significantly, anti-OAcSG titers declined 30 days after completion of anti-leishmanial treatment, indicating that monitoring of anti-9-OAcSGs may be a valuable alternative toward increasing the efficiency of diagnosis and follow-up of VL."

CD008122,0,1557232,0,"Anti-circumsporozoite protein antibodies measure age related exposure to malaria in Kataragama, Sri Lanka.","Antibodies to two peptides DDAAD and (NANP)40 representing the repetitive sequence of circumsporozoite antigens (CS protein) of P. vivax and P. falciparum respectively were measured in a cohort of 149 and 107 individuals respectively at four, 6 monthly blood surveys performed on residents of Kataragama, a P. vivax malaria endemic region in southern Sri Lanka. The prevalence of antibodies to the CS protein of both species was relatively low being less than 20% to either peptide in the population as a whole, this being consistent with the low entomological inoculation rates in the area. A marked age related prevalence pattern was evident, with the prevalence of antibodies increasing with age to reach between 25 to 30% in the 25-50 year age group in both P. vivax and P. falciparum. The population had had a life long exposure to P. vivax malaria but not to P. falciparum, an epidemic of which occurred in this region a few months prior to the beginning of this study. Nevertheless, the age-related prevalence of these antibodies was identical with respect to the two species. This suggests that the age-related prevalence pattern reflected differences in inoculation rates between the age groups due to differences in exposure to inoculation rather than an age acquired response resulting from a cumulative experience over several years. An analysis of antibody prevalence in individuals showed first, that sporozoite inoculations must have been clustered rather than homogeneously distributed in the population and secondly, that sero-conversion did not correlate with malaria infections in these individuals."
CD008122,0,6437727,0,Immunodiagnostic tests for protozoan and helminthic infections.,"Immunodiagnostic tests for human protozoan and helminthic infections are reviewed. The need for immunodiagnostic tests varies with each infection but is of paramount importance in those infections that cannot be parasitologically diagnosed readily such as toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis, Chagas' disease, trichinosis, hydatidosis, cysticercosis, and visceral larva migrans. Immunoassays are also needed for those worldwide highly prevalent infections with severe morbidity to be used in seroepidemiology and in the follow-up evaluation of control programs. The most important are malaria, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and trypanosomiasis. Major advances have been made in the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a practical and rapid test for use in endemic countries and in the identification and isolation of diagnostic parasite antigens aided in particular by the use of monoclonal antibodies. Development of immunodiagnostic tests for specific parasite antigens in body fluids for many infections is being actively pursued."

Its effects on the maternal malaria immunity.,"The malaria immune status of pregnant women participating in a malaria prophylaxis study was assessed using their sera reactivity to the R32tet32 antigen. Supervised prophylaxis started early in pregnancy till delivery. Women randomly received either chloroquine once weekly (CQ), or proguanil daily (PROG), or a combination of the two drugs (CQ + PROG). Blood was collected at enrollment, then after 8, 16, and 24 weeks of prophylaxis. Of the 312 women who received prophylaxis for more than 10 consecutive weeks before delivery, anti-sporozoite antibodies were assayed in 232 at enrollment, 258 after 8 weeks, and 254 after 16 weeks. Titres at enrollment were comparable by parity and the residential area. Antibodies in women of the PROG group who were parasitaemic before the assessments decreased with the increasing number of breakthrough and clinical episodes. The converse was true for antibodies in the CQ and CQ + PROG groups. Group differences in the parasite densities would explain this. Parity and placental malaria did not influence titres significantly. Overall, antibodies of the CQ + PROG group decrease significantly with time, possibly due to its long period of aparasitaemia. This suggested interference with the immune responsiveness of the women. PROG, which was equally efficacious, offers better prophylaxis."

CD008122,0,9803816,0,Perinatal infections--problems in developing countries.,"The transmission of infections from the biologic mother to her offspring is popularly known as perinatal infection (PI). It is not synonymous to infections during the perinatal or neonatal period. Physicians should avoid focusing attention only on the TORCH agents in the evaluation of suspected PI. Perinatal period begins from 28 weeks of gestation. Would one consider in utero infections in the first or second trimester of pregnancy as PIs? Developing countries have difficulty in collecting reliable and accurate data of PIs. These data are useful to define the magnitude of the problems, to monitor the trends, to recognise the mode of spread, and to find a solution of PIs. Most PIs are asymptomatic and diagnosis is extremely difficult. Developing countries need rapid, easy-to-operate, simple, and cheap diagnostic tools urgently. Access to health care in the remote city is limited. Newer drugs are too expensive and very few patients can benefit from these. Each developing country should prioritize its PI problems and tackle those that have serious public health problems and socio-economic impact. Most developing countries should focus on HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and HBV (hepatitis B virus) infections. Other countries where ophthalmia, malaria or tuberculosis are prevalent or endemic, should focus on these. Developing countries are more willing to allocate the budget for prevention of diseases than for treatment. There may be problem of promulgating the information on prevention of diseases because of illiteracy, multi-lingual community. Vaccines where available, should be affordable. Other effective prevention guidelines should be workable in poorer nations. The government should play an important role in enforcing immunisation program by intensive promotion program or by legislation."

Other species sampled were An. (Nys.) braziliensis, An. (Ano.) peryassui, An. (Nys.) nuneztovari, An. (Nys.) oswaldoi s.l., and An. (Nys.) triannulatus. As determined by the ELISA technique An. darlingi had a higher overall infection rate (2.1%) compared with An. albitarsis E (1.2%). However a marginally higher proportion of An. albitarsis E was infected with Plasmodium vivax compared with An. darlingi, and the An. albitarsis E biting index was also much higher These results suggest the importance of An. albitarsis E in malaria transmission in a savannah ecoregion of northern Amazonian Brazil, and reconfirm the importance of An. darlingi even if at lower abundance."

The dipstick was compared to thick film microscopy; the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyze discordant results. The dipstick had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 95% compared with microscopy in the diagnosis of Plasmodium infections in a hospital population; the mean parasite density was approximately 590/mm3. In a field sample of mostly asymptomatic volunteers, the sensitivity of the dipstick for Plasmodium infection varied with parasite density. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of the dipstick was similar to thick film microscopy in the diagnosis of vivax malaria compared with the PCR. The dipstick was unable to detect P. vivax in the presence of P. falciparum because of cross-reactivity in the pan-specific band. Accurate species identification in mixed infections remains a problem in malaria diagnosis."

CD008122,0,11060067,0,Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 gag indeterminate western blot patterns in Central Africa: relationship to Plasmodium falciparum infection.,"To gain insight on the significance of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) indeterminate serological reactivities, we studied villagers of South Cameroon, focusing on a frequent and specific HTLV-1 Gag indeterminate profile (HGIP) pattern (gag p19, p26, p28, and p30 without p24 or Env gp21 and gp46). Among the 102 sera studied, 29 from all age groups had a stable HGIP pattern over a period of 4 years. There was no epidemiological evidence for sexual or vertical transmission of HGIP. Seventy-five percent of HGIP sera reacted positively on MT2 HTLV-1-infected cells by immunofluorescence assay. However, we could not isolate any HTLV-1 virus or detect the presence of p19 Gag protein in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from individuals with strong HGIP reactivity. PCR experiments conducted with primers for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 (HTLV-1/2 primers) encompassing different regions of the virus did not yield HTLV-1/2 proviral sequences from individuals with HGIP. Using 11 peptides corresponding to HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 immunodominant B epitopes in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, one epitope corresponding to the Gag p19 carboxyl terminus was identified in 75% of HGIP sera, while it was recognized by only 41% of confirmed HTLV-1-positive sera. A positive correlation between HTLV-1 optical density values and titers of antibody to Plasmodium falciparum was also demonstrated. Finally, passage of sera through a P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte-coupled column was shown to specifically abrogate HGIP reactivity but not the HTLV-1 pattern, suggesting the existence of cross-reactivity between HTLV-1 Gag proteins and malaria-derived antigens. These data suggest that in Central Africa, this frequent and specific Western blot is not caused by HTLV-1 infection but could instead be associated with P. falciparum infection."

Antigenic variation of PfEMP1 plays a key role in malaria pathogenesis, a process partially controlled at the level of var gene transcription. Transcriptional levels, throughout the intra-erythrocytic cycle, of 59 var genes of the NF54 clone were measured simultaneously by quantitative real-time PCR. The timing of var transcript abundance, the number of genes transcribed and whether transcripts were correctly spliced for protein expression were determined. Two parasite populations were studied; an unselected population of NF54 and a selected population, NF54VAR2CSA, to compare both the transcription of var2csa and the expression pattern of the corresponding protein."
CD008122,0,12848724,0,Current strategies to avoid misdiagnosis of malaria.,"Malaria remains the most important parasitic disease, and tens of thousands of cases are imported into non-endemic countries annually. However, any single institution may see only a very few cases-this is probably the reason why laboratory and clinical misdiagnosis may not be uncommon. In the laboratory, unfamiliarity with microscopic diagnosis may be the main reason, considering the large number of laboratory staff who provide on-call services, often without expert help at hand, as well as the difficulty in detecting cases with low-level parasitemia. Staff should therefore be provided with continuing microscopic training to maintain proficiency. The complementary use of immunochromatographic rapid detection tests (RDTs) may be useful, especially during on-call hours, although, in order to ensure correct interpretation, their inherent limitations have to be well known. Diagnosis based on the polymerase chain reaction is still unsuitable for routine use, due to its long turnaround time, its cost, and its unavailability outside regular hours, although it may be helpful in selected cases. Once the alert clinician has considered the possibility of malaria, and suspicion continues to be high, malaria can be excluded by repeat smears or RDTs. However, the absence of clinical suspicion may not be infrequent, and may have more serious consequences. Depending on the local number of malaria cases seen, laboratory staff should have a low threshold for the decision to perform unsolicited malaria diagnostic tests on suspicious samples, especially if other laboratory tests are abnormal (e.g. thrombocytopenia, presence of atypical lymphocytes, or raised lactate dehydrogenase). The detection of intraleukocytic hemozoin during automated full blood counts is a promising new way to avoid misdiagnosis of clinically unsuspected malaria."
CD008122,0,16751971,0,The Acre Project: the epidemiology of malaria and arthropod-borne virus infections in a rural Amazonian population.,"The authors describe the baseline malaria prevalence and arbovirus seroprevalence among 467 subjects in an ongoing cohort study in rural Amazonia. Most subjects (72.2%) reported one or more previous episodes of malaria, and 15.6% had been hospitalized for malaria, but only 3.6% of individuals five years or older had malaria parasites detected by microscopy (10 with Plasmodium vivax and 4 with P. falciparum). Antibodies to Alphavirus, Orthobunyavirus, and/or Flavivirus were detected by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) in 42.6% of subjects aged five years or older, with a higher seropositivity rate among males (49.2%) than females (36.2%). Since 98.9% of subjects had been immunized for yellow fever, the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to dengue and other Flaviviruses cannot be ruled out, but at least 12 subjects (3.3%) with IgM antibodies to dengue virus detected by ELISA had a putative recent exposure to this virus."
CD008122,0,17003770,0,Ensuring quality and access for malaria diagnosis: how can it be achieved?,"The replacement of conventional antimalarial drugs with high-cost, artemisinin-based alternatives has created a gap in the successful management of malaria. This gap reflects an increased need for accurate disease diagnosis that cannot be met by traditional microscopy techniques. The recent introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has the potential to meet this need, but successful RDT implementation has been curtailed by poor product performance, inadequate methods to determine the quality of products and a lack of emphasis and capacity to deal with these issues. Economics and a desire for improved case management will result in the rapid growth of RDT use in the coming years. However, for their potential to be realized, it is crucial that high-quality RDT products that perform reliably and accurately under field conditions are made available. In achieving this goal, the shift from symptom-based diagnosis to parasite-based management of malaria can bring significant improvements to tropical fever management, rather than represent a further burden on poor, malaria-endemic populations and their overstretched health services."
CD008122,0,3044153,0,Natural antibodies against three distinct and defined antigens of Plasmodium falciparum in residents of a mesoendemic area in Gabon.,"The magnitude of the antibody response to three distinct and defined antigens of Plasmodium falciparum was assessed in 144 inhabitants of the Kassa district (Haut Ogooué Province, Gabon), a region where malaria is mesoendemic. Antibodies against a polypeptide consisting of 40 (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro) repeats of P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein [(NANP)40] were detected by ELISA. Antibodies against the fusion peptide 31.1, which consists of the N-terminal portion of the 190-200 kDa glycoprotein, were also detected by ELISA. Antibodies against ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens (RESA), mainly the P. falciparum 155 kDa antigen (Pf 155), were detected by IFA on glutaraldehyde-fixed P. falciparum infected red blood cells (IRBC). In addition, a standard IFA employing air-dried P. falciparum IRBC was used to detect antibodies against intraerythrocytic asexual forms. Parasitemia and spleen enlargement were also recorded. The frequency of sera positive for specific antibodies increased with age for all the antigens tested. Plateau antibody levels were reached at different ages for the different antigens. Individual antibody responses varied in titer to the different antigens. Subjects with parasite-negative thick smears showed higher titers of anti-31.1 as well as an increased frequency of anti-RESA antibodies compared to subjects having positive smears. No differences in the titer and in the prevalence of anti-(NANP)40 antibodies were found between these groups. The results suggest that the antibody response against asexual blood stage antigens, especially anti-RESA and anti-31.1, may play a role in controlling parasitemia."

Analysis of three members of the Anopheles punctulatus complex, 68,458 An. farauti, 36,779 An. koliensis, and 11,667 An. punctulatus caught in landing catches was made using monoclonal antibody based ELISAs to detect sporozoites of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Sporozoite rates ranged from 0%-5.5% in An. farauti, 0.2%-3.8% in An. koliensis, and 0%-3.3% in An. punctulatus. In addition, over 3,000 An. longirostris were analyzed and sporozoites were not detected in this species. No significant differences were observed between the three vector species in the densities of P. falciparum sporozoites (geometric mean 2,320). However, the geometric mean P. vivax sporozoite density was significantly higher in An. punctulatus (350) than in either An. koliensis (160) or An. farauti (150). An. koliensis was less susceptible to infections of P. falciparum or P. vivax than either An. farauti or An. punctulatus. Variations in average sporozoite and inoculation rates were found among different villages, despite their close geographic proximity. Sporozoite and inoculation rates varied greatly within a village over time, but malaria transmission was perennial with a higher transmission during the wet season by An. koliensis and An. punctulatus."

With donor support, national malaria control programmes are now procuring large quantities of RDTs. The scarcity of health facilities and trained personnel in many sub-Saharan African countries means that limiting RDT use to such facilities would exclude a significant proportion of febrile cases. RDT use by volunteer community health workers (CHWs) is one alternative, but most sub-Saharan African countries prohibit CHWs from handling blood, and little is known about CHW ability to use RDTs safely and effectively. This Zambia-based study was designed to determine: (i) whether Zambian CHWs could prepare and interpret RDTs accurately and safely using manufacturer's instructions alone; (ii) whether simple, mostly pictorial instructions (a ""job aid"") could raise performance to adequate levels; and (iii) whether a brief training programme would produce further improvement."

DNA was extracted with three different methods from parasite lysate by phenol-chloroform, or from whole blood and from blood collected onto dry filter paper, by chelex-100. The expected 727-bp PCR product was obtained in all samples extracted by chelex-100, while three samples prepared by phenol-chloroform failed to show any amplified product. The crucial point mutation within the dhfr gene leading to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil resistance is localised in an Alul recognition site. Thus, the 727-bp PCR product was submitted to endonuclease digestion. Fifty out of the 56 blood samples analysed yielded the two expected restriction fragments and an undigested 727-bp band. These 50 samples likely represent mixed infection as also confirmed the specific mutation PCR. The six undigested samples amplify a 339-bp fragment using a nested PCR-specific for pyrimethamine resistance mutation. Our results show that, the rapid DNA extraction from blood using chelex-100 and the PCR endonuclease assay can be efficiently used for accurate chemosensitivity analysis in the field."

For this study, we used a synthetic peptide, known for its safety and reproducibility and the murine model of BALB/c mice. The long peptide (PbCS 242-310) used corresponds to the C-terminal region of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) that is the major protein on the surface of Plasmodium sporozoites. Subcutaneous injections of PbCS 242-310 in combination with soluble adjuvant OM-174 induced long lasting peptide-specific antibody titres comparable to those obtained by immunization with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). The ex vivo evaluation of the CD8(+) T cell response by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay revealed that the injection of polypeptide with OM-174 adjuvant induced, compared to IFA, a similar and an eight-fold increased frequency of peptide-specific lymphocytes in the draining lymph-nodes and in the spleen, respectively. The CD8(+) T-cells are specific for the sequence PbCS 245-253, a well-known H-2K(d)-restricted CTL epitope, and are cytotoxic as shown in a chromium release assay. Immunization of BALB/c mice with this polypeptide in combination with adjuvant OM-174 conferred a protection after challenge with live Plasmodium berghei sporozoites.The strong antibody and CTL responses observed to a synthetic peptide in mice, the safety profile of the adjuvant and its extensive physico-chemical characterization suggest that OM-174 has a potential use in vaccine formulations for humans."

Mosquitoes were sampled indoors and outdoors, and rDNA PCR was successfully used to identify 340 specimens. Anopheles parensis (91.8%), A. funestus (6.8%), and Anopheles leesoni (1.5%) were the three sibling species identified. A. parensis was the dominant species at all study sites, while 22 of 23 A. funestus were collected in the non-irrigated study site. None of the 362 specimens tested was positive for Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The most common blood-meal sources (mixed blood meals included) for A. parensis were goat (54.0%), human (47.6%), and bovine (39.7%), while the few A. funestus s.s. samples had fed mostly on humans. The human blood index (HBI) for A. parensis (mixed blood meals included) in the non-irrigated agro-ecosystem was 0.93 and significantly higher than 0.33 in planned rice agro-ecosystem. The few samples of A. funestus s.s. and A. funestus s.l. also showed a trend of higher HBI in the non-irrigated agro-ecosystem. We conclude that agricultural practices have significant influence on distribution and blood feeding behavior of A. funestus complex. Although none of the species was implicated with malaria transmission, these results may partly explain why non-irrigated agro-ecosystems are associated with higher risk of malaria transmission by this species compared to irrigated agro-ecosystems."

Clinical diagnosis of cerebral malaria was done by WHO criteria. The tests were conventional routine malaria microscopy; prolonged microscopy; dipstick antigen capture assay (Para Sight TM-F test); pigments in peripheral leucocytes and routine microscopy repeated at 12 hours interval. First four tests were done at 0 hours of hospital admission and repeat routine microscopy was added at 12 hours interval. Diagnostic capability of the test was 64%, 65%, 69%, 27% and 63% respectively. None of the tests except pigments in peripheral leucocytes was superior at initial evaluation. Only the dipstick test added 5% more diagnostic possibility compared with routine microscopy as standard. Stratification of diagnostic capability in different ways improved diagnosis 15% and 11% in smear negative cases by dipstick and prolonged microscopy respectively. It was increased by 50% (5/10 patients) with dipstick test in the smear negative patients with history of anti-malarials prior to hospital admission."

Data was obtained for a total of 4990 subjects of various ages. Forty point five percent of families reported use of drug prophylaxis. Use of drug prophylaxis decreased with age (69.2 p. 100 up to 1 year versus 34.5 p. 100 after 15 years). The proportion of subjects using bednets was 7.5 p. 100. Some subjects reported use of ineffective or dangerous substances such as pyrimethamin alone (17.5 p. 100) or amodiaquin. The incidence of reported malarial attacks increased in function of the length of stay in the country (50 p. 100 after 15 years). The most effective method of drug prophylaxis appeared to be a chloroquin and proguanil combination which was used by 25.4 p. 100 of subjects. The incidence of malarial attacks in subjects using this combination was 20.8 p. 100 as compared to 43.2 p. 100 in subjects using no drug prophylaxis. Forty-seven percent of the study population reported use of other preventive measures but none correlated with a decrease in the number of malaria attacks. Information concerning preventive measures is readily available but sometimes contradictory. Information provided locally seems to be the most effective but not always the best adapted. To increase the awareness among expatriates, it will be necessary to provide more accurate information about effective preventive measures especially regarding bed nets and drugs.

Using the Gram-Charlier series and the Marquardt's nonlinear least square dissecting method and the systematic computerized program for the dissection of mixed samples of tertian malaria with different incubation periods over the past 7 years in Changde City, Hunan Province, and discussing the influence of the climatic factor and epidemic process, it has been inferred that there were two kinds of incubation period of tertian malaria in this city. The long incubation period cases and the short ones have formed seasonal excessive distributions during the late spring and during the summer and autumn, respectively. The parameters estimated from the model had an optimal goodness of fitting to practical distribution (P = 0.9967). According to the tests for initial data the model was demonstrated to be effective as there was no statistically significant difference between the theoretical and the actual values."

CD008122,0,11693884,0,Development and optimization of polymerase chain reaction-based malaria diagnostic methods and their comparison with quantitative buffy coat assay.,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays targeting the small-subunit rRNA were developed and evaluated, allowing for the simultaneous diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax DNA in human blood samples. The PCR methods and quantitative buffy coat (QBC) were compared in 402 patients. The heminested PCR method showed a sensitivity of 97.4%, which was superior to the sensitivity of the QBC method (91.7%, P < 0.05), to simple PCR (84.6%, P < 0.001), and to PCR with digoxigenin labeling (PCR-DIG) (88.5%, P < 0.001). The PCR-DIG and QBC analyses were more sensitive than simple PCR (P < 0.003 and P < 0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference between the sensitivities of the QBC assay and the PCR-DIG assay. The specificity for the 3 PCR-based methods was 100%, superior to the specificity calculated for the QBC assay (88.95%, P < 0.009). The frequency of a positive result in groups from endemic areas but without detectable parasitemia increased, in order, from simple PCR, QBC test, PCR-DIG, to heminested PCR. An association between a positive PCR result and a history of malaria was also found. Taken together, these data suggest that this technology could be further developed to screen people with oligoparasitemia and to monitor malaria treatment."

However, difficulty in maintaining the required technical skills, particularly in areas where malaria is not endemic, has prompted the development of rapid nonmicroscopic diagnostic assays based on the detection of malaria parasite antigen in whole blood. In this study, we evaluated the performance of one such device, the Makromed dipstick test, blindly compared to PCR and microscopy for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 200 febrile returned travelers. The Makromed assay detects the presence of P. falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein II with an antigen capture immunochromatographic strip format. Compared to PCR as the reference standard, the dipstick assay had a sensitivity of 97.0% and a specificity of 96.0%. The positive and negative predictive values were 81.2% and 99.5%, respectively. Rapid malaria diagnostic devices may provide a useful diagnostic adjunct in a clinical setting."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of pretravel advice among a homogenous group of students, who received similar written information on vaccination requirements and health advice. They were referred to the travel clinic (50%) or a general practitioner (50%) for vaccination, counselling and prescriptions. Eighty-four out of 110 students (76%) returned the questionnaire. Insect repellent was used by all and only 10 used the repellent for less than 75% of the time spent in malaria endemic areas. Malaria chemoprophylaxis was taken by all but one: chloroquine plus proquanil by 12 and mefloquine by 71. Reported compliance with the dosing regimen was optimal in 64 students, 9 missed one dose and 10 stopped too early. Side effects due to antimalarials were reported by 25 (30%). Diarrhoea during travel occurred in 43 students (51%). Loperamide was used by 34 students with diarrhoea (79%), but only 2 out of 27 students with moderate to severe diarrhoea used the recommended self-treatment with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. In conclusion, the recommendations of malaria prophylaxis were well implemented by most travellers despite a high incidence of self-reported side effects to antimalarials. The incidence of traveller's diarrhoea was high and the recommendation for early self-treatment of moderate to severe diarrhoea with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic in combination with loperamide was not put into practice."

Combination therapy may improve efficacy and delay the selection of resistant malaria parasites. Combinations of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) with 4-aminoquinolines offer affordable and available alternatives to CQ. We conducted a randomized, single-blinded trial to compare the efficacy of SP monotherapy with combinations of SP and either CQ or amodiaquine (AQ) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in patients over 6 months of age in Kampala, Uganda. Of the 448 patients enrolled, 428 (95%) completed follow-up. Clinical treatment failure after 14 days occurred in 21/140 (15.0%, 95% CI 9.5-22.0%) SP-treated, 11/152 (7.2%, 95% CI 3.7-12.6%) SP/CQ-treated, and 0/136 (0%, 95% CI 0-2.7%) SP/AQ-treated patients. Combination therapies were safe and offered superior efficacy to SP monotherapy. SP/AQ was the most efficacious. This low-cost combination regimen may provide an optimal alternative to CQ for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda."

Humoral immune responses.,"Humoral immune responses to malaria were studied in 100 patients with cerebral malaria of whom 53 had added complications, 108 patients with acute malaria, and 100 blood donors. The methods employed were indirect hemagglutination (IHA), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and parasite growth inhibition (PGI) tests. Patients with cerebral malaria, especially those with complications, had histories of fewer attacks of malaria in the previous 5 years than did those with acute malaria, suggesting that the cerebral malaria patients were less immune. The combined cerebral malaria group (complicated and uncomplicated) did not show defective humoral immune responses, since the initial seronegative rate and the mean initial IHA and IFA antibody titers were not significantly different from those of acute malaria patients and the mean initial ELISA titer was even higher than that of the acute malaria group. Reduced humoral responses were found only in complicated cerebral malaria patients, as their mean initial IHA titer was lower and their IHA seronegative rate was higher than those in acute malaria patients and in the uncomplicated cerebral malaria group. The combined cerebral malaria group had greater PGI activity than that of acute malaria patients, but this increased activity was entirely due to the higher results obtained in the complicated cerebral malaria group. The increased PGI activity returned to normal after recovery. An IgG preparation from seven of eight of these sera failed to exert the growth inhibition effect. Factors other than IgG were therefore responsible for the inhibition of parasite growth."

CD008122,0,15916076,1,Detection of P. vivax antigens in malaria endemic populations of Nepal by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies raised against Thai isolates.,"An indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibody (MAb) originated from the native Thai isolates of P. vivax (McPV1) and the polyclonal antibody (PAb) raised against Nepali isolates of P. vivax was developed for detection of P vivax antigens in red cell lysates. The assay was specific (100%) since it was positive only with P. vivax-infected erythrocytes and was negative when erythrocytes from 40 healthy individuals from malaria non-endemic areas and 40 P. falciparum infected erythrocytes were tested. When the assay was applied to 203 vivax blood samples already proven by microscopic examination collected from Dhanusha district of Nepal, and using the cut-off level of the mean optical density (OD) (0.144) of 40 healthy individuals who had been living in malaria-endemic areas (0.073) + 2 SD (0.016), the assay could detect 189/203 samples, indicating the sensitivity of the test was 93.1% with a detection limit of erythrocytes of 240 parasites/10(6) erythrocytes. In addition, the assay was negative when 40 blood samples with fever of unknown origin, collected from the same malaria-endemic areas, were tested. However, there was a significant correlation between OD values and parasitemia (r=0.649; p=0.018). The results indicate that MAb-PAb indirect ELISA using MAb raised against Thai isolates of P. vivax as the coating antibodies, and polyclonal antibodies raised against local Nepali isolates as the detecting antibody, could detect P. vivax antigens with high degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, it seems that the McPV1 MAb raised against Thai isolates of P. vivax could recognize the antigens of Nepali isolates in a wide range of blood samples."

The study covered six areas in two highly malaria-endemic areas of provinces located along the Thai-Myanmar border. The study was conducted between April and October 2000, by purposively recruiting 436 malaria suspected cases attending mobile malaria clinics. Each patient was randomly selected to receive service via the three diagnostic models; their accuracy was 95.17%, 94.48% and 89.04%, respectively. In addition, their true positive rates for all malaria species were 76.19%, 82.61% and 73.83%; for falciparum malaria 85.71%, 80.95% and 80.00%, and for vivax malaria 57.14%, 100% and 50%, respectively, with the parasitemia ranging from 80 to 58,240 microl of blood. Consequently, their costs were determined by dividing into provider and consumer costs, which were consequently classified into internal and external costs. The internal costs were the costs of the public providers, whereas the external costs were those incurred by the patients. The aggregate costs of these three models were 58,500.35, 36,685.91, and 40,714.01 Baht, respectively, or 339.53, 234.39, and 243.93, in terms of unit costs per actual case. In the case of microscopy, if all suspected malaria cases incurred forgone opportunity costs of waiting for treatment, the aggregate cost and unit cost per actual case were up to 188,110.89 and 944.03 Baht, respectively. Accordingly, the cost-effectiveness for all malaria species, using their true positive rates as the effectiveness indicator, was 446.75, 282.40, and 343.56 respectively, whereas for falciparum malaria it was 394.80, 289.37 and 304.91, and for vivax malaria 595.67, 234.39 and 487.86, respectively. This study revealed that the on-site OptiMAL was the most cost-effective. It could be used to supplement or even replace microscopy for this criteria in general. This study would be of benefit to malaria control program policy makers to consider using RDT technology to supplement microscopy in remote non-microscope areas."

We report, for the first time, the immunological characteristics of recombinant ABRA constructs. The recombinant proteins representing different fragments of ABRA were expressed in Escherichia coli, either as fusions with maltose binding protein or as 6X histidine tagged molecules, and purified by affinity chromatography. Immunogenicity studies with these constructs in rabbits and mice indicated that the N-terminal region is the least immunogenic part of ABRA. T-cell proliferation experiments in mice immunized with these constructs revealed that the T-cell epitopes were localized in the middle portion of the protein. More importantly, the purified immunoglobulin G specific to middle and C-terminal fragments prevented parasite growth at levels approaching 80-90%. We found that these proteins were also recognized by sera from P. falciparum-infected patients from Rourkela, a malaria endemic zone of India. Our immunogenicity results suggest that potential of ABRA as a vaccine candidate antigen should be investigated further."

At present, most of these soluble malarial proteins have been purified and have had their genes cloned; the primary sequence displays considerable polymorphism upon tandem repeats. However, its function and the relevance of the polymorphism for the induction of host immune response, predominantly IgM and T-cell-independent type, has yet to be determined. The potential of P. falciparum exoantigens as immunodiagnostic tools has been the focus of numerous studies. Enzyme immunoassays or radioimmunoassays for the detection of malarial antigens in blood of suspected peoples have been reported. Their development requires increasing both specificity and sensitivity. Recently, some P. falciparum exoantigens have been proposed as candidates for inclusion in an anti-disease vaccine which induces a clinical but not parasiticidal immunity against malaria. There is much interest in this concept and their efficiency remains to be confirmed, as new strategies are needed in the prevention of malaria."

We assessed antibody and T-cell reactivity to GRP78 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in lymphoproliferative assays. Serological evaluation of plasma samples obtained in Sudan revealed that 89% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL), 78% with post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), and 85% with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) had antibody reactivity to this Leishmania antigen. Plasma from healthy Sudanese individuals living in an area endemic for malaria but free of leishmaniasis and plasma from healthy Danes was negative in the assay. GRP78 antibody was detected in 10% and 5% of plasma samples from Sudanese and Ghanaian malaria patients, respectively, whereas 35% of plasma samples from otherwise healthy Sudanese individuals with a positive leishmanin skin test showed antibody reactivity to recombinant GRP78 (rGRP78). In lymphoproliferative assays, 9 of 13 isolates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from individuals previously infected with L. donovani and one of three individuals previously infected with L. major showed a response to rGRP78, whereas PBMC isolates from Danish control individuals did not respond.

Over a 4 months' sampling period 2222 anopheline mosquitoes were collected using light-traps and indoor resting catches, of which 58.6% were A. gambiae, 7.6% A. arabiensis, 6.9% A. merus and 26.9% A. funestus. Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite antigen (CSA) rates were: A. funestus 6.05% (n = 479), A. gambiae 8.4% (n = 1042), A. arabiensis 7.3% (n = 136) and A. merus 9.8% (n = 122). The P. malariae CSA rate for all anophelines was 0.07% (n = 1862). Estimated sporozoite densities were less than 2000 for at least 50% of all the positive mosquitoes. Along the coast the abundance of A. merus (41.3%) and A. gambiae (46.1%) was similar, and their CSA rates were comparable (11.6% and 12.5%, respectively) and higher than those for A. arabiensis (7.7%) and A. funestus (4.6%).

For the rapid test, OptiMAL commercial kits were used. The results were also evaluated with clinical findings from patients. The parasites were determined by microscopic examination of thick-blood films from 81 patients with vivax malaria from southeastern Anatolia, Turkey. The OptiMAL test results were found to be negative in five patients who were diagnosed clinically and through thick-film testing as having vivax malaria. There was no false positivity observed with the OptiMAL test. We concluded that this rapid malaria test has a lower level of sensitivity than the classical thick-blood-film test for malaria, but that these methods have equal specificity."

Multi-species infection was common, particularly in children less than 10 years of age. Circumsporozoite (CS) antibodies to P. vivax were detected by ELISA, using the recombinant protein NS181V20, in sera from 53-95% of all subjects in this study. The specificity of reactivity to NS181V20 was confirmed by immunofluorescence using air-dried sporozoites. CS antibodies to P. falciparum were present in less than 50% of the population less than 30 years of age. These data support further testing of this protein as a candidate vivax vaccine."

They belonged to several groups according to parasite (Plasmodium falciparum or vivax) and clinical manifestations (i.e. asymptomatic parasite carriers, acute uncomplicated attack or severe malaria episodes). aCL were measured in an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) performed in the presence of either goat serum (aCLs) or gelatin (aCLg). In a group of 53 patients with autoimmune manifestations (i.e. antiphospholipid syndrome and/or lupus), detection of IgG but not IgM aCL was markedly reduced in the presence of gelatin. In malaria donors, high prevalence of serum co-factor-independent IgG and IgM were detected, and the presence of goat serum in the assay consistently decreased their detection. aCLg levels were found to be related to the clinical/endemic status of donors. IgG aCLg were found to be higher in asymptomatic P. falciparum carriers than in patients with uncomplicated acute or cerebral malaria. IgM aCLg were higher in the cerebral malaria group than in groups with uncomplicated acute malaria patients or asymptomatic individuals. Data suggest that using a serum co-factor independent, sensitive ELISA, aCL are commonly detected during malarial infections and related to malarial infection status."
CD008122,0,1819395,0,[Malaria of the pregnant woman and the newborn].,"A 25 year-old primigravid woman developed chronic falciparum malaria at 23 weeks' gestation. Diagnosis was suspected on splenomegaly and haemolytic anaemia but without fever and confirmed by thin smears (Plasmodium falciparum) and serologic tests. She was successfully cured with chloroquine therapy. One week after her return from Cameroon, a 28 year-old woman was seen for malaria at 32 weeks' gestation. In spite of chloroquine therapy, foetal troubles appeared and a caesarean was performed. The newborn had an APGAR coefficient of 3 points and examination both of his blood films and the placenta revealed numerous trophozoites of P. falciparum. Chloroquine resulted in a rapid cure of the child. In endemic areas, parasitaemia is more frequent and dense during pregnancy, and especially in primigravidae. However, clinical symptoms remain rare because of acquired immunity. In case of no or loss of immunity, malarial infections are heavy and abortions are frequent. Congenital malaria is probably due to transplacental transfer of infected red blood cells of the mother. In endemic areas, the incidence is low due to the simultaneously transferred immunity. Emergency treatment is necessary because of life-threatening to both mother and child."

Single peptide antigens were generally less sensitive than parasite extracts; however, peptides G3 and G7 were more sensitive than parasite extracts in detecting first attacks of P. vivax. Examination of isotype specific responses demonstrated that this may be explained by higher IgG responses to these peptides in first than in subsequent P. vivax attacks. Because of the differing antibody specificities in primary and secondary P. falciparum and P. vivax cases, the best sensitivity was achieved by using the combined results of assays with three antigens: P. chabaudi, peptide G3 and peptide G7. The combined sensitivity was 77.1% for P. falciparum and 88.6% for P. vivax acute cases with 91.1% specificity."
CD008122,0,1298084,0,Two-site sandwich ELISA for detection of Plasmodium vivax blood stage antigens using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.,"Two systems of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a two-site monoclonal antibody sandwich ELISA MAb-MAb sandwich ELISA) and a two site polyclonal-monoclonal antibody sandwich ELISA (PAb-MAb sandwich ELISA) for the detection of Plasmodium vivax antigens were developed. The assays showed good correlation with the level of parasitemia when tested against serially diluted P. vivax parasites (r = 0.937, and 0.997 for MAb-MAb and PAb-MAb sandwich ELISA, respectively), with the ability to detect as few as 6.68 parasites/10(6) erythrocytes and 2.69 parasites/10(3) erythrocytes, respectively. The MAb-MAb sandwich ELISA was specific, since it was positive only with P. vivax-infected erythrocytes from vivax malaria patients and negative when erythrocytes from 34 healthy individuals and 30 falciparum malaria cases were tested. In contrast, cross-reaction was found in the PAb-MAb sandwich ELISA when the plates were coated with polyclonal IgG and tested against the serially diluted P. falciparum SO strain antigen prepared from in vitro cultures. Comparison between the two systems of two-site sandwich ELISA showed that the MAb-MAb sandwich ELISA was superior to the PAb-MAb sandwich ELISA: (1) it gave a higher sensitivity when tested with serially diluted P. vivax antigen preparations from vivax malaria patients; (2) it gave a higher specificity when tested with the SO strain of P. falciparum from in vitro cultures, (3) it gave a lower absorbance value when tested with erythrocytes from healthy individuals. All 281 cases of vivax malaria already proven by microscopic examination were positive by MAb-MAb sandwich ELISA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

ICT was applied in 674 febrile returnees from malaria-endemic regions attending our Tropical Diseases Unit. Microscopy confirmed malaria in 69/674 cases, of whom 67/69 had returned from Africa or Madagascar, and 2/69 from the Caribbean. Monoparasitic P.f. infection occurred in 52/69, mixed infection was due to P.f.+ P. ovale (P.o.) in 3/69, and P.f.+P. malariae (P.m.) in 1/69 cases. Monoparasitic P. vivax (P.v.) infection occurred in 8/69 , P.o. in 3/69, and P.m. in 2/69 cases . Whereas a positive HRP-2 band on the test was a highly sensitive indicator for P.f. infection (52/52 patients; sensitivity 100%), this was not the case for a positive aldolase band (25/52 patients; sensitivity 48.1%). Sensitivity of aldolase band for non-falciparum plasmodia was even lower: aldolase was positive in only 3/8 (37.5%) of patients with vivax malaria, and in 0/5 cases with P.o.- or P.m. infection. Co-reaction of both bands occurred more frequently in patients with P.f. parasitaemia of > or =40,000/microl (20/25, 80.0%) as compared to patients with P.f. parasitaemia <40,000/microl (5/27, 18.5%; P<0.00005), and to patients with mixed infection (P.f.+ P.o., P.f.+ P.m.: 2/4, 50.0%; diff. n.s.). In our series, co-reaction of HRP-2 and aldolase indicated monoparasitic falciparum malaria with high P.f. parasitaemia, rather than mixed infection. Whereas the aldolase band is not a reliable qualitative marker for malaria, co-reaction of HRP-2 and aldolase band may have a potential for indicating high parasitaemia in falciparum malaria."

The sensitivity of this assay was 5, 10 and 10 parasites per 10(6) erythrocytes for cultured P. falciparum, patient-derived P. vivax and P. falciparum, respectively. The coincidence rates for this assay were 93% (92/99) with healthy individuals and 93% (42/45) with microscopically confirmed vivax malaria cases.

The mean +/- SD optical density (OD) values for the normal control group using PF-108 and PC-1E12 were 0.351 +/- 0.036 and 0.205 +/- 0.044, respectively. Mean OD values for the three infected groups were found to be significantly higher than those of the normal control group for both MAbs. However, ELISA values for individual serum specimens did not correlate with the level of parasitemia in the infected blood. Using a cut-off point of mean OD +/- 3 SD of the normal control group as indicating a positive reading, the specificity of this assay with both MAbs was 100%. The sensitivity of the assay using PF-1G8 was 95% while that obtained with PC-1E12 was 98%."
CD008122,0,9509627,1,"Comparative performance of the ParaSight F test for detection of Plasmodium falciparum in malaria-immune and nonimmune populations in Irian Jaya, Indonesia.","A comparison was made of the performance of the ParaSight F test (F test) for detection of Plasmodium falciparum in blood from malaria-immune (410 native Irianese) and nonimmune (369 new transmigrants) populations in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, where malaria is hyperendemic and all four species of human malaria occur. There were highly significant differences between populations in the sensitivity (Irianese, 60% versus transmigrants, 84%; P < 0.001) and specificity (Irianese, 97% versus transmigrants, 84%; P < 0.001) of the F test. The test had comparably high levels of sensitivity for Irianese children aged < or = 10 years, both age groups of transmigrants (76-85%), but low sensitivity for Irianese aged > 10 years (40%), among whom only 7% of parasitaemias < 120 per microliter and 69% of those > 120 per microliter were detected. Specificity was comparably high for transmigrant children aged < or = 10 years and both age groups of Irianese (93-98%). The low specificity for transmigrants aged > 10 years (79%) was due to a preponderance of false positives, frequently identified by microscopy as P. vivax. The results suggest that comparison based on microscopy underestimated the performance of the ParaSight F test and that malaria immune status, irrespective of P. falciparum density, may influence the test's sensitivity."
CD008122,0,8516626,0,Detection of antibodies to a 70 kDa Plasmodium falciparum exoantigen in malarious subjects using synthetic peptides.,"Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum in patients with acute malaria from Bolivar State, Venezuela. Antibody titers increased significantly with repeated malarial episodes. IgG antibody responses to 4 synthetic peptides (termed C2, C3, C5, C10) derived from a 70 kDa P. falciparum (Indochina I/CDC strain) exoantigen were evaluated by a peptide-ELISA with overall positivity rates of 20%, 40%, 20% and 58%, respectively. Seropositivity to peptide C10 was consistently over 50% (range 53-75%) among patients of different ages. Overall IgM reactivity to the respective peptides was 53%, 30%, 83% and 70%. IgM reactivity was generally greater in patients with primary malarial infections. The ELISA is a useful adjunct to the IFA in measuring naturally-occurring antibodies to specific parasite proteins."
CD008122,0,1524148,0,"Heightened transmission of stable malaria in an isolated population in the highlands of Irian Jaya, Indonesia.","Malaria at an elevation of 1,500 meters is uncommon and is usually unstable when it occurs. To confirm reports of a recent increase in transmission of stable malaria in the Oksibil Valley, which is at an elevation of 1,250-1,500 meters in the Jayawijaya Mountains of Irian Jaya, Indonesia, five malariometric surveys were conducted in four villages between May 1990 and July 1991. A total of 3,380 blood smears, representative of 1,949 persons, was examined. Prevalence rates over the survey period were consistent in each of the four villages, averaging 10% for infants, 50% for children 1-4 years of age, 35% for those 5-9 years old, 28% for those 10-14 years old, and 16% for adults (greater than 15 years old). The spleen rate for the those less than five years old was 96%, with an average enlarged spleen score of 2.32. Plasmodium falciparum accounted for 55% of the infections in the valley, but P. vivax was the predominant species in those less than 10 years old. In the village of Kutdol at an elevation of 1,500 meters, P. malariae was identified in 43% of the positive smears. Four cases were diagnosed as P. ovale. Infection with P. falciparum without obvious clinical symptoms was common in both adults and children. Entomologic and epidemiologic data suggested that the recent upsurge in transmission coincided with the replacement of traditional village huts with the more modern social housing. This replacement required the extensive construction of drainage ditches, which inadvertently also served as additional vector breeding sites. We suspect that this manipulation of the environment, in an effort to improve the quality of life, created conditions conductive for heightened transmission of stable malaria."
CD008122,0,3554543,0,Cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey of malaria in endemic areas with different activities of malaria control.,"A single cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey of malaria antibody was conducted in 1982 in Klang District, Rayong Province in three villages under different phases of malaria control activity to determine whether a single survey could be used to delineate malaria endemicity in Thailand and to compare the usefulness of ELISA and the indirect haemagglutination test (IHA) in the assessment of malaria endemicity. Village 11 was a control area with high infection rate with an annual slide positive rate of 16.3% in 1981. Village 6 was also a control area but was in the late attack phase in which residual insecticide spraying has been ceased since 1976. Village 7 was a consolidation area. Finger-tipped blood was collected from 189, 191 and 132 individuals from villages 11, 6 and 7 respectively, and the plasma tested for anti-P. falciparum antibody with ELISA and IHA.

After age stratification, it was shown that the differences were observed in every age group except in the greater than or equal to 45 year age group of village 6. With IHA, a significantly higher seropositive rates in population of village 11 was evident when they were compared with the corresponding age groups of 6-14, 15-29 and 30-44 years in village 7, and the age group of less than or equal to 5 year in village 6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

More than 20% of the 56 millions of deaths in 2001 were of children less than 5 years old. There are at least 1 million deaths per year from malaria. Diarrhoea kill more than 1.5 million, and measles more than half a million. The large majority of deaths by infectious diseases occur in underdeveloped countries. Moreover, chronic diseases kill an increasing number in underdeveloped countries, because populations are aging, because expansive health care which is needed to prevent and control these diseases is unavailable, and because the inhabitants are increasingly exposed to risk factors. In particular, smoking is increasing dramatically in underdeveloped countries as a result of the aggressive marketing of tobacco companies, the delay in implementing antismoking regulations, and because the public perception of the risk of smoking is still low. More than 4 million deaths per year are presently attributed to smoking, and reports forecast a death toll of 10 million in 2030. The WHO, Harvard University and the World Bank are at the origin of comprehensive data analyses on the ""global burden of diseases"" which help to identify health priorities. Unfortunately, global data are still scarce and of low quality, particularly in those underdeveloped countries where they would be most useful. Precise knowledge of the variations of mortality, morbidity and exposure to risk factors would be essential to monitor the improvements, or failures of health care progress. The optimal interpretation of the available data requires expertise in demography, epidemiology, statistics, and computer sciences, which are rarely found in this area. Thus, improvements in the collection of data and in the research effort in this field are necessary."
CD008122,0,18831954,0,Relationship between immunoglobulin isotype response to Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigens and parasitological indexes as well as splenomegaly in sympatric ethnic groups living in Mali.,"This study aimed to assess correlations between anti-malarial antibody levels and differences in malariometric characteristics, seen between two sympatric ethnic groups, the Fulani and the Dogon, living in Mali. Plasma levels of anti-malarial IgE, IgG, IgG1-4 and total IgE were determined in asymptomatic individuals, of the above mentioned groups, and were correlated to malariometric indexes. Significantly higher levels of anti-malarial IgE, IgG, IgG1-3 and total IgE were detected in the Fulani individuals as compared to the Dogon. No difference in plasma levels of malaria specific IgG4 was noted between the two groups. Within the Fulani, an increase in total IgE levels was associated with the presence of infection. As the IgG4 level increased, the number of clones decreased in the Fulani individuals. A positive correlation between elevated levels of anti-malarial IgG and IgG3 and splenomegaly was noted only within the Fulani group. No other correlations between antibody levels and parasite prevalence, clone numbers or spleen rates were observed in any of the communities. These results suggest that the magnitude of antibody response against Plasmodium falciparum may not be as important as it is believed to be. Instead, the fine specificity or function of the response might be more critical in protection against malaria disease."

Ten within normal subjects were taken as controls. Complete blood picture, repeated stool examination, rectal snip by transparency technique, ELISA for specific IgM antibodies for S. mansoni, indirect haemagglutination test for S. mansoni, Fasciola, hydatid, amoebic liver abscess and toxoplasmosis, indirect fluorescent antibody test for toxoplasmosis and abdominal ultrasonography were performed whenever indicated. Cases comprised 8 (26%) acute S. mansoni, 7 (24%) acute fascioliasis, 3 (10%) hydatid cyst, 8 (26%) amoebic liver abscess, 2 (7%) toxoplasmoisis and 2 (7%) malaria cases. The clinical picture of acute S. mansoni and acute fascioliasis were similar in the form of prolonged fever, diarrhea, hepatomegaly and leucocytosis with high eosinophilia. Serology (ELISA and IHAT) was essential in differentiating them. Abdominal ultrasonography is an easy, sensitive, cheap, non-invasive technique aiding in the diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess, liver hydatid cysts and fascioliasis but again serology was essential in differenting them. Toxoplasmic lymphadenitis mimic the clinical picture of infectious mononucleosis. Serology (monospot test, IHAT, IFAT) clinched the diagnosis. Malaria cases presented atypically by gastrointestinal manifestations and hepatic affection. Diagnosis was by positive blood smears."

CD008122,0,9334855,0,Soluble haemoglobin is a marker of recent Plasmodium falciparum infections.,"Monoclonal antibodies (Mab) were raised against haemoglobin (Hb) associated with Plasmodium falciparum protein and used to develop an ELISA, measuring circulating levels of released Hb. This assay was evaluated in different malaria patients in parallel with ELISA assays for C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin. Levels of Hb were negatively associated with levels of haptoglobin. Increased levels of serum Hb and CRP and decreased levels of haptoglobin were seen in Danish malaria patients. Consecutive studies showed that increased Hb levels were detectable 3-7 days after initiation of treatment probably because of drug induced destruction of infected erythrocytes. Increased levels of CRP were measured 0-3 days after initiation of treatment. The Hb assay was used in an epidemiological study of malaria in an area of Sudan with unstable malaria transmission. The proportion of Sudanese adults with detectable soluble Hb was higher in the rainy season with malaria transmission compared to the dry season. Hb levels in the rainy season were negatively associated with levels of haptoglobin. Most adults had increased levels of soluble Hb and decreased levels of haptoglobin 7 and 30 days after their treatment of P. falciparum malaria compared to the levels during acute disease. Thus, both soluble Hb and haptoglobin appear to be markers of recent P. falciparum infections. Very high levels of CRP protein were measured in some of the malaria patients at the day of treatment while lower levels were recorded 7 and 30 days after treatment. Soluble Hb levels were associated with malariometric parameters in a similar fashion to haptoglobin. The new Mab-based assay for measuring soluble Hb in the peripheral blood of malaria patients may be useful for future epidemiological studies of malaria."

Berberine, a plant alkaloid, has been used for fluorescent staining of the Y chromosome. We evaluated whether berberine can be used for staining of malarial parasites in 40 selected peripheral blood smears from patients with clinical symptoms of malaria; smears were evaluated with OptiMal (DiaMed, Miami, FL) and Giemsa stain. Twenty were positive with both OptiMal and Giemsa (Plasmodium vivax, 14; Plasmodium falciparum, 6); 10 were negative with both. The remainder were positive by OptiMal but negative by Giemsa and, therefore, were classified as equivocal. All slides were processed simultaneously, stained with berberine, and read under a fluorescent microscope. P vivax and P falciparum DNA fluoresced with berberine. The positives and negatives by berberine concurred with the Giemsa staining. Of the 10 equivocal smears, 5 were confirmed positive by berberine. Gametocytes were easily identifiable. This test has high sensitivity and high positive predictive value and, once standardized, can be used as a potential screening and diagnostic tool."

CD008122,0,7596635,0,Cytoadherence-related homologous motifs in Plasmodium falciparum antigen Pf155/RESA and erythrocyte band 3 protein.,"Cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. The identity of cell surface molecules on parasitized erythrocytes involved in cytoadherence is of great interest to understand the molecular basis of this mechanism. Peptide sequences derived from exofacial loops of the erythrocyte antigen band 3 from parasitized erythrocytes have previously been shown to inhibit cytoadherence. We now report that a non-repeated region of Pf155/RESA (residues 213-218) contains a hexapeptide motif being highly homologous to cytoadherence inhibitory sequences from band 3. Synthetic peptides containing the hexapeptide motif of Pf155/RESA inhibited the binding of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes to melanoma cells in vitro. Furthermore, individuals residing in malaria-endemic areas have antibodies reactive with epitopes involving these motifs in band 3 and in Pf155/RESA."
CD008122,0,8878599,0,Chemical Determinants of antimalarial activity of reversed siderophores.,"Reversed siderophores (RSFs) are artificial hydroxamate-based iron chelators designed after the natural siderophore ferrichrome. The modular molecular design of RSF derivatives allowed the synthesis of various congeners with controlled iron-binding capacities and partition coefficients. These two physicochemical properties were assessed by a novel fluorescent method and were found to be the major determinants of RSF permeation across erythrocyte membranes and scavenging of compartmentalized iron. The partition coefficient apparently conferred upon RSFs two major features: (i) the ability to rapidly access iron pools of in vitro-grown Plasmodium falciparum at all developmental stages and to mobilize intracellular iron and transfer it to the medium and (ii) the ability to suppress parasite growth at all developmental stages. These features of RSFs were assessed by quantitative determination of the structure-activity relationships of the biological activities and partition coefficients spanning a wide range of values. The most effective RSF containing the aromatic group of phenylalanine (RSFm2phe) showed 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.60 +/- 0.03 nmol/ml in a 48-h test and a 2-h onset of inhibition of ring development at 5 nmol/ml. The lipophilic compound RSFm2phe and the lipophilic and esterase-cleavable compound RSFm2pee inhibited parasite growth at all developmental stages whether inhibition was assessed in a continuous mode or after discontinuing drug administration. The antimalarial effects of RSFm2phe and cleavable RSFm2pee were potentiated in the presence of desferrioxamine (DFO) at concentrations at which DFO alone had no effect on parasite growth. These studies provide experimental evidence indicating that the effective and persistent antimalarial actions of RSFs are associated with drug access to infected cells and scavenging of iron from intracellular parasites. Moreover, the optimal antimalarial actions of RSFs are apparently also determined by improved accessibility to critical iron pools or by specific interactions with critical parasite targets."
CD008122,0,2470378,0,Drug-protein conjugates--XVIII. Detection of antibodies towards the antimalarial amodiaquine and its quinone imine metabolite in man and the rat.,"A specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection and characterisation of antibodies directed against amodiaquine (AQ), an anti-malarial drug associated with agranulocytosis and liver damage in man. The assay incorporated an antigen which was produced by the reaction of amodiaquine quinone imine (AQQI), a protein reactive product produced from AQ by silver oxide oxidation, and metallothionein. The protein-conjugate (AQ-MT) had a ratio of AQ to protein of 5.2:1. Specific anti-drug antibody was defined as the differential binding to AQ-MT and unconjugated MT which was inhibitable by AQ-mercapturate (5 microM). Following administration of AQ (0.27 mmol/kg; for 4 days) to male Wistar rats there was a significant increase in the IgG anti-AQ activity on day 18 (P less than 0.05, 0.596 +/- 0.410, N = 7) compared to pre-injection levels (0.111 +/- 0.074, N = 7). This activity was shown to be specific for the AQ determinant by hapten inhibition with AQ (IC50 250 nM) and AQ-mercapturate (IC50 310 nM). Following administration of AQQI (27 mumol/kg; i.m.; 4 days) there was a significant increase in IgG anti-AQ antibody activities on day 18 (0.584 +/- 0.161, N = 7) compared to pre-injection levels (0.078 +/- 0.048, N = 7). This activity was inhibited by AQ (IC50 150 nM) and AQ-mercapturate (IC50 180 nM). In addition IgG anti-AQ antibodies were detected in four patients who exhibited agranulocytosis and one patient who exhibited hepatitis (range 0.017-0.842) whilst receiving AQ at a dose of 400 mg weekly for several weeks, but not in individuals who had not received the drug (-0.014 +/- 0.022, N = 7). There was no increase in IgG anti-AQ antibody activities in patients who had not exhibited an adverse reaction whilst receiving the drug for the treatment of malaria (-0.059 +/- 0.074 on day 0 and -0.053 +/- 0.068 on day 7, N = 13). Thus, we have shown that AQ is immunogenic in the rat and that the formation of a chemically reactive metabolite (AQQI) is involved in the generation of the antibody response. Furthermore, drug-specific antibodies were detected in sera from five patients with severe adverse reactions to the drug."

Almost all previous analyses of antibody mediated inhibition of parasite growth in vitro were performed with different laboratory strains of P. falciparum. This study was performed to investigate if the long-term culturing of parasites has any effect on their susceptibility to such growth inhibition. The growth inhibitory effects of human antibodies to the vaccine candidate antigens Pf155/RESA and Pf332 on fresh field isolates from children in Burkina Faso were analysed and compared with their effect on an established laboratory strain of the parasite. Although there was variation in the inhibition titres between different isolates tested against one antibody preparation, the differences in inhibition capacity for the three different antibodies were highly significant. No correlation was found between serum levels of anti-Pf155/RESA or -Pf332 antibodies and sensitivity of the corresponding parasite isolates to antibody mediated growth inhibition."

ELISA blood levels, following standard treatment with chloroquine of pregnant and non-pregnant women, showed mean values comparable to other analytical methods. Blood chloroquine concentrations were estimated at day 0, 350-400 ng/ml; day 2, 1000-1500 ng/ml; day 14, 350-400 ng/ml; day 28, 180-350 ng/ml. In a separate sample a significant association was observed between history of chloroquine use in the previous 2 weeks and blood ELISA values (P less than 0.01). Mean ELISA values in breast-milk were higher than in corresponding whole blood samples. High concentrations of chloroquine in urine were observed. There was a weak association of the ELISA of urine and blood samples collected at the same time (P = 0.076). This study confirms the low sensitivity (less than 55%) of the Dill-Glazko test in urine, which is 100-1000 times less sensitive than the ELISA; the latter can detect 10-20 ng chloroquine per ml. A cut-off value for blood positivity 2 weeks following therapeutic drug ingestion was determined (40% ELISA inhibition), which can be used to make decisions about subject selection in drug sensitivity tests or population surveys. There are several advantages with the ELISA under field conditions. These include direct measurement of whole blood concentration; avoidance of problems of urine collection; suitability of finger-prick samples, especially with young children; application to population surveys to monitor drug use; and selection of subjects for drug sensitivity tests and monitoring of blood levels during in vivo tests."

CD008122,0,8846490,1,ParaSight-F rapid manual diagnostic test of Plasmodium falciparum infection.,"The ParaSight(R)-F test is a qualitative diagnostic test of Plasmodium falciparum, which is based on the detection by a monoclonal antibody of a species-specific soluble antigen (histidine-rich protein (HRP-II)) in whole blood and which can be performed without special equipment. A visual reading is given by a polyclonal antibody coupled with dye-loaded liposomes; when positive, a pink line appears. The test has been compared with microscopic examination of thin blood smears and with Quantitative Buffy Coat malaria test (QBC(R) in a single-blind study. A total of 358 patients who had returned to France from malarial areas and consulted their doctor with symptoms or for a routine examination were enrolled in the study; 33 of them were found to have a falciparum malaria infection by the diagnostic test. On the day of consultation, the specificity of the ParaSight(R)-F test was 99% and its sensitivity 94%. The follow-up of infected patients after treatment showed that the test became negative later than the other reference tests. There was no correlation between antigen persistence and the intensity of the ParaSight(R)-F signal or circulating parasitaemia. No cross-reaction was noted for seven malaria cases due to other Plasmodium species. The test was performed quickly (10 tests in 20 minutes), was easy to read, and required minimal space. For cases of imported malaria, the test's specificity and low threshold for detection could make it a valuable adjunct test. However, in its present form, it cannot replace microscopic techniques which are species-specific and quantitative. In endemic areas, the test seems to be very promising by its results and ease of use according to published field studies."
CD008122,0,6433537,0,Dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dot-ELISA): comparison with standard ELISA and complement fixation assays for the diagnosis of human visceral leishmaniasis.,"The dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dot-ELISA), standard ELISA and the complement fixation (CF) tests were compared in the serodiagnosis of African visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar). Assay sensitivity was determined using sera from 44 patients with parasitologically confirmed kala-azar. Using the Dot-ELISA, 42 of 44 patients (95%) were positive at a reciprocal titer of greater than or equal to 32 (titer range 512-524 288). In the standard ELISA technique, 43 of 44 patients (98%) were positive (titer range 32-32 768). At a reciprocal titer of greater than or equal to 8 in the CF test, 35 patients (80%) were positive, 1 (2%) was negative and 8 patients (18%) showed anticomplementary (AC) activity (titer range 8-2048). Specificity, determined using 33 sera from healthy individuals not living in endemic areas, was 97% in both the Dot-ELISA and the standard ELISA (32 of 33 sera); in he CF test, all sera were negative except 1 (3%) which showed AC activity. Sera from patients with Chagas' disease cross-reacted in the dot-ELISA up to a titer of 512. In the standard ELISA, cross-reactions occurred mainly using sera from patients with Chagas' disease, malaria and syphilis, and to a lesser extent with sera from amebiasis, schistosomiasis and trichinosis patients. Overall titer agreement in replicate experiments was highest in the Dot-ELISA (89%), followed by the standard ELISA (80%) and the CF test (72%)."
CD008122,0,10747278,0,Submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum infections in pregnancy in Ghana.,"Malarial parasitaemia below the threshold of microscopy but detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays is common in endemic regions. This study was conducted to examine prevalence, predictors, and effects of submicroscopic Plasmodium falciparum infections in pregnancy. In a cross-sectional study among 530 pregnant women in Ghana, plasmodial infections were assessed by microscopy and PCR assays. Concentrations of haemoglobin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured and antimalarial drugs (chloroquine, pyrimethamine) in urine were demonstrated by ELISA dipsticks. By microscopy, 32% of the women were found to harbour malaria parasites. This rate increased to 63% adding the results of the parasite-specific PCR. P. falciparum was present in all but one infection. With increasing gravidity, infection rates and parasite densities decreased and the proportions of submicroscopic parasitaemia among infected women grew. Correspondingly, anaemia, fever and evidence of inflammation (CRP > 0.6 mg/dl) were more frequent in primigravidae than in multigravidae. Antimalarial drugs were detected in 65% of the women and were associated with a reduced prevalence of P. falciparum infections and a raised proportion of submicroscopic parasitaemia. Both gravidity and antimalarial drug use were independent predictors of submicroscopic P. falciparum infections. These infections caused a slight reduction of Hb levels and considerably increased serum concentrations of CRP. Conventional microscopy underestimates the actual extent of malarial infections in pregnancy in endemic regions. Submicroscopic P. falciparum infections are frequent and may contribute to mild anaemia and inflammation in seemingly aparasitaemic pregnant women."
CD008122,0,9773192,0,[The microwave oven for drying thick blood smears. Benefits and limits for microscopic observation of Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites and gametocytes].,"The micro-wave oven permits a rapid drying of thick blood smears classically used for parasitological malaria diagnosis. In order to evaluate this type of drying on the microscopic reading, a study was carried out in an hyperendemic area of malaria with 382 asymptomatic volunteers of all ages. Two thick smears were made for each volunteer, one immediately dried with a micro-wave oven for one minute, the second dried in the open air without any intervention. A single microscopist examined all the thick smears. The observation of Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites differed significantly between the two methods, the prevalence was 50% by normal drying versus 41% by the micro-wave oven. The geometric mean of the trophozoite number for positive thick smears was significantly lower with the micro-wave oven. When the parasitological density with normal drying was lower than 200 trophozoites/microliter of blood, 54% of results were wrongly negative with the micro-wave oven. On the other hand, the observation of P. falciparum gametocytes was significantly facilitated after drying with the micro-wave oven; the prevalence was 8% with normal drying versus 12% by micro-wave oven. In conclusion, the use of the micro-wave oven for the drying of thick smears is not recommended for malaria diagnosis although it improves the observation and counting of P. falciparum gametocytes."

Optimal methods of testing and the effects of age and transmission intensity on these responses are unknown. IFN-gamma responses to LSA-1 and TRAP peptides were assessed by the enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in children and adults from areas of stable and unstable malaria transmission in Kenya. Adults in the areas of stable and unstable transmission had similar frequencies and levels of IFN-gamma responses to LSA-1 and TRAP as determined by ELISPOT and ELISA. In contrast, IFN-gamma responses to the LSA-1 T3 peptide (assessed by ELISPOT) and to any LSA-1 peptide (assessed by ELISA) were less frequent in children in the area of unstable transmission than in children in the area of stable transmission. IFN-gamma responses to LSA-1 were more frequently detected by ELISA than by ELISPOT in the stable-transmission area. IFN-gamma responses detected by ELISA and ELISPOT did not correlate with each other. In children in the stable-transmission area, IFN-gamma responses to LSA-1 peptides assessed by ELISA, but not by ELISPOT, were associated with protection against clinical malaria and anemia. IFN-gamma responses to LSA-1 appear to require repeated P. falciparum exposure and/or increased age and, as measured by ELISA, are associated with protection against clinical malaria and anemia."
CD008122,0,17035513,0,Multiplex assay for simultaneous measurement of antibodies to multiple Plasmodium falciparum antigens.,"Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum are classically measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although highly sensitive, this technique is labor-intensive when large numbers of samples must be screened against multiple antigens. The suspension array technology (SAT) might be an alterative to ELISA, as it allows measurement of antibodies against multiple antigens simultaneously with a small volume of sample. This study sought to adapt the new SAT multiplex system for measuring antibodies against nine malarial vaccine candidate antigens, including recombinant proteins from two variants of merozoite surface protein 1, two variants of apical merozoite antigen 1, erythrocyte binding antigen 175, merozoite surface protein 3, and peptides from the circumsporozoite protein, ring erythrocyte surface antigen, and liver-stage antigen 1. Various concentrations of the antigens were coupled to microspheres with different spectral addresses, and plasma samples from Cameroonian adults were screened by SAT in mono- and multiplex formats and by ELISA. Optimal amounts of protein required to perform the SAT assay were 10- to 100-fold less than that needed for ELISA. Excellent agreement was found between the single and multiplex formats (R > or = 0.96), even when two variants of the same antigen were used. The multiplex assay was rapid, reproducible, required less than 1 mul of plasma, and had a good correlation with ELISA. Thus, SAT provides an important new tool for studying the immune response to malaria rapidly and efficiently in large populations, even when the amount of plasma available is limited, e.g., in studies of neonates or finger-prick blood."

CD008122,0,1298062,0,Seroepidemiological studies of malaria in different endemic areas of Indonesia.,"A total of 618 sera from inhabitants living in various endemic areas in Indonesia were examined for IgG against Plasmodium falciparum utilizing young trophozoites and mature schizonts as antigens by the method of ELISA and IFAT. In general, antibodies against trophozites (RESA) based on ELISA and antibodies against schizonts based on IFAT showed a correlation of malarial antibodies with the level of endemicity of the area examined. Anti-RESA antibody, detected either by ELISA or IFAT was more pronounced in the aparasitemic group compared to the parasitemic group. On the contrary, anti-schizont antibody measured by IFAT was more pronounced in the parasitemic group. Malarial antibody levels against the schizont-merozoite fraction of P. falciparum as assayed by ELISA appeared to develop more slowly compared to levels based on IFAT."
CD008122,0,3325284,0,Specific and nonspecific immunodiagnostic properties of recombinant and synthetic Plasmodium falciparum antigens.,"Six Plasmodium falciparum/beta-galactosidase fusion proteins produced by a genomic DNA expression library, and two synthetic Plasmodium falciparum antigens were applied to ELISA and tested for their immunodiagnostic properties. Results were compared to reference methods, i.e. fluorescence antibody test with whole cell antigen and ELISA with detergent-soluble crude schizont antigen. Anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies could be detected by these molecular antigens to varying extents in human sera. Undesired reactivity to fusion proteins due to the high prevalence of antibodies to beta-galactosidase in human sera and undesired reactivity to one of the synthetic antigens (P12) frequently occurred. The antibodies responsible for the nonspecific reactivity could not be identified. It was concluded that the application of molecular Plasmodium falciparum antigens to ELISA represents a practicable approach to immunodiagnosis of malaria if the construction of epitopes that bind antibodies other than Plasmodium falciparum antibodies can be avoided."

Of 557 consecutive patients, 109 (19.6%) had documented malaria. For the NOW ICT MALARIA P.f./P.v. (Binax, Portland, ME, USA) and OptiMAL IT (Diamed, Cressier, Switzerland) tests, respectively, sensitivity values were 96.3% and 79.8% (P-value, 0.0001), and specificity values were 98.8% and 98.4%. The NOW ICT test did not detect two of 80 Plasmodium falciparum infections, and it generated false-positive results for five patients. The OptiMAL IT test failed to detect ten of the P. falciparum infections, and it generated seven false-positive results. The results suggest that these rapid diagnostic tests for malaria may be useful, but they cannot replace microscopic examination of blood films."

CD008122,0,2208562,0,Ascertainment of risk of serious adverse reactions associated with chemoprophylactic antimalarial drugs.,"Serious adverse reactions during malaria chemoprophylaxis are reviewed. Three drugs considered to have caused serious reactions in recent years are pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (Fansidar), pyrimethamine/dapsone (Maloprim) and amodiaquine. These reactions are principally independent of dose and cannot be determined during screening for optimal doses. However, host factors may precipitate dose-dependent reactions, some of which could be avoided with improvements in drug licensing. Since serious and life-threatening reactions are relatively rare (between 1:1000 and 1:20,000), Phase I to III trials cannot identify them. Reliance must therefore be placed on Phase IV post-marketing studies, including ongoing reviews of national registers, and specially tailored studies to identify the risk using prescription-event monitoring in high-risk populations. Occasionally, medical-record linkage, case-control and cohort studies may provide supportive data. Although large numbers of travellers must, of necessity, be exposed to a drug before relatively rare reactions are identified, the ascertainment of risk using post-marketing surveillance was prevented by the following five deficiencies: lack of awareness of early alerts, inadequate use of national registers, poor attention to epidemiological and statistical rigour, inadequate verification of denominators, and inadequacy of data records. Recommendations are given for minimizing such errors in the future."

CD008122,0,15365017,1,"Persistent histidine-rich protein 2, parasite lactate dehydrogenase, and panmalarial antigen reactivity after clearance of Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection.","We tested 240 patients with Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection for persistent parasite antigenemia after successful standardized antimalarial therapy by using the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv and OptiMAL-IT assays that detect the malaria antigens Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) and parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), respectively, as well as a panmalarial antigen (PMA). The patients were screened for antigenemia on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 of follow-up. On day 0, all 240 patients showed positive reactivity with both assays. Of the 229 cases with negative parasitemia on day 3, persistent antigenemia was observed in 207 (90.4%) of the cases: 188 (82.1%) for HRP2 antigen and 75 (32.8%) for PMA. There was a gradual decrease in antigenemia on follow-up to day 14; however, the drop in reactivity to PMA was less than that for HRP2 antigen. In contrast to HRP2 antigenemia, there was a significant decrease in pLDH antigenemia to 38.4% and to 14.8% (PMA) on day 3 (P < 0.03). The pLDH antigenemia level dropped further to 14.8% on day 7. There was no significant association of persistent antigenemia with gametocytemia. One case with gametocytemia was negative for both the antigens. In conclusion, the OptiMAL-IT assay is more sensitive than the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test for monitoring therapeutic responses after antimalarial therapy since the LDH activity ceases when the malarial parasite dies."
CD008122,0,7997752,0,Malaria serology: performance of six Plasmodium falciparum antigen extracts and of three ways of determining serum titers in IgG and IgM-ELISA.,"The study evaluated six Plasmodium falciparum antigen extracts to be used in the IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), for malaria diagnosis and epidemiological studies. Results obtained with eighteen positive and nine negative control sera indicated that there were statistically significant differences among these antigen extracts (Multifactor ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Urea, sodium deoxycholate and Zwittergent antigen extracts performed better than did the three others, their features being very similar for the detection of IgG antibodies. Urea, alkaline and sodium deoxycholate antigen extracts proved to be better than the others for the detection of IgM antibodies. A straight line relationship was found between the optical densities (or their respective log10) and the log10 of antibody dilutions, with a very constant slope. Thus serum titers could be determined by direct titration and by two different equations, needing only one serum dilution. For IgM antibody detections, log10 expression gave results that better correlated with direct titration (95% Bonferroni). For IgG antibody detections, the titer differences were not significant. The reproducibility of antibody titers and antigen batches was also evaluated, giving satisfactory results."

CD008122,0,9030870,0,Wild isolates of Plasmodium falciparum malaria show decreased sensitivity to in vitro inhibition of parasite growth mediated by autologous host antibodies.,"Antigenic diversity in field populations of Plasmodium falciparum parasites may delay the acquisition of protective immunity to malaria, the development of which may thus require repeated exposure to infection over a prolonged period of time. In this study we show that P. falciparum parasites may vary in their sensitivity to antibody-mediated invasion/growth inhibition in vitro. Wild isolates of P. falciparum from children living in an endemic area of Burkina Faso were tested for their sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of antibodies originating from the same (autologous) and from other donors (heterologous). A significantly lower invasion inhibition activity was obtained when the isolates and antibodies were tested in autologous compared with heterologous combinations. The lower sensitivity to growth inhibition by autologous antibodies may be due to immune pressure in vivo, selecting from a heterogeneous parasite population those with a low expression of the antigens recognized by the host's antibodies. Alternatively, the parasites cultured from each child might represent expanding parasite populations, mainly constituting strains not earlier seen by the immune system of that specific host. The results reinforce the concern about Plasmodium antigenic diversity as a major obstacle towards the development of an effective malaria vaccine."
CD008122,0,14573641,0,Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum rifin proteins are associated with rapid parasite clearance and asymptomatic infections.,"Plasmodium falciparum rifin proteins, belonging to the largest known family of variable infected-erythrocyte surface-expressed proteins encoded by rif genes, were recently shown to be capable of inducing a strong immune response in P. falciparum-infected adults living in an area in Gabon where malaria is endemic. In the present study, the levels of antirifin antibodies were analyzed in serum obtained from 60 children from the same area who were admitted to hospital and diagnosed with severe malaria. High antirifin antibody concentrations in these individuals correlated significantly with their capacity to rapidly clear their parasites from the circulation after the start of chemotherapy. A doubling of antirifin antibody concentrations reduced the clearance time by 5 h (95% confidence interval, 4.1 to 6.9 h). In the same group of children, who were followed up for 2 years, antirifin antibody levels did not correlate with a reduced rate of reinfection or with a delay in the time to the first reinfection. However, the initial antirifin antibody levels were sustained over the study period. The likelihood that these antibodies could confer a certain degree of protection against malaria is supported by our findings of statistically higher levels of antirifin antibodies to all four rifin proteins in a group of 42 asymptomatic parasitemic children."

Two Plasmodium falciparum testing systems, namely MalaQuick (ICT) and ParaSight F were used. Test performance and test interpretation of pre-prepared tests were compared. There was no significant difference in test performance between the 2 tests. Interpretation of prepared test strips in both test systems was very reliable in blood parasite densities between 0.1% and 2%, but major problems were encountered at low parasitaemia (< 0.1% blood parasites) and also in ParaSight F test strips showing high parasitaemia (> 2% blood parasites). Low parasitaemia ParaSight F test strips were correctly interpreted by 52.1% compared with 10.8% correct interpretations with MalaQuick (P < 0.0001). Correct interpretation of highly positive (> 2% blood parasites) pre-prepared test strips was higher with MalaQuick (96.8%) than with ParaSight F (33.8%), P < 0.0001. Both tests were associated with high levels of false-negative interpretations which render them unsuitable as self-diagnostic kits. Efforts must be made to assist lay individuals in test performance by technical test improvement, by equiping the test strips with an additional reading aid for interpretation, and by providing instruction by a skilled person."
CD008122,0,10497989,0,The development of an immunoassay for the detection of artemisinin compounds in urine.,"We have produced monoclonal antibodies against artelinic acid and investigated the reactivity with artemisinin drugs and metabolites. Antibody F170-10 is fairly specific for artelinic acid but does bind artemisinin and artemether (3-5% cross-reactivity). Dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, and metabolites of artemisinin showed less reactivity. With this antibody, an inhibition ELISA has been set up to detect artemisinin compounds in urine. In healthy subjects who received a single oral dose of artemisinin, artemether, artesunate or dihydroartemisinin, ELISA reactivity in urine was found. This reactivity in urine paralleled the plasma concentrations of artemether and dihydroartemisinin. The results show that this immunoassay for artelinic acid can be used to detect artemisinin compounds in urine for about 8 hr after intake. With a more sensitive test, this simple method as a urine dipstick may be become useful for drug use and compliance studies in malaria-endemic areas where the artemisinin derivatives are increasingly used."

A schizont lysate from P. falciparum infected red blood cells from FUP/CB Marburg strain as antigen proved usefullness, as compared with an antigen extracted from a local strain recently adapted to in vitro culture. Using these techniques, high specific antibody responses were found in the villagers' sera and mean levels of antibodies increased with age.

CD008122,0,19704115,0,ABO blood group glycans modulate sialic acid recognition on erythrocytes.,"ABH(O) blood group polymorphisms are based on well-known intraspecies variations in structures of neutral blood cell surface glycans in humans and other primates. Whereas natural antibodies against these glycans can act as barriers to blood transfusion and transplantation, the normal functions of this long-standing evolutionary polymorphism remain largely unknown. Although microbial interactions have been suggested as a selective force, direct binding of lethal pathogens to ABH antigens has not been reported. We show in this study that ABH antigens found on human erythrocytes modulate the specific interactions of 3 sialic acid-recognizing proteins (human Siglec-2, 1918SC influenza hemagglutinin, and Sambucus nigra agglutinin) with sialylated glycans on the same cell surface. Using specific glycosidases that convert A and B glycans to the underlying H(O) structure, we show ABH antigens stabilize sialylated glycan clusters on erythrocyte membranes uniquely for each blood type, generating differential interactions of the 3 sialic acid-binding proteins with erythrocytes from each blood type. We further show that by stabilizing such structures ABH antigens can also modulate sialic acid-mediated interaction of pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum malarial parasite. Thus, ABH antigens can noncovalently alter the presentation of other cell surface glycans to cognate-binding proteins, without themselves being a direct ligand."
CD008122,0,11676365,0,Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling of the antimalarial activity of mefloquine.,"Treatment protocols for the chemotherapy of malaria are usually acquired through clinical trials. Once pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information becomes available, it is possible to use mathematical modelling for testing these protocols and, possibly, for improving them. In this report the case of monotherapy by mefloquine is analysed. Published pharmacokinetic and clinical results are used to derive the essential model parameters such as kill rate, parasite growth rates, drug sensitivity and the pharmacokinetic parameters. Good agreement is obtained between clinical results and simulated parasite numbers using the derived parameters. It is demonstrated that the 2 exponential kinetics of mefloquine elimination can be reduced to an operational single exponent for pharmacodynamic modelling by educated choice of sampling times of plasma drug concentration. It is deduced that a second drug dose, at a properly chosen time-interval, results in radical cure even when resistant parasites are present and at maximal parasite growth rates such as those found in non-immune patients. Finally, a table is provided for guiding the optimal choice of dosing intervals under different values of population pharmacokinetics, drug resistance and individual immunity parameters."

Sera collected from persons with various degrees of exposure to malaria were selected: sera from inhabitants of a malaria endemic area (Group I), European patients with acute malaria infection (Group II) and blood donors with clinical symptoms of sickness or fever during a stay in malaria endemic areas. 86% of the sera gave concording results by ELISA MIXT and IFA. The correlation was 100% for sera of Group I but discrepancies were observed for Groups II and III. The great majority of the differences were due to sera positive on ELISA MIXT but not by IFA. Most of the sera positive on ELISA MIXT reacted with parasite-derived components only on Western-blot. These results underline the potential of the ELISA MIXT for epidemiologic studies."
CD008122,0,2051525,0,A study on malaria infection during the acute stage of measles infection.,"The recognized high mortality from measles in Africa is considered to be partly due to the flare-up of concomitant malaria infection. In 1987 there was a measles epidemic in the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania, in spite of recent vaccination campaigns. A comparative study was therefore conducted on the densities of malaria parasites in children during the acute stage of measles (67 consecutive cases, aged 5 months-19 years). The period of study was March-June, the peak season for malaria transmission. For each measles patient, a blood film was concomitantly taken from an asymptomatic age-matched child from the same village. Of 67 children with measles, 17 (25%) had parasitaemia ranging from 8 to 2480 parasites microliter-1 blood. Out of 67 asymptomatic control children 59 (88%) had parasitaemia ranging from 8 to 3400 parasites microliter-1 blood. This study indicates that malaria densities were lower during the acute stage of measles than in healthy children. The contribution of malaria to mortality in children with acute measles may be questioned."

Seventy-one children, mean age 2.9 years (range 4 months-6.8 years), were enrolled; 34 children had severe malaria, 23 had mild (non-severe) malaria and 14 had no malaria. TNF alpha levels were significantly elevated in children with severe malaria compared with those with non-severe malaria and the uninfected group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.00001, respectively). The levels correlated directly with parasite densities (r = 0.54, P < 0.002). Among the children with severe malaria, TNF alpha levels correlated directly with the degree of anaemia but inversely with age. High tumour necrosis factor levels were associated with manifestations of severe malaria infection but declined to normal levels after effective antimalarial treatment."
CD008122,0,15962627,0,[Diagnosis of malaria in general practice: dealing with uncertainty].,"Malaria is the disease to exclude when dealing with a patient coming back from an endemic area with fever. We need reliable diagnostic tools with negative likelihood ratio (LR-) close to zero (-> high negative predictive value). Ideally, a microscopical examination (ME) (thick and thin film) should be done, with or without a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). When the ME is not immediately available, an RDT can be done in the practice office and the ME delayed for 6-12 hours, provided there is no danger sign or thrombopenia. Indeed, the LR- of RDT being of 0.08 (estimated in a meta-analysis of RDT in non-immune travelers), the probability of falciparum malaria is 1% after a negative RDT. When the RDT is positive, the patient should always be treated with an anti-malarial, even if the ME is negative."

The purpose of this study was to make a human reference standard for MSP-1(42) antibody measured in absolute quantity units using pooled plasma samples known to contain high titers of MSP-1(42) antibody based on previous ELISA results. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography was used to determine the amount of MSP-1(42) antibody in this plasma pool. Hexahistidine-tagged MSP-1(42) antigen adsorbed to nickel-chelating resin was used to capture MSP-1(42) antibody from the plasma pool. The intact MSP-1(42) antibody-antigen complexes were eluted and total IgG was measured by an ELISA standardized against purified human IgG. In this way, the human reference standard was determined to contain 48.3 microg/mL of MSP-1(42) antibody. This reference standard may be useful as a quantitative working standard for measuring MSP-1(42) antibody response in future vaccine clinical trials involving MSP-1."

The eastern coastal zone--an area of perennial malaria transmission--is regularly exposed to cyclones. Few malaria studies have been done in this area of Madagascar, and none have examined the potential relationship between malaria and natural disasters. A mobile team spent six weeks in the fields doing three lines of research: an entomological study by catching mosquitoes and determining their species: a therapeutic study of chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) according to a 14 days WHO protocol and also a study of physician's diagnostic ability. Physicians were asked to make a presumptive clinical diagnosis of all febrile patients, and these results were compared to those obtained from blood smear examinations. The entomological study found three major vectors species: Anopheles gambiae, An. funestus and An. mascarensis. The therapeutic study showed that SP was 100% effective (n = 13) and only one case of CQ treatment failure was recorded (1/15). Finally the diagnostic study demonstrated that presumptive diagnosis of malaria based on the only clinical signs leads to an over-estimation of malaria frequency. Over 68% (102/149) of febrile patients were diagnosed by physicians to have malaria while only 52 (34.9%) were proven positive. Of the 47 patients diagnosed clinically as malaria-negative, 12 (25.5%) turned out to be positive. Outbreaks of malaria during or after natural disasters in Madagascar can be successfully treated with either CQ or SP, but compliance may be better with SP since it requires only one dose. Perhaps equally important in the context of natural disasters is to have the capacity to make a definitive diagnosis, and the dipsticks should be made available."
CD008122,0,7077053,0,Cholinesterase activities of workers exposed to organophosphorus insecticides in Pakistan and Haiti and an evaluation of the tintometric method.,"Five reference laboratories were established in Pakistan for monitoring cholinesterase (ChE) activities of workers exposed to organophosphorus compounds. ChE activities were determined by the Michel and tintometric method. Observations of ChE activities were made during two malaria seasons. The first season showed that although a significant depression of cholinesterase occurred among some of the workers, the ChE activities of workers were within the normal range during the following season. The reason for the difference is discussed. Similar studies were undertaken in Haiti. Mean and standard deviations (SD) were calculated for comparison of the tintometric versus the Michel method. The data show a correlation between the methods. For further evaluation of the tintometric method, organophosphorus and oxon analog inhibition of cholinesterase were determined in vitro. The tabulated data show that the tintometric method is adequate for determining whether a worker is exposed to dangerous amounts of insecticides."

The results of the tests were compared to the results of the parasitic examination of the peripheral blood with light microscopy (thick and thin smears). The HRP-2 test showed very high sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (94.1%) for Plasmodiumfalciparum parasitaemia and none or very low sensitivity and specificity for other malaria species. The HRP-2 test detected both asexual and sexual stages of the Plasmodium falciparum parasites. The test did not show significant changes in detection of different levels of parasitaemia. These findings enable to conclude that the HRP-2 immunochromatographic assay can be very helpful to diagnose Plasmodium falciparum malaria when microscopy examination is not available, but as qualitative tests can be difficult for interpretation especially in high malaria risk areas. Therefore it can require re-examination of blood with microscopy to confirm species and development stages of Plasmodium spp. and to assess parasite load."

Immunization with a mixture of these plasmids circumvented the genetic restriction of protective immunity and induced additive protection. A third DNA vaccine encoding the P. yoelii sporozoite surface protein 2 (PySSP2) also induced protection. The P. falciparum genes encoding the homologues of these three protective P. yoelii antigens as well as another P. falciparum gene encoding a protein that is expressed in infected hepatocytes have been chosen for the development of a human vaccine. The optimal plasmid constructs for human use will be selected on the basis of immunogenicity data generated in mice and nonhuman primates. We anticipate that optimization of multi-gene P. falciparum DNA vaccines designed to protect against malaria by inducing CD8+ T cells that target infected hepatocytes will require extensive clinical trials during the coming years.

We performed ELISA to asses IgG and IgM seropositivity rates against three PfEMP1 DBL-alpha domains from 42 maternal-cord paired samples obtained at delivery from a hyperendemic area in Gabon. IgG was present in up to 80% of the cord serum samples, while IgM was found in only 20% of the same samples. These levels were not dependent on the parity of the mother or the peripheral and placental infectious status.

CD008122,0,16989636,0,The potential role of fowlpox virus in rational vaccine design.,"The design of optimal vaccines requires detailed knowledge of how protective immune responses are generated in vivo under normal circumstances. This approach to vaccine development, where the immune correlates of protection are defined and vaccines are designed to elicit the same response, is called rational vaccine design. Poxviruses are attractive candidates for inclusion in such design strategies owing to their large genome, which allows for the inclusion of multiple heterologous genes, including those encoding antigens, co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines. Fowlpox virus, the prototypical member of the Avipoxvirus genus, is particularly suitable, as it is also incapable of replicating in mammalian cells. The potential of recombinant fowlpox virus as a safe vaccine vector is being evaluated currently in a number of clinical trials for diseases, including HIV, malaria and various types of cancer.

Immunofixation and quantification of C3d were better for detecting complement activation, their sensitivity rates (90.5% and 89.3%, respectively) being higher than those of the other tests studied. Immunofixation is a relatively simple and inexpensive test, provides good resolution of protein bands, and yields results that are easily quantified with a densitometer. Nephelometry of C3d provides more rapid and accurate quantitative results than immunofixation, but commercial reagents are not yet available.

The study subjects were patients who were enrolled at medical care clinics or in their homes by Peruvian Ministry of Health (MOH) workers as part of the passive and active disease surveillance program of the MOH. The clinical criterion for enrollment was the diagnosis of a suspected viral-associated, acute, undifferentiated febrile illness of < or = 5 days duration. A total of 598 patients were enrolled in the study. Demographic information, medical history, clinical data, and blood samples were obtained from each patient. The more common clinical features were fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-ocular pain, and chills. Sera were tested for virus by the newborn mouse and cell culture assays. Viral isolates were identified initially by immunofluorescence using polyclonal antibody. An ELISA using viral-specific monoclonal antibodies and nucleotide sequence analysis were used to determine the specific variety of the viruses. In addition, thin and thick blood smears were observed for malaria parasites. Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus subtype I, variety ID virus was isolated from 10 cases, including three cases in October, November, and December 1993, five cases in January and February 1994, and two cases in June 1995. The ELISA for IgM and IgG antibody indicated that VEE virus was the cause of an additional four confirmed and four presumptive cases, including five from January through March 1994 and three in August 1994. Sixteen cases were positive for malaria. The 18 cases of VEE occurred among military recruits (n = 7), agriculture workers (n = 3), students (n = 3), and general laborers (n = 5).

Data were collected using focus group disusions(FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). Results showed that malaria was perceived as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women. However, adolescent girls did not consider themselves at risk of malaria even when pregnant. Anaemia and low birth weight were not well understood and not related to malaria in pregnancy. Self-medication was common including over the counter drugs, herbs or a combination of both. When this failed, several options were taken such as seeking care at health units. People preferred to visit heath units with laboratory facilities, since investigations were valued and perceived useful. These investigations were locally known as okukebera omusayi, which translates to examining blood This local term is non-specific and used when patients are referred to laboratories to investigate diseases like HIV, syphilis and malaria. The use of this term however, discourages some people who are afraid of knowing their HIV status. Similarly, the notion that HIV/AIDS is spread thorough contaminated needles and syringes discourages people from giving blood for laboratory tests. In addition, the cost of investigations, fear of pain due to pricking, and the rudeness of laboratory technicians negatively influence seeking laboratory tests. Implications of these findings include developing a health promotion package that explains the dangers of self medication and advocates prompt seeking for malaria treatment especially for adolescents and primigravidae. Policy decisions to introduce rapid diagnostic kits (RDTs) in primary care units including drug shops are required in order to improve effective treatment of malaria."

Malaria parasite DNA in blood from a fingerprick was directly amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two sets of primers to yield a 206-basepair (bp) product for Plasmodium falciparum and a 183-bp product for P. vivax. Both were easily visualized in an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, allowing identification of the two human malaria species in a single amplification reaction. As little as a one P. falciparum and/or P. vivax parasite per microliter of blood was detectable by this method, a sensitivity superior to that of thick blood film microscopy. The total time required for diagnosis of 48 blood samples, starting from fingerprick blood collection, was approximately 4 hr. When compared with microscopic examination by an expert microscopist, results showed a sensitivity of 89% for P. falciparum and 91% for P. vivax and an overall specificity of 94%. Six infected blood samples classified by microscopy as single species were diagnosed by the PCR method as being mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax infections. The high sensitivity, rapidity, and simplicity of the method should make it attractive for a large-scale epidemiology study, follow-up of drug treatment, and immunization trials."
CD008122,0,11843905,0,Prevention and management of infections in patients without a spleen.,"Patients who lack a functioning spleen become vulnerable to sepsis caused by bacteria and, occasionally, protozoa. The risk is higher in children and in those who have had immunosuppressive treatment, and the risk remains lifelong. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) occurs at an estimated incidence of 0.23-0.42% per year, with a lifetime risk of 5%. Episodes of OPSI are emergencies, requiring immediate parental antibiotics and intensive care; intravenous immunoglobulins may be useful. OPSI carries a mortality of 38-69%. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest infecting organism, accounting for 50-90% of isolates from blood cultures in reported series; it is particularly common in children with sickle cell disease. Less commonly, the infecting organisms are other bacteria, Babesia or Ehrlichia. OPSI may be, to some extent, preventable by several interventions. These are surgical conservation of the spleen; immunization against S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis; prophylactic antibiotics; stand-by antibiotics; patient information sheets; and a medical alert bracelet. Asplenic patients living in malaria-endemic areas require optimal prophylaxis. The initial step in prevention of OPSI is the creation of an asplenia register, as many patients are not covered by these simple measures."

Their role in sporozoite immunity in the human host has, however, not yet been elucidated. Immunological non-responsiveness and antigenic diversity within T cell epitopes of the CS protein have been identified as potential problems in producing a sporozoite vaccine. These factors may contribute to the widespread lack of sporozoite immunity in endemic populations. In this study, 137 individuals with a history of natural endemic exposure to falciparum sporozoites (119 resident in north west Thailand and 18 resident in coastal Papua New Guinea) were tested for a CTL response to the Plasmodium falciparum CS protein. Fifty-four overlapping peptides, spanning the entire sequence of the CS protein of P. falciparum including most known variants, were studied.

Screening of blood donors or treatment of transfused patients or prospective donors does not eliminate this hazard. It is essential to kill the parasite in vitro in the blood of donors before transfusion. A total of 4,484 blood donors were screened for malaria parasite microscopically using the Giemsa staining technique. Only 30 matched the inclusion criteria of this study. Blood samples were divided into four equal samples. Three concentrations of sulfadoxine-pyremthamine (SP) were added to 90 specimens, and none was added to 30 specimens (controls). Blood specimens were then tested by parasitic, biochemical, and hematologic techniques on the day of collection and after 24 and 48 hours of storage in a blood bank refrigerator. The reduction of malaria parasites was proportional to the concentrations of SP and to the storage period. Blood samples without SP had steady number of the parasites. The lethal dose of SP (the dose that killed 99% of the malaria parasites within 24 hours) was 179.65 mug/L and was highly effective within the 24-hour storage period. This dose did not affect constituents of the stored blood. Thus, for eradication of transfusion-induced malaria by in vitro processing of donors blood, SP is a safe and effective drug. It is recommended that optimal doses of SP be added to donated blood prior to phlebotomy."

Recent changes, including a shift from predominance of Plasmodium vivax to Plasmodium falciparum, appearance of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum and decreased effectiveness of vector control programs have been observed. Epidemiological features of malaria were studied through four six-month surveys of a population of 16,500 in Madang Province from 1981-1983. Baseline data on parasitology, splenic enlargement, serology, hemoglobin levels, prevalence of 4-aminoquinolines, utilization of mosquito nets and incidence of fever were collected for use in future evaluation of malaria control measures including possible field trials of an antimalarial vaccine. Prevalence of parasitemia (all species, all ages) varied from 35.0% to 42.7% over the four surveys each of which covered a random sample of 25% of the population. The ratio of parasite species was: P. falciparum 70:P. vivax 25:P. malariae 5 in the dry seasons, shifting slightly in favor of P. falciparum during the wet seasons. Intense year-round transmission was indicated by decreasing parasite prevalence and splenic enlargement with age, low density asymptomatic parasitemias and high prevalence of antimalarial antibodies (i.e., greater than 80% of the population over five years of age was ELISA-positive). Levels of endemicity varied geographically, presence of 4-aminoquinolines in urine samples was relatively common (12.7% positive) and chloroquine resistance was widespread (81.6% in vitro, 46.6% in vivo)."

No clear-cut relationship to the development of clinical immunity was found when the overall antibody activities to total parasite antigens were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although there was a certain rise of IgM, total IgG- and IgG2 antibody activities, this was most pronounced at ages when a clinical but nonsterile immunity is already present. When the sera were investigated by immunoprecipitation of 35S-methionine labeled parasite polypeptides, the total number of parasite antigens precipitated was similar at all ages. Analysis by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA), registering antibodies to intracellular parasite antigens, revealed no age-dependent changes in antibody titers. In contrast, when the sera were assayed by a novel IFA, specific for a restricted number of parasite antigens in the membrane of infected erythrocytes, the frequency of positive sera as well as the anti-P. falciparum titers rose in parallel with the development of clinical immunity. Thus, these antigens appeared to be important inducers of protective immune responses and may be suitable candidates for a vaccine against the asexual blood stages of P. falciparum."
CD008122,0,3311441,0,"The efficiency of sporozoite transmission in the human malarias, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax.","Reported are malaria sporozoite and inoculation rates over a 1-year period in eight epidemiologically defined villages of different endemicity in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. In the study, more than 41 000 wild-caught mosquitos were analysed for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax sporozoites by ELISA. In a given village the entomological inoculation rates correlated strongly with the prevalences of both these malarial parasites in children. However, the prevalence of P. falciparum infections in children was much higher than that of P. vivax, despite similar inoculation rates for the two species. These data suggest that in Papua New Guinea P. falciparum is more efficiently transmitted than P. vivax from mosquito to man. The increased efficiency of transmission of P. falciparum may be due to the heavier sporozoite densities in wild-caught mosquitos naturally infected with P. falciparum sporozoites that were tenfold greater than the sporozoite densities in mosquitos infected with P. vivax."
CD008122,0,10586910,0,Anti-malarial drug use among preschool children in an area of seasonal malaria transmission in Kenya.,"The aims of this study were to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic Kenyan preschool children using anti-malarial drugs, to identify factors associated with chloroquine use, and to assess the validity of frequency of febrile episodes and drug use reported by mothers or carers. Of 318 children studied, 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 30-47%]) tested positive for chloroquine or sulfadoxine. Of chloroquine-positive children, 15% had concentrations exceeding the estimated minimum therapeutically effective values. Among those testing negative for sulfadoxine, chloroquine-positive children were more frequently parasitemic (odds ratio = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.3-5.2), and had lower mean hemoglobin concentrations (6.1 g/L, 95% CI = 2.1-10.1) than chloroquine-negative children. Mothers over-reported the frequency of malaria or fever episodes as usually defined in medical studies, and underreported anti-malarial drug use. We conclude that anti-malarials are frequently given for treatment of malaria or malaria-associated illness, rather than prophylactically or for symptoms unrelated to malaria. Questionnaire surveys cannot replace biochemical markers to obtain information on anti-malarial drug use."
CD008122,0,10432071,0,Human immune responses to the highly repetitive Plasmodium falciparum antigen Pf332.,"The B and T cell responses to EB200, a repetitive part of the Plasmodium falciparum antigen Pf332, were examined in malaria-exposed Senegalese adults. Most donors had high levels of antibodies to recombinant EB200 and 17 overlapping peptides spanning EB200. Taking proliferation and/or cytokine (interferon-gamma and interleukin-4) production as a measure of T cell activation, eight of the EB200-derived peptides induced responses in > 40% of the donors tested. There was no general association between the different types of T cell responses measured, emphasizing the importance of including multiple parameters when analyzing T cell responses and suggesting that EB200 induces functionally distinct T cell responses. The most efficient peptide for induction of proliferative responses was one previously shown to induce T cell responses in five different H-2 congenic mouse strains primed with EB200, suggesting that this is a universal T cell epitope. The presence of multiple B and T cell epitopes in EB200, widely recognized by humans, is important since EB200 has been shown to elicit protective antibody responses in monkeys and may be considered for inclusion in malaria subunit vaccines."
CD008122,0,18534600,0,Failure to respond to the surface of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes predicts susceptibility to clinical malaria amongst African children.,"Following infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, children in endemic areas develop antibodies specific to antigens on the parasite-infected red cell surface of the infecting isolate, antibodies associated with protection against subsequent infection with that isolate. In some circumstances induction of antibodies to heterologous parasite isolates also occurs and this has been suggested as evidence for cross-reactivity of responses against the erythrocyte surface. The role of these relatively cross-reactive antibodies in protection from clinical malaria is currently unknown. We studied the incidence of clinical malaria amongst children living on the coast of Kenya through one high transmission season. By categorising individuals according to their pre-season parasite status and antibody response to the surface of erythrocytes infected with four parasite isolates we were able to identify a group of children, those who failed to make a concomitant antibody response in the presence of an asymptomatic parasitaemia, at increased susceptibility to clinical malaria in the subsequent 6 months. The fact that this susceptible group was identified regardless of the parasite isolate tested infers a cross-reactive or conserved target is present on the surface of infected erythrocytes. Identification of this target will significantly aid understanding of naturally acquired immunity to clinical malaria amongst children in endemic areas."
CD008122,0,14978337,0,Comparison of immunological responses to the various types circumsporozoite proteins of Plasmodium vivax in malaria patients of Korea.,"We compared the seroreactivities against four synthetic peptide antigens (VK210, VK247, Korean type 1, and type 2) and a full length recombinant circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antigen of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax ) in samples of sixty-three tertian malaria patients in Korea. Among the various CSP antigens, the full-length recombinant CSP showed the highest reactivity in malaria-exposed groups (85.7%, 54/63). No significant difference was found in the percentage of malaria patients with antibodies among four peptides examined, except a full-length recombinant CSP. Absorbance values from the peptide-based ELISA showed high correlations (r > 0.9, P < 0.05) at significant values. Five sera without the immunoaffinity against peptides were reactive towards the full-length recombinant CSP in ELISA. Sera, which were not reactive to a full length recombinant CSP antigen, were not recognized by any of peptide based ELISA. These data suggested that peptide structures included in Korean isolates, GNGAGGQAA, and VK247 peptides had immune reactivity and recognition epitopes. Among the antigens, GNGAGGQAA was less recognized by patients exposed to Korean strains of P. vivax in comparison to the VK210 structures."
CD008122,0,9635949,0,Low plasma concentrations of interleukin 10 in severe malarial anaemia compared with cerebral and uncomplicated malaria.,"Severe anaemia is a major complication of malaria but little is known about its pathogenesis. Experimental models have implicated tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in induction of bone-marrow suppression and eythrophagocytosis. Conversely, interleukin 10 (IL-10), which mediates feed-back regulation of TNF, stimulates bone-marrow function in vitro and counteracts anaemia in mice. We investigated the associations of these cytokines with malarial anaemia."
CD008122,0,2313570,0,Sensitive radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the simultaneous determination of chloroquine and its metabolites in biological fluids.,"Two new methods for the simultaneous determination of chloroquine and its two main metabolites (monodesethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine) in biological samples, radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are described. Antiserum is produced in rabbits immunized with N-(2-carboxyethyl)desethylchloroquine:protein conjugate. Besides chloroquine, this antiserum recognizes with good affinity the two main metabolites, monodesethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine (70 and 40% of crossreaction, respectively). Amodiaquine cross reacts by 4.5%; cross reactions with monodesethylamodiaquine, bisdesethylamodiaquine, and other antimalarial drugs are less than 1%. No extraction step or sample preparation is required for either system. Sensitivity limits are, respectively, 0.70 nM (3 pg of chloroquine sulfate measured in 10 microL of plasma sample) for RIA, and 10 nM (22 pg of chloroquine sulfate measured in 5 microL of plasma sample) for ELISA. The interassay coefficients of variation are, respectively, less than 10 and less than 16% for RIA and ELISA in the range 14-410 nM (6-180 ng/mL). The results of both methods are well correlated (r = 0.97) and correlate with spectrophotometry (r = 0.98) and HPLC results (r = 0.93). Because of their high sensitivity, both methods can be used in the case of chloroquine poisoning and in the control of malaria prophylaxis and treatment."
CD008122,0,9025691,0,Immunoglobulin G reactivities to rhoptry-associated protein-1 associated with decreased levels of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in Tanzanian children.,"In the Muheza region of Tanzania, an area with holoendemic malaria, the proportion of responders with IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivities to recombinant rhoptry-associated protein-1 (rRAP-1) as well as IgG reactivities to a repeat region of the acidic-basic repeat antigen (ABRA) increased with age. The proportion of responders with IgM reactivities to rRAP-1 increased with age in the first three decades. However, levels of IgG reactivities to rRAP-1 did not increase with age, indicating high levels of reactivities among young children. High P. falciparum densities were only detectable in children less than five years of age; in this group the proportion of IgG responders to rRAP-1 and to the ABRA repeat region was low but levels of IgG reactivities to rRAP-1 were inversely correlated with parasite density, suggesting that immune recognition of the antigen may be associated with resistance to infection. On the other hand, levels of IgG reactivities to the repeat region of ABRA increased with parasite densities in children 1-4 years of age. Two different profiles of IgG reactivities to rRAP-1 and to ABRA are detectable in young Tanzanian children and the Ig reactivities against rRAP-1 may be a component of the immune reactions restricting parasite multiplication."
CD008122,0,17038676,0,Evidence for transmission of Plasmodium vivax among a duffy antigen negative population in Western Kenya.,"We present evidence that a parasite with characteristics of Plasmodium vivax is being transmitted among Duffy blood group-negative inhabitants of Kenya. Thirty-two of 4,901 Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus (0.65%) collected in Nyanza Province were ELISA positive for the P. vivax circumsporozoite protein VK 247. All positives were found late in the rainy season, when An. funestus predominated, and disproportionately many were found at a single village. A P. vivax specific sequence of the SSU rRNA gene was amplified from three of six ELISA-positive mosquitoes. Erythrocytes from 31 children, including 9 microscopically diagnosed as infected with P. vivax, were negative by flow cytometry for the Fy3 or Fy6 epitopes, which indicate Duffy blood group expression. A DNA fragment specific for the C terminus of the gene for P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) was amplified from the blood of four of these children and subsequently sequenced from two."
CD008122,0,17038677,0,Antibodies to Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen 1: persistence and correlation with malaria transmission intensity.,"The antibody responses to the apical membrane antigen 1 of the Plasmodium vivax (PvAMA-1) were investigated in subjects living in areas of Brazil with different levels of malaria transmission. The prevalence and the levels of IgG to PvAMA-1 increased with the time of exposure. The frequency of a positive response and the mean IgG level were higher in areas where malaria prevalence was more intense, especially among non-infected subjects exposed to moderate transmission over a period of 20 years. The proportions and levels of IgG1and IgG3 isotypes were significantly higher among those subjects with long-term exposure. Antibodies, mainly IgG1, to PvAMA-1 persisted for seven years among subjects briefly exposed to malaria in an outbreak outside the Brazilian malaria-endemic area. These data show the highly immunogenic properties of PvAMA-1 and emphasize its possible use as a malaria vaccine candidate."
CD008122,0,18853608,0,Comparison of two commercial assays and microscopy with PCR for diagnosis of malaria.,"This study compared conventional PCR with microscopy and 2 rapid detection methods, the pLDH which detected lactic dehydrogenase enzyme produced by actively metabolizing organisms and the malaria antibody tests. The sensitivity of PCR was 1 parasite/microl, i.e.: 50 times more sensitive than microscopy. When PCR was compared with microscopy, the sensitivity and specificity were 90% & 100% respectively. The sensitivity recorded was pLDH test in comparison to PCR (95%). The malaria antibody test recorded the least sensitivity (68%) PCR proved as the gold standard for evaluation of applied tests and the newly introduced ones. In absence of an expert microscopist, the pLDH test could substitute for microscopy. The test proved valuable to assess clinical cure, and predict drug resistance. Its advantage over microscopy was the ability to diagnose infection with low parasitemic patients. Antibody rapid tests might be not valuable in acute cases, but still accepted as a tool in epidemiological studies and in screening patients in blood banks in malaria endemic areas."
CD008122,0,1341092,0,Prenatal immune hypersensitization to malaria: Plasmodium falciparum-specific IgE antibody in paired maternal and cord sera from Papua New Guinea.,"In a study of malaria and pregnancy in East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea 45 maternal and cord serum pairs were tested for Plasmodium falciparum-specific IgE antibody. There were 17 positive sera: 6 cases of maternal serum alone, 5 cases of cord serum alone and 3 pairs of maternal and cord sera. IgE antibody positivity rates in the mothers increased with parity, whereas placental parasitaemia rates decreased. Cord serum positivity was not affected by parity. Immunoblots of the sera revealed a diversity of IgE antibodies to specific antigens of the P. falciparum lysate, but an IgE antibody to a 48kd antigen was present in all positive maternal and cord sera."
CD008122,0,10456916,0,Isolation of peptides that mimic epitopes on a malarial antigen from random peptide libraries displayed on phage.,"The ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) is a dense-granule protein of Plasmodium falciparum which binds to the cytoskeletal structure of the erythrocyte after parasite invasion. It is currently under trial as a vaccine candidate. In an effort to characterize further the antibody responses to this antigen, we have panned two independent libraries of random peptides expressed on the surface of filamentous phage with a monoclonal antibody (MAb 18/2) against RESA. One library consisted of a potentially constrained 17-mer peptide fused with the gpVIII phage coat protein, and the other displayed an unconstrained 15-mer as a fusion with the minor phage coat protein gpIII. Several rounds of biopanning resulted in enrichment from both libraries clones that interacted specifically with MAb 18/2 in protein-blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments. Nucleotide sequencing of the random oligonucleotide insert revealed a common predominant motif: (S/T)AVDD. Several other clones had related but degenerate motifs. Thus, a monoclonal antibody against a malarial antigen can select common mimotopes from different random peptide libraries. We envisage many uses for this technology in malaria research."
CD008122,0,2432083,0,Detection of human antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites using synthetic peptides.,"A large peptide consisting of about 40 (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro) repeats of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, (NANP)40, was synthesized. It was recognized specifically by monoclonal antibodies produced against P. falciparum sporozoites. Moreover, this peptide strongly inhibited the binding of such monoclonal antibodies to antigens present in a sporozoite extract. The (NANP)40 peptide was employed without any carrier to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect sporozoite-specific serum antibodies arising after natural malaria infections. Antibodies were detected in a high percentage (43.1%) of European patients suffering from acute P. falciparum malaria and in Africans living in an area of Gabon endemic for malaria. In the latter group, the frequency of antisporozoite antibodies increased with age, reaching 65.9% in individuals more than 40 years old. There was a significant correlation between the results obtained with an immunofluorescence assay with glutaraldehyde-fixed sporozoites and those obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with (NANP)40. Therefore, such synthetic peptides representing the repetitive epitope of P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein can be used for the detection of antisporozoite antibodies and for the epidemiological studies required to obtain base-line data concerning the immune status of individuals before their participation in a sporozoite vaccine trial."
CD008122,0,2567370,0,"Rapid, sensitive diagnosis of malaria based on ribosomal RNA.",A system for the sensitive and accurate diagnosis of all four species of malaria parasite that are pathogenic in man has been developed. It involves hybridisation of oligonucleotides complementary to species-specific regions of the RNA of the parasite small ribosomal subunit followed by autoradiography. The method retains its specificity even under conditions of very low stringency similar to those that will occur in field diagnosis. Direct application of treated blood to nylon is possible and consistently results in the detection of fewer than 10 parasites by autoradiography in an overnight exposure. The target rRNA is stable even in dehydrated cells.
CD008122,0,1922106,0,"Characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies against a repetitive synthetic peptide from the circumsporozoite protein of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.","Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were raised in mice against the synthetic peptide (NANP)40, consisting of 40 (NANP) repeats of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, and characterized. (i) Five of these mAbs recognized the P. falciparum CS protein in western blot experiments and in immunofluorescence assays using different preparations of sporozoites. The remaining two mAbs (CT3.2 and CT3.3, both IgG1) gave negative results by both techniques. (ii) When the anti-(NANP)40 peptide mAbs were functionally tested in vitro to assess their ability to inhibit the attachment and penetration of the parasites into cultured human liver cells, six of them exhibited inhibitory activities ranging between 66 and 90%. CT3.2 mAbs, also, inhibited sporozoite attachment and penetration, despite the negative results by immunofluorescence and western blot experiments. However, when immunofluorescence was repeated in the presence of calcium, CT3.2 did reveal a positive recognition of P. falciparum sporozoites, suggesting that this mAb could recognize the (NANP) sequence when calcium was bound to the repetitive peptide. (iii) Furthermore, the binding of an anti-(NANP)40 IgM mAb (CT1) to the solid-phase peptide was not inhibited by preincubation of the peptide with a mAb against the P. falciparum CS protein. (iv) Finally, one anti-(NANP)40 IgG1 mAb (CT3.1) was unable to bind to the shorter (NANP)3 peptide, although it recognized the (NANP)40 peptide and the P. falciparum CS protein. The results presented here suggest that heterogeneous antibody populations are produced upon immunization of mice with (NANP)40 synthetic peptide and that epitopes different from those simply related to the linear (NANP) amino acid sequence are likely to be present in long (NANP)n constructs as well as in the repetitive domain of the P. falciparum CS protein."
CD008122,0,1842063,0,DNA diagnosis of falciparum malaria.,"We have developed DNA diagnosis using Universal probe system for the rapid detection of Plasmodium falciparum parasite in blood. We chose the DHFR-TS (dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase) gene as target for detection which are the junction part (410 bp) of and the DHFR part (790 bp). In the parasite, there is only one copy of target sequence, therefore, the target sequences were amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to increase the sensitivity. Our hybridization method consists of two probes; a primary probe prepared from a chimeric phage-plasmid vector (pUCf1) containing sequence complementary to the target, and a biotin-labeled secondary probe complementary to a portion of the primary probe, which is detected by the BCIP/NBT method. We showed that the 410 bp was more sensitive than the 790 bp as a target of P. falciparum, and the limit of detection was 10(3) parasites in 1 ml human blood using 410 bp junction part. We also constructed double PCR systems using junction part of DHFR-TS gene. By amplification of the 410 bp of the junction part and reamplification of 228 bp of inside sequence of the 410 bp, as little as 10 parasites in 10 microliters human blood was sufficient for specific detection."

Plasma from 77 malaria infected individuals (with malaria parasites) were assayed for TNF by ELISA. The mean age of the subjects under study was 16.36 +/- 0.80 (mean +/- SEM) years. Thirty-nine (51%) subjects had measurable plasma TNF. Taking symptomatology into account, 10 (59%) of the 17 asymptomatics and 29 (48%) of the 60 symptomatics had measurable plasma TNF. A risk ratio of 0.9 was obtained for the association between the detection of plasma TNF and the presence of symptoms. In plasma from 13 healthy controls no TNF was detected. The results suggest that if TNF plays a negative role in the pathogenesis of malaria, it must be in the presence of other predisposing factors."
CD008122,0,1645929,0,Positive response to sodium antimony gluconate administration in visceral leishmaniasis seropositive patients.,"In a prospective study conducted in Mymensingh district of Bangladesh, 1, 273 patients were assessed for the presence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) was successfully administered to 715 patients with parasitologically confirmed infection. In the remaining 558, although there was clinical indication of VL, Leishmania donovani parasites could not be demonstrated. Administration of SAG in this group was on the grounds of the prevailing symptoms, exclusion of malaria and a positive direct agglutination test (DAT). Significant improvements in the clinical and hematological parameters were observed in 547 (98%) of the unconfirmed VL cases. On the basis of the parasitological findings or positive response to specific anti-Leishmania chemotherapy, the sensitivity and specificity of the DAT were 99.6% and 97.7% respectively. The results supported the reliability of DAT for diagnosis of VL at levels below that of parasitological detection."

CD008122,0,8594691,0,A simple method for assessing quinine pre-treatment in acute malaria.,"Administration of a loading dose of quinine in severe malaria may be dangerous if therapeutic blood concentrations are already present because of previous treatment. To assess the reliability of the history of pretreatment we conducted a prospective study of 379 adult patients with acute falciparum malaria admitted to a hospital in western Thailand. Admission plasma concentrations of quinine were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and compared with the patients' history of previous quinine treatment. The sensitivity of the history was 59% (95%) confidence interval [CI] 49-69%), the specificity was 79% (95% CI 74-84%), the positive predictive value was 53%, and the negative predictive value 82%. A rapid (10 min semi-quantitative estimate of plasma quinine concentrations, based on simple 'dipstick' method using a quinine-specific monoclonal antibody, proved considerably more sensitive and specific. The correlation between the dipstick estimate and the subsequent HPLC measurement of plasma quinine concentration was 0.85 (n = 404; P < 0.0001). In 404 admission samples, the negative predictive value of the dipstick estimate for plasma quinine concentrations > 1 microgram/mL was 100%. In Thailand the history of previous quinine treatment given by the patients or their relatives was unreliable but the quinine dipstick provided a simple and rapid means of assessment of quinine pre-treatment in acute falciparum malaria."
CD008122,0,18834523,0,Determinants of the accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests in malaria case management: evidence from low and moderate transmission settings in the East African highlands.,"The accuracy of malaria diagnosis has received renewed interest in recent years due to changes in treatment policies in favour of relatively high-cost artemisinin-based combination therapies. The use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) based on histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) synthesized by Plasmodium falciparum has been widely advocated to save costs and to minimize inappropriate treatment of non-malarial febrile illnesses. HRP2-based RDTs are highly sensitive and stable; however, their specificity is a cause for concern, particularly in areas of intense malaria transmission due to persistence of HRP2 antigens from previous infections."

We have used 2 antigen preparations: crude merozoites and infected erythrocyte ghosts (GRp). High specific antibody responses were found in the villagers' sera, with IgG levels being significantly higher than those directed to the whole P. falciparum schizont Ag preparation; the reverse was found for IgM responses. An imbalanced IgG subclass Ab response was evidenced towards cytophilic IgG1+/gG3+ responses rather than to IgG2+/lgG4+. Mean levels of antibodies increased significantly with age and a strong relationship was evidenced in individual levels of Ab responses towards all the Ag studied. Investigation of the morbidity, recorded as the number of confirmed clinical accesses, underlined a significant inverse relationship only with the levels of IgG to GRp. Taken together, these results proved usefullness of crude P. falciparum Ags for immuno-epidemiological related studies and underlined GRp as a particular target of Ab responses."
CD008122,0,8050178,0,IgE elevation and IgE anti-malarial antibodies in Plasmodium falciparum malaria: association of high IgE levels with cerebral malaria.,"In the course of studying immunoregulation in human Plasmodium falciparum malaria we have investigated IgE levels and IgE anti-plasmodial antibodies in children and adults from areas of high malaria endemicity in both Africa and Asia. On average, 85% of all donors had significantly elevated levels of total IgE. A fraction of the IgE had anti-plasmodial activity as revealed by ELISA with lysates of infected erythrocytes as antigen. Using synthetic peptides representing antigenic regions of two major plasmodial blood stage antigens, IgE antibody concentrations ranged from 5 to 15 ng/ml serum for each of the peptides. On average, the concentrations of the corresponding IgG antibodies were x 500-1000 higher. Immunoblotting of parasite lysates showed that most donors had IgE antibodies against one or several of a restricted number of plasmodial polypeptides, with antibodies against an antigen of mol.wt 45 kD already being present in all donors at an early age. Donors having IgE antibodies to particular antigens also frequently had corresponding IgG4 antibodies, reflecting underlying IL-4-dependent cellular mechanisms controlling formation of these isotypes. As infection with other parasites such as helminths is known to induce IgE elevation, the results do not prove that plasmodial infections were the primary cause of IgE induction. However, the importance of plasmodial infection for IgE elevation was supported by the finding of significantly higher levels of IgE, but not of IgG, in children with cerebral malaria compared with patients with uncomplicated disease."
CD008122,0,2927956,0,An antigen detection enzyme immunoassay for the diagnosis of rhodesiense sleeping sickness.,"A monoclonal antibody raised against a non-variable surface antigen of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense procyclic trypomastigotes was used to develop an antigen detection enzyme immunoassay for the diagnosis of rhodesiense sleeping sickness. The assay was evaluated using 211 sera from clinically suspected cases: 142 from parasitologically proven cases and 69 from patients who were negative on parasitological examination. The test was positive in 128 out of 142 parasitologically proven cases. The negative cases may have been in the early stages of the disease, or may represent patients with antibody levels sufficient to prevent detection of antigen. Of particular significance, however, was the finding that eight of the 69 patients with undiagnosed disease were antigen positive despite the negative parasitological findings. Since false-positive reactions were not observed with blood donor sera, or with sera from malaria, schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis patients, it is reasonable to conclude that the eight antigen-positive patients were actual cases of sleeping sickness. The remaining 61 cases who were negative for both parasitaemia and antigenaemia may conceivably represent the variety of diseases whose clinical manifestations resemble those of rhodesiense sleeping sickness. The antigen detection method would thus not only be complementary to parasitological diagnosis, but essential for correct diagnosis in certain stages of the disease."

CD008122,0,18228564,0,Killer applications: toward affordable rapid cell-based diagnostics for malaria and tuberculosis.,"In many resource-poor areas, the HIV/AIDS epidemic coexists with epidemics of two much older diseases, malaria and tuberculosis, and the three diseases together kill approximately six million people per year. Although HIV/AIDS is treatable, but not curable, many if not most cases of malaria and tuberculosis (TB) can be cured if diagnosed correctly and promptly. The diagnosis of both malaria and TB is cell-based, typically made by microscopy of stained smears of blood (malaria) and sputum (TB). Cytometry has been shown to be effective for diagnosis of both conditions; however, conventional cytometers have been too complex and costly to be widely applied. It is likely that a newly developed small, simple, robust, inexpensive, energy-efficient low-resolution fluorescence image cytometer, employing a light-emitting diode for excitation and a megapixel digital camera chip for detection, could be used in resource-poor areas for malaria and TB diagnosis and for rapid (24-48 h) determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis."

These peptides had high red blood cell binding activity and their carboxy- and amino-terminal extremes were elongated for determining their immunogenic and protection-inducing activity against this disease in the Aotus monkey experimental model. 1H-NMR was used for analysing their three-dimensional structure; FAST ELISA, immunofluorescence antibody test, and Western blot were used for identifying their antibody inducing capacity and these previously immunised Aotus were inoculated with a highly infective P. falciparum strain to determine whether these elongated peptides were able to induce protection. This was aimed at establishing an association or correlation between long peptides' three-dimensional structure and their immunogenic and protection-inducing response in these monkeys. Peptides 20026 (25 residue), 20028 (30 residue), and 20030 (35 residues) were synthesised based on elongating the amino-terminal region of the 10022 highly immunogenic and protection-inducing modified peptide. 1H-NMR studies revealed that the first three had Classical type III beta-turn structures, different from the 20-amino acid long modified peptide 10022 which had a distorted type III beta-turn. Humoral immune response analysis showed that even when some antibodies could be generated against the parasite, none of the immunised Aotus could be protected with elongated peptides suggesting that elongating them eliminated modified peptide 10022 immunogenic and protection-inducing capacity."
CD008122,0,12943979,0,Comparison of adult somatic and cysteine proteinase antigens of Fasciola gigantica in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for serodiagnosis of human fasciolosis.,"Fasciolosis caused by Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica is one of the major public health problems in the world and in Iran. Considering that stool examination for Fasciola eggs is not a sensitive method and immunodiagnosis methods are more applicable for this purpose, so the present study was conducted to compare the somatic (S) and cysteine proteinase (CP) antigens of F. gigantica in IgG-ELISA to diagnose human fasciolosis. Serum samples obtained from 100 individuals collected during the fasciolosis outbreak in 1999 in the Gilan province of Northern Iran that were coprologically positive for fasciolosis were analyzed by IgG-ELISA. Sera from healthy control individuals, not infected with any parasitic diseases (n=50) and from others with different parasitic infections including hydatidosis (n=40), toxocariosis (n=20), amoebiosis (n=10), and malaria (n=5) were examined as well. The cut-off point for (S) and CP was 0.40 and 0.35, respectively. All 100 individuals that showed clinical manifestations of fasciolosis, were also seropositive using both antigens, whereas all 50 non-infected controls were seronegative, therefore the sensitivity of the test was 100% for both antigens. The specificity of (S) and CP antigens were calculated as 96.9 and 98.4%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the test regarding (S) antigen were 96 and 100%, whereas these values as for CP antigen were 98 and 100% correspondingly. Two individuals with hydatidosis and two with toxocariasis had antibodies that were reactive against (S) antigen, whereas concerning CP antigen, one individual with hydatidosis and another with toxocariasis showed cross-reactivity against it. We have demonstrated that altogether CP antigen provides a more conclusive diagnosis as possessing lower cut-off and enabling better to discriminate between seronegative and seropositive subpopulations."
CD008122,0,10212896,0,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of qinghaosu derivatives: how do they impact on the choice of drug and the dosage regimens?,"The critical decisions of which artemisinin derivative(s) to use and by which route(s) of administration for falciparum malaria are complex scientifically and politically. Despite the need for additional pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicokinetic data, these drugs are too important to delay concise, rational recommendations any longer. These types of decisions must be made now, implemented on a multinational level with WHO leadership, and revised as new findings emerge. For acute, uncomplicated disease, per os dosing of artesunate or artemether for three days is recommended, but only in combination with other antimalarial drugs like mefloquine. For severe falciparum malaria, intravenous administration is the preferred route, yet current formulations for intravenous dosing are not optimal and should be an area for future development emphasis. Clearly intramuscular administration of artemether has proven effective for severe disease, yet dosing regimens shouldn't be designed with ultimate parasitological cure as the aim and the problem of bioavailability of the sesame oil formulations must be examined further. Once the life-saving reduction in parasitemia and pathophysiological sequelae have been achieved, the patient can be given oral medication to affect radical cure. Much more data will be required to define the role of per rectum dosing for the treatment of severe malaria, yet this approach holds great promise as a life-saving intervention in rural areas where this disease has it most dramatic impact."
CD008122,0,3208546,0,Pharmacokinetics of chlorproguanil in man after a single oral dose of Lapudrine.,"The pharmacokinetic parameters of chlorproguanil (Lapudrine) and its active metabolite, chlorcycloguanil, were determined in 6 healthy male volunteers after a single oral dose of 4 Lapudrine tables (80 mg). The mean maximum plasma chlorproguanil concentration was 36.7 +/- (SD) 7.9 ng/ml and was reached at 3.8 +/- 1.3 h. The chlorproguanil elimination half-life was 17.5 +/- 6.7 h and its plasma clearance was 1.28 +/- 0.12 l/h/kg. The mean whole blood to plasma ratio was 3.1 at 4 h after dosing. Chlorcycloguanil could not be quantified in plasma and whole blood at the detection limit of 10 ng/ml using a high-performance liquid chromatographic method. An excretion rate-time plot from urine data shows a rapid (t1/2 = 20 h) and a slow phase (t1/2 = 51 h) in the elimination of chlorcycloguanil. Our findings suggest that the current prophylactic regimen of chlorproguanil hydrochloride (20 mg weekly) may not be optimal in preventing infections with chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria."
CD008122,0,12943972,0,Humoral responses to defined malaria antigens in children living since birth under insecticide treated curtains in Burkina Faso.,"Insecticide treated materials (ITM) are considered a useful malaria control measure for endemic countries, but whether they also delay the acquisition of immunity to malaria remains unclear. This study investigates plasma antibody levels in 160 children aged 3-6 years from five villages protected by insecticide treated curtains (ITC) over 6 years and in 184 children of the same age group from five villages in the same area never covered by ITC. The antigens to which antibodies were investigated were: the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) repetitive sequence (NANP)5; the C-terminal domain of the P. falciparum exported protein 1 (Cter-PfExp1); three fragments of the glutamate rich protein (GLURP), referred to as R0, R1 and R2; the merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3). The level of antibodies was lower in children from the ITC area than in children from the non-ITC area for (NANP)5, R0, R2 and MSP3. Prevalence and intensity of P. falciparum infection were similar in the two groups of children. These findings suggest that reducing the level of malaria transmission over a long period may affect the level of antibodies in children to both sporozoite and blood stage malaria antigens."
CD008122,0,3069703,0,Naturally-occurring anti-alpha-galactosyl antibodies in human Plasmodium falciparum infections--a possible role for autoantibodies in malaria.,"Naturally-occurring antibodies with a distinct alpha-galactosyl specificity (anti-gal) have been earlier implicated in opsonization and elimination of human senescent erythrocytes from circulation. In the present study a cell-ELISA was developed for quantification of anti-gal antibodies in human sera. Using the test, titres of anti-gal were found to be significantly elevated in many of the sera collected from subjects living in malaria endemic areas or patients with acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria, in comparison to the titres in subjects living in areas where the incidence of P. falciparum malaria was scarce. IgG subclass typing by cell-ELISA revealed IgG3 to be the predominant type with anti-gal activity in P. falciparum infected patients' serum while IgG2 was found to be dominant in the non-endemic control serum. These findings appear to have implications in P. falciparum malaria, since putative antigens with alpha-galactosyl determinants have been identified in the erythrocytic stage parasites of P. falciparum."
CD008122,0,14738458,0,"Cellular immunity induced by the recombinant Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS02, in semi-immune adults in The Gambia.","Vaccination of malaria-naive humans with recombinant RTS,S/AS02, which includes the C-terminus of the circumsporozoite protein (CS), has been shown to induce strong T cell responses to both the whole protein antigen and to peptides from CS. Here we show that strong T cell responses were also observed in a semi-immune population in The Gambia, West Africa. In a Phase I study, 20 adult male volunteers, lifelong residents in a malaria-endemic region, were given three doses of RTS,S/AS02 at 0, 1 and 6 months. Responses to RTS,S, hepatitis B surface antigen and peptides from CS were tested using lymphocyte proliferation, interferon (IFN)-gamma production in microcultures, and IFN-gamma ex vivo and cultured ELISPOT, before and after vaccination. Cytotoxic responses were tested only after vaccination and none were detected. Before vaccination, the majority of the volunteers (15/20) had detectable responses in at least one of the tests. After vaccination, responses increased in all assays except cytotoxicity. The increase was most marked for proliferation; all donors responded to RTS,S after the third dose and all except one donor responded to at least one peptide after the second or third dose. There was a lack of close association of peptide responses detected by the different assays, although in microcultures IFN-gamma responses were found only when proliferative responses were high, and responses by cultured ELISPOT and proliferation were found together more frequently after vaccination. We have therefore identified several peptide-specific T cell responses induced by RTS,S/AS02 which provides a mechanism to investigate potentially protective immune responses in the field."
CD008122,0,19032767,0,The content of African diets is adequate to achieve optimal efficacy with fixed-dose artemether-lumefantrine: a review of the evidence.,"A fixed-dose combination of artemether-lumefantrine (AL, Coartem(R)) has shown high efficacy, good tolerability and cost-effectiveness in adults and children with uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Lumefantrine bioavailability is enhanced by food, particularly fat.As the fat content of sub-Saharan African meals is approximately a third that of Western countries, it raises the question of whether fat consumption by African patients is sufficient for good efficacy. Data from healthy volunteers have indicated that drinking 36 mL soya milk (containing only 1.2 g of fat) results in 90% of the lumefantrine absorption obtained with 500 mL milk (16 g fat). African diets are typically based on a carbohydrate staple (starchy root vegetables, fruit [plantain] or cereals) supplemented by soups, relishes and sauces derived from vegetables, pulses, nuts or fish. The most important sources of dietary fat in African countries are oil crops (e.g. peanuts, soya beans) and cooking oils as red palm, peanut, coconut and sesame oils. Total fat intake in the majority of subSaharan countries is estimated to be in the range 30-60 g/person/day across the whole population (average 43 g/person/day). Breast-feeding of infants up to two years of age is standard, with one study estimating a fat intake of 15-30 g fat/day from breast milk up to the age of 18 months. Weaning foods typically contain low levels of fat, and the transition from breast milk to complete weaning is associated with a marked reduction in dietary fat. Nevertheless, fat intake >10 g/day has been reported in young children post-weaning. A randomized trial in Uganda reported no difference in the efficacy of AL between patients receiving supervised meals with a fixed fat content (~23 g fat) or taking AL unsupervised, suggesting that fat intake at home was sufficient for optimal efficacy. Moreover, randomized trials in African children aged 5-59 months have shown similar high cure rates to those observed in older populations, indicating that food consumption is adequate post-weaning. In conclusion, it appears that only a very small amount of dietary fat is necessary to ensure optimal efficacy with AL and that the fat content of standard meals or breast milk in sub-Saharan Africa is adequate."
CD008122,0,9264740,0,[In vivo drug sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum in the Tabou region of Ivory Coast].,"Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is one of the major health problems in West-Africa, mainly affecting young children. This situation is further complicated by the emergence and rapid progression of resistance to chloroquine, the recommended first line treatment. In order to document the level of resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine, pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (Fansidar) and quinine, we performed a survey in Tabou district, Côre d'Ivoire, from June to August 1995. This area has been hosting some 100,000 Liberian refugees since September 1994. Children aged 1 to 15 years old attending the dispensary with a complain of fever or suspected malaria, were included into the study, diagnosed and followed for 7 days according to the WHO Standard Field (in vivo) Tests. Overall proportion of P. falciparum resistant to chloroquine reached 45.1% and was made of 34.3% type II and 10.8% type III resistance. Being less than 5 years of age and having received a lower dose of drug were 2 factors associated with the risk of resistance to chloroquine. Levels of R II resistance to pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine and quinine (3-day treatment) were respectively 5.4% and 4.2%. No R III resistance was found in neither pyrimethaminelsulfadoxine or quinine treatment groups. These results challenge the current chloroquine-based first line malaria treatment in Côre d'Ivoire. Alternative based on pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine could be considered, especially in high risk populations during transient situation (refugees). However, elaborating new treatment policy must take into consideration cost, side-effects, compliance and acceptability. Further studies are needed to evaluate the cost-benefit of alternative strategies."
CD008122,0,19556562,0,Comparative study of serologic tests for the diagnosis of asymptomatic visceral leishmaniasis in an endemic area.,"Serologic tests have been widely used for the diagnosis of asymptomatic visceral leishmaniasis. This study evaluated five serologic tests used for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infection: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using promastigote antigen (ELISAp), ELISA using recombinant K39 (ELISA rK39), and K26 (ELISA rK26) antigens, an indirect immunofluorescence test using Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis promastigote antigen (IIFT), and an immunochromatographic test using rK39 antigen (TRALd). As a reference regarding the performance of the tests, patients with classic visceral leishmaniasis originating from Minas Gerais, Brazil (N = 36), were defined as the positive group and samples of healthy individuals from nonendemic areas (Argentina) (N = 127) were used as negative controls. Patients with other diseases such as cutaneous leishmaniasis (N = 53) and malaria (N = 56) were also studied to evaluate the chance of cross-reactivity in these tests. Finally, subjects from an area endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil (Porteirinha, northern Minas Gerais) (N = 1241) were screened for asymptomatic infection with Leishmania and Chagas disease. The sensitivity of the serologic tests was 50% (18/36), 66.7% (24/36), 69.4% (25/36), 83.3% (30/36), and 88.9% (32/36) for ELISAp, ELISA rK26, ELISA rK39, IIFT, and TRALd, respectively. Specificity, calculated using the truly negative group, was 96% (122/127) for TRALd, 97.6% (124/127) for ELISAp and IIFT, and 100% (127/127) for ELISA rK39 and rK26. Positivity in at least one test employing recombinant antigen was observed in 24 (45%) patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and 47 (82.4%) with malaria. In the visceral leishmaniasis-endemic area, the positivity of the serologic tests ranged from 3.9% to 37.5%. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests using recombinant antigens were more frequently positive in subjects with a history of exposure to human or canine visceral leishmaniasis (ELISArK39: 14.6% [149/1017] versus 37.5% [84/224]; ELISA rK26: 12.7% [129/1017] versus 21.4% [48/224], P < 0.001 for both). Kappa agreement was low, with a maximum value of 0.449 between ELISAp and IIFT. In addition, among the 112 IIFT-positive subjects, 75 (67%) also presented positive serology for Chagas disease. In conclusion, IIFT and TRALd presented the best performance to diagnose classic cases of visceral leishmaniasis in an endemic area. Cross-reactivity of the tests with Chagas disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and malaria should be taken into account. However, the differences in the positivity of the tests used, together with the low agreement between results, do not permit to select the best test for the diagnosis of asymptomatic Leishmania infection."
CD008122,0,11755428,1,Performance appraisal of rapid on-site malaria diagnosis (ICT malaria Pf/Pv test) in relation to human resources at village level in Myanmar.,"Logistic, economic and technical factors limit rapid access to microscopic confirmation of symptomatic diagnosis of malaria in many rural areas in endemic countries such as Myanmar. A study was conducted to evaluate a rapid on-site immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria Pf/Pv) for detection of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax in two villages in the Taikkyi region of Myanmar. The ICT Malaria tests were performed by a volunteer health worker (VHW) in Yae-Aye-San village and by a professionally trained midwife (MW) in Kankone village. A total of 1000 symptomatic patients participated in the study by providing blood samples for an ICT test and for microscopy. The ICT performance indices, relative to microscopy, were better for the trained MW compared with the less experienced VHW. For P. falciparum and/or P. vivax infections, the sensitivities were 82.7% for the VHW compared with 93.7% for the MW. For P. falciparum infections, the sensitivities were 82.2% for the VHW and 91.3% for the MW, while the corresponding values for P. vivax infections were 66.7 and 79%, respectively. Although the test kit appeared to perform better in more experienced hands, this study questions whether this difference is related to the use of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test kit, or related to other factors such as differences in the quality of blood slides prepared by the VHW and MW for microscopic examination. Overall, the results suggest that a rapid diagnostic assay such as the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test kit can be used in rural settings by relatively inexperienced persons, such as VHWs, with a reasonable degree of sensitivity, thus providing on-site confirmation of symptomatic diagnosis of malaria."
CD008122,0,9557953,0,Antibody reactivity to conserved linear epitopes of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1).,"The Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family of protein antigens are involved in adhesion of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes to the capillary endothelium of the host. Antibodies to variable regions of these proteins, measured by agglutination, correlates with clinical protection against falciparum malaria. In this study we investigated the occurrence of antibodies to conserved sequences of these very variable proteins in a population living in an area endemic for falciparum malaria. Using the ELISA method, we were able to measure an antibody response to three synthetic peptides derived from conserved regions of PfEMP1. The antibody responses to these peptides increased with age and were higher in individuals with asymptomatic P. falciparum infection compared to individuals presenting with fever attributable to falciparum malaria. This indicates that antibodies recognising the conserved regions of PfEMP1 arise upon exposure to the parasite, and that these may be involved in the development of protection against malaria. Antibodies to the Pfalhesin peptide of the human aniontransporter, band3, were measured by the same method. The magnitude of this antibody response did not correlate with neither age nor clinical protection."

The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of the project according to the opinions of the villagers. We conducted a KAP survey of a simple random sample of 300 householders on each island. The conclusion of the study was that the project reduced malaria incidence significantly on Lombok. However, the effects were not as clear on Sumbawa. Poor socio-economic status and lack of school education were important related factors. Therefore, health education, or behavioral change communication, was an essential component of malaria control."
CD008122,0,12932095,0,Storage duration and polymerase chain reaction detection of Plasmodium falciparum from blood spots on filter paper.,"To evaluate the effect of long-term storage of sample filters on the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of malaria, 252 blood spots from patients with microscopically confirmed Plasmodium falciparum malaria were analyzed and stratified by storage duration. The spots were collected between 1996 and 2000 on filter paper and stored at room temperature. A Chelex-based method was used to extract the DNA. Unexpectedly, after the first purification, the sensitivity of the PCR from recently stored samples was low and showed progressively increased with time storage (P = 0.003, by chi-square test for linear trend). This suggested that PCR inhibitors were easier to dissolve from the more recent blood spots (< 4 years old) than from blood spots > or = 4 years old, thus leading to a time-dependent increase in PCR sensitivity. However, if DNA was purified again (when the first PCR result was negative), the cumulative sensitivity was not influenced by storage duration. This indicated that length of storage is not a critical issue providing purification is sufficient."
CD008122,0,12932092,1,Rapid diagnostic devices for malaria: field evaluation of a new prototype immunochromatographic assay for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and non-falciparum Plasmodium.,"The NOW ICT Malaria P.f./P.v. for Whole Blood (Binax, Inc., Portland, ME) is a new malaria rapid diagnostic device that represents a technical advance over previous assays, such as ICT Malaria P.f./P.v. and ICT Malaria P.f.. We evaluated this device in March 2001 in symptomatic patients at malaria clinics in Maesod, Thailand. Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears was the reference standard. In 246 patients, microscopy showed 32 (13.0%) infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 63 (25.6%) with P. vivax, 6 (2.4%) with mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax, 5 (2.0%) with P. malariae, and 140 (56.9%) negative. Sensitivity for P. falciparum was 100% and specificity was 96.2% (200 of 208; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 92-98). For P. vivax, sensitivity was 87.3% (55 of 63; 95% CI = 77-93) and specificity was 97.7% (173 of 177; 95% CI = 95-99), but all the four false-positive results were microscopically positive for P. malariae; thus, specificity for non-falciparum Plasmodium was 100%. These results suggest improved performance over NOW ICT predecessors."

CD008122,0,1988510,0,Antibodies to human T lymphotropic virus type I in a population from the Philippines: evidence for cross-reactivity with Plasmodium falciparum.,"Residents of two areas in the Philippines were tested for human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I): Napsan, a site endemic for malaria, and a nonmalarious site, Bacolod. By ELISA, 30% of the 1743 Napsan residents were positive. Western blot immunoreactivity with two or more HTLV-I proteins was present in 81% of the ELISA positives; however, there was no reactivity with the env proteins. The frequency of this indeterminate immunoreactivity increased with the malaria antibody titer. None of the 200 Bacolod sera were Western blot immunoreactive. In competitive serologic assays, an HTLV-I lysate blocked the HTLV-I immunoreactivity of the Napsan sera but did not reduce malaria antibody. A Plasmodium falciparum lysate blocked both the HTLV-I and malaria immunoreactivity of the Napsan sera. These results show that indeterminate HTLV-I immunoreactivity can be caused by P. falciparum antibody. Serosurveys conducted in malaria endemic areas should consider this possibility."
CD008122,0,12041541,0,IgE elevation and anti-plasmodium falciparum IgE antibodies: association of high level with malaria resistance.,"The total IgE and anti-Plasmodium falciparum IgE antibodies were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 480 children and adults living in malaria endemic area along Thai-Myanmar border, Kanchanaburi Province, western Thailand. Approximately 73.13% of tested individuals had elevated levels of total IgE with a range of 160-998 ng/ml. 20.5% of these IgE were specific to P falciparum blood stage antigens, with a range of 78-353 microg/ml. However, the levels of total IgE were not significantly correlated with those of specific IgE (r = 0.083). The elevation of anti-P falciparum IgE antibodies seems to be age dependent. The prolonged or repeated exposure to malaria parasites is necessary for the induction of specific IgE response as indicated by the finding of a significant correlation between the levels of P falciparum specific IgE and the number of malaria attacks (r = 0.551, p = 0.01). Interestingly, among the specific IgE responders, 20 individuals naturally exposed to malaria but without clinical malaria reported had high levels of both total IgE and anti- P. falciparum IgE antibodies, with mean values of 418.67 mg/ml and 146.25 ng/ml, respectively. It is likely that the antibodies from such specific IgE responders could mediate phagocytosis in vitro."

A total of 60 sera was used in this study. Of these, 10 each were from patients with parastrongyliasis filariasis, gnathostomiasis, malaria and toxocariasis. The control group consisted of 53 serum samples from normal healthy Thais and Malaysians. The mean +/- optical density (OD) values for the normal Thai and Malaysian groups were 0.126 +/- 0.028 and 0.124 +/- 0.029, respectively. Mean OD values of parastrongyliasis patient group differed significantly from that of the normal groups as well as those of other parasitic infections. Using a cut-off point of mean OD +/- 3SD of the normal control groups as indicating a positive reading, the specificity of the assay with this monoclonal antibody was 100% while the sensitivity was 50%."

From September 1989 to March 1990, 2, 499 An. mascarensis specimens from different regions of Madagascar were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using monoclonal antibodies against the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the four human species of Plasmodium. The salivary glands of 237 specimens were also dissected. Fourteen of 1,864 specimens obtained from Sainte Marie island on the Malagasy east coast were found by ELISA to be positive for the CS protein of P. falciparum. In addition, two of 237 specimens that were dissected were observed to have sporozoites in the salivary glands. These sporozoites were identified as P. falciparum by ELISA. In the other regions studied, no positive specimens were found. Due to observed behavioral differences between east coast and highland populations of An. mascarensis, the possible presence of a species complex is discussed."

CD008122,0,11730846,0,Assessment of positivity in immuno-assays with variability in background measurements: a new approach applied to the antibody response to Plasmodium falciparum MSP2.,"Measurements of immune responses often exhibit considerable heterogeneity, making it impossible to clearly distinguish responders and nonresponders to particular antigens. Typically, in, for example, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures, a nonexposed control group is used to assign a cutoff value of positivity, calculated as the mean plus either 2 or 3 standard deviations (S.D.). This can cause extremely biased estimates of response rates when the background is variable, and especially when there is overlap between the distribution of the control levels and that of responders. This problem is compounded when results of assays with different background levels are compared. We illustrate this with hypothetical data sets reflecting frequent patterns seen in laboratory and epidemiological studies. We propose that such data should be analysed by statistical modelling of the ratio of numbers of test samples/control samples as a function of the readout from the assay. Rather than classifying samples dichotomously as negative or positive, this provides estimates of the prevalence of positivity lambda, and the probability, for each sample, that the measured activity is above background. Several statistical methods can provide such estimates. Analyses of simulated data sets using our preferred estimation method [a latent class model (LCM)] demonstrate that this gives more reliable results than the traditional assignment using cutoff values. We have applied this approach to the analysis of ELISA assessments of antibodies against distinct regions of the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) in human sera from Tanzania."

There is, however, scant comparative information about the use of bloodspot eluates for detection of malarial IgG antibodies simultaneously by IFAT and enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). Here we report data obtained by both serological methods done on 219 bloodspot eluate samples collected in a rural community in Brazilian Amazon Basin (Alto Paraíso, Ariquemes municipality) where malaria is endemic. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax thick smear antigens were used in the IFAT; a detergent-soluble P. falciparum antigen was prepared for ELISA. Substantial agreement of results (Kappa coefficient k = 0.686) was observed when P. falciparum antigen was used in both tests, and IFAT titers were found to be strongly correlated to ELISA antibody units (Spearman correlation coefficient rs = 0.818, p < 0.001). Only moderate agreement (k = 0.467) between IFAT with P. vivax antigen and ELISA with P. falciparum antigen was observed. Spearman correlation coefficient value between quantitative results (IFAT titers and ELISA antibody units) in this case was numerically lower (rs = 0.540, p < 0.0001). Our results suggest that, with P. falciparum antigen, both IFAT and ELISA performed on bloodspot eluates are equivalent for seroepidemiological purposes."
CD008122,0,17568939,0,Comparative recognition by human IgG antibodies of recombinant proteins representing three asexual erythrocytic stage vaccine candidates of Plasmodium vivax.,"In previous immuno-epidemiological studies of the naturally acquired antibody responses to merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium vivax, we had evidence that the responses to distinct erythrocytic stage antigens could be differentially regulated. The present study was designed to compare the antibody response to three asexual erythrocytic stage antigens vaccine candidates of P. vivax. Recombinant proteins representing the 19 kDa C-terminal region of MSP-1(PvMSP19), apical membrane antigen n-1 ectodomain (PvAMA-1), and the region II of duffy binding protein (PvDBP-RII) were compared in their ability to bind to IgG antibodies of serum samples collected from 220 individuals from the state of Pará, in the North of Brazil. During patent infection with P. vivax, the frequency of individuals with IgG antibodies to PvMSP1(19), PvAMA-1, and PvDBP-RII were 95, 72.7, and 44.5% respectively. Although the frequency of responders to PvDBP-RII was lower, this frequency increased in individuals following multiple malarial infections. Individually, the specific antibody levels did not decline significantly nine months after treatment, except to PvMSP1(19). Our results further confirm a complex regulation of the immune response to distinct blood stage antigens. The reason for that is presently unknown but it may contribute to the high risk of re-infection in individuals living in the endemic areas."
CD008122,0,10583325,1,Diagnosis of malaria: a review of alternatives to conventional microscopy.,"Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, including countries with mainly imported malaria. In developing nations, scarce resources lead to inadequate diagnostic procedures. In affluent countries, poor familiarity with malaria may cause clinical and laboratory misdiagnosis. Microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin films remains the current standard for diagnosis. Although it has good sensitivity and allows species identification and parasite counts, it is time consuming, requires microscopical expertise and maintenance of equipment. Microscopy with fluorescent stains (QBC), dipstick antigen detection of HRP2 and pLDH (Parasight-F, ICT Malaria Pf, OptiMAL), polymerase chain reaction assays and some automated blood cell analysers offer new approaches and are reviewed here, with emphasis on clinical relevance and their potential to complement conventional microscopy, especially in countries with imported malaria."
CD008122,0,11781267,1,Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria parasites.,"Malaria presents a diagnostic challenge to laboratories in most countries. Endemic malaria, population movements, and travelers all contribute to presenting the laboratory with diagnostic problems for which it may have little expertise available. Drug resistance and genetic variation has altered many accepted morphological appearances of malaria species, and new technology has given an opportunity to review available procedures. Concurrently the World Health Organization has opened a dialogue with scientists, clinicians, and manufacturers on the realistic possibilities for developing accurate, sensitive, and cost-effective rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, capable of detecting 100 parasites/microl from all species and with a semiquantitative measurement for monitoring successful drug treatment. New technology has to be compared with an accepted ""gold standard"" that makes comparisons of sensitivity and specificity between different methods. The majority of malaria is found in countries where cost-effectiveness is an important factor and ease of performance and training is a major consideration. Most new technology for malaria diagnosis incorporates immunochromatographic capture procedures, with conjugated monoclonal antibodies providing the indicator of infection. Preferred targeted antigens are those which are abundant in all asexual and sexual stages of the parasite and are currently centered on detection of HRP-2 from Plasmodium falciparum and parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase or Plasmodium aldolase from the parasite glycolytic pathway found in all species. Clinical studies allow effective comparisons between different formats, and the reality of nonmicroscopic diagnoses of malaria is considered."
CD008122,0,7800407,0,Continuous cultivation of intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum in a serum-free medium with the use of a growth-promoting factor.,"Serum-free media were used to culture Plasmodium falciparum. A commercial preparation, Daigo's GF21 developed as a growth-promoting factor for many kinds of mammalian cells, and consisting of the 55-70% ammonium sulphate fraction of adult bovine serum, insulin, transferrin, ethanolamine and sodium selenite, was found to sustain growth of the parasite when Daigo's T was employed as a basal medium. The optimal Daigo's GF21 concentration for parasite growth was between 5 and 20% (v/v), with the best results at 10%. Differential counts indicated that Daigo's GF21 is essential for schizogony. Established serum-free medium, GIT, consisting of Daigo's T basal medium and Daigo's GF21, yielded good parasite growth without any supplementation. Growth-promoting factor derived from adult bovine serum in Daigo's GF21 was shown to be crucial to parasite growth. The results presented here will not only be of practical value, but will provide important information about the developmental requirements for the parasite."
CD008122,0,12174773,1,Field and laboratory comparative evaluation of ten rapid malaria diagnostic tests.,"The paper reports on a comparative evaluation of 10 rapid malaria tests available in South Africa in 1998: AccuCheck (AC, developmental), Cape Biotech (CB), ICT Malaria Pf (ICT1) and Pf/Pv (ICT2), Kat Medical (KAT), MakroMal (MM), OptiMAL (OP), ParaSight-F (PS), Quorum (Q), Determine-Malaria (DM). In a laboratory study, designed to test absolute detection limits, Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood was diluted with uninfected blood to known parasite concentrations ranging from 500 to 0.1 parasites per microlitre (P/microL). The 50% detection limits were: ICT1, 3.28; ICT2, 4.86; KAT, 6.36; MM, 9.37; CB, 11.42; DM, 12.40; Q, 16.98; PS, 20; AC, 31.15 and OP, 91.16 P/microL. A field study was carried out to test post-treatment specificity. Blood samples from malaria patients were tested with all products (except AC and DM) on the day of treatment and 3 and 7 days thereafter, against a gold standard of microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). OP and PS produced fewer false-positive results on day 7 (18 and 19%, respectively) than the other rapid tests (38-56%). However, microscopy, PCR, OP and PS disagreed largely as to which individuals remained positive. The tests were further compared with regard to general specificity, particularly cross-reactivity with rheumatoid factor, speed, simplicity, their ability to detect other species, storage requirements and general presentation."

A total of 742 patients attending the out-patient department of Mbarara Hospital with a clinical suspicion of malaria were included in the study. For each patient, a thick/thin film and 5 rapid tests based on the detection of histidine-rich protein II (HRP-II) (Paracheck Pf dipstick and device, ParaHIT f, Malaria Rapid and BIO P.F.) were performed. Outcomes were validity, inter-reader reliability and 'ease of use in the field', measured by both the general characteristics of the test and by the opinion of the readers. About half (57%) of the patients were positive for P. falciparum. The Paracheck Pf (dipstick and device) was considered as the most appropriate for the use in the field, being sensitive (97%), moderately specific (88%), reliable (kappa coefficient = 0.97), easy to use and cheap (about US$ 0.5/test). The ParaHIT f represented a good alternative."
CD008122,0,11738704,0,Bioinformatics and the malaria genome: facilitating access and exploitation of sequence information.,"The torrent of sequence information unleashed by the various genome sequencing projects, including that of Plasmodium falciparum, will lead to an unprecedented increase in the data available for research purposes. The scientific community is struggling to develop ways to assimilate this information and ensure that it is fully analysed in a way that enables rapid development of new therapeutic and diagnostic advances. This is particularly so for the field of tropical medicine where many of the scientists have had limited training in the area of Bioinformatics and may be further hampered by poor access to the sequence data. A number of collections of malaria genome sequence are available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, however further improvements in these information resources are needed. In particular, there would be great benefit in integrating genomic sequence and functional genomics results with the large amount of pre-existing knowledge related to parasite biology and immunological interactions with the host. Attempts to achieve this include the PlasmoDB database, and the lessons learned in this effort could be of great utility to other organism-specific databases."
CD008122,0,18214088,0,Rate of British psychiatric combat casualties compared to recent American wars.,"This paper examines factors leading to the low rate of combat psychiatric casualties in the British recapture of the Falklands compared to the American experience in North Africa, Italy, Europe and South Pacific theatres during World War II, the Korean Conflict and Vietnam. The factors compared are those thought to affect rates seen in these past wars. The factors highlighted are psychiatric screening of evacuees, presence of psychiatric personnel in line units, intensity of combat and use of elite units. Factors also mentioned are presence of possible occult psychiatric casualties such as frostbite and malaria, amount of indirect fire and the offensive or defensive nature of the combat. A unique aspect of the Falklands War examined is the exclusive use of hospital ships to treat psychiatric casualties and the impact of the Geneva Convention rules regarding hospital ships on the classic treatment principles of proximity and expectancy. The types and numbers of various diagnoses are also presented. The British Campaign in the Falklands produced a remarkably low rate of psychiatric casualties. When viewed in light of American experience in recent wars, this low rate represents a concentration of optimal factors leading to healthy function in combat. The results of this war should not be used to predict a similar outcome in future combat as this particular constellation of factors may not recur."

Later, the same smears were examined by an experience microscopist in ideal laboratory conditions. Reliability was measured by the Kappa index. In symptomatic malaria patients the Kappa index was 0.91 (IC 95% 0.57-0.98 p<0.05) while in asymptomatic Plasmodium infection the Kappa index was as low as 0.42 (IC 95% 0.15-0.68 p<0.05). In areas of asymptomatic infection, improvement in the sensibility of thick smears by increasing the number of microscopic fields read or using other more accurate diagnostic malaria techniques alone or in combination is fundamental."
CD008122,0,16916494,0,Evidence for undetected malaria infection in non-immune Australian travellers not taking chemoprophylaxis.,"To determine whether travellers from malaria-free countries can develop unrecognised or asymptomatic malaria after visiting endemic areas, we analysed data from 751 prospective blood donors who had visited or resided in malaria-risk areas in the previous 3 years. Malarial antibodies were measured using an established commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay incorporating four recombinant blood-stage plasmodial antigens and with published sensitivity > or =83% and specificity 100%. Details of countries visited and antimalarial chemoprophylaxis used were obtained by questionnaire. Among the 606 subjects resident in malaria-free countries and with no past history of malaria, 176 had visited high-risk countries as categorised by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Of these, 89 took no chemoprophylaxis including 6 (6.7%) who were antibody-positive; there were no antibody-positive subjects in the 87 who took chemoprophylaxis (P=0.029), which was that recommended by WHO in 84% of cases. These data underscore the value of effective antimalarial prophylaxis in non-immune travellers visiting high malaria-risk areas but also suggest that unrecognised infections can occur in those unprotected by chemoprophylaxis."
CD008122,0,1491313,0,"On-site diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae by using the Quantitative Buffy Coat system.","The Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) system was used for the detection and identification of malaria parasites in blood specimens from 570 residents of Oksibil, an isolated highland valley in the eastern Jayawijaya Mountains of Irian Jaya (Indonesian New Guinea). The availability of a battery-powered centrifuge and a fiberoptic Paralens enabled us to complete and interpret the assay in this remote environment. Of 322 QBC tubes examined for 2-4 min each, results of 295 (92%) concurred with findings on the matched Giemsa-stained thick smear (GTS). The 27 discrepant results included 13 QBC+/GTS- that, upon reexamination, were found to be GTS+. When using the corrected GTS results as the standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the QBC were 94% and 96%, respectively. Because electricity was available only 3 hr per day, it was decided to decrease the examination for an additional 248 QBC to a maximum of 90 sec per tube. This shortened inspection time resulted in a reduction of sensitivity to 53% but specificity was preserved at 89%. Forty-two of 45 conflicting results, QBC-/GTS+ from cases of light Plasmodium falciparum infections with < 1 trophozoite or gametocyte per field, were resolved by reexamination of the QBC in the laboratory. Tubes held at 4 C could be reexamined, without noticeable loss of fluorescence, for at least 6 wk after collection. Despite some difficulty in the identification of Plasmodium species, it was concluded that the QBC is an easy, sensitive method for the rapid diagnosis of malaria in the field and that it provides the inexperienced microscopist with an additional means for on-site identification of individuals needing treatment."

CD008122,0,7992345,0,Towards optimal regimens of parenteral quinine for young African children with cerebral malaria: unbound quinine concentrations following a simple loading dose regimen.,"Nine children with severe falciparum malaria were treated with an intravenous quinine regimen which did not require burettes or infusion pumps, to determine its practicability and to ensure that therapeutic drug concentrations were achieved and maintained throughout the dose interval. The regimen comprised quinine dihydrochloride (15 mg/kg; 12.5 mg/kg of the free base), which was added to a bag of intravenous fluid (after wastage of all but 100 mL), and given via standard giving sets over 2 h. Blood was drawn sequentially during the infusion, and for 12 h thereafter; plasma water was obtained by ultrafiltration of samples at the bedside, and quinine concentration was measured, in plasma and plasma water, by high performance liquid chromatography. Drug administration was practicable without burettes or infusion pumps; unbound drug concentrations exceeded the 99% inhibitory concentration for local parasites within 0.5 h, and remained within the therapeutic range for the entire dose interval. This loading dose regimen can now be recommended for young children in African hospitals; maintenance doses of 10 mg/kg should be given at 12 h intervals until oral antimalarial drugs are possible. These recommendations will need to be modified if susceptibility to quinine declines."
CD008122,0,3059666,0,Recent applications of the Dot-ELISA in immunoparasitology.,"The dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dot-ELISA) is a highly versatile solid-phase immunoassay for antibody or antigen detection. The assay uses minute amounts of reagent dotted onto solid surfaces such as nitrocellulose and other paper membranes which avidly bind proteins. After incubation with antigen-specific antibody and enzyme-conjugated anti-antibody, the addition of a precipitable, chromogenic substrate causes the formation of a colored dot on the solid phase which is visually read. The Dot-ELISA has been used extensively in the detection of human and veterinary protozoan and metazoan parasitic diseases, including amebiasis, babesiosis, fascioliasis, cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, malaria, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, trichinosis, trypanosomiasis and even ixodid tick infestation. The technique is rapid, easy to perform and interpret, reagent conservative, cost effective and field portable. In addition, the Dot-ELISA may be configured to detect antibodies or parasite antigen in either microtiter plates for large-batch testing or with dipsticks for small numbers of determinations. A slight modification of the Dot-ELISA procedure allows the determination of infection rates of vectors such as ticks and sandflies with parasites."

In this report we assessed the frequency of HIV virus infection in persons with and without clinical AIDS and the association of virus isolation to presence of antibody. We isolated HIV from 27 (77%) of 35 patients with AIDS, and 5 of 9 patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC). Virus was also isolated from plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients in the study. The presence of antibody was a reliable marker for virus infection in African patients with AIDS. HIV was isolated from 5 of 27 control patients without AIDS, 3 of whom had normal T helper to T suppressor ratios and normal numbers of T helper cells. Two of these patients had no detectable antibody to HIV by ELISA or Western blot methods. In a population, such as the general heterosexual population of Kinshasa, with frequent infection by HIV and with few clearly definable risk groups, screening for antibodies to HIV may not be sufficient to identify some virus infected persons."
CD008122,0,11874880,0,Evaluation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis with crude or recombinant k39 antigen.,"The diagnosis of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a dermatosis that provides the only known reservoir for the parasite Leishmania donovani in India, remains a problem. Timely recognition and treatment of PKDL would contribute significantly to the control of kala-azar. We evaluated here the potential of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a diagnostic tool for PKDL. Antigen prepared from promastigotes and axenic amastigotes with parasite isolates that were derived from skin lesions of a PKDL patient gave sensitivities of 86.36 and 92%, respectively, in the 88 PKDL cases examined. The specificity of the ELISA test was examined by testing groups of patients with other skin disorders (leprosy and vitiligo) or coendemic infections (malaria and tuberculosis), as well as healthy controls from areas where this disease is endemic or is not endemic. A false-positive reaction was obtained in 14 of 144 (9.8%) of the controls with the promastigote antigen and in 14 of 145 (9.7%) of the controls with the amastigote antigen. Evaluation of the serodiagnostic potential of recombinant k39 by ELISA revealed a higher sensitivity (94.5%) and specificity (93.7%) compared to the other two antigens used. The data demonstrate that ELISA with crude or recombinant antigen k39 provides a relatively simple and less-invasive test for the reliable diagnosis of PKDL."
CD008122,0,2003927,0,Rapid colorimetric quantification of PCR-amplified DNA.,"A diagnostic system for rapid colorimetric quantification of the initial amount of DNA template amplified by the polymerase chain reaction is described. The method is based on co-amplification of target DNA with a cloned DNA fragment, in which a lac operator sequence has been introduced by in vitro mutagenesis. The in vitro-amplified material is immobilized on magnetic beads using the biotin-streptavidin system, and the ratio of target DNA to cloned mutated DNA can be determined using a fusion protein consisting of the Escherichia coli LacI repressor and beta-galactosidase. This method for quantitative detection of immobilized amplified nucleic acids is well adapted for rapid automated or semi-automated assays. Here, we show that it can be used to detect and quantify Plasmodium falciparum genomic DNA in clinical samples."
CD008122,0,12088854,0,Elevated levels of nitric oxide and low levels of haptoglobin are associated with severe malarial anaemia in African children.,"Severe malarial anaemia (SA) is a major complication of malaria and an important cause of child mortality and morbidity. However, the pathogenesis behind SA is poorly understood. Nitric oxide (NO) is known to play a protective role against clinical malaria but is also suggested to have a pathogenic role in cerebral malaria (CM). Erythrophagocytosis by splenic macrophages has been implicated in the pathogenesis of SA. In this study, plasma levels of NO, neopterin, haptoglobin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in paediatric patients with CM, n=77, SA (n=28) and uncomplicated malaria (UM n=53). Haptoglobin levels were significantly lower in SA (median (interquartile range) 25 (17-59) mg/l) than in both CM and UM (40 (24-80) mg/l and 110 (60-160) mg/l, respectively, P<0.001). In contrast, NO levels were higher in SA (38 (28-51) micromol/l) than in CM and UM (21 (15-32) micromol/l and 10.3 (5.6-17) micromol/l, respectively, P<0.001). A significant negative correlation between haptoglobin and NO was seen in the SA group. No such correlation was observed within the UM or CM groups. No significant differences in neopterin levels were observed between any of the three groups, neither was there any correlation between parasitaemias and neopterin levels. The low haptoglobin and high levels of NO in this SA group may contribute to haemolysis. Taken together our results support the hypothesis that immune-mediated erythrocyte destruction is involved in the pathogenesis of malarial anaemia."

CD008122,0,10983556,0,Formation of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes in vivo and in vitro relates to transmission intensity.,"Plasmodium falciparum isolates were collected during a cross-sectional survey of fever cases in an endemic area of northern India, over a period of 6 months (July-December 1996). Smears of peripheral blood from 118 cases were found to contain Plasmodium falciparum. Isolates of the parasites were successfully cultured in vitro, under identical conditions, from blood samples from 58 of the smear-positives who had asexual parasitaemias of at least 0.05%. Gametocytes developed from 50 of the 58 isolates, with a variable range of gametocytaemia. An isolate was most likely to produce gametocytes and to produce high gametocytaemias (i.e. > or = 1.0%) in vitro if it had been collected when the intensity of transmission (as reflected in bloodsmear positivity) was relatively high. A young child (< 6 years) with fever was more likely to be smear-positive for the asexual and sexual stages of P. falciparum, but less likely to be seropositive for antibodies to these stages, than the older cases of fever."

In all, 526 fever cases were screened for Plasmodium falciparum in October or November, 1999. Those found to be infected were treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and primaquine. Using microscopy as the gold standard, the new test had a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 87%. The positive and negative predictive values were 88% and 98%, respectively. Although follow-up of 64 subjects on day 7 post-treatment revealed that 20% of those who then appeared smear-negative were still antigenaemic, 34% of the subjects were still smear-positive, for asexual parasites, at that time. The Determine test was found to be very easy to perform and the results could be read reliably by field workers, without any supervision. The ease of use of the test indicates that it could be useful in the management of malaria, particularly in remote and inaccessible areas, provided that its accuracy can be assured and that it can be made affordable."
CD008122,0,15152184,0,"Multifocal autochthonous transmission of malaria--Florida, 2003.","The majority of malaria cases diagnosed in the United States are imported, usually by persons traveling from areas where malaria is endemic. However, small outbreaks of locally acquired mosquito-borne malaria continue to occur. During July-September 2003, an outbreak of malaria (eight cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria) occurred in Palm Beach County, Florida. During the same period, two patients were evaluated for malaria in neighboring Okeechobee County, approximately 75 miles from the Palm Beach County transmission area. One patient was thought to have acquired infection with the same parasite species (P. vivax), and concerns were raised about a possible link. To determine whether infection was acquired in Okeechobee County and whether a possible link existed to the Palm Beach County outbreak, the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) initiated an investigation. This report describes that investigation, which determined that although initial laboratory results suggested local transmission, subsequent evaluation and testing confirmed the case as imported malaria. These findings underscore the importance of a rapid and thorough investigation of any malaria case suspected to be acquired through local mosquito-borne transmission."

Analysis of the target sequence in the 18S rRNA gene indicated that in the DNA of isolates from both patients three nucleotides in the probe region from the typical P. ovale sequence were different, with deletions of two nucleotides and the substitution of one nucleotide.

CD008122,0,12096003,0,Two novel assays for the detection of haemin-binding properties of antimalarials evaluated with compounds isolated from medicinal plants.,"Forty-two compounds isolated from nine plants used within South America for the treatment of malaria were tested for haemin binding using two novel, rapid screening methods. The data obtained were analysed with respect to IC(50) values for in vitro toxicity to Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites. One method, a multiwell assay based on the inhibition of the interaction of haemin with glutathione (GSH), is sensitive in the 10 microM range, takes c. 1 h and is suitable for either a high throughput screen or rapid assay during natural product isolation. Of 19 compounds showing antiplasmodial activity (IC(50) < 40 microM), 16 (84%) showed >40% inhibition of GSH-haemin reaction. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 0.85 and 0.82, respectively. The positive predictive value was 0.81 and the negative predictive value 0.86. A more sensitive assay (0.1 microM range) is based on the reversal by haemin-binding compounds of the haemin inhibition of the L-dopachrome-methyl ester tautomerase activity of human macrophage migration inhibitory factor. This assay gives a better idea of the affinity of interaction and uses very small amounts of test compound. The log[RI(50)] of eight of the compounds that tested positive in the above assays together with those of quinine and chloroquine showed a positive correlation with log[antiplasmodial IC(50)] for strain T9-96 (r = 0.824) and strain K1 (r = 0.904). Several of the antimalarial compounds that bind haemin are isoquinolines, a class not shown previously to interact with haemin."
CD008122,0,19818170,0,Coartem: the journey to the clinic.,"Artemisinin, from which the artemether component of Coartem (artemether/lumefantrine, AL) is derived, is obtained from the plant sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua) which has been used for over 2,000 years as a Chinese herbal remedy. Artemisinin was first identified by Chinese researchers as the active anti-malarial constituent of A. annua and its derivatives were found to be the most potent of all anti-malarial drugs. Artemether acts rapidly, reducing the infecting parasite biomass by approximately 10,000-fold per asexual life cycle. Lumefantrine, the other active constituent of AL, acts over a longer period to eliminate the residual 100-100,000 parasites that remain after artemether is cleared from the body and thus minimizes the risk of recrudescence. The two agents have different modes of action and act at different points in the parasite life cycle and show a synergistic action against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. The combination of artemether and lumefantrine reduces the risk of resistance developing to either agent, and to date there are no reports of resistance to AL combined therapy in the malaria parasite that infects humans. Following a unique partnership agreement between Chinese authorities and Novartis, the manufacturer of AL, over 20 sponsored clinical studies have been undertaken in various malaria endemic regions and in travellers. These trials have involved more than 3,500 patients (including over 2,000 children), and led to identification of a six-dose, three-day regimen as the optimal dosing strategy for AL in uncomplicated falciparum malaria. AL has consistently shown 28-day polymerase chain (PCR)-corrected cure rates greater than 95% in the evaluable population, meeting WHO recommendations. More recently, Novartis and the Medicines for Malaria Venture have worked in partnership to develop Coartem Dispersible, a new formulation designed specifically to meet the specific needs of children with malaria. The dispersible tablets have shown similar high response rates to those observed with crushed standard tablets of AL. A partnership agreement between Novartis and WHO has seen over 250 million AL (Coartem) treatments (75% for children) being distributed to malaria patients in developing countries without profit, supported by training programmes and educational resources."

However non-specific systems, such as clinical surveillance, are also required. In French Guiana, we have tested a non-specific laboratory surveillance system where different biological examinations performed for other reasons than the diagnosis of dengue fever were analysed as methods for dengue fever surveillance. The number of negative malaria diagnoses in Cayenne and Kourou was found to be the best indicator of dengue fever infections in these towns. This surveillance system appears to be very simple and reliable, and a test which could serve as an indicator that is likely to be found everywhere."
CD008122,0,19527797,1,Cross-reactivity in rapid diagnostic tests between human malaria and zoonotic simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi infections.,"Plasmodium knowlesi has a relatively broad host range extending to humans, in whom it causes zoonotic malaria. Recent studies have shown that human infection with P. knowlesi is widely distributed in forested areas of Southeast Asia. In the present study, we evaluated commercial rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for human malaria to assess their reactivity and sensitivity in detecting P. knowlesi parasites using blood samples obtained from infected monkeys. The blood samples were assayed using two commercial RDTs based on immunochromatographic assays: (i) the OptiMAL-IT, designed to detect parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) of both P. falciparum and other plasmodia, and (ii) the Entebe Malaria Cassette (MC), designed to detect P. falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and P. vivax-specific pLDH. Interestingly, when the P. knowlesi-infected blood samples were examined with the RDTs, OptiMAL test results were interpreted as falciparum malaria-positive, while Entebe MC test results were interpreted as vivax malaria-positive. The sensitivities of both tests in detecting P. knowlesi parasite were similar to those for P. falciparum and higher than P. vivax. Thus, commercial RDTs based on detection of pLDH should be used with great caution, and should not replace conventional microscopy in the diagnosis of suspected cases of P. knowlesi malaria."
CD008122,0,14699261,0,ELISA detection of vivax malaria with recombinant multiple stage-specific antigens and its application to survey of residents in endemic areas.,"An ELISA was developed for the diagnosis of vivax malaria using multiple stage-specific recombinant antigens of Plasmodium vivax. The DNA from the whole blood of a malaria patient was used as template to amplify the coding regions for the antigenic domains of circumsporozoite protein (CSP-1), merozoite surface protein (MSP-1), apical merozoite antigen (AMA-1), serine repeat antigen (SERA), and exported antigen (EXP-1). Each amplified DNA fragment was inserted into pQE30 plasmid to induce the expression of His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli (M15 strain) by IPTG. His-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-NTA metal-affinity chromatography and used as antigens for ELISA with patient sera that were confirmed previously by blood smear examinations. When applied to patient sera, 122 (80.3%) out of 152 vivax malaria cases reacted to at least one antigen, while no reactions were observed with 128 uninfected serum samples. We applied this ELISA to the screening of 3,262 civilian residents in endemic regions near the DMZ, which resulted in 236 positively detected (7.2%) cases. This method can be applied to serological diagnosis and mass screening in endemic regions, or can be used as a safety test for transfusion blood in endemic areas."
CD008122,0,10497995,0,Serodiagnosis of leishmaniasis with recombinant ORFF antigen.,"The serodiagnostic potential of recombinant ORFF protein (rORFF) from Leishmania infantum was assessed by ELISA. Of 49 sera from confirmed cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), all were seropositive using 5 ng of rORFF and serum diluted 1:20, while only 38 were positive with 500 ng of soluble antigen (SA) and 44 were positive by a direct agglutination test. There was also a positive correlation between spleen size and level of seropositivity with rORFF or SA. The reciprocal endpoint titer with rORFF was 1,280 for sera from VL patients, but < 20 with sera from malaria, filariasis, and tuberculosis patients, as well as with sera from healthy individuals from endemic and non-endemic areas. Sera from 10 confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis cases from Turkey were negative or only weakly positive with rORFF although 9 were positive with SA. Thus, rORFF protein appears useful as a sensitive reagent for the differential diagnosis of VL caused by the Leishmania donovani complex."
CD008122,0,8488374,0,[Emergency blood picture].,"Assessment of peripheral blood counts and blood film analysis are frequently performed as diagnostic procedures in emergency medicine. Far fewer situations exist, however, in which these analyses are the main clue in establishing an emergency diagnosis. Artifacts can lead to wrong diagnosis, e.g. pseudo-thrombocytopenia, which is defined as a low platelet count resulting from a laboratory artifact. Severe neutropenia (agranulocytosis) and extreme hyperleukocytosis, as well as suspicion of acute leukemia, require a rapid diagnostic work-up. A newly detected anemia should not necessarily be treated by packed red cell transfusions. The decision whether an anemic patient ought to receive transfusions should be based on the speed with which the anemia has developed, as well as on clinical judgement. As a rule a chronic anemia patient with hemoglobin above 70 g/l does not need transfusions. An uncritical transfusion policy can even cause emergencies, e.g. in patients with megaloblastic anemia or in anemic multiple myeloma patients with a hyperviscosity syndrome. An elevated hematocrit requires prompt further investigations. This is of utmost importance if one considers the diagnosis of polycythemia vera rubra, a disease in which patients are particularly prone to thrombotic complications. Fragmented red cells (schistocytes) on peripheral blood smears constitute a cardinal diagnostic clue for the detection of microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (MAHA), in particular for the diagnosis of the life-threatening thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Malaria is another example for a chief role of blood smears examination in achieving a rapid diagnosis. If one encounters an unexpected severe thrombocytopenia, a marrow examination reveals whether it is due to rapid peripheral destruction, or due to a marrow failure. Furthermore, in any patients with an unanticipated thrombocytopenia, a disseminated intravascular coagulation and a MAHA should be ruled out. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare, but possibly fatal complication of therapy with heparins."
CD008122,0,12062556,0,Rapid genotyping of loci involved in antifolate drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum by primer extension.,"Current methods used to genotype point mutations in Plasmodium falciparum genes involved in resistance to antifolate drugs include restriction digestion of PCR products, allele-specific amplification or sequencing. Here we demonstrate that known point mutations in dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase can be scored quickly and accurately by single-nucleotide primer extension and detection of florescent products on a capillary sequencer. We use this method to genotype parasites in natural infections from the Thai-Myanmar border. This approach could greatly simplify large-scale screening of resistance mutations of the type required for evaluating and updating antimalarial drug treatment policies. The method can be easily adapted to other P. falciparum genes and will greatly simplify scoring of point mutations in this and other parasitic organisms."
CD008122,0,2692227,0,A comparative study of Lapudrine (chlorproguanil) and Maloprim (pyrimethamine and dapsone) as chemoprophylactics against malaria in Gambian children.,"A comparison has been made of Lapudrine (chlorproguanil) and Maloprim (pyrimethamine +dapsone) as malaria chemoprophylactics when given every two weeks for 3 years to Gambian children under the age of 5 years. Both drugs produced falls in spleen and malaria parasite rates and an increase in packed cell volume. Maloprim, but not chlorproguanil, significantly reduced the incidence of episodes of fever accompanied by malaria parasitaemia. Children who received Maloprim, but not those who received chlorproguanil, grew better than children in the placebo group. This finding suggests that brief clinical episodes of malaria are more important in impairing growth than more prolonged periods of asymptomatic parasitaemia. No serious side-effect attributable to either drug was observed. After chemoprophylaxis had been given for 3 malaria transmission seasons the level of resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to pyrimethamine and to chlorproguanil was about 10%."

CD008122,0,17158893,0,A novel chimeric Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite protein induces biologically functional antibodies that recognize both VK210 and VK247 sporozoites.,"A successful vaccine against Plasmodium vivax malaria would significantly improve the health and quality of the lives of more than 1 billion people around the world. A subunit vaccine is the only option in the absence of long-term culture of P. vivax parasites. The circumsporozoite protein that covers the surface of Plasmodium sporozoites is one of the best-studied malarial antigens and the most promising vaccine in clinical trials. We report here the development of a novel ""immunologically optimal"" recombinant vaccine expressed in Escherichia coli that encodes a chimeric CS protein encompassing repeats from the two major alleles, VK210 and VK247. This molecule is widely recognized by sera from patients naturally exposed to P. vivax infection and induces a highly potent immune response in genetically disparate strains of mice. Antibodies from immunized animals recognize both VK210 and VK247 sporozoites. Furthermore, these antibodies appear to be protective in nature since they cause the agglutination of live sporozoites, an in vitro surrogate of sporozoite infectivity. These results strongly suggest that recombinant CS is biologically active and highly immunogenic across major histocompatibility complex strains and raises the prospect that in humans this vaccine may induce protective immune responses."
CD008122,0,17609321,0,Real-time PCR assay for rapid detection and analysis of PfCRT haplotypes of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum isolates from India.,"Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CRPF) malaria isolates in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa share the same Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) haplotype (CVIET; amino acids 72 to 76). It is believed that CRPF malaria emerged in Southeast Asia and spread to sub-Saharan Africa via the Indian subcontinent. Based on this assumption, we hypothesized that CRPF isolates in India should possess the same drug resistance haplotype (PfCRT haplotype CVIET) as P. falciparum isolates in Southeast Asia and Africa and that the prevalence of CRPF may be higher and more widespread in India than appreciated. To test this postulate, we utilized a standardized real-time PCR assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of PfCRT haplotypes in P. falciparum isolates (n = 406) collected from Western, Central, and Eastern states in India and compared them to isolates from South America and Africa. Based on the proportion of isolates possessing the molecular marker K76T, the prevalence of chloroquine resistance was high in all five regions of India studied (91%), as well as in Uganda (98%) and Suriname (100%). All isolates from Suriname contained the chloroquine-resistant SVMNT haplotype typical of South American isolates, and 98% of isolates from Uganda possessed the chloroquine-resistant CVIET haplotype characteristic of Southeast Asian/African strains. However, of 246 P. falciparum isolates from across India that contained the molecular marker for chloroquine resistance, 81% contained the SVMNT haplotype. In conclusion, the prevalence of CRPF malaria was high in geographically dispersed regions of India, and the primary haplotype observed, SVMNT, did not support a presumed geographic spread from contiguous Southeast Asia."
CD008122,0,10354353,0,Antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidates in infants in an area of intense and perennial transmission: relationships with clinical malaria and with entomological inoculation rates.,"Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G1, IgG3 and total IgG were assessed by immunoabsorbent assay in 198 infants from a Tanzanian village highly endemic for Plasmodium falciparum. Antibodies were measured against epitopes of the circumsporozoite protein (the repetitive epitope (NANP)50 and a construct of the flanking regions (CS27IC)), the malaria vaccine SPf66, and two constructs of the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), a 19-kDa fragment from the C-terminal domain (MSP-119) and an N-terminal fragment spanning blocks 1-6 (H6-p190 M-1/6-H6). IgG1 and total IgG titres showed similar age profiles, all decreasing for the first 2 months of life. Anti-(NANP)50 titres remained very low throughout the first year of life, while anti-CS27IC antibody appeared to peak around 7 months of age. Only a slight tendency to increase with age was observed for levels of the other antibodies studied. IgG3 titres except for H6-p190(1/6), were very low initially and remained very low throughout the first year of life. Clinical malaria incidence at the village dispensary was analysed prospectively in relation to antibody. No IgG1 or total IgG titre showed protective effects, but low IgG3 against p190(1/6) appeared to be a risk factor in some age groups. Given the large number of antibodies tested, this single indication of possible protection could merely be chance. There were no strong associations between antibody titres and entomologically assessed sporozoite exposure suggesting that transmission-reducing interventions may have little effect on antibody levels in such children."

The serodiagnostic and prognostic potential of BSM as a capture antigen was established by ELISA with no cross reactivity with coendemic diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, chagas disease and cutaneous leishmaniasis; however, a strong cross reactivity was present with trypanosomiasis patients. In 56 clinically diagnosed VL patients, the BSM-ELISA was compared with diagnosis by microscopy using Giemsa stained tissue smears and direct ELISA using crude parasite antigen (parasite-ELISA); 49/56(87.5%) and 5/56(9.0%) were positive and negative respectively by all 3 methods. The BSM-ELISA failed to diagnose 2/56(3.5%) patients which were biopsy and parasite-ELISA positive. The prognostic potential of the BSM-ELISA in 18 longitudinally monitored VL patients before and after conventional antimonial treatment showed a significant decrease in anti O-AcSA titres in drug responsive patients whereas anti O-AcSA levels persisted in drug unresponsive patients. The IgG subclass distribution of antibodies directed against O-AcSA showed increased IgG2 levels in VL patients as compared to healthy controls. The BSM-based ELISA holds great promise as a serodiagnostic and prognostic assay for VL."

Pre-departure malaria screening and targeted treatment was conducted to prevent morbidity, and minimize the potential for local malaria transmission post-arrival. We screened 902 of 906 refugees using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Twelve (1.3%) RDT results were positive and 28 (3.1%) were indeterminate. Microscopy confirmed Plasmodium species in two of the positive RDT and one of the indeterminate results. Among a random 10% sample of negative RDT results (n = 86), none were positive by microscopy. The PCR confirmed the two microscopically (and RDT) positive specimens. The PCR result was negative for all other specimens tested. Eighteen (2.0%) refugees were treated with antimalarials. The RDTs were useful in this setting, facilitating timely, sensitive diagnosis and targeted treatment. Evaluations to determine the most appropriate interventions in other refugee settings should include cost-effectiveness analyses of alternative strategies."

CD008122,0,3300391,0,Antibodies to the PF155 antigen of Plasmodium falciparum: measurement by cell-ELISA and correlation with expected immune protection.,"Plasmodium falciparum polypeptide Pf155 is one of the main candidates for a vaccine against asexual blood stages of P. falciparum. Antibodies against Pf155 can be detected by a cell-ELISA technique with glutaraldehyde-fixed and air dried P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes as antigen. Using this assay, we measured the level of antibodies in sera from 230 subjects with various degrees of past exposure to P. falciparum. Significant levels of antibodies (OD492 greater than 0.5) were detected in 41/50 sera from Central African adults and in 34/50 sera from West African adults. All sera from 50 European adults suffering primary malarial attack and 28/30 sera from West African children (10 to 12 years old) were negative. Intermediate results were obtained with 50 sera from West African adults living in France for greater than or equal to 2 years (12 positive). Mean OD values of the sera of these five groups of subjects varied in the same direction as the positivity rates. These preliminary results suggest that the level of anti-Pf155 antibodies as detected by cell-ELISA might provide an assessment of protective immunity against P. falciparum which could complement clinical or epidemiological criteria."

The study was carried out in Buea, South West Province, Cameroon. Subjects consulting at health care facilities in Buea were randomly recruited into the study. A total of 121 febrile patients 1-60 years old comprised the study subjects. Thin and thick blood films were prepared for malaria parasite detection. G-6-P-D enzyme activity was assayed using the met-haemoglobin reduction test. Determination of haemoglobin genotypes was by a rapid screening method alongside electrophoresis. Malaria positive patients were treated. The highest malaria prevalence of 74.5 % was in Group O individuals and the lowest of 58.6% in group B individuals. Mean parasite density (Log(10)(-1)/ul blood) in the various blood groups was not significantly different. Individuals with G-6-P-D deficiency had a significantly lower malaria prevalence (47.5%) when compared with active individuals. Mean parasite density in enzyme deficient and active individuals was 3.7(SD+/- 3.9) and 4.4(SD +/-5.0) respectively and the difference was significant (p < 0.05). Malaria prevalence was lower (57.5%) in HbS individuals when compared with HbAA (74.6%) and HbSS (60%) but parasite density was not significantly different. Our results suggest that individuals with blood group O who have the HbAA genotype and show G-6-P-D enzyme activity may be more susceptible to malaria. Information on the influence of these genetic factors on malaria would be useful in the better management of the disease in the study area."

CD008122,0,10802320,0,"Identification of a novel antigenic domain of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 that specifically binds to human erythrocytes and inhibits parasite invasion, in vitro.","Merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium falciparum is a promising candidate for vaccine development against malaria. Identification of protective epitopes within MSP-1 is an important step towards the elucidation of mechanisms of parasitic invasion and for the creation of a multi-subunit vaccine. In this study, we show that a 115 amino acid region (p115MSP-1) within the p38 domain of MSP-1 can: (i) specifically bind to human erythrocytes, independent of glycophorin A; (ii) inhibit parasite invasion at significant levels, in vitro; and (iii) be recognized by human sera of individuals from malaria-endemic regions of Africa. More importantly, we also show that polyclonal antibodies specific to this region prevent parasite invasion at levels approaching 90%, in vitro. Our data illustrate that not only is p115MSP-1 involved in parasite recognition/invasion of human erythrocytes, but that this region is highly antigenic, producing high titer antibodies. The delineation of the role of MSP-1 in parasite invasion is an important component of the development of a multi-subunit malaria vaccine, and this study identifies a candidate antigen in this context."

In this study, we report a novel and highly sensitive optical-based detection of malaria-infected blood cells by third harmonic generation (THG) imaging of hemozoin pigment that is naturally deposited by the parasite during its lifecycle. The THG signal from the hemozoin was greater than we have observed in any cell type with signal/noise ratios that reach 1000:1. This method allows a rapid and robust detection of early stage infections of blood cells. The immense nonlinear response of the intrinsic parasitic by-product pigments suggests that automated optical detection by THG could be used for sensitive and rapid screening of parasite infection in blood samples."

An octameric MAP, carrying 6 repeats of the sequence -N-A-A-G-, tandem repeated in the immunodominant region of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium malariae, was used as a model to evaluate the suitability of the MAP system in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting antibodies against a parasite antigen in individuals exposed to natural infection. The reaction of endemic sera in ELISA on MAP8-(NAAG)6 was related to that obtained in immunofluorescence on sporozoites, indicating the specificity of the antibody-MAP interaction. The reactivity of immune sera was found to be directed only against the (NAAG)6 moiety of the MAP and not against the lysyl core, since antibody binding to MAP8-(NAAG)6 was completely inhibited by (NAAG)6-NA monomer, but remained uninfluenced when lysyl core was used as competing ligand. The levels of antibodies to MAP8-(NAAG)6, in two groups of individuals naturally exposed to malaria infection, appeared to be related to their respective exposure to the parasite."

Significantly raised levels of alphaPC were observed in infected individuals in comparison with controls. The IgG alphaPC were found to be generally more than IgM alphaPC in most cases. The IgG alphaPC levels were significantly more in those cases of cerebral malaria who recovered fully after quinine administration in comparison with fatal cases not responding to quinine therapy, indicating a role for alphaPC in prognosis of adult cerebral malaria. There was no significant difference in levels of alphaPC IgG between non-cerebral and fatal cerebral malaria patients, indicating an absence of a direct protective role in the development of cerebral manifestations. Subgroup typing of IgG with alphaPC activity indicated IgG3 to be the predominant type, followed by IgG2, IgG1 and IgG4. A significant inverse relationship between serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels and IgG1 antibodies with alphaPC activity was found, emphasizing the importance of alphaPC in modifying disease severity. These observations appear to give credence to recent reports in the literature indicating that toxic malarial antigens consist of phospholipids and that antibodies to phospholipids (alphaPL) inhibit such antigens in experimental systems."

Infected cells were concentrated using a discontinuous Percoll gradient and detergent-soluble antigens obtained using Triton X100. The use of detergent and the addition of protease inhibitors to the antigen preparation ensured high sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay. No cross reactions were observed in sera immune to other protozoan, helmintic and bacterial infections, although some cross reactivity was seen in P. falciparum immune sera. A strong correlation between antibody titre values obtained by the ELISA and those obtained using an IFAT was observed. In a small field trial, carried out in a village where malaria transmission occurs, both ELISA and IFAT produced similar seroepidemiological profiles with regard to frequency of positive antibody titres and their distribution among the different age groups of the population."

The design was a prospective cohort study involving 548 short-term Dutch travelers to areas endemic for P. falciparum malaria. Sera were collected before departure and, together with the medical history, 2-6 weeks after return. All sera were tested for anti-circumsporozoite (CS) antibodies by an R32tet32-ELISA; sera of subjects reporting febrile illness during travel or after return or with anti-CS responses were tested for anti-blood-stage antibodies by an indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Five subjects (0.9%) reported P. falciparum malaria confirmed by thick blood smear examination (documented cases) and six (1.0%) reported treatment for malaria without a documented diagnosis (presumptive cases). Conversions in the IFAT were detected in six subjects, including all five documented cases and one presumptive case. Anti-CS antibodies were detected in seven subjects (1.3%), including three documented cases and four of 442 subjects with no history of fever or malaria treatment (0.9%). Incidence rates per 1,000 person-months of travel (95% confidence interval) of infection with P. falciparum, whether or not suppressed by chemoprophylaxis, were 16.9 (8-31) for all destinations and 91.6 (33-200) for West Africa. In epidemiologic studies of P. falciparum malaria in travelers, testing for antibodies to blood stages can increase the sensitivity and specificity of case detection; testing for antibodies to sporozoites may be useful for the assessment of exposure to P. falciparum in travelers using chemoprophylaxis, but the sensitivity is limited."

It was proved that this test allowed to diagnose the Plasmodium sp. antigen in 72% of examined blood specimens, 82% for P. falciparum infection and 69% for P. vivax, whereas P. ovale was not detected at all. The test sensitivity depended on the parasitemia level. It showed a sensitivity of 100% for parasitemia density exceeded 1%, 95.4% with the parasitemia ranging from 0.1-0.99%. For lower parasite density, the test's sensitivity was of 32 and 60%. The OptiMAL test showed a 99.1% specificity thus it revealed to be significantly high."
CD008122,0,15007639,1,Performance of an immunochromatographic test for the rapid diagnosis of malaria.,"The immunochromatographic test (ICT) for the rapid diagnosis of malaria has been marketed for several years. In a study in which three Centres of Tropical Medicine participated and data were pooled, performance of the test varied considerably when comparing the results between each centre. The sensitivity of ICT in 2,343 patients tested in our services was 100% and the specificity 99.74%. Moreover, two patients with a positive ICT would initially have been missed by expert microscopy, with Plasmodium falciparum malaria being confirmed microscopically some hours later. The principal reasons for the better performance of the test in our series appear to be blood collection in EDTA vials and considerable experience with handling and interpreting the ICT test."
CD008122,0,8236464,0,Malaria chemosuppression during pregnancy. IV. Its effects on the newborn's passive malaria immunity.,"The effect of malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy on the levels of cord blood anti-sporozoite antibodies was investigated in 203 newborns in Muheza, Tanzania. Mothers of 76 newborns had received prophylaxis with proguanil daily (PROG), 66 chloroquine once weekly (CQ), and 61 got a combination of the two drugs (CQ+PROG). Prophylaxis with PROG or CQ+PROG was more efficacious than with CQ. The mean antibody titres were comparable in all three groups, despite titres being significantly low in mothers of the CQ+PROG group. In 93% of 167 paired maternal-cord sera, maternal titres were higher than cord titres. The correlation between maternal and cord titres was low. Parity, placental malaria, and baby maturity showed little influence on titres. Titres of babies delivered by Caesarean section or whose placenta weighed between 0.75 and 1 kg were comparatively low. The first occurrence of a malaria parasitaemia in infants was independent of the levels of cord titres at birth. The results suggested that chemoprophylaxis as effective as PROG or CQ+PROG in holoendemic areas, insignificantly affects maternal-foetal transfer of anti-sporozoite antibodies, and that levels of these antibodies at birth do not modulate the first occurrence of infancy malaria parasitaemia. Interference with the maternal-foetal transfer of this antibody and possibly other component antibodies of passive immunity should not limit the selection of PROG or CQ+PROG for chemoprophylaxis."
CD008122,0,9692150,0,Clinical features cannot predict a diagnosis of malaria or differentiate the infecting species in children living in an area of low transmission.,"The differentiation of malaria from other causes of fever in the absence of microscopy is notoriously difficult. Clinical predictors of malaria have been studied in an area of low and unstable transmission on the western border of Thailand. In 1527 children aged 2-15 years who were followed prospectively for 7 months, 82% (1254) had at least one febrile episode. Malaria caused 24% (301) of the first febrile episodes (Plasmodium falciparum 128, P. vivax 151, P. malariae 1, mixed infections with P. falciparum and P. vivax 21). Each malaria case was matched with the next child of similar age presenting to the dispensary with another cause of fever. Clinical symptoms or signs associated with a final diagnosis of malaria were: confirmed fever (> or = 38 degrees C) (odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.4-1.9), headache (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.9), muscle and/or joint pain (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.6-2.8), nausea (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.3), clinical anaemia (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-3.3), palpable spleen (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7), palpable liver (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-2.1), absence of cough (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-2.0), and absence of diarrhoea (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-2.4). None of these signs alone or in combination proved a good predictor of malaria. The best diagnostic algorithms (history of fever and headache without cough, and history of fever with an oral temperature > or = 38 degrees C [sensitivity 51% for both, specificity 72 and 71%, respectively]) would result in prescription of antimalarial drugs in 28-29% of the non-malaria febrile episodes, and only 49% of the true malaria cases. Thus half of the potentially life-threatening P. falciparum infections would not be treated. Although multivariate analysis identified vomiting, confirmed fever, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly as independent risk factors for a diagnosis of falciparum malaria, use of these signs to differentiate falciparum from vivax malaria, and thus to determine antimalarial treatment, was insufficiently sensitive or specific. Malaria diagnosis should be confirmed by microscopical examination of a blood slide or the use of specific dipstick tests in areas of low transmission where highly drug-resistant P. falciparum coexists with P. vivax."
CD008122,0,1949134,0,Safety and immunogenicity of a Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite vaccine: boosting of antibody response in a population with prior natural exposure to malaria.,"Recombinant sporozoite vaccine or placebo were administered once to 25 volunteers from an area endemic for malaria. Antibody to R32tet32 rose in 9 of 15 receiving vaccine and remained elevated in 6 for 6 months. Mean absorbance increase was 0.43 +/- 0.40 with vaccine, 0.01 +/- 0.23 with placebo, and 0.72 +/- 0.19 in responders. Six non-responders had significantly lower pre-immunization levels (0.07 +/- 0.05) than responders (0.39 +/- 0.25). There was an association between an increase in immunofluorescence (n = 4) and an increase in absorbance (n = 9) among vaccine recipients (n = 15). Vaccine-induced increase in antibody to natural circumsporozoite antigen was indicated by increases in immunofluorescence and by increases in circumsporozoite precipitation score in 2 of the 5 responders with highest antibody increase measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Response to subunit sporozoite vaccine paralleled response to prior natural sporozoite exposure and was significant and prolonged in a population with prior natural exposure to malaria."
CD008122,0,16113298,0,HLA-A2 supertype-restricted cell-mediated immunity by peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from Malian children with severe or uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and healthy controls.,"Understanding HLA-restricted adaptive host immunity to defined epitopes of malarial antigens may be required for the development of successful malaria vaccines. Fourteen epitopes of preerythrocytic malarial antigens known to mediate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses against target cells expressing HLA-A2-restricted epitopes were synthesized and pooled based on antigen: thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP), circumsporozoite protein (CSP), and export protein 1 (Exp-1) peptides. HLA-A2 supertype (*0201, *0202, *0205, *6802) peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from 774 Malian children, aged 3 months to 14 years, with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria matched to uncomplicated malaria or healthy controls were stimulated with the HLA-A2-restricted peptide pools. Significant gamma interferon production, determined by enzyme-linked immunospot assay to at least one of the three peptide pools, was observed in 24/58 (41%) of the severe malaria cases, 24/57 (42%) of the uncomplicated malaria cases, and 34/51 (67%) of the healthy controls. Significant lymphoproliferation to these peptides was observed in 12/44 (27%) of the severe malaria cases, 13/55 (24%) of the uncomplicated malaria cases, and 18/50 (36%) of the healthy controls. Responses to individual peptide pools were limited. These studies confirm the presence of adaptive cell-mediated immunity to preerythrocytic malaria antigens in volunteers from Mali and demonstrate that suballeles of the HLA-A2 supertype can effectively present antigenic epitopes. However, whether these immune responses to TRAP, CSP, and Exp-1 malarial proteins play a substantial role in protection remains a matter of controversy."

A wide range of parasite proteins with apparent molecular weights of 14 to 250 kilodaltons (Kd) were immunoprecipitated by the sera. Of these, two polypeptides of 41 and 96 Kd could be associated with parasite growth inhibition in vitro."
CD008122,0,2692217,0,"Age-related prevalence of antibody response against three different, defined Plasmodium falciparum antigens in children from the Haut-Ogooué province in Gabon.","The kinetics of the humoral response to defined Plasmodium falciparum antigens was studied in 543 children, 1 month to 15 years old, living in an area endemic for malaria. The antigens used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were (i) the synthetic peptide (NANP)40 representing the immunodominant repeated region of the circumsporozoite protein, and (ii) the fusion peptide 31.1, representing the N-terminal portion of the 83 kDa polypeptide expressed at the surface of merozoites which is a processed product of the 190-200 kDa glycoprotein. In addition, glutaraldehyde-fixed infected red blood cells (RBC) were used to detect ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) and unfixed infected RBC to detect intra-erythrocytic asexual form (IEF) antigens by immunofluorescence. In the 1 to 2 months age group, 50%, 26% and 21% of the children had antibodies for IEF, (NANP)40 and 31.1 respectively, but none had anti-RESA antibodies. The proportions of positive subjects decreased until 3 to 6 months and then increased progressively for the 4 antigens, approaching, but not reaching, adult values by the age of 15 years. Antibodies against specific antigens were acquired concomitantly. Children born from (NANP)40-positive mothers showed enhanced anti-(NANP)40 IgG responses."
CD008122,0,16354819,0,Antibody response profiles induced by Plasmodium falciparum glutamate-rich protein in naturally exposed individuals from a Brazilian area endemic for malaria.,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the antibody response induced by Plasmodium falciparum glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) in naturally exposed individuals from the Brazilian Amazon region (Rondonia State). The results showed that most individuals had IgG against two well-defined regions within P. falciparum GLURP, the relatively conserved N-terminal nonrepeat region (R0) and the immunodominant repeat region (R2), 67% and 79%, respectively. The peptides S4 from R2 (53%) and P11 from R0 (49%) were identified as immunodominant B cell epitopes and induced higher levels of antibodies. The number of GLURP peptides recognized and the levels of IgG against S4 and P11 peptides showed a positive correlation with age and time of exposure in the malaria-endemic area studied. The antibody responses against GLURP epitopes appear to be modulated by HLA class II antigens. Interestingly, the GLURP immunodominant B cell epitopes in individuals from a Brazilian malaria-endemic area are distinguishable from those of the African malaria-endemic area. Considering the importance of GLURP as a malaria vaccine candidate and the increasing focus on the use of subunit vaccines in the control of infectious diseases, the concern of the influence of class II allele frequencies in ethnically diverse populations may be important before vaccine trials are conducted among people naturally exposed to malaria parasites."
CD008122,0,7541824,0,HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to multiple Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface protein 2 epitopes in sporozoite-immunized volunteers.,"CD8+ CTL specific for the Plasmodium yoelii sporozoite surface protein 2 (PySSP2) protect mice against malaria. For this reason, vaccines designed to induce CTL against P. falciparum SSP2 (PfSSP2) are under development. Optimal development of PfSSP2 as a component of human malaria vaccines requires characterization of HLA class I-restricted CTL against this Ag. For this purpose, PBMC from four HLA-A2+ human volunteers immunized with P. falciparum irradiated sporozoites were stimulated with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing PfSSP2 and with 35 PfSSP2-derived 15-amino acid peptides containing sequences conforming to HLA-A2 binding motifs. Ag-specific, genetically restricted, CD8+ T cell-dependent cytotoxic activity against autologous target cells transfected with the PfSSP2 gene was demonstrated in the four volunteers. Twelve of the 35 peptides sensitized HLA-A2-matched target cells for lysis by peptide-stimulated effectors. Three volunteers had CTL against 9 of the 12 peptides, and one had no peptide-specific CTL. HLA-A*0201 restriction was confirmed by demonstrating that effectors from the three responders could be stimulated with six different peptides to lyse HLA-A*0201+ T2 cells incubated with the homologous peptides. Peptide-specific, genetically restricted, CD8+ T cell-dependent cytotoxic activity was also demonstrated against two peptides using unstimulated PBMC as effectors. Available data indicate that the motif-bearing sequences in 6 of the 12 positive peptides are conserved among P. falciparum isolates and clones. Demonstration of HLA-A2-restricted CTL responses to multiple PfSSP2-derived peptides, and of circulating activated CTL against PfSSP2 in immune volunteers provide important information for optimal design and evaluation of vaccines containing this pre-erythrocytic stage Ag."
CD008122,0,3075353,0,"Dot-ELISA, a potential immunoassay for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum antibodies.","The dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) was compared to the indirect immunofluorescent assay (IIFA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the detection of malaria antibodies. Of 281 sera tested by dot-ELISA, 220 were from Ethiopia, 11 from the Sudan, and 50 from Egypt. A close correlation between the dot-ELISA and RIA results was observed in 92% of the 220 Ethiopian cases. Of the remainder, 6% gave positive RIA and negative dot-ELISA results, and 2% gave positive dot-ELISA and negative RIA results. Antibody titres determined by dot-ELISA and RIA were positively correlated in 10 of the 11 Sudanese cases tested by direct microscopical examination. The eleventh case was positive by dot-ELISA at 1:1000 dilution, but negative by RIA and direct examination. With the 50 Egyptian sera, the dot-ELISA results showed close correspondence to the IIFA results, but the dot-ELISA was 20-40 fold more sensitive than the IIFA. To test specificity, 62 samples from patients with 11 different diseases and conditions were examined by dot-ELISA. No malaria antibodies were detected in any of these or in sera from healthy controls. Dot-ELISA is a potentially useful method for sero-epidemiological studies of malaria."
CD008122,0,15022615,0,[Diagnosis of tropical malaria by express-methods].,"An examination of a thick blood drop and of blood smear for the presence of plasmodia is a classic and indisputable diagnostic test for tropic malaria. However, express-methods, based on the immune-enzyme analysis, have been introduced into the health-care practice primarily in developing and underdeveloped countries. The diagnosis of tropic malaria by using the discussed methods enables, in the non-laboratory settings, a rapid and reliable detection of PI. falciparum in blood. This is important because an untimely diagnosis of tropic malaria increases the risk of the lethal outcome."
CD008122,0,3048761,0,A quantitative approach to recommendations on malaria prophylaxis.,"In order to develop recommendations for malaria prophylaxis, a quantitative method is needed to balance the risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infections against the toxicity of antimalarial drugs. Using decision analysis, we estimated the expected mortality associated with three alternative regimens of prophylactic drugs for visitors to three areas with different risks of infection with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. The model used took into account the risks of malaria and of adverse reactions to antimalarial drugs. Estimates of the parameters used in the analysis were based on observations made on U.S. travellers. Reducing the risk of malaria infection was found to have a far greater impact on lowering the expected mortality than that of increasing the chemoprophylactic efficacy of the drugs used, thereby emphasizing the need for travellers to use anti-mosquito measures in malarious areas. The analytical method described can be used to define optimal malaria prevention strategies."
CD008122,0,17080701,0,Evaluation of malaria endemicity by peptide ELISA.,"Interest in mapping the malaria transmission has motivated a need to develop a simple serological assay in a defined population. Evaluation of coded samples by peptide ELISA provided a framework to estimate the malarial impact. Comparison of field data and ELISA OD values in different malariogenic areas shows how the disease has been more correctly interpreted. Here we provide an empirical approach to estimate Annual Parasite Index (API) as well as Equivalent Transmission Index (ETI) using a combination of epidemiological, parasitological and immunological data. We estimate that there were 3 different malariogenic status like low, moderate and high transmission zones based on their' ELISA OD values. Our indigenous developed ETI estimates are 10 fold higher than API reported by the Primary Health Centre. Our record indicates that incidences of malaria will continue to be underestimated unless we adapt an alternative strategy. In order to verify the scope of malaria surveillance, coded samples were tested. Comparison of ELISA OD, API and ETI of the coded samples indicated Rourkela had high, Shahjahanpur had moderate and Bangalore had the lowest malaria transmission. For mass blood slide examination, microscopic method is a tedious process prone to human error while largely automated ELISA could reduce the scope for human error and could be a supplement for microscopic process."
CD008122,0,18579264,0,High immunogenecity and erythrocyte-binding activity in the tryptophan-rich domain (TRD) of the 74-kDa Plasmodium vivax alanine-tryptophan-rich antigen (PvATRAg74).,"Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread species of human malaria parasite affecting 70-80 million people worldwide each year. In recent years, some potential vaccine candidate antigens from P. vivax have been identified including tryptophan-rich antigens PvTRAg and PvTARAg55. We report here the identification and partial characterization of a 74 kDa P. vivax alanine-tryptophan-rich antigen (PvATRAg74) which is expressed by all asexual blood stages of the parasite. This protein contains two major domains, i.e. alanine-rich domain (ARD) in N-terminal region and the tryptophan-rich domain (TRD) at C-terminus. PvATRAg74 also contains variable numbers of octa-peptide repeats in the ARD region. The C-terminal PvATRAg74 containing TRD was highly conserved among 32 P. vivax isolates while N-terminal ARD showed genetic polymorphisms. The 36 kDa TRD was expressed in E. coli and named here as His6-TRD. The purified recombinant His6-TRD showed binding with uninfected human erythrocytes. This antigen was also recognized by all 38 P. vivax patients' sera on ELISA thus showing a very high seropositivity rates. In vitro stimulation of lymphocytes with purified His6-TRD indicated that it induced T cell immune response in majority (94%, n=16) of P. vivax exposed individuals. The stimulated T cells produced higher amount of IL-4 and IL-10 than IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-12 indicating a Th2 type of response bias. Unlike PvTARAg55, this antigen is more immunogenic in humans and possesses the erythrocyte-binding activity. Immunogenecity of PvATRAg74 is similar to PvTRAg whose erythrocyte-binding activity still remains unknown."
CD008122,0,15584018,0,Detection of a Plasmodium vivax erythrocyte binding protein by flow cytometry.,The malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax preferentially invades reticulocytes. It is therefore relevant for vaccine development purposes to identify and characterize P. vivax proteins that bind specifically to the surface of reticulocytes. We have developed a two-color flow cytometric erythrocyte binding assay (F-EBA) that has several advantages over traditional erythrocyte binding assays (T-EBAs) used in malaria research. We demonstrate the use of F-EBA using the P. vivax Duffy binding protein region II (PvDBP-RII) recombinant protein as a model. This protein binds to all erythrocytes that express the Duffy receptor (Fy) and discriminates binding between normocytes and reticulocytes.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the test for diagnosis of imported malaria. A total of 244 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of imported malaria in France were included during the study period. The reference test, i.e., combined thick and thin blood films, demonstrated infection by Plasmodium falciparum in 58 cases, Plasmodium vivax in 12, P. ovale in 8 and Plasmodium malariae in 2. The OptiMal test detected only 46 of the 55 Plasmodium falciparum cases. The sensitivity of the test for diagnosis of that species was 80%, its specificity was 98%, and its positive and negative predictive values were 95 and 93% respectively. Parsitemia studies showed poor test reliability for densities lower than 150/ul. Detection of other species was accurate in 21 out of 22. The results of this study demonstrate that the current version of the OptiMal test should be used with great caution for the diagnosis of malarial infection in hospital practice."
CD008122,0,17172391,0,Deaths caused by malaria in Switzerland 1988-2002.,"Despite sophisticated intensive medicine, between one and three malaria-associated deaths occur annually in Switzerland. In this retrospective study, 33 deaths (25 men and 8 women) caused by falciparum malaria reported in Switzerland from 1988 to 2002 were analyzed. The case fatality ratio (CFR) for the falciparum infections for the 15-year period was 1.2%, with a peak of 2.2% in 1991. Sub-Saharan Africa was the source of all the imported fatal infections. Non-immune Europeans had a significantly higher case fatality ratio than the non-Europeans (1.7% versus 0.2%; P < 0.001). Careless use or non-use of prophylaxis, sometimes because of physicians giving unsatisfactory pre-travel advice, and initially missed diagnosis post-travel were factors that contributed to the development of severe infections leading to death. Travelers should be sensitized to the risk of malaria by well-informed general practitioners. Updated information is readily available (www.safetravel.ch). Regarding diagnosis and treatment, greater physician awareness of the disease is needed, and expert advice should be sought without hesitation. Rapid malaria tests may be a useful diagnostic adjunct in centers where microscopic expertise is lacking. Falciparum malaria in a non-immune patient is an emergency requiring immediate treatment."

Cross-reactivity was further indicated by the presence of 10 bands ranging from 134 kDa to 18 kDa on immunoblots of electrophoresed whole lysate P. falciparum antigen against serum of HTLV-1 seropositive patients from an area where malaria is not present. Similarly, sera from patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a non-malarious region produced immunoblot bands ranging from 134 kDa to 33 kDa to the P. falciparum antigen. The HTLV-1 and HIV serum samples yielded a number of immunoblot bands when reacted to an electrophoresed human O type red cell membrane antigen, but those bands had no identity to the cross-reactive bands on the P. falciparum antigen immunoblots. Malaria-positive sera from Papua New Guinean subjects presumed to be uninfected with HIV produced a variety of bands, some of intense prominence, to HIV antigen on diagnostic Western blots."
CD008122,0,17172395,1,Evaluation of three rapid tests for diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria in Colombia.,"The diagnostic capacity of three malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), NOW-Malaria-ICT, OptiMAL-IT, and Paracheck-Pf, was evaluated against expert microscopy in Colombia. We tested 896 patients, of whom microscopy confirmed 139 P. falciparum, 279 P. vivax, and 13 mixed P.f/P.v infections and 465 negatives. Paracheck-Pf and NOW-malaria-ICT were more accurate in detecting P. falciparum (sensitivities 90.8% and 90.1%, respectively) in comparison with Optimal-IT (83.6%). NOW showed an acceptable Pf detection rate at low densities (< 500/microL), but resulted in a higher proportion of false positives. For P. vivax diagnosis, Optimal-IT had a higher sensitivity than NOW (91.0% and 81.4%, respectively). The choice between the two Pf/Pv detecting RDTs balances P. falciparum and P. vivax detection rates. Considering some degree of P. falciparum overtreatment and failure to detect all P. vivax cases as more acceptable than missing some cases of P. falciparum, we recommend careful implementation of NOW-malaria-ICT in areas where microscopy is lacking. The price is however still a constraint."

Active malaria transmission was occurring in all studied sites, except in Acre. P. falciparum was the predominant species in Pará and Rondônia and P. vivax in Mato Grosso. Infection by P. malariae was low but this Plasmodium species was detected in Rondônia (3.5%), Mato Grosso (2.5%), and Pará (0.8%). High prevalence and levels of serological reactivity against the CS repeat peptides of P. falciparum were detected in Rondônia (93%) and Pará (85%). Sera containing antibodies against the CS repeat of P. malariae occurred more frequently in Rondônia (79%), Pará (76%), and Amazonas (68%). Antibodies against the repeat epitope of the standard CS protein of P. vivax VK210, P. vivax VK247, and P. vivax-like were more frequent in Rondônia, Pará, and Mato Grosso. The high frequency of reactions to P. malariae in most of the areas suggests that the infection by this Plasmodium species has been underestimated in Brazil."
CD008122,0,15324463,0,"Role of the prevalent Anopheles species in the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax in Assam state, north-eastern India.","In north-eastern India, Anopheles minimus, An. dirus and An. fluviatilis are considered the three major vectors of the parasites causing human malaria. The role in transmission of the other Anopheles species present in this region is not, however, very clear. To examine the vectorial role of the more common anopheline mosquitoes, the heads and thoraces of 4126 female Anopheles belonging to 16 species (collected using miniature light traps set in human dwellings in a foothill village in the Jorhat district of Assam state) were tested, in ELISA, for the circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum or the VK-210 and VK-247 polymorphs of P. vivax. Sixty-five pools of head-thorax homogenates, representing 10 different species of Anopheles, were found reactive, giving an overall minimum prevalence of infection (MPI) of 1.58%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.21%-2.0%. Among the CSP-reactive pools of mosquitoes, 31% were positive only for P. falciparum, 45% only for P. vivax VK 247, 6% only for P. vivax VK 210, and 18% for both P. falciparum and P. vivax VK 247. The results indicate that not only the proven vector, An. minimus s.l.

R32tet32 contains 32 tandem copies of a tetrapeptide sequence that constitutes the immunodominant epitope of the circumsporozoite surface protein. The magnitude of the antibody response varied considerably among individuals and appeared to be independent of the number of previous clinical infections. Recrudescence of infection or infection with Plasmodium vivax had no demonstrable effect on antibody levels, although reinfection with P. falciparum produced a rapid rise in antibody titer. Antibody levels were observed to decline rapidly after treatment of clinical infection with mefloquine. The apparent antibody half-life was 27 days, which is comparable to the half-life of circulating immunoglobulin G in humans. The data suggest that antisporozoite antibody production ceased on about day 4 after treatment of acute infection. A similar pattern of response was observed for antibodies against the erythrocytic forms of the parasite. The cessation of antibody synthesis was interpreted as being due to immunosuppression induced by the presence of intraerythrocytic parasites and may explain in part why protective immunity is poorly developed in natural malaria infections."
CD008122,0,17568947,0,Anti-malaria humoral responses in children exposed to Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma haematobium.,"Antibody responses directed against the Plasmodium falciparum antigens, total extract, anti-merozoite surface protein-3 (MSP3b) and glutamate-rich protein (Glurp-R0) were studied in 42 children exposed to both Schistosoma haematobium and P. falciparum infections. The association between levels of the anti-malaria IgG subclasses and IgM with host age, sex, schistosome infection intensity and schistosome specific antibodies was studied before chemotherapeutic treatment of schistosome infections. This showed a significant negative association between schistosome infection intensity and levels of IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 directed against malaria total extract antigen, and a positive association between levels of anti-schistosome soluble egg antigen IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 and levels of the same subclasses directed against malaria total extract antigens. The effect of treating schistosome infections with praziquantel on malaria specific responses was also studied. This treatment resulted in increases in significant IgG4 levels against MSP3b and IgM against Glurp R0. Treatment also resulted in a significant decrease in IgG4 levels against Glurp R0. Host age, sex or pre-treatment infection intensity was not associated with the magnitude of change in the two IgG4 responses while males showed a significantly higher increase in levels of IgM. The results suggest cross reactivity between schistosome and malaria antigens in this population."
CD008122,0,9125830,1,Clinical trials of a new immunochromatographic test for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Goa.,"Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2) based immunochromatographic test kit (ICT Malaria Pf) for the rapid diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria was evaluated at the clinic of Malaria Research Centre (Field Station), Goa. Of the 98 febrile patients screened, 22 were ICT positive for P. falciparum. Simultaneous microscopic examination of the blood smears of these ICT positive patients showed that 20 were positive for P. falciparum alone, whereas one had mix infection of both P. vivax and P. falciparum suggesting 100% sensitivity. Only one slide negative patient who had taken 600 mg chloroquine the previous day was positive in the ICT. Out of the remaining 76 blood smears, 41 showed P. vivax infection and none cross-reacted with P. falciparum HRP-2 antigen and were ICT negative except one mix infection case in which P. vivax and P. falciparum infections occurred concomitantly suggesting species specificity of 98.7%. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value and efficacy of the ICT were 95.4, 100 and 98.9% respectively. The band intensity of the ICT positive cases significantly correlated with P. falciparum parasitaemia (p < 0.01). The usefulness and the disadvantages of this diagnostic kit have been discussed in context of prevailing malaria situation in the country."

Antigens also were detected in 12/15 patients who no longer had detectable parasitemia, 3 weeks after chemotherapy. Antigenuria was negative 6 weeks after treatment. By Western blotting, four predominant protein antigens were identified in the urine of patients infected with P. vivax: 200, 180, 150, and 110 kDa. The dot-blot technique may prove to be a rapid and inexpensive method for diagnosing malaria in field studies and for clinical evaluation during chemotherapy."

We evaluated the new combined P. falciparum-P. vivax immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria P.f/P.v.) in Radamata Primary Health Centre, Sumba, Indonesia, from February to May 1998 with 560 symptomatic adults and children with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of malaria. Blinded microscopy was used as the ""gold standard,"" with all discordant and 20% of concordant results cross-checked blindly. Only 50% of those with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of malaria were parasitemic. The ICT Malaria P.f/P.v immunochromatographic test was sensitive (95. 5%) and specific (89.8%) for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria, with a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 88.1 and 96.2%, respectively. HRP2 and panmalarial antigen line intensities were associated with parasitemia density for both species. Although the specificity and NPV for the diagnosis of vivax malaria were 94.8 and 98.2%, respectively, the overall sensitivity (75%) and PPV (50%) for the diagnosis of vivax malaria were less than the desirable levels. The sensitivity for the diagnosis of P. vivax malaria was 96% with parasitemias of >500/microl but only 29% with parasitemias of <500/microl. Nevertheless, compared with the test with HRP2 alone, use of the combined antigen detection test would reduce the rate of undertreatment from 14.7 to 3.6% for microscopy-positive patients, and this would be at the expense of only a modest increase in the rate of overtreatment of microscopy-negative patients from 7.1 to 15. 4%. Cost remains a major obstacle to widespread use in areas of endemicity."
CD008122,0,8665389,1,Parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection in an endemic area in west Uganda.,"The measurement of parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) has been presented as an easy and rapid method for the diagnosis of malaria in humans. In order to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of such a test we examined blood samples from 429 Ugandan patients. While pLDH activity was significantly linked to parasitaemia, sensitivity and specificity were found to be rather low at 58.8 and 62.2% respectively. The positive and negative predictive values failed to meet necessary standards. We conclude that the methods of measurement of pLDH activity in malaria infection, although potentially useful for the fast diagnosis of malaria, need to be improved to be of true value in endemic areas."
CD008122,0,1670842,0,Rapid diagnosis of malaria by fluorescence microscopy with light microscope and interference filter.,"Fluorochrome staining to detect malaria parasites in bloodfilms is more sensitive, is easier to do, and is less time-consuming than Giemsa staining. However, standard epi-illuminated, mercury vapour, fluorescence microscopes are expensive, especially for tropical countries where malaria is endemic. Fluorescence microscopy with a standard light microscope and a new interference filter specially designed for the fluorochrome stain, acridine orange, was used to detect malaria parasites in thick and thin bloodfilms. In this system two fluorescence colours, green (nuclei) and red (cytoplasm), were emitted from stained parasites. Thick and thin bloodfilms from patients with malaria were examined with this system. Bloodfilms had been fixed and stored for 1-5 years. Rapid scanning of both thick and thin bloodfilms was possible at a magnification of x200 with standard lenses, indicating that this may be a useful economic system for rapid diagnosis of malarias."
CD008122,0,9712768,0,"Identification of an erythrocyte binding peptide from the erythrocyte binding antigen, EBA-175, which blocks parasite multiplication and induces peptide-blocking antibodies.","A biotinylated peptide covering a sequence of 21 amino acids (aa) from the erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA-175) of Plasmodium falciparum bound to human glycophorin A, an erythrocyte receptor for merozoites, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to erythrocytes as demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis. The peptide, EBA(aa1076-96), also bound to desialylated glycophorin A and glycophorin B when tested by ELISA. The peptide blocked parasite multiplication in vitro. The glycophorin A binding sequence was further delineated to a 12-aa sequence, EBA(aa1085-96), by testing the binding of a range of truncated peptides to immobilized glycophorin A. Our data indicate that EBA(aa1085-96) is part of a ligand on the merozoite for binding to erythrocyte receptors. This binding suggests that the EBA(aa1085-96) peptide is involved in a second binding step, independent of sialic acid. Antibody recognition of this peptide sequence may protect against merozoite invasion, but only a small proportion of sera from adults from different areas of malaria transmission showed antibody reactivities to the EBA(aa1076-96) peptide, indicating that this sequence is only weakly immunogenic during P. falciparum infections in humans. However, Tanzanian children with acute clinical malaria showed high immunoglobulin G reactivity to the EBA(aa1076-96) peptide compared to children with asymptomatic P. falciparum infections. The EBA(aa1076-96) peptide sequence from EBA-175 induced antibody formation in mice after conjugation of the peptide with purified protein derivative. These murine sera inhibited EBA(aa1076-96) peptide binding to glycophorin A."

Among others, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), discovered in mid of 80'ies and then automatized, offered an attractive alternative to conventional testing systems. In this paper we describe reliable diagnostic tests widely used in the world, including Poland, and capable of detecting different disease agents as parasites and fungi in clinical specimens and pathogens of emerging zoonotic diseases in ticks. The possibilities of using molecular methods for determination of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance is also discussed.

One hundred and thirty-six blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of having malaria were examined by each of the three methods. Forty-four specimens were positive for malaria using microscopy as the ""gold standard"". The sensitivity for nested PCR was 100%, and the specificity was 98%. For the detection of Plasmodium falciparum, the antigen detection method had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97%. Species identification obtained using PCR-RFLP was identical or superior to light microscopy in 42 cases (96%). Although the nested PCR-RFLP method was more sensitive and specific, the rapid turnaround time and high sensitivity of the antigen detection method makes it a useful adjunct to standard microscopy."
CD008122,0,9484972,0,Malaria anticircumsporozoite antibodies in Dutch soldiers returning from sub-Saharan Africa.,"One hundred and twenty-five Dutch servicemen returning from central Africa after a short deployment were enrolled in a study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of malaria prevention measures. None of the persons developed an episode of clinically overt malaria during or after deployment, and no antibodies against blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum could be found. However, antibodies against the circumsporozoite protein (CS) of P. falciparum were demonstrable in 14 persons (11.2% of the study population) by an ELISA test using the recombinant CS-antigen R32tet32, while one person only was positive in an IFA test based on schizonts of P. fieldi as antigen. We concluded that the anti-CS-positive servicemen were probably bitten by mosquitoes carrying P. falciparum parasites while the IFA-positive person was possibly infected by P. vivax, P. ovale or P. malariae parasites. There was no significant association between the different antimalaria preventive measures and the development of anti-CS antibodies. Therefore mefloquine prophylaxis as the single most widely used preventive measure in this group of servicemen was possibly a major contributing factor in averting development of overt malaria."
CD008122,0,12875291,0,Ex vivo interferon-gamma immune response to thrombospondin-related adhesive protein in coastal Kenyans: longevity and risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection.,"Thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) of Plasmodium falciparum is currently being tested in human vaccine studies. However, its natural reactivity in the field remains poorly characterized. More than 40% of 217 Kenyan donors responded in an ex vivo interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay to at least one of 14 20mer peptides spanning 42% of the antigen. Reactivity was comparable from early childhood (>1 year of age) to old age, and the maximal precursor frequency of TRAP-specific cells to all 14 peptides was 1 in 4,000. Prospective follow-up for one year indicated that these low-level ex vivo responses to TRAP did not protect against the subsequent development of malaria. Retesting of selected donors after one year showed a complete change in the reactivity pattern, suggesting that malaria-specific ex vivo IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay responses are short lived in naturally exposed donors, even to conserved epitopes. This study provides important information regarding natural reactivity to a key malaria antigen."
CD008122,0,1377180,0,Mapping of a visceral leishmaniasis-specific immunodominant B-cell epitope of Leishmania donovani Hsp70.,"We have shown that a member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family is a major target of the humoral immune response during Leishmania donovani infection. A recombinant fusion protein was recognized by sera from 92% (35 of 38) of patients with visceral leishmaniasis, including representatives from each of the major regions where it is endemic. Serological analysis of recombinant Hsp70, expressed by a series of deletion constructs, identified the carboxy-terminal region as the immunodominant site. This region, which is the most evolutionarily divergent part of the molecule, was recognized by all sera from patients with visceral leishmaniasis which exhibited an anti-Hsp70 response. Purified recombinant L. donovani Hsp70 was not recognized by sera from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease, leprosy, malaria, or schistosomiasis. To determine the regions involved in antibody recognition, a series of overlapping peptides were synthesized on polyethylene pins by the Pepscan method, and a hexamer, EADDRA, was identified by the visceral leishmaniasis serum samples as an immunodominant B-cell epitope."
CD008122,0,11490988,0,Vector-borne infections in the tropics and health policy issues in the twenty-first century.,"Over the past 2 decades scientific advances and evolving strategies have significantly contributed to improved tools for control of vector-borne infections. These are: diagnostics--rapid assessment methods, non-invasive or minimally so yet sensitive and specific; new chemotherapeutics; pyrethroid insecticides and biological insecticidal products; refined strategies, such as combination therapy, rotation of insecticides for resistance management, community-directed treatment, standardized monitoring and evaluation to define programme progress; better epidemiological knowledge through improved identification of parasites and vectors; GIS, remote sensing and climate models which provide tools for epidemic prediction, planning control programmes and permit effective policy analysis; greater involvement of NGDOs (non-governmental development organizations) and CSOs (civil society organizations) in control; advent of donation programmes which involve community-based or directed mass drug distribution. Future problems could be: (1) the over-emphasis on inflexible financing by the insistence of donors on SWAps (sector-wide investment), (2) the over-reliance on pyrethroid pesticides, (3) the over-expectation that basic research will provide new drugs and vaccines for resource-poor settings in the necessary time scales, and (4) the failure to recognize that biological processes have an inherent capacity for change which outstrips the capacity of health services to respond. Malaria is a paradigm of an 'emerging disease'. (5) The challenge of implementing a 'vertical' approach to disease control within national health programmes, in the face of significant donor opposition to such programmes is a challenge even when such approaches will secure a 'public good'."
CD008122,0,17556615,0,Variant-specific antibodies to merozoite surface protein 2 and clinical expression of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in rural Amazonians.,"Naturally acquired antibodies to five variants of the merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP-2), a target of clinical immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, were measured in a cohort of rural Amazonians. Local MSP-2 variants comprised both highly divergent families of alleles (FC27 and 3D7). Total IgG antibodies to two FC27-type antigens were found in 22-28% of subjects at baseline, with substantial cross-reactivity between variants and stable concentrations and specificities over time. The IgG antibodies to three 3D7-type antigens were less prevalent (6-7%), less cross-reactive, and short-lived; subsequent exposure to 3D7-type parasites rarely elicited homologous response. The clinical spectrum of 109 incident P. falciparum infections in our cohort ranged between asymptomatic infection and fully symptomatic but uncomplicated disease. Parasitemia at the time of diagnosis, rather than cumulative malaria exposure or acquired immunity (presence of variant-specific antibodies matching the MSP-2 type in infecting parasites), was a major predictor of perceived symptom severity."

Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may offer a reliable alternative for case management, but the optimal RDT strategy is uncertain. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)- and plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)-based RDTs, using expert microscopy as the gold standard, in a longitudinal study of 918 fever episodes over an 8-month period in a cohort of children in Kampala, Uganda. Sensitivity was 92% for HRP2 and 85% for pLDH, with differences primarily due to better detection with HRP2 at low parasite densities. Specificity was 93% for HRP2 and 100% for pLDH, with differences primarily due to rapid clearance of pLDH antigenemia after treatment of a previous malaria episode. RDTs may provide an effective strategy for improving rational delivery of antimalarial therapy; in Kampala, either test could dramatically decrease inappropriate presumptive treatments."
CD008122,0,8506119,0,Tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-6 production induced by components associated with merozoite proteins of Plasmodium falciparum.,"P. falciparum merozoite antigens, merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) and rhoptry associated protein-1 (RAP-1), were shown to be liberated into the supernatant of in vitro parasite cultures and to be included in the endotoxin-like exoantigen complex, previously designated Ag7. Material affinity purified from culture supernatants, using immobilized monoclonal antibodies specific for RAP-1 or MSP-1, stimulated normal human mononuclear cells to produce TNF and IL-6 in vitro. However, stimulation of TNF was absent, and that of IL-6 was reduced, when the antigens were purified from detergent extracts of infected erythrocytes. These results indicate that the RAP-1 and MSP-1 proteins themselves do not stimulate the production of TNF. Instead, other components associating with these exoantigens may be responsible for the TNF production. Mouse antisera blocking TNF production stimulated by P. yoelii exoantigens also blocked TNF production stimulated by material affinity purified from P. falciparum culture supernatants using RAP-1 specific monoclonal antibody, indicating the conserved structure of the TNF inducing component."

The numbers of individuals positive by thick blood film examination (TBF) for P. falciparum with or without P. vivax, and P. vivax only were 82 and 69, respectively. The detection limit of ELISA was 10 parasites/10(6) red blood cells (RBC) (0.001% parasitemia). Of 1,095 individuals involved in the study at the beginning of the study, ELISA showed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 78.1%, 94.9%, 72% and 98.1%, respectively. Nine of 18 (50%) TBF-positive but ELISA-positive individuals had parasitemia of less than 10 parasites/10(6) RBC. High and low incidence areas did not affect the validity of our result. Regression analysis showed good correlation between log parasitemia and ELISA percent OD increase (Y = 0 + 64.9*logX, r = 0.65), and agreement between TBF and ELISA results was 95.9%. In a fortnightly follow-up, in 82 TBF-positive individuals, both ELISA and TBF positive rates correlatively declined with agreement of 96.3%. With samples taken on the first day of the study, the TBF and QBC results were also correlated with agreement of 95.8% for P. falciparum, 95.6% for P. vivax. During 8 week follow-up involving altogether 191 samples, agreement between TBF and QBC results were 87.4% for P. falciparum.

CD008122,0,10643909,0,Analysis of Plasmodium falciparum infections in a village community in Northern Nigeria: determination of msp2 genotypes and parasite-specific IgG responses.,"The genetic diversity of P. falciparum and multiplicity of infection has been studied in a village in Northern Nigeria at the end of the rainy season, when transmission is high. We analysed blood samples from 104 individuals aged 5-70 years by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the gene for the merozoite surface protein MSP2 followed by genotyping based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). 94.2% of all samples were parasite positive by PCR and over 80% of those had multiple infections. The age distribution of the average number of parasite clones present in P. falciparum infections showed an initial increase, then reached a peak multiplicity in children 8-10 years of age, and afterwards decreased significantly with age. Mean multiplicity in those 8-10-year-old children was 5.4 clones per carrier. Peak multiplicity and parasite diversity in Nigerian individuals is compared to findings from other study sites in Africa and PNG. The prevalence of IgG antibodies against the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), an indicator for malaria exposure, was over 85% in all age groups showing a high exposure of villagers to P. falciparum. OD values in ELISA were positively correlated with age. There was no correlation between the level of IgG against CSP and the multiplicity of P. falciparum infections determined by PCR of msp2. These results imply that in highly endemic areas multiplicity of infection is not directly correlated with exposure to P. falciparum."

CD008122,0,12831519,0,Serum cytokine profiles in patients with Plasmodium vivax malaria: a comparison between those who presented with and without thrombocytopenia.,"One of the peculiar features of Plasmodium vivax malaria in South Korea is the surprisingly high frequency of thrombocytopenia. The mechanism by which this malaria-related thrombocytopenia develops and its role in the pathology and progress of human infection with P. vivax have not yet been completely understood. In the present study, the serum cytokine profiles of cases of P. vivax malaria who presented with thrombocytopenia were compared with those of similar cases who did not have thrombocytopenia at presentation. The subjects were the 94 consecutive cases of P. vivax malaria who presented at five hospitals in South Korea (all near the Demilitarized Zone) between May 2000 and October 2002, 47 of whom had thrombocytopenia at presentation. When mean values and (S.E.) were compared, the thrombocytopenic patients were found not only to be generally older than the non-thrombocytopenic [25.3 (1.1) v. 21.3 (0.18) years; P < 0.001] but also to have presented with higher serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase [77.6 (16.6) v. 32.3 (7.4) U/litre; P < 0.0001], alanine aminotransferase [96.7 (19.0) v. 44.7 (12.0) U/litre; P = 0.0001], interleukin-1 [49.9 (7.4) v. 23.7 (5.1) pg/ml; P < 0.001], interleukin-6 [174.9 (26.4) v. 57.3 (14.6) pg/ml; P = 0.001], interleukin-10 [308.2 (39.6) v. 137.9 (23.1) pg/ml; P < 0.002] and transforming growth factor-beta [1134.3 (387.5) v. 416.6 (183.8) pg/ml; P < 0.0001], and higher levels of parasitaemia [4345.7 (966.6) v. 1443.8 (222.7) parasites/microl; P = 0.03). The non-thrombocytopenic patients, however, had relatively high total leucocyte counts [5.8 (0.24) v. 5.4 (0.66) leucocytes/nl; P = 0.03]. The thrombocytopenia associated with P. vivax malaria in South Korea therefore appears to be associated with elevated serum concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. To define the role of each cytokine in the development of thrombocytopenia during the course of acute P. vivax malaria, further prospective studies are needed."

There was no difference in tolerance to or side effects of any of the regimens. Within 14 days of starting therapy, therapeutic failure among these patients was 44% for chloroquine, 5% for chloroquine plus primaquine (P < .001), and 0 for halofantrine (P < .001). After 28 days, therapeutic failure was 78%, 15%, and 6%, respectively.

CD008122,0,18279441,0,Antibody responses to a C-terminal fragment of the Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage antigen Pf332 in Senegalese individuals naturally primed to the parasite.,"Previous studies have shown that antibodies from humans exposed continuously to malaria recognize the Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood-stage antigen Pf332. Here we analysed the antibody responses to a C-terminal fragment of Pf332, designated C231, in individuals from Senegal, by measuring the serum levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG class and subclass and IgE antibodies. IgG antibody reactivity with crude P. falciparum antigen was detected in all the donors, while many of the children lacked or had low levels of such antibodies against C231. The antibody levels increased significantly with age for both crude P. falciparum antigen and C231, and in the older age groups most of the donors displayed antibodies to C231. This was also true for IgM, IgE and IgG subclass reactivity against C231. Moreover, the ratio of IgG1/IgG2 was considerably lower for C231 than for crude P. falciparum antigen, and in age groups 10-14 and 15-19 years the levels of IgG2 against C231 even exceeded that of IgG1. The IgG2/IgG3 ratios suggest that C231 gives similar levels of IgG2 and IgG3, except for children aged 4-9 years, where IgG3 was higher. Raw IgM, IgG class and subclass and IgE antibody levels to C231 tended to be higher in those who did not experience a malaria attack, but following linear multivariate analysis the trends were not significant."

CD008122,0,8701258,0,[Role of hepatotropic viruses in liver pathology in Southwestern Cameroon].,"Between 1990 and 1992 (2 years), 102 patients with clinical liver pathology underwent standardized clinical, pathological, sonographic and serologic investigations (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV autoantibodies and tumor markers). During the same period seroepidemiological studies with the same parameters as above were performed on the following control groups: healthy pregnant women (n = 383), blood donors (n = 85), HIV-positive individuals (n = 93), and hospitalized patients in all age groups with minor ailments unrelated to liver pathology (n = 108). The results are discussed in detail. Virtually all adults had HAV infection. HBV and HCV infection appears to play a major role in chronic liver pathology in southern Cameroon. The two infections frequently occur together (over 40% of liver cases) and correlate significantly with liver cirrhosis. The marked prevalence of HBV and HCV markers in healthy pregnant women is of epidemiological concern due to the potential for vertical transmission of the infection (immunization). Endemic infections such as falciparum malaria are probably responsible for unspecific stimulation of the immune system, which is reflected in a generally marked prevalence of autoimmune markers in liver patients and controls, since histologically there was no evidence of autoimmune liver disease."

This practice requires some medical knowledge by mothers who want to treat their children. In Burkina Faso, the main source of the transmission of such knowledge and skills is the interaction between health professionals and mothers during consultations for their children. The main objective of this study was to assess the transfer of knowledge by health professionals to mothers about the causes, symptoms and treatment of malaria in the health district of Nouna, in the province of Kossi, Burkina Faso. The results showed that at the time of the interview very few mothers were able to recognize malaria and treat it adequately. Mothers' lack of malaria-related knowledge and skills was quite substantial and even more pronounced in the sample of mothers from villages. Many did not know the exact cause of malaria or how to treat it. In view of the factors that must be taken into account for the successful treatment of malaria at home (appropriate dose for age, appropriate duration of treatment, appropriate, i.e.,antimalarial, drugs, quality of drugs) it is estimated that only 3.5% of all interviewed mothers had the knowledge necessary to treat malaria correctly at home. Health professionals appeared to agree that the mothers lacked these skills, but our data revealed that they did not provide information to the mothers to address this lack. Specifically, they did not routinely provide information about prevention by mosquito nets, diagnosis based on key symptoms such as fever, the importance of rapid consultation, rules for antimalarial dosing according to age, the risks of under-medication or the dangers related to the purchase and consumption of street drugs that may be counterfeit or have expired."
CD008122,0,14766829,1,Evaluation of the RealArt Malaria LC real-time PCR assay for malaria diagnosis.,"PCR-based methods have advantages over traditional microscopic methods for the diagnosis of malaria, especially in cases of low parasitemia and mixed infections. However, current PCR-based assays are often labor-intensive and not readily quantifiable and have the potential for contamination due to a requirement for postamplification sample handling. Real-time PCR can address these limitations. This study evaluated the performance characteristics of a commercial malaria real-time PCR assay (RealArt Malaria LC Assay; Artus GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) on the LightCycler platform for the detection of malaria parasites in 259 febrile returned travelers. Compared to nested PCR as the reference standard, the real-time assay had a sensitivity of 99.5%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 99.6% for the detection of malaria. Our results indicate that the RealArt assay is a rapid (<45 min), sensitive, and specific method for the detection of malaria in returned travelers."
CD008122,0,18537047,0,"Diagnosis of vivax malaria using an IgM capture ELISA is a sensitive method, even for low levels of parasitemia.","Although diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax malaria has been difficult when it is present at a low parasite density, it was recently revealed that an antibody assay was a good method of screening for malaria in blood banks. However, the use of this method for the diagnosis of malaria is limited due to the persistence of specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G. Therefore, we evaluated specific IgM antibody responses against the C-terminal region of the merozoite surface protein 1 of P. vivax (PvMSP1c) in sera obtained from patients with vivax malaria using various assays. The IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed good sensitivity (97.7%; 308/315) and specificity (99.1%, 446/450). In addition, the results of this assay were not related to parasite density, and a high reactivity was observed when there was a low level of parasitemia. Furthermore, we found that patients with cases of malaria that had relapsed still had the IgM titers against PvMSP1c. Therefore, the use of IgM ELISA for the detection of specific IgM that was not involved in memorial immune activity could be an alternative tool for the diagnosis of malaria and blood screening, even in areas in which malaria is endemic."
CD008122,0,7585070,0,Association of hepatitis B surface antigen carriage with severe malaria in Gambian children.,"Severe malaria is a major cause of childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa but the factors predisposing children to severe forms of malaria have not been fully elucidated. In a case-control study of over 1,200 Gambian children hepatitis B virus carriage was significantly increased amongst cases of severe malaria compared to matched controls. We suggest that this association may relate to impaired clearance of liver stage parasites in the presence of the reduced level of HLA class I antigen expression on hepatocytes infected by hepatitis B virus. If this association is causal and viral carriage predisposes to severe malaria, widespread vaccination against hepatitis B virus may reduce mortality from severe malaria."
CD008122,0,7895836,0,Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax: lactate dehydrogenase activity and its application for in vitro drug susceptibility assay.,"Lactate dehydrogenase, the terminal enzyme of anerobic Embden-Meyerhoff glycolysis, plays an important role in the carbohydrate metabolism of human malaria parasites. Based on the ability of malarial lactate dehydrogenase to use 3-acetylpyridine NAD as a coenzyme in a reaction leading to the formation of pyruvate from L-lactate, the enzymatic activity of fresh clinical isolates of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was determined in relation to incubation time, asexual stages, and parasitemia and applied to a drug susceptibility assay. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was detectable at a parasitemia > 0.4%, at a hematocrit of 1.5%, and increased with parasitemia. Maximal lactate dehydrogenase activity was generally observed between 36 and 48 hr, when the trophozoites and schizonts predominated. The results of the in vitro drug susceptibility assays based on the inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase activity and on the incorporation of tritium-labeled hypoxanthine were correlated. For an optimal performance against fresh clinical malaria isolates, however, the enzymatic assay requires an initial parasitemia between 1 and 2% at a hematocrit of 1.5%."

The printed output is a pictorial emulation of a 96-well plate with the color intensities represented for each reaction. Although the method is presented as a colorimeter computer interfaced system, a provision for manual entry of absorbance values via keyboard is also included. Simulation is based solely on the magnitude of absorbance values. Therefore, it is possible to utilize any enzyme/substrate combination within the range of filters of the colorimeter. We have tested the present system for titration of anti-malarial antibodies in human serum and for the screening of mouse hybridoma culture supernatants."
CD008122,0,1721025,0,Immunogenicity of multiple antigen peptides (MAP) containing T and B cell epitopes of the repeat region of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein.,"The immunogenicity of multiple antigen peptides (MAP) constructs containing T and B cell epitopes of the repeat region of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein was examined in vitro, using a human T cell clone, and in vivo, using four different strains of mice. All the MAP constructs that contained the T cell epitope, (DPNANPNVDPNANPNV), stimulated proliferation and interferon-gamma production by a human T cell clone specific for this epitope which is located in the 5' end of the repeat region of the P. falciparum CS protein. These human T cells did not recognize MAP that contained only the B cell epitope, (NANP)3, which is located in the 3' repeat region. Optimal antibody responses were obtained in mice immunized with MAP containing four copies of tandemly arranged T and B cell epitopes, (TB)4. The murine immune response to the MAP constructs was genetically restricted. Mice of a high responder strain, C57BL, recognized both the 5' and 3' repeat sequences in the MAP as T, as well as B, cell epitopes and developed very high anti-MAP and anti-sporozoite antibody titers. A/J and C3H mice, which were intermediate responders, developed lower antibody titers which varied according to the orientation of the T vs. the B cell epitopes within the MAP constructs. BALB/c mice were nonresponders and did not develop antibodies following immunization with any of the MAP constructs containing the 5' and 3' repeats of the P. falciparum CS protein."
CD008122,0,17172394,0,Sensitivity and specificity of an antigen detection ELISA for malaria diagnosis.,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) allow for the testing of large numbers of samples within a short time frame. We tested the sensitivity and specificity of a histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based, commercially available ELISA antigen detection assay for Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria Antigen CELISA; Cellabs, Sydney, Australia). A total of 700 whole blood samples obtained from symptomatic outpatients of malaria clinics along the Thai-Myanmar border were tested relative to blinded duplicate expert microscopy adjusted with species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR-adjusted microscopy showed that 79 (11.3%) were infected with P. falciparum, 118 (16.9%) with P. vivax, 1 (0.1%) with P. malariae, 7 (1.0%) with mixed infections (P. falciparum and P. vivax), and 495 (70.7%) were negative. The geometric mean parasite density for P. falciparum was 7547/muL (range: 12-363,810/muL). The overall sensitivity of the HRP2 ELISA for P. falciparum malaria was 98.8% (95% CI, 93.6-100%) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI, 99.5-100%). The positive and negative predictive values for the ELISA were 100% (95% CI, 96.5-100%) and 99.8% (95% CI, 99.1-100%), respectively. The results for P. falciparum were clearly superior to expert microscopy alone, particularly in mixed infections. Microscopy combined with ELISA reaches a sensitivity and specificity similar to PCR-adjusted microscopy for the diagnosis of P. falciparum while being considerably less expensive and faster. We conclude that ELISA serves as an excellent tool to augment microscopy as the gold standard for P. falciparum diagnosis in research settings and should be further evaluated for screening in blood banks."
CD008122,0,12924940,0,"Structures of phage-display peptides that bind to the malarial surface protein, apical membrane antigen 1, and block erythrocyte invasion.","Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is synthesized by schizont stage parasites and has been implicated in merozoite invasion of host erythrocytes. Phage-display techniques have recently been used to identify two 15-residue peptides, F1 and F2, which bind specifically to P. falciparum AMA1 and inhibit parasite invasion of erythrocytes [Li, F., et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 50303-50310]. We have synthesized F1, F2, and three peptides with high levels of sequence identity, determined their relative binding affinities for P. falciparum AMA1 with a competition ELISA, and investigated their solution structures by NMR spectroscopy. The strongest binding peptide, F1, contains a beta-turn that includes residues identified via an alanine scan as being critical for binding to AMA1 and inhibition of merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. The three F1 analogues include a 10-residue analogue of F1 truncated at the C-terminus (tF1), a partially scrambled 15-mer (sF1), and a disulfide-constrained 14-mer (F1tbp) which is related to F1 but has a sequence identical to that of a disulfide-constrained loop in the first epidermal growth factor module of the latent transforming growth factor-beta binding protein. tF1 and F1tbp bound competitively with F1 to AMA1, and all three contain a type I beta-turn encompassing key residues involved in F1 binding. In contrast, sF1 lacked this structural motif, and did not compete for binding to AMA1 with F1; rather, sF1 contained a type III beta-turn involving a different part of the sequence. Although F2 was able to bind to AMA1, it was unstructured in solution, consistent with its weak invasion inhibitory effects. Thus, the secondary structure elements observed for these peptides in solution correlate well with their potency in binding to AMA1 and inhibiting merozoite invasion. The structures provide a valuable starting point for the development of peptidomimetics as antimalarial antagonists directed at AMA1."
CD008122,0,12164825,0,Increased levels of interleukin-12 in Plasmodium falciparum malaria: correlation with the severity of disease.,"Interleukin (IL)-12, produced by mononuclear phagocytes, activates the T-helper 1 (Th1) cells and helps, as a mediator, the innate immune response to intracellular microbes. In Plasmodium falciparum infection, this proinflammatory cytokine has immunoregulatory functions with effects on the immune response to the blood stage of disease, but also induces protection and reduces malarial anaemia. In this study, the levels of IL-12 were determined in 73 African children, aged 2-144 months (median 19.5 months), who had severe or mild P. falciparum malaria. IL-12 was determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of IL-12 were found to be significantly elevated (21.6 +/- 18.3 pg/ml) in patients who suffered less severely from the disease. In contrast, the levels of IL-12 were found to be lower (13.1 +/- 7.11 pg/ml) in patients who suffered more severely from the disease."

For P.falciparum, the ICT was 97.5% sensitive and 88% specific, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.6% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.6%. For P.vivax the sensitivity was only 72%, the specificity 99%, with a PPV of 92% and an NPV of 96%. Although a negative test result was inadequate to exclude parasitaemia < or = 300/microl for P.falciparum and < or = 1500/microl for P.vivax, the test is potentially useful in remote areas."

Sixty percent of adults with non-severe malaria had immunoreactive levels of P-selectin above 200 ng/ml (the maximum recorded for any normal healthy adult in the assay) and 86% of all African children with malaria had concentrations above normal irrespective of their clinical categorization, and most exceeded the maximum limits of the assay (> 640 ng/ml). There was no correlation between P-selectin levels and parasitemia. These results raise the possibility that elevated soluble P-selectin in malaria may have an important beneficial anti-inflammatory function."
CD008122,0,1959571,0,Plasmodium falciparum: modulation of surface antigenic expression of infected erythrocytes as revealed by cell fluorescence ELISA.,"The surface reactivity of heterologous immune sera with erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum has been difficult to assess in quantitative terms because of the restricted accessibility of surface epitopes and the lack of sensitive methodologies. In a previous study we showed that cryptic antigens can become exposed on the surface of intact trophozoites if the sterol content of the membranes is increased by means conservative of cell integrity (D. Baruch and Z. I. Cabantchik, Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology 36, 127-138, 1990). In this work we introduce a novel and highly sensitive method of fluorescence cell ELISA for the quantitative estimation of immunoglobulin binding to the surface of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. We obtained that elevation of the membrane sterol content markedly increased the (external) surface accessibility of antigenic epitopes of trophozoites as well as rings of various strains of P. falciparum. This treatment induced exposure of similar epitope(s) on the surface of both rings and trophozoites insofar as preadsorption of sera on sterol-treated cells abolished immunoglobulin binding to either stage of infected erythrocytes (treated or not with sterol). These putative epitopes have relatively low but demonstrable accessibility on the surface of untreated rings but become virtually inaccessible at the trophozoite stage. Application of a large variety of sera (98) to sterol-treated infected cells revealed that almost 70% of the tested sera were found to give positive surface reactivity. Relatively higher intensity of binding was obtained with sera originating from clinically immune individuals. Binding of sera to cells infected with five different P. falciparum strains was essentially indistinguishable, strongly suggesting that elevation of membrane visocity induces surface exposure of cryptic epitopes common to different parasite strains."

In contrast antidrug antibodies were not detected in 7 patients who received the drug for treatment (1.0-1.2 g total over 3 days). The specificity of the IgG response was defined by hapten inhibition experiments (IC50 value for AQ ranged between 0.050 and 0.282 microM) which suggest that the antibody recognised the drug linked to cysteine residues in protein via the 4-hydroxyanilino side chain. The data show that AQ is immunogenic in man and are consistent with the hypothesis that idiosyncratic adverse reactions to the drug have an immunological aetiology.

Sera from malaria endemic areas contain both IgM and IgG antibodies that react with a dominant epitope in the tetrapeptide repeat region of the CS protein. In order to characterize the IgM CS antibody response in Plasmodium falciparum (PF) malaria, a prospective study was conducted in Thai Rangers. Variable IgM responses against the CS protein were detected in 81% of 47 PF-infected subjects. Similar to IgG response kinetics, IgM levels rose to a peak 6-10 days after detection of parasitemia and showed an apparent serum half-life of less than 25 days. The classic difference in isotype ratio (IgG/IgM) between primary and secondary antibody responses was observed to blood-stage, but not CS, antigens."
CD008122,0,8730315,0,Multiple dose pharmacokinetics of oral artemisinin and comparison of its efficacy with that of oral artesunate in falciparum malaria patients.,"The study compared the clinical efficacy and safety of oral artemisinin and oral artesunate as well as artemisinin pharmacokinetics during and after resolution of falciparum malaria. Forty adults with symptomatic falciparum malaria were allocated at random to treatment with either oral artemisinin (500 mg single dose on day 1 followed by 250 mg twice daily for 4 d and then another 500 mg single dose on day 6) or with oral artesunate (100 mg single dose on day 1 followed by 50 mg twice daily for 5 d). Patients were admitted to hospital at the Kibaha Designated District Hospital, Kibaha, Tanzania for the duration of treatment. The patients were seen once weekly for 3 more weeks. The time to parasite clearance (PCT) after oral artesunate (26.4 +/- 3.6 h) was shorter (P = 0.002) than after artemisinin (31 +/- 3.6 h). The fever subsidence time (FST) after oral artesunate (18.9 +/- 4.0 h) was also shorter (P = 0.04) than after artemisinin (21.8 +/- 4.6 h). Parasites were detected in 4 (20%) and 7 (35%) patients after completing treatment with artesunate and artemisinin respectively. In these patients the parasitaemia reappeared at the 3rd or 4th week of follow-up. Standard haematology, blood biochemistry and urinalysis, performed before drug intake and again on days 6 and 14, were normal. No clinical abnormality was observed during the study period. Artemisinin plasma concentrations, determined by high performance liquid chromatography with post-column derivatization and detection by ultraviolet light, were followed up to 8 h after drug administration on days 1 and 6. Artemisinin absorption was rapid, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) being attained at about 3 h. Artemisinin areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the Cmax values were about 6 times higher after the first dose on day 1 than on day 6. This decrease in artemisinin plasma concentration is suggestive of an increase in metabolic capacity due to pronounced autoinduction."
CD008122,0,16504027,0,Are insecticide-treated bednets more protective against Plasmodium falciparum than Plasmodium vivax-infected mosquitoes?,The outcomes of insecticide-treated bednet (ITN) interventions for malaria control in Papua New Guinea tend to suggest a differential protective effect against Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Little is known about the impact of ITNs on the relative abundance of mosquitoes infected with either P. falciparum or P. vivax. This paper describes the biting cycle of P. falciparum and P. vivax-infected mosquitoes and the impact of an ITN intervention on the proportion of mosquitoes infected with either parasite species.
CD008122,0,16100424,0,"Evaluation of the polymerase chain reaction analysis for diagnosis of falciparum malaria in Delhi, India.","Plasmodium falciparum infections are frequently fatal if untreated and hence need to be diagnosed and treated early. Malaria diagnosis, with conventional Giemsa staining as a gold standard, has had several limitations. New rapid and accurate methods are needed for diagnosis. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis specific for diagnosis of P. falciparum was evaluated. For the study, blood samples were collected from 310 patients suspected of having malaria. PCR analysis for P. falciparum from venous blood and at the same time Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears was done. A total of 160 (51.6 %) samples were positive for malarial parasite of which 63 (39.4 %) were positive for P. falciparum by Giemsa staining while 61 (38.1 %) were positive for P. falciparum by PCR analysis. Giemsa staining was time consuming, laborious and may give poor results in cases with low parasitaemia. The PCR analysis for P. falciparum was able to detect 3 cases of low parasitaemia missed initially on Giemsa staining, was 96.8 % sensitive, 100% specific but was very costly, needed a lot of practice and standardization and was time consuming. PCR analysis can be used to supplement the conventional Giemsa staining for reliable diagnosis of falciparum malaria especially in cases with low parasitaemia."
CD008122,0,2602780,0,Pattern of infection in hematologic malignancies: an Indian experience.,"Ninety-nine consecutive patients who received cytotoxic therapy for acute leukemia were retrospectively studied to determine the pattern of infection at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay, India. In all, 224 infective episodes occurred in these patients. Bacterial infection was the commonest type, accounting for 152 (67.9%) of 224 infective episodes, followed by fungal and viral infections (15.6% and 14.3%, respectively). Gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) were the commonest bacterial organisms isolated, constituting 38 (76%) of 50 positive cultures; infection with Staphylococcus was rare (10%). Infective hepatitis, malaria, and systemic tuberculosis were responsible for fever with neutropenia in 20, 4, and 2 patients, respectively. Three hundred fifty-two patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies were also retrospectively studied to determine the pattern of infection. Only 53 infective episodes were recorded. In these patients, in contrast to those with acute leukemia, viral infection (33 [62.3%] of 53) and pulmonary tuberculosis (18 [34%] of 53) were frequently seen. It is interesting that 50% of our patients with hairy cell leukemia also had tuberculosis. Bacterial infection was conspicuous by its absence. Knowledge of the prevailing pattern of infection permits the development of investigative and therapeutic approaches of optimal efficacy."

CD008122,0,7856825,0,Specific and nonspecific responses to Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage parasites and observations on the gametocytemia in schoolchildren living in a malaria-endemic area of Mozambique.,"We have observed specific and nonspecific reactivities to the asexual states and gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum and examined the effect of chloroquine and Fansidar (pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine) on the dynamics of gametocytemia. Schoolchildren peripheral blood films positive for P. falciparum gametocytes were identified in a malaria-endemic area of Mozambique. The children were randomly allocated into two groups to receive chloroquine or pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine, and were followed for 28 days after treatment. In patients harboring drug-sensitive parasites, asexual parasitemias were cleared by day 4, but gametocytes persisted for an additional 17 days. The prevalence of the asexual parasites was 67.6% in the chloroquine-treated group at day 0 and 61.1% at day 28, whereas in the pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine treated group, the initial parasite prevalence of 70.7% was reduced to 2.4% at day 28, suggesting a high prevalence of chloroquine-resistant parasites. On day 0, gametocyte prevalence was 59.5% in the chloroquine-treated group and in 68.3% in the pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine-treated group; these values were reduced to 5.6% and 2.4%, respectively, at day 28. Our results suggest strongly that there is no induction of gametocytogenesis by either course of chemotherapy."

CD008122,0,16174539,0,Microarray-based comparative genomic analyses of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using Affymetrix arrays.,"Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) provides a powerful tool for whole genome analyses and the rapid detection of genomic variation that underlies virulence and disease. In the field of Plasmodium research, many of the parasite genomes that one might wish to study in a high throughput manner are not laboratory clones, but clinical isolates. One of the key limitations to the use of clinical samples in CGH, however, is the miniscule amounts of genomic DNA available. Here we describe the successful application of multiple displacement amplification (MDA), a non-PCR-based amplification method that exhibits clear advantages over all other currently available methods. Using MDA, CGH was performed on a panel of NF54 and IT/FCR3 clones, identifying previously published deletions on chromosomes 2 and 9 as well as polymorphism in genes associated with disease pathology."
CD008122,0,7856827,0,Humoral response to Plasmodium falciparum ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen in a highly endemic area of Papua New Guinea.,"The prevalence and concentration of antibodies to ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) were measured in blood samples collected during a cross-sectional survey conducted in Papua New Guinea. Antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to the recombinant RESA protein in 1,398 subjects and to RESA 8 and RESA 11 synthetic peptides in a subsample of 200 adults. Overall, the seropositivity rate to recombinant RESA was 66% and the geometric mean antibody concentration was 28 micrograms/ml. There was a slow increase in antibody prevalence and concentration with age that continued to occur even after 40 years of age. In children less than 10 years of age, there was a significant positive correlation between both RESA antibody prevalence and concentration and concurrent infection with Plasmodium falciparum. The opposite was true in adults more than 20 years of age, with those having a high antibody concentration to RESA being less likely to be parasitemic at the time of the survey. This observation was consistent with the finding of a weak but significant negative correlation between log antibody concentration and log P. falciparum density, which was mainly found in adults. No consistent correlation was found between humoral immune response to RESA and morbidity indicators."
CD008122,0,10391861,0,Diagnostic and prognostic potential of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for leishmaniasis in India.,"A Leishmania donovani species-specific monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody D2) was evaluated for its diagnostic and prognostic potential by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA) in sera from Indian patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and seven patients with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). These results were compared with those obtained by microscopy with Giemsa-stained tissue smears and a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (direct ELISA) with crude parasite antigen. Of 121 patients with clinically diagnosed VL examined, 103 (85.1%) were positive and 11 (9.1%) were negative by all three methods. An additional 7 (5.8%) who were negative by microscopy were positive by both C-ELISA and direct ELISA. Seven PKDL patients were also examined and were found to be positive by all three methods. Analysis of the chemotherapeutic response to sodium antimony gluconate of these 110 serologically positive VL patients showed that 57 (51.8%) were drug responsive and 53 (48.2%) were drug resistant. The C-ELISA with sera from 20 longitudinally monitored VL patients before and after chemotherapy showed a significant decrease in percent inhibition of monoclonal antibody D2 in drug-responsive patients. However, in drug-unresponsive patients, the percent inhibition of D2 was unchanged or was slightly increased. Our results therefore indicate (i) the applicability of L. donovani species-specific monoclonal antibody D2 for sensitive and specific serodiagnosis by C-ELISA, (ii) that the C-ELISA is more sensitive than microscopy, especially for early diagnosis, (iii) that L. donovani is still the main causative agent of VL, irrespective of the chemotherapeutic response, and (iv) that the C-ELISA can be used to evaluate the success of drug treatment."
CD008122,0,7856826,0,A comparison of transmission-blocking activity with reactivity in a Plasmodium falciparum 48/45-kD molecule-specific competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 32F1 and 32F3 react with two independent epitopes of a protein doublet with molecular weights of 48 and 45 kilodaltons (kD) expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum (Pfs48/45) macrogametes and zygotes; only 32F3 blocks transmission. These MAbs were used to develop a Pfs48/45-specific competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using 32F1 to capture antigen and labeled 32F3 for quantification and analysis of the contribution of antibodies in human serum to transmission-blocking activity. A comparison analysis was used to determine agreement of competition ELISA titers and transmission-blocking activity as observed in the bioassay in three groups of serum samples: 37 from European travelers with previous exposure to malaria, 56 from gametocyte carriers, and 66 from schoolchildren from a malaria-endemic area in Cameroon. The index of agreement between outcomes of the ELISA and transmission-blocking assay in gametocyte carriers and in travelers was specifically defined as fair-to-moderate; in schoolchildren the agreement was not significant. The combined analysis of all sera showed a significant and fair-to-moderate agreement between the results of the competition ELISA and the transmission-blocking assay, with a relative specificity of 94% (of 105 cases negative in the transmission-blocking assay, 99 were also negative in the competition ELISA) and a relative sensitivity of 44% (of 54 cases positive in the transmission-blocking assay, 24 were also positive in the competition ELISA). This study shows that a positive C48/45-ELISA is indicative for transmission-blocking activity in the mosquito assay, while a negative result does not exclude transmission-blocking activity."

CD008122,0,15117307,0,Rapid epidemiologic assessment of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in malaria-endemic areas in Southeast Asia using a novel diagnostic kit.,"We recently reported a new rapid screening method for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This method incorporates a new formazan substrate (WST-8) and is capable of detecting heterozygous females both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here, we report its evaluation during field surveys at three malaria centres and in malaria-endemic villages of Myanmar and Indonesia, either alone or in combination with a rapid on-site diagnosis of malaria. A total of 57 severe (45 males and 12 females) and 34 mild (five males and 29 females) cases of G6PD deficiency were detected among 855 subjects in Myanmar whilst 30 severe (25 males and five females) and 23 mild (six males and 17 females) cases were found among 1286 subjects in Indonesia. In all cases, severe deficiency was confirmed with another formazan method but due to limitations in its detection threshold, mild cases were misdiagnosed as G6PD-normal by this latter method. Our results indicate that the novel method can qualitatively detect both severely deficient subjects as well as heterozygous females in the field. The antimalarial drug, primaquine, was safely prescribed to Plasmodium vivax-infected patients in Myanmar. Our new, rapid screening method may be essential for the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency particularly in rural areas without electricity, and can be recommended for use in malaria control programmes."

CD008122,0,12167093,0,The economic payoffs of integrated malaria control in the Zambian copperbelt between 1930 and 1950.,"It has long been suggested that malaria is delaying the economic development of countries that are most severely affected by the disease. Several studies have documented the economic consequences of malaria at the household level, primarily in communities engaged in subsistence farming. A missing element is the appraisal of the economic impact of malaria on the industrial and service sectors that will probably become the backbone of many developing economies. We estimate the economic effects of integrated malaria control implemented during the colonial period and sustained for 20 years in four copper mining communities of the former Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Integrated malaria control was characterized by strong emphasis on environmental management, while part of the mining communities also benefited from rapid diagnosis and treatment and the use of bednets. The programmes were highly successful as an estimated 14,122 deaths, 517,284 malaria attacks and 942,347 work shift losses were averted. Overall, 127,226 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were averted per 3-year incremental period. The cumulative costs of malaria control interventions were 11,169,472 US dollars (in 1995 US dollars). Because the control programmes were so effective, the mining companies attracted a large reservoir of migrant labourers and sustained healthy work forces. The programmes averted an estimated 796,622 US dollars in direct treatment costs and 5,678,745 US dollars in indirect costs as a result of reduced work absenteeism. Within a few years of programme initiation, Northern Rhodesia became the leading copper producer in Africa, and mining generated the dominant share of national income. Copper production and revenues, which increased dramatically during malaria control interventions, amounted to the equivalent of 7.1 billion US dollars (in 1995 US dollars). Integrated malaria control in copper mining communities was a sound investment. It had payoff for public and occupational health, generally, and without it copper extraction and social and economic development would have been impossible."
CD008122,0,16055071,0,Variation in the relationship between anti-MSP-1(19) antibody response and age in children infected with Plasmodium falciparum during the dry and rainy seasons.,"Malaria remains a major parasitic disease in Africa, with 300-500 million new infections each year. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of new effective measures, including vaccines. Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1(19) (MSP-1(19)) is a prime candidate for a blood-stage malaria vaccine. Blood samples were collected from children aged 10 days to 15 years in the months of January-March (N = 351) and October-November (N = 369) corresponding to the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. P. falciparum infection was determined by microscopy and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the total IgG and IgG subclasses. There was a significant increase in the mean anti-MSP-1(19) antibody titre in the dry season (p < 0.05), compared to the rainy season. A significantly positive correlation between the anti-MSP-1(19) antibody titre and parasite density (p < 0.01, r = 0.138) was observed. In the rainy season, unlike in the dry season, P. falciparum positive children had higher anti-MSP-1(19) antibody titres than P. falciparum negative children and this difference was significant (p < 0.05). When all individuals were grouped together, the anti-MSP-1(19) antibody titre increased with age in both seasons (r = 0.186 and 0.002), this increase was more apparent in the dry season. However, when the study population was divided into P. falciparum positive and negative groups, it was observed that in the rainy season, there was a negative correlation between anti-MSP-1(19) titre and age in P. falciparum positive individuals, while those who were P. falciparum negative had a positive correlation between anti-MSP-1(19) titre and age. Analysis of anti-MSP-1(19) IgG subclass showed that IgG1 and IgG3 mean titres were highest in both the dry and rainy seasons with an increase in the mean antibody titres for IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 in the rainy season. In the dry season there was a positive correlation between IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 titres with age, while IgG4 was negative, whereas in the rainy season there was a positive correlation between IgG2 and IgG4 (non-cytophilic antibodies) with age and a negative correlation for IgG1 and IgG3 (cytophilic antibodies) with age. Seasonal differences in the level of MSP-1(19) IgG subclass titres were observed for P. falciparum negative and positive individuals. Only samples, which were positive for IgG2 and IgG4, showed positive correlation between parasitemia and total IgG. The incidence of P. falciparum infection, which increases during the rainy season, might be an important determinant of anti-MSP-1(19) antibody levels in children living in Igbo-Ora and the results point to the fact that non-cytophilic antibodies to MSP-1(19) in children might be associated with an increase in total IgG and parasitemia."
CD008122,0,1443339,0,Antibodies to the major merozoite surface coat protein of Plasmodium falciparum (gp195) in a human population living in a malaria-endemic area of the Philippines.,"The seroprevalence of naturally acquired antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein gp195 was assessed in 726 individuals living in the Napsan region of Palawan in The Philippines. Antibodies against gp195 were detected using parasite-derived antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The lowest seroprevalence of anti-gp195 antibodies (45%) was found in the 0-4-year-old age group. By 10-19 years of age, the seroprevalence of anti-gp195 antibodies had leveled off at approximately 90%. Anti-gp195 antibody titers were determined for 59 randomly selected individuals using parasite-derived gp195 and two yeast recombinant polypeptides corresponding to the N-terminal (195A) and C-terminal (p42) processing fragments of gp195. For each antigen, the lowest antibody titers were found in the 0-4-year-old age group. The 5-9-year-old age group had anti-gp195 antibody titers comparable with the older age groups. Immunoblotting experiments with parasite-derived gp195 revealed that all serum samples tested had detectable antibodies to the 195-kD gp195 precursor molecule and the 83-kD N-terminal processing fragment. Individuals with anti-gp195 titers greater than 1:400 had antibodies against both the N-terminal and C-terminal processing fragments of gp195. These results suggest that the gp195 C-terminal region may be less immunogenic than the N-terminal region when presented on the parasite surface during natural malaria infections."
CD008122,0,8867062,0,Application of simple peptide ELISA for stratification of malaria endemicity.,"A serological investigation was conducted in north India to determine malaria endemicity based on the antibody levels against a nonapeptide RI (EENVEHDA-Cys) from the P. falciparum antigen Pf 155/RESA. P. falciparum sonicated crude antigen was also used in the study. Subjects of all age groups from various strata of malaria endemicity were included in this study. A total of 4273 finger prick blood samples from 49 villages of five districts were collected during January to March 1991 which is a non-transmission season and the antibody levels were estimated by ELISA. Although a good correlation was found between the antibody titre to the RI peptide and that to the crude antigen, the most consistent results were obtained with the RI peptide. When compared with the annual parasite index (API) values, an established method for defining malaria endemicity, mean anti-RI antibody titres obtained from several villages within a single zone correlated (r = 0.94, p = 0.023) with mean API value of the area. Thus, our results suggest that by using the RI peptide as antigen in seroepidemiology, it is possible to stratify malaria endemicity. We didn't distinguish between endemicity of Pv and Pf since each area experiences cycle of transmission of P. vivax followed by P. falciparum and our sera were from individuals having no fever."
CD008122,0,8057374,0,Characterization of a Plasmodium vivax cysteine proteinase gene identifies uniquely conserved amino acids that may mediate the substrate specificity of malarial hemoglobinases.,"The gene encoding a cysteine proteinase of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax has been identified and characterized. The sequence predicted by the proteinase gene shares several unique features with the sequences of two recently characterized cysteine proteinases of other malarial species. These features include the conservation of a number of amino acids that are predicted, based on a recently devised model for the related Plasmodium falciparum cystine proteinase, to be located near the enzyme's active site. We hypothesize that these residues have been conserved to maintain optimal proteolytic specificity in the hydrolysis of globin by malaria parasites."
CD008122,0,6359905,0,Specificities of antibodies boosted by acute Plasmodium falciparum infection in man.,"In the search for antibodies correlating with host-protective immunity to Plasmodium falciparum in man, sera from individuals in Papua New Guinea were analyzed at the time of infection and in the convalescent period following infection. Titers of antibody were determined by enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA), and the specificities of antibodies was examined by gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates. In the majority of cases, convalescence was associated with an increase in antibody titer and one-dimensional gel analysis of immunoprecipitated biosynthetically labeled parasite antigens demonstrated the variability in specificity of the antibody response in the two types of serum samples from different individuals. A protein of Mr 96,000 which has previously been identified as a candidate host-protective antigen was not clearly seen in immunoprecipitates generated with acute serum, even in samples with high titers of antibody assessed by ELISA. Antibodies to a protein Mr 96,000 were present in some, but not all convalescent sera. Two-dimensional gel analysis was more sensitive in detecting a boost in antibody response to minor antigens (e.g., an acidic protein Mr approximately equal to 230,000). This approach has not led to identification of antibody specificities to major antigens which are invariably boosted by infection and drug cure, but has identified antibody specificities in acute sera which are inadequate in quantity or quality to inhibit parasite growth."
CD008122,0,6359904,0,"Evaluation of amodiaquine treatment of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria on Zanzibar, 1982.","Amodiaquine, a 4-aminoquinoline which has been shown to be effective in treating infections with chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, was evaluated against chloroquine-resistant infections in children in Zanzibar, Tanzania, during July 1982. A 25-mg base/kg dosage of amodiaquine produced parasite clearance in 34 of 38 (89%) children in a mean of 2.8 days. When followed for 28 days, 15 of 38 (39%) children were completely cured of their infection as judged by the absence of renewed parasitemia. The parasite clearance rates produced by amodiaquine were significantly higher than those observed in a comparison group of children treated with 25 mg base/kg chloroquine. There was, however, no difference in the cure rates in the chloroquine and amodiaquine groups. Despite the enhanced parasite clearance rate, amodiaquine is not sufficiently more effective against Zanzibari strains of P. falciparum to replace chloroquine. Other alternative drugs must be evaluated to define the optimal malaria therapy regimen on Zanzibar."
CD008122,0,7529717,0,Plasmodium falciparum: a comparison of the activity of Pfs230-specific antibodies in an assay of transmission-blocking immunity and specific competition ELISAs.,"The activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically recognize the Plasmodium falciparum sexual stage-specific protein Pfs230 was analyzed. All mAbs reacted with the surface of extracellular sexual forms of the parasite in a suspension immunofluorescence antibody reaction and precipitated the Pfs230 protein from an NP-40 extract of surface radioiodinated macrogametes/zygotes. Only mAb that bound complement blocked transmission, whereas mAb that did not bind complement but competed with the complement-binding mAb for binding to the same epitope did not block transmission. These mAbs were used to develop Pfs230-specific competition ELISAs to analyze epitope diversity and to analyze the binding characteristics of anti-Pfs230 antibodies in human serum. Transmission-blocking (TB) antibodies in test/field sera competed in the competition ELISA for binding with epitope-specific, labeled mAbs against Pfs230. At least five different epitope regions could be defined with the competition ELISAs. All 46 sera from gametocyte carriers immunoprecipitated the Pfs230 molecule, while 19 of these sera blocked transmission in the bioassay. Five of the transmission-blocking and one of the nonblocking sera competed with monoclonal antibodies. A method comparison analysis was used to determine agreement between reactions in a competitive ELISA and the TB activity examined in the bioassay. The index of agreement kappa between outcomes of the bioassay and ELISA was fair to poor (kappa = 0.25) but since its range includes values below 0 the relation between the data obtained by the bioassay and the competition ELISA can be explained by chance alone. The serological data did not reveal a correlation between immunoprecipitation of Pfs230 and TB activity."

In addition to 176 slide-proven imported cases of Plasmodium vivax, 94 other persons reactive serologically but no patent parasitemia was found. Slide and serologic results indicated that the dominant malaria species involved was P. vivax. Seven patients who were both serologically and parasite negative when first tested subsequently reported with patent parasitemia and high antibody titer. One of these quiescent cases had resided in the United States at least 7 months prior to the first negative serology, and for some period thereafter before development of parasitemia and antibody response. Serologic results indicated that some persons had had contact with P. falciparum. When parasitemia is rapid in onset and serum is taken immediately, serologic response may be lacking. For detection of presumptive malaria infections, serology may have certain advantages not available with slide examinations. Blood slide examination and malaria serology are used to best advantage together, but either may be valuable in itself, alone, in efforts toward case detection and transmission control in hypoendemic malaria."
CD008122,0,18031779,1,Assessment of three new parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pan-pLDH) tests for diagnosis of uncomplicated malaria.,"A study to assess the diagnostic capabilities of three parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pan-pLDH) tests, Vistapan), Carestart and Parabank), was conducted in Uganda. An HRP2 test, Paracheck-Pf), and a Giemsa-stained blood film were performed with the pLDH tests for outpatients with suspected malaria. In total, 460 subjects were recruited: 248 with positive blood films and 212 with negative blood films. Plasmodium falciparum was present in 95% of infections. Sensitivity above 90% was shown by two pLDH tests, Carestart (95.6%) and Vistapan (91.9%), and specificity above 90% by Parabank (94.3%) and Carestart (91.5%). Sensitivity decreased with low parasitaemia (chi(2) trend, P<0.001); however, all tests achieved sensitivity >90% with parasitaemia > or =100/microl. All tests had good inter-reader reliability (kappa>0.95). Two weeks after diagnosis, 4-10% of pLDH tests were still positive compared with 69.7% of the HRP2 tests. All tests had similar ease of use. In conclusion, two pLDH tests performed well in diagnosing P. falciparum malaria, and all pLDH tests became negative after treatment more quickly than the HRP2. Therefore the rapid test of choice for use with artemisinin-combination therapies in this area would be one of these new pLDH tests."
CD008122,0,16913523,0,[Scientific standards in parasitology in historical perspective].,"An analysis of scientific standards in parasitology was carried out from the perspective of anthropology of knowledge - a new discipline that emerged from non-classical history science in the 1990s. The history of parasitology, its development and limitations, are presented in a broad socio-cultural context, as the answers of scientists to different social needs in historical periods. In parasitological history there are some periods characteristic for all newly emerging disciplines of natural science. The first systematic account of natural phenomena and their interpretations was initiated in the 16th century and continued till the mid 18th century. It was a period when the phenomena could not be explained in a proper way by the existing and accepted theories. The epidemic diseases were one of these phenomena which were interpreted based on ancient ideas, mostly humoral pathology. In the 16th century a new contagium concept of material factors (pathogenes) that could be spread by contact among humans or close association was formed. This hypothesis, however, was not widely accepted because it contradicted the well-established normative concepts in the European academic naturalism. The development of parasitology was stopped because of theoretical barriers and interpretation difficulties (non-materialistic standard of naturalism, humoral pathology and spontaneous theory). In the second half of the 18th century, the theoretical crisis in natural sciences gave a new impulse for many disciplines; among others, parasitology entered in its second stage of development. The collected observations were classified in a new way and in the context of new interpretations. The progress in parasitology was prompted by the intensified urbanization, rapid increase of European population as well as by wars connected with infections and epidemics. It resulted in two competitive research programs (the French and the German). On the basis of the same observations, they advanced different theoretical interpretations. The third period in the history of parasitology lasted from the mid 19th century to the end of World War I. At that time a common agreement was established in all Europe, with regard to interpretation of standards inspired by positivism, i.e. verification of empirical statements through observation. Parasitology emerged as a separate discipline. Theoretical barriers limiting its progress and setting the questions were overcome. The contagion concept was reinstated. The colonial conquests solving demography problem provided the most important social impulse for the progress in parasitology. It was supported by governments interested in having their colonies free from diseases, mainly malaria and other tropical diseases, and thus safe for the European pioneer settlers. There was also development of parasitological scientific institutions (institutes of tropical medicine) and didactics. After World War I parasitology entered the fruitful stage of discipline development which resulted in a division into subdisciplines and a progress of new scientific fields. Its theoretical standards have become fixed and provided a basis for preventive programmes against parasite diseases, supported financially by European goverments, USA and some other countries. Those programmes were executed both in the home countries and in the colonies. After World War II, in the fourth stage of parasitology development, attention was mainly paid to local natural environment in order to diagnose parasites and their vectors. At the same time, parasitology became an applied science practiced in many specialized centres not only at universities. Presently, the main aims of parasitology are studies on biodiversity of parasites and environmental protection in the developed countries, and within tropical medicine as the travel medicine, because of rapid increase of tourism."
CD008122,0,12435448,0,"Malaria associated anaemia, drug resistance and antimalarial combination therapy.","Malaria associated anaemia represents a major cause of childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Prevention of severe anaemia necessitates rapid treatment of symptomatic high density parasitaemia, as well as reduction of asymptomatic parasite prevalence to provide recovery period to restore production of erythrocytes. Both interventions are being increasingly impaired by reduced efficacy of antimalarial treatment due to parasite drug resistance. A new treatment strategy, including combinations of antimalarial drugs with optimal pharmacodynamic and kinetic properties may respond to the need of rapid and radical parasite clearance, temporary protection to re-infection, and prevention of drug resistance."
CD008122,0,18831737,0,Impact of training in clinical and microscopy diagnosis of childhood malaria on antimalarial drug prescription and health outcome at primary health care level in Tanzania: a randomized controlled trial.,Prescribing antimalarial medicines based on parasite confirmed diagnosis of malaria is critical to rational drug use and optimal outcome of febrile illness. The impact of microscopy-based versus clinical-based diagnosis of childhood malaria was assessed at primary health care (PHC) facilities using a cluster randomized controlled training intervention trial.
CD008122,0,2692219,0,Comparison of antibody responses to the circumsporozoite protein repeat region and to intact sporozoites during acute falciparum malaria.,"Most acute falciparum malaria patients mount an antibody response to the circumsporozoite (CS) protein which contains a dominant B-cell epitope. In order to investigate whether antibodies against other epitopes on the sporozoite surface may be important during a particular phase of infection or convalescence, we longitudinally studied the antibody responses of 13 Thai patients with acute falciparum malaria. Antibody comparisons were made using intact Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in an indirect fluorescent antibody test and the recombinant peptide, R32tet32, as capture antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody response curves derived using the 2 methods were similar, and adsorption with R32tet32 greatly (greater than 95%) diminished anti-sporozoite activity in sera. Thus, peptide constructs containing the CS repeat region epitope, (NANP)n, can be used with confidence to assay anti-sporozoite antibodies, independent of both the time of infection and prior malaria history."
CD008122,0,7937907,0,Protection against malaria by immunization with plasmid DNA encoding circumsporozoite protein.,"Immunization with irradiated sporozoites protects animals and humans against malaria, and the circumsporozoite protein is a target of this protective immunity. We now report that adjuvant-free intramuscular injection of mice with plasmid DNA encoding the Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein induced higher levels of antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes against the P. yoelii circumsporozoite protein than did immunization with irradiated sporozoites. Mice immunized with this vaccine had an 86% reduction in liver-stage parasite burden after challenge with 5 x 10(5) sporozoites (> 10(5) median infectious doses). Eighteen (68%) of 28 mice that received two or three doses of vaccine were protected against challenge with 10(2) sporozoites, and the protection was dependent on CD8+ T cells. These studies demonstrate the utility of plasmid DNA immunization against a nonviral infection. By obviating the requirement for peptide synthesis, expression and purification of recombinant proteins, and adjuvants, this method of immunization provides an important alternative for rapid identification of protective B- and T-cell epitopes and for construction of vaccines to prevent malaria and other infectious diseases."
CD008122,0,6354641,0,Rapid identification and detection of parasitized human red cells by automated flow cytometry.,"Rapid and reliable identification of various human red cells parasites is important in many chemotherapeutic and immunologic studies. Because manual microscopic counting is tedious and imprecise, we have developed a simple diagnostic procedure for the automated flow cytometric detection of in vitro infected red cells, using a nucleic acid-binding fluorescent dye, acridine orange. Human malaria (Plasmodium falciparum)-infected red cells from continuous human erythrocyte culture were incubated at room temperature in acridine orange stain for 5 min after which the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Since mature red cells contain no DNA, infected red cells were identified with a distinct fluorescent signal. A total of 200,000 cells per sample were counted and analyzed in less than 2 min. Rings, trophozoites, and schizonts were assessed and identified in synchronized infected red cell cultures by flow cytometry. In addition, various stages of infected red cells were isolated with a cell sorter. This rapid method permits accurate and reliable assessment of data with the exclusion of anomalous data such as damaged cells, extraneous material, and contaminating particles."
CD008122,0,3319260,0,[Current aspects of imported drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum].,"24 cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a group of 73 non-immune subjects coming mostly from central Africa have been tested in vitro for chloroquine sensitivity: 5 are sensitive, 19 are resistant among whom one is also quinine-resistant. The comparison of the major clinical and biological features in the two groups by methods of statistical calculation shows that the parasitological diagnosis is retarded and that hemolysis is more frequent in the strains of Plasmodium falciparum resistant to chloroquine. Thrombopenia is more frequent with chemosensitives strains. In any case, the delay between the first symptoms and the parasitological diagnosis is increased with an average of 17 days in comparison to what was observed in the 1970's. Under the influence of several complex factors including human ones, the clinical aspects are changed in comparison to forms usually observed. In this context of an extension of the emergence of the chemoresistance and in the aim of efficiency, only the quinine I.V., with an average dose of 16.5 mg/kg per day of quinine-base, has been chosen as a curative treatment during 5 days allowing a rapid recovery without after-effects for all the cases."
CD008122,0,19384681,0,Internally displaced human resources for health: villager health worker partnerships to scale up a malaria control programme in active conflict areas of eastern Burma.,"Approaches to expand malaria control interventions in areas of active conflict are urgently needed. Despite international agreement regarding the imperative to control malaria in eastern Burma, there are currently no large-scale international malaria programmes operating in areas of active conflict. A local ethnic health department demonstrated that village health workers are capable of implementing malaria control interventions among internally displaced persons (IDPs). This paper describes how these internally displaced villagers facilitated rapid expansion of the programme. Clinic health workers received training in malaria diagnosis and treatment, vector control and education at training sites along the border. After returning to programme areas inside Burma, they trained villagers to perform an increasingly comprehensive set of interventions. This iterative training strategy to increase human resources for health permitted the programme to expand from 3000 IDPs in 2003 to nearly 40,000 in 2008. It was concluded that IDPs are capable of delivering essential malaria control interventions in areas of active conflict in eastern Burma. In addition, health workers in this area have the capacity to train community members to take on implementation of such interventions. This iterative strategy may provide a model to improve access to care in this population and in other conflict settings."
CD008122,0,16954261,0,Development of a PCR assay followed by nonradioactive hybridization using oligonucleotides covalently bound to CovaLink NH microwells for detection of four Plasmodium species in blood samples from humans.,"We developed and evaluated a PCR-based assay to detect four Plasmodium species in 79 blood samples from 56 travelers returning from areas where malaria is endemic. DNA amplification targeting a small region of the 18S rRNA gene was performed with Plasmodium genus-specific primers. The biotinylated PCR products were then identified by PCR-colorimetric Covalink NH microwell plate hybridization (CMPH) using species-specific phosphorylated probes covalently bound to a pretreated polystyrene surface. The results from PCR-CMPH showed high specificity, and for 47 of the 56 patients (84%), microscopy and PCR-CMPH results were in agreement. Discordant results were reevaluated with microscopy examination, other molecular methods, and DNA sequencing. Except for one patient, discrepancies were resolved in favor of PCR-CMPH: three mixed infections were detected, four species identification errors were corrected, and two negative results were shown to be positive. Our results indicate that PCR-CMPH is a simple, rapid, and specific method for malaria diagnosis. It employs stable reagents and inexpensive equipment, making it suitable for routine epidemiological use."
CD008122,0,18226243,0,Pilot assessment of the sensitivity of the malaria thin film.,"Malaria microscopy remains the reference standard for malaria diagnosis in clinical trials (drug and vaccine), new diagnostic evaluation, as well as in clinical care in much of the world today. It is known that microscopy is an imperfect gold standard, and that very low false positive rates can dramatically lower protective efficacy estimates in malaria prevention trials. Although new methods are now available, including malaria rapid diagnostic tests and PCR, neither is as yet validated in the clinical trial setting and both have limitations. Surprisingly, the sensitivity of thin smears is not well established and thin smears are not commonly used in the developing world."
CD008122,0,15000726,1,Comparison of the OptiMAL rapid antigen test with field microscopy for the detection of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum: considerations for the application of the rapid test in Afghanistan.,"To establish the sensitivity and specificity of a batch of 'OptiMAL 48' rapid antigen tests procured by the World Health Organization in Afghanistan, a sample was tested, in parallel with routine, microscopical diagnosis, at basic health units (BHU) within Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan. The results of both methods of field diagnosis were compared with those of cross-checking microscopy at a reference laboratory, which were taken as the 'gold standard'. Out of 499 patients examined, 36% were diagnosed as malaria cases by field microscopy and 34% by the rapid test. For the OptiMAL 48 test, cross-checking of the corresponding smears at the reference laboratory gave a sensitivity of 79.3% and a specificity of 99.7% for Plasmodium falciparum and corresponding values of 86.1% and 98.7% for P. vivax infections. The performance of the field microscopy was better, with a sensitivity and specificity of 85.2% and 99.7% for P. falciparum, and 90.4% and 98.7% for P. vivax, respectively. These results show that the performance of OptiMAL 48 is adequate for acute- and post-emergency situations when the alternative is just clinical diagnosis. However, in the developing health system of Afghanistan, the main focus should be on the expansion of the existing network for microscopical diagnosis and quality control, to meet the needs of a stable situation. Rapid antigen tests are more suited to investigations of outbreaks in remote situations, where health services are deficient or absent."
CD008122,0,2111943,0,Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites following a malarial outbreak in a non-endemic area of Sri Lanka.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the synthetic peptide (NANP)40 was used to characterize the sporozoite antibodies in an unusual Plasmodium falciparum outbreak in a non-malarious area in Sri Lanka. A positive antibody response was seen in 62% of patients with their first P. falciparum illness. There was no correlation between sporozoite antibodies and the antibody against blood stages, determined by immunofluorescence assay. The majority (91%) of the patients lost the antibodies to circumsporozoite (CS) protein within one year (in the absence of re-exposure). Three patients had high levels of CS antibodies even after one year, and this persistence was related to the level of the initial antibody response. In the area of the outbreak 10% of schoolchildren had antibodies to the (NANP)40 peptide. 21% of the 42 children with present or past overt malaria were antibody positive. Of the children with no such background, 8% were antibody positive. The corresponding seropositivity rates for asexual blood stages were 31% and 1% for the 2 groups respectively. It is concluded that (NANP)40 ELISA is potentially a valuable tool in sero-epidemiology, particularly in situations of seasonal transmission and recurrences due to drug resistance."
CD008122,0,11825772,0,Evaluation of anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies in Senegalese adults using different types of crude extracts from various strains of parasite.,"To date, no consensus exists on the type of crude Plasmodium falciparum Ags to be used in a standard assay for the evaluation of the overall anti-blood-stage immune response in humans. Comparison of the dose-dependent reactivity of using a pool of hyper-immune Senegalese sera to saponin and water schizont extracts of the Senegalese 07/03 isolate indicated similar reactivity on both types of antigen preparations. Water schizont extracts from three different strains of P. falciparum adapted to in vitro culture probed with a panel of specific mouse antisera and monoclonal antibodies reacting with conserved antigens showed similar antigenic content. Seroreactivity of immune individuals living in three different areas of endemicity was assessed in parallel on water crude extracts. The individual IgG, IgM and IgG subclass antibody responses to the various schizont preparations correlated positively. The specific IgM response was higher on the Senegalese schizont extract than on the FCR3 extract and was highest in Dielmo villagers. The IgG response was similar in all three locations and was strain independent. These results indicate that monitoring IgG antibody levels to the widely distributed FCR3 strain using an easily prepared crude lysate might represent a valuable reference ELISA allowing homogenisation and comparison of data from different laboratories."
CD008122,0,17401497,1,"Comparison of the diagnosis of malaria by microscopy, immunochromatography and PCR in endemic areas of Venezuela.","Whole blood samples (N = 295) were obtained from different locations in Amazonas and Sucre States, in Venezuela. Malaria was diagnosed by microscopy, OptiMAL and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae being detected when possible. We identified 93 infections, 66 of which were caused by P. vivax, 26 by P. falciparum, and 1 was a mixed infection. No infection caused by P. malariae was detected. The sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic method were high: 95.7 and 97.9% for microscopy, 87.0 and 97.9% for OptiMAL, and 98.0 and 100% for PCR, respectively. Most samples (72.2%) showed more than 5000 parasites/microL blood. The sensitivity of the diagnosis by microscopy and OptiMAL decreased with lower parasitemia. All samples showing disagreement among the methods were reevaluated, but the first result was used for the calculations. Parasites were detected in the 6 false-negative samples by microscopy after the second examination. The mixed infection was only detected by PCR, while the other methods diagnosed it as P. falciparum (microscopy) or P. vivax (OptiMAL) infection. Most of the false results obtained with the OptiMAL strip were related to the P. falciparum-specific band, including 3 species misdiagnoses, which could be related to the test itself or to genetic variation of the Venezuelan strains. The use of the microscopic method for malaria detection is recommended for its low cost but is very difficult to implement in large scale, population-based studies; thus, we report here more efficient methods suitable for this purpose."
CD008122,0,8784548,0,[Control of malaria re-emergence in Reunion].,"Réunion is currently posed with the operational problem of the last phase of the struggle against malaria, that is the consolidation and the maintenance of the state of cradication. The native parasite was eliminated, but the risk of resurgence of malaria remains on the island. This risk is even increasing from year to year because of the following: 1) the regular increase of the number of travellers originating from countries with malaria and consequently, the increase in the number of imported malaria cases; 2) the appearance of malaria strains resistant to amino-4-quinoleines, in the south-western regions of the Indian Ocean; 3) the persistence of the vector which cannot be eliminated because of its rapid evolutionary cycle and the multiplicity of its larval habitats. Furthermore, the reintroduction of malaria on the island would present serious consequences considering the disappearance of immunity in the population of Réunion. Thus it is necessary to maintain the struggle at a high level of intervention following a strategy based on: 1) the detection and the control of the malaria cases; 2) a targeted anti-vectorial activity based on a systematic anti-larval fight, eventually completed by the eradication of the adapted adult vectors. The reduction of personnel and the difficulties encountered in establishing a mechanization of the adapted tasks lead to a reduction of activities of insect eradication and endanger the existing strategy of the struggle. This strategy has been redefined during these last several years. The malaria situation in Réunion, satisfactory until today, rests on a careful epidemiological surveillance and on an optimized entomological surveillance. Currently, the treatments are abandoned in the least sensitive zones to the benefit of a better surveillance of priority zones (prospecting, entomological studies and treatments). Anopheles gambiae s.l. is present on the island and each year some parasites are imported to the Réunion territory. The requisite conditions for an eventual re-emergence of transmission of the native parasite would seem to be combined. However, this transmission is not observed. The role of the Applied Entomology Group is to evaluate the risk of malaria and to reorient, if necessary, the strategy of the antimalaria struggle in Réunion."
CD008122,0,19646407,0,Expression of tak1 and tram induces synergistic pro-inflammatory signalling and adjuvants DNA vaccines.,"Improving vaccine immunogenicity remains a major challenge in the fight against developing country diseases like malaria and AIDS. We describe a novel strategy to identify new DNA vaccine adjuvants. We have screened components of the Toll-like receptor signalling pathways for their ability to activate pro-inflammatory target genes in transient transfection assays and assessed in vivo adjuvant activity by expressing the activators from the DNA backbone of vaccines. We find that a robust increase in the immune response necessitates co-expression of two activators. Accordingly, the combination of tak1 and tram elicits synergistic reporter activation in transient transfection assays. In a mouse model this combination, but not the individual molecules, induced approximately twofold increases in CD8+ T-cell immune responses. These results indicate that optimal immunogenicity may require activation of distinct innate immune signalling pathways. Thus this strategy offers a novel route to the discovery of a new generation of adjuvants."
CD008122,0,9015508,0,Clinical overlap between malaria and severe pneumonia in Africa children in hospital.,"Data collected from 200 children admitted to a hospital on the Kenyan coast who met a broad definition of severe acute respiratory infection (ARI) indicated that simple clinical signs alone are unable absolutely to distinguish severe ARI and severe malaria. However, laboratory data showed that marked differences exist in the pathophysiology of unequivocal malaria and unequivocal ARI. Children in the former group had a higher mean oxygen saturation (97 vs. 94, P < 0.001), mean blood urea level (5.3 vs. 1.9 mmol/L, P < 0.001) and geometric mean lactate level (4.5 vs. 2.1 mmol/L, P < 0.001), and lower mean haemoglobin level (5.3 vs. 9.0 g/dL, P < 0.001) and base excess (-9.4 vs. -2.6, P < 0.001) than those in the latter group. Using these discriminatory variables it was estimated that up to 45% of children admitted with respiratory signs indicative of severe ARI probably had malaria as the primary diagnosis. Radiological examination supported this conclusion, indicating that pneumonia characterized by consolidation was uncommon in children with respiratory signs and a high malarial parasitaemia (> or = 10,000/microliters). There is no specific radiological sign of severe malaria. In practice, all children with respiratory signs warranting hospital admission in a malaria endemic area should be treated for both malaria and ARI unless blood film examination excludes malaria. In those with malaria and clinical evidence of acidosis, but no crackles, antibodies may be withheld while appropriate treatment for dehydration and anaemia is given. However, if clinical improvement is not rapid, antibiotics should be started."
CD008122,0,8265758,0,"The seroprevalence of cysticercosis, malaria, and Trypanosoma cruzi among North Carolina migrant farmworkers.","A seroprevalence study of cysticercosis, Trypanosoma cruzi, and plasmodia species and screening for active malaria was conducted among a randomly selected group of 138 Hispanic and Haitian migrant farmworkers. A random sample of labor camps in eastern North Carolina was selected. Blood samples were tested by Indirect Fluorescent Antibody techniques for plasmodial antibody and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for cysticerci and T. cruzi antibodies. Questionnaires collected demographic data and medical history of the workers and family. Blood films stained with Leukostat stain were examined for plasmodia species. The seroprevalence of cysticercosis was 10 percent, T. cruzi 2 percent, and plasmodia species 4.4 percent. One case of active malaria (Plasmodium vivax) was demonstrated. The clinical significance of seropositivity was not determined, but these results suggest that a small but significant number of farmworkers are infected with cysticercosis, T. cruzi, and malaria. Migrant health clinicians should be aware of the possible presence of these infections. Greater observance and enforcement of sanitation regulations in farmwork is needed to prevent transmission of cysticercosis."

Demographic description and pilot surveys.,"Madang district was selected for a longitudinal study of the effects of iron prophylaxis on infectious morbidity in infancy and the topography, climate, domicile, ethnology, demography, disease patterns, nutrition and health services of the district are described. The area has a tropical, humid climate and a mixed economy. Pneumonia was the main killing disease at all ages, and malaria was endemic. A base hospital and well organized maternal and child health services ensured that morbidity surveillance would be optimal. Pilot haematological surveys confirmed a high incidence of anaemia in infancy. Mean haemoglobin between nine and 52 weeks of age was 8.6 g/dl. Results suggested that malaria and iron deficiency were important causes of this anaemia."
CD008122,0,12625136,0,Anopheline vectors and malaria transmission in eastern Afghanistan.,"Anopheline vectors and malaria transmission were studied in 2 river-irrigated, rice-growing districts of eastern Afghanistan from May 1995 to December 1996. Clinical malaria was monitored in 12 rural villages (population 14,538) by passive case detection at local clinics. Adult mosquitoes were collected by space-spraying of living quarters and stables and by cattle bait catches. Mosquito head-thoraces (17,255 specimens) were tested for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax circumsporozoite protein (CSP) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The recorded incidence of P. vivax and P. falciparum was 199 and 41 episodes per 1000 person years, respectively. Twelve species of anopheline were recorded; Anopheles stephensi comprised 82% and A. culicifacies 5%. Eight species tested positive for CSP: A. stephensi, A. culicifacies, A. fluviatilus, A. annularis, A. pulcherrimus, A. maculatus, A. splendidus and A. superpictus. Among infected mosquitoes 46% were positive for P. falciparum, 45% for P. vivax VK-247, and 9% for P. vivax PV-210. Estimates of the feeding rates of infective vectors on humans indicated that A. stephensi would contribute 76% of infective bites, A. fluviatilis and A. pulcherrimus 7% each, and A. culicifacies and A. superpictus 3% each. The overall infective vector feeding rate correlated with the P. vivax incidence rate in the human population. The conventional view of A. culicifacies being the main rural vector and A. stephensi important only in urban settings needs to be reconsidered in western outreaches of the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent."

Comparative value in the rapid diagnosis of malaria].,"New emerging atypical forms of malaria, characterized by weak parasitemia, among peoples without premunition, back from Plasmodium falciparum resistant areas, make it necessary to use rapid, sensitive, reliable methods of parasitologic diagnosis. This work concerned two different populations: 394 expatriates back from a 4 months stage in endemic areas. 12 patients admitted for suspected of proved malaria. Authors have studied, by double blind method, versus thin film, two fluorescent techniques: a direct immunofluorescence, the Monofluo kit Falciparum of Diagnostic Pasteur. A nucleic acid fluorescence, on blood samples centrifuged in capillary tubes, the Q.B.C. test of Becton-Dickinson. Both methods seem of great interest for epidemiological surveys. The Q.B.C. test has showed more sensitivity than the thin film: it's rapidity of realisation indicates it for urgent diagnosis."

CD008122,0,11747054,0,Changing the first line drug for malaria treatment--cost-effectiveness analysis with highly uncertain inter-temporal trade-offs.,"Access to effective treatment would substantially reduce the burden of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, but resistance to chloroquine, the most commonly used first line drug, is now widespread. There has been considerable debate over the level of chloroquine resistance at which a new first line drug should be adopted. Two issues make this an extremely complex decision: it involves trade-offs in costs and health outcomes over time; and many of the parameters are uncertain. A modelling approach was identified as appropriate for addressing these issues. The costs and effects of changing from chloroquine to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as the first line drug were modelled over 10 years, allowing for growth in drug resistance. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to allow for the high levels of parameter uncertainty. The optimal year of switch was highly dependent on both empirical values, such as initial resistance and resistance growth rates, and on subjective values, such as the time preferences of policy-makers. It was not possible to provide policy-makers with a definitive threshold resistance level at which to switch, but the model can be used as an analytical tool to structure the problem, explore trade-offs, and identify areas for which data are lacking."

CD008122,0,8587791,0,Antibodies to Pf155/RESA and circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum in paired maternal-cord sera from Nigeria.,"Paired maternal-cord serum samples were analysed for antibodies to the Pf155/RESA and circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antigens of Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria parasites were found in 2.6% (3/117) of cord blood and 22.4% (26/116) of maternal samples. Immunofluorescence assays detected P. falciparum-specific IgG antibodies in all paired samples while P. falciparum-specific IgM was detected in 5.8% (7/121) of cord samples. The positivity rates for antibodies to Pf155/RESA and (NANP)6 but not (EENV)6, a C-terminal repeat sequence of Pf155/RESA, were significantly higher in maternal as compared with cord samples. Seropositivity rates to Pf155/RESA and (EENV)6 were not related to maternal parity group while positivity rates to the (NANP)6 peptide were higher in primiparae and multiparae of > or = 4 parity. These data confirm the transplacental transfer of P. falciparum-specific antibodies and the higher incidence of malaria parasitaemia in primiparae. The presence of P. falciparum-specific IgM in some cord samples suggests intrauterine sensitization of the foetus to malarial antigens."
CD008122,0,382470,0,A comparison of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect fluorescent antibody test in the sero-diagnosis of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Iran.,"ELISA AND IFAT have been applied to the sero-diagnosis of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis and the levels of leishmanial antibody detected by Leishmania donovani antigens in both tests have been compared. From the results it appears that ELISA is a little more sensitive than IFAT, but IFAT seems to be more specific in detecting leishmanial antibodies. In both tests reactions between leishmanial antigen and some other infections, such as malaria and typhoid, were observed. These non-specific reactions reduce the validity of both tests, especially ELISA, in the sero-diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis but, in visceral leishmaniasis, the leishmanial antibody levels were high enough to be unaffected by non-specific reactions. In general, ELISA is as good as IFAT and more practical in the sero-diagnosis and mass screening surveys for kala-azar."

No work to date has addressed the role of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) in influenza, the parallel being that in other severe proinflammatory cytokine syndromes (e.g., sepsis and malaria) levels of circulating HMGB1 are elevated and may correlate with death. Using a commercially available ELISA for HMGB1, we found that HMGB1 was not increased in the plasma of influenza virus-infected mice (A/Japan/305/57) on day 7 post infection, about the time of peak mortality, and peak levels of HMGB1 in the plasma did not occur until relatively late in infection, on day 9 post infection. In keeping with the late peak of HMGB1 being unassociated with mortality, administration of ethyl pyruvate, which inhibits active secretion but not passive release of HMGB1, to influenza virus-infected mice, did not affect their survival. Further work is required to determine whether influenza virus infection induces passive release of HMGB1, and whether HMGB1 neutralization with a specific Ab would improve survival."
CD008122,0,18446371,0,Modification of a human monoclonal antibody Fab fragment specific for Plasmodium falciparum 19-kDa C-terminal merozoite surface protein 1 by site-directed mutagenesis.,"We recently produced human monoclonal antibody Fab fragments specific for the 19-kDa C-terminal merozoite surface protein 1 of Plasmodium falciparum in a bacterial expression system. The effect of single amino acid modifications in the third complementarity-determining regions of the heavy and light chains on affinity was examined in one of the Fab fragments, Pf25. Recombination polymerase chain reaction was used to modify Tyr(92) or Ile(97) in the light chain and Val(101) or Trp(107) in the heavy chain. No effective replacements for Tyr(92) and Val(101) were found, but possible substitutions of Ile(97) with Gly, Leu, Glu, Ala and Ser, and of Trp(107) with Arg and Ser were demonstrated. Of these modified Fab fragments, the affinities of Fabs with Ile(97)-Leu and Trp(107)-Ser mutations were slightly higher than that of the original Fab. The effects of these modifications on the antigen-antibody interaction are discussed."

Significant differences were observed between falciparum malaria patients and the healthy people in term of levels of both sE-selectin and TM. The serum levels of sP-selectin and VWf were comparable between the two groups. The levels of both sE-Selectin and TM correlated positively with temperature, levels of IFN-gamma and levels of TNF-alpha; and negatively with hemoglobin levels. Trends of positive correlations were observed between level of sP-selectin or VWf and temperature. Furthermore, sE-selectin levels correlated with vomiting. These data suggest that sE-selectin and TM might be useful markers of endothelium activation in in vivo studies. Moreover, our results highlight the use of both sE-selctin and TM as markers of anemia."
CD008122,0,17984357,0,High prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection in Gabonese adults.,"Plasmodium falciparum, the most common malarial parasite in sub-Saharan Africa, accounts for a high number of deaths in children less than five years of age. In malaria-endemic countries with stable transmission, semi-immunity is usually acquired after childhood. For adults, severe malaria is rare. Infected adults have either uncomplicated malaria or asymptomatic parasitemia. During a period of one year, we screened 497 afebrile males to investigate the prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitemia in villages near Lambaréné, Gabon by use of three different methods. A total of 52% of the individuals had parasites detected by a subtelomeric variable open reading frame polymerase chain reaction (stevor-PCR), 27% of the rapid diagnostic test results were positive, and 12% of the thick blood smears with low parasitemias had P. falciparum. Most positive cases were only detected by the stevor-PCR. Asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitemia in adults living in a malaria-endemic country is frequent."

CD008122,0,10205793,0,Human antibodies to the 19kDa C-terminal fragment of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 inhibit parasite growth in vitro.,"The 19kDa, C-terminal fragment of the major surface protein of Plasmodium falciparum (PfMSP1(19)) is a candidate for inclusion in a subunit malaria vaccine. In this study, we show that PfMSP1(19)-specific antibodies, affinity purified from malaria-immune human serum, can: (i) compete with invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibodies for binding to PfMSP1(19) and (ii) mediate inhibition of parasite growth in vitro, in the absence of complement and mononuclear cells, at physiological antibody concentrations (100 micrograms/ml). Parasites expressing either the Kl or 3D7 allele of PfMSP1(19) were equally susceptible to inhibition of merozoite invasion, indicating that the target epitopes of inhibitory antibodies are conserved or cross-reactive. These studies suggest that vaccines designed to induce antibodies to PfMSP1(19) may protect against the high levels of malaria parasitaemia which are associated with clinical disease."

Officially there is a population of 150000 inhabitants, but in fact, there are probably about 200000 people, largely due to numerous illegal immigrants, especially coming from Anjouan the nearest Comorian island. There is only one hospital, with 252 beds. The malaria incidence reaches about 3000 cases per year; and treatments until august 2001 were generally haphazard. This is changing with the use of the Optimal rapid diagnostic test (DiaMed, Cressier Switzerland). More precise statistics should be available in the coming years. In 2000, 252 patients were hospitalised with malaria fever. Preventive measures were scarce. These have been reenforced this year, with the arrival of an entomologist, the use of reenforced pesticide pulverisation in high-risk areas, the distribution of impregnated bednets to pregnant women, and media based information campaigns. Common drugs resistance is becoming a real concern in Mayotte. First-line treatment was: chloroquine; second-line: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and third-line: quinine. In vitro studies have shown high levels of resistance, therefore another antimalarial drug therapy will be introduced at the end of the year: first-line: artemether-lumefantrine, second-line: mefloquine or halofantrine, third-line: quinine. To conclude, solutions exist but a real policy from the decision makers is necessary to implement them. The eradication of malaria remains a dream, but we can expect ""zero death"" in Mayotte, considering that the fight against this disease may help to start a regional health program."

In 2004, this has been altered to SP/artesunate in line with WHO recommendations of using Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs), despite the fact that all the neighbouring countries have abandoned SP-drug combinations due to high levels of SP drug resistance. In the study area, one year prior to the change to SP/AQ, SP alone was used to treat uncomplicated malaria cases.

There is as yet no clinically protective vaccine that has been developed against human malaria parasites. While several studies have demonstrated the inhibitory properties of human sera against Plasmodium falciparum, there is no reported investigation that has examined the protective effects of human breastmilk against the malaria parasite. This study demonstrates the presence of significant antibody titers to ring, trophozoite, schizont and gametocyte stages of P. falciparum in 144 Nigerian maternal milk samples and also in paired maternal and infant sera. The study also demonstrates significant in vitro growth inhibition of P. falciparum by maternal and infant sera, but most notably by breastmilk samples and breastmilk constituents, such as lactoferrin and sIgA. The results therefore suggest a protective in vivo role for breastmilk in the possible modulation of malaria frequency, severity and complications."

B- and T-cell epitopes of the malaria vaccine candidate gp190 were selected on the basis of a systematic search along the gp190 molecule and by computer prediction based on the amino acid sequence. Using some of the epitopes identified, we have redesigned the surface of the hepatitis B surface antigen lipoprotein particles by replacing the major antigenic determinants with malaria-specific sequences of up to 61 amino acids in length. Upon expression via vaccinia virus the hybrid particles elicit an anti-gp190 immune response in animals. Monoclonal antibodies derived from such infections recognize the native parasite."
CD008122,0,1455266,0,Comparison of the quantitative buffy coat technique with the conventional thick blood film technique for malaria case detection in the field.,"The quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique was compared with the conventional thick blood film technique in a malaria survey carried out in a mesoendemic area of malaria in Betau, Pahang, Malaysia. The QBC technique was found to be a rapid technique but had a sensitivity of about 56% and a specificity of 95%, using the thick blood film method as the ""gold standard"". Malaria species identification was unsatisfactory with the QBC technique as it could identify parasites correctly in only about 60% of specimens. It was unable to detect as positive about 58% of specimens which had parasite counts < or = 500 per ul but could detect about 94% of those with counts > 500 per ul. This difference in positive detection rate was significantly different (p < 0.05). It cannot quantify parasitemia easily and the specimens cannot be stored for future reference and for quality control purposes. It is therefore concluded that the QBC technique cannot replace the classical thick blood film technique for use in malaria control programmes. Its use may be appropriate in situations like busy blood banks and outpatient clinics where rapid screening of malaria infection is needed but where experienced malaria microscopists may not be available."
CD008122,0,2435181,0,Antibodies to the repetitive epitope of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein in a rural Tanzanian community: a longitudinal study of 132 children.,"An ELISA employing a novel synthetic peptide consisting of 40 (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro) repeats of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, (NANP)40, was used to detect antibodies against P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein in 132 children, 1 month to 15 years old, from a rural community (Kikwawila village) of Tanzania, a region where malaria is hyperendemic. The children were surveyed comprehensively over 3 consecutive years for clinical, parasitological, and serological parameters. Entomological data were also gathered for selected households in this village. The following results were obtained: anti-(NANP)40 antibodies increased as a function of age; the majority of children over 10 years showed a stable positivity for such antibodies during the longitudinal study; a negative correlation was observed between the levels of anti-sporozoite antibodies and both spleen enlargement and the presence of parasites in thick smears; no relationship was found between anti-(NANP)40 antibodies and asexual blood stage antibodies; children living in two representative households with comparable indoor resting mosquito densities showed markedly different frequencies of anti-(NANP)40 antibodies, in spite of comparable clinical, parasitological, and serological parameters. Thus, in addition to the exposure to infectious mosquito bites, other (e.g., genetic) factors, may play a role in the ability of certain individuals to mount an antibody response against this immunodominant repetitive epitope. The results presented in this paper confirm that the (NANP)40-ELISA represents a simple, reliable means for the detection of anti-(NANP)40 circumsporozoite protein antibodies and suggest that such antibodies may contribute to the immune protection against malaria in humans."

CD008122,0,17897768,0,"Differential effects on angiogenesis of two antimalarial compounds, dihydroartemisinin and artemisone: implications for embryotoxicity.","Artemisinin derivatives are highly effective and well-tolerated antimalarial drugs that now form the basis of antimalarial combination therapies recommended by the World Health Organization. Although not yet reported to be a problem in clinical use, neurotoxicity and embryotoxicity are displayed by the compound class in in vitro and in vivo experimental models, in particular by dihydroartemisinin, the main metabolite of all current clinical artemisinins. Embryotoxicity appears to be connected with defective angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in certain stages of embryo development. This may prevent the use of artemisinin derivatives in malaria during pregnancy, when both mother and fetus are at high risk of death. Artemisone is a novel 10-alkylamino derivative which is not metabolised to dihydroartemisinin. It was selected as a clinical drug candidate on the basis of its high efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro and its lack of detectable neurotoxicity in both in vitro and in vivo screens. Here we describe the results of a comparative study of the anti-angiogenic properties of both artemisone and dihydroartemisinin in different model systems. We evaluated the proliferation of human endothelial cells and their migration on a fibronectin matrix, the sprouting of new vessels from rat aorta sections grown in collagen and the production of pro-angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (CXCL-8). The data show that artemisone is significantly less anti-angiogenic than dihydroartemisinin in all the experimental models, suggesting that it will be safer to use than the current clinical artemisinins during pregnancy."

The sensitivity for detecting S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections with this single recombinant protein is 80.1%. The specificity is 94.8%. However, 15 of the 16 cross-reactive sera are malaria infection sera, and we have data suggesting that these malaria sera are actually recognizing an epitope on the vector-derived 6Xhistidine tag of recombinant Sm22.3. If this is the case, then, the actual specificity of the assay is 99.6%."

The diagnosis was made from Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear. The co-infection of falciparum malaria was excluded both by smear and ParaSight F-test. After a thorough clinical work up, biochemical investigations were done. The fever clearance and parasite clearance time were determined in all cases. Absence of malarial paroxysm (22.8 per cent), migrainous headache (4.5 per cent), myalgia (6.3 per cent), episodic urticarial rash (1.8 per cent), relative bradycardia (13.6 per cent) and postural hypotension (2.7 per cent) were the atypical manifestations encountered. Besides this, severe forms like jaundice (7.2 per cent), cerebral involvement (0.9 per cent), severe anaemia (7.2 per cent), thrombocytopenia (3.6 per cent) and pancytopenia (0.9 per cent) had been detected. All, except the patient with cerebral involvement were treated with chloroquine patients responded well to the treatment except two (1.8 per cent) patients who had chloroquine resistance. This study showed that vivax malaria can present with atypical and protean manifestations. The changing clinical profile along with development of chloroquine resistance may be considered as a warning signal."
CD008122,0,7810383,0,The influence of Maloprim chemoprophylaxis on cellular and humoral immune responses to Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stage antigens in schoolchildren living in a malaria endemic area of Mozambique.,"We examined the impact of chemoprophylaxis on the cellular and humoral immune responses to polypeptides of the asexual Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigens, the glutamate rich protein GLURP and Pf155/RESA, both of which in previous field studies have been identified as potentially protective antigens. The study was carried out in the Escola Primária de Lingamo, a primary school in a suburban area of Maputo, Mozambique. A cohort of 392 schoolchildren (aged 7-12 years) was randomly allocated to two equal groups, one receiving chemoprophylaxis with dapsone/pyrimethamine (Maloprim), the other receiving placebo every week from December 1989 to November 1990. The groups were then followed until November 1991 without chemoprophylaxis. Cellular responses to immunodominant epitopes from Pf155/RESA and GLURP, and to non malaria antigens C. albicans and PPD, were assessed by lymphocyte proliferation assays in vitro. Anti-GLURP and anti-Pf155/RESA antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and erythrocyte membrane immunofluorescence (EMIF), and total anti-P. falciparum antibodies were measured by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Immunological reactivities were evaluated every six months, at the end of the rainy season and at the end of the dry season, both during the period of chemoprophylaxis and during the follow-up. The antibody response rate to the GLURP was lower in the Maloprim group than in the placebo group during the intervention phase. The lymphoproliferative response rate to the malaria antigens was significantly lower at the end of the rainy season than at the end of the dry season, but the difference between the experimental group and the control group of schoolchildren was not statistically significant. These results suggest that the antibody responses to the GLURP molecule and partly to the Pf155/RESA antigen in this study population were shortlived and dependent on frequent boostering, but whether these antigens play a role in the development of natural clinical immunity remains open. In the experimental group of schoolchildren weekly chemoprophylaxis successfully reduced the parasite rate during the rainy season from 43% to 4%, and during the dry season from 18% to 0%. Chemoprophylaxis may therefore have a useful role in combination with another partially effective malaria control measure such as insecticide-impregnated bed nets or a malaria vaccine."
CD008122,0,12458125,0,Diagnosis of human fasciolosis in the Gilan province of Northern Iran: application of cathepsin L-ELISA.,"Fasciolosis, or liver fluke disease, caused by parasites of the genus Fasciola is emerging as an important disease in man, particularly in countries such as Bolivia, Peru and Egypt. Several outbreaks of this disease recently occurred in the Gilan province of Northern Iran and in 1999 alone over 10000 individuals were infected. Our laboratory recently developed an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) test for diagnosing human fasciolosis in an endemic area of northern Bolivia. The assay was based on the detection of serum antibodies reactive with antigens secreted by the parasite. In the present report we examined the sensitivity and specificity of this ELISA to diagnose 176 patients residing in the Gilan province of Northern Iran. These individuals presented at health clinics with clinical symptoms of fasciolosis and were subsequently positively diagnosed by fecal analysis. The ELISA employed total molecules secreted by the parasites (excretory/secretory, ES, products) and a protease, termed cathepsin L1 (CL1), which was purified from this preparation, as antigen. In addition, the specificity of the assay was investigated using serum from Iranian individuals that were infected with hydatidosis, toxocariasis, amoebiasis, malaria and kalaazar. Using this assay, both CL1 and ES exhibited a sensitivity of 100% (all 176 patients tested positive) and a specificity of 100% and 98.9%, respectively. In conclusion, our standardized diagnostic ELISA for human fasciolosis based on the detection of IgG responses to parasite ES and CL1 would be a valuable tool to diagnosis human fasciolosis in Iran and could be employed in a large survey to determine the prevalence of the disease throughout this region."
CD008122,0,8704940,0,Selective high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of artesunate and alpha- and beta-dihydroartemisinin in patients with falciparum malaria.,"A novel solid-phase extraction and a robust high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation procedure for artesunate and alpha- and beta-dihydroartemisinin, using post-column alkali decomposition and UV detection is described. Extraction was performed with Bond-Elut Phenyl solid-phase extraction cartridges and analysis by HPLC was carried out using a Waters Symmetry C8 5-microns 150 x 3.9 mm I.D. column. The mobile phase was 50% acetonitrile in 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.8) delivered at a flow-rate of 0.7 ml/min. The column eluate was mixed with 1.2 M potassium hydroxide in 90% methanol delivered at 0.3 ml/min, in a 1-ml reaction coil at 69 degrees C, to form UV-absorbing chromophores which were detected at 290 nm. The recovery of all analytes was greater than 80%. There was no significant difference in the peak-area ratio of alpha- and beta-dihydroartemisinin in plasma. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data from six adult Vietnamese patients who received 120 mg of artesunate by intravenous injection for the treatment of acute falciparum malaria are presented. Despite limited data, the mean half-life of artesunate was approximately 3.5 min while that for dihydroartemisinin was 34 min.

CD008122,0,12641610,0,Automated detection of malaria-associated intraleucocytic haemozoin by Cell-Dyn CD4000 depolarization analysis.,"Laboratory tests for malaria are only performed if there is clinical suspicion of the disease, and a missed diagnosis contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality. Malaria parasites produce haemozoin, which is able to depolarize light and this allows the automated detection of malaria during routine complete blood count analysis (CBC) with some Abbott Cell-Dyn instruments. In this study, we evaluated the Cell-Dyn CD4000 with 831 blood samples submitted for malaria investigations. Samples were categorized as malaria negative (n = 417), convalescent malaria (n = 64) or malaria positive (n = 350) by reference to thin/thick film microscopy, 'rapid test' procedures, polymerase chain reaction analysis and clinical history. With regard to CD4000 depolarization analysis, a malaria positive CD4000 pattern was ascribed to samples that showed one or more abnormal depolarizing purple events, which corresponded to monocytes containing ingested malaria pigment (haemozoin). Positive CD4000 patterns were observed in 11 of 417, 50 of 64 and 281 of 350 of malaria negative, convalescent malaria and malaria positive samples respectively. The specificity and positive predictive values for malaria (active and convalescent) were very high (97.4 and 96.8%, respectively), while sensitivity and negative predictive values were 80.0 and 83.0% respectively. Depolarization analysis was particularly effective for Plasmodium falciparum malaria but there was lower detection sensitivity for White compared with Black African patients. CD4000 90 degrees depolarization vs 0 degrees analysis revealed a proportion of samples with small nonleucocyte-associated depolarizing particles. Appearance of such events in the form of a discrete cluster was associated with P. vivax rather than P. falciparum infection."
CD008122,0,15217738,1,"[Malaria diagnosis and treatment in a rural Health Centre in Mayotte (Comoro archipelago, 2002)].","With a marked increase in both morbidity and mortality, as well as a high level of resistance to chloroquine (CQ), malaria is once again a major public health problem in Mayotte, a French overseas territory in the Comoro archipelago. The object of this study is to assess the contribution in the field of two new antimalarial fight steps taken in 2001-2002: The use of the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria OptiMAL in the rural health centres and the drop of the CQ alone for the simultaneous administration of CQ and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. All 581 suspected malaria attacks, diagnosed by RDT during the year 2002 in a rural health centre of the island, were registered. The good positive predictive value of the RDT used (97.2%) calculated during the study has permitted an important reduction of the rate of wrongly administer antimalarial treatment. Before RDT was used, through lack of emergency microscopic diagnosis, the antimalarial treatment was presumptive in the isolated health centres and that rate was superior to 90%. It is now below 3%. Before the introduction of the new protocol, in the middle of the year 2002, the rate of therapeutic failures with CQ used alone was 40.2% (33/82). With the simultaneous administration of CQ and SP as a first-line treatment, this rate fell down to 1.8% (6/337). For the time being, this new treatment policy is acceptable in Mayotte. But the experience of the countries who have adopted this therapeutic policy shows that the effectiveness of the association CQ-SP is likely to be temporary. It is necessary to set up a ""durable long-term"" therapy strategy in Mayotte as soon as possible by adopting as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria a combination therapy according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization. It could be the artemether-lumefantrine combination which has already been the subject of an efficacy survey in the island."

IgG antibody responses were predominantly directed to FC27 parasites and were correlated to the extension of polymorphism presented by each MSP-2 region. This finding demonstrated the impact of the genetic polymorphism on antibody response and therefore, its importance on malaria vaccine efficacy."

CD008122,0,12662417,1,"The hospital- and field-based performances of the OptiMAL test, for malaria diagnosis and treatment monitoring in central India.","The performance of the OptiMAL test, to detect and differentiate Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, was evaluated in central India. The subjects were either symptomatic patients, who presented at a referral hospital in urban Jabalpur, or the inhabitants of remote, tribal, forested villages where malaria is a major public-health problem. In each setting, the results of conventional microscopy were used as the 'gold standard'. Under hospital conditions, the test had excellent sensitivity (100%), good specificity (97%), a high positive predictive value (98%) and a high negative predictive value (100%). The corresponding values in the field-based study in the tribal villages (100%, 67%, 84% and 100%, respectively) were almost as good. The results of OptiMAL testing reveal the decline in parasitaemias (of P. falciparum or P. vivax) after drug administration. For monitoring the effectiveness of treatment, the test could therefore be a useful alternative to microscopy, particularly (1) in places where the facilities for microscopy are poor or non-existent and (2) among hospitalized patients with severe, complicated malaria (in whom parasitaemia and drug response need to be followed very carefully). Follow-up (within 28 days of diagnosis) of the 58 malaria cases detected in the field revealed that the OptiMAL test can be used to detect re-infection with a different Plasmodium sp. (sensitivity = 100%; specificity = 100%; J-index = 1) or recrudescence/re-infection with the same Plasmodium sp. (sensitivity = 83%; specificity = 100%; J-index = 0.83) accurately. The ability to use the test to distinguish P. falciparum from P. vivax, and to identify mixed infections of these two species, is of great significance in areas where the preferred and effective therapy for P. falciparum malaria differs from that for P. vivax."
CD008122,0,16691506,0,Role of C-reactive protein in complement-mediated hemolysis in Malaria.,"Human C-reactive protein (CRP) is a clinically important classical acute phase protein. Although CRP has been reported to bind with many nucleated cells, the direct binding of CRP to erythrocytes in diseases remains largely unexplored. The main focus of the present study was to investigate the binding of disease-specific CRP to erythrocytes of same patients. Distinct molecular variant of disease-specific CRP was affinity purified from sera of malaria patients (CRP(Mal)). This CRP showed strong binding with malaria erythrocytes (RBC(Mal)) as confirmed by flow cytometric analysis (FACS), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and radio binding assays. Calcium and phosphoryl choline (PC) were found to be essential for this interaction. A 2.3-fold increased binding of induced CRP to RBC(Mal) as compared to normal erythrocytes (RBC(N)) confirmed disease-specificity. Preincubation of RBC(Mal) with unconjugated CRP showed 3-5 fold inhibition. The association constant of CRP and RBC(Mal) was 4.7 x 10(6) cpm/microg with the corresponding number of receptors/cell being 4.3 x 10(5). The effector function of CRP(Mal) has been demonstrated by its potency to activate the complement pathway. An optimal dose of 10 microg/ml of CRP induced three-fold higher hemolysis of patient erythrocytes as compared to RBC(N). These studies provide direct evidence for an important phagocytic functional interaction of this acute-phase protein by triggering the CRP-complement pathway after the binding of CRP(Mal) with RBC(Mal). Hemolysis as triggered by this pathway may be one of the causative factors of anemia, a common clinical manifestation of this disease."
CD008122,0,10546844,1,Comparison of a rapid field immunochromatographic test to expert microscopy for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia in Thailand.,"We assessed a rapid, Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria Pf Test), for detection of asexual P. falciparum parasitemia in 551 subjects in three groups: (1) symptomatic patients self-referring for diagnosis, (2) villagers in a screening survey, and (3) patients recently treated for P. falciparum malaria. Expert light microscopy was the reference standard. ICT test performance was similar for diagnostic and screening modes. Four findings emerged: (1) test sensitivity correlated directly with parasite density, (2) test band intensity correlated directly with parasite density, (3) persistent test positivity after parasite clearance precludes its use for monitoring early therapeutic responses, and (4) a false negative test at 18,000 parasites/microl is unexplained. We conclude that a strong positive ICT test is highly predictive of falciparum asexual parasitemia for the diagnosis of new cases of falciparum malaria in Thailand, but a negative test result is inadequate to exclude parasitemia < 300/microl, and in some instances, even a higher parasitemia."
CD008122,0,10546840,0,Comparative efficacy of intramuscular artemether and intravenous quinine in Nigerian children with cerebral malaria.,"The efficacy of a 5-day treatment with intramuscular artemether (3.2-mg/kg loading dose followed by 1.6 mg/kg daily) was compared to that of the standard 7-day treatment with quinine (20-mg/kg loading dose followed by 10 mg/kg every 8 h) in a randomised clinical trial including 103 children aged 12-60 months with cerebral malaria between 1994 and 1996. No statistical difference of immediate efficacy was found between the two treatments. There were 11 (20%) deaths in the artemether group and 14 (28%) in the children who received quinine. The respective artemether versus quinine median fever clearance times (h) were 39 (interquartile ranges [IQ] 30-54) vs. 48 (IQ 30-60), and parasite clearance 42 (IQ 24-60) vs. 36 (IQ 30-48). However, one patient who received artemether had a recrudescence on day 14, which was successfully treated with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. Times to recovery from coma were 24 h (IQ 18-45) and 33 h (IQ 19-57), respectively. The occurrence of transient neurological sequelae including motor disabilities, cortical blindness, and afebrile seizures was also similar in the two groups. No adverse reactions to the two drugs were recorded during the study period. Artemether represents an important option in the management of cerebral malaria in Nigeria especially in rural areas where facilities for intravenous administration may not yet be optimal."

CD008122,0,8854004,0,Progress on vaccines against parasites.,"There has been significant progress in attempts to develop effective vaccines against parasitic diseases, including malaria, leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis. In malaria, in addition to field trials with SPf66, the Colombian malaria vaccine, several Plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccines are under Phase I testing, including NYVAC-7, a multi-antigen, attenuated recombinant vaccinia virus. Additional candidate antigens are at an advanced stage of pre-clinical development. In leishmaniasis, Phase III clinical trials on first generation vaccines (killed Leishmania, with or without BCG) are proceeding in several countries. Use of IL-12 as an adjuvant for use with killed Leishmania vaccine is being studied in non-human primates. A genetically constructed (gene knock-out) live avirulent Leishmania is being developed in preclinical studies as a potential live vaccine. Research is also underway to evaluate several recombinant proteins. The genes coding for such leading candidate antigens are also being incorporated into various live vectors to yield recombinant organisms with vaccination potential. In schistosomiasis, a strategy for the development of a vaccine against Schistosoma mansoni has been established, focussing on six priority recombinant antigens. An Asian S. japonicum vaccine development network has also been established, initially to develop a vaccine to block transmission in cattle and oxen, important reservoirs of the disease in Asia, and ultimately a human vaccine. As all of the above-mentioned vaccines will be used in the field in disease-endemic tropical countries, optimal stability will be of paramount importance."
CD008122,0,9373632,1,The ParaSight-F dipstick test as a routine diagnostic tool for malaria in Sri Lanka.,"Blood from 1053 persons who presented for treatment at outpatient clinics of government health institutions in Sri Lanka, and 250 who took part in a blood survey for malaria, was examined by thick blood film microscopy under routine field conditions, and by the ParaSight-F dipstick method. All the samples were also examined microscopically under laboratory conditions when 4 times the number of microscope fields were examined. Compared with this reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the ParaSight-F test were 90.2% and 99.1%, and those of microscopy in the field were 92.4% and 98.4% respectively, there being no statistically significant difference between the 2 methods. The ParaSight-F test reading correlated significantly and positively with the intensity of clinical disease of patients but not with their peripheral parasitaemia, indicating that it may be a more accurate measure of the true parasite load than microscopy, which detects only parasites which are in the peripheral blood and not those which are sequestered in deep organs. The ParaSight-F test, however, failed to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections with only gametocytes in the blood (19.6% of the infected blood samples in this study). The time taken for a patient to revert to negativity by the ParaSight-F test was also significantly longer, up to 14 d. This would make the test unsuitable for checking the response to antimalarial treatment within 14 d. In an endemic area it would therefore fail to detect drug resistant populations of parasites."
CD008122,0,9373633,1,The ParaSight-F rapid dipstick antigen capture assay for monitoring parasite clearance after drug treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Three methods for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection in peripheral blood were compared during antimalarial treatment and follow-up in 32 Burundian patients: dipstick antigen capture assay, standard (TBF) and prolonged thick blood film examination (PTBF) (3 x 5 min and 3 x 20 min examination respectively). Parasitaemia was determined daily by comparison with total white blood cell counts (determined by Coulter counter) until no parasite was detected on 2 consecutive days by PTBF. Cumulatively, 231 observations were made with each assay: 64 were negative and 167 positive by PTBF (59 had parasite counts < or = 100/microL). Compared to PTBF, the sensitivities of TBF and the dipstick assay were 1.0 for parasite counts > 100/microL and 0.458 and 0.966 respectively for counts < or = 100/microL. Overall, the dipstick assay was significantly more sensitive (0.988 vs. 0.808; P < 0.001) but less specific (P = 0.013) than TBF. The dipstick assay is of potential use for monitoring response to drug treatment and for detecting low parasitaemias."
CD008122,0,9373631,1,Malaria diagnosis by field workers using an immunochromatographic test.,"A rapid immunodiagnostic test (ICT Malaria PfTest) has been developed by ICT Diagnostics (Sydney, Australia) for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection. The test is an antigen capture assay based on the detection of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 in peripheral blood. This study was undertaken to assess the performance and usefulness of the test as a diagnostic method in highly malarious, inaccessible forested villages of Mandla district, central India. In all, 353 patients with fever were scanned by the test in parallel with thick blood film examination. The sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 84.5%, respectively. The whole test took about 5 min. The test results became negative in most cases (70%) within 7 d after initiation of curative chemotherapy. The test is simple, easy to learn and accurate, and may prove to be an important tool in the battle against falciparum malaria."
CD008122,0,9373634,0,Evaluation of a non-isotopic polymerase chain reaction-based assay to detect and predict treatment failure of Plasmodium vivax malaria in travellers.,"With the emergence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax (CRPV), new tests to detect P. vivax and predict response to therapy would be useful for clinical and research applications. We performed a 'blinded' evaluation of a non-isotopic (colourimetric) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay (Digene SHARP Signal System) compared with microscopy and PCR/radiometric probe hybridization of ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes (RPH) for the detection of P. vivax malaria in 182 febrile travellers. Compared with PCR/RPH as the reference standard, the colourimetric assay had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 98%. Using microscopy as the reference standard, 84 of 87 patients with P. vivax infection had a positive colourimetric assay. The 3 patients with a negative assay were subsequently shown to be infected with P. ovale as determined by PCR/RPH. In a subset of patients followed longitudinally, the colourimetric assay was positive in 5 of 13 patients 6 or more days after initiation of therapy. Of these 5 patients, 4 were subsequently demonstrated to be infected with CRPV as determined by treatment failure in vivo and/or chloroquine blood levels. A positive assay result 6 or more days after initiation of therapy was associated with subsequent treatment failure (P < 0.01). This non-isotopic assay is a sensitive, specific, and rapid method for the detection of P. vivax PCR products and may prove useful in predicting treatment failure."

CD008122,0,3328337,0,Detection of homologous and heterologous malaria antibodies by application of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigen to an ELISA.,"Sera of patients with anti-plasmodial antibodies determined by indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) were used to evaluate an enzyme immunoassay (IgG ELISA) for determining antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigen. The two tests correlated well. Antibodies to species other than P. falciparum, however, were detected by P. falciparum merozoite antigen to a limited extent only."
CD008122,0,2189244,0,"The relationship between splenomegaly and antibody to the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum in two groups of women with high and low enlarged spleen rates in Madang, Papua New Guinea.","The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies recognizing the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in 2 subpopulations of women with significantly different enlarged spleen rates but similar exposure to malaria, on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. Antibody levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to CS protein in the high and low spleen rate groups were similar (56.2% and 55.1%) but there was a significant difference in IgM (29.6% and 16.7%). In neither group did antibodies increase with parity (age). In both groups a high level of either IgG or IgM antibody to CS protein was associated with a high spleen rate and women with hyper-reactive malarious splenomegaly were more likely to be positive for both. Lower parasite rates were associated only with increased IgM antibody titres. High levels of antibody to blood-stage parasites were also present in the high spleen rate group, suggesting that antibodies to the CS protein were not protective. It is considered that cell-mediated immunity may be deficient in women with persistent splenomegaly."
CD008122,0,18971613,0,[Evaluation of usefulness of the panel test composed of malaria non-specific tests as a surrogate marker].,"Although malaria-specific antibody or antigen test is useful for the diagnosis of malaria infection, its cost-effectiveness has to be concerned in the area where malaria prevalence is very low. We created a panel test composed of malaria non-specific parameters, namely hematology autoanalyzer-derived results with or without addition of HDL-cholesterol data, and evaluated its usefulness in comparison with malaria-specific antibody test."
CD008122,0,1822456,0,Donor screening for malaria by antibody and antigen detection in endemic area.,"Transfusion-associated malaria is one of the dreaded threats to the safety of transfusion services in this malaria endemic world. The main drawback in preventing this menace is that routine blood donor screening techniques are not very satisfactory. In this study, blood donors were screened for antimalarial antibody by micro ELISA and Indirect Fluorescence Antibody (IFA) test and malarial antigen by monoclonal antibody (MAB) technique. A total of 19.37% and 12.39% blood donors showed significantly high antibody by ELISA and IFA test respectively, and 0.35% donors showed the presence of antigen by the MAB technique. Solitary dependence on malarial antibody detection as a screening test might have led to rejection of 19.02% blood donors without any apparent infection. So antigen detection in blood donors with the help of the MAB technique seems to be more sensitive and a practically feasible screening test to prevent transfusion malaria."
CD008122,0,14977966,0,Novel antigen identification method for discovery of protective malaria antigens by rapid testing of DNA vaccines encoding exons from the parasite genome.,"We describe a novel approach for identifying target antigens for preerythrocytic malaria vaccines. Our strategy is to rapidly test hundreds of DNA vaccines encoding exons from the Plasmodium yoelii yoelii genomic sequence. In this antigen identification method, we measure reduction in parasite burden in the liver after sporozoite challenge in mice. Orthologs of protective P. y. yoelii genes can then be identified in the genomic databases of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax and investigated as candidate antigens for a human vaccine. A pilot study to develop the antigen identification method approach used 192 P. y. yoelii exons from genes expressed during the sporozoite stage of the life cycle. A total of 182 (94%) exons were successfully cloned into a DNA immunization vector with the Gateway cloning technology. To assess immunization strategies, mice were vaccinated with 19 of the new DNA plasmids in addition to the well-characterized protective plasmid encoding P. y. yoelii circumsporozoite protein. Single plasmid immunization by gene gun identified a novel vaccine target antigen which decreased liver parasite burden by 95% and which has orthologs in P. vivax and P. knowlesi but not P. falciparum. Intramuscular injection of DNA plasmids produced a different pattern of protective responses from those seen with gene gun immunization. Intramuscular immunization with plasmid pools could reduce liver parasite burden in mice despite the fact that none of the plasmids was protective when given individually. We conclude that high-throughput cloning of exons into DNA vaccines and their screening is feasible and can rapidly identify new malaria vaccine candidate antigens."
CD008122,0,9546420,0,Plasma levels of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin in children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Gabon after administration of 50-milligram artesunate suppositories.,"A thermostable suppository of artesunate (artesunic acid) has been developed. In Gabon, 12 children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria received two administrations of this suppository in a 4-hr interval. Parasitemia and fever were then measured and the plasma levels of artesunate and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin, were determined by means of a reversed phase high-pressure liquid chromatography method using reductive electrochemical detection. Substantial parasite clearance (97-100%) was noted 24 hr after the beginning of the treatment and body temperature had returned to normal. Absorption, metabolism, and elimination of artesunate were rapid. Mean values of maximum plasma levels (Cmax) and maximum concentration peak times (tmax) were evaluated. The Cmax of dihydroartemisinin (0.18 +/- 0.10 microg/ml [mean +/- SE]) was higher than the Cmax of artesunate (0.09 +/- 0.04 microg/ml) and the tmax of dihydroartemisinin (1.13 +/- 0.58 hr) was higher than the tmax of artesunate (0.58 +/- 0.19 hr). Plasma levels 30 min after the second suppository administration were not consistently higher than those found 30 min after the first administration."
CD008122,0,11460936,0,Comparison of the OptiMAL rapid test with routine microscopic examination of Giemsa-Stained Thick Blood Film for diagnosis of malaria.,"The OptiMAL is a rapid immunodiagnostic test developed by Flow Inc., Portland, Oreg. for diagnosis and differentiation of P. falciparum and non P. falciparum malaria infection. It has been based on detection of circulating parasite lactate dehydrogenase enzyme (pLDH), produced by live Plasmodium parasites. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of the OptiMAL test with routine microscopic examination of Giemsa-Stained Thick Blood Film (routine GS-TBF) for the diagnosis of malaria at a local malaria clinic in a hyperendemic area of Thailand by using a standard GS-TBF (standard GS-TBF) as reference. One hundred and seventy five patients attending the clinic were recruited; 50, 42 and 83 were falciparum malaria, vivax malaria and non-malaria patients, respectively. Compared with the reference, the OptiMAL test had sensitivities of 92 per cent and 97.6 per cent, whereas, the routine GS-TBF had sensitivities of 81.3 per cent and 81 per cent for the detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. Both tests showed no false positive resulting in 100 per cent specificities. However, the OptiMAL test was able to detect only 20 per cent of infection with less than 200 parasitaemia/microlitre. It was also shown in our study that the OptiMAL test was advantageous in follow-up of the treatment outcome. No false positive occurred among 40 follow-up cases. The OptiMAL test detected malaria infection more accurately than the routine GS-TBF (p < 0.05) and was simple, easy to perform and rapid. It is an alternative tool for the diagnosis of malaria in a hyperendemic area where experienced microscopists are not available."
CD008122,0,16222030,0,High prevalence of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis D virus in the western Brazilian Amazon.,"Severe cases of hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis D virus (HDV) are often seen in the Brazilian Amazon, but there is a paucity of epidemiologic studies on viral hepatitis in this area. Thus, a cross-sectional study to investigate the prevalence of markers for HBV and HDV was performed. Serum samples were collected after participants completed an epidemiologic questionnaire. Markers for HBV and HDV were analyzed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The HBV genotype was determined by sequencing of the gene for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Of 2,656 samples, 89 (3.3%) were positive for HBsAg and 1,628 (61.5%) were positive for IgG antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. Markers for HDV were found in 47 cases (1.7%). Antibodies to HDV were associated with Amerindian ethnic origin, a lower educational level, a history of acute viral hepatitis, a history of malaria, male sex, a history of tattooing, and older age. The most frequent HBV genotypes were A and F. This study showed a high prevalence of HBV and HDV in the western Brazilian Amazon, as well as the predominance of HBV genotypes A and F."
CD008122,0,15965299,0,Seroprevalence to the circumsporozoite protein peptide antigen of Plasmodium vivax in Korean children.,"Recently, malaria re-emerged in the Republic of Korea (ROK), but there have been only a few reports on malaria seroprevalence. For the epidemiological study in children, a total of 1,176 serum samples were obtained from children and adolescent inhabitants from the three different regions, Pajoo, the Guro district in the western part of Seoul (Guro), and Ansan, from June to September 2002, when the transmission rate was high. Anti-circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antibody levels were assessed in samples using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Among the three regions, the highest IgG seroreactivity against the CSP antigen of Plasmodium vivax was found in the children from Pajoo (8.0%), followed by the children from Guro (3.2%), and those in Ansan (0.02%) had the lowest seroreactivity. In Pajoo, the profile of antibody response showed the highest in age 9, but decreased with age towards 12 years old. We found significant correlation between the seroprevalence and annual incidence in the investigated areas, suggesting that the area-related patterns reflected the differences of inoculation rates in children."
CD008122,0,1996743,0,The effect of chloroquine prophylaxis on yellow fever vaccine antibody response: comparison of plaque reduction neutralization test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"Weekly oral chloroquine prophylaxis for malaria has been associated with impaired antibody response to intradermal rabies vaccination. Experimental data indicate that chloroquine may inhibit yellow fever virus in vitro, yet there has been no clinical evidence to suggest that antibody response to yellow fever vaccine is impaired by concomitant oral administration of chloroquine. A prospective trial was undertaken to evaluate the antibody response to yellow fever 17D vaccine (Connaught Laboratories) of volunteers who were randomized to taking either chloroquine or no drug. Of fifty subjects, 28 were randomized to taking chloroquine, 22 were randomized to taking no drug. Yellow fever 17D vaccine was administered on day 0 and blood sampled on days 0, 14, 35 and 210. Chloroquine was administered weekly for four weeks. There was no significant difference in peak antibody titer by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) between the group that took chloroquine (mean log peak of reciprocal titer 1.43 +/- SD 0.60) with vaccine subcutaneously compared to vaccine-only group (mean log peak of reciprocal titer = 1.21 +/- 0.55). All fifty subjects seroconverted to yellow fever vaccine by day 210. ELISA testing was also performed on all subjects. The two tests showed good correlation (Spearman r = 0.675), although ELISA readings were positive by day 14 in significantly more subjects (p = .01). We conclude that routine anti-malarial doses of chloroquine do not affect antibody response to yellow fever 17D vaccine. ELISA testing, a less complex and less time-consuming test, correlates well with PRNT and is proposed for additional trials to measure yellow fever 17D vaccine response in flavivirus non-immune subjects."

One of four proteins was then identified on the basis of consistent IgG3, along with less variable IgG1 recognition. This protein has thus been selected for further functional assays of IgG1/IgG3 antibodies."
CD008122,0,1343689,0,Development of an immunoenzymatic assay using a monoclonal antibody against a 50-kDa catabolite from the P126 Plasmodium falciparum protein to the diagnosis of malaria infection.,"The WHO criterion of defering any donation of blood by a confirmed case of malaria for three years after cessation of therapy can not be applied in areas where malaria is endemic. For this reason we developed an immunoenzymatic assay for the detection of plasmodial antigens for blood screening in malarial endemic areas. So, we tested sera from 191 individuals. Among patients with active disease 100% of the cases of Plasmodium falciparum or mixed infections and 91.7% of those with P. vivax were positive for the presence of plasmodial antigens. The lower parasitaemia detected was 0.0003% for P. falciparum and 0.001% for P. vivax malária. When the frequency of positive circulating malarial antigens was evaluated among asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with negative TBS, positive results were found in respectively 38.7% and 17.7% of the individuals studied in the 30 days after confirmed malaria attack. Data provide by these assays have shown that ELISA seemed to be more sensitive than parasitological examination for malaria diagnosis. This test by virtue of its high sensitivity and the facilities in processing a large number of specimens, can prove to be useful in endemic areas for the recognition of asymptomatic malaria and screening of blood donors."
CD008122,0,3327567,0,Blood rheology in general medicine and surgery.,"Traditionally, blood rheology tests have been used in diagnosis and monitoring of infection, rheumatic diseases and malignancy, and are still of clinical value in these conditions. In the last twenty years, clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that the haematological determinants of blood flow resistance (haematocrit, fibrinogen, white cell count and altered red and white cell rigidity) are also associated with nutritional, metabolic, endocrine and vascular disorders. Decreased red cell deformability may contribute to reduced red cell survival and anaemia in burns, malaria, liver disease and kidney failure. In trauma and inflammatory disease, overt hyperviscosity is usually prevented by vasodilatation and reduction in the haematocrit. However, low-flow states may arise systemically from haemoconcentration (contracted plasma volume, Chapter 3) in severe burns, inappropriate red cell transfusion, or dehydration due to illness; systemically in circulatory shock; and locally in venous thrombosis or arterial disease. In such circumstances, the intrinsic flow resistance of blood may perpetuate flow disturbance, ischaemia and thrombosis. Conversely, optimal levels of haematocrit, fibrinogen and white cell count may be lower than normal in low-flow states. Haemodilution by colloid infusion is beneficial in burns, shock, major surgery, prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis, chronic stable claudication and possibly in acute stroke and retinal vein thrombosis. Plasma exchange may be beneficial in severe Raynaud's phenomenon. Defibrination with ancrod is effective in prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis but its role in arterial disease is unproven. The benefits of streptokinase therapy in venous thrombo-embolism and acute myocardial infarction may be partly rheological, due to fibrinogen depletion. Drugs with rheological effects may be beneficial in intermittent claudication."

CD008122,0,17176260,0,"Human pregnancy-associated malaria-specific B cells target polymorphic, conformational epitopes in VAR2CSA.","Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is caused by Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs) that bind to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) in the placenta by PAM-associated clonally variant surface antigens (VSA). Pregnancy-specific VSA (VSA(PAM)), which include the PfEMP1 variant VAR2CSA, are targets of IgG-mediated protective immunity to PAM. Here, we report an investigation of the specificity of naturally acquired immunity to PAM, using eight human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies that react exclusively with intact CSA-adhering IEs expressing VSA(PAM). Four reacted in Western blotting with high-molecular-weight (> 200 kDa) proteins, while seven reacted with either the DBL3-X or the DBL5-epsilon domains of VAR2CSA expressed either as Baculovirus constructs or on the surface of transfected Jurkat cells. We used a panel of recombinant antigens representing DBL3-X domains from P. falciparum field isolates to evaluate B-cell epitope diversity among parasite isolates, and identified the binding site of one monoclonal antibody using a chimeric DBL3-X construct. Our findings show that there is a high-frequency memory response to VSA(PAM), indicating that VAR2CSA is a primary target of naturally acquired PAM-specific protective immunity, and demonstrate the value of human monoclonal antibodies and conformationally intact recombinant antigens in VSA characterization."
CD008122,0,1951857,0,Halofantrine for the treatment of mefloquine chemoprophylaxis failures in Plasmodium falciparum infections.,"Thai soldiers who became slide-positive for malaria while receiving mefloquine chemoprophylaxis were treated with halofantrine to study its efficacy against mefloquine-resistant falciparum malaria. Thirty-two patients received three doses of 500 mg (1,500 mg total) of halofantrine at six-hr intervals, and were then observed for four weeks. Parasite recrudescence following treatment (median 21 days) occurred in seven of 23 patients (30%) who had mefloquine serum concentrations indicative of regular prophylaxis (greater than 500 ng/ml). Serum concentrations of mefloquine in all 32 patients averaged 950 ng/ml (range 26-2,515) prior to halofantrine treatment. The halofantrine serum concentrations were higher in patients cured by halofantrine than in patients with drug failure, but this was not statistically significant. Patients who were cured by halofantrine had parasites that were more sensitive in in vitro testing to mefloquine (mean [inhibitory concentration] IC50 = 12.5 ng/ml) than in patients whose parasitemias recrudesced (mean IC50 = 23.8 ng/ml) (P less than 0.01, by Wilcoxon rank sum test). These observations suggest that the current formulation and regimen of halofantrine are not optimal for the treatment of multiple drug-resistant falciparum malaria from Thailand."
CD008122,0,2694467,0,"Evaluation of malaria clinics in Maesot, Thailand: use of serology to assess coverage.","The clinics of the anti-malaria programme in Thailand serve an increasingly important role in the strategy for control of malaria within a context of multi-drug resistant falciparum malaria. Figures from clinics in Maesot District show a predominance of young males among positive cases treated (56% of all cases). In contrast, sero-epidemiological findings from a random sample of over 500 villagers in the area show similar exposure rates among males and females of equal age. There were no statistically significant differences between males and females 0-15 and 16-30 years old in percentages positive by indirect fluorescent antibody tests or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), mean level of ELISA positivity, or rate of sero-conversion. Differences in level of positivity did occur between males and females over 30. An index constructed from the serological findings indicated under-representation of children and women of all ages in clinics but suggested that coverage of children could be improved by the provision of a community-based, fixed-schedule mobile clinic."
CD008122,0,8495954,0,Placental malaria. I. Pathological classification.,"Pregnant women are more likely to contract malaria than their non-pregnant counterparts. The aim of this study was to develop a simple classification system for the histopathological diagnosis of placental malaria infection applicable to placentas collected in field conditions. The placentas were classified into four groups depending on the presence and distribution of parasites and malaria pigment: active infection, active-chronic infection, past-chronic infection, not infected. The frequency of parasitized placentas (26.4%) was in keeping with the prevalence of placental parasitaemia documented in epidemiological studies. An additional 29.8% placentas showed pigment in fibrin only, indicating past-chronic infection. Chronic placental malaria infection was most common in primigravidae, possibly reflecting ineffective clearance of parasites from the placenta. Seasonal fluctuations between infection categories support progression of placental infection with delayed clearance of pigment from fibrin. The proposed classification system has allowed diagnosis of different categories of placental malaria infection by two independent observers. A standardized method of diagnosis may enhance understanding of placental pathology and reduced birth weight in malaria infection during pregnancy."

CD008122,0,19014683,0,Effect of treating Schistosoma haematobium infection on Plasmodium falciparum-specific antibody responses.,"The overlapping geographical and socio-economic distribution of malaria and helminth infection has led to several studies investigating the immunological and pathological interactions of these parasites. This study focuses on the effect of treating schistosome infections on natural human immune responses directed against plasmodia merozoite surface proteins MSP-1 (DPKMWR, MSP1(19)), and MSP-2 (CH150 and Dd2) which are potential vaccine candidates as well as crude malaria (schizont) and schistosome (whole worm homogenate) proteins."
CD008122,0,19546191,0,Functional and immunological characterization of a Duffy binding-like alpha domain from Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 that mediates rosetting.,"The Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains are common adhesion modules present in Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) variants, which are responsible for immune evasion and cytoadherence. Knowledge about how immune responses are acquired against polymorphic DBL domains of PfEMP1 can aid in the development of vaccines for malaria. A recombinant DBLalpha domain, encoded by R29 var1, which binds complement receptor 1 to mediate rosetting by the P. falciparum laboratory strain R29, was expressed in Escherichia coli, renatured by oxidative refolding to its native form, and purified to homogeneity. Antibody levels in 704 plasmas obtained from residents of areas of different levels of malaria endemicity in Orissa (India) and Manhiça (Mozambique) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The refolded DBLalpha domain was pure, homogeneous, and functional in that it bound human erythrocytes with specificity and was capable of inhibiting rosetting. The proportion of individuals who had measurable anti-DBLalpha immunoglobulin G responses was low in areas of low malaria endemicity in Orissa (6.7%) but high in areas of high endemicity in Orissa (87.5%) and Manhiça (74.5%). Seroprevalence and antibody levels against the recombinant protein increased with the age of inhabitants from areas with high transmission rates (P < 0.001). Half of the children in these areas had seroconverted by the age of 5 years. These findings suggest that in spite of the extreme polymorphism of PfEMP1 DBLalpha domains, the acquisition of specific antibodies is rapid and age related and reflects the reduced risk of malaria in areas with high transmission rates. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of these antibodies in protection from malaria."
CD008122,0,18330075,0,Prevalence of imported malaria in Parma during 2005-2006.,"Malaria is a protozoan infection caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium (P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae) that is transmitted from one human to another by female Anopheles mosquitoes. It can be considered a reemerging imported disease in our area because of increasing of movements from endemic countries, and nowadays it is the most common imported infection in Italy. This study describes the occurrence of imported malaria in our area between January 2005 and May 2006."
CD008122,0,16988458,0,Immunological responses of neonates and infants to DNA vaccines.,"In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, it is believed that most of the deaths attributed to malaria occur in infants. For this and other logistical reasons, if a malaria vaccine is developed and licensed, it will have to be administered to neonates or young infants, when they have maternally acquired antibodies against malaria parasite proteins. Pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines in development rely on CD8(+) T cells as immune effectors, yet some studies indicate that neonates do not mount optimal CD8+ T-cell responses. We report that BALB/c mice first immunized as neonates (7 d) with a Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein (PyCSP) DNA vaccine mixed with a plasmid expressing murine granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (DG) and boosted at 28 d with pox virus expressing PyCSP were protected (93%) as well as mice immunized entirely as adults (70%). Like adults, protection was dependent on CD8(+) T cells and accompanied by excellent anti-PyCSP interferon-gamma and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses. Mice born of immune mothers (previously exposed to P. yoelii parasites or immunized with the same vaccine given to the neonates) were also protected and had excellent T-cell responses. These data support assessment of this immunization strategy in neonates/young infants in areas where malaria exacts the greatest toll."
CD008122,0,12632149,0,Design and development of an immunosensor for the detection of malaria in field conditions.,"Eradication of malaria in Southeast Asian countries is still a distant goal, due to the absence of a simple, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic technique. Here, an immunosensor for the photometric detection of malaria, the malaria-detecting immunosensor (MDI), is developed to detect Plasmodium falciparum malarial antibodies in human blood. The method uses the principle of laser light-scattering by latex bead agglutinates in media monitored by a light-detecting device. Agglutination is induced by mixing antigen-coated latex beads with serum antibodies. Immunoreactions are measured in terms of the Tyndall effect in the transmitted beam detected by photodiodes. MDI sensitivity and specificity are compared with the results of enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay and laser light-scattering immunoassay techniques, which show that it is a good and sensitive monitoring device."
CD008122,0,9488393,0,Antigenicity of recombinant proteins derived from rhoptry-associated protein 1 of Plasmodium falciparum.,"Rhoptry-associated protein 1 (RAP1) of Plasmodium falciparum is a potential component of a malaria vaccine. We have expressed in Escherichia coli eight recombinant RAP1 proteins representing almost the entire sequence of the mature protein and assessed the antigenicity of the proteins by immunization of mice. Antisera to six of the recombinant proteins reacted specifically with parasite-derived RAP1 (PfRAP1), as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and by immunoblotting. These proteins were then used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to evaluate human antibody responses to RAP1 during naturally transmitted infections in The Gambia. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies specifically reactive with the recombinant RAP1 proteins are directed mostly towards fragments containing the N-terminal sequences of mature PfRAP1. The most N-terminal segment (residues 23 to 175) contains only minor epitopes, while major epitopes are outside this region. Antibodies from malaria patients do not compete for a linear epitope recognized by an inhibitory anti-RAP1 monoclonal antibody. Analysis of IgG subclass distribution shows that human anti-RAP1 antibodies are predominantly IgG1."
CD008122,0,12632146,1,"Comparison of three antigen detection tests for diagnosis and follow-up of falciparum malaria in travellers returning to Berlin, Germany.","We determined the sensitivity and specificity of three rapid immunochromatographic malarial antigen detection test systems (RDTs) for the detection of Plasmodium falciparumand assessed the quality of follow-up results. ParaSight-F and ICT Malaria detect histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2), whereas OptiMal detects plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). ParaSight-F performed with 95.1% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity (554 patients tested of whom 144 had falciparum malaria). ICT Malaria performed with 95.7% sensitivity and 99.2% specificity (718 patients tested of whom 184 had falciparum malaria). OptiMal performed with 76.2% sensitivity and 99.7% specificity (539 patients tested of whom 130 had falciparum malaria). In follow-up investigations, HRP-2 did not appear to be a useful antigen due to its long half-life, whereas pLDH offers a reasonable correlation with the presence of viable parasites in those cases initially detected. We therefore conclude that a combination of both antigens might be the best option for creating a reliable RDT for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria."
CD008122,0,8509653,0,Fast immunopurification of small amounts of specific antibodies on peptides bound to ELISA plates.,"ELISA is widely used as a means to detect antibodies, but the potential of ELISA plates as an immunosorbent for the purification of specific antibodies does not seem to have been evaluated. In this study, ELISA plates coated with peptides representing short sequences of various antigens from Plasmodium falciparum, the etiologic agent of human malaria, have been successfully used as a means to purify small amounts of the corresponding antibodies. ELISA plates, identical to those used for antibody detection, also permitted the evaluation of various elution conditions for each pairing of peptide and serum; we tested four eluting buffers (0.2 M glycine, pH 2.5; 0.2 M lysine, pH 11.5; 3.0 M MgCl2, 0.075 M Hepes, 25% ethylene glycol, pH 7.1-7.2 and 4 M NH4SCN in 0.1 M NaH2PO4, pH 6.0) with four pairs of peptides and sera. The ELISA plates could also be used to estimate the affinity of the eluted antibodies by the technique of Pullen et al. (1986). The eluted antibodies were compared to those obtained by immunopurification on recombinant proteins adsorbed on nitrocellulose filters. In contrast to the latter, they were not contaminated by antibodies directed against the carrier moiety of the recombinant protein. When used in immunofluorescence assays with various stages of the parasite the antibodies immunopurified on peptides bound to ELISA plates were able to react with the native antigens in the parasite."
CD008122,0,8536555,0,Artesunate. A review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of malaria.,"Artesunate is an antimalarial agent, available in oral, rectal and parenteral formulations, that provides a rapid clinical effect in patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The rapidity of effect, availability of an intravenous and intramuscular formulation and convenient dosage regimen make artesunate an ideal candidate for the treatment of severe malaria, including cerebral disease. While some results have been promising, there is no clear evidence to date that artesunate reduces mortality in patients with cerebral malaria to any greater extent than standard quinine therapy. When given as monotherapy, treatment should be continued for at least 5 to 7 days to prevent recrudescence. Combination therapy with mefloquine allows artesunate to be administered over 3 days or less, with a satisfactory clinical outcome maintained. Although optimal dosages remain to be determined, this combination continues to provide the rapid onset of clinical effect observed with artesunate monotherapy, but decreases the rate of recrudescence to 2% (i.e. radical cure rate of 98%) when used as treatment in patients with uncomplicated malaria from areas with a high risk of multidrug-resistance falciparum malaria. Although assessment of tolerability is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between disease- and treatment-related events, artesunate and artesunate-mefloquine combinations appear to be well tolerated in adults and children. Indeed, it is possible that prior administration of artesunate may reduce the incidence of mefloquine-induced vomiting. Clinical findings to date have not revealed any pattern of resistance to artesunate after use of the drug. However, given the history of the development of resistance to other antimalarial drugs, the use of artesunate should be restricted to areas of multidrug resistance, the drug should be used in combination with a longer acting agent such as mefloquine, and it should be used in regimens that provide radical cure rates of 90 to 100%. If used according to these treatment principles, artesunate will provide a well tolerated and valuable addition to the current extremely limited treatment options for multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria, a widespread parasitic disease associated with considerable mortality."
CD008122,0,11388507,1,Diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic countries by the ParaSight-F test.,"QBC, examination of thin blood smears, and Parasight-F were performed for every case of malaria suspected between May 1997 and December 1998. Data from 310 patients were reported. Fifty had malaria infection diagnosed by QBC and thin blood film, among whom 39 had Plasmodium falciparum infection. Three of these 39 were negative with the Parasight-F test. Eleven patients had a positive ParaSight-F test but microscopic diagnosis methods were negative. Interpretation of these 11 positive ParaSight-F results is proposed to depend on clinical criteria."
CD008122,0,15228812,1,Relative utility of dipsticks for diagnosis of malaria in mesoendemic area for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax in northeastern India.,"For diagnosis of malaria, popular brands of rapid test kits collectively termed as ""dipsticks"" were subject to field evaluation in northeastern India for their comparative sensitivity and specificity vis-à-vis conventional microscopic results. Dipsticks based on Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein (Pf HRP-2) antigen capture assay revealed 100% sensitivity and high specificity (94-100%); thus, they were concluded to be reliable tools for confirmed diagnosis of malarial infection. However, an advanced version of the same kit, having incorporated additional pan-malarial monoclonal antibody, was found to be less sensitive (71%) for non-falciparum infections. Besides, Pf HRP-2-based kits continued to show positive results up to day 7, even after clearance of parasitemia on account of persistent antigenemia. This very limitation seemed to have been overcome by parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) enzyme-based kit. This kit was observed to have high sensitivity (81-89%) and specificity (100%) for both falciparum and non-falciparum malaria, but cannot distinguish mono-infection from mixed infections. It is concluded that the rational use of these kits would accord health benefits in terms of early detection and prompt treatment, reduce drug pressure, and possibly delay the emergence and spread of multi-drug-resistant strains of malarial parasites."
CD008122,0,11425165,0,Short report: increased susceptibility to Plasmodium malariae in pregnant alpha(+)-thalassemic women.,"The influence of alpha(+)-thalassemia on malaria in pregnancy was assessed in a cross-sectional study of 530 women in Ghana. Plasmodial infections, alpha(+)-thalassemia, serum levels of C-reactive protein, and antimalarial drugs in urine were determined. The alpha-globin genotypes did not correlate with the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum-infection and parasite densities. However, Plasmodium malariae tended to be more frequent in alpha(+)-thalassemic women (P = 0.05). Excluding women with residual antimalarials, a significant excess of P. malariae was observed in alpha(+)-thalassemic individuals. Febrile responses (P = 0.05) and inflammation (CRP > 0.6 mg/dl, P = 0.06) appeared to be less common in infected alpha(+)-thalassemic women and were also comparatively rare in parasitemic individuals who harbored double species infections with P. falciparum and P. malariae. Plasmodium malariae may influence the pathogenesis of falciparum malaria leading to a low prevalence of inflammation and febrile responses in alpha(+)-thalassemic women."
CD008122,0,2882132,0,Use of enzyme-linked synthetic DNA in diagnosis of falciparum malaria.,"Plasmodium falciparum contains a family of 21-base-long repetitive DNA sequences in its genome. A 21-base synthetic DNA oligomer, formerly labelled with phosphorus-32 for autoradiographic detection of P falciparum DNA, was covalently coupled to alkaline phosphatase for histochemical detection. The conjugate (PFR1-AP) detected purified P falciparum DNA with a sensitivity and specificity equal to that of 32P-labelled probes after 2-day exposures. PFR1-AP did not detect host DNA or DNA of other Plasmodium species. In African blood specimens PFR1-AP specifically detected P falciparum infections of 100 parasites/microliter. This sensitive, rapid, nonisotopic probe will allow more widespread use of DNA hybridisation in the diagnosis of malaria."
CD008122,0,1941350,0,Evaluation of direct agglutination test (DAT) and ELISA for serodiagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in India.,"The direct agglutination test (DAT) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used for serodiagnosis of parasitologically confirmed Indian visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases. All the sera of VL cases were positive by both the methods. DAT titres of VL cases were greater than or equal to 1:3,200, and ELISA values were greater than or equal to 0.55 1:400 dilution. In the control group, sera of widely prevalent diseases of India, such as leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria, and liver cirrhosis, were included. Both tests could discriminate between VL and other patients of the control group. The sera of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients gave OD values of greater than 0:55 and had DAT titres of 1:1,600. Both tests are sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of VL cases. DAT, being simpler and more economical, will be suitable for diagnosis and epidemiological studies for VL under rural conditions of India."

CD008122,0,7028768,0,Sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis for chloroquine in body fluids. Application to studies of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum.,"A high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the sensitive determination of chloroquine in body fluids. THe method has been applied to quality-control assay of World Health Organization (WHO) In-Vitro, Macro-Test Kits for the assessment of susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine. Experiments utilizing [14C] chloroquine demonstrated that water was not capable of efficiently desorbing chloroquine from the inside surfaces of kit vials. The addition of blood to the vials effectively desorbs chloroquine. Subsequent addition of the blood to aqueous base followed by hexane extraction permits quantitation by reversed-phase, ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography utilizing ultraviolet detection at 344 nm. The method is capable of determining as little as 20 ng of chloroquine per vial. This method, utilizing the methyl ether of 9-anthra cenemethanol as internal standard, can quantify chloroquine in 1 ml of blood or urine with a minimum detection limit of 20 ppb (ng/ml). Measurement of blood levels of chloroquine in persons contracting falciparum malaria while following a prophylactic regimen complements in-vitro drug susceptibility measurements in characterizing resistant strains of the parasite."
CD008122,0,14672301,0,Experiences of a community-based dietary intervention to enhance micronutrient adequacy of diets low in animal source foods and high in phytate: a case study in rural Malawian children.,"A community-based dietary diversification/modification intervention, employing a quasiexperimental design with a nonequivalent control group, was conducted in two intervention and two control villages in rural Southern Malawi. The aim was to enhance the content and bioavailability of micronutrients in maize-based diets of stunted children ages 30-90 mo. Efficacy was evaluated through a comparison of the changes in knowledge and practices, anthropometry, malaria screening, hemoglobin and hair zinc after 12 mo, common infections monthly postintervention and nutrient adequacy postintervention via 24-h recalls. Intervention diets were more diverse and of higher quality than the control diets, supplying significantly more animal source foods, especially soft-boned fish, but less phytic acid (p < 0.01). Median intakes of energy, protein, calcium, available zinc, heme iron and vitamin B-12 were greater (p < 0.05) in intervention compared to the control groups; some spread of knowledge and practices to the control groups occurred. Intervention enhanced Z-scores for mid-upper-arm circumference and arm muscle area (p < 0.001), but had no impact on weight or height gain. After controlling for baseline variables, mean hemoglobin was higher (107 vs. 102 g/L; p < 0.01) postintervention, whereas incidence of anemia and common infections were lower in the intervention groups compared to the control groups, with no change in malaria or hair zinc status. Dietary strategies reduced the prevalence of inadequate intakes of protein, calcium, zinc and vitamin B-12, but not iron, because fish was the major source of animal food consumed. More efforts to raise small animals and promote their consumption are needed to enhance dietary quality and ensure optimal growth, health and cognitive development in young Malawian children."
CD008122,0,8916803,0,Efficacy and tolerance of artemisinin in short combination regimens for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.,"Two oral regimens comprising a single dose of 20 mg/kg of artemisinin followed by three days of quinine, 10 mg/kg three times a day (AQ), or doxycycline, 4 mg/kg once a day (AD), were compared with a standard seven-day course of oral quinine, 10 mg/kg three times a day (Q), in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Of 161 treated patients, 157 could be included in the analysis. The mean +/- SD parasite clearance time was 43 +/- 14 hr for AQ and 41 +/- 19 hr for AD, and significantly longer for quinine: 66 +/- 24 hr (P = 0.0001). Treatment failure occurred in one Q and in 3 AD patients. The recrudescence rate was 16% for Q, 28% for AQ, and significantly worse for AD: 67% (P = 0.0001). Adverse effects were mainly limited to cinchonism. The conclusion is that a seven-day course of quinine is still effective in the initial treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Vietnam, but one should pay attention to possible recrudescence. The addition of a single 20 mg/kg per os dose of artemisinin allows for shortening the duration of treatment, with faster parasite clearance, comparable efficacy, and better tolerance, but with no reduction of recrudescence. The combination of artemisinin with three days of doxycycline is also not effective in preventing recrudescence."

An immunoreactive band was observed at 43 kDa in CSF samples of cerebral malaria patients but not in non-malaria cases when tested with rabbit anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies by Western blot analysis. Eleven reactive monoclonal antibodies against P. falciparum were stabilized and expanded. Nine monoclonal antibodies were reactive to CSF samples of cerebral malaria and non-malaria and P. falciparum antigen by dot-ELISA and a common immunoreactive band at 43 kDa by Western blot. One clone Cl-2 was reactive at 43 kDa with CSF of the cerebral malaria patients and also in P. falciparum antigen but at 66 kDa with non-malarial CSF samples in Western blot. The other two clones (Cl-6 and 14) reacted with 3/31 (90% specific) and 8/31 (74%) CSF samples of non-malaria patients, respectively. The monoclonal antibody based ELISA reported in the present study using clone-6 can therefore offer another possibility for developing rapid, easy-to-perform, low-cost tests for diagnosis of cerebral malaria in CSF samples. Western blot using clone-2 might be useful for the detection of cerebral malaria antigen in CSF."

The probe technique successfully diagnosed malaria in experimentally infected chimpanzees that had 0.001% parasitemias (50 parasites/microliter) as determined by blood smears, and in 1 chimpanzee whose blood smear was negative, but whose blood was culture-positive for P. falciparum. In a double blind study of 50 patient samples from the Philippines, the probe results correlated well with blood smear results when the autoradiographs were read after 4-8 hr exposure. The results indicate that the oligonucleotide probe may be useful in the rapid and specific diagnosis of P. falciparum infection."

The examination of random human blood smears, prepared at the time of mosquito capture, indicated overall human infection rates of 16.7% and 10.9% for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. Two immunoassays, the immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), based on the use of species-specific antisporozoite monoclonal antibodies, were used to analyze a total of 9,040 field-collected Anopheles mosquitoes for plasmodial infection. P. falciparum sporozoite antigen was detected in A. darlingi at rates varying from 2.7% to 4.2%, and in small numbers of A. oswaldoi collected in 1 of the districts. In contrast, sporozoite antigen of P. vivax was found in A. darlingi, A. triannulatus, A. nuneztovari, and A. albitarsis at rates ranging from 0.9% to 12.0%. By dissection, sporozoites were found in the salivary glands of these same 4 species at rates ranging from 0.8% to 2.2%. The latter 3 species had not previously been implicated as malaria vectors of any significance in northern Brazil."

In view of this, the Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein (HRP-II) antigen detection assay (ParaSight-F test) was tried at 10 health centres in 3 malaria endemicity zones of Zimbabwe, as a malaria diagnostic tool for primary health care. Parasitological evaluations were conducted using thick and thin film microscopy as gold standard, and ease of test operation and practicability to nurses were ascertained by questionnaire. The sensitivity of the test did not vary substantially by endemicity zone and was approximately 93%. Specificities were 85, 72 and 92% in the hyperendemic, mesoendemic and hypoendemic zones, respectively. Positive predictive values varied considerably with endemicity, the lowest being in the hypoendemic zone (56%). However, negative predictive values did not change significantly, with a mean of 94%. It was found that the ParaSight-F test reduced mistreatment for malaria, relative to clinical diagnosis, by up to 81%, especially in the hypoendemic region. Test acceptability evaluations were good."
CD008122,0,1877717,0,"Anopheline ecology and malaria infection during the irrigation development of an area of the Mahaweli Project, Sri Lanka.","A study on adult anopheline ecology and malaria vector incrimination was carried out from 1986 to 1989 during irrigation development in an area of the Mahaweli Project in eastern Sri Lanka. Eleven potential vector species were collected resting indoors or by using human or bovid bait, and from light trap catches. Overall, Anopheles vagus (Donitz), An. annularis (van der Wulp), and An. subpictus (Grassi) were the most prevalent, and An. culicifacies (Giles) and An. barbirostris (van der Wulp) were the least prevalent species. The abundance of An. aconitus (Donitz), An. jamesii (Theobald), An. pallidus (Theobald), and An. subpictus increased after irrigation development, while An. annularis, An. barbirostris, An. culicifacies and An. varuna (Iyengar) decreased. Populations of An. nigerrimus (Giles), An. tessellatus (Theobald), and An. vagus did not change substantially. Seven species were infected with malaria parasites, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) done on mosquito head-thorax triturates. The main species involved were An. annularis, at peak abundance during the 1986-1987 period of development leading to the onset of irrigation, and An. subpictus, during times of seasonal abundance in the post-irrigation period of 1988 to 1989. Although occurring at low abundance, An. culicifacies was involved in malaria transmission irregularly throughout the study period. While there was strong ELISA-based evidence implicating An. subpictus as a major post-irrigation vector, confirmation of its vector status must await dissection and ELISA-based evidence of P. vivax and P. falciparum sporozoite infection rates in salivary glands."

Different brands of mefloquine (MQ) have been reported to be non-bioequivalent; this could result in sub-therapeutic levels of mefloquine with decreased efficacy. In 2002, mefloquine-artesunate (MQ-AS) combination therapy was adopted as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Amazon region of Peru. Although MQ resistance has yet to be reported from the Peruvian Amazon, it has been reported from other countries in the Amazon Region. Therefore, continuous monitoring is warranted to ensure that the first-line therapy remains efficacious. This study examines the in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters through Day 56 of three commercial formulations of MQ (Lariam, Mephaquin, and Mefloquina-AC Farma) given in combination with artesunate."
CD008122,0,19089927,0,Children with endemic Burkitt lymphoma are deficient in EBNA1-specific IFN-gamma T cell responses.,"Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is the most common childhood cancer in equatorial Africa and is linked to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Plasmodium falciparum coinfections early in life. Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is the sole viral latent antigen expressed in BL tumors. Loss of EBNA1-specific immune surveillance could allow eBL emergence. Therefore, EBNA1-specific T cell responses were analyzed by IFN-gamma ELISPOT in Kenyan children with eBL and compared to healthy children with divergent malaria exposure. Significantly fewer children with eBL, 16% (7/44) had EBNA1-specific IFN-gamma responses in contrast to healthy children living in a malaria holoendemic area or in an area with sporadic malaria transmission, 67% (40/60) and 72% (43/60) responders, respectively (p < 0.003). Children with eBL maintained IgG(1) dominated antibody responses to EBNA1 similar to healthy children suggesting a selective loss of IFN-gamma secreting EBNA1-specific T cells in the presence of intact humoral immunity. CD8(+) T cell responses to EBV lytic and latent antigens not expressed in the tumors were similarly robust in eBL patients compared to healthy children. In addition, CD4(+) T cell responses to a malaria protein, merozoite surface protein 1, were present in lymphoma patients. This study demonstrates a selective loss of EBNA1-specific T cell responses in children with eBL and suggests a potential immunotherapeutic target for this EBV-associated lymphoma."
CD008122,0,19595360,0,Fever in returned travellers presenting in the United Kingdom: recommendations for investigation and initial management.,"International travel is increasing. Most physicians and general practitioners will encounter returned travellers with fever and the majority of travel-related infection is associated with travel to the tropics. In those returning from the tropics malaria must always be excluded, and HIV considered, from all settings. Common causes of non-malarial fever include from Africa rickettsial diseases, amoebic liver abscess and Katayama syndrome; from South and South East Asia, enteric fever and arboviral infection; from the Middle East, brucellosis and from the Horn of Africa visceral leishmaniasis. Other rare but important diseases from particular geographical areas include leptospirosis, trypanosomiasis and viral haemorrhagic fever. North and South America, Europe and Australia also have infections which are geographically concentrated. Empirical treatment may have to be started based on epidemiological probability of infection whilst waiting for results to return. The evidence base for much of the management of tropical infections is limited. These recommendations provide a pragmatic approach to the initial diagnosis and management of fever in returned travellers, based on evidence where it is available and on consensus of expert opinion where it is not. With early diagnosis and treatment the majority of patients with a potentially fatal infection related to travel will make a rapid and full recovery."
CD008122,0,16014858,1,False-positive results of a Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2-detecting malaria rapid diagnostic test due to high sensitivity in a community with fluctuating low parasite density.,"The persistence of parasite histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) in the circulation after parasite clearance has been considered a drawback for rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) targeting HRP2 and a major cause of false-positive results. This paper reports results of a study into whether a proportion of RDT HRP2 false-positive cases carried parasites using polymerase chain reaction analysis as the gold standard rather than microscopy. The high rate of RDT false-positive parasitemia results in comparison with microscopy was shown to predominantly represent cases that had a parasite density below the threshold for detection by microscopy. Despite the generally low disease-endemic prevalence of malaria in the area, there was a high prevalence of chronic infections with low, fluctuating, parasite densities that were better detected by RDT. Our results suggest that in areas known to have low-density parasitemias, RDTs targeting HRP2 may increase diagnostic sensitivity in comparison with microscopy. While microscopy remains the standard for comparison of malaria diagnostic accuracy, the limitations of microscopy, and the possibility that RDTs may have superior accuracy in some circumstances, should be taken into account when interpreting results of diagnostic trials."
CD008122,0,9684623,0,Assessing the incidence of infection with Plasmodium falciparum among international travelers.,"Circumsporozoite (CS) antibodies, indicating plasmodial infection but not necessarily development of disease, have been shown to be reliable indicators of transmission in endemic areas. To estimate the actual rate of plasmodial infection, the prevalence of CS antibodies was investigated by an ELISA test system in a selected population of 2,131 travelers returning from areas endemic for malaria who presented to an outpatient clinic without any apparent symptom or clinical sign of malaria. Serum specimens from 104 of the investigated 2,131 patients (4.9%) were found to be positive (titer > or = 6.25 international ELISA units [IEU]). The geometric mean titer of antibody concentrations (IEU) in seropositive patients was 18.64 IEU (95% confidence interval [CI] = 13.15-24.13), while it was 2.1 IEU (95% CI = 1.8-2.4) in seronegative patients. A significantly above average risk for plasmodial infection could be found among travelers to East Africa (risk ratio [RR] = 4.5, P < 0.001), West Africa (RR = 4.5, P < 0.001), and Southern Africa (RR = 3.2, P = 0.015), while areas with a comparatively low risk included Central America (RR = 0.86, P < 0.001), the Indian subcontinent (RR = 0.45, P = 0.015), South America (RR = 0.49, P = 0.091), East Asia (RR = 0.68, P = 0.441), West Asia (RR = 0.24, P = 0.099), and Southeast Asia (RR = 0.69, P = 0.094). The results of this study emphasize the importance of adequate malaria chemoprophylaxis in nonimmune travelers to endemic areas. By use of the described method, estimates of the true infection rate of malaria in travelers can be derived for certain areas and the value of prophylactic measures can be demonstrated."

However, the resultant effect of RDT-based diagnosis on fever management has been limited by lack of confidence in RDT results or the inability to act on results appropriately. If the utilisation of malaria RDTs is going to achieve the significant public health and financial benefits anticipated, they must be introduced in a carefully structured way and viewed as a tool for the management of febrile illness, not just malaria. If this is to occur, a re-think is required of the way many malaria programmes are funded and run."
CD008122,0,14996360,1,Short communication: An assessment of the use of malaria rapid tests by village health volunteers in rural Laos.,"Rapid malaria diagnosis, a key component of malaria control strategies, is hampered by the expense and training requirements of reliable microscopy. Rapid malaria antigen tests may improve the diagnosis of malaria in the rural tropics. After 1 h training 64 village health volunteers (VHVs) from rural Laos, with no previous laboratory experience, performed two malaria rapid diagnostic tests (ParacheckPf and OptiMAL) accurately. The reliability of six VHVs was assessed longitudinally, over 10 months with different frequencies of retraining. Compared with microscopy, error rates in dipstick interpretation were low (<2%) for both tests and were not associated with retraining frequency (P>0.2). Previously untrained Lao VHVs performed malaria rapid tests reliably with high sensitivity and specificity after minimal training."

This establishes the erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle that causes clinical disease resulting in 2-3 million deaths per year. We tested the hypothesis that a Plasmodium falciparum ligand, EBA-175 region II (RII), which binds its erythrocyte receptor glycophorin A during invasion, can be used as an immunogen to induce antibodies that block the binding of RII to erythrocytes and thereby inhibit parasite invasion of erythrocytes. Accordingly, we immunized mice, rabbits, and monkeys with DNA plasmids that encoded the 616 amino acid RII."
CD008122,0,12073732,0,Detection of vivax malaria sporozoites naturally infected in Anopheline mosquitoes from endemic areas of northern parts of Gyeonggi-do (Province) in Korea.,"We investigated population densities of mosquitoes infected with sporozoites in three highly epidemic areas of Josan-ri and Jangpa-ri (Paju City) and Dongjung-ri (Yeoncheon County) in Korea. Anopheline mosquitoes were collected from both indoors and outdoors by human baiting collection method during the period of the first week of June to the second week of September 1999. Total 13,296 female mosquitoes were collected and 8,650 (65.1%) were Anophelines. Thirty seven percent (3,199) of the Anopheline mosquitoes were captured outdoors and 63.9% (5,531) indoors. Employing a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we analyzed a total of 7,820 Anopheline mosquitoes and found that 7 Anopheline mosquitoes were infected with sporozoites. The positive rate in Josan-ri was 0.14% (5/3,500) and 0.15% (2/1,370) in Jangpa-ri. The total positive rate in all three surveyed areas was 0.09% (7/7,820). The mosquitoes infected with the sporozoites were detected on June 28th (n = 2), July 5th (n = 1), July 19th (n = 1), August 9th (n = 1), September 6th (n = 1), and the last one on September 13th (n = 1). They were all classified as Anopheles sinensis, which showed positive reaction in ELISA test. Therefore it might be concluded that Anopheles sinensis plays an important role in re-emerging malaria transmission in Korea."

CD008122,0,17650180,0,Naturally acquired antibodies to polymorphic and conserved epitopes of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3.,"Many studies on the role of merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) in immunity against malaria have focused on a conserved section of MSP3. New evidence suggests that polymorphic sequences within MSP3 are under immune selection. We report a detailed analysis of naturally-acquired antibodies to allele-specific and conserved parts of MSP3 in a Kenyan cohort. Indirect and competition ELISA to heterologous recombinant MSP3 proteins were used for antibody assays, and parasites were genotyped for msp3 alleles. Antibody reactivity to allele-specific and conserved epitopes of MSP3 was heterogeneous between individuals. Overall, the prevalence of allele-specific antibody reactivity was significantly higher (3D7-specific 54%, K1-specific 41%) than that to a recombinant protein representing a conserved portion of C-terminal MSP3 (24%, P < 0.01). The most abundant IgG subclass was IgG3, followed by IgG1. Allele-specific reactivity to the K1-type of MSP3 was associated with a lower risk of clinical malaria episodes during a 6-month follow-up in individuals who were parasitized at the start of the malaria transmission season (Relative risk 0.41 with 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.81, P = 0.011). The potential importance of allele-specific immunity to MSP3 should be considered in addition to immunity to conserved epitopes, in the development of an MSP3 malaria vaccine."

The pathogenesis of complicated malaria involves complex host-parasite interactions that include polarized cytokine responses. Recently, correlates between Th1-like and Th2-like cytokines, especially interleukin-10 (IL), IL-12, and TNF-alpha, and specific types of organ dysfunction have been noted. Here, we measured IL-10, IL-12, and for the first time, IL-15, in 19 patients aged 16-55 years old with complicated malaria on days 0 (admission), 3, 7, and 14. For analysis, patients were grouped together or sub-categorized into hyperparasitemias or cerebral malaria (CM). For IL-10, a dramatic increase was noted on admission, followed by a reduction toward control values that closely paralleled parasite clearance. For IL-12, modest but persistent increases were noted over the entire 14 day period that did not correlate with parasitemia. In general, especially on days 0 and 3, hyperparasitemic patients had, in comparison with CM patients, higher IL-10 and IL-12 levels. In contrast, IL-15 was generally below detection in most samples. These results provide further insight into the pathogenesis of complicated malaria by strengthening the contention that cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-12 are involved in modulating the immune response to P. falciparum."

Nevertheless, conflicting results have been obtained in determining whether this antibody specificity correlates with protection in residents of areas where malaria is endemic. In this study, we examined sera collected from a population of semi-immune individuals living in an area of Vietnam with meso-endemicity during a 6-month period. We used two Plasmodium falciparum parasite lines that express either endogenous MSP1(19) or the homologous region from Plasmodium yoelii to measure the MSP1(19)-specific inhibitory activity. We showed that (i) the level of MSP1(19)-specific inhibitory antibodies was not associated with a delay in P. falciparum infection, (ii) MSP1(19)-specific inhibitory antibodies declined significantly during the convalescent period after infection, and (iii) there was no significant correlation between the MSP1(19)-specific inhibitory antibodies and the total antibodies measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results have implications for understanding naturally acquired immunity to malaria and for the development and evaluation of MSP1(19)-based vaccines."
CD008122,0,9063360,1,Parasight F test compared with the polymerase chain reaction and microscopy for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in travelers.,"Imported malaria is an increasing problem worldwide. A rapid and accurate test for Plasmodium falciparum infection would facilitate the diagnosis of malaria in the returned traveler. The ParaSight F antigen capture assay (dipstick test) is a new diagnostic test for P. falciparum based on detection of circulating histidine-rich protein-2 antigen. We performed a blinded evaluation of this assay compared with microscopy and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of P. falciparum infection in 151 febrile travelers. Compared with the PCR, the dipstick test had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 97%. The ability of the dipstick test to detect P. falciparum was similar with that of microscopy (88% versus 83%) since the species of Plasmodium in 14 of 133 malaria-infected patients could not be determined by microscopy due to low parasite numbers. The dipstick test was 40% sensitive for infections with < 50 parasites/microliter, 89% with 50-100 parasites/microliter, and > or = 93% with > 100 parasites/microliter. Circulating antigen was detectable in 68% of the patients seven days after initiation of treatment and in 27% at day 28. The dipstick test represents a simple and accurate test for the diagnosis of P. falciparum infection in the returned traveler."

A circulating antigen of approximately Mr 33-35 kDa with good specificity and antigenicity, in the plasma of malarial patients was shown. Heating at 100 degrees C did not destroy its antigenicity. When fractions highly enriched in the 33-35 kDa proteins were used in ELISAs, a seroreactivity in plasma obtained from primary-infected individuals was found.

We measured the recognition of parasitized red blood cell membrane associated antigens by IgG in the plasma of clinically immune individuals by flow cytometry and ELISA. The plasmas were selected on the basis of preexisting IgG antibodies to pRBC membrane associated recombinant proteins. In every plasma sample IgG could bind the surface of live pRBCs in flow cytometry. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the level of IgG recognition of live pRBCs and of pRBC membrane ghost proteins or major identified antigens by ELISA. Flow cytometry thus represents a technique suitable to test for the accessibility and potential functionality of IgG antibodies directed to antigens expressed by the surface of pRBCs."

For a geometric mean +/-SD (Min;Max;range) parasitemia of 11,481 +/- 5.0 (88;713,838;713,750), the sensitivity of the KAT test was 96% (95% CI = 86-99.5), the specificity was 92% (95% CI = 80-99), the accuracy was 94% and the reliability was 85%.

The method consists of amplification by PCR of the DHFR gene followed by restriction enzyme digestion of codons 16 and 108. Three different enzymes are used to cut the wild-type, 108-threonine mutant, and 108-asparagine mutant gene. Since every natural antifolate-resistant isolate identified until now carries a mutation in codon 108, determination of the nature of this codon can predict the sensitivity of any P. falciparum isolate."
CD008122,0,7538540,0,Identification of T and B cell epitopes recognized by humans in the C-terminal 42-kDa domain of the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1.,"The 42-kDa, C-terminal region of the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium falciparum is a putative malaria vaccine candidate Ag. Nine synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted T cell sites of MSP-1 in blocks 15 and 16 and eight overlapping peptides representing the conserved block 17 were used to identify naturally immunogenic epitopes. These peptides were tested for their ability to induce proliferation of PBMC from residents in western Kenya, where malaria transmission is holoendemic. Six peptides (PL145, PL146, PL147, PL148, PL149, and PL150) from blocks 15 and 16 induced a positive proliferative response in > 30% of the individuals tested, and three peptides (PL151, PL152, and PL153) induced a proliferative response in < 25% of the donors. Among these peptides, PL146 was from the highly conserved region, PL150 was from a polymorphic region, and all other peptides were from a dimorphic region of blocks 15 and 16. In block 17, only three peptides, PL99, PL100, and PL103, induced proliferation in 30 to 37% of the volunteers. The rest of the peptides induced a proliferative response in approximately 13 to 25% of the donors. The plasma from these donors widely reacted with different allelic forms of 19-kDa recombinant proteins representing block 17 and recognized at least two linear B epitopes, PL104 and PL97. In summary, this study revealed that a majority of immunodominant T and B epitopes are localized in the conserved or dimorphic regions that are nonpolymorphic in the 42-kDa protein of MSP-1. This study suggests that incorporation of T epitopes from the dimorphic blocks 15 and 16 in a vaccine construct may be useful to ensure Ag-specific memory responses."
CD008122,0,18541764,1,Modeling the financial and clinical implications of malaria rapid diagnostic tests in the case-management of older children and adults in Kenya.,"Using data on clinical practices for outpatients 5 years and older, test accuracy, and malaria prevalence, we model financial and clinical implications of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) under the new artemether-lumefantrine (AL) treatment policy in one high and one low malaria prevalence district in Kenya. In the high transmission district, RDTs as actually used would improve malaria treatment (61% less over-treatment but 8% more under-treatment) and lower costs (21% less). Nonetheless, the majority of patients with malaria would not be correctly treated with AL. In the low transmission district, especially because the treatment policy was new and AL was not widely used, RDTs as actually used would yield a minor reduction in under-treatment errors (36% less but the base is small) with 41% higher costs. In both districts, adherence to revised clinical practices with RDTs has the potential to further decrease treatment errors with acceptable costs."
CD008122,0,12430867,0,New strategies for the diagnosis and screening of malaria.,"Thin and thick blood film microscopy are the ""gold standard"" for malaria diagnosis. In recent years, there have been important developments in malaria diagnostic tests including fluorescence microscopy of malaria parasites stained with acridine orange, dipstick immunoassays that detect species-specific parasite antigens, and more recently, detection of parasite nucleic acids after amplification by PCR. With some of these methods, sensitivities and specificities approaching and even exceeding those of the thin and thick film can be attained. In particular, PCR-based tests for plasmodium DNA or RNA are more sensitive and specific than other tests for malarial parasites. A specific application for PCR diagnosis of malaria could be blood donor screening. Clinical trials of blood donor sreening for malarial parasites by PCR are being conducted, in which pooled donor samples are screened to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Some of the new diagnostic methods may have specific applications in particular settings, depending on the purpose and location of testing, and other factors such as cost, desired sensitivity and specificity, speed and ease of use."

To identify these vectors in the State of Pará, Brazil, in a high-prevalence P. falciparum area, 565 anophelines were captured and identified while the seasonal variation and daily biting activity were determined. Of the seven anopheline species (An. strodei, An. albitarsis s.l., An. rondoni, An. darlingi, An. triannulatus, An. oswaldoi, and An. nuneztovari), the plasmodia circumsporozoite protein (CSP) was detected in three of them, with a total infection rate of 6.2%. An. darlingi was the most prevalent species (22.4%), followed by An. albitarsis (5.2%) and An. rondoni (3.6%). An. rondoni was found to be infected for the first time, which was also confirmed through PCR.

CD008122,0,9791038,0,Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes against malaria and tuberculosis: from natural immunity to vaccine design.,"1. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the liver stage of Plasmodium falciparum are intracellular pathogens which are potentially susceptible to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, a crucial component of the protective immune response to viral infections. Evidence from animal models points to a protective role for cytotoxic T-lymphocytes against M. tuberculosis and P. falciparum, but cytotoxic T-lymphocytes specific for these pathogens have been difficult to identify in man.2. Using a reverse immunogenetic approach, candidate epitopes from selected antigens of P. falciparum and M. tuberculosis were used to detect peptide-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses in individuals exposed to these pathogens. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was detected by the 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay and a sensitive ELISPOT assay for single-cell interferon-gamma release.3. In naturally exposed, partially immune Africans in The Gambia, eight largely conserved cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes in P. falciparum, restricted by several different HLA class I alleles, were identified. Several epitopes were also recognized in Tanzanians and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes recognized endogenously processed antigen.4. In tuberculosis patients with HLA-B52, a CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope was identified in ESAT-6, a secreted antigen specific for M. tuberculosis complex but absent in BCG. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes exhibited HLA-B52-restricted peptide-specific interferon-gamma release and lytic activity and recognized endogenously processed antigen.5. These studies demonstrate that CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes specific for mycobacterial and protozoal antigens are induced during natural infections in humans. The identification of these T-cells endorses current strategies to develop cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-inducing vaccines against P. falciparum and M. tuberculosis and highlights candidate antigens for inclusion in subunit vaccines."
CD008122,0,15899528,0,Biochemical characterization of the two nucleosome assembly proteins from Plasmodium falciparum.,"The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains two nucleosome assembly proteins, which we have termed PfNAPS and PfNAPL. We have over-expressed, purified and characterized these proteins using biochemical and biophysical techniques. PfNAPS and PfNAPL exist as dimers in solution and circular dichroism studies suggest that they may have different three-dimensional protein structures. ELISA-based binding data also suggest that PfNAPS and PfNAPL preferentially interact with the H3-H4 tetramer histones over H2A and H2B histones. We show that the parasite lysate phosphorylates only PfNAPL and this phosphorylation can be inhibited by heparin suggesting a potential role of casein kinase II in this process. Immuno-fluorescence experiments revealed that both PfNAPS and PfNAPL were expressed in all erythrocytic stages of the parasite. PfNAPL was predominantly localised in the cytoplasm in asexual and sexual stages of the parasite. PfNAPS did not co-localise with PfNAPL and was more intimately associated with the parasite nucleus, most strikingly in P. falciparum gametocytes. Taken together, our data show that although PfNAPS and PfNAPL share histone chaperone acitivities, they are regulated differently by phosphorylation and are spatially segregated within the parasite. These proteins are therefore likely to play non-redundant roles as nucleosome assembly motors in the parasite."
CD008122,0,15700753,0,Evaluation of the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA) for the determination of malaria transmission-reducing activity using empirical data.,"Host responses to the transmittable stages of the malaria parasite may reduce transmission effectively. Transmission-reducing activity (TRA) of human serum can be determined as a percentage, using the Standard Membrane Feeding Assay (SMFA). This laboratory assay was evaluated using the results of 121 experiments with malaria-endemic sera among which many repeated measurements were obtained. The assay consists of the feeding of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes with cultured Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes, mixed with human red blood cells, and control and experimental sera. The TRA of individual sera was determined by the comparison of oocyst densities between these sera. Bootstrap data on oocyst densities in individual mosquitoes in control feeds were used to construct confidence limits for TRA percentages of serum feeds. Low (<20%) and high TRA (>90%) values for individual sera were usually reproduced in a second experiment, whereas this was more difficult for values between 20% and 90%. The observed variability of TRA values is explained in part by the variability in oocyst density per mosquito. Oocyst densities in control feeds varied more between experiments than within experiments and showed a slight decline over the 3 years of experiments. Reproducibility of TRA of field sera was low (20%) between experiments, but much higher (61 %) within experiments. A minimum of 35 oocysts per mosquito in control feeds gave optimal reproducibility (44%) between experiments. We recommend that (1) sera are compared within an experiment, or (2) assays are only analysed where controls have at least 35 oocysts per mosquito. The SMFA is under the recommended conditions appropriate for the study of factors that may influence TRA, e.g. transmission blocking vaccines."
CD008122,0,8105816,0,Measurement of serum antibodies against native Leishmania gp63 distinguishes between ongoing and previous L. donovani infection.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using native gp63 for detection of serum antibodies to Leishmania was evaluated. The test identified antibodies in sera from 16 of 16 visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients and 9 of 12 sera from patients with Trypanosoma brucei infection. In comparison, sera from 80 Danish controls and 40 control donors from a malaria endemic area of Ghana without known exposure to Leishmania were negative, as were sera from 12 Kenyan malaria patients and 9 schistosomiasis patients. After cure of VL, sera rapidly became negative. Only 1 of 7, 1 of 21, and 1 of 27 sera from cured VL patients 6-12 months, 1-2 years and > 2 years after cure were positive. Thus, in contrast to other serological tests for VL, the gp63 ELISA seems to distinguish an ongoing from a past infection. This might prove useful both for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes."

CD008122,0,12950662,0,An estimation of the entomological inoculation rate for Ifakara: a semi-urban area in a region of intense malaria transmission in Tanzania.,"An entomological study on vectors of malaria and their relative contribution to Plasmodium falciparum transmission in the semi-urban area of Ifakara, south-eastern Tanzania, was conducted. A total of 32 houses were randomly sampled from the area and light trap catches (LTC) performed in one room in each house every 2 weeks for 1 year. A total of 147 448 mosquitoes were caught from 789 LTC; 26 134 Anopheles gambiae s.l., 615 A. funestus, 718 other anophelines and 119 981 culicines. More than 60% of the total A. gambiae s.l. were found in five (0.6%) LTCs, with a maximum of 5889 caught in a single trap. Of 505 A. gambiae s.l. speciated by polymerase chain reaction, 91.5% were found to be A. arabiensis. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests were performed on 10 108 anopheles mosquitoes and 39 (0.38%) were positive. Entomological inoculation rate (EIR) estimates were generated using a standard method and an alternative method that allows the calculation of confidence intervals based on a negative binomial distribution of sporozoite positive mosquitoes. Overall EIR estimates were similar; 31 vs. 29 [95% confidence interval (CI): 19, 44] infectious bites per annum, respectively. The EIR ranged from 4 (95% CI: 1, 17) in the cool season to 108 (95% CI: 69, 170) in the wet season and from 54 (95% CI: 30, 97) in the east of the town to 15 (95% CI: 8, 30) in the town centre. These estimates show large variations over short distances in time and space. They are all markedly lower than those reported from nearby rural areas and for other parts of Tanzania."

CD008122,0,12802828,0,Delayed clearance of Plasmodium falciparum in patients with human immunodeficiency virus co-infection treated with artemisinin.,"We investigated the effect of artemisinin on the rate of clearance of Plasmodium falciparum in patients with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. Initial mean (+/- SEM) parasite density was not different between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected groups (27,486 +/- 2,643 versus 32,892 +/- 6,583, respectively; P = 0.55). The mean (+/- SEM) time to clear 75% and 90% of the parasites was 23.1 hr +/- 1.8 and 29.3 hr +/- 1.9, respectively, for the HIV seropositive patients compared with 16.0 hr +/- 1.4 and 20.8 hr +/- 1.4, respectively for the HIV seronegative patients (P = 0.0075 and 0.0026, respectively). By 32 hr, almost all (6/7) HIV positive patients remained parasitemic in contrast with 2/12 HIV seronegative patients. Moreover, the mean parasite density was almost 12-fold higher in the HIV seropositive patients than in the HIV seronegative patients at the same period (1789 +/- 616 versus 150 +/- 118, respectively; P = 0.0037). Overall, the mean parasite clearance time was 37.7 hr +/- 2.1 in the HIV seropositive group and 30.0 hr +/- 2.1 in those who were HIV seronegative (P = 0.0284). Whereas mean fever clearance time was 40.6 hr +/- 2.4 for the HIV seropositive group, it was 28.7 hr +/- 1.2 for those who were HIV seronegative (P = 0.0001). These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that the host's immunity affects the activity of antimalarial drugs, and our data suggest for the first time that clearance of P. falciparum after administration of artemisinin is delayed in patients with HIV co-infection."
CD008122,0,7535817,0,Localization of HLA-A2.1-restricted T cell epitopes in the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum.,"Localization of human MHC class I-restricted T cell epitopes in the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum is an important objective in the development of antimalarial vaccines. To this purpose, we synthesized a series of overlapping synthetic 20-mer peptides, spanning the entire sequence of the 7G8 CS molecule except for the central repeat B cell domain. The P.f.CS peptides were first tested for their ability to bind to the human MHC class I HLA-A2.1 molecule on T2, a human cell line. Subsequently, the use of a series of shorter peptide analogues allowed us to determine the optimal A2.1 binding sequence present in several of the 20-mers. Binding P.f.CS peptides were further tested for their capacity to activate PBL from HLA-A2.1+ immune donors living in a malaria-endemic area. Specific IFN-gamma production was detected in the supernatant of cultures of PBL from exposed individuals. Cytotoxic T cell lines and clones were derived from the PBL of one responder, and their activity was shown to be HLA-A2.1-restricted and specific for the peptide 334-342 of the CS protein. In addition, double transgenic HLA-A2.1 x human beta 2-microglobulin mice were immunized with peptide 1-10 of the CS protein. T cells derived from immune lymph nodes displayed a peptide-specific HLA-A2.1-restricted cytolytic activity after one in vitro stimulation."
CD008122,0,8144206,0,Evaluation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the diagnosis of kala-azar in Malda district (West Bengal).,"An immunological test based on indirect (plate) ELISA has been successfully standardized and modified using promastigote soluble antigen. The test carried out on 813 subjects from a kala-azar endemic area (including parasitologically confirmed patients, subjects presenting with clinical symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis and endemic controls) and a non-endemic area (with diseases other than kala-azar and apparently normal subjects) was found to detect, specifically, antileishmanial antibodies. The plate ELISA has been simplified to a more sensitive dot-ELISA where the results are read within 2-3 h. The antigen requirement is 250 ng per test. No cross-reactivity with sera from patients of malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, amoebiasis and filariasis was observed. The follow up monitoring of antibodies in successfully treated kala-azar patients showed a decline of antibodies. A drop of blood taken on filter paper is sufficient to conduct the test. Dot ELISA therefore is a simple, inexpensive and stable test in serodiagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis."
CD008122,0,8544230,0,Dot-ELISA for human leptospirosis employing immunodominant antigen.,"A dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which uses a proteinase-K resistant antigen (PK-Dot-ELISA) to detect antileptospiral IgM antibodies was compared to the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). The assay was evaluated in serum samples from patients with leptospirosis (n = 89), typhoid fever (n = 10), malaria (n = 19), syphilis (n = 20), hepatitis (n = 16) and clinically healthy individuals (n = 92). The PK-Dot-ELISA presented a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 97.5%. The overall results of the PK-Dot-ELISA were similar to those of the MAT. However, the PK-Dot-ELISA was capable of detecting antibody activity in 43% of acute-phase sera which were negative by the MAT. Our data suggest that PK-Dot-ELISA can be used as an important portable field serodiagnostic assay for acute leptospirosis."
CD008122,0,6369119,0,Complement activation by the surface of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes.,"The surface of trophozoite-stage Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes will, in the presence of immune human or owl monkey serum, activate the classical complement pathway. This was demonstrated with a sensitive, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which detects the complex, C1s-C1 inhibitor, which is only generated when the classical pathway is activated. A second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as well as Covaspheres coated with affinity-purified anti-C3, showed that immune activation of the classical pathway by infected erythrocytes resulted in the accumulation of significant amounts of C3b on the erythrocyte surface. During the development of the parasite to the trophozoite stage, the erythrocyte membrane is also transformed from a non-activator into a surface capable of activating complement by the alternative pathway. Erythrocytes infected with trophozoite-stage parasites directly activated the alternative complement pathway. This activation led to the specific binding of an average of 15,000 C3b molecules per infected cell. Alternative pathway activation was augmented by anti-parasite antibody. Such conditions mediated the accumulation of an average of 36,000 C3b molecules per infected erythrocyte. The amounts of C3b on the infected erythrocyte surface did not lead to cellular lysis. They are, however, likely to have a major impact on the total in vivo response to this parasite."

CD008122,0,19434974,0,[Knowledge of traditional healers on malaria in Kendi (Bandiagara) and Finkolo (Sikasso) in Mali ].,"The survey has been carried out in the context of the project ""Traditional Practices and Primary Health Care"", developed by the Traditional Medicine Department (DMT) of the INRSP and the Swiss Ngo Antenna Technologies, with the support of Aidemet Ngo. The objective was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of traditional healers on uncomplicated and severe malaria, in the perspective of collaboration between traditional and modern medicine for the optimal care of the critical cases. The investigation has been conducted from January to February 2003 in the health areas of Kendié (Bandiagara District, Mopti Region) and Finkolo (Sikasso District and Region). The interviews concerned in total 79 traditional healers, 9 of which were women. The survey showed that the traditional healers have a good knowledge of the symptomatology of uncomplicated and severe malaria, and their diagnosis corresponds with that of the health workers who do not have access to laboratory analyses. On the other hand, the traditional etiology doesn't always correspond with the modern one, even if the traditional healers mention, among the causes of malaria, the mosquito bites. Most treatments were based on plant substances. We identified 66 medicinal species in total. The majority of them had already been studied for anti-plasmodial activity. We therefore investigated 8 of these plants, which had not previously been thoroughly studied. Extracts of different parts of these plants were tested on standard chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum; the most active plants were Argemone mexicana, Securinega virosa, Spondias mombin and Opilia celtidifolia, with IC50 ranging from 1.00 to 4.01 microg/ml."
CD008122,0,17336397,0,Multiple sclerosis and anti-Plasmodium falciparum innate immune response.,"Several epidemiological investigations conducted in Sardinia, insular Italy, indicate that the strong selective pressure of malaria along the centuries may have concurred to the elevated genetic MS-risk in this region. To test such hypothesis in an experimental setting, we have compared the immune response to P. falciparum (the causative agent of malaria) in Sardinian MS patients relative to their ethnic healthy controls and control MS patients of different ethnicity. To this purpose, the P. falciparum-driven peripheral mononuclear cell proliferation, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the innate immunity such as TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-12 and the ability to inhibit the parasite growth have been tested in relation to HLA-DR alleles and TNF promoter polymorphisms known of being associated to MS. We found that P. falciparum-induced proliferation, cytokine production and parasite killing are significantly augmented in Sardinian MS patients as compared to controls (p<0.01). Additionally, a correlation is found with genes associated to Sardinian MS, namely the TNF(-376A) promoter polymorphism and the class II HLA-DRB1*0405 allele. In conclusion, we have found evidences that some genetic traits formerly selected to confer a protective responses to P. falciparum now partially contribute to the elevated MS susceptibility amongst Sardinians."
CD008122,0,16237057,0,Durable human memory T cells quantifiable by cultured enzyme-linked immunospot assays are induced by heterologous prime boost immunization and correlate with protection against malaria.,"Immunological memory is a required component of protective antimalarial responses raised by T cell-inducing vaccines. The magnitude of ex vivo IFN-gamma T cell responses is widely used to identify immunogenic vaccines although this response usually wanes and may disappear within weeks. However, protection in the field is likely to depend on durable central memory T cells that are not detected by this assay. To identify longer-lived memory T cells, PBMC from malaria-naive vaccinated volunteers who had received prime boost vaccinations with a combination of DNA and/or viral vectors encoding the multiepitope string-thrombospondin-related adhesion protein Ag were cultured in vitro with Ag for 10 days before the ELISPOT assay. Ex vivo T cell responses peaked at 7 days after the final immunization and declined substantially over 6 mo, but responses identified after T cell culture increased over the 6-mo period after the final immunization. Moreover, individual cultured ELISPOT responses at the day of challenge time point correlated significantly with degree of protection against malaria sporozoite challenge, whereas ex vivo responses did not, despite a correlation between the peak ex vivo response and magnitude of memory responses 6 mo later. This cultured assay identifies long-lasting protective T cell responses and therefore offers an attractive option for assessments of vaccine immunogenicity."
CD008122,0,12135282,0,Short report: differential evolution of immunoglobulin G1/G3 antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum MSP1(19) over time in malaria-immune adult Senegalese patients.,"This study examined the evolution of immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG3 antibodies against the asexual stage Plasmodium falciparum protein, MSP1(19), before and after a heavy malaria transmission period in clinically immune Senegalese subjects living under different epidemiological conditions. Plasma was tested for antibodies to a yeast-produced, recombinant PfMSP1(19) antigen (the Q-KNG allelic variant) that has previously been demonstrated to react with IgG1, IgG3, or both in the majority of these people. Anti-P. falciparum antibodies of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, previously reported to be associated with protection, were shown to evolve independently one from another after the transmission period in both settings. These results suggest differential regulation of MSP1(19)-specific IgG1 and IgG3. The precise role of these antibody isotypes in maintaining malaria immunity remains to be determined."
CD008122,0,12135283,0,Short report: hepatitis b infection and severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Vietnamese adults.,"We investigated the prevalence of infection with hepatitis B virus among adult Vietnamese patients hospitalized for severe Plasmodiumfalciparum malaria. Sera from patients admitted with severe malaria in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, between May 1991 and January 1996 were assayed for hepatitis B surface antigen (HB(s)Ag) by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The overall prevalence of HB(s)Ag was 23.77% (77 of 324). This was higher than reported estimates of prevalence in the general catchment population for the study hospital (mean, 9.8%; range, 9-16%). No association was found between risk of death caused by severe malaria and HB(s)Ag. Patients admitted with cerebral malaria had a slightly greater risk of registering positive for HB(s)Ag (relative risk, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.58) relative to other manifestations of severe malaria. Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus may be a risk factor for severe malaria."

In this study, the in vitro activity of pyronaridine against clinical isolates of P. falciparum from Lambaréné, Gabon, was assessed in order to obtain baseline data on its activity prior to its future use in routine therapy.

CD008122,0,9070390,0,Evaluation of diagnostic tests for human leptospirosis.,"The IgM-PK-ELISA, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin M employing a proteinase K-treated antigen, and the ""Leptoteste-S"" macroagglutination test were evaluated for use in a rapid serodiagnosis of human leptospirosis. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was used as reference. The three serological tests were applied to serum samples from patients with leptospirosis (N = 89), typhoid fever (N = 8), malaria (N = 19), syphilis (N = 20), hepatitis (N = 16) and from clinically healthy donors (N = 92). The overall results of the IgM-PK-ELISA and the ""Leptoteste-S"" are comparable to those of the MAT. However, both tests differed statistically from MAT in terms of the positivity of the acute-phase sera, with approximately 38% of the patients with leptospirosis being identified earlier than when MAT was used. The IgM-PK-ELISA, with 89.9% sensitivity and 97.4% specificity, could be the test of choice for those laboratories which are equipped to perform ELISA. The ""Leptoteste-S"", with 89.9% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity, seems to be easier to perform and the most accessible to peripheral laboratories for rapid screening of human sera. Both techniques present the important characteristic of detecting early antibodies against leptospires, thus providing a diagnosis during the early stages of the disease."

Compared with 913 thick blood film examinations, the ParaSight-F test had 93.4% sensitivity and 98.2% specificity. Compared with 520 blood samples within the same study examined with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction, the ParaSight-F test had 91.6% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. The ParaSight-F test could be a valuable diagnostic tool for falciparum malaria in any situation requiring rapid diagnosis in the absence of microscopical examination."
CD008122,0,11716121,1,Comparison of methods for the rapid laboratory assessment of children with malaria.,"Rapid diagnosis and accurate quantification of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia are important for the management of malaria. The assessment of disease severity also depends on evaluation of metabolic indexes such as blood glucose and lactate concentrations. Here we describe an accurate and rapid alternative to conventional thick film examination (Lambaréné method). We also assess near-patient methods for measuring blood glucose (OneTouch) and lactate (Accusport). The accuracy of the Lambaréné method is similar to that of thin films. Results from the OneTouch glucose meter also are in good agreement with a YSI 2300 reference meter. Overall, the Accusport lactate meter agrees poorly with the YSI 2300 reference meter. However, the sensitivity and specificity to detect hyperlactatemia (blood lactate > or = 5 mmol/L) are 0.94 and 0.98, respectively."
CD008122,0,11716120,1,Detection of histidine rich protein 2 and panmalarial ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test antigens after chloroquine treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria does not reliably predict treatment outcome in eastern Indonesia.,"In regions with drug-resistant malaria, the ability to rapidly detect or predict treatment failure (TF) soon after a course of standard therapy for Plasmodium falciparum malaria would facilitate the prompt institution of second-line therapy. We thus evaluated longitudinally the ability of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv immunochromatographic test to predict treatment outcome. Sixty-six Sumbanese Indonesians with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were treated with chloroquine and followed for 28 days by use of 1997 World Health Organization criteria for assessment of therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs. The ICT Pf/Pv testing could be compared with microscopy in approximately half of the patients on each day of follow-up. Although strongly positive histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2) line intensities (equal to or greater than the control band) in convalescence were highly predictive of TF, any degree of positivity for the HRP2 and panmalarial antigens in convalescence was only moderately predictive of TE Positive predictive values of the HRP2 and panmalarial antigens for TF were 76.9% and 87.0%, respectively, on Day 3, 82.4% and 87.5% on Day 7, and 78.9% and 78.9% on Day 14. Negative HRP2 and panmalarial antigen results in convalescence were even less predictive of an adequate clinical response, and false-negative HRP2 and panmalarial antigen test results were found in one-sixth (6 of 37) of recrudescent infections diagnosed by microscopy among patients with late treatment failure. To reliably predict treatment outcome with rapid antigen tests, further development appears necessary to improve sensitivity for viable asexual parasites while avoiding detection of both gametocytes and persistent antigen in convalescence."
CD008122,0,2576160,0,Immunotechniques for epidemiology of malaria: appropriate tools for integration of primary health care with malaria research and control.,"Community-based malaria control with integrated primary health care appears to be the most feasible approach for endemic countries in their struggle against malaria. To plan and implement personal protection and vector control measures, there is the need for comprehensive information about local modes of transmission. Experience with insecticide-based vector control programmes and entomological data accumulated over the years has revealed vector systems of extraordinary heterogeneity, creating multifaceted transmission situations. The primary health care-system offers an appropriate structure to collect and evaluate microepidemiological information countrywide. Community and health workers trained and supervised by qualified personnel could be involved in the assessment of clinical, parasitological and entomological indices. Community participation is facilitated if personnel are taught the use of immunotechniques. Tests can be performed on dried material which allows samples to be stored for months without refrigeration, so that transport to and processing in a central laboratory are not subject to time constraints. This paper describes and discusses enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to determine if antibodies to sporozoites are present in blood collected as dried spots and to identify the origin of bloodmeals using dried mosquito abdomens."
CD008122,0,11791992,0,Economic advantage of a community-based malaria management program in the Brazilian Amazon.,"In the Brazilian Amazon, travel costs to centralized malaria clinics for diagnosis and treatment can approach 20% of one's monthly salary. A program was established in a mining town for community-based dipstick test diagnosis and treatment. An economic analysis was performed that compared expected costs under the old program to the observed costs of the new one. Data were obtained through interviews, government reports, clinic and hospital records, and community records. There was a 53% reduction (by 1,219 visits) of clinic visits but a doubling of malaria hospitalization admissions (to 191). The new program had an overall annual savings of $60,900 ($11.8K-$160K, sensitivity limits), a 77% reduction of the old program's cost. The benefit-to-cost ratio was 9:1, where benefits were patients' savings from travel and lost wages and costs were government drug, diagnostic, training, and monitoring expenses. A community-based program incorporating dipstick tests for malaria management can have economic advantages."
CD008122,0,11791990,0,Community-based program for malaria case management in the Brazilian Amazon.,"In areas of drug-resistant malaria, control programs may restrict chemotherapy until malaria has been confirmed via microscopy to contain costs and toxicity. In Brazil, patients travel to centralized laboratory posts (FNS) at great cost for diagnosis and treatment. A program was established through the bars of a mining town offering free dipstick diagnosis and mefloquine treatment on a 24-hr basis; falciparum malaria dipstick tests are accurate and easy to use. Outcomes were compared with historical data and results of a neighboring non-intervention village. Guidelines for dipstick use and treatment were followed for 98% of visits. The number of FNS visits was reduced from 2,316 (expected) to 1,097 (observed) with 626 dipstick tests applied. Ninety-five percent of those who visited the FNS experienced onset of malaria symptoms in the town where the FNS was located. There was an unexpected doubling of the malaria hospital admission rate. We demonstrate that dipstick testing can be used in a sustainable, community-based program that should be applicable in a wide variety of settings."

CD008122,0,8719161,0,Phenotype and genotype diversity in the circumsporozoite proteins of Plasmodium vivax in Thailand.,"Two phenotypes of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax occur in Thailand, each of which has a characteristic nonamer repeat: GDRA(A/D)GQPA for VK210-type and ANGAG-NQPG for VK247-type. We have sequenced the repetitive domains and flanking regions from 17 specimens collected from a small area, some of which had given ambiguous results in allele-specific hybridization or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Base substitutions occurred in non-random, limited patterns that suggest the dissemination of mutations by both unequal crossing-over and gene conversion; most substitutions were silent and phenotypic variation was relatively minor. Sequence variation and number of repeat units were much more variable in VK210-type clones than in those of VK247-type. Each VK210-type isolate with a poor ELISA response contained at least one clone with one of five residue substitutions not found in normally responsive isolates. The absence of obvious hybrid sequences between the two alleles suggests that most successful recombination may have been between sister chromatids, and the limited phenotypic variation suggests that CS antibody does not exert selective pressure on evolution."

A crude extract of a Trypanosoma brucei suspension which was purified from all blood components was used as antigen. In rabbits experimentally infected with T. brucei or T. rhodesiense both homologous (anti-T. brucei) and heterologous (anti-T. rhodesiense) Trypanosoma antibodies could be detected with ELISA using T. brucei as antigen. The sensitivity of ELISA was comparable with that of the immunofluorescence (IF) technique. Sera of patients with sleeping sickness were examined with ELISA and IF. It proved possible to discriminate between groups of individuals with and without trypanosomiasis. Cross reactions were only observed with serum from a patient in which antibodies to Leishmania were detected. No cross reactions were observed in sera from patients with malaria, toxoplasmosis, schistosomiasis, or echinococcosis. ELISA represents a good alternative to IF in the serology of African trypanosomiasis, and may be particularly suitable for mass screening purposes."
CD008122,0,17153692,0,Detection of malaria in Saudi Arabia by real-time PCR.,"Malaria transmission occurs in Saudi Arabia and mainly endemic in the lowlands of Asir region, the Southwester Province. Imported cases have been reported. Sensitive routine laboratory techniques for rapid and accurate malaria diagnosis are therefore desirable to facilitate the identification of individuals infected with the malarial parasites and to follow up the progress of treatment of such cases with appropriate drugs. Traditional diagnosis, based on the microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin films remains the main standard method of diagnosis used for malaria diagnosis in Saudi Arabia. Molecular diagnostic techniques based on the detection of nucleic acids (as PCR; Real-time PCR) are now highly considered. Real time-PCR a new methodology has been recently applied to detect human malaria. In this study a total of forty four samples, using whole-blood, dried blood and thick smears were examined by PCR and Real-time PCR. Both techniques showed a higher sensitivity than the microscopy. Parasites were detected in twenty nine samples out of forty four, compared to twenty six of thirty nine were positive with thin blood film. The real-time PCR assay offers a practical and positive alternative for rapid and accurate diagnosis for malaria infection. The application of such technique will be significantly valuable especially for screening for malaria infection in endemic areas."
CD008122,0,11129562,0,Effect of serum dilution in diagnosis of malaria in community.,"Recently, it has been shown that immunological methods can be used for the diagnosis of malaria other than sero-epidemiology. A study has been done to investigate optimum binding capacity of antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) at different serum dilutions. For validating antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) reaction at 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:1000 serum dilutions, have been tested in two different laboratories to establish validation of the ELISA method. Inter laboratory test on synthetic peptide (RI) ELISA was found comparable and meaningful for assessing malaria transmission in defined locality at 1:100 dilution. Results also showed that 1:1000 serum dilution can be useful for diagnostic purpose."
CD008122,0,8842983,0,A quantitative cell-ELISA for alpha-galactose specific antibodies in human malaria.,"Naturally occurring antibodies to alpha-linked galactose (anti- gal) has been reported to be present in large quantities in normal human sera and they seem to play an important role in a variety of infectious as well as autoimmune diseases. A cell-ELISA using glutaraldehyde fixed normal rabbit erythrocytes was developed for quantification of anti-gal in human sera. This assay was compared with three other(commonly used) immunoassays viz. a) agglutination b) enhanced agglutination and c) lipid ELISA-assays for detection of anti-gal in human sera. The cell-ELISA was found to be the most sensitive assay followed by lipid-ELISA, enhanced agglutination and agglutination assay in decreasing order. Anti-gal affinity purified through a column of melibiose-agarose was tested by cell-ELISA. Monolayers of RRBC pre-treated with alpha-galactosidase was not reactive while in monolayers treated with beta-galactosidase, the anti-gal reactivity was comparable to those in untreated RRBC monolayer, thus indicating the high specificity of cell-ELISA for detection of antibodies to alpha-linked galactose."
CD008122,0,17984362,0,Loop-mediated isothermal PCR (LAMP) for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria.,"A recently described loop-mediated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (LAMP) for molecular detection of Plasmodium falciparum was compared with microscopy, PfHRP2-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the ""gold standard"" in 115 Bangladeshi in-patients with fever. DNA extraction for LAMP was conducted by conventional methods or simple heating of the sample; test results were either assessed visually or by gel electrophoresis. Conventional DNA extraction followed by gel electrophoresis had the highest agreement with the reference method (81.7%, kappa = 0.64), with a sensitivity (95% CI) of 76.1% (68.3-83.9%), comparable to RDT and microscopy, but a specificity of 89.6% (84.0-95.2%) compared with 100% for RDT and microscopy. DNA extraction by heat treatment deteriorated specificity to unacceptable levels. LAMP enables molecular diagnosis of falciparum malaria in settings with limited technical resources but will need further optimization. The results are in contrast with a higher accuracy reported in an earlier study comparing LAMP with a non-validated PCR method."

Purified recFeSOD was found to be enzymatically active as determined by (i) inhibition of ferri-cytochrome c reduction, (ii) dismutation of superoxide anions generated by human neutrophils and (iii) inhibition of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. The enzymatic properties of recFeSOD were similar to those of the native protein in trophozoite extracts. In an ELISA using recFeSOD as antigen, 96% of sera from patients having invasive amebiasis were reactive whereas none of the healthy controls or of patients suffering from malaria, bacterial or viral infections were reactive. Only sera of Toxoplasma-, Leishmania- or Trypanosoma-infected individuals exhibited partial cross-reactivity to recFeSOD."
CD008122,0,17017232,0,Bloodmeal hosts of Anopheles species (Diptera: Culicidae) in a malaria-endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon.,"Hosts of blood-fed anophelines (Diptera: Culicidae) were determined in three riverine villages, 1.5-7.0 km apart, along the Matapí River, Amapá state, Brazil, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay midgut analysis for IgG of common vertebrates. Anopheles marajoara Galvão & Damsceno and Anopheles darlingi Root had higher human blood indices (HBI) than Anopheles nuneztovari Gabaldón, Anopheles triannulatus (Neiva and Pinto), and Anopheles intermedius (Chagas), which were relatively zoophilic. HBIs of An. darlingi varied significantly among villages, attributable to a low proportion of human-fed mosquitoes in Santo Antônio. Significantly higher incidence of An. marajoara and An. nuneztovari fed on pig blood at two villages, associated with a low number of pigs in Santo Antônio. The incidences of bovine blood varied significantly among villages for all three of the most common anopheline species. The incidence of mixed meals ranged from 7.1 to 27.6% among common species, and, for An. marajoara, varied significantly among villages. This study demonstrates differences in host selection patterns among villages only a few kilometers apart, which may be influenced by host availability and have important epidemiological consequences."
CD008122,0,7906328,1,Diagnosis of malaria by detection of Plasmodium falciparum HRP-2 antigen with a rapid dipstick antigen-capture assay.,"Two field studies in Kenya and an experimental challenge study in the USA were done to assess the accuracy of a dipstick antigen-capture assay based on qualitative detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2) in peripheral blood for diagnosis of P falciparum infection. In these studies, the assay was 96.5-100% sensitive for detection of greater than 60 P falciparum asexual parasites/microL blood, 70-81% sensitive for 11-60 parasites/microL blood, and 11-67% sensitive for 10 parasites or less/microL blood. Specificity was 95% (95% CI 85-105%; n = 20) among naive American volunteers, 98% (96-101%; n = 112) among volunteers exposed to the bite of P falciparum-infected mosquitoes, and 88% (84-92%; n = 285) among Kenyans living in an area with holoendemic malaria. Our results also indicated that PfHRP-2 antigen was not detectable in blood 6 days after initiation of curative chemotherapy, and suggest that such circulating antigens rarely lead to false-positive tests. The dipstick assay's sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and speed may make it an important tool in the battle against malaria."
CD008122,0,9230470,0,Improved detection of human antibodies to a Plasmodium antigen using a peptide modified with Aib residues.,"A 17-mer sequence was selected as a model to study the influence of modifications of terminal ends both on the conformational of a peptide and on its antigenicity towards naturally developing antibodies. This sequence corresponded to a tandemly repeated motif, found in a long repetitive region, with high helical propensity, of a Plasmodium falciparum liver-stage antigen (LSA-1), immunogenic in man. Our model peptide was synthesized with ionizable or non-ionizable ends, or modified in both extremities by introduction of the helix-promoting residue alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib). Helical contribution, absent in the 17 amino-acid sequence possessing ionizable ends, was detectable when non-ionizable ends were introduced, and dramatically increased in the Aib-modified analogue. The presence of ionizable ends totally abolished reactivity towards human sera, otherwise detectable with the peptide possessing non-ionizable ends. While modification by Aib residues was neither detrimental nor beneficial to antigenicity in solution, it clearly resulted in an improved sensitivity of the specific antibody detection when used as solid-phase antigen in ELISA."

In the African sample the seroprevalence rate was 3.5%; the age range from 19 to 30 years was most affected; prevalence differences between the sexes were slight (3.5% for the males vs 3% for the females); the evaluation of the medical history (STDs, malaria, TB and hospital stays) showed no statistically significant association with HIV-1 infection; the central-eastern Africa significantly appeared the most affected."
CD008122,0,12596444,0,[Comparison between OptiMAL and the thick smear tests for malaria diagnosis in an endemic area during a non-epidemic period].,"The capacity of Optimal to diagnose malaria was compared with the thick smear test in two representative samples, one with acute febrile syndrome (AFS) n = 107, and another diagnosed by thick smear test (AFS + M) n = 82. The samples were chosen from patients at the malaria diagnostic clinic in Turbo, Antioquia, Colombia, between June and August 2000. The study was designed to be descriptive, prospective, and cross-sectional. The two tests were applied simultaneously in the AFS group (parallel, double blind design), and in sequential form in the AFS + M group. The thick smear test was the standard test. Optimal tests were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the parallel design, Optimal showed, for Plasmodium falciparum, a sensitivity of 40% [95% CI: 18-67], a specificity of 98% (95% CI: 92-100) and positive and negative predictive values of 75% (95% CI: 36-96) and 91% (95% CI: 83-96%), respectively. For Plasmodium vivax, it showed a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI: 82-100), a specificity of 89% (95% CI: 80-95) and positive and negative predictive values of 79% (95% CI: 62-90) and 98% (95% CI: 91-100). With the sequential design, Optimal showed a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI: 52-79) and 97% (95% CI: 83-100) for P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. For P. falciparum, the sensitivity was directly proportional to the parasitemia, while the sensitivity for P. vivax was independent from the parasitemia. The diagnostic values and operative characteristics of the thick smear test surpassed the Optimal test in its sensitivity for P. falciparum; the specificities were similar. Both tests were nearly identical in their diagnostic capacity for P. vivax. These results recommend that the thick smear test be retained as a routine or reference test for malaria diagnosis, with Optimal used as an ancillary test."
CD008122,0,2065453,0,[Fusion protein Dot-ELISA for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum antibodies].,"The feasibility of using fusion protein Dot-ELISA to detect the antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum was presented. Fusion protein expressed in the P. falciparum genomic DNA expression library with lambda gt11 was used as the antigen to coat the solid support nitrocellulose strips. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated with goat antihuman IgG was used as the second antibody. The enzyme activity was read by naked eyes according to the dot colour. The results by Dot-ELISA correlated well with those by IFA. The study indicated that this method was specific, sensitive, simple, and replicable. It would be valuable for further studying the usefulness of fusion protein in the immunodiagnosis of malaria."

CD008122,0,7943570,0,Plasmodium vivax: immune responses in a cross-section of the population in the Delhi area of India.,"The immune status of the individuals living in the Delhi area of northern India where Plasmodium vivax is predominant is described. The majority of the individuals who were acutely infected with P. vivax had antibodies against crude blood-stage antigen and the recombinant antigen, PV9. In contrast, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the majority of these individuals did not show proliferation in the presence of either of these antigens. There was no correlation between antibody levels and T cell proliferation. Such an immune status of individuals living in endemic areas should be taken into account in the future in developing P. vivax malaria vaccines."
CD008122,0,18625058,0,Evaluation of immunoglobulin purification methods and their impact on quality and yield of antigen-specific antibodies.,"Antibodies are the main effectors against malaria blood-stage parasites. Evaluation of functional activities in immune sera from Phase 2a/b vaccine trials may provide invaluable information in the search for immune correlates of protection. However, the presence of anti-malarial-drugs, improper collection/storage conditions or concomitant immune responses against other pathogens can contribute to non-specific anti-parasite activities when the sera/plasma are tested in vitro. Purification of immunoglobulin is a standard approach for reducing such non-specific background activities, but the purification method itself can alter the quality and yield of recovered Ag-specific antibodies."
CD008122,0,2700844,0,Dot-immunobinding assay (DIBA) with integral Plasmodium falciparum as antigen in immuno-diagnosis of falciparum malaria.,"Among the available immuno-diagnostic methods of parasitoses, dot-immunobinding assay (DIBA) has been proved to be promising for its high sensitivity and specificity, easy performance, lack of need of special equipment, and consequently its practical usage in field work. In previously reported tests, soluble antigen was used, thus a sonicator and an ultracentrifuge were required to produce the antigen. This paper reports the application of integral P. falciparum as antigen in DIBA to detect antibodies in falciparum malaria cases. Of 52 sera from falciparum malaria patients tested, 49 (94.2%) showed positive reactions, which was similar to the result using soluble antigen in DIBA (96.2%) and was higher than that in IFA (86.5%) and ELISA (80.8%). No false positive was revealed in 48 control sera from healthy individuals and sera from visceral leishmaniasis, paragonimiasis, fasciolopsiasis and schistosomiasis patients."

On the basis of two case reports problems of the diagnosis and of the correlation of psychiatric disorders with the medication are discussed. Particularly are an analysis of the development of the ADR and a comparison of the psychiatric symptoms with known ADR-cases and with other psychiatric diseases important. This seems to be significant for an optimal treatment as well as for the assessment of the prognosis.
CD008122,0,9921412,0,Binding of HIV-1 to RBCs involves the Duffy antigen receptors for chemokines (DARC).,"The Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) belongs to a family of erythrocyte chemokine receptors that bind C-X-C and C-C chemokines such as interleukin 8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and regulated-on-activation, normal T cell-expressed and -secreted (RANTES), but not macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) or MIP-1 beta. DARC has also been identified to a receptor for malaria parasites Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi. In the present study, we show that HIV-1 binds to RBCs from Caucasian individuals via DARC making RBCs able to transmit HIV to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, binding of HIV-1 particles to RBCs is inhibited by treating these cells with recombinant RANTES, but not with recombinant MIP-1 alpha prior to their incubation with HIV-1. This finding suggests that RBCs may function as a reservoir for HIV-1 or as a receptor for the entry of HIV-1 into CD4-cell subsets as well as neurons or endothelial cells."
CD008122,0,12812358,1,Performance of the OptiMAL test for malaria diagnosis among suspected malaria patients at the rural health centers.,"The OptiMAL test detects both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria infections. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the OptiMAL test at the Basic Health Units (BHUs) and the District Health Quarter (DHQ) Center in rural villages of Punjab, Pakistan that provide minimal health services. Two sets of blood specimens obtained from 930 suspected malaria patients attending these BHUs were tested at BHUs and the DHQ Center by microscopy and the OptiMAL test. At the BHUs, 231 (25%) of the patients were positive by microscopy and 278 (30%) patients tested positive by the OptiMAL test. At the DHQ Center, microscopic analysis of a second set of specimens from the same patients confirmed the malaria infection in 386 (42%) patients and the OptiMAL test result was positive in 300 (32%) patients. To determine the performance of OptiMAL test at the BHUs and the DHQ Center, all data were compared with microscopy results obtained at the DHQ Center. The OptiMAL test results for P. falciparum at the BHUs were comparable to those of the OptiMAL test at the DHQ Center. However, the sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the OptiMAL test were considerably lower for P. vivax infections than for P. falciparum infections, irrespective of whether the test was performed at the BHUs or at the DHQ Center (P. falciparum: sensitivity = 78-85%, PPV = 89-97%, NPV = 96-98%; P. vivax: sensitivity = 61-76%, PPV = 88-95%, NPV = 90-93%). The OptiMAL test also detected a number of false-positive and false-negative results at both the BHUs and the DHQ Center. The false-positive results ranged from 1% to 2%; however, the number of false-negative results was much higher (BHUs: P. falciparum = 22%, P. vivax = 39%; DHQ Center: P. falciparum = 15%, P. vivax = 24%). In conclusion, these results, when combined with other advantages of the OptiMAL test, suggest that this test can be used by relatively inexperienced persons to diagnose malaria infection in rural areas where facilities for microscopy are not available."
CD008122,0,11293505,1,Evaluation of diagnostic methods of re-emerging malaria in Korean patients.,"Malaria is one of the most important parasitic diseases especially in tropical areas. Over 300 million people are affected and the condition causes 1-3 million deaths each year. It is transmitted by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Although Korea was declared to be free of Malaria by the WHO in 1979, malaria re-emergence has been apparent since 1993 amongst soldiers located near the De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) in the northern part of the country. Conventional microscopic examination of thin and thick blood films demonstrates the presence of the parasite and thus this method has been used to confirm the diagnosis of malaria, but it is a labor-intensive procedure and relies upon subjective interpretation. To overcome these limitations, fast and reliable methods for malaria detection have been recently introduced. In this study, we compared three kinds of antibody detection kits and one biochemical test kit that determines the presence of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) with conventional peripheral blood smears. The antibody detection methods examined were, two rapid test pack format methods and a single microplate format enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, as manufactured by Korean companies. The sensitivities of the three commercial antibody detection kits in the early stage of malaria were 70.8%, 77.4%, and 63.6%, their corresponding specificities 90.5%, 91.8%, and 80.9%, and their accuracies 87.6%, 87.0%, and 76.7%. The sensitivity and specificity of the pLDH assay were 100% apiece and the results were in 100% concordance with the microscopy of thick blood films. Thus, the pLDH assay may be used as an alternative for conventional microscopic blood film examination, especially in emergency situations when prompt treatment is necessary."
CD008122,0,2122747,0,Widespread reactivity of human sera with a variant repeat of the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium vivax.,"A panel of Brazilian and Indian sera was screened for reactivity with a variant strain of Plasmodium vivax recently isolated in Thailand. This strain has been shown to have a unique repeat region which differs from the previously described P. vivax CS proteins. A total of 21/343 human sera were found to react with a synthetic peptide representing the variant P. vivax repeat. All of the sera that reacted with the variant repeat peptide, (ANGAGNQPG)4, also reacted with variant P. vivax sporozoites. Both the anti-peptide and the antisporozoite reactivity were totally abolished by adsorption with the variant peptide. Some of the human sera contained variant antibodies that were species specific and could only be adsorbed with the specific variant peptide. These findings suggest that the variant strain of P. vivax might have a worldwide distribution. We also found that some of the variant positive sera reacted with P. brasilianum sporozoites and with the P. brasilianum/P. malariae CS repeat. The adsorption of these sera with the P. brasilianum/P. malariae repeat peptide, (NAAG)4, significantly reduced the reactivity of these sera with the P. vivax variant. In addition, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies of mice immunized with P. brasilianum sporozoites cross-reacted with the variant P. vivax CS. These findings suggest that exposure to P. brasilianum or P. malariae may give rise to sporozoite antibodies which cross-react with the P. vivax variant CS."
CD008122,0,3513640,0,"Field trial in Chiapas, Mexico, of a rapid detection method for malaria in anopheline vectors with low infection rates.","A method consisting of filtration of up to 100 macerated mosquitoes in a batch, followed by fixation with glutaraldehyde and concentration of filtrate by centrifugation has been developed to rapidly assess malaria infection in anopheline mosquitoes. Determination of the presence of sporozoites is made by observation of a sample of the final filtrate with a phase microscope. The method is simple and field adaptable, essential factors for the application of any technique to large scale field operations. Application of the technique in El Gancho, Chiapas, Mexico, in February 1984 yielded an infection rate for Anopheles albimanus of 0.9% for intradomicile-collected human bait mosquitoes and 0.1% for peridomicile-collected human bait mosquitoes."

CD008122,0,15491469,0,Serum levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor is associated with parasitemia in children with acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection.,"Serum levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) are significantly elevated and of prognostic value in patients suffering from serious infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Our objective was to investigate suPAR levels during symptomatic malaria infection and 7 days after treatment. Children younger than 6 years who presented with fever or other symptoms compatible with malaria were enrolled. Blood films and samples were collected on day 0 and day 7. Twenty-five children were allocated to each of three groups according to the amount of Plasmodium falciparum detected in their initial blood film. Children in group 1 had parasite densities in excess of 20 parasites per 200 leucocytes. The median plasma suPAR level was 6.49 ng/mL (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.90-7.61) and correlated to parasitemia (Spearman 0.43, P < 0.0001). Blood was obtained from 20 children in group 1 after 7 days of treatment. All became malaria negative in their blood slides and all decreased in suPAR level to median 3.48 ng/mL (IQR: 3.08-3.91) (P < 0.0001). Group 2 consisted of 25 children with 1-20 parasites in their blood slide. The suPAR level was median 2.91 ng/mL (IQR: 2.27-4.40) and decreased with median 0.5 ng/mL following treatment (P = 0.0002). Group 3 showed to be negative in their blood slides and most received antibiotic treatment. suPAR decreased from median 3.26 ng/mL (IQR: 2.77-4.46) to median 2.47 ng/mL (IQR: 2.01-3.75), on day 7 (P = 0.006). This study demonstrates an important association between suPAR and acute malaria infection in humans."
CD008122,0,17015460,0,Limited cross-reactivity among domains of the Plasmodium falciparum clone 3D7 erythrocyte membrane protein 1 family.,"The var gene-encoded Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family is responsible for antigenic variation and sequestration of infected erythrocytes during malaria. We have previously grouped the 60 PfEMP1 variants of P. falciparum clone 3D7 into groups A and B/A (category A) and groups B, B/C, and C (category non-A). Expression of category A molecules is associated with severe malaria, and that of category non-A molecules is associated with uncomplicated malaria and asymptomatic infection. Here we assessed cross-reactivity among 60 different recombinant PfEMP1 domains derived from clone 3D7 by using a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a pool of plasma from 63 malaria-exposed Tanzanian individuals. We conclude that naturally acquired antibodies are largely directed toward epitopes varying between different domains with a few, mainly category A, domains sharing cross-reactive antibody epitopes. Identification of groups of serological cross-reacting molecules is pivotal for the development of vaccines based on PfEMP1."
CD008122,0,10588766,0,Maintenance and sustained use of insecticide-treated bednets and curtains three years after a controlled trial in western Kenya.,"In large experimental trials throughout Africa, insecticide-treated bednets and curtains have reduced child mortality in malaria-endemic communities by 15%-30%. While few questions remain about the efficacy of this intervention, operational issues around how to implement and sustain insecticide-treated materials (ITM) projects need attention. We revisited the site of a small-scale ITM intervention trial, 3 years after the project ended, to assess how local attitudes and practices had changed. Qualitative and quantitative methods, including 16 focus group discussions and a household survey (n = 60), were employed to assess use, maintenance, retreatment and perceptions of ITM and the insecticide in former study communities. Families that had been issued bednets were more likely to have kept and maintained them and valued bednets more highly than those who had been issued curtains. While most households retained their original bednets, none had treated them with insecticide since the intervention trial was completed 3 years earlier. Most of those who had been issued bednets repaired them, but none acquired new or replacement nets. In contrast, households that had been issued insecticide-treated curtains often removed them. Three (15%) of the households issued curtains had purchased one or more bednets since the study ended. In households where bednets had been issued, children 10 years of age and younger were a third as likely to sleep under a net as were adults (relative risk (RR) = 0. 32; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.19, 0.53). Understanding how and why optimal ITM use declined following this small-scale intervention trial can suggest measures that may improve the sustainability of current and future ITM efforts."
CD008122,0,15077420,0,[Comparison of techniques used to screen blood donations for malaria antibodies].,"In France all but one of the serological tests used to screen blood donations rely on ELISA-based techniques. The exception is malaria antibody detection that is performed by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique using commercially available kits. The reagent kit used at the French Army Blood Bank (FABB) is Falciparum-Spot IF (bioMerieux). However since the antigens in this kit are obtained from group A1 red blood cell cultures, false positive results can occur due to binding of natural antiglobulins. Over a 10-month period at the FABB, we disqualified a total of 55 donations (5.02% of total donations) because of positive Falciparum-Spot IF@1000 test results. Most disqualified donations (84%) involved donations with group O red blood cells. In the present retrospective study, these 55 disqualified donations were used to compare the specificity of three other serological tests used for detection of malaria antibodies: Falciparum-SpotIF after elimination of natural antiglobulins by absorption and neutralization with Witebski reagent and Paludix (Diagast). Use of all three techniques provided a specificity gain of over 87% but elimination using Witebski reagent led to a loss of sensitivity. At the FABB we have been using the Falciparum-Spot IF kit after elimination of natural antiglobulins since April 2001. Only 1.62% of donations tested have been disqualified due to the presence of malaria antibodies including 52% with group O red blood cells."

In all, 1,231 patients with fever were screened in parallel with the taking of thick blood smears. The sensitivity and specificity of the dipstick test for detection of P. falciparum were 93% and 92.5%, respectively. Results also indicate that the dipstick test result became negative within seven days after initiation of curative chemotherapy in the majority of cases (95%). Tribal populations in remote forested areas are important reservoirs of P. falciparum that are mostly resistant to standard antimalarial drugs and a source of malaria to the rest of the country. Control of malaria is limited by inaccessibility, lack of medical services, public ignorance of the disease, and other technical problems. In this population, the dipstick assay was found to be highly accurate, simple, and rapid, suggesting that it may be used in remote forested areas without the need for microscopic examination. The simplicity of the dipstick test enabled administration of more effective and expensive antimalarials preventing further buildup and dissemination of resistant parasites and a return of symptoms."
CD008122,0,15847975,0,Where there is no state: household strategies for the management of illness in Chad.,"The current structure of the health care system in Chad, which is characterized by a weak public health system and a nascent and largely unaffordable private sector, raises questions about how low-income households manage illnesses. These questions are also compelling because of claims about the potential of oil-related investments to restructure the current landscape of care over the next 25-30 years. This paper focuses on household strategies for treating episodes of malaria reported in an on-going, longitudinal study of household health and access to care in Chad. Treatment of malaria outside the health care system is widespread in endemic areas, therefore it is not surprising that low-income households in this study rely heavily on unregulated drug markets for care. However, the paper shows how self-medication and the use of these drug markets are shaped by the current organization and delivery of care, and are not simply the outcome of a lack of information about the dangers associated with such practices. The paper also shows the consequences of this particular constellation of services for health in low-income households. We see, for example, the emergence of regimes for managing illness that consist of keeping debilitating symptoms at bay through the use of intermittent, sub-optimal therapies that provide a temporary reprieve but not a 'cure.' We also see that households ignore health problems--absorbing them into the experience of everyday life--that might elsewhere demand attention. When illnesses appear as crises it is often because cash-strapped households are unable to sustain this type of management regime, and easily treatable problems spiral out of control. Whether and how the experiences of the low-income households described in this paper will be impacted by the public investment of oil revenues in the health sector is the question our longitudinal study is designed to address."
CD008122,0,10774643,0,Low CD8+ T lymphocyte response to P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein in naturally-exposed malaria endemic populations in Thailand.,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for epitope(s) within the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of malaria sporozoite have been shown to play an important role in protective immunity against malaria. Human CTLs against the potential epitope at the carboxy terminal region of CS protein of Plasmodium falciparum 7G8 strain (Pf7G8CS 368-390) were determined in thirty-six falciparum malaria patients and ten healthy controls. Four of 36 individuals and none of the healthy controls developed Pf7G8CS 368-390 specific CTL activity. The CTL activity was antigen specific and CD8+ T cell dependent. Although low CTL response has been determined, the study suggested that there was a correlation between initial parasitemia and the specific Pf7G8CS 368-390 CTL activity. A correlation between such CTL activity and anti-R32tet32 antibody levels among individuals with previous malaria experience was found, which was in contrast to those among individuals with recent malaria infection. All these 4 CTL positive individuals had at least two episodes of clinical malaria experience while all 25 individuals who were exposed to malaria for the first time did not have such a specific CTL response. These results showed that individuals with a history of natural endemic exposure to P. falciparum sporozoite developed low specific CTL responses to Pf7G8CS 368-390, so that previous but recent sporozoite exposure might be a prerequisite for generation of such CS protein specific CTL response."

CD008122,0,12244052,0,"Serine repeat antigen (SERA5) is predominantly expressed among the SERA multigene family of Plasmodium falciparum, and the acquired antibody titers correlate with serum inhibition of the parasite growth.","The Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen (SERA) is one of the blood stage malaria vaccine candidates. The malaria genome project has revealed that SERA is a member of the SERA multigene family consisting of eight SERA homologues clustered on chromosome 2 and one SERA homologue on chromosome 9. Northern blotting and real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR with five independent parasite strains, including three allelic representative forms of the SERA gene, have shown that all of the SERA homologues are transcribed most actively at trophozoite and schizont stages and that SERA5 (SERA/SERP) is transcribed predominantly among the family. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant proteins representing the N-terminal portions of four significantly transcribed SERA homologues (SERA3 to -6) in the center of the cluster on chromosome 2. Using these antibodies, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy detected the expression of SERA3 to -6, with similar localization, in all trophozoite- and schizont-infected erythrocytes. We have examined 40 sera from Ugandan adults for their antibody reactivity and found that enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer against SERA5 N-terminal domain, but not against other SERA proteins, is positively correlated with the inhibition of in vitro parasite growth by individual sera. Our data confirm the usefulness of the N-terminal domain of SERA5 as a promising malaria candidate vaccine."
CD008122,0,12164291,1,Field evaluation of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv immunochromatographic test for the detection of asymptomatic malaria in a Plasmodium falciparum/vivax endemic area in Thailand.,"Rapid antigen assays provide an effective tool for the detection of malaria in symptomatic patients. However, the efficacy of these devices for detecting asymptomatic malaria, where parasite levels are normally significantly lower than in symptomatic patients, is less well established. We evaluated the efficacy of a new combined Plasmodium falciparum-Plasmodim vivax immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria Pf/Pv) in a cross-sectional malaria survey of the village of Ban Kong Mong Tha, Kanchanaburi Provice, Thailand, from August to December 2000. A total of 1,976 bleeds were made from 559 individuals over the course of the study. Blinded microscopy of thick and thin blood films was used as the gold standard; all discordant and 10% of concordant results were cross-checked. Of 1,976 ICT Malaria Pf/Pv dipsticks tested, 98.3% (n = 1,943) performed as expected, as evidenced by the appearance of the control line. The ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test was both sensitive (100.0%) and specific (99.7 %) for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria with parasitemias of > or = 500 trophozoites/microL; however, only 15.9% (13/82) of infected individuals had parasitemia rates this high. When P. falciparum parasitemia rates were < 500/microL, the sensitivity of the diagnosis was only 23.3%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.2 and 97.2%, respectively. The ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test was specific, but not sensitive, for the diagnosis of vivax malaria with parasite rates of > or = 500 trophozoites/microl, with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 66.7%, 99.9%, 66.7%, and 99.9%, respectively. At parasite rates of < 500/microL, corresponding values were 0.0%, 99.9%, 0%, and 95.1%. Because of the relatively high cost of these assays, low parasite rates found in the majority of asymptomatic individuals, and low sensitivity of this assay with rates of < 500/microl, use of this assay as a tool for active case detection is of limited value in western Thailand."
CD008122,0,1373042,0,Antibody response to the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium vivax in naturally infected humans.,"The circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium vivax consists of a central repeat region flanked by highly conserved non-repeat regions. Serum samples from 33 individuals with naturally acquired infections of P. vivax were tested for antibodies to four antigens representing the vivax CS protein. Three recombinant proteins containing different overlapping sequences in the non-repeat regions and either the entire central repeat region (vivax-1 and vivax-2) or two of the repeat sequences (vivax-3) were used as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antibodies to two other proteins, one (NS1(81)V20) containing the entire predominant repeat region (GDRAA/DGQPA) and the other (Pvk247) containing the variant repeat sequence (ANGAGNQPG) that was recently reported from Thailand were also measured by ELISA. Immunoglobulin G antibodies to the antigen representing the predominant repeat were present in 15% of the patients on the first day of treatment (day 0) and in 24% of the patients two weeks later (post-treatment). Six and 12% of the patients had IgG antibodies to the antigen containing the variant repeat on day 0 and post-treatment, respectively. A larger proportion of the sera had antibodies to the three antigens containing the non-repeat sequences; on the first day of treatment and two weeks later, 79 and 97% of the patients, respectively, had antibodies to vivax-1, vivax-2, and vivax-3. In this sample of Peruvians naturally infected with P. vivax, the most prevalent antibody responses were targeted to epitopes in the non-repeat region of the CS protein rather than to epitopes in the repeat region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008122,0,7943571,0,Humoral immune responses to Plasmodium falciparum antigens in children and adults living in a hypoendemic area of Punjab (Pakistan).,"We have investigated the prevalence and the levels of antibodies reactive with repeat sequences in Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood-stage Pf155/ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA), Pf332 antigen, and the circumsporozoite (CS) protein in 532 children and adults residing in a hypoendemic area in the Punjab (Pakistan). We show here that the levels of antibodies reactive with synthetic peptides corresponding to repeat sequences in these antigens increased gradually with age. However, the prevalence and levels of antibodies reactive with the peptides were quite low as compared with the high prevalence of such antibodies in donors from areas holoendemic and hyperendemic for malaria. The levels of Ag332 (2-12)2-reactive antibodies in individual sera as well as in the study population as a whole correlated well with the levels of antibodies to the Pf155/RESA peptide (EENV)6. However, there was no correlation between anti-(EENV)6 and anti-Ag332 (2-12)2 antibody levels and malaria parasitemia. There was a significant negative correlation between anti-(NANP)6-reactive antibodies and the parasite rate, suggesting that a heavy load of blood-stage parasites may be one factor that exerts an immunosuppressive effect on the antibody response to the sporozoites."
CD008122,0,17116669,0,"In vitro antimalarial activity of azithromycin, artesunate, and quinine in combination and correlation with clinical outcome.","Azithromycin when used in combination with faster-acting antimalarials has proven efficacious in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria in phase 2 clinical trials. The aim of this study was to establish optimal combination ratios for azithromycin in combination with either dihydroartemisinin or quinine, to determine the clinical correlates of in vitro drug sensitivity for these compounds, and to assess the cross-sensitivity patterns. Seventy-three fresh P. falciparum isolates originating from patients from the western border regions of Thailand were successfully tested for their drug susceptibility in a histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) assay. With overall mean fractional inhibitory concentrations of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.77 to 1.08) and 0.78 (95% CI=0.72 to 0.98), the interactions between azithromycin and dihydroartemisinin, as well as quinine, were classified as additive, with a tendency toward synergism. The strongest tendency toward synergy was seen with a combination ratio of 1:547 for the combination with dihydroartemisinin and 1:44 with quinine. The geometric mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of azithromycin was 2,570.3 (95% CI=2,175.58 to 3,036.58) ng/ml. The IC50s for mefloquine, quinine, and chloroquine were 11.42, 64.4, and 54.4 ng/ml, respectively, suggesting a relatively high level of background resistance in this patient population. Distinct correlations (R=0.53; P=0.001) between quinine in vitro results and parasite clearance may indicate a compromised sensitivity to this drug. The correlation with dihydroartemisinin data was weaker (R=0.34; P=0.038), and no such correlation was observed for azithromycin. Our in vitro data confirm that azithromycin in combination with artemisinin derivatives or quinine exerts additive to synergistic interactions, shows no cross-sensitivity with traditional antimalarials, and has substantial antimalarial activity on its own."
CD008122,0,15255647,0,Possible role of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor receptor (GM-CSF R) in malaria.,"Malaria has been reportedly increasing in incidence on the globe. Evidence from clinical studies supports a role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. Given the stimulatory effect of the ligand GM-CSF on the synthesis and release of the pyrogenic cytokine TNF alpha, the present study has been undertaken to investigate a possible role of GMCSF receptor in the pathogenesis of both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria. An enzyme immunoassay developed by us at our laboratory for the quantitation of GM-CSF receptor has been used. No changes in the concentration of the receptor have been indicated either at the time of diagnosis or after treatment. In addition, an intercomparison of the receptor concentration between the P. vivax and P. falciparum groups does not show any significant difference. The results suggest that GM-CSF receptor has no significant role in the pathogenesis of either type of malaria."
CD008122,0,8337730,0,Towards optimal regimens of parenteral quinine for young African children with cerebral malaria: the importance of unbound quinine concentration.,"Young African children with severe malaria are given quinine using a regimen designed for Thai adults. We measured quinine in the blood, plasma and plasma water of young children in Kenya after rapid intravenous and intramuscular dosing, and calculated the therapeutic range of unbound quinine. The peak plasma quinine concentration after rapid intravenous dosing was 12.3 +/- 3.7 mg/L (mean +/- SD), 43% higher than in adults given the same regimen previously; this was due to a smaller apparent volume of distribution in the children. The therapeutic range of unbound quinine was calculated as 0.2-2.0 mg/L. Simulations of unbound quinine were made for the standard quinine regimen: unbound drug concentrations rose above the therapeutic range after each dose. The possible risks of quinine-induced visual impairment are discussed. Alternative, lower dose regimens for young African children with severe malaria are described."

In 1986, at Mama Yemo Hospital, Kinshasa, Zaire, the incidence of malaria was determined in a cohort of 59 patients who had recently acquired HIV-I infection through blood transfusion and in a cohort of 83 HIV-I seronegative controls who were recipients of HIV-I seronegative blood. All cohort patients were asked to visit the study physician whenever they developed fever. On each of these occasions thick film was examined for the presence of malarial parasites. HIV-I seropositive patients presented more often with episodes of fever per person month observation than HIV-I seronegative patients (P = 0.003). The total number of positive thick films per person months observation was significantly higher among HIV-I seropositive patients than among the HIV-I seronegative ones, but percentages of positive thick films per episode of fever were the same in both groups (46%). During a 5 month period, cohort patients presenting with a moderate attack of malaria were treated with oral quinine 20 mg/kg daily in two doses for 5 days. Twenty-three (92%) of 25 HIV-I seropositive patients and 28 (82%) of 34 HIV-I seronegative patients had a negative film 7 days after starting treatment. This study suggests that there seems to be no direct interaction of major clinical importance between HIV infection and malaria."

To evaluate vaccine safety, clinical observations were made 30 min and 48 h after each immunization. There were no adverse reactions in 95.7% of cases. In the 4.3% of cases with adverse reactions, local induration and erythema were the most frequent. In a randomly selected group of vaccinees, anti-SPf66 antibody titers were measured after the third dose: 93% of the vaccinees raised antibodies to SPf66. Among these, 55% had titers greater than 1:1600. These results demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of the SPf66 vaccine in a large field trial."
CD008122,0,10466961,0,Longevity of naturally acquired antibody responses to the N- and C-terminal regions of Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1.,"In an earlier study, we found that individuals with patent infection had significantly higher IgG antibody titers to the 19-kD C-terminal region of Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (PvMSP1) than individuals treated for malaria 1-4 months earlier. These results suggested that the antibody levels decreased rapidly following treatment. The present study was designed to determine the persistence of antibody response to the N- and C-terminal regions of PvMSP1 after infection with P. vivax in individuals from the city of Bélem in northern Brazil. Our results demonstrated that the vast majority of individuals had a significant decrease in antibody titers to the C-terminal region of PvMSP1 in a period of two months following treatment. Among responders to the C-terminal region, 44.4% became serologically negative and 44.4% had their antibody titers reduced by an average of 13-fold. Only 11.2% of the individuals had their antibody titers maintained or slightly increased during that period. A decrease in the antibody response to the recombinant protein representing the N-terminal region of PvMSP1 was also noted; however, it was not as dramatic. The rapid decrease in the antibody levels to the C-terminal region of PvMSP1 might contribute to the high risk of reinfection in these individuals."

They received preventive medical treatment before departure and were kept under constant surveillance. Because the group was multiethnic and divided into four separate work teams, communication was a major problem. Regular prevention and continuous care allowed control of the fever episodes which occurred in one half of the group presumably from malaria. Since laboratory tests could not be performed, diagnosis and treatment were undertaken presumptively. In this regard the ParaSight-F test would have been highly useful. The second most common manifestations in this susceptible population in an unfamiliar and hostile environment were psychiatric in nature. This finding underscores the need for better screening before departure. The multipurpose first aid kit was adequate. This experience could be helpful to physicians responsible for managing groups traveling in areas where sanitary conditions are poor."

In humans, malaria DNA vaccines elicit CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and IFNgamma responses as measured by short-term (ex vivo) ELISPOT assays, and recombinant proteins elicit antibodies and excellent T cell responses, but no CD8(+) CTL or CD8(+) IFNgamma-producing cells as measured by ex vivo ELISPOT. Priming with DNA and boosting with recombinant pox virus elicits much better T cell responses than DNA alone, but not antibody responses. In an attempt to elicit antibodies and enhanced T cell responses, we administered RTS,S/AS02A, a partially protective Plasmodium falciparum recombinant circumsporozoite protein (CSP) vaccine in adjuvant, to volunteers previously immunized with a P. falciparum CSP DNA vaccine (VCL-2510) and to naïve volunteers. This vaccine regimen was well tolerated and safe. The volunteers who received RTS,S/AS02A alone had, as expected, antibody and CD4(+) T cell responses, but no CD8(+) T cell responses. Volunteers who received PfCSP DNA followed by RTS,S/AS02A had antibody and CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses (Wang et al., submitted). Sequential immunization with DNA and recombinant protein, also called heterologous prime-boost, led to enhanced immune responses as compared to DNA or recombinant protein alone, suggesting that it might provide enhanced protective immunity."

Cellular immune responses to malaria antigens, measured by lymphoproliferative responses and interferon production, were higher in children who had received prophylaxis than in controls, although the anti-malarial antibody levels were lower. During a one-year period after termination of prophylaxis, there was no increase in the frequency of clinical episodes of malaria in the children who had received Maloprim. These results suggest that chemoprophylaxis for 3 years may lower malaria antibody levels, but does not interfere with the development of protective immunity, perhaps by enhancing cell-mediated immune responses to malaria in protected children."

The particle-malaria antigen conjugate (PAgC), particle-monoclonal IgG antibody to Plasmodium falciparum heat shock protein 70 conjugate (PmAbC), and particle-polyclonal IgG antibody to P. falciparum malaria conjugate (PpAbC) were prepared via adsorption process. The higher affinity of the malaria antigen adsorption onto particles was observed compared to that of the antibodies. Immunoagglutination of sensitive latex particles was monitored by measuring the change in turbidity, and the aggregate's formation was clearly observed under optical microscope. The efficacy in malaria diagnosis of the conjugated particles evaluated at an outpatient malaria clinic (Mae Sod, Thailand) indicated a success detection of antibody or antigen. Sensitivity of PAgC, PmAbC, and PpAbC for P. falciparum was 84%, 90%, and 90%, respectively, while specificity for malaria disease was 70% for PAgC and 80% for PmAbC and PpAbC.

As documented in the current issue of Clinical Cytometry, complex flow cytometric analyses used in affluent countries for CD4+ T cell counting in HIV/AIDS have been simplified, introduced, and quality assessed in resource-restricted countries of Africa and the Caribbean, where simple gating protocols such as panleucogating now provide accurate and precise CD4+ T cell counts on a large scale. CD4/CD8 ratios in infants may replace more expensive molecular tests for HIV infection; simplified flow cytometry is also compatible with HIV viral load-associated lymphocyte activation tests and with antigen-specific cellular immune response assays that rapidly diagnose active TB in both HIV-negative and HIV-TB co-infected individuals. In addition, it is becoming evident that smaller, much less expensive fluorescence imaging cytometers can be used for CD4 counting, immunophenotyping, and hematology and for other applications such as diagnosis and drug-susceptibility testing of TB and diagnosis of malaria. With the gradual, organized expansion of the much-needed diagnostic networks in the underprivileged countries, the most cost-effective apparatus may be one capable of performing tests for all the three diseases mentioned. The most sustainable systems will be those that can be assembled and maintained, to the greatest extent possible, in the countries where they will be used."
CD008122,0,9357523,0,Antimalarial activity of molecules interfering with Plasmodium falciparum phospholipid metabolism. Structure-activity relationship analysis.,"A series of 80 compounds, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium and bisammonium salts, most of them synthesized as potential choline or ethanolamine analogs, were tested against the in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum, the human malaria parasite. They were active over the 10(-3)-10(-8) M concentration range. A structure-activity relationship study was carried out using autocorrelation vectors as structural descriptors, and multidimensional analysis. Principal component analysis, ascending hierarchical classification, and stepwise discriminant analysis showed that both the size and shape of the molecule were essential for antimalarial potency, making the lipophilicity and electronegativity distribution in the molecular space essential. Using the autocorrelogram describing the molecular shape and the electronegativity distribution on the molecular graph, 98% of the molecules were correctly classified either as poorly active or active with only three explanatory variables. The most active compounds were quaternary ammoniums salts whose nitrogen atom had only one long lipophilic chain of 11 or 12 methylene groups (E5, E6, E10, E13, E20, E21, E22, E23, F4, F8), or the bisammoniums whose polar heads were linked by linear alkyl chains of 10 to 12 carbon atoms (G4, G23). The hydroxyethyl group of choline was not very beneficial, whereas the charge and substitutions of nitrogen (aimed at increasing lipophilicity) were essential for optimal interactions. A crude topographic model of the ligand (choline) binding site was thus drawn up."

CD008122,0,3531227,0,Evaluation of dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and comparison with microplate enzyme immunoassay.,"A dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot ELISA) was evaluated and compared with a standard microplate ELISA (immunoglobulin G [IgG] ELISA) for the serological diagnosis of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. The two assays were used to test 113 serum specimens from the following groups: normal individuals and patients with deep mycoses, toxoplasmosis, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease, malaria, and schistosomiasis. Both tests exhibited cross-reactivity when testing specimens from cases of visceral leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease. The dot ELISA proved to be economical with respect to use of reagents and was easy to perform. Interpretation could easily be made by visual inspection of reaction endpoints in the nitrocellulose disks, obviating the need for spectrophotometric readings. There were no significant differences in sensitivity between the dot ELISA and the IgG ELISA at a cutoff level either of 20 or 40. However, its most remarkable feature was the high specificity compared with that of the IgG ELISA. Because of its ease of performance and high sensitivity and specificity, the dot ELISA should be an excellent test to be executed in the field during seroepidemiological surveys."
CD008122,0,14686112,0,Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in malaria.,"Various autoantibodies like anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-histone antibodies (AHA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-myeloperoxidase (anti-MPO), anti-proteinase3 (anti-PR3) and anti-lactoferrin (anti-LF) antibodies were studied in 173 acute hospitalised patients suffering from malaria of which 160 patients had P. falciparum and remaining 13 had P. vivax infection. Standard methods like indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) microscopy along with Confocal microscopy and ELISA were used for identifying and quantifying the autoantibodies and IIF patterns on PMN and HL-60 cells were studied for ANCA classification. Also HEp-2 cells were used for ANA detection, while estimation of anti-dsDNA, AHA, anti-MPO, anti-PR3 and anti-LF were tested using ELISA. Sera from malaria patients showed prominent immunofluorescence staining patterns where 23.8% cases had ANA in P. falciparum group as compared to 15.4% in P. vivax group and ANCA was found to be present in 20% in P. falciparum and 15.4% in P. vivax group. An interesting observation was that, of the total ANCA positives, 59% had p-ANCA, 5.9% had c-ANCA and 44.1% of the cases showed the 'atypical' or X-ANCA pattern. When p-ANCA positivity was compared with c-ANCA positivity among these patients, a good statistical correlation was noted with OR = 16, chi 2 = 16.43, EF = 0.46 and p-value = 5.037E 0.5. ELISA showed 31.2% anti-MPO and 6.2% anti-PR3 in P. falciparum cases while the two ANCA positive cases in P. vivax had anti-MPO. Anti-LF was found to be present in 40.6% cases. Neither the P. falciparum nor P. vivax contained autoantibodies with specificities similar to the characteristic lupus autoantibodies such as double stranded DNA (dsDNA). ANCA positivity develops in some types of malarial infection also with the presence of various autoantibodies which is important from a clinical point of view and should be carefully evaluated in those geographic areas where malaria is endemic. It also alerts us to the fact, whether in cases of repeated malarial infections in susceptible individuals, vasculitic disorders, which through ANCA pathways develop, could lead to renal and other complications."
CD008122,0,12080971,0,Diagnosis of malaria using thick bloodsmears: definition and evaluation of a faster protocol with improved readability.,"The value of some inexpensive modifications to the standard method of preparing thick bloodsmears, involving rapid drying, an isotonic fixative and a haemolysing solution containing saponin, was evaluated. The drying, haemolysing, fixing and staining steps, together called the fast-thick-smear method (FTS), can be completed in < 10 min. The FTS and a more classical thick-smear method (CTS) were both used on each of 1185 samples of venous blood samples from 1034 cases of suspected malaria (all international travellers returning to France). The results indicated that there was no statistically significant differences between the two methods in terms of their sensitivity, specificity or predictive values for parasite detection. However, estimates of the intensities of the Plasmodium falciparum infections observed, based on counts of trophozoites against 200 leucocytes, were markedly higher (37.8% higher overall) with the FTS than with the CTS (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the concordance between results obtained by inexperienced and experienced microscopists was excellent when the FTS was used, with a kappa value of 0.96 (95% confidence interval = 0.93-0.98)."
CD008122,0,14686117,0,Study of malaria in a village of lower Myanmar.,"Malaria endemicity in lower Myanmar has been studied to identify the causes for the prevalence of malaria in Yeasitkan village of lower Myanmar. Vector mosquitoes were collected by mosquito net in cattlesheds and in human dwellings (indoor and outdoor) by biting and catching procedure for the identification of species, insecticide susceptibility test and sporozoites detection. Larvae of mosquitoes were also collected in and around the village for vector identification and for breeding sources. Malaria infection in humans was examined by blood examination and blood antibody detection by ELISA method. Results showed that malaria infection was 43.2% in children under 10 years of age and An. dirus and An. minimus were found as main vectors. Total parasite positive rate was found to be 41.28% and in this 78.87% were P. falciparum infections and remaining 18.31% were of P. vivax. Spleen positive rate has been found very high in children between 2 and 9 years (52.94%). Study indicates that villages near to dam areas are more prone to malaria infection."
CD008122,0,16235185,0,Amplification of Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 in isolates from Gabon.,"The study of molecular markers of drug resistance is particularly important in surveillance studies of drugs, such as mefloquine, that still retain efficacy in sub-Saharan Africa yet have encountered resistance elsewhere. In a recent study in Thailand, we identified amplification of the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1) as being the most important predictor of in vitro drug resistance and in vivo failure of mefloquine monotherapy. Here we report amplification of pfmdr1 in >5% of patient samples from Lambarene, Gabon, collected in 1995. None of the samples collected 7 years later showed pfmdr1 amplification, suggesting that parasites with increased numbers of pfmdr1 copies have not substantially spread through the population. Nevertheless, the detection of multicopy pfmdr1 in African parasites suggests a high potential for rapid selection for resistance, implying that mefloquine use in Africa should be considered only as part of combination therapy."
CD008122,0,3549031,0,Defined Plasmodium falciparum antigens in malaria serology.,"The study evaluates three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) of malaria antigens suitable for use in large-scale epidemiological studies. Results obtained using sera from 567 persons from the Gambia indicated that the micro-ELISA method using parasitized red blood cell extract did not reliably quantitate antimalarial antibodies, especially in young children. In contrast, two micro-ELISA methods that employed purified, defined antigens (a polypeptide of M(r) = 41 000 present in rhoptries, and a 31-1 fusion polypeptide corresponding to a merozoite surface antigen) permitted the precise determination of antimalarial antibodies in both adults and children. Problems and advantages associated with the use of the M(r) = 41 000 and 31-1 antigens for the determination of antimalarial antibodies are discussed."
CD008122,0,17005815,0,Assessment of the drug susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates from africa by using a Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase immunodetection assay and an inhibitory maximum effect model for precise measurement of the 50-percent inhibitory concentration.,"The extension of drug resistance among malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Africa necessitates implementation of new combined therapeutic strategies. Drug susceptibility phenotyping requires precise measurements. Until recently, schizont maturation and isotopic in vitro assays were the only methods available, but their use was limited by technical constraints. This explains the revived interest in the development of replacement methods, such as the Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) immunodetection assay. We evaluated a commercially controlled pLDH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; the ELISA-Malaria antigen test; DiaMed AG, Cressier s/Morat, Switzerland) to assess drug susceptibility in a standard in vitro assay using fairly basic laboratory equipment to study the in vitro resistance of malaria parasites to major antimalarials. Five Plasmodium falciparum clones and 121 clinical African isolates collected during 2003 and 2004 were studied by the pLDH ELISA and the [8-(3)H]hypoxanthine isotopic assay as a reference with four antimalarials. Nonlinear regression with a maximum effect model was used to estimate the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) and its confidence intervals. The two methods were observed to have similar reproducibilities, but the pLDH ELISA demonstrated a higher sensitivity. The high correlation (r = 0.98) and the high phenotypic agreement (kappa = 0.88) between the two methods allowed comparison by determination of the IC(50)s. Recently collected Plasmodium falciparum African isolates were tested by pLDH ELISA and showed drug resistance or decreased susceptibilities of 62% to chloroquine and 11.5% to the active metabolite of amodiaquine. No decreased susceptibility to lumefantrine or the active metabolite of artemisinin was detected. The availability of this simple and highly sensitive pLDH immunodetection assay will provide an easier method for drug susceptibility testing of malaria parasites."

CD008122,0,9594675,0,Comparison of a rapid dipstick test and thick blood films for detecting parasites of plasmodium falciparum used under typical conditions at a semi-rural hospital in Cote d'Ivoire.,"This prospective study compares a rapid dipstick test (ParaSight-F) with thick blood films for the detection of parasites of P falciparum, under 'typical' conditions and constraints to be found in a semi-rural hospital in a tropical developing country in Africa. Eighty-two samples were tested using the two techniques and found to concur in 95.1% of cases. However, in four of the samples the results differed. The thick blood films of 60 samples were later re-read by a local reference laboratory. Of these 98.3% were in agreement with the reading performed at the hospital. Only one of the 60 slides differed. The rapid dipstick test proved to be both easy to use and free from many of the usual constraints such as a need for formally trained or experienced laboratory staff, laboratory equipment, and reliable water and electricity supplies. In an holoendemic area for P falciparum transmission, it would appear to be eminently suitable, in technical terms and ease of handling as well as on the basis of rapid results, for wider distribution within this region. Its main drawback remains financial."

We report the cases of three patients who acquired vivax malaria in Guyana, South America, and for whom standard chloroquine therapy (25 mg/kg) failed despite therapeutic blood levels. The optimal treatment of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax malaria is unknown, but recent studies suggest that a combination of chloroquine (25 mg/kg) and high-dose primaquine (2.5 mg/kg over 48 hours) is effective therapy. Two of our patients had recurrences of P. vivax malaria 6-8 weeks after receiving directly observed therapy with this combination. These cases confirm the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax in Guyana and emphasize the need for better treatment regimens for chloroquine-resistant and primaquine-resistant P. vivax malaria."

Four hundred and four (7.5%) specimens reacted with the ELISA anti-human alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The human blood index in nine species of Anopheles varied from 3.6 to 23.7%. The results of this field application of the ELISA indicated that the technique is practical, reproducible and generally a suitable serological test for determination of human blood index of the anopheline mosquitoes."

Eight (62%) volunteers had a greater than or equal to 4-fold increase of antibody titer against sporozoites in immunofluorescence assay, all 13 seroconverted in IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against [NANP]50 antigen, and in 6 (46%) a lymphocyte proliferation index greater than or equal to 3 against 5.1 antigen was observed. Seven volunteers were challenged with mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum. All developed detectable parasitemia after 7 to 12 days and all received drug therapy within 24 hours. One volunteer with a cellular response to 5.1 had two negative in vitro parasite cultures before treatment, despite overt parasitemia.

CD008122,0,1537547,0,Detection of Plasmodium falciparum DNA in a microtitration plate-based hybridization test.,"A rapid DNA-test, depending on the affinity based hybrid collection principle, was developed for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum DNA from clinical specimens. In this method, hybridization takes place in solution and the hybrids are collected onto a solid phase for measurement. Two probes are used, one labelled with an affinity tag (biotin) and the other with a detectable label (32P). In the present test a single oligonucleotide complementary to a 21-base pair sequence which is highly repeated in the parasite genome served both as capture and detector probe. The test is a 2-h hybridization performed in streptavidin coated microtitration plate wells, onto which the labelled hybrids simultaneously bind. The sensitivity of the assay with a crude erythrocyte lysate specimen was 1.6 x 10(9) repeat units corresponding to about 160 parasites in one microliter blood. The results allowed quantification of the repeat sequences and thus estimation of the degree of parasitemia in clinical specimens."

Increased incidences of antibodies to assorted arboviruses, including chikungunya, have been found in eBL sera compared to controls. An increased incidence and space-time case-clusters of eBL occurred during a chikungunya fever epidemic which were confirmed by serology and clinical observation. The present study, conducted in 1987-89, involved 108 eBL patients, and 97 local and 111 hospital controls. We examined, as hospital controls, patients with afebrile, non-malignant conditions admitted to Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi, during the eBL patients' first admission there. Analyses were for hospital controls and eBL patients at the end of their first admission and for local controls and eBL patients at the beginning of their third admission, about 8 weeks after the day of first admission, because of the local controls' temporal bias. Patients in case-clusters were among those seropositive for chikungunya virus, with a history compatible with arbovirus infection preceding the lymphoma, suggesting involvement of chikungunya virus in the case-clusters and a possible association between recent infection with this virus and development of the lymphoma. eBL patients were significantly more likely to be seropositive for chikungunya virus antibody (68x5%) than either hospital controls (46.8%) or local controls (50x5%) (P = 0x002 and 0x009, respectively), raising the possibility of an association between infection with an arbovirus and developing eBL in children already primed by holoendemic malaria and Epstein-Barr virus infection."
CD008122,0,1615297,0,Cerebral malaria.,"Cerebral malaria is the most important manifestation of severe Plasmodium falciparum infection. The clinical picture in South East Asian adults differs from that in African children. The children are more likely to have abnormal brain stem reflexes, signs suggestive of cerebral herniation, and raised CSF opening pressure, and to suffer persistent neurological sequelae. The mortality remains high at about 20%. The diagnosis must be considered in all patients with fever and impaired consciousness who may have been exposed to the infection. The pathophysiology of cerebral malaria may involve mechanical obstruction of the cerebral circulation by parasitized erythrocytes which have adhered to the vascular endothelium. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor may also contribute. The most important element of treatment is early, optimal chemotherapy with quinine, but artemisinine derivatives may prove even more effective."

Thus, non-invasive, cost-effective malaria tests that minimize the need for blood collection are needed. Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein II (PfHRP II) levels in plasma and saliva were compared in malaria-positive and -negative patients in Ghana. Plasma and saliva obtained from 30 thick-film positive and 10 negative children were evaluated for PfHRP II by ELISA. Among the 30 children with positive blood smear, 16 (53%) were PfHRP II positive in plasma and 13 (43%) had PfHRP II positive saliva. The sensitivity of PfHRP II detection was 53% for plasma and 43% for saliva. The specificity was 100% with no false positive for both plasma and saliva when compared with blood smear. Thus, rapid detection of PfHRP II antigen in saliva may be a useful non-invasive and cost-effective malaria diagnostic technique."
CD008122,0,3548451,0,The feasibility of a Dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dot-ELISA) for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum antigens and antibodies.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of malarial antibodies and antigens was developed. Plasmodium falciparum antigen preparation, obtained from sonicated cultures of the parasite at a parasitemia of 10%-15%, was applied to cellulose filter discs in volumes of 0.1 microliter in 96-well microtiter plates. Antibodies were detected by successive incubations with: bovine serum albumin for blocking, tested serum at different dilutions, peroxidase-conjugated antihuman IgG, and the precipitable substrate 4-chloro-1-naphtol. Positive reactions appeared as blue dots on a white background which are easily read by eye. Pools of sera from patients with recent disease or from individuals with a history of malaria, contained antibodies detectable up to a dilution of 1:64,000. Negative results were obtained when normal RBC were used for dotting the filters. Normal sera showed no reaction at any antigen concentration. P. falciparum antigens were detected by their ability to inhibit the binding of antibody to the filters. RBC infected with P. falciparum in vitro can be detected at a level of 0.001% parasitemia. This report presents the feasibility of an assay for detecting malarial antibodies and antigens in blood samples which is easily applicable to field conditions."

Results were analyzed using the Student's t-test for identification of positive serum samples (t greater than or equal to 2.92, P less than or equal to 0.05) and for calculation of the mean difference in absorbance values (delta ABS) obtained between the P. falciparum wells and the control wells. Cross-evaluation with the IFA test for P. falciparum antibodies gave 89.6% concording positive or negative results. Among discrepant sera 8.35% were ELISA+/IFA- and 2.05% ELISA-/IFA+. In addition, delta ABS values in ELISA were highly correlated to titers obtained in immunofluorescence (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001). The results confirm the high degree of species-specificity of the ELISA using P. falciparum crude antigen. The necessity of the simultaneous use of red blood cell control antigen with a crude plasmodial antigen is demonstrated by comparing the presented results with those obtained on the P. falciparum antigen only."
CD008122,0,7796750,0,Bacteraemia in patients presenting with fever.,"In three studies, in Ghana and Kenya, blood from 639 patients admitted with fever was cultured. Standard treatments were antimalarials (54-100%) and antibiotics (39-90%). According to the criteria in use, however, only 10-31% had malaria alone; of those who received antibiotics, 66% were diagnosed with malaria, gastrointestinal infections, post-operative recuperations, circulatory problems, central nervous system disorders or FUO, and did not need antibiotics at the first encounter. For those with wounds and abscesses (8%), generalised antibiotic treatment can also be questioned. Bacteraemia was found in 71 (11.3%) patients; in the HIV patients, however, 5 (23%) of 22 had bacteraemia. This is a minimum incidence, since culture techniques were not optimal for the isolation of fastidious microorganisms. The most prevalent organisms isolated were Salmonella, Klebsiella/Enterobacter and S. aureus. Resistance (intrinsic and extrinsic) in the Gram- bacteria was high: 31-100% were resistant to amoxycillin, 0-80% to cotrimoxazole, 15-95% to chloramphenicol and 9-15% to gentamicin. The need for cultures and sensitivity tests for patients with prolonged or undiagnosed fever is stressed. Specific treatment should be given only when infections, whether malarial or bacterial, have been positively diagnosed."

CD008122,0,3000453,0,Choline kinase activity in Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes: characterization and utilization as a parasite-specific marker in malarial fractionation studies.,"Choline kinase (EC 2.7.1.32) was investigated in plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Disrupted infected erythrocytes had a choline kinase activity of 1.9 +/- 0.2 nmol phosphorylcholine/10(7) infected cells per h, whereas the activity in normal uninfected erythrocytes was less than 6 pmol/10(7) cells per h. A broad alkaline optimal pH (7.9-9.2) was observed. The Km values for choline and ATP were 79 +/- 20 microM, and 1.3 +/- 0.3 mM, respectively. ATP concentrations higher than 12 mM inhibited choline kinase. Maximal activity was registered with a Mg2+ concentration of 10 mM, whereas its replacement by Mn2+, or other divalent cations, involved a decrease in choline kinase activity of at least 75%. Inhibition by products of the reaction, such as phosphorylcholine and ADP was investigated. In plasmodium knowlesi-infected erythrocytes, choline kinase had similar properties, but with a much higher specific activity of 16.4 +/- 2.1 nmol/10(7) infected cells per h. Subcellular fractionation of P. knowlesi-infected erythrocyte suspensions revealed that choline kinase was located exclusively in the cytosol of the parasite. We show that this enzyme is a useful index of parasite cytosolic content leakage, when infected erythrocytes are fractionated by saponin lysis or nitrogen decompression."

CD008122,0,6389853,0,The falklands: rate of British psychiatric combat casualties compared to recent American wars.,"This paper examines factors leading to the low rate of combat psychiatric casualties in the British recapture of the Falklands compared to the American experience in North Africa, Italy, Europe and South Pacific theatres during World War II, the Korean Conflict and Vietnam. The factors compared are those thought to affect rates seen in these past wars. The factors highlighted are psychiatric screening of evacuees, presence of psychiatric personnel in line units, intensity of combat and use of elite units. Factors also mentioned are presence of possible occult psychiatric casualties such as frostbite and malaria, amount of indirect fire and the offensive or defensive nature of the combat. A unique aspect of the Falklands War examined is the exclusive use of hospital ships to treat psychiatric casualties and the impact of Geneva Convention rules regarding hospital ships on the classic treatment principles of proximity and expectancy. The types and numbers of various diagnoses are also presented. The British Campaign in the Falklands produced a remarkably low rate of psychiatric casualties. When viewed in light of American experience in recent wars, this low rate represents a concentration of optimal factors leading to healthy function in combat. The results of this war should not be used to predict a similar outcome in future combat as this particular constellation of factors may not recur."

CD008122,0,18809668,0,"An in vivo and in vitro model of Plasmodium falciparum rosetting and autoagglutination mediated by varO, a group A var gene encoding a frequent serotype.","In the Saimiri sciureus monkey, erythrocytes infected with the varO antigenic variant of the Plasmodium falciparum Palo Alto 89F5 clone bind uninfected red blood cells (rosetting), form autoagglutinates, and have a high multiplication rate, three phenotypic characteristics that are associated with severe malaria in human patients. We report here that varO parasites express a var gene having the characteristics of group A var genes, and we show that the varO Duffy binding-like 1alpha(1) (DBL1alpha(1)) domain is implicated in the rosetting of both S. sciureus and human erythrocytes. The soluble varO N-terminal sequence (NTS)-DBL1alpha(1) recombinant domain, produced in a baculovirus-insect cell system, induced high titers of antibodies that reacted with varO-infected red blood cells and disrupted varO rosettes. varO parasites were culture adapted in vitro using human erythrocytes. They formed rosettes and autoagglutinates, and they had the same surface serotype and expressed the same varO gene as the monkey-propagated parasites. To develop an in vitro model with highly homogeneous varO parasites, rosette purification was combined with positive selection by panning with a varO NTS-DBL1alpha(1)-specific mouse monoclonal antibody. The single-variant, clonal parasites were used to analyze seroprevalence for varO at the village level in a setting where malaria is holoendemic (Dielmo, Senegal). We found 93.6% (95% confidence interval, 89.7 to 96.4%) seroprevalence for varO surface-reacting antibodies and 86.7% (95% confidence interval, 82.8 to 91.6%) seroprevalence for the recombinant NTS-DBL1alpha(1) domain, and virtually all permanent residents had seroconverted by the age of 5 years. These data imply that the varO model is a relevant in vivo and in vitro model for rosetting and autoagglutination that can be used for rational development of vaccine candidates and therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing malaria pathology."

CD008122,0,18809666,0,Low prevalence of antibodies to preerythrocytic but not blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum antigens in an area of unstable malaria transmission compared to prevalence in an area of stable malaria transmission.,"In areas where levels of transmission of Plasmodium falciparum are high and stable, the age-related acquisition of high-level immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to preerythrocytic circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and liver-stage antigen 1 (LSA-1) has been associated with protection from clinical malaria. In contrast, age-related protection from malaria develops slowly or not at all in residents of epidemic-prone areas with unstable low levels of malaria transmission. We hypothesized that this suboptimal clinical and parasitological immunity may in part be due to reduced antibodies to CSP or LSA-1 and/or vaccine candidate blood-stage antigens. Frequencies and levels of IgG antibodies to CSP, LSA-1, thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP), apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1), erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA-175), and merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) were compared in 243 Kenyans living in a highland area of unstable transmission and 210 residents of a nearby lowland area of stable transmission. Levels of antibodies to CSP, LSA-1, TRAP, and AMA-1 in the oldest age group (>40 years) in the unstable transmission area were lower than or similar to those of children 2 to 6 years old in the stable transmission area. Only 3.3% of individuals in the unstable transmission area had high levels of IgG (>2 arbitrary units) to both CSP and LSA-1, compared to 43.3% of individuals in the stable transmission area. In contrast, antibody levels to and frequencies of MSP-1 and EBA-175 were similar in adults in areas of stable and unstable malaria transmission. Suboptimal immunity to malaria in areas of unstable malaria transmission may relate in part to infrequent high-level antibodies to preerythrocytic antigens and AMA-1."

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance was found in 33 patients. The history of use of chemoprophylaxis was recorded in 357 patients: 168 (49%) took adequate, 103 inadequate and 86 no chemoprophylaxis. In 65 of the 168 patients with a history of good compliance, prophylactic serum concentrations could be measured; in 56 (86%) patients the history was confirmed by the chloroquine level. All but one of them were infected with a resistant P. falciparum strain. Of the 66 semi-immune patients, 60 were infected in their homeland; in 5 (8%) chloroquine resistance was found. Only 1 of the 60 patients had used adequate chemoprophylaxis and proved to be infected with a resistant P. falciparum strain. During the study the spread of drug resistance from East Africa to other parts of Africa could be observed. Monitoring for drug-resistant falciparum malaria in travellers returning from malaria-endemic areas is a helpful tool in predicting the evolution of drug resistance in that area.

Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant species comprising more than 80% of the cases. As a whole, the distribution of malaria was similar among males and females. Children below 15 years accounted for a large percentage of the cases. The sensitivity of the optimal dipstick was 62.36 and the specificity was 61.7. Microscopy was taken as the gold standard. Anopheles dirus was found to be the main vector and the vectorial capacity correlated well with the cases."

CD008122,0,8129478,0,"Rapid, early and specific diagnosis of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial diseases in Burundi.","The potential usefulness of ELISA based serological tests to assist in rapid, early and specific diagnosis of tuberculosis was investigated. The materials were selected, based on published data and on our preliminary findings. Initially screening tests were performed using crude antigens such as Purified Protein Derivate (PPD) and a BCG-filtrate. Unfortunately, the results with these antigens were not promising. The specificity of both antigens using sera from 94 healthy controls was 64%. As a consequence of these findings, the crude antigens were excluded from further tests, and the study was continued with purified antigens. The work focused on 2 purified proteins: Antigen 60 (A60), a lipopolysaccharide-protein complex, and P32, a stress protein produced in zinc deprived cultures, identified as Antigen 85 A in the BCG reference system, both isolated from Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The commercial A60 based ELISA and our own P32 based ELISA were used to test a total of 300 sera from HIV positive, negative and unscreened individuals, mainly originating from Burundi. These sera were collected from clinical established cases of pulmonary TB, extrapulmonary TB, and patients with non-tuberculous tropical diseases such as salmonellosis, trypanosomiasis, malaria, etc. and healthy individuals. The A60 based ELISA had a sensitivity of 76.8% for the proven cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis and 61.9% for the extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases. No difference was shown between HIV positive and HIV negative patients. Specificity reached 95.2% for healthy individuals, but dropped to 68.1% when persons with active non-tuberculous tropical diseases were included. Eighty-six percent of the pulmonary cases and 87.7% of the extrapulmonary cases were detected by the ELISA-P32. These findings suggest that this test might be useful as a confirmatory test for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Again no difference was noticed between HIV negative and positive patients. The main contraindication for the use of the ELISA-P32 for the diagnosis of tuberculosis is its low specificity: 70.2% with sera from healthy controls and 22.2% for hospitalised patients and persons with non-tuberculous tropical diseases. In a small recent prospective study 4 out of 10 HIV+ persons with no evidence for TB yielded a positive result for the ELISA-P32. Two of them developed pulmonary tuberculosis within 6 months, whereas 2 P32-positives and 6 P32-negatives remained up to now without any manifestations of tuberculosis. The difference was not significant, but the number of cases was limited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD008122,0,19284307,0,Anti-MSP1 block 2 antibodies are effective at parasite killing in an allele-specific manner by monocyte-mediated antibody-dependent cellular inhibition.,"We investigated whether anti-merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1) block 2 antibodies mediate the monocyte-dependent antibody-mediated cellular inhibition (ADCI) of Plasmodium falciparum. This study was performed because soluble molecules have been shown to trigger ADCI and because MSP1 block 2 is released following processing and is the target of cytophilic IgG3 responses in exposed populations. We assessed human anti-MSP1 block 2 antibodies against 4 P. falciparum strains that carry the 3 main block 2 sequence alleles. These antibodies were able to inhibit in vitro growth of P. falciparum only in cooperation with human monocytes, whereas no direct inhibition was observed. However, the ADCI effect was strictly allele specific. Our findings highlight a new mechanism involving MSP1 in the protection against malaria."
CD008122,0,19147413,0,"Simultaneous liquid chromatographic analysis of ritonavir, quinine and 3-hydroxyquinine in human plasma.","In regions with high prevalence of HIV and malaria, co-infection of both diseases is common; hence, there is a high possibility of concurrent administration of antiretroviral and antimalarial drugs. This study describes a new ion-pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for simultaneous determinations of ritonavir (RTV), quinine (QN), and its major metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine (3-HQN), in human plasma. Following a simple extraction with diethyl-ether under alkaline conditions, chromatographic separation was achieved on a 5-mum particle size C-18 column (200 mm x 4.6mm I.D.) using a mobile phase consisting of methanol:acetonitrile:0.02 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate (15:10:75) containing 75 mmol/L perchloric acid (pH 2.8). Retention times for RTV, 3-HQN, QN and the internal standard were 2.8, 4.0, 7.0 and 12 min, respectively. The limits of detection and validated lower limits of quantitation were 10 and 12.5 ng/ml for RTV while the corresponding values were 5 and 70 ng/ml for both QN and 3-HQN, respectively. The new HPLC method is simple, rapid, selective, reproducible and cost-effective. As demonstrated in three volunteers, it will facilitate the conducting of simultaneous therapeutic monitoring of quinine and ritonavir in patients concurrently receiving both drugs."

While the existing methods were developed for the determination of either AS or AQ in biological fluids, the current validated method allows simultaneous extraction and determination of AS and AQ in human plasma. Extraction is carried out on Supelclean LC-18 extraction cartridges where AS, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and the internal standard artemisinin (QHS) are separated from AQ, its metabolite desethylamodiaquine (DeAQ) and the internal standard, an isobutyl analogue of desethylamodiaquine (IB-DeAQ). AS, DHA and QHS are then analysed using Hypersil C4 column with acetonitrile-acetic acid (0.05M adjusted to pH 5.2 with 1.00M NaOH) (42:58, v/v) as mobile phase at flow rate 1.50ml/min. The analytes are detected with an electrochemical detector operating in the reductive mode. Chromatography of AQ, DeAQ and IB-DeAQ is carried out on an Inertsil C4 column with acetonitrile-KH(2)PO(4) (pH 4.0, 0.05M) (11:89, v/v) as mobile phase at flow rate 1.00ml/min. The analytes are detected by an electrochemical detector operating in the oxidative mode. The recoveries of AS, DHA, AQ and DeAQ vary between 79.1% and 104.0% over the concentration range of 50-1400ng/ml plasma. The accuracies of the determination of all the analytes are 96.8-103.9%, while the variation for within-day and day-to-day analysis are <15%. The lower limit of quantification for all the analytes is 20ng/ml and limit of detection is 8ng/ml. The method is sensitive, selective, accurate, reproducible and suited particularly for pharmacokinetic study of AS-AQ drug combination and can also be used to compare the bioavailability of different formulations, including a fixed-dose AS-AQ co-formulation."

Field-collected mosquitoes, which had been stored dry for over 2 years, were screened first for human IgG by ELISA. In 141 blood meal samples from human-fed mosquitoes, the prevalence of stage-specific antibodies was 87.9% for asexual-stage parasites, 78.0% for gametocytes, and 87.9% for sporozoites. There were no differences in the prevalence of stage-specific antibodies for mosquitoes collected from 2 sites, before and after the long rainy season of 1988.

CD008122,0,9025981,0,High prevalence of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum infection in Rajasthan epidemic.,"Plasmodium falciparum is the main killer among all human malaria parasites. In 1994, there was a falciparum malaria epidemic in Rajasthan, India, with many deaths. We have investigated active falciparum malaria cases from this epidemic and found that most of the parasite isolates (95%) were resistant to chloroquine. Nevertheless, all the tested isolates from the epidemic, were sensitive to mefloquine and quinine and ninety percent were also susceptible to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Most individuals had moderate levels of TNF-alpha (20-220 pg/ml) and anti-parasite IgM antibodies compared to IgG levels which were relatively lower. In conclusion, the high transmission rate of the chloroquine resistant P. falciparum parasite could be the probable cause of the disease epidemic in Rajasthan. The timely drug sensitivity test and availability of appropriate antimalarial drugs are, therefore, warranted."

The group studied included 184 subjects of all ages that assisted to the local health center for malaria diagnosis. Analysis performed included hematology by coulter counter, ferritin quantification by ELISA with monoclonal antibodies and folic acid and vitamin B12 determinations by an immunoradiometric assay. It was found that the prevalence of anemia was 89.6% and deficiencies of iron, folic acid and vitamin B12 affected 37.1,70.3 and 12.4% of the population studied, respectively. Plasmodium infection was detected by molecular diagnosis in 53.2% of the cases, and 86% of them were anemic. The highest incidence of anemia was found in children, with a prevalence of 100% in infants of both sexes. The high prevalence of anemia, iron and folic acid deficiencies found, indicates an important health and nutrition problem that should be immediately and properly addressed. The number of cases of anemia due to iron deficiency could be underestimated, since ferritin concentration increased as a acute phase protein, although prevalence data was also analyzed with a cutoff point of 30 microg/L for ferritin concentration."
CD008122,0,7955774,0,Clinical pharmacokinetics of halofantrine.,"Halofantrine is a phenanthrenemethanol antimalarial that is effective against asexual forms of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. It has no action on gametocytes or hypnozoites in the liver. The drug is administered as a racemic mixture but the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers show no difference in activity in vitro. Three formulations for oral administration are available for human use, i.e. tablets, capsules and suspension. Toxicity studies in animals suggest that halofantrine has very low toxicity both in short term and long term animal studies, and there has been no evidence of mutagenicity in these studies. Phase I, II and III clinical trials of halofantrine conducted in several tropical countries found the drug to be well tolerated and effective against multidrug-resistant P. falciparum malaria when 500mg was administered every 6 hours for 3 doses. The majority of clinical adverse effects reported, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, orthostatic hypotension, prolongation of QTc interval, pruritus and rash, have been mild and transient. There is wide interindividual variation in halofantrine absorption. The maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) is achieved approximately 6 hours after oral administration. Bioavailability is not dose-proportional for doses over 500mg, but there is a dose-proportional increase in Cmax and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for doses between 250 and 500mg. In patients with malaria the bioavailability of halofantrine is decreased. The mean half-life of absorption is 4 hours and Cmax is significantly lower than that obtained in healthy individuals. Furthermore, halofantrine absorption is enhanced when the drug is taken with fatty food. Therefore, halofantrine should be taken with food to ensure optimal absorption in patients with malaria. The terminal elimination half-life is 5 days in patients with malaria. Halofantrine is biotransformed in the liver to its major metabolite N-debutyl-halofantrine. Plasma concentrations of this metabolite are observed soon after administration of halofantrine, but in much lower concentrations. The elimination half-life is similar to that of halofantrine. There have been increasing reports of halofantrine treatment failure, particularly in the eastern part of Thailand. The majority of treatment failures have been associated with incomplete drug absorption. The dose-dependent cardiotoxic effects (e.g. cardiac arrhythmia) are a major concern, particularly when the bioavailability of the drug cannot be predicted. Ongoing and future studies should aim at developing more appropriate drug formulation(s) and/or optimising dosage regimens. This will allow therapeutic concentrations to be achieved with minimum adverse effects, particularly cardiotoxicity."
CD008122,0,17060469,0,Mimotopes of apical membrane antigen 1: Structures of phage-derived peptides recognized by the inhibitory monoclonal antibody 4G2dc1 and design of a more active analogue.,"Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is an integral membrane protein that plays a key role in merozoite invasion of host erythrocytes. A monoclonal antibody, 4G2dc1, recognizes correctly folded AMA1 and blocks merozoite invasion. Phage display was used to identify peptides that bind to 4G2dc1 and mimic an important epitope of AMA1. Three of the highest-affinity binders--J1, J3, and J7--were chosen for antigenicity and immunogenicity studies. J1 and J7 were found to be true antigen mimics since both peptides generated inhibitory antibodies in rabbits (J. L. Casey et al., Infect. Immun. 72:1126-1134, 2004). In the present study, the solution structures of all three mimotopes were investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. J1 adopted a well-defined region of structure, which can be attributed in part to the interactions of Trp11 with surrounding residues. In contrast, J3 and J7 did not adopt an ordered conformation over the majority of residues, although they share a region of local structure across their consensus sequence. Since J1 was the most structured of the peptides, it provided a template for the design of a constrained analogue, J1cc, which shares a structure similar to that of J1 and has a disulfide-stabilized conformation around the Trp11 region. J1cc binds with greater affinity to 4G2dc1 than does J1. These peptide structures provide the foundation for a better understanding of the complex conformational nature of inhibitory epitopes on AMA1. With its greater conformational stability and higher affinity for AMA1, J1cc may be a better in vitro correlate of immunity than the peptides identified by phage display."
CD008122,0,3042448,0,"Aspects of imported malaria at a district general hospital in non-endemic Kuwait, Arabian Gulf.","There is no indigenous mosquito-borne transmission of malaria in Kuwait. However, in a five year period at a district general hospital, the number of laboratory-diagnosed cases of malaria increased annually from 25 to 84, a rise of 336%. Except for two induced infections, all were imported, mainly from the Indian subcontinent. Plasmodium vivax was responsible for 87.29% of the cases; P.falciparum (12.05%), a mixed infection of P.vivax and P.falciparum (0.33%) and a case of P.ovale (0.33%) were also identified. Rapid preparation of acetone-fixed, Giemsa-stained thick blood films, a heightened awareness of the infection, examination of multiple samples of blood from patients and the general resurgence of malaria in endemic areas were some of the factors responsible for the high number of cases diagnosed. Most patients were young males and presented with clinical malaria due to P.vivax between May and October each year, an apparent seasonal peak. However, many were already resident in the country for a variable period. Patients with P.falciparum though, presented clinically within two weeks of arrival in the country. Parasite densities were calculated to monitor the progress of treatment and identify quickly any possible chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum strains. A policy of active prophylaxis is suggested to stem the tide of imported malaria."
CD008122,0,12518844,1,Short report: Failure of the OptiMAL rapid malaria test as a tool for the detection of asymptomatic malaria in an area of Thailand endemic for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax.,"We evaluated the efficacy of the OptiMAL assay in a cross-sectional malaria survey in western Thailand from April to August 2001. Expert microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films was used as the gold standard. Positive control lines were evident in 99% (1,128 of 1,137) of the assays tested. However, 34% (384 of 1,128) of assays produced an aberrant result (a positive P. falciparum-specific line and a negative panmalarial line). False-positive panmalarial and Plasmodium falciparum-specific lines occurred in 25.9% (270 of 1,042) and 60.3% (628 of 1,042) of microscopy-negative samples, respectively. Due to the preponderance of false-positive test results, it was necessary to develop subjective criteria for test positivity based on line intensity. For determination of assay performance during this study, we therefore considered all test lines that were scored as intermediate or strong as positive and lines that were faint as negative. Using these criteria, we determined that the sensitivity of the OptiMAL assay for P. falciparum was 25% with > 500 parasites/microl and 10.5% with > 100 parasites/microl, while for P. vivax, the sensitivity at the same parasite rates was 100% and 41.7%, respectively. Further studies are required to determine whether the problems we identified are limited to this particular lot of OptiMAL assays."

In P. falciparum, the cause of the most lethal human malaria, chloroquine resistance is linked to multiple mutations in PfCRT, a protein that likely functions as a transporter in the parasite's digestive vacuole membrane. Rapid diagnostic assays for PfCRT mutations are already employed as surveillance tools for drug resistance. However, several reports have been published demonstrating cases with CO resistance. Sporadic cases have been reported as well as one large scale study demonstrated 12.4% resistance. However, all these reports were based on treatment failure (in vivo). rather than in vitro or molecular bases. Evidence suggests a crucial role for a point mutation in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene on chromosome 7 in conferring CQ resistance. The mutation in the K76 codon in 3 cases out of 60 (5%) using ApoI restriction enzyme was detected. Although the percentage of drug resistance was not quite disturbing, but represented the possible establishment of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum in Saudi Arabia, or the beginning of resistant strains by labors coming from abroad. Cross-border importation of resistant strains from neighboring countries must be considered. In vivo tests must be conducted parallel with the molecular markers to estimate more precisely the actual prevalence of resistance. Validation of molecular markers is urgently required and needs strong collaborative partnerships between subregional and regional networks."

It regulates IgG1 production and co-operates with IL-4 in the production of multiple antibody classes in vivo. IgG1 and IgG3 are critically involved in the development of clinical immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, the mechanisms driving class-switch recombination towards these specific isotypes remain to be elucidated. Seventy-three children with P. falciparum-positive, thick blood smears were recruited from the pediatric wards of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital and the General Hospital in Lambaréné. Children were grouped into two categories according to age: group A (1 to 5 years old) and group B (6 to 16 years old). Patients with severe (severe anemia and/or hyperparasitemia) and mild malaria were enrolled. Prevalence and level of IL-21, total IgG and subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) titers were determined in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Plasma IL-21 levels correlated with IgG1 and IgG3 levels. Additionally, plasma IL-21 levels correlated with hemoglobin levels in younger children and with parasite density. Here we describe the relationship between IL-21 and antibodies for erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 (EBA-175) peptide 4, a malaria vaccine candidate in Gabonese children with acute falciparum malaria. This study provides new insights into the field of malaria."

This polymerized peptide vaccine incorporates a portion of each of the 35-kD, 55-kD, and 83-kD blood-stage proteins, linked by an amino acid sequence reproducing one repeat from the circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum. Results from this study show that vaccination with this vaccine molecule elicited high titers of antibodies to SPf66 and its constituents, but these antibodies did not correlate with regular or sensitive indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titers to blood-stage malaria parasites. However, rabbits injected with individual peptides produced antibodies with low affinity to indefinite parasite structures by immunoelectron microscopy, and rabbits injected with SPf66 had high antibody titers against the peptide (NANP)40. Consequently, these anti-SPf66 serum samples recognized P. falciparum sporozoites in the IFA. Such reactivity was not observed in monkeys or human volunteers vaccinated with SPf66. In addition, SPf66 components were recognized by antibodies induced by natural infection in humans and by laboratory-monitored infections in Aotus monkeys. These results suggest that this vaccine candidate merits further developmental work to better define immune response elicited by the copolymer to the parasite."

A hospital-based study, described here, was carried out in a malaria mesoendemic area in eastern Sudan, where the inhabitants are semi-immune to malaria, and the fever threshold of parasitemia is not above the detection level of microscopy. Thus, we hypothesized that patients with symptoms highly suggestive of cerebral malaria (CM), but aparasitemic by microscopy, may have submicroscopic parasitemia. Patients in our malaria clinic were screened by microscopy, and 120 individuals were selected for the study, including febrile patients with and without microscopically detectable parasitemia, and apparently healthy individuals. In the two former groups there were patients with severe anemia and deep coma. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for parasite detection and ELISA tests for measuring serum antibody levels were carried out on all blood samples. A majority of the febrile patients who were parasite negative by microscopy showed the presence of a Plasmodium falciparum infection by PCR. The occurrence of P. falciparum infection with parasitemia below the detection level of microscopy was recognized more often in patients with CM symptoms than in those with severe malarial anemia (SMA), and in older rather than younger patients. Patients clinically suspected (CS) of having CM ((CS)CM) mostly were infected with a single clone, and a large proportion of them acquired antibodies (Abs) against merozoite surface protein (MSP) antigens (Ags). The therapeutic response to quinine treatment was comparable between patients with (CS)CM and CM. In conclusion, uniquely in this setting, CM can be associated with sub-patent parasitemia; thus, a diagnostic tool more sensitive than microscopy is needed."

CD008122,0,16912713,0,Ensuring quality and access for malaria diagnosis: how can it be achieved?,"The replacement of conventional antimalarial drugs with high-cost, artemisinin-based alternatives has created a gap in the successful management of malaria. This gap reflects an increased need for accurate disease diagnosis that cannot be met by traditional microscopy techniques. The recent introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has the potential to meet this need, but successful RDT implementation has been curtailed by poor product performance, inadequate methods to determine the quality of products and a lack of emphasis and capacity to deal with these issues. Economics and a desire for improved case management will result in the rapid growth of RDT use in the coming years. However, for their potential to be realized, it is crucial that high-quality RDT products that perform reliably and accurately under field conditions are made available. In achieving this goal, the shift from symptom-based diagnosis to parasite-based management of malaria can bring significant improvements to tropical fever management, rather than represent a further burden on poor, malaria-endemic populations and their overstretched health services."

Groups of patients were selected according to the predilection of members of the genus Encephalitozoon for nervous and kidney tissue. Female prostitutes and alcohol and intravenous drug abusers were selected as groups at risk of HIV/AIDS infections. A total of 401 samples of human sera were examined for the presence of antimicrosporidial IgG antibodies by ELISA test with a titre of 600 considered borderline positivity. The highest occurrence of antimicrosporidial antibodies was found in the groups of alcohol abusers (16% from 43 patients), intravenous drug abusers (11% from 9 patients) and prostitutes (10% from 80 women) for E. cuniculi antigen and in the groups of psychiatric patients (14% from 44 patients), malaria patients (11% from 38 patients) and alcohol abusers (7% from 43 patients) for E. hellem antigen. The occurrence of specific antibodies of the six examined diagnostic units (glomerulonephritis chronica, pyelonephritis chronica, schizophrenia, dementia, multiple sclerosis and cerebral stroke) was statistically significant only in patients with pyelonephritis chronica and dementia (p < 0.05). No cases of microsporidial infection were found among the female prostitutes by parasitological examination, although one case of giardiasis was identified. Sera of patients with high anti-E. cuniculi and anti-E. hellem antibodies (titres in ELISA of 600 and above) were confirmed by Western blot using E. cuniculi and E. hellem polypeptides, respectively. These results suggest that the examined patients could show residual antibodies from past or latent infections."
CD008122,0,11159991,0,Antibody responses to infections with strains of Plasmodium falciparum expressing diverse forms of merozoite surface protein 2.,"Individuals living in areas where Plasmodium falciparum is endemic experience numerous episodes of infection. These episodes may or may not be symptomatic, with the outcome depending on a combination of parasite and host factors, several of which are poorly understood. One factor is believed to be the particular alleles of several parasite proteins to which the host is capable of mounting protective immune responses. We report a study examining antibody responses to MSP2 in 15 semi-immune teenagers and adults living in the Khanh-Hoa area of southern-central Vietnam, where P. falciparum is highly endemic; subjects were serially infected with multiple strains of P. falciparum. The MSP2 alleles infecting these subjects were determined by nucleotide sequencing. A total of 62 MSP2 genes belonging to both dimorphic families were identified, of which 33 contained distinct alleles, with 61% of the alleles being detected once. Clear changes in the repertoire occurred between infections. Most infections contained a mixture of parasites expressing MSP2 alleles from both dimorphic families. Two examples of reinfection with a strain expressing a previously encountered allele were detected. Significant changes in antibody levels to various regions of MSP2 were detected over the course of the experiment. There was no clear relation between the infecting form of MSP2 and the ensuing antibody response. This study highlights the complexity of host-parasite relationship for this important human pathogen."
CD008122,0,1730745,0,"Biological activities of peptides and peptide analogues derived from common sequences present in thrombospondin, properdin, and malarial proteins.","Thrombospondin (TSP), a major platelet-secreted protein, has recently been shown to have activity in tumor cell metastasis, cell adhesion, and platelet aggregation. The type 1 repeats of TSP contain two copies of CSVTCG and one copy of CSTSCG, per each of the three polypeptide chains of TSP and show homology with peptide sequences found in a number of other proteins including properdin, malarial circumsporozoite, and a blood-stage antigen of Plasmodium falciparum. To investigate whether these common sequences functioned as a cell adhesive domain in TSP, we assessed the effect of peptides corresponding to these sequences and an antibody raised against one of these sequences, CSTSCG, in three biological assays which depend, in part, on the cell adhesive activity of TSP. These assays were TSP-dependent cell adhesion, platelet aggregation, and tumor cell metastasis. We found that a number of peptides homologous to CSVTCG promoted the adhesion of a variety of cells including mouse B16-F10 melanoma cells, inhibited platelet aggregation and tumor cell metastasis, whereas control peptides had no effect. Anti-CSTSCG, which specifically recognized TSP, inhibited TSP-dependent cell adhesion, platelet aggregation, and tumor cell metastasis, whereas control IgG had no effect. These results suggest that CSVTCG and CSTSCG present in the type I repeats function in the adhesive interactions of TSP that mediate cell adhesion, platelet aggregation, and tumor cell metastasis. Peptides, based on the structure of these repeats, may find wide application in the treatment of thrombosis and in the prevention of cancer spread."
CD008122,0,12224568,1,"Assessing the Parasight-F test in northeastern Papua, Indonesia, an area of mixed Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax transmission.","User-friendly, reliable, and inexpensive methods for diagnosing malaria are needed at the primary health care level. During a randomized treatment trial, the Parasight-F test was assessed on days 0, 3, 7, and 28 against standard light microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick blood smears for diagnosing Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in patients with P. falciparum (n = 84) or P. vivax (n = 59) malaria. The median P. falciparum parasite count on day 0 was 2,373/microL (range = 20-74,432/microL). At the start of treatment, the Parasight-F test had a sensitivity of 95.2% (80 of 84; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 88.2-98.7), and a specificity of 94.9% (56 of 59; 95% CI = 85.8-98.9). On day 7, this test showed false-positive results in 17 (16.3%) of 104 patients (95% CI = 9.8-24.9). The Parasight-F test performed well when compared with light microscopy in detecting P. falciparum parasitemia in patients presenting with clinical malaria. However, the high false-positive rate on day 7 limits its use for patient follow-up."

CD008122,0,9234748,0,Complement-mediated lysis of Plasmodium falciparum gametes by malaria-immune human sera is associated with antibodies to the gamete surface antigen Pfs230.,"Antibodies to the sexual-stage surface antigens of Plasmodium falciparum, Pfs230 and Pfs48/45, can abolish the infectivity of gametes to mosquitoes; these antigens have been proposed as candidates for inclusion in a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine. One possible mechanism of antibody-mediated transmission blocking is complement-mediated gamete lysis. We have used a panel of human sera from geographically distinct regions where malaria is endemic to investigate whether this may be a mechanism of naturally acquired transmission-blocking immunity to P. falciparum. By immunoprecipitation, we have shown that antibody recognition of Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 is limited, despite universal exposure to P. falciparum gametocytes. In vitro complement-mediated lysis of P. falciparum gametes was positively associated with the presence of antibodies to Pfs230 but not with antibodies to the N-terminal region of the precursor molecule (Pfs260), which is shed from the gametocyte surface at the time of gametogenesis. Similarly, antibodies to two other gametocyte-specific proteins, Pfs48/45 and Pfg27/25, were not associated with gamete lysis. All sera which mediate gamete lysis contain immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and/or IgG3 antibodies to gamete surface proteins as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These data suggest that Pfs230 is a major target of complement-fixing antibodies which may be important for antibody-mediated transmission-blocking immunity."
CD008122,0,7020453,0,The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for malaria. III. Antibody response in documented Plasmodium falciparum infections.,"Serum specimens from patients in El Salvador, Central America, with slide-proven Plasmodium falciparum infections were examined for antibodies to P. falciparum using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) methods. Both serologic tests were positive in 78.1% of the 827 samples, both negative in 5.4%, the ELISA positive alone in 6.3%, and the IFA alone in 10.2%. Agreement between the serologic tests was better in the specimens with high positive titers (high IFA = high ELISA). Seropositivity rates and geometric mean titers were higher in the older (greater than or equal to 15 years) age groups for both ELISA and IFA; in such persons, the IFA was positive in 92% and the ELISA in 88%. The lowest seropositivity rates found by the ELISA were observed in children; 27.6% of 98 children less than or equal to 4 years of age were negative. A longer duration of infection as evidenced by the presence of gametocytes on the blood slide resulted in higher positivity rates by both ELISA and IFA. This phenomenon, particularly apparent in young children, supports the belief that the more important variable in determining the proportion of false negatives is previous malaria experience and not age. The results indicate that, while neither serologic test is appropriate as a diagnostic aid, both the ELISA and the IFA would be useful in epidemiologic investigations."

CD008122,0,17259881,0,Care and treatment of HIV-infected children in Africa: issues and challenges at the district hospital level.,"More than 90% of pediatric HIV infection occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and 75% of these children currently die before their fifth birthday. Most HIV-infected children in Africa rely on district hospitals for HIV treatment, but insufficient attention has been paid to improving HIV/AIDS care at this level. Considerable confusion exists about optimal use of combination antiretroviral treatment, prophylaxis for opportunistic infections and other rational healthcare interventions that can greatly improve the quality of life for these children. A simple and inexpensive infant HIV diagnostic assay and alternative laboratory markers of pediatric HIV disease progression would be highly beneficial. Routine anthropometric and neurodevelopmental assessments could help guide initiation and monitoring of antiretroviral therapy. Even in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, interventions such as immunizations, provision of micronutrients and nutrition counseling, prevention and treatment of opportunistic as well as endemic infections (such as helminths and malaria) can substantially reduce pediatric HIV-related morbidity and mortality. The need for pain relief, palliative care, counseling and emotional support is often underestimated. Surmounting the sense of hopelessness by providing district healthcare workers with training in basic pediatric HIV/AIDS care is an urgent priority."
CD008122,0,11716119,0,Identification of cryptic coinfection with Plasmodium falciparum in patients presenting with vivax malaria.,"In Thailand, approximately 8% of patients treated for vivax malaria are found subsequently to have coinfection with Plasmodium falciparum. A P. falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2) dipstick test was evaluated as a predictor of mixed infections with subpatent P. falciparum in a prospective study of 238 patients admitted to the hospital with acute vivax malaria. Of these, 23 (10%) had subsequent development of falciparum malaria without reexposure. Patients with cryptic P. falciparum infection had a significantly lower mean (standard deviation) hematocrit than those with P. vivax alone: 29.6 (7.6%) versus 37.2 (6.4%) (P < 0.0001). Using microscopic appearance of P. falciparum after the start of treatment as the reference standard, the PfHRP-2 test was 74% sensitive and 99% specific in predicting mixed infections with subpatent P. falciparum parasitemia at presentation. The PfHRP-2 dipstick test may be a useful adjunct to microscopy in areas where mixed infections are common."
CD008122,0,19439103,0,Influence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum.,"During pregnancy, women are more susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum infections and frequently have a higher parasitaemia than non-pregnant women. Several mechanisms are responsible for their increased susceptibility, including down-modulation of immune responses that aid in parasite clearance and sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the placenta. Early in pregnancy, a third mechanism may contribute to higher parasitaemia, since it has been reported that addition of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to in vitro cultures of the NF54-strain of P. falciparum results in increased parasite growth rates. The goal of this study was to further examine the effect of hCG on P. falciparum growth."
CD008122,0,2012263,0,A longitudinal study of seroreactivities to Plasmodium falciparum antigens in infants and children living in a holoendemic area of Liberia.,"Investigators studied 348 children age 0-10 years, living in a holoendemic area of Liberia, for parasitological, serological and clinical parameters. The age-specific parasite rate increased towards the 7-10 year-old age group in which it was 86.8%. The geometrical mean parasite density decreased from the 3-4 year-old age group, in which fewer episodes of clinical malaria were observed. Antibodies to crude Plasmodium falciparum parasite antigens were detected in all children. The (EENV)6 seropositive rate was a maximum of 67.9% in the 3-11 month-old age group. It declined to a minimum of 31.7% in the 5-6 years age group after which it increased slowly in the 7-10 years age group. Antibodies to the synthetic peptide (NANP)6 showed a steady seropositive rate after the age of 3 months, between 30.0% and 39.3% in all the age groups up to 10 years. No statistically significant correlation was found between seropositivity to (EENV)6 and malarial parasitemia. In contrast, a statistically significant positive correlation was found between seropositivity to (NANP)6 and parasite rates. The antibody response for the individual child was transient to both Pf155/RESA, measured by immunofluorescence, and to (EENV)6 and (NANP)6, measured by ELISA, especially in the younger age groups of this study population. Parasitological and clinical immunity developed before a stable antibody response to these defined malaria antigens was established. These antibodies may still contribute to the immune protection against malaria, but they were not reliable parameters for protective immunity in the population we studied."

CD008122,0,1406728,1,Colorimetric detection of Plasmodium falciparum and direct sequencing of amplified gene fragments using a solid phase method.,"A rapid colorimetric assay for the detection of DNA from Plasmodium falciparum malaria is described, allowing direct sequencing of amplified fragments in the positive samples. The method is based on amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with incorporation of biotin and a lac operator sequence in the amplified target DNA. The PCR product was immobilized on streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads, and detected by the specific binding of an Escherichia coli lac repressor beta-galactosidase fusion protein. Positive samples were subsequently treated with alkali to generate single stranded templates, which were used for solid phase genomic sequencing. As targets for amplification and sequencing we selected a region of the gene for the antigen Pf155/RESA and a region of the parasite dihydrofolate reductase gene (PfDHFR/TS). We show here that both of these gene targets can be used for specific detection of P. falciparum in patient blood samples. Genomic sequencing of five patient isolates revealed no variation in the Pf155/RESA gene fragment. In a comparison of this sequence with conserved protein domains, a marked similarity to the src homology region 3 was detected. A point mutation was found in the PfDHFR/TS gene fragment of one of the clinical samples, replacing Ser108 with Asn. This mutation has earlier been described in pyrimethamine and cycloguanile-resistant strains of P. falciparum."
CD008122,0,8447525,0,Evaluation of a nonisotopic DNA assay kit for diagnosing Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Madagascar.,"This study evaluated a nonisotopic DNA assay kit for diagnosing Plasmodium falciparum malaria in an area of Madagascar where all Plasmodium species of human malaria are present and where malaria is endemic. Blood samples from 440 healthy children and 20 healthy adults were processed and assayed in a single day in a blind protocol. The parasitemia levels of the four Plasmodium species were determined by microscopic examinations and by counts of numbers of malaria parasites per 1,000 white blood cells. Relative to P. falciparum infections, the DNA assay results agreed with those of microscopy for 207 positive and 239 negative samples; two samples were scored as positive by the DNA probe that were not detected by microscopy, and 12 samples were scored as positive by microscopy but were not detected by the assay. Relative to microscopy, the sensitivity of the assay was 95%, the specificity was 99%, and the effective sensitivity threshold of the DNA probe assay was approximately 30 parasites/mm3 of blood. The assay did not detect infections with either P. vivax, P. malariae, or P. ovale alone, but detected mixed infections of P. falciparum with either P. vivax or P. ovale. With this nonisotopic DNA probe assay, we were able to process large numbers of samples efficiently and to detect P. falciparum malaria infections with high sensitivity and specificity in a population that did not display overt disease symptoms."

CD008122,0,8447528,0,"Prevalence of serum antibodies to human T lymphotropic virus-1 in an isolated tribe in the highlands of Irian Jaya, Indonesia.","There have been several recent reports on the high prevalence of serum antibodies to human T lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) in isolated populations residing in the coastal areas and highlands of Papua New Guinea. In the absence of significant cases of clinical disease, it has been surmised that this reactivity might be the consequence of serologic recognition of yet undefined human retroviruses or parasite antigens. These observations prompted an investigation of the prevalence of anti-HTLV-1 antibodies among members of the Ngalum tribe that dwells in a secluded highland valley in the eastern Jayawijaya Mountains of Irian Jaya, Indonesian New Guinea. Of 165 tribespeople, 85 (52%) were positive for IgG antibodies to HTLV-1 in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Eighty-two were more than 10 years of age. On the Western blot, all positive sera reacted strongly with the p19 core antigen, but recognition of the envelope antigens, gp46 and gp21, was conspicuously absent. Thirty-four of the 85 villagers with these indeterminant blots had active Plasmodium falciparum infections, but antibody absorption studies with HTLV-1 and P. falciparum erythrocytic stage antigens failed to confirm suspected serologic cross-reactivities. Thirty-three others had acute malaria and/or high titers of anti-malaria antibodies but were seronegative for HTLV-1. We suspect that indeterminant Western blots for HTLV-1 reflect antibody responses to related latent retroviruses that are activated as a consequence of immunosuppression following malaria infection and chloroquine therapy."

A large number of studies in Africa have reported the existence of anopheline populations resistant to various insecticides, partly due to knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations, but few operational wide-scale control programmes were coupled with the monitoring of such mutations. The distribution of the kdr-west (kdr-w) Leu-Phe mutation was studied in Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations from Niger and temporal variations were monitored following the nationwide LLIN implementation."
CD008122,0,9561595,0,"Phase II trial in China of a new, rapidly-acting and effective oral antimalarial, CGP 56697, for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.","One hundred and two Chinese out-patients with naturally acquired, previously untreated, falciparum malaria were selected to evaluate the efficacy of a new combination anti-malaria therapy, CGP 56697 (artemether plus benflumetol). In this open non-comparative trial each patient received a combination of 80 mg artemether and 480 mg benflumetol given orally at 0, 8, 24 and 48 hours (total: 320 mg artemether, 1,920 mg benflumetol). Patients were kept for 28 days in a transmission-free hospital in an area with chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria to prevent reinfection and to aid diagnosis of recrudescence. Progress and possible adverse effects were monitored by blood film parasitology, blood biochemistry assays, urinalysis, ECG and X-ray. Ninety-eight of the 102 patients were shown to be free of infection at 28 days, a 96.1% cure rate. Parasite reduction at 24 hours was 99.4%. Time to effect complete parasite clearance ranged from 24 to 54 hours (median 30 hours). Time for fever clearance ranged from 6 to 78 hours (median 18 hours). Recrudescence was low (3.9%). No significant adverse side-effects were encountered. It is concluded that CGP 56697, a combination anti-malaria therapy of artemether with benflumetol, offered a rapid and highly effective treatment for acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria in an area of chloroquine-resistant malaria in China."
CD008122,0,9196768,0,Pharmacokinetics of oral artesunate in children with moderately severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"The pharmacokinetic properties of oral artesunate (3 mg/kg) were determined in 10 Vietnamese children, aged from 6 to 15 years, with acute falciparum malaria of moderate severity. Plasma concentrations were measured using a bioassay and expressed in terms of antimalarial activity equivalent to dihydroartemisinin, the principal biologically active metabolite. Oral artesunate was absorbed rapidly with a mean time to peak plasma bioactivity of 1.7 h (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.8-2.6). There was wide variation in peak plasma concentrations with a mean value equivalent to 664 ng of dihydroartemisinin/mL (95% CI 387-9410, range 179-1395) and a four-fold variation in the area under the plasma concentration-time curves. Elimination from plasma was rapid with a mean (95% CI) half-life of 1.0 h (95% CI 0.8-1.4). Plasma antimalarial levels were below the limit of detection in all cases by 12 h, despite the relatively high dose of artesunate used. Oral artesunate is rapidly absorbed and rapidly eliminated in children with moderately severe malaria but there is considerable variation between individuals."
CD008122,0,12930610,0,Reactivity of sera from cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria towards three recombinant antigens based on the surface proteins of the parasite.,"Sera collected in South Korea, from 61 cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria and, as controls, 40 healthy volunteers, were tested in ELISA for IgG or IgM reacting with any of three recombinant P. vivax proteins. The antigens used, representing the parasite's major merozoite surface protein (MSP), circumsporozoite surface protein (CSP) and Duffy-binding protein (DBP), had all been expressed in an Escherichia coli system and purified. The ELISA results were recorded as optical densities (OD). The highest ratio observed between the mean OD for a malaria serum and that for a control serum was that for IgG against MSP, although CSP gave a higher ratio than MSP or DBP in the IgM ELISA. In the ELISA for IgG, the OD for MSP were found to be correlated with those for DBP (r = 0.53; P < 0.5) but the OD for CSP were not correlated with those for MSP or DBP. As the most intense reactions observed were those between the IgG from the malaria sera and the recombinant MSP, the latter antigen may be useful in diagnostic tests and as a component of any vaccine used to protect against P. vivax malaria."
CD008122,0,18603111,0,Adherence and effectiveness of drug combination in curative treatment among children suffering uncomplicated malaria in rural Senegal.,"Increased Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine has prompted national malaria programs to develop new policies in several African countries. Less than a year after the introduction of amodiaquine/sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ/SP) as first-line treatment in Senegal, we examined adherence rates to therapy and its efficacy among children. The study was conducted in five dispensaries in rural Senegal. Children aged 2-10 years with a presumptive diagnosis of malaria were prescribed AQ/SP. Thick blood film analyses were carried out on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28. Blood and urine samples were collected on day 3 for drug level measurements. The principal caregivers were questioned on treatment adherence. Among the 289 recruited children, 144 had a parasitemia >2500/microl. The results demonstrated markedly good efficacy for the treatment, as no detectable parasitemia was observed on day 28 for 97.9% of the children. However, we noticed that 35.3% of children did not comply with the recommended doses and 62.3% did not exactly adhere to the drug schedule. Despite the good efficacy of the drugs, adherence to the therapeutic scheme was poor. Strategies to promote patient adherence would improve drug performance and thus might help to prevent the rapid emergence of drug resistance."

CD008122,0,19461094,0,Requirements for diagnosis of malaria at different levels of the laboratory network in Africa.,"The rapid increase of resistance to cheap, reliable antimalarials, the increasing cost of effective drugs, and the low specificity of clinical diagnosis has increased the need for more reliable diagnostic methods for malaria. The most commonly used and most reliable remains microscopic examination of stained blood smears, but this technique requires skilled personnel, precision instruments, and ideally a source of electricity. Microscopy has the advantage of enabling the examiner to identify the species, stage, and density of an infection. An alternative to microscopy is the rapid diagnostic test (RDT), which uses a labeled monoclonal antibody to detect circulating parasitic antigens. This test is most commonly used to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections and is available in a plastic cassette format. Both microscopy and RDTs should be available at all levels of laboratory service in endemic areas, but in peripheral laboratories with minimally trained staff, the RDT may be a more practical diagnostic method."
CD008122,0,1791456,0,"Malaria transmission potential by Anopheles mosquitoes of Dajabon, Dominican Republic.","A field and laboratory study was conducted to determine some of the parameters relevant to malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes in Dajabon Province, Dominican Republic. Although all 4 species occurring in the area, i.e., An. albimanus, An. crucians, An. grabhamii and An. vestitipennis, were included in the investigations, most of the work focused on the first and last named species because of their abundance. Gonotrophic cycles were determined to be 2.6 and 3.2 days for An. albimanus and An. vestitipennis, respectively. Mean parity rates for the 2 species were 37.3 and 20.7%, respectively, in outdoor samples. The human blood index, as determined by ELISA, was 0.08 for An. albimanus and 0.12 for An. vestitipennis. Only An. albimanus was confirmed positive for Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, using ELISA. The vectorial capacity of An. albimanus was determined to be 0.019 and that of An. vestitipennis 0.005."
