CD008892,0,1545485,0,Role of ciprofloxacin in typhoid fever.,"A study was conducted to investigate the effects of ciprofloxacin in typhoid fever and to compare its efficacy with chloramphenicol. Eighty patients between 20-45 years with positive blood culture were included in the study. Seventy five percent patients treated with ciprofloxacin became afebrile within 72 hours while with chloramphenicol it took upto 120-144 hours for the same percentage of patients to become afebrile. Four patients resistant to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin/amoxycillin, also responded to ciprofloxacin. There were no significant adverse effects indicating that ciprofloxacin is safe and effective drug for resistant and nonresistant cases of typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,2279469,0,Bacterial isolates involved in cases of septicaemia in a Nigerian hospital.,"Of the nine hundred and twenty patients clinically diagnosed of having septicaemia at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria between 1980-1987, 233 (25.3%) had blood samples positive by culture. Thirteen different bacterial species were identified from positive blood cultures of which six predominated: Staphylococcus aureus (30.5%), Coliforms (17.6%), Klebsiella spp. (14.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.2%), Escherichia coli (7.9%) and Salmonella typhi (5.9%). The in vitro antibiotic, disc sensitivity pattern of the isolates showed they were relatively resistant to ampicillin and penicillin G but comparatively sensitive to antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms. Septicaemia cases were recorded in all age groups but incidence in females was slightly but not significantly higher than in males (p less than 0.05). The study reveals the predominance of S. aureus strains in case of septicaemia in Nigeria."
CD008892,0,21978238,0,Treatment guided by rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in Tanzanian children: safety and alternative bacterial diagnoses.,"WHO guidelines for the treatment of young children with suspected malaria have recently changed from presumptive treatment to anti-malarial treatment guided by a blood slide or malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT). However, there is limited evidence of the safety of this policy in routine outpatient settings in Africa."
CD008892,0,21501827,0,Activation of a RhoA/myosin II-dependent but Arp2/3 complex-independent pathway facilitates Salmonella invasion.,"Salmonella stimulates host cell invasion using virulence effectors translocated by the pathogen's type-three secretion system (T3SS). These factors manipulate host signaling pathways, primarily driven by Rho family GTPases, which culminates in Arp2/3 complex-dependent activation of host actin nucleation to mediate the uptake of Salmonella into host cells. However, recent data argue for the existence of additional mechanisms that cooperate in T3SS-dependent Salmonella invasion. We identify a myosin II-mediated mechanism, operating independent of but complementary to the Arp2/3-dependent pathway, as contributing to Salmonella invasion into nonphagocytic cells. We also establish that the T3SS effector SopB constitutes an important regulator of this Rho/Rho kinase and myosin II-dependent invasion pathway. Thus, Salmonella enters nonphagocytic cells by manipulating the two core machineries of actin-based motility in the host: Arp2/3 complex-driven actin polymerization and actomyosin-mediated contractility."
CD008892,0,23609512,0,Decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility in Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi infections in ill-returned travellers: the impact on clinical outcome and future treatment options.,"The emergence of decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (DCS) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and serovar Paratyphi A, B or C limits treatment options. We studied the impact of DCS isolates on the fate of travellers returning with enteric fever and possible alternative treatment options. We evaluated the clinical features, susceptibility data and efficacy of empirical treatment in patients with positive blood cultures of a DCS isolate compared to patients infected with a ciprofloxacin-susceptible (CS) isolate in the period from January 2002 to August 2008. In addition, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin were determined to assess if increasing the dose would result in adequate unbound fraction of the drug 24-h area under the concentration-time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (ƒAUC(0-24)/MIC) ratio. Patients with DCS more often returned from the Indian subcontinent and had a longer fever clearance time and length of hospital stay compared to patients in whom the initial empirical therapy was adequate. The mean ƒAUC(0-24)/MIC was 41.3 ± 18.8 in the patients with DCS and 585.4 ± 219 in patients with a CS isolate. For DCS isolates, the mean ƒAUC0-24/MIC for levofloxacin was 60.5 ± 28.7 and for gatifloxacin, it was 97.9 ± 28.0. Increasing the dose to an adequate ƒAUC(0-24)/MIC ratio will lead to conceivably toxic drug levels in 50% of the patients treated with ciprofloxacin. Emerging DCS isolates has led to the failure of empirical treatment in ill-returned travellers. We demonstrated that, in some cases, an adequate ƒAUC(0-24)/MIC ratio could be achieved by increasing the dose of ciprofloxacin or by the use of alternative fluoroquinolones."
CD008892,0,6415092,0,Detection and characterization of mouse monoclonal antibodies to epidemic typhus rickettsiae.,"A solid-phase immunofluorometric assay was used to detect mouse monoclonal antibodies to epidemic typhus rickettsiae, Rickettsia prowazekii (the immunizing antigen), and to murine typhus rickettsiae, Rickettsia typhi, a related antigen. Of the 649 hybridoma cultures obtained, 628 contained antibodies either to R. prowazekii or to both R. prowazekii and R. typhi. A total of 72 cultures were cloned by limiting dilution and yielded 137 antibody-producing clones. Of these, 104 produced antibodies specific for R. prowazekii, 22 produced antibodies that reacted with R. prowazekii and R. typhi, and 11 produced antibodies that reacted with R. prowazekii, R. typhi, and R. canada. The immunoglobulin isotypes of the mouse monoclonal antibodies produced were identified by a related indirect immunofluorometric assay technique with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antisera specific for each isotype. Antibodies were also evaluated by indirect fluorescent antibody tests, and antibodies from selected clones were found to neutralize rickettsial toxic activity in mice."

Its serious complication is bowel perforation with terminal ileum as the commonest perforation site. We report a case of an extremely unusual site of perforation in sigmoid colon due to typhoid fever.
CD008892,0,6756906,0,"Comparison of micro-ID with API 20E for identification of Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia species.","Micro-ID is a new kit system for the identification of Enterobacteriaceae in 4 h. It consists of 15 biochemical tests with paper discs. A study was conducted to compare the accuracy of the Micro-ID system with that of the API 20E system for identification of Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia species. Both systems correctly identified 57 out of 59 (97%) Shigella strains. Micro-ID correctly identified two Salmonella typhi strains, whereas API 20E incorrectly identified one. Of 138 Salmonella strains of other serotypes, 135 (98%) were correctly identified by Micro-ID and 130 (94%) by API 20E. The respective figures for the Yersinia strains were 40 out of 45 (89%) and 30 out of 45 (66%). It is concluded that Micro-ID is at least equal to API 20E in its ability to identify Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia species."
CD008892,0,19230587,0,Clinical features and early diagnosis of typhoid fever emphasizing usefulness of detecting mesenteric lymphadenopathy with ultrasound as diagnostic method.,"Typhoid fever is endemic in Pakistan. Most patients are children. As the symptoms and signs are often unspecific, it is difficult to diagnose typhoid fever without blood culture. We retrospectively reviewed 51 cases of typhoid fever who were all admitted from 1 June through 31 August 2002. Sixteen cases were positive by blood culture and confirmed as typhoid fever. All cases had Salmonella typhi. Although 16 cases were culture-negative, they were clinically diagnosed as typhoid fever. The remaining 19 cases were clinically diagnosed without blood culture. The clinical features of the culture-confirmed cases were more severe than the culture-negative cases. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy was very frequently detected with ultrasonography, in both culture-confirmed and culture-negative cases. The rates of detecting mesenteric lymphadenopathy were 69% and 63%, respectively. Meanwhile, the rate in non-typhoid fever patients was 5.5%. It was considered that detecting mesenteric lymphadenopathy with ultrasonography was very useful in the diagosis of typhoid fever in endemic areas."

CD008892,0,25790017,0,East London experience with enteric fever 2007-2012.,The clinical presentation and epidemiology for patients with enteric fever at two hospitals in East London during 2007-2012 is described with the aim to identify preventive opportunities and to reduce the cost of treatment.
CD008892,0,12630719,0,Antimicrobial susceptibility and distribution of non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars isolated in Malaysian children.,"There is widespread resistance of Salmonella species to commonly prescribed antimicrobials the world over. We aimed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility and serovar distribution of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) isolated from blood cultures of Malaysian children. Positive isolates of NTS from blood cultures obtained from children admitted to the pediatric wards of University of Malaya Medical Center (UMMC), a large urban hospital from Kuala Lumpur (1991-2001), and Hospital Kota Bharu (HKB), from the predominantly rural state of Kelantan (1991-1999), Malaysia, were reviewed retrospectively. Serovar distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility were ascertained. A total of 64 and 55 isolates of NTS were obtained from blood cultures of children admitted to UMMC and HKB, respectively. The commonest serovar isolated was Salmonella enteritidis in both centers. The NTS isolated were highly sensitive to the antimicrobials tested: ampicillin 98 per cent, chloramphenicol 98 per cent, gentamicin 97 per cent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 98 per cent, and ceftriaxone 100 per cent in UMMC; ampicillin 100 per cent, chloramphenicol 87 per cent, kanamycin 100 per cent, streptomycin 96 per cent, TMP-SMX 93 per cent, and tetracycline 89 per cent in HKB. There were only one and five multi-resistant isolates in UMMC and HKB, respectively. In conclusion, NTS isolated from blood cultures of Malaysian children from Kuala Lumpur and Kota Bharu were highly sensitive to commonly prescribed antibiotics. We speculate that this is due to the restriction of sales of antimicrobials in Malaysia except by prescription. Continuing vigilance and frequent antmicrobial surveillance is necessary."
CD008892,0,19538277,0,Characterization of rickettsial diseases in a hospital-based population in central Tunisia.,"In Tunisia, 2 rickettsial groups, spotted fever group and typhus group, have been described since the beginning of the 20th century. Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), also known as Boutonneuse fever, caused by Rickettsia conorii and transmitted by the dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus, is the most frequent rickettsial infection observed. Its seroprevalence in our region is 9% among blood donors and 23% in hospitalized febrile patients. Typhus group rickettsioses, caused by R. typhi and R. prowazekii, are less frequently reported than in the 1970s. Only sporadic cases of typhus were reported in the last decade. However, R. typhi antibodies were present in 3.6% among healthy people and 40% in patients with acute fever of undetermined origin. In the unit of Infectious Diseases at Farhat Hached University Hospital in Sousse, during 2007, 5% of hospitalized patients had eruptive fever, and half of the cases met clinical criteria of MSF and/or were confirmed by rickettsial serology. The majority of cases (90%) were noted in hot seasons, and contact with domestic animals was found in 76%. The most common symptoms were fever (present in all cases), skin rash (in 85% to 98% of cases), and headache (in 69.5% of cases). The clinical triad (fever + rash +""tache noire"") was noted in 32 to 61%. Normal blood cells or leukopenia, cytolysis, and thrombopenia were the most frequent biological abnormalities. Complications and malignant forms of rickettsial infections were reported in 3.5 to 6% among hospitalized adult patients. When specific serology was performed, MSF was confirmed in 15%, and we noted an emergence of murine typhus (MT) mistaken for R. conorii or viral infection. Rickettsia felis was identified in 1 patient, whereas 17% of cases remained undetermined. Rickettsia conorii Malish was identified by PCR in skin biopsies. Doxycycline was the antibiotic of choice for rickettsial infections; it was prescribed in the majority of patients, associated with fever defervescence, in a mean of 72 hours. The mean length of stay among hospitalized patients with rickettsial infections was 5.9 days. In conclusion, in our region, MSF and murine typhus are endemic. Doxycycline should be prescribed in patients with acute fever and skin rash, especially in hot seasons. These rickettsioses were characterized by benign prognosis. More skin biopsies are needed to identify other SFG rickettsies."
CD008892,0,12018467,0,Salmonella meningitis: report of three cases in adults and literature review.,"Salmonella meningitis is an unusual complication of Salmonella sepsis and occurs almost exclusively in infants and young children. One case of Salmonella meningitis and two cases of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis in adult patients with Salmonella bacteremia were studied and the literature was reviewed. On a retrospective review of the charts of 100 sequential patients with Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi-positive blood cultures, we found one patient with fulminant Salmonella meningitis and two others with CSF pleocytosis. All three patients survived. The patient with Salmonella meningitis had significant residual neurologic sequela. Salmonella encephalopathy occurred in six other patients who presented with headache and were confused or drowsy. Cases of meningitis in adults do occur and are associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Newer cephalosporn antibiotics may be the therapy of choice in these infections."
CD008892,0,1808466,0,Serologic survey of spotted fever group rickettsiosis on Hainan Island of China.,"A serosurvey for antibodies to Rickettsia japonica was conducted on Hainan Island of China. Serum specimens were collected from 1,030 outpatients at hospitals in different parts of the island regardless of their diagnosis. Only two among 538 serum specimens collected in Baoting and Tongshi counties, located in the southern part of the island, were demonstrated to contain antibodies reactive with R. japonica at a high dilution. The specimens also reacted with R. rickettsii at the same titer as with R. japonica. These two specimens reacted with other pathogenic spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae to a lesser extent. On the other hand, the specimens were shown to possess antibodies reactive with R. typhi at a significantly lower dilution or were not reactive at all. The findings suggested the occurrence of an SFG rickettsiosis on Hainan Island. More than half of the serum specimens collected from patients with suspected rickettsial infections in the southern area were found to contain IgM and IgG antibodies to R. typhi, indicating a high incidence of murine typhus."
CD008892,0,2473209,1,A simple adherence test for detection of IgM antibodies in typhoid.,"A simple adherence test to detect IgM antibodies in patients with typhoid is described. The test utilises the IgM-""capture"" approach, in which the test serum is applied to microtitration plate wells previously coated with anti-human IgM, followed by application of a stained Salmonella typhi antigen suspension which shows adherence in positive cases. By this test, 58 (95%) of 61 sera from confirmed cases of typhoid possessed IgM antibodies to the H or O or both antigens of S. typhi. In patients for whom a diagnosis of typhoid was based only on a significant Widal-test titre, 31 (41%) of 76 sera had IgM antibodies to the H or O or both antigens of S. typhi. Some cross-reactivity of the IgM antibodies was detected, especially with the O antigens of S. paratyphi A and B. A total of 82 sera from non-typhoidal fevers (leptospirosis, typhus, dengue fever) showed no reactivity in this test. In normal sera there was no detectable IgM to the O antigen of S. typhi and only a small number (3.9%) had low levels of IgM to the H antigen. The significance and potential importance of this simple, sensitive, specific and economical test is discussed."
CD008892,0,18174137,0,"Type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pOLA52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in Enterobacteriaceae strains.","The conjugative plasmid pOLA52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. Screening of a transposon-mutagenized pOLA52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkABCDF operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. Biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pOLA52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. The conjugative transfer rate of pOLA52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. Through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be expressed as a single operon. Immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (MrkA)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. When transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, pOLA52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pOLA52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3 fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of the plasmid-harbouring strain."
CD008892,0,2404482,0,Pleuropulmonary infections due to nontyphoid strains of Salmonella.,"Medical records of 11 patients with nontyphoid Salmonella pleuropulmonary disease studied from 1960 to 1986 in a general hospital were reviewed. Eight patients (73%) were 60 years old or older, and the median age was in the seventh decade. There was no seasonal variation in the prevalence. The infection was hospital acquired in 4 patients (36%). All patients had one or more (median, 1.5) major underlying diseases. Seven of them had previous abnormalities of the lung or pleura. Severe immunosuppression was present in 7 cases. Pneumonia occurred in 8 patients, lung abscesses in 2, and empyema in 1. All patients with pneumonia had positive blood cultures. A gastrointestinal source of pulmonary infection was not probable because only 2 patients had positive stool cultures. We suggest that the reticulo-endothelial system could be the source of hematogenous spread of nontyphoid Salmonella. The overall mortality was 63%. Pulmonary infection due to Salmonella should be considered among the pathogens associated with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in elderly patients who are immunosuppressed and have underlying pulmonary disease. Pathogenesis of this infection remains to be clarified."
CD008892,0,2099384,0,Biological and immunological characterization of a cloned cholera toxin-like enterotoxin from Salmonella typhimurium.,"A chromosomal DNA fragment, encoding an enterotoxin gene of Salmonella typhimurium Q1, was cloned into bacteriophage EMBL3 and plasmid vector pBR322. The recombinant clones lambda B8 and pC1 were identified using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe made to the B subunit region of the cholera toxin gene (ctx). Cell lysates of Escherichia coli VCS257 [lambda B8] induced fluid secretion in rabbit intestinal loops, while lysates of E. coli DH5 alpha [pC1] failed to elicit an enterotoxic response in this model. Both lysates and partially purified preparations elongated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, elevated cellular cAMP and PGE2, and bound to ganglioside GM1. The biological activity associated with the cloned enterotoxin was neutralized by monospecific antiserum to cholera toxin (CT). Immunoblots of pC1 and lambda B8 lysates probed with anti-CT, exhibited a 30 kDa protein similar to that of pJM17, which carried the ctx gene. Under non-dissociating conditions, anti-CT immunoblots of the same lysates revealed two proteins, one corresponding in size to the holotoxin and the other to CT-A. When analysed by DNA-directed protein synthesis in vitro, both pC1 and lambda B8 DNA expressed two unique proteins (30 and 11 kDa) similar to that of pJM17."
CD008892,0,11237848,0,Typhoid fever and genetic polymorphisms at the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1.,"Control of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) infection in the mouse model of typhoid fever is critically dependent on the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1). In this study, we examined the role of genetic polymorphisms in the human homologue, NRAMP1, in resistance to typhoid fever in southern Vietnam. Patients with blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever and healthy control subjects were genotyped for 6 polymorphic markers within and near NRAMP1 on chromosome 2q35. Four single base-pair polymorphisms (274 C/T, 469+14 G/C, 1465-85 G/A, and D543N), a (GT)(n) repeat in the promoter region of NRAMP1 and D2S1471, and a microsatellite marker approximately 130-kb downstream of NRAMP1 were examined. The allelic and genotypic frequencies for each polymorphism were compared in case patients and control subjects. No allelic association was identified between the NRAMP1 alleles and typhoid fever susceptibility. In addition, neither homozygotes nor heterozygotes for any NRAMP1 variants were at increased risk of typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,7105490,0,Studies of cellular and humoral immunity in typhoid fever and TAB vaccinated subjects.,"An assessment of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to Salmonella typhi antigens in patients with acute typhoid infection, TAB inoculated subjects and in healthy controls is reported. Cell-mediated immunity as assessed by the leucocyte migration inhibition test (LMI), and developed in all cases with typhoid fever. Positive LMI was evident in the first week of the illness and was maintained during the evolution of disease and in some patients was still present after a year. It also developed at the end of 3 weeks in five out of nine TAB vaccinated subjects. Weakly positive LMI was noticed in only two of twenty asian and caucasian controls. Antibodies, determined by the standard Widal test, were significantly raised in both patients with typhoid fever and TAB inoculated subjects. The antibodies and cellular reactivity developed almost simultaneously but there was no correlation between the agglutination titres and LMI positivity, implying that they are independent of each other. Typhoid patients also showed significantly raised serum IgM and IgA levels and increased concentrations of secretory IgA in their saliva."
CD008892,0,20146980,0,[Complications of infected aneurysm due to Salmonella enteritidis: a case report].,"Salmonelloses are becoming more frequented. To date, very few cases of aneurisms or vascular grafts infections have been described. We report the rare case of an extradigestive manifestation, due to Salmonella enteritidis affecting a patient with Behçet disease. The biological diagnosis is based on microorganism isolation from the site of infection but also from blood cultures. The initial treatment combined antibiotherapy and surgical procedure and replacement of the arteriovenous graft."
CD008892,0,1937644,0,Ciprofloxacin in typhoid fever.,"The study covers 78 children with typhoid fever who were hospitalized in April & May 1990. Serious complications were present in 32% (toxemia 22%, ileus 25% and myocarditis 8%). Blood cultures were positive in 30 of 49 tested. Others were diagnosed by positive Widal test. In vitro cultures of S. typhi were resistant to chloramphenicol (90%), ampicillin (93%) and co-trimoxazole (97%). However all were highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin and moderately sensitive to cephalexin and gentamycin. Ciprofloxacin alone or in combination was given in 73 of the 78 children and found to be remarkably effective in controlling the disease and preventing relapse. No serious side effects were noted. The cohort is being followed up for possible long term adverse effects."
CD008892,0,2284499,0,The sequence of the malG gene from Salmonella typhimurium and its functional implications.,"The nucleotide sequence of the malG gene which is essential for maltose transport was determined in Salmonella typhimurium and compared to homologous genes from Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. malG genes from S. typhimurium and E. aerogenes were expressed and their products were active in E. coli. The primary structure of the three MalG proteins was highly conserved. Changes were mainly clustered in a relatively large hydrophilic region of the protein (residues 40 to 75). In contrast, other hydrophilic segments were more conserved, and most remaining changes occurred in the hydrophobic putative transmembrane segments. This suggests that hydrophilic loops in this inner membrane protein may be functionally constrained. These results prove new insights into the functional sites in MalG."
CD008892,0,26201126,0,ROLE OF SALMONELLA SEROLOGY A CENTURY AFTER THE WIDAL ERA.,"Typhoid fever remains an important health burden in the developing world, whereas non-typhoid salmonelloses are one of the most common food-borne illnesses throughout the world and can be subjected to extra-intestinal complications. Culture is the gold standard for diagnosing a Salmonella infection. Serology can also provide evidence of infection. Serological methods for the diagnosis of Salmonella infections in humans and animals vary widely and can as well be used in epidemiologic studies to detect carriers, to assess infection rates, disease burden and vaccine responses. As with all serology, detecting antibody titers in Salmonella infections has its limits, mainly related to low sensitivity and specificity, high running costs, and antibody kinetics and peculiarities. Fast and more or less reliable immunoassays which detect Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi are commercially available. Veterinary and food sectors are well-provided with commercially tests for non-typhoid salmonellosis, while most immunoassays for non-typhoid human Salmonella diagnosis are developed and used in-house mainly for research or surveillance purposes. So far, there is no international consensus for the development of such serological tests for routine diagnostics. 119 years after the observations made by George Fernand Isidore Widal, this work intends to review and analyze the present state of facts and controversies in the field of Salmonella serology."
CD008892,0,6235085,0,Arthritis associated with salmonella infection.,"Six cases of arthritis caused by or associated with Salmonella infection are reported. It is stated that an arthritis associated with a Salmonella infection cannot be excluded on the negative results of the Widal test. Consequent upon Salmonella infection two different types of arthritis might develop: a) monoarticular infectious arthritis or b) a subacute reactive oligo-articular arthritis. In this study a patient with a chronic destructive ""reactive"" oligoarthritis is described, resembling experimental ""Salmonella-associated arthritis"" in rats. This form of arthritis might be regarded as an immune complex mediated disease associated with a chronic infection."
CD008892,0,24094060,0,"Increase in Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A infections in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, January 2011 to August 2013.","We report an increased number of Salmonella enterica Paratyphi A infections in adults in Cambodia. Between January 2011 and August 2013, 71 S. Paratyphi A isolates were recovered from blood cultures, representing a 44-fold increase compared to July 2007 to December 2010, while monthly numbers of cultures did not change. Infections with S.

CD008892,0,15173152,0,"Risk factors for typhoid and paratyphoid fever in Jakarta, Indonesia.","The proportion of paratyphoid fever cases to typhoid fever cases may change due to urbanization and increased dependency on food purchased from street vendors. For containment of paratyphoid a different strategy may be needed than for typhoid, because risk factors for disease may not coincide and current typhoid vaccines do not protect against paratyphoid fever."
CD008892,0,17761477,1,"Serodiagnosis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and S. enterica serovars Paratyphi A, B and C human infections.","The aim of this study was to evaluate an immunoassay for the detection of human serum antibodies to the LPS and flagellar antigens of Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A, B and C, and to the Vi capsular polysaccharide of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi C. A total of 330 sera were used; these originated from 15 patients who were culture-positive for S. Typhi and 15 healthy controls, together with 300 sera submitted to the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens for Salmonella serodiagnosis. By SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting, all 15 sera from culture-positive patients had serum antibodies to the 9,12 LPS antigens and 10 had antibodies to the 'd' flagellar antigens. Of the 300 reference sera, 22 had antibodies to the 9,12 LPS antigens, one to the 1,4,5,12 LPS antigens and 12 to the 6,7 LPS antigens. Only two sera had antibodies to flagellar antigens, one of which bound to the 'b' and the other to the 'd' antigen. An ELISA was developed that successfully detected serum antibodies to the Vi capsular polysaccharides, but because of the kinetics of serum antibody production to the Vi, these antibodies may be of limited value in the serodiagnosis of acute infection with S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi C. The immunoassays described here provide a sensitive means of detecting serum antibodies to the LPS, flagellar and Vi antigens of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi, and constitute a viable replacement for the Widal assay for the screening of sera. The Salmonella serodiagnosis protocols described here are the new standard operating procedures used by the Health Protection Agency's National Salmonella Reference Centre based in the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, Colindale, UK."
CD008892,0,326576,0,A new approach for the solid phase sequence determination of proteins.,Abstract not available
CD008892,0,11230418,1,Serology of typhoid fever in an area of endemicity and its relevance to diagnosis.,"Currently, the laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever is dependent upon either the isolation of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhi from a clinical sample or the detection of raised titers of agglutinating serum antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (O) or flagellum (H) antigens of serotype Typhi (the Widal test). In this study, the serum antibody responses to the LPS and flagellum antigens of serotype Typhi were investigated with individuals from a region of Vietnam in which typhoid is endemic, and their usefulness for the diagnosis of typhoid fever was evaluated. The antibody responses to both antigens were highly variable among individuals infected with serotype Typhi, and elevated antibody titers were also detected in a high proportion of serum samples from healthy subjects from the community. In-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of specific classes of anti-LPS and antiflagellum antibodies were compared with other serologically based tests for the diagnosis of typhoid fever (Widal TO and TH, anti-serotype Typhi immunoglobulin M [IgM] dipstick, and IDeaL TUBEX). At a specificity of > or =0.93, the sensitivities of the different tests were 0.75, 0.55, and 0.52 for the anti-LPS IgM, IgG, and IgA ELISAs, respectively; 0.28 for the antiflagellum IgG ELISA; 0.47 and 0.32 for the Widal TO and TH tests, respectively; and 0.77 for the anti-serotype Typhi IgM dipstick assay. The specificity of the IDeaL TUBEX was below 0.90 (sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.76). The serological assays based on the detection of IgM antibodies against either serotype Typhi LPS (ELISA) or whole bacteria (dipstick) had a significantly higher sensitivity than the Widal TO test when used with a single acute-phase serum sample (P < or = 0.007). These tests could be of use for the diagnosis of typhoid fever in patients who have clinical typhoid fever but are culture negative or in regions where bacterial culturing facilities are not available."
CD008892,0,25362057,0,Pathogenicity of Salmonella strains isolated from egg shells and the layer farm environment in australia.,"In Australia, the egg industry is periodically implicated during outbreaks of Salmonella food poisoning. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and other nontyphoidal Salmonella spp., in particular, are a major concern for Australian public health. Several definitive types of Salmonella Typhimurium strains, but primarily Salmonella Typhimurium definitive type 9 (DT9), have been frequently reported during egg-related food poisoning outbreaks in Australia. The aim of the present study was to generate a pathogenicity profile of nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates obtained from Australian egg farms. To achieve this, we assessed the capacity of Salmonella isolates to cause gastrointestinal disease using both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Data from in vitro experiments demonstrated that the invasion capacity of Salmonella serovars cultured to stationary phase (liquid phase) in LB medium was between 90- and 300-fold higher than bacterial suspensions in normal saline (cultured in solid phase). During the in vivo infection trial, clinical signs of infection and mortality were observed only for mice infected with either 10(3) or 10(5) CFU of S. Typhimurium DT9. No mortality was observed for mice infected with Salmonella serovars with medium or low invasive capacity in Caco-2 cells. Pathogenicity gene profiles were also generated for all serovars included in this study. The majority of serovars tested were positive for selected virulence genes. No relationship between the presence or absence of virulence genes by PCR and either in vitro invasive capacity or in vivo pathogenicity was detected. Our data expand the knowledge of strain-to-strain variation in the pathogenicity of Australian egg industry-related Salmonella spp."
CD008892,0,19124586,0,"Characterization of a monoclonal antibody directed against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and serovar [4,5,12:i:-].","Flagellar extracts of Salmonella enterica serovars expressing phase 2 H1 antigenic complex (H:1,2, H:1,5, H:1,6, and H:1,7) and a mutant flagellin obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the fljB gene from serovar Typhimurium at codon 218, transforming threonine to alanine, expressed in Escherichia coli (fljB218(A)) were used to analyze the H1 antigenic complex. Cross-reactions were detected by Western blotting and dot blotting using commercial polyclonal antibodies against the different wild-type extracts and mutant FljB218(A). Therefore, we produced a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 23D4, isotyped as immunoglobulin M, against H:1,2 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium flagellin. The mutant flagellin was not recognized by this MAb. When a large number of phase 1 and phase 2 flagellin antigens of different serovars were used to characterize the 23D4 MAb, only extracts of serovars Typhimurium and [4,5,12:i:-] reacted. The protein composition of phase 1 and phase 2 extracts and highly purified H:1,2 flagellin from serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 and extract of strain 286 (serovar [4,5,12:i:-]), which reacted with the MAb, was studied. Phase 2 flagellin (FljB(H:1,2)) was detected in phase 1 and phase 2 flagellar heat extracts of serovar Typhimurium and was the single protein identified in all spots of purified H:1,2 flagellin. FliC, FlgK, and other proteins were detected in some immunoreactive spots and in the flagellar extract of serovar [4,5,12:i:-]. Immunoelectron microscopy of complete bacteria with 23D4 showed MAb attachment at the base of flagella, although the MAb failed to recognize the filament of flagella. Nevertheless, the results obtained by the other immunological tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and dot blotting) indicate a reaction against flagellins. The epitopes could also be shared by other proteins on spots where FljB is not present, such as aminopeptidase B, isocitrate lyase, InvE, EF-TuA, enolase, DnaK, and others. In conclusion, MAb 23D4 can be useful for detection and diagnostic purposes of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and serovar [4,5,12:i:-] and could be also helpful for epitope characterization of flagellum-associated antigens."

CD008892,0,15031525,1,Rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of Salmonella serotype typhi antigens in urine.,"We developed and evaluated an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies to capture somatic antigen 9 (O9), flagellar antigen d (Hd), and the Vi capsular polysaccharide antigen (Vi) from the urine of persons with and without typhoid fever. Sequential urine samples were collected from 44 patients with blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever and from two control groups. The first control group included patients with brucellosis (n = 12) and those with clinically diagnosed, non-typhoid, acute, febrile illness (n = 27). The second control group was a sample of healthy volunteer laboratory workers (n = 11). When assessed relative to date of fever onset, sensitivity was highest during the first week for all three antigens: Vi was detected in the urine of nine (100%) patients, O9 in 4 (44%) patients, and Hd in 4 (44%) patients. Sequential testing of two urine samples from the same patient improved test sensitivity. Combined testing for Vi with O9 and Hd produced a trend towards increased sensitivity without compromising specificity. The specificity for Vi exceeded 90% when assessed among both febrile and healthy control subjects, but was only 25% when assessed among patients with brucellosis. Detection of urinary Vi antigen with this ELISA shows promise for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, particularly when used within the first week after fever onset. However, positive reactions for Vi antigen in patients with brucellosis must be understood before urinary Vi antigen detection can be developed further as a useful rapid diagnostic test."
CD008892,0,632343,0,Laboratory and clinical investigation of recovery of Salmonella typhi from blood.,"An experimental study was undertaken of isolation of Salmonella typhi from artificially infected whole blood and blood clot prepared either with small numbers of freshly isolated strains or with the S. typhi Ty2 strain. Results showed that 8 ml of whole blood required a minimum of 50 ml of bile salt broth to dilute the bactericidal effect of the serum. However, the isolation rate for recovery in 210 cases of enteric fever was only 64% when 50 ml of medium was used, as compared to 92% recovery from blood clot from the same group incubated in streptokinase bile salt broth. This probably reflects a very low grade bacteremia in many of the patients. Further investigation showed that, ideally, between 150 and 200 ml of medium is required for satisfactory whole-blood culture. Both the experimental study of artificially infected clots and recovery rates from patients indicate that rapid clot dissolution with streptokinase is preferable to whole-blood culture; this experience has been amply confirmed by almost 5,000 cases over a 20-year period. A 15-ml volume of bile salt broth with 100 U of streptokinase is adequate for the clot from 8 ml of blood, and savings on media and incubator space have considerable cost benefits in developing countries."

The level and dynamics of circulating immune complexes were established with respect to the antigens contained in these complexes. Altogether O- and Vi-antigens were detected in circulating immune complexes, respectively, in 92%, 96% and 94% of cases on weeks 1, 2 and 3 from the beginning of the disease, and in all cases on weeks 4 and 5, the antigens being determined together and separately. Thus, the latent persistence of S. typhi antigens as part of circulating immune complexes in the blood serum was established. The determination of such persistence is of great pathogenetic and diagnostic importance, which also applies to the early period of the disease. The use of such specific and sensitive method as the coagglutination test for this purpose accelerates and facilitates the diagnosis of typhoid fever."

Groups I and III were considered as control and II and IV as treated groups. The latter two groups were treated with onion extract orally. The immunosuppressive effect of onion extract was evaluated by estimating antibody levels by Widal test and hemolysin titer. It was found that mean antibody titers were significantly lower in the treated groups than in controls.

This was a study to prospectively evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the S. typhi using flagellin gene related primers. The study was carried out in the department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh between July, 2010 and June, 2011, including 82 individuals of different age and sex. Of them, 62 were clinically suspected cases of typhoid fever and remaining 20 were apparently healthy controls. Cultures as well as PCR of blood specimens were performed for each of the cases.

The adhesin was found to be a high molecular weight aggregate of the 18-kDa monomer. The dimeric (36 kDa) and tetrameric (76 kDa) forms appeared in sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when a higher concentration of the adhesin was used. The IgGAD (IgG against adhesin) obtained from the immune sera raised in rabbits against purified adhesin could detect all three forms of the adhesin even from the crude fimbrial preparation. The IgGAD failed to recognize the adhesin in the presence of galactose, thereby suggesting the antibody-binding site and the sugar-binding site on the adhesin might be same or overlapping. Furthermore, the IgGAD could localize the adhesin exclusively on the fimbriae as observed in immunogold electron microscopy. The aggregative adherence of the bacteria to HEp-2 cells was reduced to 70% in the presence of the IgGAD. A glycoprotein (34 kDa) present in the membrane fraction of HEp-2 cells interacted with the purified adhesin in a galactose-specific manner. The IgGAD could recognize the adhesin from the crude fimbrial preparation of 9 out of 10 clinical isolates of EAEC strains but failed to identify any protein from the crude fimbrial preparation of Salmonella typhimurium (fim +ve as well as fim -ve strain), Vibrio cholerae (WO7) or Escherichia coli DH5alpha."

After 48 h of incubation in the presence of endotoxin Salmonella typhimurium, IL-1 beta and gamma-IFN levels were measured in the culture supernatants using specific immunodetection assays. Methods of stochastic time series analysis were adopted to evaluate the biochemical data. Our results show the capability of cultured blood cells to produce cytokines upon endotoxin challenge to be at a maximum around the time of sleep onset and during the first hours of sleep, declining during the night to a minimum level in the morning hours. The opposite was observed for cortisol. The analysis of autocorrelation functions gives evidence of a 24-hour rhythm of cortisol and cytokines.

Both the HMW and LMW LPSs were characterized by glycosyl composition and linkage analyses. Immunochemical characterization was performed by Western blotting using factor 9 antiserum and using S. typhimurium antiserum which contains factors 1, 4, 5, and 12(2). In addition, the polysaccharides released by mild acid hydrolysis were isolated and subjected to hydrolysis by bacteriophage P22, which contains endorhamnosidase activity. The resulting oligosaccharides were purified by using Bio-Gel P4 gel permeation chromatography and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), tandem MS-MS, and matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight MS. The results show that the HMW LPS O-antigen polysaccharides from both isolates are comprised of two different repeating units, -[-->2)-[alpha-Tyvp-(1-->3)]beta-D-Manp-(1-->4)-alpha-L-R hap-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->]- (structure I) and [-->2)-[alpha-Tyvp-(1-->3)]beta-D-Manp-(1-->4)-alpha--L-R hap-(1-->3)-[alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->4)]alpha-D-Galp-(1-->]- (structure II). The LMW LPSs from both isolates contains truncated O-antigen polysaccharide which is comprised of only structure I. In the virulent SE6-E21 isolate, the HMW LPS has a structure I/II ratio of 1:1, while in the avirulent SE6-E5 isolate, this ratio is 7:1. While the 7:1 ratio represents the published level of glucosylation for S. enteritidis LPS as well as for S. enteritidis LPS purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., the 1:1 ratio found for the virulent SE6-E21 is identical to the high level of glucosylation reported for S. typhi LPS. Thus, the LPS from the virulent SE6-E21 isolate produces an S. typhi-like LPS. Furthermore, the amount of O-antigen polysaccharide in SE6-E21 was twice that in SE6-E5."

CD008892,0,8932986,0,A semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method for measurement of MRNA for TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in whole blood cultures: its application in typhoid fever and exentric exercise.,"Whole blood cultures are used to study cytokine stimulation and release ex vivo. In the present study this method was compared with a more direct approach and a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to assess mRNA expression for IL-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and mRNA in whole blood. Stimulation of whole blood from normal donors with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at various time intervals showed a parallel rise of immunogenic IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha as well as a rise of mRNA expression for IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha with peak levels for IL-1 beta after 4-6 h stimulation and for mRNA TNF-alpha expression after 2 h stimulation. These methods were used to explore cytokine production during the course of typhoid fever and after a 5 km run. In both conditions circulating cytokine concentrations were not influenced, but the TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA gene expression in circulating whole blood cells was increased in patients with typhoid fever. The LPS-stimulated production of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was decreased in both but there was no change for the mRNA content in whole blood for these cytokines. These findings demonstrate that RT-PCR is an attractive method to study the gene expression of cytokines in whole blood, an increased TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta gene expression is present in typhoid fever, and that the LPS stimulated downregulation of cytokines in exercise and typhoid fever may be mediated by post-transcriptional processes."
CD008892,0,9018985,0,Prevalence of multi-drug resistant Salmonella typhi in Ludhiana Punjab.,A total of 945 strains of S. typhi isolated from blood cultures during 1989 to 1994 were studied. Their antibiotic susceptibility showed 580 (61.4%) of strains to be multidrug resistant. The 464 strains tested for their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were all sensitive to the drug. Twenty three (17.9%) of the 128 strains of S. paratyphi A were resistant to chloramphenicol. The sole isolate of S. paratyphi B was sensitive to all antibiotics tested.
CD008892,0,11570190,0,Sequence polymorphism of the Salmonella plasmid virulence factor D (SpvD) in Salmonella enterica isolates of animal origin.,"The nucleotide sequence encoding the Salmonella plasmid virulence factor D (SpvD) was determined in 17 Salmonella strains that were different in O and H antigen patterns, animal host and geographical origin, and year of isolation. Nucleotide sequence comparison revealed the existence of at least nine spvD alleles resulting in 8 SpvD protein variants although the nucleotide sequences were highly similar (identity 98.8-100%). The spvD gene products differed from each other in up to 4 amino acid residues only with the exception of the carboxy-terminally truncated SpvD variant of one S. Gallinarum field isolate. The highly conserved primary structure of SpvD in epidemiologically relevant salmonellae suggests that this virulence factor is a promising antigen candidate for diagnostic purposes (i.e. antibody detection in infected animals) but also for immunoprophylaxis in farm animal species."

CD008892,0,9231214,0,Short courses of ofloxacin for the treatment of enteric fever.,"Typhoid fever continues to be a major public health problem in tropical countries, exacerbated in recent years by the spread of multi-drug resistant strains of Salmonella typhi. Short treatment courses of fluoroquinolones are effective, and have the advantage of reduced cost and increased compliance, but the optimal length of treatment is unknown. In an open, randomized comparison, 107 adults with uncomplicated enteric fever (95 of whom had positive blood cultures for S. typhi and 5 for S. paratyphi) were treated with oral ofloxacin, 15 mg/kg/d for 2 d or 10 mg/kg/d for 3 d. Mean fever clearance times were the same in the 2 treatment groups (97 h). There were 7 treatment failures, one in the 2 d group and 6 in the 3 d group (P = 0.07). Three of the 5 patients infected with nalidixic acid resistant strains of S. typhi had treatment failures, compared with 4 of 90 with nalidixic acid sensitive isolates (P < 0.0001; relative risk 13.5, 95% confidence interval 4.1-43%). Treatment with ofloxacin for 2 or 3 d is equally effective in adults with uncomplicated enteric fever caused by nalidixic acid sensitive strains of S. typhi. The epidemiology and management of nalidixic acid resistent typhoid needs further investigation."

CD008892,0,9491679,0,Haemagglutination system for the simultaneous detection of LPS and anti LPS antibodies of S.typhi.,"In view of the limitations of Widal test for the diagnosis of typhoid, haemagglutination test using sensitized sheep red blood cells was designed at our laboratory. The test gave only 1.8% positivity at 1:40 dilution among 500 normal persons. Eighteen of the 30 culture proven cases gave the HA test positive while the positivity was 62.5% among suspected cases of typhoid. Thus, the anti LPS haemagglutination test showed a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 98.2%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 66.66% and 96.7% respectively. The haemagglutination inhibition test was also developed for the detection of LPS antigen of S. typhi in the serum samples of typhoid cases and could detect 1.5625 micrograms/ mL of S. typhi LPS antigen but failed to detect LPS in the sera of bacteriologically proven cases of typhoid. However, it could detect the growth of simulated blood cultures of S. typhi within one hour of inoculation and did not give any cross reactions with other bacterial cultures. The data suggest that the haemagglutination test could be a good adjunct for Widal test and the haemagglutination inhibition test could help the early detection of S. typhi in culture."
CD008892,0,10348767,0,Azithromycin versus ciprofloxacin for treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever in a randomized trial in Egypt that included patients with multidrug resistance.,"To compare clinical and bacteriological efficacies of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin for typhoid fever, 123 adults with fever and signs of uncomplicated typhoid fever were entered into a randomized trial. Cultures of blood were positive for Salmonella typhi in 59 patients and for S. paratyphi A in 3 cases; stool cultures were positive for S. typhi in 11 cases and for S. paratyphi A in 1 case. Multiple-drug resistance (MDR; resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) was present in isolates of 21 of 64 patients with positive cultures. Of these 64 patients, 36 received 1 g of azithromycin orally once on the first day, followed by 500 mg given orally once daily on the next 6 days; 28 patients received 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally twice daily for 7 days. Blood cultures were repeated on days 4 and 10 after the start of therapy, and stool cultures were done on days 4, 10, and 28 after the start of therapy. All patients in both groups improved during therapy and were cured. Defervescence (maximum daily temperatures of </=38 degrees C) occurred at the following times [mean +/- standard deviation (range)] after the start of therapy: 3.8 +/- 1.1 (2 to 7) days with azithromycin and 3.3 +/- 1.0 (1 to 5) days with ciprofloxacin. No relapses were detected. Cultures of blood and stool during and after therapy were negative in all cases, except for one patient treated with azithromycin who had a positive blood culture on day 4. These results indicated that azithromycin and ciprofloxacin were similarly effective, both clinically and bacteriologically, against typhoid fever caused by both sensitive organisms and MDR S. typhi."

CD008892,0,17350203,1,Rapid detection of early typhoid fever in endemic community children by the TUBEX O9-antibody test.,"Typhoid remains a global public health problem, and quick accurate immunodiagnosis is needed. Here, we examined the performance of the 5-min TUBEX O9-antibody detection kit in 243 outpatients (mostly children and infants) in their first week of fever and 57 healthy subjects in the Bangladesh community. Based on culture results, TUBEX was 91.2% (31/34) sensitive and 82.3% (172/209) specific in febrile subjects. However, specificity was better in nonfebrile healthy subjects (89.5%, 51/57) or in febrile individuals who serologically had dengue fever (90.5%, 57/63), suggesting that some culture-negative febrile individuals could be truly typhoidal. These individuals were also positive in an anti-crude O9 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the Widal test. Regression analysis of the TUBEX and ELISA results showed good concordance between them, better with the combined IgM-IgG ELISA than with IgM alone, suggesting that TUBEX detects IgM antibodies not necessarily by themselves, as previously reported, but with the help of IgG antibodies."
CD008892,0,21908327,0,Evaluation of an immunochromatographic assay for rapid detection of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis.,"An immunochromatographic assay was developed to detect Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis in a single strip. The assay was constructed in the form of a sandwich, using 2 specific anti-S. Typhimurium and anti-S. Enteritidis antibodies immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane at separated test lines, while the other specific antibody to Salmonella spp. was conjugated with gold nanoparticles. The test strips can immediately detect S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis specifically in a culture medium at levels as low as 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml, respectively. The contamination of S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis at 1 cfu/ml or greater can be detected by the test strips after 6-24 hr incubation. The specificities of the test strips to detect S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis, in spiked samples, were obtained at 100%; the sensitivities were at 98.89% (89/90) and 87.50% (70/80), respectively, compared with the conventional method. The newly developed multiplex immunochromatographic assay is the first report on the efficient detection of both S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis simultaneously in single strip. This test strip also provides advantages of simplicity and very rapid detection of these specific bacterial contaminants in chicken and can be useful for mass detection on chicken farms and in other veterinary products."

Clinical and therapeutic data, and course in 68 patients].","Between 1982 and 1989, a retrospective study on non typhi Salmonella bacteremias was performed among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus hospitalized in 4 departments of Infectious and Tropical Diseases in Paris. The population included 59 men and 9 women; 26.4 percent had been contamined with HIV by heterosexual contact; 17.6 percent originated from Africa or Haiti. Clinical symptoms were fever (100 percent of the cases), present since less than 5 days (65 percent of the cases), and gastrointestinal symptoms, present in 53 percent of the patients. Blood cultures were positive in all cases; Salmonella was less frequently found in other sites: stools (n = 13, 19 percent), urine (n = 5), lymph nodes (n = 1), sputum (n = 1). Mean CD4 cell count was 118 +/- 145/mm3. The serotypes were mainly S. typhimurium (n = 26), S. enteritidis (n = 23), and S. dublin (n = 15). Under antibiotic therapy, the course of the disease was initially favorable in 98.5 percent of the cases. One patient died of septic shock. At least one relapse occurred in 17 percent of the patients, 2.1 +/- 1.6 months after the end of the initial therapy. No relapse was observed in patients taking zidovudine or antibioprophylaxis, but 53 percent of the patients without antibioprophylaxis relapsed (P less than 0.001). The overall survival of the cohort was 25 percent after 18 months. These results show the poor prognosis of a first episode of Salmonella bacteremia in HIV infected patients, making the diagnosis of AIDS highly probable if cellular immunity is markedly impaired."

We present the case of a previously healthy 36-y-old female who suffered fever, chills, epigastralgia and progressive jaundice for 3 d, with acute acalculous cholecystitis subsequently diagnosed. In addition to antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone, open cholecystectomy was performed. However, bile and blood culture both showed Salmonella typhi growth unexpectedly, and ileocolitis was revealed by colonoscopy. Careful tracing of the history of the patient recalled a history of travel to Indonesia. In adults without common risk factors for acalculous cholecystitis, a detailed history including travel to endemic areas and high index of suspicion for typhoidal acute acalculous cholecystitis are important, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy for covering Salmonella typhi should be considered."

The diagnosis was made by isolating the organisms from the blood. The Widal test could not be used as a diagnostic criterion. By means of chemotherapy with chloramphenicol (initial dose 30-40 mg/kg body weight) defervescence was achieved within an average of 4.5 days. The course of the disease was generally mild; one patient with typhoid fever died. The average hospital stay was 19 days. Four patients of the typhoid fever group were readmitted with a relapse. The laboratory examinations included blood clot culture, phage typing, Widal test, haemoglobin, leucocyte count, transaminases, serum bilirubin, and routine examination and culture of stool and urine.

Currently, there is limited information on the level of contamination with zoonotic pathogens related to the laying hen housing system. Therefore, 2 studies were designed to investigate the effect of the housing system on colonization of layers with Salmonella. In both studies, layers were housed in 3 different housing systems: a conventional cage system, a furnished cage, and an aviary. At 18 wk of age, all birds were orally inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis. Shedding and colonization were measured at regular time points. The results did not show an increased risk for alternative housing systems compared with the conventional battery cage system. In contrast, in one study, a faster decline in shedding was noted for layers housed in the alternative cage systems in comparison with the conventional cage system. This study does not give indications that housing layers in alternative systems will yield a risk for increased Salmonella contamination."
CD008892,0,11523761,0,Serum C-reactive protein concentrations in Malaysian children with enteric fever.,"To investigate the role of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in the diagnosis of typhoid fever, we studied 227 febrile Malaysian children hospitalized during a 12-month period. The children were: culture-positive for Salmonella typhi (Group 1; n = 108); culture-negative but with typical clinical features of typhoid fever (Group 2; n = 60); or had non-typhoidal illness (Group 3; n = 59). Group 1 children had the highest serum CRP concentrations (geometric mean [SD range]; 43 [12-150] mg/l vs. 26 [8-85] mg/l in Group 2 and 21 [4-110] mg/l in Group 3; p < 0.001). In regression analysis, age, patient group and fever duration were independently associated with serum CRP (p < 0.05) but gender was not. In Group 1 patients, there was a significant positive association between serum CRP and Widal O and H agglutinin titres. In receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis of serum CRP for Groups 1 and 2 combined, compared with Group 3, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.65. These data show that the serum CRP is highest in culture-positive children with enteric fever and reflects the immune response to the infection in this group. Nevertheless, serum CRP had relatively low sensitivity and specificity for confirmed or clinically diagnosed typhoid fever (68 and 58 per cent, respectively at 'cut-off' concentration 30.0 mg/l), and an AUC value only moderately above that associated with no predictive power (0.5). Although of limited use as a primary diagnostic test, a raised serum CRP may still have a place as one of a range of features that facilitate assessment of a febrile child in a typhoid-endemic area."
CD008892,0,10473651,0,Induction of genetic damage in human lymphocytes and mutations in Salmonella by trihalomethanes: role of red blood cells and GSTT1-1 polymorphism.,"The brominated trihalomethanes (THMs) are mutagenic and carcinogenic disinfection by-products frequently found in chlorinated drinking water. They can be activated to mutagens by the product of the glutathione S-transferase-Theta (GSTT1++-1) gene in Salmonella RSJ100, which has been transfected with this gene. To evaluate this phenomenon in humans, we have examined the genotoxicity of a brominated THM, bromoform (BF), using the Comet assay in human whole blood cultures exposed in vitro. No differences were found in the comet tail length between cultures from GSTT1-1(+) versus GSTT1-1(-) individuals (1.67 +/- 0.40 and 0.74 +/- 0.54 microm/mM, respectively, P = 0.28). The high variability was due to the relatively weak induction of comets by BF. Combining the data from both genotypic groups, the genotoxic potency of BF was 1.20 +/- 0.34 microm/mM (P = 0.003). GSTT1-1 is expressed in red blood cells but not in the target cells (lymphocytes), and expression within the target cell (as in Salmonella RSJ100) may be necessary for enhanced mutagenesis in GSTT1-1(+) relative to GSTT1-1(-) cultures. To examine this, we exposed Salmonella RSJ100 and a control strain not expressing the gene (TPT100) to the most mutagenic brominated THM detected in Salmonella, dibromochloromethane (DBCM), either in the presence or absence of S9 or red blood cells from GSTT1-1(+) or GSTT1-1(-) individuals. S9 did not activate DBCM in the non-expressing strain TPT100, and it did not affect the ability of the expressing strain RSJ100 to activate DBCM. As with S9, red cells from either genotypic group were unable to activate DBCM in TPT100. However, red cells (whole or lysed) from both genotypic groups completely repressed the ability of the expressing strain RSJ100 to activate DBCM to a mutagen. Such results suggest a model in which exposure to brominated THMs may pose an excess genotoxic risk in GSTT1-1(+) individuals to those organs and tissues that both express this gene and come into direct contact with the brominated THM, such as the colon. In contrast, those organs to which brominated THMs would be transported via the blood might be protected by erythrocytes. Such a proposal is reasonably consistent with the organ specificity of drinking water-associated cancer in humans, which shows slightly elevated risks for cancer of the colon and bladder but not of the liver."

To diagnose systemic penicilliosis, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based antibody test with Mp1p, a purified recombinant antigenic mannoprotein of P. marneffei. Evaluation of the test with guinea pig sera against P. marneffei and other pathogenic fungi indicated that this assay was specific for P. marneffei. Clinical evaluation revealed that high levels of specific antibody were detected in two immunocompetent penicilliosis patients. Furthermore, approximately 80% (14 of 17) of the documented penicilliosis patients with human immunodeficiency virus tested positive for the specific antibody. No false-positive results were found for serum samples from 90 healthy blood donors, 20 patients with typhoid fever, and 55 patients with tuberculosis, indicating a high specificity of the test. Thus, this ELISA-based test for the detection of anti-Mp1p antibody can be of significant value as a diagnostic for penicilliosis."

Cryostat cut sections of rodent liver or Hep2 cell nuclei have been used as substrate in the test but are often difficult to arrange in laboratories in developing countries. Hence, a modification was developed using smears from rat liver suspensions. The smears were compared with the cryostat cut sections over 338 sera samples of suspected cases of collagen diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disorders, hepatitis B, enteric fever, tuberculosis and normal subjects. The sera from suspected collagen diseases cases were also compared with ANA test using Hep2 cells. The modified smear technique was well comparable and the clarity of the immunofluorescence was even better than for cryostat cut sections. Using the modified smear technique 272 sera out of 2,851 sera gave positive test for ANA. The homogenous, speckled and peripheral patterns were seen for 203, 66 and 3 samples respectively. To conclude: The smears prepared from homogenised rat liver suspension and fixed like bacterial smears offer a very convenient and reliable tissue substrate for ANA test."

Most probable number (MPN) analysis showed that 56.7% of the samples (34/60) were in violation of the limit of allowable coliform bacteria in chicken meat, for which the maximum is 46,000 MPN/g. Multidrug-resistant phenotypes of both S. enterica and E. coli were found. The presence of class 1 integrons was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and dot-blot hybridization. PCR showed that class 1 integrons were present in 42.9% (6/14) and 37.7% (40/106) of S. enterica and E. coli isolates, respectively. Resistance genes identified in this study were aadA2, aadA4, aadA22, and aadA23 (for aminoglycoside resistance); dfrA5 (for trimethoprim resistance), and lnuF (for lincosamide resistance). Four S. enterica isolates underwent multilocus sequence typing and the results were sequence type (ST) 50, ST 96, ST 1543, and ST 1549, which matched well with strains from many countries and reflected an international spread.

In order to define immunodominant proteins within the S. Typhi membrane preparation used as antigen in these prior studies and to identify potential biomarkers unique to S. Typhi bacteremic patients, we probed microarrays containing 2,724 S. Typhi proteins with ALS collected at the time of clinical presentation from 10 Bangladeshis with acute typhoid fever. We identified 62 immunoreactive antigens when evaluating both the IgG and IgA responses. Immune responses to 10 of these antigens discriminated between individuals with acute typhoid infection and healthy control individuals from areas where typhoid infection is endemic, as well as Bangladeshi patients presenting with fever who were subsequently confirmed to have a nontyphoid illness. Using an ALS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format and purified antigen, we then confirmed that immune responses against the antigen with the highest immunoreactivity (hemolysin E [HlyE]) correctly identified individuals with acute typhoid or paratyphoid fever in Dhaka, Bangladesh. These observations suggest that purified antigens could be used with ALS and corresponding acute-phase activated B lymphocytes in diagnostic platforms to identify acutely infected patients, even in areas where enteric fever is endemic."

Hybrids secreting MAbs specific for P. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, S. krefeld, S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the six specific clones, clone 5F8, which was IgM-producing and which reacted with all 56 P. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. Results obtained from the indirect ELISA against various P. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5F8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. The antibody could be readily used to identify P. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. The antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect ELISA that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis."

CD008892,0,23413992,0,Rapid diagnostic tests for non-malarial febrile illness in the tropics.,"The recent roll-out of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria has highlighted the decreasing proportion of malaria-attributable illness in endemic areas. Unfortunately, once malaria is excluded, there are few accessible diagnostic tools to guide the management of severe febrile illnesses in low resource settings. This review summarizes the current state of RDT development for several key infections, including dengue fever, enteric fever, leptospirosis, brucellosis, visceral leishmaniasis and human African trypanosomiasis, and highlights many remaining gaps. Most RDTs for non-malarial tropical infections currently rely on the detection of host antibodies against a single infectious agent. The sensitivity and specificity of host-antibody detection tests are both inherently limited. Moreover, prolonged antibody responses to many infections preclude the use of most serological RDTs for monitoring response to treatment and/or for diagnosing relapse. Considering these limitations, there is a pressing need for sensitive pathogen-detection-based RDTs, as have been successfully developed for malaria and dengue. Ultimately, integration of RDTs into a validated syndromic approach to tropical fevers is urgently needed. Related research priorities are to define the evolving epidemiology of fever in the tropics, and to determine how combinations of RDTs could be best used to improve the management of severe and treatable infections requiring specific therapy."
CD008892,0,2126447,0,Use of detergents in the preparation of Salmonella samples for enzyme immunoassay on polymyxin-coated polyester cloth.,Heating Salmonella cells in the presence of detergents such as deoxycholate or Triton x-100 greatly increased the sensitivity of an enzyme immunoassay for lipopolysaccharide antigens using polymyxin-coated polyester cloth as the solid phase for antigen capture. The presence of a 100-fold excess of E. coli lipopolysaccharide in the test sample did not affect the detection of the Salmonella lipopolysaccharide. The sensitivity of the assay using deoxycholate-heat treatment of the antigens followed by detection on polymyxin-coated cloth was equivalent to that of an assay using antibody-coated polyester cloth for antigen capture.
CD008892,0,17374897,0,Clinical and microbiological investigations of typhoid fever in an infectious disease hospital in Kuwait.,"A retrospective analysis of 135 typhoid cases was conducted to review the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of enteric fever cases diagnosed and treated at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Kuwait, from 2002 to 2005. Diagnosis of patients was based on clinical features, serology and blood culture. The susceptibility testing of the isolates to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid was performed by the disc diffusion method, and MICs of ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were determined by Etest. Of 135 typhoid fever patients, 108 (88 %) were treated with ceftriaxone and 27 (20 %) were treated with ciprofloxacin. The mean time for fever defervescence with ciprofloxacin therapy was 8 days and 6.3 days for those treated with ceftriaxone. Of the 135 Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A isolated from patients, 50 (37 %) were multidrug resistant (MDR) and 94 (69.6 %) isolates of both serotypes were nalidixic acid resistant (NAR). Between 90 and 100 % of MDR and NAR strains had decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (0.125-1 microg ml(-1)). Low-level resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC 0.125-1 microg ml(-1)) was also detected in 13.8 and 33.3 % of nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Two relapses occurred in the ciprofloxacin-treated group. MDR strains and strains resistant to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone are a major threat in the developing world. A situation is fast approaching where the emergence of highly resistant Salmonella isolates is quite likely. Proper steps must be taken to avoid a pandemic spread of MDR S. Typhi strains."

In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of serum IgG and IgM antibodies to protein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens of Salmonella typhi which was compared with the Widal test in various groups of subjects. In typhoid patients with hemocultures positive for S. typhi (TP group), ELISA positivity was found on 100% for IgG antiprotein, 94.44% for IgG anti-LPS and 88.89% for IgM to both the protein and LPS antigens. In contrast, the Widal test was positive in only 61.11% for anti-O and 83.33% for anti-H antibodies. In healthy control subjects (HC group), only 5% of serum samples were positive for IgG anti-protein and none was positive for IgG anti-LPS or IgM to either the protein or LPS. In contrast, the Widal test was positive in 7.5% of HC group for anti-O and 17.5% for anti-H antibodies. In blood bank donors (BB group), both ELISA and Widal tests were positive in 23-40% of sera. Since the hospital records of BB group were incomplete. It might be possible that some of these subjects had recently been infected with S. typhi. Our data indicate that the standard Widal test was associated with false negative reactions in 16-39% of blood culture positive subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008892,0,11574576,0,Rapid identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolated from blood: implications for therapy.,"The turnaround time (TAT) for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi identification and reporting of the antibiotic susceptibility profile was determined for 391 cases of typhoid fever, using the lysis direct plating or lysis centrifugation method of blood culture along with rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The TAT was more rapid (TAT for 90% of the patients [TAT(90)] = 30 h; TAT(100) </= 67 h) than was possible with conventional methodologies and was equivalent to that reported previously using more advanced, costly technologies that are largely unavailable in developing countries. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles, determined by the rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing method, of randomly selected 60 S. enterica serovar Typhi isolates were identical to those determined by overnight conventional testing. Preliminary assessment of the impact of the reduced TAT on physician practices revealed that initial empirical therapy was prescribed at the time of presentation in most cases (87 of 108 [81%]) despite awareness that the final report would be available on the following day. Patients treated empirically with first-line antibiotics and shown subsequently to be infected with a multidrug-resistant strain benefited most (8 cases), since therapy was changed appropriately on the following day. In an additional 21 cases, therapy with an appropriate antibiotic was initiated after culture results were available. Thus, in approximately one-fourth (29 of 108 [27%]) of the cases, a change in management to an agent active for treatment of the isolate was made after receipt of the test results. However, in no case was therapy changed from a second-line to a first-line agent, even if the isolate was reported on the day after presentation to be sensitive to first-line therapy (33 cases). Ways in which to utilize rapid-TAT result reporting in order to positively influence physicians' prescribing in Bangladesh are the subject of ongoing research."
CD008892,0,21804509,0,Effectiveness of levofloxacin in enteric fever.,"This intervention study was conducted to determine the efficacy of Levofloxacin in the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever. Among 100 patients, who were purposively selected for the study had presented sign and symptoms of enteric fever with blood culture positive salmonella in laboratory findings during the admission in the department of Medicine, Uttara Adhunik Medical College & Hospital, Dhaka. Patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups. One group was treated with oral levofloxacin 750mg once daily (OD) and another was injected with Levofloxacin 500mg once daily for 7 days. All the patients were examined twice daily to observe the clinical cure or failure of levofloxacin. Study was conducted from January 2008 to December 2008. Statistical analysis was performed by using statistical software SPSS version 12. Among the 100 patients in the study, majority of them 46(92%) were aged between 15 to 25 years, the next group was between 25 to 35 years 26(52%) and only three patients were aged above 65 years. Significant number of the patients were male (67), and the rest of them were female. The patients were clinically examined specially for anaemia, jaundice, caecal gurgling, hepatosplenomegaly in both the groups and the relevant investigations were performed. It was found that 46 patients in group A, who took oral levofloxacin, were cured after seven days, whereas 48 patients in group B were fully cured by taking injectable levofloxacin by seven days. In this study, levofloxacin was found to be the most effective drug in both oral and injectable form in one-week treatment of uncomplicated typhoid."
CD008892,0,23022040,0,Severe febrile illness in adult hospital admissions in Tanzania: a prospective study in an area of high malaria transmission.,"Severe febrile illness is a major cause of adult hospital admission in Africa. Studies of non-malarial fever come largely from children or from high HIV prevalence settings. This prospective study of adult admissions with severe febrile illness in a malaria-endemic area with moderate/low HIV prevalence investigated admission diagnosis as well as final diagnosis based on results of investigations. Severe malaria was the admission diagnosis in 148/198 (74.7%) cases. Plasmodium falciparum was identified in 38/188 (20.2%) admissions and 26/198 (13.1%) were bacteraemic, with 13/25 (52%) prescribed empirical antibiotics. HIV was equally common among those with (16/37; 43.2%) and without P. falciparum (50/138; 36.2%) (p=0.44). In 6/22 (27.3%) deaths, blood cultures were positive for a pathogen, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and non-Typhi Salmonella predominating. Chest radiography was suspicious for bacterial/mycobacterial disease in 5/22 additional deaths. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were more sensitive but less specific than WHO severe malaria criteria for predicting mortality. Malaria is overdiagnosed in adults with severe febrile illness and was not associated with mortality in the absence of co-infection in this high-incidence setting. Adults with severe febrile illness should be tested for malaria and HIV using rapid, sensitive tests. Early antibiotic use should be promoted. Improved diagnostics for invasive bacterial disease are needed."

Six patients were males and the most frequent findings were: high fever, poor physical condition, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, dehydration, meteorism, liver and spleen enlargement, cough, bleeding disorders and central nervous system abnormalities which were suggestive of sepsis. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed in all patients through the isolation of Salmonella typhi in blood cultures. The Widal reaction showed higher than 1/160 ""O"" and ""H"" agglutinin titers in five out of six patients in which it was performed. Neutrophilia was observed in all cases, with a shift to the left in five of them. Anemia was present in all of them. The following complications were found: hepatitis (1 case), hepatitis and meningitis (1 case), bronchopneumonia (1 case), and bleeding abnormalities (4 cases).

CD008892,0,12757221,1,Antibody response in typhoid fever in endemic Indonesia and the relevance of serology and culture to diagnosis.,"Culture and serology were performed on blood and serum samples collected at or shortly after admission from 473 patients presented with suspected clinical typhoid. Clinical symptoms at first presentation including confusion, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, abdominal pain, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding were non-specific as they were observed even more often in non-typhoid patients. Culture confirmed the diagnosis in 65.3% of the patients with typhoid fever as the final diagnosis. The sensitivity (58%) and specificity (98.1%) of a rapid dipstick assay for the detection of S. typhi-specific immunoglobulin M were somewhat lower than those of culture but higher than those of the Widal test. The dipstick assay thus may well be used in the serodiagnosis of typhoid in situation where culture facilities are not available. Combination of test results of dipstick and culture improved sensitivity to 82.5%. In laboratories that perform blood culture the dipstick assay may be used as a rapid screening tests to facilitate a rapid diagnosis. Sensitivity of the dipstick assay strongly increased with duration of illness and was higher for culture positive than for culture negative patients. Duration of illness, and different pathogen and host factors including dose of infection, pathogenicity and antigenicity, and prior antibiotic use are likely to influence the immune response, therefore the result of the dipstick assay. Duration of illness and presence of S. typhi in the blood are major factors that determine severity of disease."

Children aged one month to 12 years who had fever for five days or more and who did not receive antibiotics within the first 48 hours irrespective of the diagnosis were included in this study. A total of 120 patients fulfilled the criteria. Bacteria could be isolated from 65 cases (54.2%). The commonest organism isolated was Salmonella typhi (43.1%). Others included Escherichia coli (12.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.7%); Streptococcus, Shigella, Diplococcus, Klebsiella and Acinetobacter were also isolated. The Salmonella typhi were resistant to conventional antibiotics (ampicillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole); however, they were sensitive to amikacin, netilmicin, nalidixic acid, and cephalothin. A cluster of enteric fever cases from Mingalartaungnyunt township was noticed and was reported to the Directorate of Health. Changes in the incidence and etiology of bacteremia in hospitals are well documented. Sentinel surveys of bacteremia in major hospitals should be carried out in order to detect the changing patterns of bacteremia and antibiotic sensitivity; such surveys will be of great help in establishing local antibiotic policies."

CD008892,0,1723500,0,Repair of cytotoxic lesions induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli.,"The role of nucleotide excision repair and 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases in removing cytotoxic lesions induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli cells was examined. Compared to the E. coli wild-type strain, the S. typhimurium wild-type strain was more sensitive to the same dose of MNNG. Nucleotide excision repair in both bacterial species does not contribute significantly to the survival after MNNG treatment, indicating that the observed differences in survival between S. typhimurium and E. coli should be attributed to DNA-repair systems other than nucleotide excision repair. The survival of the E. coli alkA mutant strain is seriously affected by the lack of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II, accentuating the importance of this DNA-repair enzyme in protecting E. coli cells against the lethal effects of methylating agents. Following indications from our experiments, the existence of an alkA gene analogue in S. typhimurium has been questioned. Dot-blot hybridisation, using the E. coli alkA gene as a probe, was performed, and such a nucleotide sequence was not detected on S. typhimurium genomic DNA. The existence of constitutive 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, analogous to the E. coli Tag gene product in S. typhimurium cells, suggested by the results is discussed."

Etiologic agents were identified in a case-control study: cases were HIV-infected patients with diarrhea (HIV+ D+) and HIV seronegative patients with diarrhea (HIV- D+); controls were HIV-infected patients without diarrhea (HIV+ D-) and seronegative controls without diarrhea (HIV- D-). Strict enteric pathogens were identified by conventional methods. Different E. coli pathotypes were characterized by PCR. Opportunistic parasites such as Cryptosporidium and Microsporidium were identified by the Kinyoun method and trichromic stain of Weber respectively. Rotaviruses were identified with a commercial latex agglutination kit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method. A total of 594 patients were examined (158 HIV+D+, 121 HIV- D+, 160 HIV+ D- and 155 HIV- D-). In immunocompetent adults the main causes of diarrhea were: Shigella sp.

CD008892,0,17698569,0,Lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella enterica activates NF-kappaB through both classical and alternative pathways in primary B Lymphocytes.,"Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are potent polyclonal B-lymphocyte activators. Recently, we have shown that LPS inhibits both spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis in mature B lymphocytes, through cytosolic retention of Bax, a proapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, by preventing its translocation to mitochondria. Research within the last few years has revealed that members of the NF-kappaB transcription factor regulate cell viability by activating genes involved in mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. In this report, we examined the effect of sustained LPS stimulation on cytosolic and nuclear proteins of the IkappaB/NF-kappaB family to determine which NF-kappaB pathway, canonical (classical) or noncanonical (alternative), is activated by this agent in mature B cells. Immunoblotting analyses showed that LPS induced a time-dependent degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitors IkappaBbeta and IkappaBepsilon (preferentially to isoform IkappaBalpha), via IkappaB kinase beta. In addition, we observed that LPS triggered the processing of NF-kappaB p105 to p50 and that of NF-kappaB p100 to p52 in parallel with nuclear translocation of active p50 and p52, as NF-kappaBp50/RelA and NF-kappaBp52/RelB heterodimers, respectively. These results suggest that sustained stimulation with LPS can activate NF-kappaB through both classical and alternative pathways."
CD008892,0,543814,0,The role of cell-mediated immunity in typhoid.,"The cell-mediated immunity in typhoid was assessed by the leukocyte migration inhibition test and delayed hypersensitivity skin test in 60 clinical typhoid patients.

This metabolic activation pathway is not detected in standard in-vitro mutagenicity test systems. We describe the construction of Salmonella typhimurium TA1538-derived strains expressing alloenzymes *1, *2, *3, *5, *6 of human sulfotransferase 1A2 (SULT1A2). The reference compounds, 1-hydroxymethylpyrene (1-HMP), N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (OH-AAF) and 2-hydroxylamino-5-phenylpyridine (OH-APP), were activated to mutagens in these strains. Their activity differed 7- to 16-fold between strains expressing various alloenzymes. It was strongest and weakest in the strains expressing the common alloenzymes, *1 and *2, respectively. The SULT1A2 protein expression levels, and the V(max) and K(m) values with the reference substrate 4-nitrophenol, varied 2.5-, 4-, and 110-fold, respectively, in cytosolic preparations from strains TA1538-SULT1A2*1 and *2. Strains with varying protein levels were constructed via insertion of silent mutations in the 5'-part of the cDNA. TA1538-SULT1A2*1Z and TA1538-SULT1A2*2Y showed equal expression levels of alloenzymes *1 and *2, respectively, which were 3 times above those of TA1538-SULT1A2*1. The mutagenicity of OH-AAF and OH-APP was unchanged in strain TA1538-SULT1A2*1Z versus *1, and moderately increased in TA1538-SULT1A2*2Y versus *2. The influence of the protein level was stronger with 1-HMP. Nevertheless, mutagenic activity of 1-HMP was still 11 times higher in TA1538-SULT1A2*1Z than in TA1538-SULT1A2*2Y. Thus, differences in the properties between alloenzymes can lead to differences in the activation of promutagens. The model compounds were also tested in strains expressing the other ten human SULTs identified. Whereas OH-AAF and OH-APP showed the highest mutagenic activities in strains expressing SULT1A2, 1-HMP was more potent in strains expressing other SULT forms. With the limitation that little is known about the tissue distribution and regulation of SULT1A2, the findings suggest that its polymorphism may affect the individual susceptibility towards procarcinogens, in particular certain aromatic amines and amides."

In addition, the patients undergo full blood count are screened for malaria parasites. Of the 65 patients, 50 report febrile conditions, while the remaining 15 are used as a control population. In the febrile group, 13 (26%) were positive for S. typhi, while in the control group only one (7%) was positive for S. typhi. Overall, 36 (64.3%) patients had malaria parasites. Patients with a higher O antibody titre (> or = 1 in 80) by Widal test were found to have consumed both tap water and pure water. More females (10/14; mean age: 33) had typhoid fever as a result of S. typhi infection, the majority of which were isolated from stool samples (57%). Nine of the isolates were also positive for malaria parasites, seven of which were in the trophozoite stage. Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant parasite (78%), the remainder being P. malariae. The majority of patients (12/14) with typhoid fever had normal PCV values. In conclusion, it is recommended that tests for the diagnosis of typhoid fever in Nigeria should include malaria parasites, S. typhi culture from faecal samples, and the Widal test."

He had stayed in India from Sept. 6, 1990 to Oct. 13, 1990. On Oct. 25, 1990, he complained of a high fever and headache. On Oct. 29, he was admitted to our hospital and was diagnosed as Salmonellosis paratyphi A by the blood culture. He was treated with 2.0 g/day of chloramphenicol (CP) for 7 days, but the clinical efficacy was not sufficient. Therefore, we added 900 mg/day of OFLX for 10 days.

CD008892,0,22719249,0,The Salmonella deubiquitinase SseL inhibits selective autophagy of cytosolic aggregates.,"Cell stress and infection promote the formation of ubiquitinated aggregates in both non-immune and immune cells. These structures are recognised by the autophagy receptor p62/sequestosome 1 and are substrates for selective autophagy. The intracellular growth of Salmonella enterica occurs in a membranous compartment, the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), and is dependent on effectors translocated to the host cytoplasm by the Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 (SPI-2) encoded type III secretion system (T3SS). Here, we show that bacterial replication is accompanied by the formation of ubiquitinated structures in infected cells. Analysis of bacterial strains carrying mutations in genes encoding SPI-2 T3SS effectors revealed that in epithelial cells, formation of these ubiquitinated structures is dependent on SPI-2 T3SS effector translocation, but is counteracted by the SPI-2 T3SS deubiquitinase SseL. In macrophages, both SPI-2 T3SS-dependent aggregates and aggresome-like induced structures (ALIS) are deubiquitinated by SseL. In the absence of SseL activity, ubiquitinated structures are recognized by the autophagy receptor p62, which recruits LC3 and targets them for autophagic degradation. We found that SseL activity lowers autophagic flux and favours intracellular Salmonella replication. Our data therefore show that there is a host selective autophagy response to intracellular Salmonella infection, which is counteracted by the deubiquitinase SseL."

CD008892,0,1629332,0,"Typhus and typhuslike rickettsiae associated with opossums and their fleas in Los Angeles County, California.","The recent discovery of cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) infected with a typhuslike rickettsia (designated the ELB agent) raises the question of whether similar rickettsial infections exist in wild cat flea populations. We verified the presence of the ELB agent and Rickettsia typhi in urban and suburban areas of Los Angeles, Calif. Opossums trapped in close proximity to the residences of human murine typhus cases in Los Angeles county and other areas within the city of Los Angeles were tested for the presence of typhus group rickettsiae by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of rickettsiae in the spleen tissues of three opossums (n = 9) and in 66 opossum fleas (n = 205) was determined by PCR and was verified by dot blot and Southern transfer hybridization. Further analysis of the amplified PCR products generated by a series of primer pairs derived from either the 17-kDa antigen gene or the citrate synthase gene revealed that both R. typhi and the ELB agent were present in the tested samples. Dual infection was not noted in the samples; however, the fleas were infected with either R. typhi or the ELB agent. The presence of the ELB agent in the cat flea population may have implications for public health. Whether this agent is responsible for the mild cases of human murine typhus in urban and suburban areas of Los Angeles or in other endemic foci remains to be determined."

A great majority of cases occur in children living in poor sanitary conditions in squatter settlements in large cities. We conducted a case-control study to identify risk factor for typhoid fever in children under the age of 16 years residing in squatter settlements of Karachi. We enrolled 88 typhoid fever patients, diagnosed by positive blood culture or Typhidot test, between June 1999 and December 2001. Simultaneously, we enrolled 165 age-matched neighborhood controls. Multivariate analysis done through conditional binary logistic regression analysis technique showed that increasing number of persons in the household (odds ratio [OR]=1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.1), non-availability of soap near hand washing facility (OR=2.6; 95% CI 1.1-6.3), non-use of medicated soap (OR=11.2; 95% CI 1.3-97.6) and lack of awareness about contact with a known case of typhoid fever (OR=3.7; 95% CI 1.6-8.4) were independent risk factors of the disease.

CD008892,0,10692365,0,Specificity mutants of the binding protein of the oligopeptide transport system of Lactococcus lactis.,"The kinetic properties of wild-type and mutant oligopeptide binding proteins of Lactococcus lactis were determined. To observe the properties of the mutant proteins in vivo, the oppA gene was deleted from the chromosome of L. lactis to produce a strain that was totally defective in oligopeptide transport. Amplified expression of the oppA gene resulted in an 8- to 12-fold increase in OppA protein relative to the wild-type level. The amplified expression was paralleled by increased bradykinin binding activity, but had relatively little effect on the overall transport of bradykinin via Opp. Several site-directed mutants were constructed on the basis of a comparison of the primary sequences of OppA from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and L. lactis, taking into account the known structure of the serovar Typhimurium protein. Putative peptide binding-site residues were mutated. All the mutant OppA proteins exhibited a decreased binding affinity for the high-affinity peptide bradykinin. Except for OppA(D471R), the mutant OppA proteins displayed highly defective bradykinin uptake, whereas the transport of the low-affinity substrate KYGK was barely affected. Cells expressing OppA(D471R) had a similar K(m) for transport, whereas the V(max) was increased more than twofold as compared to the wild-type protein. The data are discussed in the light of a kinetic model and imply that the rate of transport is determined to a large extent by the donation of the peptide from the OppA protein to the translocator complex."
CD008892,0,7130702,0,Vi serology in screening of typhoid carriers: improved specificity by detection of Vi antibodies by counterimmunoelectrophoresis.,"A purified soluble Vi antigen was used in counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE), passive haemagglutination (HA) and solid phase radio-immunoassay (SPRIA) for detection of serum Vi antibody. Serum Vi antibody was detected in 13 of 14 chronic typhoid carriers by both CIE and HA. SPRIA studies showed that Vi antibodies in sera of these carriers were mainly of the IgG class. Successful treatment with amoxycillin in one carrier, who initially showed a positive Vi test, resulted in a reversion in 6 months to seronegativity as measured by Vi CIE. However, Vi antibody was also detected in 10 sera (3%) from 329 control subjects by HA but not by CIE. When the CIE assay was applied to 1030 serum specimens obtained from hospitalized patients, it was able to detect one typhoid carrier, but one (0.1%) non-carrier also gave a positive Vi CIE test. It is thus concluded that Vi CIE is more specific and no less sensitive than Vi HA for the detection of the typhoid carrier state. The finding by SPRIA that the anti-Vi antibodies present in typhoid carriers' sera were mainly of the IgG class further justified the use of CIE as a precipitation test for their detection."
CD008892,0,7872445,0,Treatment of typhoid fever: randomized trial of a three-day course of ceftriaxone versus a fourteen-day course of chloramphenicol.,"To compare the efficacy of a short course of ceftriaxone with a standard course of chloramphenicol for typhoid fever, a randomized trial was conducted in 46 patients (30 adults and 16 children) who were blood culture-positive for Salmonella typhi or S. paratyphi. Ceftriaxone was given intravenously once a day for three days to 15 adults at a dose of 2 g/day and to eight children at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. Chloramphenicol was given orally four times a day to an equal number of patients at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day until defervescence, followed by 40 mg/kg/day for a total of 14 days. Clinical cure without complications or relapse occurred in 19 patients (83%) treated with ceftriaxone and in 20 patients (87%) treated with chloramphenicol (P > 0.05). Four patients with clinical failures in the ceftriaxone group included two with fever lasting six days or more, one with altered sensorium, and one with relapse; three patients treated with chloramphenicol developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia and were switched to amoxicillin therapy. Bacteriologically, blood cultures of all 46 patients were sterile three days after the start of treatment, and remained so through day 15 of follow-up. These results extend previous observations on the efficacy of ceftriaxone in short courses for both adults and children with typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,23163213,0,Modifications influencing Widal test reactivity in a novel microplate assay.,"Reliability of the Widal tube agglutination test has been the subject of many controversies over the years. This study was performed to assess the effect of certain modifications on the performance of Widal test in a novel microplate assay. Sera from 37 patients (21 males; 16 females) (mean age 28 +/- 7 years) were tested in the Immunology Unit at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh. Among them were 26 patients with suspected typhoid fever and 11 had bacteriologically confirmed diagnosis of Salmonella infection. The modifications included either the use of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), absorption of sera with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) or heat inactivation of sera. Compared with Widal tube agglutination test, microplate assay with SRBC absorption of the sera from patients with suspected typhoid fever was not only associated with enhancement of detection titers for both H (p < or = 0.001) and O (p < or = 0.005) Salmonella agglutinins but also the percentage of reactivity. The presence of BSA augmented detection titers for Salmonella H agglutinins (p < or = 0.02) only. Heat inactivation of sera however was found to be associated with reduction in the detectable titers for both H (p < or = 0.03) and O (p < or = 0.01) agglutinins. Increased titers of Salmonella agglutinins were also evident in 11 patients with confirmed diagnosis of Salmonella infection. The novel microplate agglutination assay using the SRBC absorption was associated with enhancement in Widal test reactivity and appears to be a useful alternative for the diagnosis of Salmonella infection."
CD008892,0,896409,0,[Current biological aspects of typhoid fever (author's transl)].,"The biological signs of typhoid fever are studied on the basis of 90 cases collected over a period of 5 years. Average neutrophil granulocyte count before treatment was 5000 with extremes ranging from 1400 to 12180. The development of granulocytopaenia during treatment may be seen not only in patients treated with phenicols but also in those treated with ampicillin or the combination trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. It was possible to isolate the organism in 88 per cent of cases, either by blood culture (79%) or by stool culture (23%). Antibodies (O and H agglutinins) were found in only 86 per cent of cases, and for H agglutinins only there was a significant and transient increase in antibodies. This underlines the importance of the combined examination of three biological criteria - blood culture, stool culture and serology - in reaching the diagnosis of typhoid, the relatively asymptomatic forms of which are becoming increasingly frequent."

Of 97 children with suspected typhoid fever, the disease was confirmed bacteriologically in 46 (47%), whereas 25 (26%) were considered to have typhoid fever on clinical grounds. An alternative diagnosis was made in 26 (27%). The Typhidot and Typhidot-M were superior to the Widal test in their diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, although values (sensitivity = 85-94% and specificity = 77-89%) were significantly lower than in other regional reports. The lower specificity of the Typhidot in our series may represent regional differences in the genomic structure and plasticity of the OMP of S. typhi and merits further evaluation of these tests in diverse geographic locations."

A large outbreak of SPA occurred in a boarding middle school in China in 2004. There were 394 suspected cases; 95·5% were students. The highest incidence was in the youngest children (7th grade). Forty-four of 151 (29%) blood cultures and 4/54 (7·4%) rectal swabs were positive for SPA; three were from kitchen workers. The geometric mean levels of serum IgG anti-lipopolysaccharide (anti-LPS) from patients was higher than from healthy individuals [35·25 vs. 5·20 ELISA units (EU), P<0·001]. A kitchen worker with a positive rectal swab, negative blood culture and a high level of serum IgG anti-LPS (529·65 EU), was identified as a possible SPA carrier. No SPA was isolated from water or food samples. A survey of students' habits indicated drinking unboiled water as being the main reason for contracting the disease. Hand washing was the second most important factor. A food handler with possible SPA carriage could also have been a risk factor. Attention to maintaining a safe water supply, enhancing food-handler hygiene and proper hand washing can help to prevent similar outbreaks in the future."
CD008892,0,17173991,0,A simple nucleic acid hybridization/latex agglutination assay for the rapid detection of polymerase chain reaction amplicons.,"We have developed a new method for the detection of nucleic acid hybridization, based on a simple latex agglutination test that can be evaluated by the unaided eye. Nucleic acid, e.g., a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, is denatured and incubated with polystyrene beads carrying covalently bound complementary oligonucleotide sequences. Hybridization of the nucleic acids leads to aggregation of the latex particles, thereby verifying the presence of target sequence. The test is performed at room temperature, and results are available within 10 min. As a proof of principle, the hybridization/latex agglutination assay was applied to the detection of purified PCR fragments either specific for Salmonella spp. or a synthetic sequence, and to the detection of Salmonella enterica in artificially contaminated chicken samples. A few nanograms of purified PCR fragments were detectable. In artificially contaminated chicken samples, 3 colony-forming units (cfu)/25 g were detected in one of three replicates, and 30 cfu/25 g were detected in both of two replicates when samples for PCR were taken directly from primary enrichment, demonstrating the practical applicability of this test system. Even multiplex detection might be achievable. This novel kind of assay could be useful for a range of applications where hybridization of nucleic acids, e.g., PCR fragments, is to be detected."

Standardized interviews were conducted with questions regarding recent contact with a typhoid fever patient, eating habits, hygiene and socio-economic level. Cases were more likely to have been in contact with a patient with typhoid fever than hospital controls (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 5.2, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.7-15.9) or community controls (adjusted OR = 11.9, 95% CI 2.3-60.7); 11% and 14% of typhoid fever cases (compared to hospital or community controls, respectively) were attributable to recent contact with a patient with this disease. These findings suggest that strategies directed towards the persons in contact with a patient might reduce the incidence of secondary cases of typhoid fever."

CD008892,0,23052321,0,Bacterial coinfections in travelers with malaria: rationale for antibiotic therapy.,"Malaria predisposes children in areas where malaria is endemic to concurrent bacteremia, often with severe outcomes. The importance of bacterial coinfections in patients diagnosed with malaria in nonendemic settings has, however, not been reported. A retrospective analysis of microbiology data was performed in 755 travelers diagnosed with malaria in Sweden. Bacterial cultures from blood and other locations were correlated to clinical outcome and antibiotic treatment. Blood cultures were drawn from 417 (55%) patients (88% of whom were >15 years old), and bacterial isolates of clinical relevance (Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Escherichia coli) were detected in 2 patients (0.3%). Cultures from other locations (mainly urine, nasopharyngeal, and fecal samples) were obtained from 44% of the patients with 4.9% positivity. Of the 38 patients given antibiotics, 47% had neither severe malaria nor positive cultures and/or radiology signs indicative of treatment. C-reactive protein levels were associated with bacterial infections but had only a fair predictive value. Bacterial coinfections are uncommon among travelers with malaria. These data suggest a weaker association between malaria and bacteremia than previously described in endemic settings and might indicate different patient populations with different pathophysiological mechanisms and microbial environments. The study supports a restrictive antibiotic policy in returning travelers with malaria."
CD008892,0,23082592,0,Abdominal ultrasonographic findings in typhoid fever: a comparison between typhoid patients and those with non-typhoidal Salmonella and Campylobacter jejuni enterocolitis.,Typhoid fever is a major health problem in many developing countries and its clinical features are similar to other types of bacterial enterocolitis. Definitive diagnosis by blood culture requires several days and is often unfeasible to perform in developing countries. More efficient and rapid diagnostic methods for typhoid are needed. We compared the pathological changes in the bowel and adjacent tissues of patients having typhoid fever with those having bacterial enterocolitis using ultrasonography. A characteristic of patients with non-typhoidal Salmonella and Campylobacter jejuni enterocolitis was mural thickening of the terminal ileum; only mild mural swelling or no swelling was observed in patients with typhoid fever. Mesenteric lymph nodes in patients with typhoid fever were significantly more enlarged compared to patients with other types of bacterial enterocolitis. Our findings suggest typhoid fever is not fundamentally an enteric disease but rather resembles mesenteric lymphadenopathy and ultrasound is a promising modality for diagnosing typhoid fever in developing countries.

To study the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone in acute typhoid fever, 10 febrile Nepalese adolescents and young adults with blood culture-positive illness were treated with 3 g of ceftriaxone (intravenous infusion for 30 min) daily for 3 days. On the 1st and 3rd day of treatment, blood and urine samples were collected at defined intervals for measurements of drug concentrations. Kinetic parameters including concentrations at the end of infusion (Cmax) and 24 h after the end of infusion (Cmin), elimination half-life (t1/2), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), total plasma clearance, renal clearance, percentage excreted in urine, and volume of distribution were estimated. On day 1, mean values were as follows: Cmax, 291 micrograms/ml; Cmin, 21.7 micrograms/ml; plasma t1/2, 5.2 h; AUC, 1,428 micrograms.h/ml; total plasma clearance, 37 ml/min; renal clearance, 19 ml/min; percentage excreted in urine, 49.7%; and volume of distribution, 16.1 liters. Mean values on day 3 were not significantly different from those on day 1. Compared with published values for healthy volunteers who received the same dose, our mean t1/2s and AUCs were lower and our mean total plasma clearances, renal clearances, and volumes of distribution were higher. The good clinical responses of these patients to therapy and the adequate Cmins support the use of ceftriaxone once daily for the treatment of typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,19726596,0,Comparison of the EntericBio multiplex PCR system with routine culture for detection of bacterial enteric pathogens.,"The EntericBio system uses a multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., and Escherichia coli O157 from feces. It combines overnight broth enrichment with PCR amplification and detection by hybridization. An evaluation of this system was conducted by comparing the results obtained with the system with those obtained by routine culture, supplemented with alternative PCR detection methods. In a study of 773 samples, routine culture and the EntericBio system yielded 94.6 and 92.4% negative results, respectively. Forty-two samples had positive results by culture, and all of these were positive with the EntericBio system. This system detected an additional 17 positive samples (Campylobacter spp., n = 12; Shigella spp., n = 1; E. coli O157, n = 4), but the results for 5 samples (Campylobacter spp., n = 2; Shigella spp., n = 1; E. coli O157, n = 2) could not be confirmed. The target for Shigella spp. detected by the EntericBio system is the ipaH gene, and the molecular indication of the presence of Shigella spp. was investigated by sequence analysis, which confirmed that the ipaH gene was present in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from the patient. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 99.3%, 91.5%, and 100%, respectively. Turnaround times were significantly reduced with the EntericBio system, and a result was available between 24 and 32 h after receipt of the sample in the laboratory. In addition, the amount of laboratory waste was significantly reduced by use of this system. In summary, the EntericBio system proved convenient to use, more sensitive than the conventional culture used in this study, and highly specific; and it generated results significantly faster than routine culture for the pathogens tested."

In those who failed to respond a second trial of therapy with one of the other two drugs was initiated, after excluding the first drug. A second failure of therapy was taken as an indication to use pefloxacin singly. Finally, 18 (64.3%) cases responded to chloramphenicol or amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole. Pefloxacin was used in 10 (35.7%) cases. The failure rate of treatment with chloramphenicol was 50%, with amoxycillin 71.4% with co-trimoxazole 75% and 0% with pefloxacin. An analysis of the 28 cases revealed that apart from fever (in 100%), splenomegaly (in 82.1%) was the most important clinical indicator to diagnosis. along with absolute eosinopenia (in 71.4%). There were no major complications, except 2 cases with typhoid hepatitis that responded to choramphenicol and co-trimoxazole, respectively. Blood culture grew Salmonella typhi in 7 cases of which 5 (72%) were multi drug resistant S. typhi."
CD008892,0,7940513,0,[Evaluation of three commercial ELISA test kits for the detection of antibodies against Salmonella enteritidis].,"We evaluated three commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test-kits, using either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or flagellar extracts as antigens, for the demonstration of Salmonella enteritidis (S. e.) antibodies in serum and egg yolk. They were also compared with conventional serological tests, such as the pullorum rapid slide agglutination test (RST), the pullorum slow agglutination tube test and a rapid slide agglutination test, using gm flagellar extracts as antigen. We tested sera and eggs from six different layer flocks. In 84.1 to 90% of the sera and egg yolks tested the three commercial ELISA test kits gave comparable results. There were a number of serological cross-reaction with other serovars, particularly S. typhimurium. However, the possibility of infections with more than one salmonella serovar, other than S. e., cannot be excluded. The ELISA-antibody levels in serum and egg yolk ran parallel and were still high after one year. However, the level of egg yolk antibodies was on an average 33.9% lower than in serum. The S. e.-ELISA seems to be well suited for epidemiological investigations and for preventive and control measures."
CD008892,0,3438648,0,"Control of typhoid fever in Bangkok, Thailand, by annual immunization of schoolchildren with parenteral typhoid vaccine.","The number of cases of typhoid fever in Bangkok, Thailand, began to increase sharply in 1974 and peaked in 1976. In 1977, as part of a national typhoid immunization program, Thai schoolchildren aged seven to 12 years began to receive annually a single 0.25-ml subcutaneous dose (2.5 x 10(8) organisms) of a heat/phenol-inactivated typhoid vaccine. Isolations of Salmonella typhi in Bangkok decreased from 880 (4.6% of all blood cultures) in 1976 to 54 (0.3% of all blood cultures) in 1985. The case ratio of S. typhi to Salmonella paratyphi A infection declined from 4.1:1 before the epidemic (1970-1973) to 0.9:1 after the epidemic (1984-1985), and the proportion of cases of typhoid fever occurring among children aged seven to 12 years significantly decreased from 30% to 10%. During the same periods S. paratyphi A isolation rates did not significantly decrease (in terms of either total number or percentage of cases) in school-aged children. Thus, mass vaccination of schoolchildren in Thailand with the heat-inactivated typhoid vaccine has been closely associated with a sharp decline in typhoid fever in Bangkok during an epidemic and with continuous control after the epidemic."

Incidence of salmonella bacteriemia varied in different studies between 5.2-13.7%. The incidence is higher in patients younger than 1 year and the elderly. Among different serotypes, the most invasive are Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella choleraesuis and Salmonella Virchow. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of salmonella bacteriemia among patients hospitalized at the Clinic of Infectious Diseases Novi Sad during 1991-1998, and to point to certain risk factors for salmonella bacteriemia."
CD008892,0,2074375,0,[A case of bacteremia due to Salmonella enteritidis in healthy man].,"Although bacteremia caused by non-typhoidal salmonella is frequently observed in immunocompromised hosts, it is rare to find this condition in healthy subjects. In this report, we present a case of bacteremia due to Salmonella enteritidis detected in a healthy man. A 59-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a fifty-day history of fever on May 18, 1985. On admission, he showed no symptoms except high body temperature (38.8 degrees C). In the laboratory data, C-reactive protein was 3+, white- cell count was 9600, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 mm/h. Culture in blood and stool yielded Salmonella enteritidis. However, no abnormal findings were found in UGIS, barium enema, OC + DIC, abdominal CT and echography. As soon as Ampicillin was administered, the fever was gone and the blood culture yielded nothing. After six months, the stool culture was negative for pathological intestinal bacterial flora and he was in good physical condition. Generally, bacteremia develops mainly in the immunocompromised hosts, such as patients with neoplastic disease, AIDS, leukemia or collagen disease. The literature provides so far twenty three adult cases of bacteremia due to non-typhoidal salmonella in Japan. Only two of them had no systemic disease as well as our case. Although it is unknown why bacteremia developed in this healthy man, we reported that bacteremia developed rarely in subjects with healthy condition."

CD008892,0,7011996,0,Characterization of murine antibody response to Salmonella typhimurium by a class-specific solid-phase radioimmunoassay.,"A heavy-chain class-specific, solid-phase radioimmunoassay was developed to characterize the murine antibody response to Salmonella typhimurium. The specificity of the assay was verified by quantitation of the extent of binding of anti-S. typhimurium antibodies to other bacterial genera and species and by cross-adsorption studies. The sensitivity of the procedure was also examined, and it was determined to be substantially more sensitive than either the passive hemagglutination or the whole-cell agglutination technique. The method was subsequently used to analyze th murine antibody response to S. typhimurium. Groups of mice were prebled and then immunized with live S. typhimurium via different routes. The animals were bled weekly for 12 weeks, and then sera were assayed for antibodies directed against whole bacteria or purified lipopolysaccharide. Anti-Salmonella antibodies of the immunoglobulin M class appeared in the serum approximately 2 to 3 weeks after immunization, and then immunoglobulin G anti-Salmonella antibodies appeared which constituted the major part of the long-term response. Immunoglobulin A was not a major component of the serum antibody response. The antibodies were primarily directed against the lipopolysaccharide determinants, but a small percentage of the response was directed against other cell surface components. Qualitatively and quantitatively similar anti-Salmonella antibody responses were observed in sera of outbred and inbred strains of mice."
CD008892,0,7497349,0,[Study of a typhoid fever outbreak in Baiona (Pontevedra)].,"Despite of the fact of being a high endemic treat, the notification of a typhoid fever outbreak produces a very unusual epidemiological happening in our province.

CD008892,0,10801292,0,Differential inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in systemic and pulmonary vessels after endotoxin.,"Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is associated with vascular hypocontractility in systemic vessels after endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Although lung iNOS is increased after LPS, its role in the pulmonary circulation is unclear. We hypothesized that whereas iNOS upregulation is responsible for LPS-induced vascular dysfunction in systemic vessels, iNOS does not play a significant role in the pulmonary artery (PA). Using isolated aorta (AO) and PA rings, we examined the effect of nonselective NOS inhibition [N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA); 100 micromol/l] and selective iNOS inhibition (aminoguanidine, AG; 100 micromol/l) on alpha(1)-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction (phenylephrine; 10(-9) to 10(-3) M) after LPS (Salmonella typhimurium, 20 mg/kg ip). We also determined the presence of iNOS using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. LPS markedly impaired AO contractility (maximal control tension 1,076 +/- 33 mg vs. LPS 412 +/- 39 mg, P < 0.05), but PA contractility was unchanged (control 466 +/- 29 mg vs. LPS 455 +/- 27 mg, P > 0.05). Selective iNOS inhibition restored the AO's response to vasoconstriction (LPS + AG 1,135 +/- 54 mg, P > 0.05 vs. control and P < 0.05 vs. LPS), but had no effect on the PA (LPS + AG 422 +/- 38 mg, P > 0.05 vs. control and LPS). Western blot and immunohistochemistry revealed increased iNOS expression in the AO after LPS, but iNOS was not detected in the PA. Our results suggest that differential iNOS expression after LPS in systemic and pulmonary vessels contributes to the phenomenon of sepsis/endotoxemia-induced systemic hypotension and pulmonary hypertension."
CD008892,0,6833514,0,Significance and value of the Widal test in the diagnosis of typhoid fever in an endemic area.,"The diagnostic value of the Widal test was assessed in an endemic area. The test was done on 300 normal individuals, 297 non-typhoidal fevers and 275 bacteriologically proven cases of typhoid. Of 300 normal individuals, 2% had an H agglutinin titre of 1/160 and 5% had an O agglutinin titre of 1/160. On the basis of these criteria a significant H and/or O agglutinin titre of 1/320 or more was observed in 93-97% of typhoid cases and in only 3% of patients with non-typhoidal fever. Of the sera from typhoid cases which gave a significant Widal reaction, the majority (79.9%) showed increases in both H and O agglutinins and 51 of 234 (21.8%) of these sera were collected in the first week of illness. The significance and implications of these findings are discussed."
CD008892,0,11201672,0,Mutagenicity of N-nitrosodiethylamine in the Ames test with S. typhimurium TA1535 is due to volatile metabolites and is not dependent on cytochrome P4502E1 induction.,"N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) is carcinogenic in all investigated animal species at relatively low dosages. No threshold has been detected for these carcinogenic effects. The substance has been extensively investigated in various in vitro systems, revealing only weak mutagenicity at relatively high dosages. We reinvestigated NDEA in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 to establish appropriate modifications of the standard Ames test protocol, to achieve a dose-dependent mutagenic response at a reasonably low dose range. Two main modifications were evaluated. Since the metabolism of dialkylnitrosamines is postulated to be mainly dependent on cytochrome P4502E1, a pyrazole-induced rat liver S9 was applied. The second modification involved a gastight preincubation, since metabolites of NDEA might evaporate from the incubation mixture. Cytochrome P4502E1 induction in Wistar rats was achieved by pyrazole treatment. For comparison, a rat liver S9-fraction produced by beta-naphtoflavone/phenobarbital induction was used. N-Nitrosopyrrolidine served as positive control for pyrazole-induced S9-mix with TA1535. NDEA showed no mutagenic response under all test conditions in the presence of pyrazole-induced S9-mix. A strong mutagenic response, exceeding the base rate up to 15-fold at a dose range of 25-1000 microg/plate, was observed using beta-naphtoflavone/phenobarbital-induced S9-mix, gastight preincubation and TA1535. In conclusion the Ames test with gastight preincubation can be useful for the testing of volatile compounds or substances leading to gaseous metabolites. The weak response of NDEA in the Ames test observed previously seems mainly to be due to the volatile character of its mutagenic metabolites. Our results do not support the hypothesis that cytochrome P4502E1 is a major toxifying enzyme for the formation of Ames-test-positive metabolites from NDEA."
CD008892,0,8933590,0,Experimental infection of laying hens with Salmonella enteritidis strains that express different types of fimbriae.,"A study was conducted to compare the pathogenicity of three Salmonella enteritidis phage type 8 strains (9, 21, and 30) in 30-wk-old laying hens. Strain 9 expressed two types of fimbriae of 14 and 21 kDa. Strain 30 expressed a single fimbrial type (21 kDa). Strain 21 did not express any fimbrial protein. Laying hens were divided into three groups of 35 each and each group was orally inoculated with a single S. enteritidis strain (1 x 10(8) cfu per bird). Significantly less intensive cecal colonization and fecal shedding of the organism were observed in hens that were inoculated with the strain that did not express fimbriae than in birds inoculated with other two strains (P < 0.05). Isolation of S. enteritidis from liver, spleen, reproductive organs, and egg contents did not differ between groups. Mean serum S. enteritidis lipopolysaccharide-specific antibody titers of birds inoculated with strain 21 were lower than titers of hens that were inoculated with the other two strains from the 5th wk through the end of the trial. Immunoblot of the bacterial outer membrane structures revealed the presence of serum antibodies against lipopolysaccharide, membrane-associated proteins, and purified 14 kDa fimbrial protein in birds inoculated with strain 9 as late as 9 wk postinoculation. Results of this study are consistent with a role for fimbrial proteins in the cecal colonization by S. enteritidis. In addition, cecal colonization mediated by fimbrial proteins may enhance the elicitation of humoral immune response against S. enteritidis."
CD008892,0,2424936,1,Comparison of passive haemagglutination test with Widal agglutination test for serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in an endemic area.,"A passive haemagglutination test, using sheep red blood cells sensitised with Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide, was compared with the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in an endemic area. The results obtained on sera from 152 patients with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid and 183 patients who did not have typhoid were analysed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and rapidity of the respective tests. The passive haemagglutination test was found to be more sensitive (80%) than the S typhi O antigen (71%) but marginally less sensitive than the H antigen (82%) of the Widal test. The false positive rate on control sera was 1.2% and 6.6%, respectively, for the Widal O and H antigens, and 1.6% for the passive haemagglutination test. Our findings indicate that the passive haemagglutination test is comparable with the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in endemic areas, but is more simple, rapid, and economic. The passive haemagglutination test may be a useful alternative to the Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever in busy microbiology laboratories in areas in which the disease is endemic."
CD008892,0,26082464,0,Understanding paratyphoid infection: study protocol for the development of a human model of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A challenge in healthy adult volunteers.,This study will develop the first human challenge model of paratyphoid infection which may then be taken forward to evaluate paratyphoid vaccine candidates. Salmonella Paratyphi A is believed to cause a quarter of the estimated 20 million cases of enteric fever annually. Epidemiological evidence also suggests that an increasing proportion of the enteric fever burden is attributable to S. Paratyphi infection meriting further attention and interest in vaccine development. Assessment of paratyphoid vaccine efficacy in preclinical studies is complicated by the lack of a small animal model and the human-restricted nature of the infection. The use of experimental human infection in healthy volunteers provides an opportunity to address these problems in a cost-effective manner.
CD008892,0,9006037,0,Assembly of the switch complex onto the MS ring complex of Salmonella typhimurium does not require any other flagellar proteins.,"The cytoplasmic portion of the bacterial flagellum is thought to consist of at least two structural components: a switch complex and an export apparatus. These components seem to assemble around the MS ring complex, which is the first flagellar basal body substructure and is located in the cytoplasmic membrane. In order to elucidate the process of assembly of cytoplasmic substructures, the membrane localization of each component of the switch complex (FliG, FliM, and FliN) in various nonflagellated mutants was examined by immunoblotting. It was found that all these switch proteins require the MS ring protein FliF to associate with the cell membrane. FliG does not require FliM and FliN for this association, but FliM and FliN associate cooperatively with the membrane only through FliG. Furthermore, all three switch proteins were detected in membranes isolated from fliE, fliH, fliI, fliJ, fliO, fliP, fliQ, fliR, flhA, flhB, and flgJ mutants, indicating that the switch complex assembles on the MS ring complex without any other flagellar proteins involved in the early stage of flagellar assembly. The relationship between the switch complex and the export apparatus is discussed."
CD008892,0,15804598,0,Cytokine production of stimulated whole blood cultures in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving short-term infliximab therapy.,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) strategies have an increased susceptibility to infections, especially those caused by intracellular pathogens. In this study we assessed the cytokine production capacity in patients with RA and we further investigated whether anti-TNF therapy modulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the resistance against infections. Whole blood cultures from 10 RA patients and 10 healthy controls were stimulated with heat-killed Candida albicans, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphyloccocus aureus, Aspergillus fumigatus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis and production of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma and TNF-alpha was measured. Before anti-TNF therapy, whole blood cultures from RA patients released significantly less IFN-gamma than healthy controls after stimulation with all tested microorganisms. Short-term anti-TNF therapy did not have an inhibitory effect on the release of the cytokines tested. We conclude that cells of patients with RA have a strongly reduced production capacity of IFN-gamma after bacterial challenge. Although short-term therapy with anti-TNF agents did not further decrease the release of other proinflammatory cytokines, the combination of defective IFN-gamma production in basal conditions and TNF neutralization during anti-TNF therapy is likely to be responsible for the higher susceptibility to infections in patients with RA."
CD008892,0,19745517,0,The laboratory diagnosis of enteric fever.,"The diagnosis of enteric fever currently depends upon the isolation of Salmonella from a patient, most commonly by blood culture. This facility is not available in many areas where the disease is endemic. Serodiagnosis depends upon the 100-year-old Widal test, and other serological diagnostic tools have limitations because of their low sensitivity and/or specificity. The most promising recently published results are from PCR-based amplification of DNA from the blood of enteric fever patients but again this technique is not available where it is most needed. Antigen detection has not been investigated for well over three decades and detecting an immune response specific for typhoid fever has been done only with antibody detection. There is an urgent need for the rational design and evaluation of effective and appropriate diagnostics for enteric fever which must include the emerging threat of S. Paratyphi A."

Both dipsticks were simple and accurate rapid diagnostic assays, and they can be useful adjuncts for the diagnosis of typhoid fever and brucellosis."
CD008892,0,17255243,0,"Detection of Salmonella typhi by nested polymerase chain reaction in blood, urine, and stool samples.","A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi was used for the detection of the pathogen in blood, urine, and stool samples from 131 patients with clinical suspicion of typhoid fever. The sensitivity of blood culture, the PCRs with blood, urine, and feces, and the Widal test were 61.8%, 84.5%, 69.3%, 46.9%, and 39.0%, respectively. The sensitivity of the PCRs with blood (P < 0.001) and urine (P = 0.01) were significantly higher, and the sensitivity of the PCR with feces (P > 0.05) was similar to that of blood culture. Combined, the PCRs on urine and feces showed positive results for 16 (70%) of 23 typhoid patients with negative results with blood culture and PCR with blood. These results show that the PCR with blood is a sensitive method for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and that the PCRs with urine and feces could be useful complementary tests."
CD008892,0,10805996,0,Assessment of the water-extractable genotoxic potential of soil samples from contaminated sites.,"A screening method for the evaluation of the water-extractable genotoxic potential of soil is proposed. Due to the low sensitivity of genotoxicity test systems, PAD-1 resin was used as solid phase to concentrate less hydrophilic compounds from aqueous soil extracts. Concentrated and nonconcentrated aqueous soil extracts from 19 soil samples were evaluated using three genotoxicity assays: the umu test according to the German standard method with Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002, the NM2009 test with S. typhimurium NM2009, and the SOS Chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ37. All tests were performed according to a uniform protocol using microplates. Results indicate that the nonconcentrated water elutriates should be tested because the genotoxic potential of some soil samples is extremely high. Additionally, water elutriates should be concentrated by solid phase extraction to avoid false-negative results. The results of this study show that the genotoxic risk of sites contaminated with PAHs or mineral oils may be underestimated if only nonconcentrated samples are tested. The solid-phase extraction method with a concentration factor of 30 for these low soluble compounds is suitable for distinguishing between background genotoxicity of noncontaminated sites and anthropogenic contaminations."

CD008892,0,10773905,1,Rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever.,"A Reverse Passive Haemagglutination Test (RPHA) was designed for the detection of Salmonella typhi antigen and rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever. Two per cent fresh sheep RBC's were coated with 32 micrograms/ml of immunoglobulin. The minimal detectable level of the antigen was 1250 micrograms/ml. Cross reactions were observed with the samples of patients suffering from Salmonella paratyphi A and pseudomonas infections. The RPHA established was used for the detection of S. typhi antigen in culture broths from 100 patients with clinically suspected typhoid fever with culture and/or widal positive, 50 patients with septicemia caused by bacteria other than S. typhi and 50 normal, afebrile healthy controls. It was found that the sensitivity and specificity of this assay was 70% and 92% respectively."
CD008892,0,14583638,0,Combination effect of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin against clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar typhi with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.,"The present study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) in combination with gentamicin (GM) using agar dilution checkerboard method against six blood culture isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi with CPFX minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.75 - 1.25 microg/ml and GM MIC values of 0.75 - 2 microg/ml. When used in combination, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values of CPFX and GM for the isolates ranged from 0.008 - 0.032 microg/ml and 0.1 - 0.2 microg/ml, respectively. The range of the FIC index from 0.121 - 0.216 indicated the synergistic effect between CPFX and GM for all the isolates. The time-kill method, which showed a 2.64 log(10) decrease in CFU/ml between the combination and its more active compound, also established synergism between CPFX and GM against one isolate employed in the method. These results may be helpful in making clinical decisions in the treatment of enteric fever due to the infection of multidrug resistant S. enterica serovar Typhi."
CD008892,0,16697686,0,Differences in gene expression levels and in enzymatic qualities account for the uneven contribution of superoxide dismutases SodCI and SodCII to pathogenicity in Salmonella enterica.,"Most Salmonella enterica serovars produce two periplasmic [Cu,Zn] superoxide dismutases, SodCI, which is prophage encoded, and SodCII, encoded by a conserved chromosomal gene. Both enzymes were proposed to enhance Salmonella virulence by protecting bacteria against products of macrophage oxidative burst. However, we previously found SodCI, but not SodCII, to play a role during mouse infection by S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Here we have extended these findings to another serovar of epidemiological relevance: sv Enteritidis. In both serovars, the dominant role of SodCI in virulence correlates with its higher levels in bacteria proliferating in mouse tissues, relative to SodCII. To analyze the basis of these differences, the coding sequences of sodCI and sodCII genes were exchanged with the reciprocal 5'-regions (in serovar Typhimurium). The accumulation patterns of the two proteins in vivo were reversed as a result, indicating that the regulatory determinants lie entirely within the regions upstream from the initiation codon. In the construct with the sodCI gene fused to the sodCII 5'-region, SodCI contribution to virulence was reduced but remained significant. Thus, both, high-level expression and some unidentified qualities of the enzyme participate in the phenotypic dominance of SodCI over SodCII in Salmonella pathogenicity."

In severe infections like meningitis and septicemia, antibiotic treatment is essential. Extended-spectrum cephalosporins are preferentially used to treat salmonellosis in children. Treatment failures due to in-vivo acquisition of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene in nontyphoidal salmonellae are now well established. A 45-day-old male baby presented to the pediatric intensive care unit with a history of fever, poor feeding, two episodes of seizures of 3 days duration and recurrent apnoea. At admission, cerebrospinal fluid, stool and blood cultures were done and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was isolated from all the samples.

All patients were hospitalized primarily because of fever and were studied by bacteriological and serological methods. Bacteremia due to Salmonella typhi (150 cases), S. enteritidis (36 cases), or both (2 cases) was common in both children and adults. One S. enteritidis isolate was chloramphenicol resistant. Serological evidence of Salmonella infection was found in 130 additional cases without bacteremia. Serological evidence of arbovirus infection (94 cases) was common in children. Malaria was found in 12 adults, most of whom were probably infected outside Jakarta. Little serological evidence was found for rickettsial, leptospiral, Brucella, Toxoplasma gondii or a number of other infections.

The test was evaluated with a total of 234 healthy person and non-typhus patient sera, 89 single and 63 paired typhus patient sera. The positive rate was 92.1% for paired and 80.9% for single sera from patients with typhus. The test gave results consistent with those given by the microimmunofluorescence (Micro-IF) and microagglutination (MA) tests. The sensitivity of the test was higher than Weil-Felix (P less than 0.05) test. This test was simple, rapid, sensitive and specific."

The Widal test has a low sensitivity. We have attempted to adapt the well established enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique to provide a serological test of better sensitivity and specificity. The ELISA described here to detect anti-LPS antibodies was found to have a sensitivity of 89.4 per cent and a specificity of 94.9 per cent. The sensitivity for the antiflagellin ELISA was 68.1 per cent and specificity was 97.4 per cent. The likelihood ratio was 17.5 for anti-LPS ELISA and 26.2 for the anti-flagellin ELISA. Considering the positivity of either one ELISA as diagnostic, the sensitivity was 93.6 per cent and specificity was 94.9 per cent."

Flagellin protein of S. typhi was prepared by recombinant DNA technology. The modification of gold chip with 4-MBA was in-situ characterized by SPR and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. By using kinetic evaluation software, K(D) and B(max) values were calculated and found to be 26.3 fM and 62.04 m°, respectively, for the immobilized monoclonal antibody (Moab) of recombinant flagellin (r-fla) protein of S. typhi (r-fla S. typhi). In addition, thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG, ΔH and ΔS were determined first time for r-fla S. typhi and Moab of r-fla S. typhi interactions and the values revealed the interaction between r-fla S. typhi and Moab of r-fla S. typhi as spontaneous, endothermic and entropy driven one. Moreover, healthy human serum samples and patient sera (Widal positive and Widal negative) were subjected to SPR analysis. The present SPR based approach provides an alternative way for S. typhi detection in less than 10 min."
CD008892,0,380595,0,[Treatment of typhoid fever with chloramphenicol or ampicillin combined with oxyphenbutazone].,"Ninety-four patients with typhoid fever were treated, at random, with three therapeutic regimens: chloramphenicol alone, chloramphenicol plus oxyphenbutazone, and ampicillin plus oxyphenbutazone. The results are evaluated analyzing the body temperature graph and by serial blood had bone marrow cultures taken at intervals until they became negative. Bacteriologic diagnosis was confirmed by blood culture (39.3%) and/or bone marrow culture (77%). The mean duration of fever was 3.3 days for the group treated with chloramphenicol-oxyphenbutazone, 4.3 for those with chloramphenicol alone and 5 days for the group ampicillin-oxyphenbutazone; at the same time, blood cultures became negative at 4.4, 5.5 and 4.4 days respectively. Negativization of bone marrow cultures was not influenced by the addition of oxyphenbutazone. It is concluded that the influence of oxyphenbutazone in shortening the febrile period or in the negativization of blood cultures is not significant. It is considered that oxyphenbutazone is not an important therapeutic tool in this group of diseases."

The strains were confirmed by serology and 119 different Salmonella serotypes were found. The most frequent serotypes were as follows: S. typhimurium, S, enteritidis, S. agona & S. typhi. The strains were classified according to the source of isolation as follows: 6671 strains (62.33%) from clinical samples, mainly of faecal origin; 2903 (27.1%) from food for human consumption; 425 from food for animal consumption, 665 (6.21%) from environment or fomites and 39 (0.36%) from animals. The most frequent serotype in clinical samples was S. typhimurium among 96 different serotypes. The main serotype from blood cultures was S. typhi although 27 other serotypes were found. Of thirteen serotypes related to diarrhoeal outbreaks the higher frequency of S. typhimurium was observed but S. typhi caused more outbreaks. A frequency of 119/> 2000 serotypes was observed, that means less than 5% of Salmonella known serotypes. A yearly variability on serotype predominance was observed as well as changes on source of isolation. This results suggest that epidemiological surveillance of salmonellosis should be continued and improved, looking for cases, asymptomatic carriers and contaminated food for human consumption."

CD008892,0,7515066,0,In vitro and ribosome-bound folding intermediates of P22 tailspike protein detected with monoclonal antibodies.,"It remains unclear whether polypeptide chains renaturing in vitro from strong denaturants proceed through the same folding pathway as chains released from ribosome within cells. Folding intermediates formed both in vivo and in vitro have been examined using three monoclonal antibodies shown previously to recognize different epitopes of the native P22 tailspike protein (Friguet, B., Djavadi-Ohaniance, L., Haase-Pettingell, C. A., King J., and Goldberg, M. E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10347-10351). The tailspike protein was reconstituted from polypeptide chains unfolded by urea as described by Fuchs et al. (Fuchs, A., Seiderer, C., and Seckler, R. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6598-6604), and the appearance of immunoreactive forms during the refolding was monitored. The three antibodies discriminated intermediates at different stages in the folding pathway. On the basis of the reconstitution pathway determined from spectroscopic and hydrodynamic measurements by Fuchs et al. (1991), monoclonal antibody (mAb) 236-3 recognized partially folded monomers, mAb 155-3 recognized folded protomers in a protrimer species, and mAb 33-2 recognized the native trimer. The kinetics of appearance of the immunoreactive forms during the in vitro refolding of the protein in crude extracts of phage-infected cells was similar to that observed with the pure tailspike. Thus, the antibodies provided probes for the chain folding and association pathway in vivo. The conformation of the ribosome-bound tailspike polypeptide chains of the infected cells was analyzed with the three antibodies. The antibodies recognizing native trimer and the protrimer did not bind chains associated with the ribosomes. Antibody 236-3, which recognized structured monomers in vitro, bound to the polypeptide chains still associated with ribosomes. This result suggests that steps that take place in solution during in vitro refolding may occur in a ribosome-bound state in vivo."

Clinical, bacteriological and epidemiological profiles.","A total of 592 children with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever admitted to the Dr B. C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children, Calcutta, India during the period between February 1990 and January 1992, were screened for Salmonella typhi by blood culture. S. typhi was isolated from 221 (37.3%) cases. The majority of the strains (92.3%) showed multi-drug resistant (MDR). They were resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. However, all the strains were uniformly (100%) susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin, furazolidone, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Minimum inhibitory concentration of the antimicrobial agents against the resistant strains of S. typhi ranged between 200 and > 1600 micrograms/ml. Phage type 0 was most frequently encountered. The rate of isolation of S. typhi was more or less the same in all the pediatric age groups. The majority of the cases came from lower socio-economic classes with poor personal hygiene. Fever was the main presenting feature in all the cases. Other associated features of the MDR typhoid fever cases, who were uncomplicated during admission, were headache (36.0%), chill and rigor (23.2%), diarrhea (37.2%), anorexia (26.2%), vomiting (23.8%), cough (18.0%) and abdominal pain (19.8%). Hepatosplenomegaly was present in 42.4% cases. However, complications were less frequently encountered among the MDR typhoid fever cases who were uncomplicated during admission and treated as in-patients. Fourteen bacteriologically-confirmed MDR typhoid fever cases had jaundice and another 18 cases had an abnormal state of consciousness during admission. Four (2.0%) bacteriologically-confirmed MDR typhoid fever patients died during the period of observation."

One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use."

CD008892,0,2498247,0,Changes in the quantity and activity of cytochrome P-450 isozymes in primary cultured rat hepatocytes.,"Hepatocytes from male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with a cytochrome P-450 inducer, 3-methoxy-4-aminoazobenzene (3-MeO-AAB), 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) or phenobarbital (PB), were cultured in vitro, and changes in the quantity and activity of microsomal cytochrome P-450 isozymes in the cells were determined by means of immunochemical methods and a bacterial mutation test, respectively. The results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibodies against rat P-450 isozymes revealed that the amount of cytochrome P-450d induced by 3-MeO-AAB or MC declined rapidly during culture and fell to 10 to 15% of the initial value after 24 h. A similar tendency was observed with PB-induced cytochrome P-450b/e. By contrast, cytochrome P-450c in MC-induced hepatocytes declined more slowly than cytochrome P-450d and remained at 45 to 60% of the initial value after 24 h. Similar quantitative changes of the individual cytochrome P-450 isozymes in culture were also observed by immunoblotting using the anti-cytochrome P-450 monoclonal antibodies. Changes in the activities of individual cytochrome P-450 isozymes in hepatocytes by culture were in accordance with the quantitative changes of the cytochromes, as determined by a mutation test using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and carcinogenic aromatic amines. These results indicate that microsomal cytochrome P-450c in primary cultured rat hepatocytes is more stable in culture, in terms of both quantity and activity, than cytochrome P-450d and P-450b/e."

CD008892,0,22993409,1,Evaluation of serological diagnostic tests for typhoid fever in Papua New Guinea using a composite reference standard.,"Typhoid fever remains a major global health problem. A major impediment to improving outcomes is the lack of appropriate diagnostic tools, which have not significantly improved in low-income settings for 100 years. We evaluated two commercially available rapid diagnostic tests (Tubex and TyphiDot), a prototype (TyphiRapid TR-02), and the commonly used single-serum Widal test in a previously reported high-burden area of Papua New Guinea. Samples were collected from 530 outpatients with axillary temperatures of ≥37.5°C, and analysis was conducted on all malaria-negative samples (n = 500). A composite reference standard of blood culture and PCR was used, by which 47 participants (9.4%) were considered typhoid fever positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the Tubex (51.1% and 88.3%, respectively) and TyphiDot (70.0% and 80.1%, respectively) tests were not high enough to warrant their ongoing use in this setting; however, the sensitivity and specificity for the TR-02 prototype were promising (89.4% and 85.0%, respectively). An axillary temperature of ≥38.5°C correlated with typhoid fever (P = 0.014). With an appropriate diagnostic test, conducting typhoid fever diagnosis only on patients with high-grade fever could dramatically decrease the costs associated with diagnosis while having no detrimental impact on the ability to accurately diagnose the illness."

Sixteen mAbs were selected by indirect ELISA using both purified SEF 21 antigen and whole cells of S. enteritidis. Eight mAbs were confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay to react specifically with SEF 21 fimbriae. These mAbs were further characterised for their reactivity patterns by the ""whole cell"" ELISA and latex agglutination test with a number of strains of Salmonella and other enterobacteria. Not all SEF 21 mAbs reacted in both ELISA and latex agglutination tests with whole bacterial cells. mAb 611 was the only one suitable for use in both tests. Unexpectedly these mAbs reacted with the type 1 fimbriae of many of the tested strains of enterobacteria. mAb 721 reacted with most strains of Salmonella (89.1%) and enterobacteria (71.4%) tested. mAb 611 reacted with 61%-75% of strains of Salmonella and with 6.9%-17.6% of enterobacteria in ELISA and latex tests respectively.

High levels of ""normal"" antiribosomal IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies were revealed in the sera of healthy persons while the level of salivary IgA antibodies was very low. In dysentery infection no increase in the levels of serum IgG and IgM antibodies and only a slight increase in the level of IgA antibodies were revealed. Local immune response was manifested by the early (on days 2-4 from the onset of infection) and significant augmentation (12- to 16-fold) of salivary antiribosomal IgA antibodies. An increase in the level of these antibodies was registered in 95-100% of dysentery patients but not in patients with salmonellosis, which made it possible to recommend the method for diagnosing shigellosis.

CD008892,0,14572205,0,Laboratory-based diagnosis of brucellosis--a review of the literature. Part I: Techniques for direct detection and identification of Brucella spp.,"Brucellosis is a world-wide re-emerging zoonosis and the most frequent laboratory-acquired bacterial infection, causing severe disease in humans with unspecific clinical signs affecting numerous organs. Contact with infected animals, ingestion of contaminated animal products and handling of Brucella isolates in laboratories are risk factors. Various other febrile illnesses, e.g. malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and tularemia may present with the same symptoms. Therefore, clinical diagnosis is difficult to establish but effective therapy requires an early diagnosis. Vaccines for humans are still not commercially available. Blood culturing of Brucella is time-consuming and not reliable. Thus diagnosis is usually based on indirect serological tests, i.e. serum agglutination test, complement fixation or the Coombs test. However, these 'conventional' serological tests lack sensitivity and specificity. Hence, a combination of various tests is mandatory for a definite diagnosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays can be used for screening and confirmation of brucellosis in one step. Molecular techniques like the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism are needed to differentiate species and strains within the genus Brucella. This review will summarize advantages and disadvantages of the techniques used in clinical laboratories for direct detection and identification of Brucella spp."

CD008892,0,18078119,0,[An immunoblotting as a method for the diagnosis of typhoid fever].,"The patients' sera had been referred to the National Salmonella Centre for routine Widal serology. Sera were predominately from patients suspected of having been infected with Salmonella Typhi, but also included one serum from patient with typhoid fever who was culture positive for Salmonella Typhi. The immunoblotting procedure using Salmonella Typhi somatic (O=9,12 LPS) and flagellar (H=d) antigens was used for preliminary testing of selected patients sera previously evaluated by Widal agglutination assay as containing different levels of antibodies against O and/or H antigens of Salmonella Typhi. Following Chart et al., immunoblotting reactions were graded between 0 and 3, with 0 indicating an absence of antibody binding, and 3 where antibody binding was readily observed. Sera giving reaction of 2 or 3 were considered to be antibody positive for this study. Positive immunoblotting reaction to O=9,12 LPS antigen was obtained only with the serum of patient with typhoid fever. Presence of specific anti-LPS antibodies was also observed in two other patients' sera diluted 1:50, and in case of one of them also in dilution 1:200, but intensity of antigen-antibody reaction was under positive result criterion. The most other sera positive to O=9,12 antigen in law dilutions (1:50, 1:100) by Widal assay, showed the traces of non-specific reaction by immunoblotting. Presence of positive antigen-antibody reaction was indicated for five sera in dilution 1:50 when tested with the >55 kDa H=d flagellar protein subunit, including the serum of patient with typhoid fever. Only in this serum the high level of specific antibodies was detected also in dilution 1:200, what was not observed in case of the other four, which appeared negative. All the other sera were shown not to contain antibodies to flagella antigen. Although the presented results are preliminary and additional study of more sera of people infected with Salmonella Typhi is needed, it can be concluded after Chart et al., that an immunoblotting procedure incorporating O=9,12 LPS and flagellar H=d antigens is a useful method for providing serological evidence of infection with Salmonella Typhi. In our opinion it can serve as a rapid test for the diagnosis of typhoid fever."

We studied invasive salmonellosis in children at a paediatric hospital in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Between 2007 and 2011 Salmonella was isolated from a blood culture in 162 children. There were 151 children with enteric fever, including 148 serovar Typhi and three serovar Paratyphi A infections, and 11 children with a non-typhoidal Salmonella infection. Of the 148 serovar Typhi isolates 126 (85%) were MDR and 133 (90%) had intermediate ciprofloxacin susceptibility. Inpatient antimicrobial treatment was ceftriaxone alone or initial ceftriaxone followed by a step-down to oral ciprofloxacin or azithromycin. Complications developed in 37/128 (29%) children admitted with enteric fever and two (1.6%) died. There was one confirmed relapse. In a sample of 102 serovar Typhi strains genotyped by investigation of a subset of single nucleotide polymorphisms, 98 (96%) were the H58 haplotype, the majority of which had the common serine to phenylalanine substitution at codon 83 in the DNA gyrase.

Positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (TSB). As blood cultures are often used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of Salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in TSB. Routine blood culture samples from Yonsei Medical Center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of TSB and thiol broth. The media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain CO2, but TSB contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Growth of S. paratyphi-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were similar in both media. However, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in TSB with S. typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

Anti-H. pylori IgG and IgA antibody titres (ELISA) and gastrin concentration (RIA) were determined in the plasma of 87 blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever cases (collected after clinical recovery) and 232 random healthy controls without a history of typhoid fever, in the Jatinegara district, Jakarta. Patients with typhoid fever more often than controls were seropositive for H. pylori IgG (67% vs. 50%, P<0.008), when antibody titres were dichotomized around median titres observed in controls. H. pylori IgA seropositivity was not associated with typhoid fever. Plasma gastrin concentrations indicative of hypochlorhydria (i.e. gastrin > or =25 or > or =100 ng/l) were not significantly elevated in typhoid fever cases compared to controls (P=0.54 and P=0.27 respectively). In a multivariate analysis, typhoid fever was independently associated with young age (<33 years, median age of the controls) [odds ratio (OR) 7.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.90-16.10], and H. pylori IgG seropositivity (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.10-3.40). Typhoid fever was independently associated with H. pylori IgG seropositivity, but not with elevated gastrin concentration. Therefore, the association suggests a common risk of environmental exposure to both bacteria, e.g. poor hygiene, rather than a causal relationship via reduced gastric acid production."

CD008892,0,18402191,0,Adults' perceived prevalence of enteric fever predicts laboratory-validated incidence of typhoid fever in children.,"This study was undertaken to develop a model to predict the incidence of typhoid in children based on adults' perception of prevalence of enteric fever in the wider community. Typhoid cases among children, aged 5-15 years, from epidemic regions in five Asian countries were confirmed with a positive Salmonella Typhi culture of the blood sample. Estimates of the prevalence of enteric fever were obtained from random samples of adults in the same study sites. Regression models were used for establishing the prediction equation. The percentages of enteric fever reported by adults and cases of typhoid incidence per 100,000, detected through blood culture were 4.7 and 24.18 for Viet Nam, 3.8 and 29.20 for China, 26.3 and 180.33 for Indonesia, 66.0 and 454.15 for India, and 52.7 and 407.18 for Pakistan respectively. An established prediction equation was: incidence of typhoid (1/100,000= -2.6946 + 7.2296 x reported prevalence of enteric fever (%) (F=31.7, p<0.01; R2=0.992). Using adults' perception of prevalence of disease as the basis for estimating its incidence in children provides a cost-effective behavioural epidemiologic method to facilitate prevention and control of the disease."

This study investigated the molecular mechanism of β-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance in extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Salmonella enterica serotype Infantis isolated at the 53-bed neonatology ward of University Hospital Benabib in Constantine, Algeria. From September 2008 to January 2009, 200 S. enterica isolates were obtained from 138 patients (age range 8-80 months) hospitalised in the neonatology ward. Most isolates were from stool cultures, but also from two blood cultures and one gastric fluid. The isolates were multidrug-resistant and produced TEM-1 and CTX-M-15 enzymes as well as the 16S RNA methylase ArmA. The armA, bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(TEM-1) genes were located on the same 140-kb self-transferable plasmid belonging to the IncL/M incompatibility group. All of the S. Infantis isolates belonged to a single clone. Increased infection control measures and thorough biodecontamination of the rooms led to control of the outbreak but did not eradicate the epidemic strain. This study further illustrates the global emergence of ArmA methylase and its frequent association with bla(CTX-M) genes. Spread of 16S RNA methylase determinants at the same level as bla(CTX-M) genes in Enterobacteriaceae may seriously compromise the efficacy of aminoglycosides for treating Gram-negative infections."

Bone marrow examination was compatible with infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IAHS). Blood culture showed no growth of bacteria while the culture of bone marrow yielded Salmonella typhi. The clinical condition stabilized shortly after the use of ceftriaxone. This case illustrates that typhoid fever must be included in the differential diagnosis of IAHS. In cases with IAHS, bacterial culture as well as morphological study of bone marrow is necessary for the evaluation of etiological agent and to avoid injudicious use of chemotherapy."

In single-layer hybridization, 3 micrograms of immobilized DNA bound at least 30 fmol of a specific 800-base DNA sequence (equivalent to 8.5 ng, or the amount of that sequence present in 4 X 10(10) organisms). In a 4-h sandwich hybridization protocol, as little as 14 amol (equivalent to 8 pg, or the amount of that sequence present in 1 X 10(7) organisms) of a 1600-base sequence of DNA could be detected. The methods described should be applicable to use with any set of probes--not just from Salmonella--that fulfill the criteria specified. The ability to perform DNA hybridizations on solid-phase matrices such as those used for immunoassay should bring DNA hybridization into the realm of routine clinical laboratory procedures."

Surface localization was verified by immunoblotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The immunogenicity of surface-displayed viral antigens on the recombinant live vaccine strain was assessed in mice inoculated intranasally and intraperitoneally. Inoculation resulted in significantly higher serum antibody level than those induced by viral antigens expressed intracellularly. Thus, this multivalent mucosal live vaccine may provide an effective means for inducing mucosal or systemic immune responses against multiple viral antigens."
CD008892,0,19535522,0,Reliable means of diagnosis and serovar determination of blood-borne Salmonella strains: quick PCR amplification of unique genomic loci by novel primer sets.,"Typhoid fever is becoming an ever increasing threat in the developing countries. We have improved considerably upon the existing PCR-based diagnosis method by designing primers against a region that is unique to Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi A, corresponding to the STY0312 gene in S. Typhi and its homolog SPA2476 in S. Paratyphi A. An additional set of primers amplify another region in S. Typhi CT18 and S. Typhi Ty2 corresponding to the region between genes STY0313 to STY0316 but which is absent in S. Paratyphi A. The possibility of a false-negative result arising due to mutation in hypervariable genes has been reduced by targeting a gene unique to typhoidal Salmonella serovars as a diagnostic marker. The amplified region has been tested for genomic stability by amplifying the region from clinical isolates of patients from various geographical locations in India, thereby showing that this region is potentially stable. These set of primers can also differentiate between S. Typhi CT18, S. Typhi Ty2, and S. Paratyphi A, which have stable deletions in this specific locus. The PCR assay designed in this study has a sensitivity of 95% compared to the Widal test which has a sensitivity of only 63%. As observed, in certain cases, the PCR assay was more sensitive than the blood culture test was, as the PCR-based detection could also detect dead bacteria."

High antibody titres were obtained in CBA and low titres in BALB/C mice after secondary immunisation. A rabbit antiserum raised against S. typhimurium was tested for agglutinating activity after absorption with spleen- and lymph-node cells obtained from unimmunised CBA or BALB/C mice. BALB/C cells consistently removed more anti-S. typhimurium antibodies than did CBA cells, whilst the quantities of Fc receptor-bearing cells were found to be similar in both strains when measured by the erythrocyte-antibody rosette technique. It is suggested BALB/C mice give a low antibody response because their cell-surface antigens crossreact to a greater degree with S. typhimurium than do CBA cell-surface antigens."

The laboratory was jointly established by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) (Manila, The Philippines) and the National Public Health Institute (KTL) (Helsinki, Finland). The laboratory was planned, its personnel were trained, and its functioning was continuously supported by the RITM and KTL. The following aspects were of utmost importance in establishing the laboratory and launching its work: 1) the support of the RITM bacteriologic laboratory, with back-up and consultations from KTL; 2) creation and maintenance of personal contacts between clinicians and laboratory staff with an emphasis on clinical relevance and rapid reporting of laboratory results; 3) the consideration of the quality aspects of the work from the start; and 4) keen follow-up of the bacteriologic results and their clinical significance and use, of practical laboratory work, and of quality assurance aspects. In the first two years of its operation, the laboratory identified Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae as the most important causes of severe pneumonia, sepsis or meningitis in children less than two years of age, and Salmonella typhi as the most frequent significant isolate from the blood cultures, being found most often in school age children and young adults."
CD008892,0,6202289,0,Diagnosis of enteric fever by inhibition assay using peroxidase-labelled monoclonal antibody and Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide.,"An enzyme-linked immunoassay was developed for diagnosing enteric fever. The test measured the inhibition of binding between a labelled, monoclonal IgM antibody and the insolubilized antigen, Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Good discrimination was seen between 32 proven typhoid cases (88.0 +/- 4.4% inhibition) and non-typhoid cases. The latter consisted of 27 febrile patients bacteriologically and serologically (Widal test) found to be negative for typhoid (26.3 +/- 10.8% inhibition), 46 patients screened for syphilis (VDRL test) but found negative (31.2 +/- 13.3% inhibition), and 27 healthy blood donors (44.6 +/- 13.9% inhibition). The test also efficiently detected all 5 known typhoid carriers (90.6 +/- 3.4% inhibition). The antibody binds antigen 9 in the LPS; however, this reaction was inhibited by antibodies directed against both this antigen and an adjacent antigen, 12. Anti-12 antibodies presumably inhibit by steric hindrance and their importance in the test is discussed. Thus, the assay potentially detects (only) those systemic infections caused by salmonellae that possess antigen 9 or 12 (viz. S. typhi and S. paratyphi A)."
CD008892,0,17536687,0,Salmonella diagnosis in pig production: methodological problems in monitoring the prevalence in pigs and pork.,"Salmonellosis is an important foodborne infection in industrialized and developing countries. Especially for human Salmonellosis caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, pigs and pork are the major sources of infection. Mitigation and control strategies that result from surveillance programs attempt to reduce or even eradicate Salmonella in pork to lower consumers' risks. The methodology for Salmonella screening in pigs is generally based on antibody detection at slaughter with meat juice as the sample matrix. The instructions to most commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for the detection of Salmonella antibodies state that their product is suitable for antibody detection in meat juice and sera. In the present study, we show that it is essential to recalculate the percent optical density (OD%) data obtained from meat juice by the ELISA (IDEXX HerdCheck swine Salmonella) by the following regression equation: OD%sera = -70.5587 + 128.1490/ {1 + exp[(-18.8969 - OD%meatjuice)/27.6032]}(1.1771), r = 0.87, to compare results with those obtained from sera. By this regression equation, we were able to compare the Salmonella antibody levels (classified as <10, 10 to <20, 20 to <40, and > or =40 OD%) for sows, growers, and slaughter pigs. We identified significantly higher numbers of growers with lower OD% levels than for sows and slaughter pigs. Without a recalculation of the meat juice results, the higher fraction of samples with low OD% values led to an underestimation of the actual seroprevalence."
CD008892,0,15928444,0,Study of clinical profile and antibiotic response in typhoid fever.,"The objective of the present study is to evaluate the clinical profile and pattern of various drugs used in the treatment of typhoid fever. A retrospective analysis of adult patients suffering from typhoid fever was done at Kasturba Medical College hospital, Attavar during the year 1999-2001. Diagnosis of patients was based on clinical features, widal test and blood culture. The sensitivity pattern of isolates from blood culture was recorded. The mode of presentation, clinical course, treatment history, laboratory investigations reports, antibiotic administered, response to therapy and the complications were recorded. Total number of 44 cases of typhoid fever were studied. Out of these 21(47.7%) were males and 23(52.3%) were females. Average age of presentation was 23.9 years. Average duration of hospital stay was 10.8 days. Fever was present in all patients. Resistance of S. typhi to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole were significantly high. Ciprofloxacin also showed resistance in 18.1% of cases. Sensitivity to cephalosporin was 100% in our study. Ciprofloxacin was the most commonly used antibiotic in our study (23 patients). Chloramphenicol alone was used in 2 patients and in 3 patients it was given after 6 days of ciprofloxacin treatment. Third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone) alone were used in 16 patients. Indiscriminate use of drugs in typhoid fever should be discouraged. Appropriate antibiotic as indicated by sensitivity tests should be employed to prevent the development of resistant strains of S. typhi."

The antigen used was Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide, and the antibody was an O-9-specific monoclonal antibody. Agglutination was indicated by a fall in the turbidimetric measurement compared to control, unagglutinated latex. It was observed that agglutination increased with increasing concentrations of antigen to a maximum at 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml, after which, the amount of agglutination decreased at a similar rate as far as 1 mg/ml of antigen, when no agglutination occurred at all. Thus, a bi-symmetrical curve was obtained, suggestive of a precipitation reaction. At the 'equivalence point', the turbidity of the reaction mixture compared to control fell from OD400 1.1 to OD400 0.3. A similar inhibition of reaction at 'antigen excess' was observed visually in the reaction mixtures. Conventional slide tests performed in parallel could also be inhibited, but at higher antigen levels. Inhibition could be achieved with a commercially available latex used for the detection of Neisseria meningitidis antigen."

CD008892,0,8870619,0,"A novel relationship between O-antigen variation, matrix formation, and invasiveness of Salmonella enteritidis.","Salmonella enterica Enteritidis in chickens serves as a reservoir for salmonellosis in humans and the structure of its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been used to assess invasiveness. Culture from chick spleens generated colonies with an unusual wrinkled morphology, and it is designated the lacy phenotype. The characterize the nature of the morphological change, three isogenic variants were compared. Only the lacy phenotype produced a temperature-dependent cell surface matrix composed of several proteins in association with LPS high molecular weight O-antigen. Flagellin and a 35 kDa protein were identified as specific proteinaceous components of matrix. Both proteins cross-reacted with a monoclonal antibody previously determined to specifically detect the g-epitope of the Enteritidis monophasic flagella (H-antigen). These results suggest that O-antigen in association with protein contributes to cross-reactivity between molecules. The lacy phenotype was more organ invasive in 5-day-old chicks than isogenic variants producing low molecular weight O-antigen. However, it was no more efficient at contaminating eggs after oral inoculation of hens than a variant that completely lacked O-antigen, thus the lacy phenotype is classified as an intermediately invasive organism. The distinctive colonial phenotype of SE6-E21lacy was used to investigate environmental factors that decreased O/C ratios and contributed to attenuation. In so doing, it was found that growth in complement at 46 degrees C caused matrix producing cells to hyperflagellate and migrate across agar surfaces. These results suggest that the structure of O-antigen might influence the secretion and/or the function of Enteritidis cell-surface proteins. The data also reveal a greater heterogeneity than has been assumed in the phenotype, and possibly the infectious behaviour, of Enteritidis."

A total of 44 patients, 22 in each group, were included in the study, and both groups were comparable in terms of baseline parameters. All patients randomized to receive chloramphenicol completed the 14 days of treatment, while two patients randomized to receive aztreonam developed an intestinal hemorrhage, and a third patient elected to withdraw from the trial. Defervescence occurred more quickly in the subjects receiving chloramphenicol than in those receiving aztreonam (P < 0.05). All patients in the chloramphenicol group were clinically cured during therapy, while four patients (21%) in the group receiving aztreonam were declared clinical treatment failures. None of the 19 patients receiving aztreonam, compared with 7 of 22 (32%) patients receiving chloramphenicol, had a positive blood culture after 24 h of therapy (P < 0.05). Adverse experiences were unusual and mild. In the study, aztreonam was less effective than chloramphenicol with regard to clinical effectiveness and time of defervescence but was more effective in the elimination of the infecting Salmonella organisms from the bloodstream."

When L. monocytogenes EGDe (serovar 1/2a) was cultivated in cell-free supernatants obtained from consortia grown for 8 h in liquid medium, a strong bactericidal activity was observed in several cases. The cell-free supernatants of 2 of these consortia (I and II) reduced an initial L. monocytogenes inoculum of 5 × 10(7) cfu/mL to zero after 24 h of incubation. No inhibitory substances could be washed off the complex consortia when incubated for a 10-min period. A taxonomical analysis of the antilisterial consortia I and II using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy yielded a considerable species diversity, with lactic acid bacteria increasing strongly during the 8-h cultivation. Therefore, 23 lactic acid bacteria bacteriocin genes were assayed using specific PCR primers, identifying 3 bacteriocin genes in both microbial communities. However, no transcription of these genes was found on cheese surfaces or in consortia propagated in liquid culture. Individual lactic acid bacteria isolates of consortia I and II displayed no or only weak inhibition of L. monocytogenes on solid medium. The complex cell-free supernatants I and II, in contrast, exhibited an unusually broad inhibitory spectrum, killing L. monocytogenes ssp., Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, as well as gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli DH5α and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Inhibition could not be abolished by heating to 100°C or by proteinase K treatment. Initial purification of an inhibitory substance from consortium I by solid-phase extraction and HPLC indicates the presence of rather small, extremely stable compounds, which, most probably, are not bacteriocins."

In a community-based prospective passive surveillance study, we identified 59 typhoid, 23 paratyphoid fever and 259 non-enteric fever outpatients, all blood culture-confirmed. We compared their symptoms with the aim of developing a clinical prediction rule that may help direct empirical antibiotic treatment to cases with suspected (para)typhoid fever, rather than all febrile patients, or refer patients for additional diagnostic tests. Paratyphoid fever (Salmonella paratyphi A) could not be distinguished clinically from typhoid fever. Decisions on empirical antibiotic treatment and advice on hygiene measures in patients with suspected (para)typhoid fever should take into account chills and absence of cough in the first week of fever and delirium in the second week of illness. This prediction rule increases the likelihood of (para)typhoid fever from 1:10 in the first week to, at most, 2:3 in the second week of a febrile illness. However, we were not able to propose a robust clinical prediction rule that could be used as absolute screening method for decisions on additional diagnostic tests, because of the low sensitivity of presenting symptoms in (para)typhoid fever."

CD008892,0,8539032,0,A rapid method to determine bacterial contamination on hatching eggs. 3. Use of commercial DNA probe kits for detection of specific pathogens after six hours of incubation.,"The usefulness of commercially available DNA probe kits for the detection of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. after only 6 h of incubation, was determined. It was established that the commercially available probe kits used could detect E. coli at initial levels of approximately 4.5 x 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu) per ml after only 6 h of incubation in nutrient broth (NB). Initial bacterial levels as low as 4.5 x 10(1) cfu/ml could be detected when the NB was incubated for 18 h. Salmonella Enteritidis, at initial levels of 2.86 x 10(2) cfu/ml could be detected after 6 h of incubation at 37 degrees C in NB, while initial levels as low as 2.86 x 10(-1) cfu/ml could be detected after 18 h at 37 degrees C in both NB and selected media, as specified by the manufacturers of the probe kits. Commercially available DNA probe kits can therefore be used to detect specific pathogens on the surface of hatching eggs and these probes can be used in conjunction with an egg-washing system, which is used to determine total bacterial contamination, although a longer incubation period greatly improves the sensitivity of these tests."

A holistic view and clinical biochemical reinterpretation.,"A case of a genetically HLA-B27 patient fully investigated by molecular analyses, following a holistic vision and an anamnestic assessment of multi-site ecosystems is repeated. VDRL, Lupus anti-coagulant (LAC) and Widal-Wright (WWR), resulted positive. The antibodies (IgG/IgA anti-Ct) against chronic Chlamydia trachomatis inflammation were positive. In the context of all the enzymatic activities in reference range, the AMS and the ALP enzymatic activities showed an increasing trend and a time course augment depending respectively. Cultures, parasitological, digestibility tests and molecular analyses were then performed to investigate the different human ecosystems. Parasitological research and digestibility test were performed, resulting a latent chronic bowel inflammation, including certain enteroinvasive pathogens, such as, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia and Campylobacter (Enteric Pathogens Group, EPG) and Escherichia Coli pathogens (Escherichia Coli Pathogens Group, ECPG). The Salmonella typhi-DNA resulted positive, while 90% of the total microbic charge (TMC) was represented by C. freundi in culture analyses. Interpreting the VDRL positive test as early triggering of autoimmune disease, a few acute phase proteins as a pauci-symptomatic chronic phlogistic process, the amylase and alkaline phosphatase alterations as tissue markers of early intestinal inflammation, the Widal's reaction positivity together with the precocious clinical and faecal manifestations, this study suggests the prime triggering role of these atypical pathogens to cause a chronic low grade autoimmune response against the tissue/organ susceptible target, causing inflammaging phenomenon in young patient with chronic latent infection by Salmonella typhi, leading to Reiter's syndrome, in HLA-B27 positive patient."
CD008892,0,22839649,0,A novel method of selective removal of human DNA improves PCR sensitivity for detection of Salmonella Typhi in blood samples.,"Enteric fever is a major public health problem, causing an estimated 21million new cases and 216,000 or more deaths every year. Current diagnosis of the disease is inadequate. Blood culture only identifies 45 to 70% of the cases and is time-consuming. Serological tests have very low sensitivity and specificity. Clinical samples obtained for diagnosis of enteric fever in the field generally have <1 organism/ml of blood, so that even PCR-based methods, widely used for detection of other infectious diseases, are not a straightforward option in typhoid diagnosis. We developed a novel method to enrich target bacterial DNA by selective removal of human DNA from blood samples, enhancing the sensitivity of PCR tests. This method offers the possibility of improving PCR assays directly using clinical specimens for diagnosis of this globally important infectious disease."

A 63-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cerebral infarction was seen elsewhere for a 40 degrees C fever, vomiting, and shaking on day 1 after onset. He was diagnosed with Salmonella bacteremia and hospitalized by us for intensive care. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound imaging did not, however, show critical findings of aneurysm, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis, and laboratory testing suggest significant inflammatory symptoms. He did not respond to antibiotics, but had an intermittent low fever during the first hospitalization. On day 48 after onset during the second hospitalization, abdominal CT showed an aneurysm -3 cm in diameter in the thoracoabdominal aorta above the renal artery- small enough to have been missed in earlier diagnosis. Surgery and TAAA graft replacement were done on day 64. Bacterial culture of the graft showed no Salmonella growth due to long-term in vivo antibiotic exposure. He recovered without significant complications, with oral ciprofloxacin antibiotic therapy continued to the present. This case indicates the importance of an early diagnosis through continuous blood culture and imaging for Salmonella sp blood stream infection."

Disruption of such secretion systems is a potentially effective therapeutic strategy. We developed a high-throughput screen and identified a tris-aryl substituted 2-imino-5-arylidenethiazolidin-4-one, compound 1, as an inhibitor of the type III secretion system. Expansion of this chemotype enabled us to define the essential pharmacophore for type III secretion inhibition by this structural class. A synthetic diversity set helped us identify N-3 as the most permissive locus and led to the design of a panel of novel N-3-dipeptide-modified congeners with improved activity and physiochemical properties. We now report on the synthesis of these compounds, including a novel solid phase approach to the rapid generation of the dipeptide-thiazolidinone hybrids, and their in vitro characterization as inhibitors of type III secretion in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium."

Although H1-j strains (one of the flagellar antigen variants) account for 10 to 50% of S. enterica serotype Typhi strains found in Indonesia, there have been no published data to suggest its existence in other parts of the world. We describe a case of typhoid fever associated with acute appendicitis caused by an S. enterica serotype Typhi H1-j strain in a Chinese woman in Hong Kong. A gram-negative, motile rod was recovered from her blood and stool cultures. Conventional biochemical tests and the Vitek system (GNI+) showed that the bacterium was S. enterica serotype Typhi. The isolate agglutinated with poly(O), 9O, Vi and H1-j Salmonella antisera but not with poly(H) antisera. The patient developed antibodies against only S. enterica serotype Typhi O antigens but not against H1-d antigen by the Widal test. Flagellin C gene (fliC) sequencing showed a 261-bp deletion in the fliC gene of the isolate, confirming that the isolate possessed the H1-j antigen. The patient had no past history of travel to Indonesia or personal contact with any Indonesian. She recovered with appendectomy and antibiotic treatment.

Traditional approaches such as culture-based methods have good sensitivity and specificity, but they tend to be tedious and time-consuming. Herein we present a simple and sensitive aptamer based biosensor for rapid detection of Salmonella enteritidis (S. enteritidis). One of the aptamers specific for the outmembrane of S. enteritidis was used for magnetic bead enrichments. Another aptamer against S. enteritidis was used as a reporter for this pathogen, which was amplified by isothermal strand displacement amplification (SDA) and further detected by a lateral flow biosensor. As low as 10(1) colony forming unit (CFU) of S. enteritidis was detected in this study. Without DNA extraction, the reduced handling and simpler equipment requirement render this assay a simple and rapid alternative to conventional methods."

Serologic diagnosis of S. enteritidis infection in commercial flocks currently relies on laboratory-based tests for detection of antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide, whole flagella, and bacteria. We amplified a sequence from the g,m flagellin of S. enteritidis, followed by cloning, expression, and purification of the protein. The recombinant protein was first characterized by western blot and subsequently evaluated as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen for detection of S. enteritidis infection. A total number of 49 positive sera and 40 negative sera were tested for ELISA validation. A cutoff value of 0.14 was shown to be sufficient to discriminate the negative and positive sera. Results obtained by testing sera raised against different bacterial strains/serotypes further confirmed that this recombinant flagellin-based ELISA was indeed specific for the detection of S. enteritidis. Both sensitivity and specificity of the developed ELISA test were comparable with a commercially available test, indicating that it is a highly promising and reliable diagnostic tool for S. enteritidis infection."

Purified S. typhi Vi polysaccharide was biotinylated and bound to streptavidin coated microtitre plates. Reproducibility was determined across a range of IgG antibody levels: mean interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) were <11.9% for non-vaccinated sera with low levels and <11.1% for sera with very high levels of anti-S. typhi Vi IgG. Specificity was assessed by inhibition studies using salmonella antigen. We have developed the ELISA based on normal adult serum responses to test immunization with S. typhi Vi vaccine. We also report here anti-S. typhi Vi IgG levels in a group of healthy preschool children. In non-vaccinated adult sera (n = 104), the median value of anti-S. typhi Vi IgG, expressed in S. typhi Vi arbitrary units (AU/ml), was 5.3 AU/ml and in non-vaccinated sera from children (n = 44) the median value was 1.4 AU/ml. The data from immunization of healthy volunteers (n = 23) show that geometric mean levels of anti-S. typhi Vi IgG were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) for post-vaccination subjects (39.2 AU/ml) compared to paired prevaccination (3.9 AU/ml) values. A total of 21/23 vaccine recipients had <8 AU/ml S. typhi Vi IgG in their sera prior to vaccination and of these 20/21 (95%) exhibited threefold increases and 14/21 (67%) fourfold increases in their S. typhi Vi IgG following vaccination. Based on the data in this study, we propose a threefold increase in anti-S. typhi Vi IgG post-vaccination to be considered a positive vaccination response. The ability to demonstrate clearly an antibody rise in response to immunization with S. typhi Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine suggests that this is likely to be a useful vaccine for the assessment of B cell function in patients with suspected immune deficiency."

Activated microglia produce nitric oxide (NO), a major toxin to neuronal cells. It has been reported that astrocytes inhibit microglial activation. In this study, we found that wortmannin, a natural inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, significantly increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO release and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in microglia in the presence but not in the absence of astrocytes. In response to LPS even in the presence of wortmannin, iNOS immunoreactivity was detected in microglia but not in astrocytes. These results suggest that astrocytes could regulate microglia-mediated brain inflammation by inhibiting microglial NO release/iNOS expression via a wortmannin-sensitive mechanism."

The indirect fluorescent antibody test, using a Salmonella typhi Vi antigen and a FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human polyvalent immunoglobulin, was evaluated for the diagnosis of typhoid fever. Serum specimens were collected from patients with febrile diseases on admission. Of the 32 patients with titers of 1:64 or more, 22 were confirmed to have typhoid fever by blood culture and 7 had fever of undetermined origin that was considered to be typhoid fever clinically. Three patients were diagnosed to have salmonellosis other than typhoid fever.

Specificity for the 3,6-dideoxy-D-xylo-hexose (3,6-dideoxy-D-galactose) epitope present in Salmonella paratyphi B O-antigens was ensured by screening hybridoma experiments with glycoconjugates derived from synthetic oligosaccharides. Detailed epitope mapping of the molecular recognition by modified and monodeoxy oligosaccharide derivatives showed that complementary surfaces and three antibody-saccharide hydrogen bonds are essential for full binding activity. Both hydroxyl groups of the 3,6-dideoxy-D-galactose residue were obligatory for binding and consistent with the directional nature of their involvement in carbohydrate-protein hydrogen bonds; related tetrasaccharides built from the isomeric 3,6-dideoxyhexoses, 3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose, paratose, and 3,6-dideoxy-D-mannose, tyvelose were not bound by the antibody. Titration microcalorimetry measurements were consistent with the hydrogen-bonding map inferred from the crystal structure and suggest that the displacement of water molecules from the binding site accounts for the favorable entropy that accompanies binding of the native trisaccharide determinant. The protein sequences determined for the antibody VL and VH domains reveal somatic mutation of the VL germ line gene, implying that this antibody-binding site results from a mature antibody response."

This disease remains frequent and even severe in tropical zone where its evolution is of endemoepidemic type. Established fever, in spite of an appropriate treatment, is one of the main features of this disease. A certain number of clinical signs call for it; although classical, some others are less significant. Complications are frequent, without any correlation between the date of hospitalizing and the beginning of the disease. They are sometimes severe but mortality rate during hospitalization is quite low. Leukoneutropenia and thrombopenia are both exceptional. Blood culture and serology are always the background of any diagnosis, the latter appearing to the authors much more valuable than the former. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprime is an antibiotic to be recommended in first instance. Precocity of treatment has no influence on the time of apyrexia is appearing. If hopes put on oral vaccine could be confirmed, so it might be used on a large scale for children living in endemia zones."

CD008892,0,9453599,0,"Prevalence of the ""high-pathogenicity island"" of Yersinia species among Escherichia coli strains that are pathogenic to humans.","The fyuA-irp gene cluster contributes to the virulence of highly pathogenic Yersinia (Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica 1B). The cluster encodes an iron uptake system mediated by the siderophore yersiniabactin and reveals features of a pathogenicity island. Two evolutionary lineages of this ""high pathogenicity island"" (HPI) can be distinguished on the basis of DNA sequence comparison: a Y. pestis group and a Y. enterocolitica group. In this study we demonstrate that the HPI of the Y. pestis evolutionary group is disseminated among species of the family Enterobacteriaceae which are pathogenic to humans. It prevails in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and in E. coli blood culture isolates (93 and 80%, respectively), but is rarely found in enteropathogenic E. coli, enteroinvasive E. coli, and enterotoxigenic E. coli isolates. In contrast, the HPI was absent from enterohemorrhagic E. coli, Shigella, and Salmonella enterica strains investigated. Polypeptides encoded by the fyuA, irp1, and irp2 genes located on the HPI could be detected in E. coli strains pathogenic to humans. However, these E. coli strains showed a reduced sensitivity to the bacteriocin pesticin, whose uptake is mediated by the FyuA receptor. Escherichia strains do not possess the hms gene locus thought to be a part of the HPI of Y. pestis. Deletions of the juA-irp gene cluster affecting solely the fyuA part of the HPI were identified in 3% of the E. coli strains tested. These results suggest horizontal transfer of the HPI between Y. pestis and some pathogenic E. coli strains."

At each farm, samples were taken from the sedimentation basin (SB), the solid fraction (SF), and the liquid fraction (LF). For each sample, CFU/g for enteric bacteria were quantified; Salmonella spp. were isolated and typified. Solid phase samples from each farm were used to prepare the ensilage, with a mixture of solids (80%), sorghum (12%) and molasses (8%). The quantity of enteric bacteria was significantly greater in farms without PCED (P < 0.05). Salmonella enterica were isolated from 8/10 of the farms with and without PCED; in 8 from SB; in 6 from LF; and in 5 from SF. Enteric bacteria were not isolated from silage, therefore, ensilage may be an alternative treatment for excreta that allows the elimination of pathogens such as Salmonella spp."

We conducted a prospective community-based study in an impoverished urban site in Kolkata, India, to estimate the burden of malaria and typhoid fever and to identify risk factors for these diseases. In a population of 60452 people, 3605 fever episodes were detected over a 12-month period. The blood films of 93 febrile patients contained Plasmodium (90 P. vivax, 2 P. falciparum and 1 P. malariae). Blood cultures from 95 patients grew Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. Malaria patients were found to be significantly older (mean age 29 years) compared with patients with typhoid fever (15 years; P<0.001) but had similar clinical features on presentation. Having a household member with malaria, illiteracy, low household income and living in a structure not built of bricks were associated with an increased risk for malaria. Having a household member with typhoid fever and poor hygiene were associated with typhoid fever. A geographic analysis of the spatial distribution of malaria and typhoid fever cases detected high-risk neighbourhoods for each disease. Focal interventions to minimise human-vector contact and improved personal hygiene and targeted vaccination campaigns could help to prevent malaria and typhoid fever in this site."

Titres of 1:200 or greater for either H or O agglutinins were recorded for 75,2% of patients with bacteriologically proven typhoid fever, 4,6% of healthy subjects residing in an endemic area and 7,5% of patients presenting with non-thyroid fevers. Age, sex and region were found to affect the percentage of positive tests recorded. Despite these failings, the Widal test was found to be of value in the diagnosis of typhoid fever. The concept of a diagnostic titre was considered unreliable, but considered in conjunction with the clinical picture, O or H agglutinin titres of 1:200 or more may be regarded as strong presumptive evidence of typhoid fever."

CD008892,0,16734611,0,PARK2/PACRG polymorphisms and susceptibility to typhoid and paratyphoid fever.,"Host genetic factors may contribute to susceptibility to and outcome in infectious diseases. Recently polymorphisms in PARK2/PACRG, a gene cluster linked to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated protein degradation, were found to be associated with manifest infection by M. leprae. Here, we address whether these polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to infection with Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A, intracellular pathogens that upon infection of humans share with mycobacteria aspects of the hosts' immune response. The polymorphisms of PARK_e01(-697), PARK2_e01(-2599), rs1333955 and rs1040079 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism in a case-control study of typhoid and paratyphoid fever patients in an endemic area in Jakarta, Indonesia. For this study, samples were obtained from patients with blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever (n=90), paratyphoid fever (n=26) and fever controls (n=337) in a passive, community-based surveillance and compared to those of randomly selected community controls (n=322) from the same city area. The PARK2_e01(-2599) allele T was significantly associated with typhoid and paratyphoid fever (OR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.02-2.23) but the other polymorphisms, PARK2_e01(-697), rs1333955 and rs1040079, were not associated. Although within the PARK2/PACRG gene cluster the PARK2_e01(-2599) allele T was most strongly associated with leprosy (OR approximately 3-5), the association with typhoid is much less strong. Our findings suggest that this polymorphism in PARK2/PACRG plays a small but significant role in susceptibility to the intracellular pathogens S. typhi and S. paratyphi."

The antibodies were determined by the standard Widal test while the leucocyte migration test was used for CMIR. These immunological parameters were correlated with the duration of illness, the duration of chloramphenicol therapy and the severity of the illness. It was found that CMIR appeared after the first week of illness in uncomplicated cases of typhoid fever, where as it remained negative in the patients who had complications. The antibody titres were similar in the two groups. On further follow up of complicated cases, the clinical recovery coincided with the development of CMIR. It may be concluded that for recovery in typhoid fever CMIR is more important than antibodies."

Two pairs of oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify a 343-bp fragment of the flagellin gene of S. typhi. Amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization by using a 32P-labeled 40-base probe internal to the amplified DNA. The nested PCR with two pairs of primers could detect 10 organisms of S. typhi as determined by serial dilutions of DNA from S. typhi. The peripheral mononuclear cells from 11 of 12 patients with typhoid fever confirmed by blood culture were positive for DNA fragment of the flagellin gene of S. typhi, whereas 10 blood specimens of patients with other febrile diseases were negative. With the nested PCR, S. typhi DNAs were detected from blood specimens of four patients with suspected typhoid fever on the basis of clinical features but with negative cultures. We suggest that the PCR technique could be used as a novel diagnostic method of typhoid fever, particularly in culture-negative cases."

Under the hypothesis that agglutinins response (Widal test) is a suitable phenotype for this objective, associations between results of this response at admission (positive and negative) and clinical and hematological variables were explored in 91 children with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid fever, admitted to a metropolitan hospital at Santiago, Chile, during 1981-82 period. Association between gender and negative Widal test was found in males when this test was performed during the third week of disease (OR = 10, p = 0.52) as well as a tendency of females to express figures below the mean for total WBC count in patients older than 10 years (OR = 2.43, p = 0.019) and for neutrophils (%) in younger than this age when the Widal test was negative in the latter (OR = 10, p = 0.016).

A total of 30 blood culture-proven typhoid fever patients (cases) were matched to 60 patients confirmed as not having typhoid fever (controls) by age, sex, race and severity of illness on admission. Features significantly associated with a final diagnosis of typhoid fever were: a pre-admission duration of fever > or = 7 days (odds ratio (OR) 6.9); hepatomegaly (OR 3.2); a normal leucocyte count (OR 10.8); a leucocyte count of < 10.0 x 10(3)/mm3 (OR 30.2); and leucopenia due to absolute neutropenia with a relative lymphocytosis (OR 11.8). Although the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of any of these features cannot be used reliably to distinguish typhoid fever from other non-typhoidal febrile illness, it is concluded that leucopenia due to absolute neutropenia with relative lymphocytosis, when present, is highly suggestive of typhoid fever. A leucocyte count of > 10.0 x 10(3)/mm3 (OR 0.03) provides strong presumptive evidence against such a diagnosis."

Enteritidis occurred in Uruguay, and to evaluate the extent of poultry contamination, we conducted a nationwide survey over 2 years that included the analysis of sera from 5,751 birds and 12,400 eggs. Serological evidence of infection with Salmonella group O:9 was found in 24.4% of the birds. All positive sera were retested with a gm flagellum-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and based on these results, the national prevalence of S. Enteritidis infection was estimated to be 6.3%. Salmonellae were recovered from 58 of 620 pools made up of 20 eggs each, demonstrating a prevalence of at least 1 in every 214 eggs. Surprisingly, the majority of the isolates were not S. Enteritidis. Thirty-nine isolates were typed as S. Derby, 9 as S. Gallinarum, 8 as S. Enteritidis, and 2 as S. Panama. Despite the highest prevalence in eggs, S. Derby was not isolated from humans in the period of analysis, suggesting a low capacity to infect humans. Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis of S. Derby and S. Enteritidis revealed more than 350 genetic differences. S. Derby lacked pathogenicity islands 13 and 14, the fimbrial lpf operon, and other regions encoding metabolic functions. Several of these regions are present not only in serovar Enteritidis but also in all sequenced strains of S.

Their ages ranged between 4-23 (12 +/- 2.5) years. Male: Female ratio was 1:1. Three of the 4 classical signs namely: toxic look (84%), bronchitic chest (47%), tumid tympanitic abdomen (84%) and just palpable receding spleen (69%) were found in almost all cases and offer a good bed side clinical diagnostic test. Blood picture revealed anaemia, within normal white blood count and thrombocytopenia. Liver function tests showed within normal total serum bilirubin, two or more folds increase of ALT and within normal serum alkaline phosphatase. Comparing the 3 tests, namely significant Widal titre (56%), modified Widal test (89%) and bright spleen (78%), it was found that modified Widal test is the most sensitive serological test. Ultrasonographic finding of bright spleen is an easy, safe, noninvasive and sensitive technique which is relatively cheap. Each of the 3 drugs in our study namely chloramphenicol, quinolones and ceftriaxone resulted in improvement of general condition, drop of fever, increase in haemoglobin, white blood count and platelet count. Also, there was a significant improvement of liver function tests by either of the 3 drugs.

Circulating PLA2 concentrations were measured in 12 typhoid fever patients on various days after admission and after recovery. On admission, mean concentrations of PLA2 were elevated (1444 +/- 1560 ng/mL) and decreased gradually and significantly to day 14 (55 +/- 48 ng/mL). patients with complicated disease had significantly higher PLA2 levels on admission. PLA2 was not produced in a lipopolysaccharide-stimulated whole blood culture, indicating that PLA2 originates from other types of cells.

Staph. aureus ranks first in most centres for 1983 but is displaced in some in 1984 by enteric Gram-negative bacilli. In Durban S. typhi is the most common isolate for the entire period. Methicillin resistance among Staph. aureus is common (approximately 30% overall), especially in the Transvaal. Gentamicin resistance among certain Gram-negative bacilli is a problem in many centres and is especially disturbing in the case of Klebsiella spp., of which over 30% of total isolates are resistant.

In an immunoblot assay with whole cell lysate proteins from the infecting virulent Yersinia strain, a significant IgG response was evident in convalescent-sera of v-rabbits and of av-rabbits, demonstrating that all rabbits seroconverted. However, v-rabbits mounted a stronger immune response to the cell lysate proteins than av-rabbits and the immune response persisted for a longer time. The post-challenge sera also reacted with whole cell lysate proteins of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, indicating cross-reactivity between the different members of Enterobacteriaceae. In contrast, the antibody response against plasmid-encoded released proteins (RPs) appeared specific for infection with virulent strains in that the sera of av-rabbits failed to recognize the plasmid-encoded proteins. Six days following challenge with the virulent Yersinia strain all animals mounted a serum IgM and IgA response to RPs, followed by IgG antibodies on day 9. While the IgM and IgA serum antibody response rapidly decreased (within five-seven and eight-ten months, respectively), IgG antibodies to RPs were still present one year after challenge. Fourteen months after the first infection both the av-rabbits and the v-rabbits were reinfected with the virulent Yersinia strain and the antibody response to RPs was monitored. The v-rabbits only responded with a significant increase of IgG antibodies, indicating that they were primed to the RPs whereas the av-rabbits produced IgM, IgA and IgG specific antibodies like those seen in the primary response of v-rabbits. This study indicates that the rabbit model is helpful and adequate to analyse the character and kinetics of the antibody response during Yersinia infection."

Alfalfa sprouts were inoculated with S. typhimurium, packed into commercial LDPE bags and stored at 10+2 degrees C for 0, 1, 2 and 3 days. Uninoculated sprouts were used as control samples. A SPME device was used to collect the volatiles from the headspace above the samples and the volatiles were identified using GC/MS. Chemometric techniques including linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used as data processing tools. Numbers of Salmonella were followed using a colony counting method. From LDA, it was able to differentiate control samples from sprouts contaminated with S. typhimurium. The potential to predict the number of contaminated S. typhimurium from the SPME/GC/MS data was investigated using multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network with back propagation training. The MLP comprised an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer, with a hyperbolic tangent sigmoidal transfer function in the hidden layer and a linear transfer function in the output layer.

Over 100 years since its introduction as a serologic means of detecting the presence of typhoid fever, the Widal test continues to be plagued with controversies involving the quality of the antigens used and interpretation of the result, particularly in endemic areas. Areas of concern with clinical and laboratory significance discussed in this review include: the techniques of test performance, interpretation of results, limitation of the value of the test results in endemic typhoid areas, the quality of the antigens used, and alternative diagnostic tests."
CD008892,0,25624745,0,Successful endoscopic hemoclipping of massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding from paratyphoid A fever.,"Paratyphoid fever can be complicated by massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding with ileocolonic ulcerations, which are commonly localized using colonoscopy. The most common manifestations include multiple, variable-sized, round or oval-shaped, punched-out ulcers. Occasionally, massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding can occur from erosion of blood vessels. We present a rare case of severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to paratyphoid A fever that was successfully controlled with hemoclippings. A 30-year-old man experienced high fever and hematochezia whose blood culture showed Salmonella paratyphi A. A complete colonoscopy was successfully performed up to the level of the terminal ileum, which showed multiple, shallow, ulcerated lesions over the entire terminal ileum. A bleeding vessel was seen in one of the ulcers, with overlaying blood clots. Endoscopic hemostasis was successfully performed with four pieces of endoclip and without immediate complication. This report highlights the use of colonoscopy and endoscopic therapy with endoclips for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which should be considered before surgery."
CD008892,0,9012444,0,The oxidative burst triggered by Salmonella typhimurium in differentiated U937 cells requires complement and a complete bacterial lipopolysaccharide.,"The bacterial and serum factors involved in the oxidative response triggered by Salmonella typhimurium in differentiated U937 cells were investigated. Complement activation was shown to be required, using sera deficient in complement factors. An original dot-blot technique was developed to study the activation of complement by either bacteria or purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both O-specific and lipid A segments of LPS were found to play a role in the triggering of the oxidative response. Lipid A was responsible for bacterial C3-derived opsonization by inducing an antibody-independent activation of complement classical pathway, whereas O-specific polysaccharide chains (O-Ag) were involved in cellular activation. Inhibition experiments using anti-cell surface marker monoclonal antibodies showed the involvement of the alpha chain of CR3 (CD11b) in the oxidative response developed by differentiated U937 cells in response to S. typhimurium infection. Whether both iC3b and O-Ag interact with different domains of CR3 or whether the binding of O-Ag occurs via a not yet identified receptor remains to be determined."
CD008892,0,8849259,0,Two or three days of ofloxacin treatment for uncomplicated multidrug-resistant typhoid fever in children.,"An open randomized comparison of 2 days (Ofx2) versus 3 days (Ofx3) of oral ofloxacin treatment (15 mg/kg/day) was conducted with Vietnamese children between 1 and 15 years of age with suspected typhoid fever. Of 108 children enrolled, 100 were blood culture positive for Salmonella typhi, and 86% of the isolates were multidrug resistant. There were no significant adverse effects. The therapeutic responses were similar in both groups, with mean (+/- standard deviation) fever clearances of 107 +/- 60 h in the Ofx3 group and 100 +/- 64 h in the Ofx2 group (P > 0.2). There were six ""clinical"" failures in the Ofx2 group and two clinical failures in the Ofx3 group (P > 0.2), in which fever and symptoms persisted for more than 1 week after the start of treatment, but only one of these was culture positive (Ofx3). There was one suspected relapse, and one carrier was identified. Short courses of ofloxacin are simple, inexpensive, safe, and effective for the treatment of uncomplicated multidrug-resistant typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,2617639,1,Evaluation in Papua New Guinea of a urine coagglutination test and a Widal slide agglutination test for rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever.,"Two simple rapid tests for the laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever were evaluated, a coagglutination test for detecting Salmonella typhi antigens in urine and a Widal slide agglutination for detecting serum antibodies. Ninety-two culture-confirmed typhoid cases were compared with 64 non-typhoid fever patients, 50 close contacts of typhoid patients, 30 vaccinated staff and 72 healthy community members. A strong urine Vi coagglutination was found to be 86.5% sensitive and 91.8% specific for typhoid, but was not always easy to read. The slide Widal H was found to be 99% sensitive and 95% specific whereas the slide Widal O was 98% sensitive and 98% specific. These data suggest that a single slide Widal O, at a reciprocal titre of 40, is the most suitable rapid test for the diagnosis of typhoid in a population with low typhoid antibody levels in the community, few other cross-reacting Salmonella infections, and a tendency for patients to present late in the infection."

The diagnosis was made by ultrasound except in the patients with complications, who were diagnosed at laparotomy. Salmonella typhi was cultured in the bile and blood in 2 cases and the Widal titre was significantly elevated in 4 others. One child had chronic blockage of the cystic duct by a lymph node; in 9 there was no identifiable cause. Open cholecystectomy was successfully performed in 15 cases, while 1 child was managed non-operatively. The need for early diagnosis of cholecystitis in children is obvious if the potentially life-threatening complications of perforation and gangrene are to be avoided."
CD008892,0,22701301,0,Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SV4089 as a potential carrier of oral DNA vaccine in chickens.,"Attenuated Salmonella has been used as a carrier for DNA vaccine. However, in vitro and in vivo studies on the bacteria following transfection of plasmid DNA were poorly studied. In this paper, eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H5N1 genes, pcDNA3.1/HA, NA, and NP, were transfected into an attenuated Salmonella enteric typhimurium SV4089. In vitro stability of the transfected plasmids into Salmonella were over 90% after 100 generations. The attenuated Salmonella were able to invade MCF-7 (1.2%) and MCF-10A (0.5%) human breast cancer cells. Newly hatched specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks were inoculated once by oral gavage with 10(9) colony-forming unit (CFU) of the attenuated Salmonella. No abnormal clinical signs or deaths were recorded after inoculation. Viable bacteria were detected 3 days after inoculation by plating from spleen, liver, and cecum. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were carried out for confirmation. Salmonella was not detected in blood cultures although serum antibody immune responses to Salmonella O antiserum group D1 factor 1, 9, and 12 antigens were observed in all the inoculated chickens after 7 days up to 35 days. Our results showed that live attenuated S. typhimurium SV4089 harboring pcDNA3.1/HA, NA, and NP may provide a unique alternative as a carrier for DNA oral vaccine in chickens."

Salmonella typhi was isolated from 45 patients but all had a significant rise of Widal agglutinin titres during the course of the disease. Decrease in G-6-PD activity of the red blood cells was found in 37 out of 51 patients tested. A daily dose of 6--10 mg of trimethoprim plus 30--50 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kg body weight was given for 14 days. Patients with G-6-PD deficiency were closely observed for evidence of intravascular hemolysis. All patients responded well and the mean period of defervescence after starting therapy was approximately 8 days. One patient with G-6-PD deficiency developed acute hemolysis on the second day of medication. The hemolytic symptoms subsided within 14 days with the continuation of co-trimoxazole therapy. No other major side-effect of the drug was observed. It is concluded that co-trimoxazole can be used successfully in the treatment of typhoid fever in G-6-PD deficient children with little risk of serious adverse reaction.

CD008892,0,9585266,0,"Modulation of 2,6-dinitrotoluene genotoxicity by alachlor treatment of Fischer 344 rats.","Due to its widespread use as a preemergent herbicide, alachlor has been detected as a groundwater contaminant. The procarcinogen, 2,6-dinitrotoluene (DNT), a by-product of the munitions industry and a precursor to polyurethane production, is found in the manufacturing waste stream. This study explores the effect of alachlor treatment on the bioactivation of DNT by examining urine mutagenicity, intestinal enzymes, and hepatic DNA adducts to detect changes in metabolism. Five-week-old male rats were treated daily by gavage with 50 mg/kg of alachlor for up to 5 weeks while control animals received an equal volume of peanut oil. At 1, 3, and 5 weeks following the initial alachlor dose, animals were administered p.o. 75 mg/kg DNT or DMSO. Urine was collected for 24 hr in metabolism cages. Following incubation with sulfatase and beta-glucuronidase, urines were individually concentrated by C-18 solid phase extraction, dried under N2, and prepared for bioassay in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 with and without metabolic activation. Urine from peanut oil- and alachlor-treated rots was not mutagenic. Even though calf thymus DNA-alachlor adducts formed in vitro, no hepatic DNA adducts were detected in vivo in these two treatment groups. Interestingly, a significant increase in excretion of mutagenic urine from DNT-treated rats was observed following 3 weeks of alachlor treatment in the absence of S9 (690 +/- 130 vs. 339 +/- 28 revertants/ml) which corresponded to increased DNT-related hepatic DNA adduct formation (5.90 +/- 0.88 adducts/10(8) nucleotides vs. 10.56 x +/- 0.59 adducts/10(8) nucleotides [relative adduct level (RAL)]). Elevation in the production of mutagenic urine from control and treated animals was linked to increases in intestinal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities; however, the only significant alachlor-related effects were an increase in small intestinal 1-week beta-glucuronidase and 5-week dehydrochlorinase activities. The increased urine mutagenicity and hepatic DNA adduct formation indicates that alachlor has a transient effect on DNT bioactivation that apparently is unrelated to intestinal bioactivation."
CD008892,0,2600428,0,Enhancement of the antigen-binding capacity of incomplete IgG antibodies to Brucella melitensis through Fc region interactions with staphylococcal protein A.,"Incomplete IgG anti-Brucella antibodies in human sera were detected using both a conventional ELISA and a modified method. In the ELISA procedure serum IgG was allowed to bind solid-phase B. melitensis antigen and, after washing, biotinylated staphylococcal protein A (BioSPA) was used as an Fc-specific tracer followed by streptavidin-HRP conjugate. In the modified method, serum IgG was co-incubated with a defined quantity of BioSPA in the presence of solid-phase antigen. BioSPA bound Fc regions of serum IgG irrespective of antigen specificity whilst antibodies which were specific for Brucella bound the solid-phase antigen through their Fab regions and were detected subsequently by streptavidin-HRP. IgG anti-Brucella antibodies were detectable with a 5-25-fold increase in sensitivity when they were thus 'activated' in situ with BioSPA. In contrast with the IgG antibodies of untreated human sera, BioSPA-activated IgG showed strong antigen binding capacity and resisted the dissociation effect of the chaotropic agent, guanidine hydrochloride. In similar experiments, BioSPA did not enhance the affinity of IgG anti-Salmonella antibodies of human sera towards S. typhi antigen. The activating effect of BioSPA on the incomplete IgG anti-Brucella antibodies from patients with brucellosis possibly involves a re-orientation of Fab sites."

We also examined the interaction between LPS and aluminum hydroxide gel for endotoxin activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses of whole bovine blood. Alteration in the mRNA concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-10 in whole-blood culture at 4h after stimulation with different doses of LPS was observed and determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The mRNA concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β changed in a dose-dependent manner and differed depending on the type of LPS. Limulus test revealed that endotoxin activity was remarkably reduced when aluminum hydroxide gel was added to LPS. In contrast, the mRNA concentration of TNF-α in whole bovine blood was enhanced by LPS mixed with aluminum hydroxide gel. These results suggest that bovine whole-blood culture can be utilized to detect endotoxin activity of Gram-negative bacterial vaccines. In addition, whole-blood culture offers several advantages, such as ease of performance, few preparation artifacts, and a physiological cell environment, for investigating bovine immune response compared with the Limulus test."
CD008892,0,21983341,0,Escherichia coli peptide binding protein OppA has a preference for positively charged peptides.,"The Escherichia coli peptide binding protein OppA is an essential component of the oligopeptide transporter Opp. Based on studies on its orthologue from Salmonella typhimurium, it has been proposed that OppA binds peptides between two and five amino acids long, with no apparent sequence selectivity. Here, we studied peptide binding to E. coli OppA directly and show that the protein has an unexpected preference for basic peptides. OppA was expressed in the periplasm, where it bound to available peptides. The protein was purified in complex with tightly bound peptides. The crystal structure (up to 2.0 Å) of OppA liganded with the peptides indicated that the protein has a preference for peptides containing a lysine. Mass spectrometry analysis of the bound peptides showed that peptides between two and five amino acids long bind to the protein and indeed hinted at a preference for positively charged peptides. The preference of OppA for peptides with basic residues, in particular lysines, was corroborated by binding studies with peptides of defined sequence using isothermal titration calorimetry and intrinsic protein fluorescence titration. The protein bound tripeptides and tetrapeptides containing positively charged residues with high affinity, whereas related peptides without lysines/arginines were bound with low affinity. A structure of OppA in an open conformation in the absence of ligands was also determined to 2.0 Å, revealing that the initial binding site displays a negative surface charge, consistent with the observed preference for positively charged peptides. Taken together, E. coli OppA appears to have a preference for basic peptides."
CD008892,0,9579614,1,Diagnosis of enteric fever caused by Salmonella spp. in Vietnam by a monoclonal antibody-based dot-blot ELISA.,"Enteric fever caused by Salmonella spp. is prevalent in Vietnam. None of the currently available diagnostic methods meets the ideal criteria on rapidity, simplicity, sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness and practicality for developing areas. In this study, a recently developed monoclonal antibody-based dot-blot ELISA was used in comparison with the hemoculture method and the classical Widal test for diagnosis of salmonellosis in 171 Vietnamese patients presenting with clinical features of enteric fever. Urine samples of 50 healthy counterparts were used as negative controls. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 77 of 171 patients (45%) while 98 and 111 patients were positive by dot-blot ELISA and Widal test, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the ELISA performed on three serial urine samples collected at 2 hour intervals of the 171 patients were 92.2%, 71.3%, 80.7%, 72.4% and 91.8%, respectively when compared with the culture method. The Widal test performed on acute and convalescence serum samples showed 87.0%, 46.8%, 68.4%, 60.4% and 83.3% diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values, respectively when compared with the bacterial culture method. Kappa coefficience revealed very good agreement beyond chance between the MAb-based ELISA and the culture method. The ELISA was not reactive when tested on urine samples of 50 healthy individuals which indicates 100% specificity. The Salmonella antigenuria of the patients as detected by ELISA lasted 10.3+/-3.9 days after initiating antibiotic treatment. The MAb-based dot-blot ELISA is easy to perform. It is rapid, sensitive, specific, inexpensive, and non-invasive and does not require equipment, thus is suitable for developing areas. It can detect acute/recent infection and can be used for evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment."

Blood culture is a standard test for diagnosis of typhoid fever, but well-equipped diagnostic facilities to perform culture are seldom available in endemic areas. We retrospectively compared 2 diagnostic field tests, a latex agglutination Dri-Dot assay and an IgM Lateral Flow assay, to blood culture, in patients with clinically diagnosed typhoid fever. Sensitivity of the Dri-Dot was 71.4%, and specificity was 86.3% for samples collected at time of first diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity of IgM Lateral Flow were 80% and 71.4%, respectively. A major limitation of these serologic tests is the limited sensitivity at the early stage of the disease. Performing both tests in parallel increased sensitivity to 84.3%, but decreased specificity to 70.5%. There was a trend towards improved diagnostic performance using either assay over a longer duration of illness. These rapid, point-of-care assays for typhoid fever provide easy-to-interpret results in typhoid-endemic countries and may be most useful in patients presenting 1 week after symptom onset."

They can be metabolised to reactive intermediates via N-hydroxylation catalysed by cytochrome P450 1A2, followed by conjugation of the resulting N-hydroxyl group by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) or sulfotransferase (SULT). In order to compare the role of O-acetylation and O-sulfonation by human enzymes in the activation of HAs, we have introduced the cDNAs for wild-type forms of human NAT1, NAT2 and SULT1A1 in the acetyltransferase-deficient Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1538/1,8-DNP. Functional expression of recombinant proteins was demonstrated using immunoblot analysis and determination of enzyme activity with characteristic substrates. The established strains were used to study the mutagenicity of the N-hydroxy derivatives of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). The results demonstrate that N-hydroxy-HAs are activated by different human enzymes. At the concentrations used in the mutagenicity assay, N-hydroxy-IQ was activated by human NAT2, but not by NAT1 or SULT1A1. In contrast, N-hydroxy-PhIP was activated specifically by human SULT1A1, but not by NAT1 or NAT2. Therefore, both O-acetylation and O-sulfonation by human enzymes have to be regarded as important determinants for HA genotoxicity in humans."

There was no significant statistical differences of frequency of appearance of antibodies to all three Salmonella antigens in sera from patients with salmonelosis and in sera from control group. This study showed that all three antigens are useful for determination of IgA, IgG, IgM antibodies for Salmonella serogroup B and D in routine serological diagnosis of salmonelosis. However, it should be considered possibility of cross-reaction between LPS antigen of Salmonella and antibodies to Yersinia enterocolitica which could be correlated with similarity between somatic antigens of these two pathogens."

This cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence of typhoid fever in 200 consecutive patients with fever and symptoms clinically compatible with typhoid fever to verify recent estimates of a high prevalence of typhoid fever in Cameroon. Patients were enrolled in three of the 10 provinces of Cameroon. Blood culture, thick and thin blood smears and Widal tests using acute sera were performed in all cases; stool culture for 120 patients.

From Jan to June 1990, this resistance has increased to 81%. 74 strains of blood culture isolated of S typhi obtained from Jan to June were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity testing by disc diffusion technique of Kirby and Bauer 60 strains were found to show a block resistance tochloramphenicol, Ampicillin, Co-trimoxazole, Streptomycin, Tetracycline and Carbenicillin. All strains were sensitive to quinolones. Resistance was record and MIC done in 50 resistant strains by modified National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [NCCLS] according to recommended break points and resistance to Chloramphenicol was confirmed. Of the 47 strains isolated, 34 had received treatment with either chlorampheniicol, Ampicillin or Cotrimoxazole in adequate dosages. In 39 of these 47 patients, Salmonella typhi was isolated after 14 days duration of fever. Plasmid analysis revealed presence of 100 megadalton plasmid in majority of cases. Most patients responded to fluoroquinolones but amongst the admitted patients complications such as Myoglobinuria in 2 cases, perforation in 4 cases, acute Renal failure in 2 cases and typhoid spine in 1 case were seen.

Twenty-one of them (84%) showed resistance to chloramphenicol and 24 (96%) to cotrimoxazole. All the 25 cases were sensitive to norfloxacin, gentamicin and cephalexin. Sixteen of 21 chloramphenicol resistant typhoid cases in whom chloramphenicol was initially started failed to respond to this drug even after 5 to 7 days, thereby indicating that in vivo response matched with the in vitro sensitivity. Clinical response to norfloxacin, whether given initially or following chloramphenicol failure, was prompt and satisfactory. Norfloxacin thus appears to be a good choice in such cases."
CD008892,0,15609783,0,Costs of illness due to typhoid fever in an Indian urban slum community: implications for vaccination policy.,"Data on the burden of disease, costs of illness, and cost-effectiveness of vaccines are needed to facilitate the use of available anti-typhoid vaccines in developing countries. This one-year prospective surveillance was carried out in an urban slum community in Delhi, India, to estimate the costs of illness for cases of typhoid fever. Ninety-eight culture-positive typhoid, 31 culture-positive paratyphoid, and 94 culture-negative cases with clinical typhoid syndrome were identified during the surveillance. Estimates of costs of illness were based on data collected through weekly interviews conducted at home for three months following diagnosis. Private costs included the sum of direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs. Non-patient (public) costs included costs of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, laboratory tests, and medicines provided free of charge to the families. The mean cost per episode of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever was 3,597 Indian Rupees (US$ 1=INR 35.5) (SD 5,833); hospitalization increased the costs by several folds (INR 18,131, SD 11,218, p<0.0001). The private and non-patient costs of illness were similar (INR 1,732, SD 1,589, and INR 1,865, SD 5,154 respectively, p=0.8095). The total private and non-patient ex-ante costs, i.e. expected annual losses for each individual, were higher for children aged 2-5 years (INR 154) than for those aged 5-19 years (INR 32), 0-2 year(s) (INR 25), and 19-40 years (INR 2). The study highlights the need for affordable typhoid vaccines efficacious at 2-5 years of age. Currently-available Vi vaccine is affordable but is unlikely to be efficacious in the first two years of life. Ways must be found to make Vi-conjugate vaccine, which is efficacious at this age, available to children of developing-countries."
CD008892,0,15609784,0,A cost-benefit analysis of typhoid fever immunization programmes in an Indian urban slum community.,"Many economic analyses of immunization programmes focus on the benefits in terms of public-sector cost savings, but do not incorporate estimates of the private cost savings that individuals receive from vaccination. This paper considers the implications of Bahl et al.'s cost-of-illness estimates for typhoid immunization policy by examining how community-level incidence estimates and information on distribution of costs of illness among patients and the public-health sector can be used in the economic analysis of vaccination-programme options. The findings illustrate why typhoid vaccination programmes may often appear to be unattractive to public-health officials who adopt a public budgetary perspective. Under many plausible sets of assumptions, public-sector expenditure on typhoid vaccination does not yield comparable public-sector cost savings. If public-health officials adopt a societal perspective on the economic benefits of vaccination, there are many situations in which different vaccination programmes will make economic sense. The findings show that this is especially true when public decision-makers recognize that (a) the incidence of typhoid fever is underestimated by blood culture-positive cases and (b) avoided costs of illness represent a significant underestimate of the actual economic benefits to individuals of vaccination."

The Vi antigen was extracted from serovar Typhi cells, under the optimised growth conditions for its over-expression. Anti-Vi antibodies were produced and conjugated with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of definite size (~30 nm), which served as the nano-bioprobe in the detection system. A sandwich immunoassay was developed using nitrocellulose dot blot comb (8/12 wells) membranes immobilized with anti-Salmonella antibodies at the optimal concentration (43 ng spot(-1)). The Vi antigen in the clinical isolates, spiked samples and also in the standard strain (serovar Typhi Ty2) was detected by measuring the colour intensity of GNPs and correlating it with the concentration of serovar Typhi in samples. Using this developed immunoassay technique Vi positive serovar Typhi strains could be detected with a sensitivity of up to 10(2) cells mL(-1) in the clinical isolates as well as in the spiked samples. The developed immunoassay technique could be useful for the detection of typhoid fever and may be important from an epidemiological point of view."

CD008892,0,9356251,0,"Distinct regions of bacterial flagellar switch protein FliM interact with FliG, FliN and CheY.","The FliG, FliM, and FliN proteins of the bacterial flagellar motor are believed to interact with one another to form the switch complex, which in turn is thought to interact with one of the chemotaxis proteins, CheY. In particular, FliM appears to be an intermediary between CheY and FliG: the current model suggests that CheY, when phosphorylated (CheY-P), binds to FliM and produces a conformational change in FliM that is propagated to FliG. The result of these interactions is to induce clockwise rotation of the flagellar motors and tumbling of the cell. Various genetic and biochemical studies have provided evidence that the switch proteins associate with each other and that CheY-P binds to FliM. Here, we have used affinity blotting to obtain direct evidence of interaction between Salmonella typhimurium FliM and FliN, FliM and FliG, and FliM and CheY-P. We have also examined the ability of various FliM deletion and truncation mutant proteins to bind to FliN, FliG, and CheY-P. From these data, we conclude that distinct regions of the FliM protein bind to each of these other proteins. We propose a model in which the N-terminal region of FliM binds to CheY-P, the middle region of FliM binds to FliG, and the C-terminal region binds to FliN."

The study was carried out in the department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh between July, 2010 and June, 2011, including 200 individuals of different age and sex. Of them, 150 were clinically suspected cases of typhoid fever and 50 age-sex matched controls. Among 150 blood samples from the suspected cases 106(70.7%) were positive for IgM of Salmonella typhi by ICT and 67(44.7%) were positive by Widal test. Whereas, among the 50 controls 4(8%) were positive by ICT and 6(12%) were positive by Widal test. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the ICT was found as 83.3%, 92.00%, 91.9% and 83.6% respectively. On the other hand corresponding values for Widal test were of 44.4%, 88%, 80% and 59.5% respectively.

PC membrane was surface modified with glycine and activated by EDC/NHS for immobilization of S. typhi specific IgG. Antibody immobilized porous PC membrane was incubated with bacteria contaminated water for immunocapturing of S. typhi. Antibody conjugated QDs were also prepared by using carbodiimide chemistry. Both modified PC membrane and quantum dots were characterized by using various modern analytical tools. It was estimated that 1.95 molecules of QDs were successfully bio-conjugated per unit of IgG. PC membrane with captured bacteria was incubated with prepared IgG conjugated QDs for the formation of sandwich complex. Analysis of the regions of interest (ROI) in fluorescent micrographs showed that newly developed method based on PC and fluorescent QDs has 100 times higher detection sensitivity (100 cells/mL) as compared with detection using conventional dye (FITC) based methods.

The aim of the study was to determine the in vivo effect of bovine LF in Salmonella ser. Typhimurium infection in mice. 58 BALB/c mice were employed. Two hours before the infection with 300 microl of 10(7) CFU of Salmonella ser. Typhimurium, 29 mice received LF (2 mg) and 29 placebo (buffer). After the infection, the mice received LF (10 mg/ml) ad libitum or buffer, respectively, for 7 days. Mortality, weight and clinical signs (piloerection, hunched position and reduced movement) were monitored daily. The degree of inflammation and necrosis in the intestine, liver, spleen and brain were studied with a blinded observer. The mortality in the control group (8/29) was higher than in the LF group (1/29) (Kapplan Meier P < 0.05). From the third day post-infection the control group were significantly more symptomatic (P < 0.05). The blood culture for Salmonella spp. was positive for all mice studied in the control group (17/17), but positive in the LF group in only 6/17 animals (P < 0.05).

Clinical manifestations of fifteen patients who presented with the acute onset of right lower quadrant pain and sonographically enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and normal appendix were evaluated. For etiologic diagnosis, stool culture, serologic test for Epstein-Barr virus, and Widal test were performed. Colonoscopy with mucosal biopsies and microbial tissue cultures were performed in 12 of 15 patients. Of fifteen patients 6 were male and the average age was 29.9 (17 approximately 41) years. Associated symptoms were diarrhea (80%), fever (73%), nausea and vomiting (27%). Right lower quadrant tenderness was observed in all cases but rebound tenderness was observed only in 26.7% of the cases. Etiology was identified in 7 cases (47%): 2 Yersinia enterocolitica infection, 2 non-typhoidal Salmonella infection, 2 tuberculosis, and 1 typhoid fever. In colonoscopic examination, signs of active inflammation were observed in 9 cases (75%) and inactive or normal findings in 3 cases (25%). All of our patients, except for the patients with tuberculosis and typhoid fever who needed specific antibiotic therapy, improved spontaneously without using antibiotics. In conclusion, the etiology of mesenteric adenitis in Korean adults seems to be different from that of western countries. Furthermore, mesenteric adenitis in Korean adults is a clinical syndrome, frequently found in a relatively young age group, which improves spontaneously unless specific anti-microbial agents are indicated by microbiological tests, such as tuberculosis or typhoid fever."

A 4-fold difference in the titres was noticed in 50 sera of the test group and no change in the titres of the control group. The early rising 'O' antibodies which are of IgM in nature and formed due to recent infection are inactivated by 2-mercaptoethanol while it has no effect on IgG antibodies which are formed due to flagellar 'H' antigens or due to anamnestic response or by nonspecific reasons. The use of modified Widal test along with conventional one can therefore help in the diagnosis of enteric fever with certainty.

Control whole milk, UF control milk, inoculated whole milk, and inoculated UF milk were made into Monterey Jack cheese using traditional procedures. The process of cheese manufacture was followed by determination of pH, titratable acidity, and microbial population levels. The cheeses were stored for 6 mo and analyzed every month for percentage solids and microbial population levels. Generally, numbers of contaminant microbes increased at a similar rate during manufacture in all cheeses. During the 6-mo ripening period, bacterial starter culture population levels remained high, psychrotrophs declined slowly, Staphylococcus levels remained stable, and Salmonella populations decreased. No Staphylococcus enterotoxin was detected by reverse passive latex agglutination assay."

Similar results (93% and 54% positive sera respectively) were obtained for specific IgM as assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using lipopolysaccharide of S. typhi as antigen (median relative titer: 0.32 and 0.21 respectively). In contrast, specific IgG at significant concentrations were found in only 69% of the Austrian (median relative titer: 0.16) but 88% of the Hong Kong sera (median relative titer: 0.71). The (IgM-detecting) microagglutination test may be sufficiently diagnostic for typhoid fever in nonendemic areas such as Austria. In endemic regions like Hong Kong, however, tests indicative for early specific IgG are indispensable for serological diagnosis of the disease. The ELISA proved useful and is an example for such tests."
CD008892,0,12666454,0,[Diagnostic difficulties in febrile travellers returning from the tropics. Two cases of typhoid fever imported from India].,"Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease caused by Salmonella enterica serotype typhi. The infection is responsible for endemic or epidemic outbreaks in tropical and subtropical countries, especially in Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Central and South Africa. Latin America, and it occurs sporadically in Poland. We reported two cases of imported typhoid fever after travelling to India and Nepal. In the tourists returning from the area hyperendemic for malaria, visceral leishmaniosis, amoebiasis and haemorrhagic fevers and not following tropical hygiene measures, persistent fever was a source of difficulties in differential diagnosis. In the first case, lack of anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis in the presence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia strongly suggested Plasmodium spp. infection. Two daily peaks of fever with splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, leucopenia, high transaminases levels and co-existing positive serology for L. donovani pointed to visceral leishmaniosis. Late occurrence of specific anti-S. typhi agglutinins in the Widal test, cross-reactivity with S. paratyphi A and negative urine bacteriological culture were observed. In the second case, gastrointestinal disturbances, including pain, abdominal tenderness and diarrhoea gave a suspicion of amoebic colitis. Stool and urine cultures were negative for S. typhi and cross reactions with S. paratyphi A and C were reported. Typhoid fever was finally confirmed in both patients by an isolation of S. typhi from peripheral blood cultures. The effectiveness of treatment of choice with ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone in a case of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain of S. typhi was documented."

CD008892,0,8222322,0,Diagnosis of typhoid fever: detection of Salmonella typhi porins-specific antibodies by inhibition ELISA.,"Porins are highly immunogenic outer membrane proteins of Salmonella. Sera from typhoid patients contained a high level of IgG antibodies directed to porins of Salm. typhi. Since porins are highly conserved proteins, anti-porins antibodies both from typhoid patients and healthy normals reacted with porins from several Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, in order to improve the specificity of detecting Salm. typhi porins-specific antibodies, an inhibition ELISA was developed using enzyme-conjugated MoAbs (MP1 and MPN4) specific to Salm. typhi porins. Sera from typhoid patients with positive haemoculture (16 out of 17) inhibited the binding of MP1 to porins, thus showing a positive test for typhoid, whereas sera from patients with other Gram-negative bacterial infections (n = 7) and from healthy volunteers (66 out of 67) were found to be negative. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of this assay were 94.1, 98.7, 97.8, 94.1 and 98.7% respectively. The validity of our inhibition ELISA for typhoid was higher than that of the Widal test. The diagnosis of typhoid fever as early as 3 days after the onset of fever, using a single specimen is possible."

Use of ciprofloxacin in children, although discouraged, is increasing and we aimed to assess whether its use affects growth or the prevalence of joint symptomology. Children under 6 years of age diagnosed as typhoid fever on the basis of a positive Widal test were recruited in the outpatient department of a paediatric teaching hospital after treatment had been initiated. During 6 months follow-up, prevalences of arthritis/arthralgia and ponderal, linear and knemometric growth were recorded. Seventy-five children were recruited (mean age 32 months, mean weight-for-height Z-score--1.3, mean height-for-age Z-score 1.4) and 29 (39%) of them received ciprofloxacin. No significant adverse effects on ponderal, linear or knemometric growth, or on the incidence of arthritis/arthralgia were found to be associated with the use of ciprofloxacin. Knemometric and ponderal catch-up growth was demonstrable 30 days after diagnosis but linear growth was still declining 3 months after diagnosis with catch-up growth demonstrable only after 6 months. We conclude that ciprofloxacin is commonly used in typhoid fever and has no adverse effects on growth or joint symptomology."

CD008892,0,25461402,0,Methylsulfonylmethane inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation.,"Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is an organosulfur compound and the health benefits associated with MSM include inflammation. Although MSM has been shown to have various physiological effects, no study has yet focused on inflammasome activation. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that serves as a platform for caspase 1-dependent proteolytic maturation and secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). In this study, we tested the effect of MSM on inflammasome activation using mouse and human macrophages. In our results, MSM significantly attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages, although it had no effect on NLCR4 or AIM2 inflammasome activation. Extracts of MSM-enriched vegetables presented the same inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation as MSM. MSM also attenuated the transcriptional expression of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and NLRP3. Taken together, these results show that MSM has anti-inflammatory characteristics, interrupts NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and inhibits pro-cytokine expression. We further confirmed the intracellular mechanism of MSM in relation to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, followed by comparison with that of DMSO. Both chemicals showed a synergic effect on anti-NLRP3 activation and attenuated production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, MSM is a selective inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and can be developed as a supplement to control several metabolic disorders."

In 36 of 154 patients DSCC could not be used, usually because the patient was too ill to swallow the capsule. In the remaining 118 patients DSCC was positive in 57.6%, RSC in 35.6%, BC in 54.2%, and BMAC in 85.6%. The sensitivity of DSCC was improved by an additional 4.7% if subcultured daily for seven days. The DSCC has no advantage over the combination of RSC and BC and is inferior in sensitivity to the BMAC.

CD008892,0,14604543,0,The TUBEX typhoid test based on particle-inhibition immunoassay detects IgM but not IgG anti-O9 antibodies.,"A serological test kit (TUBEX, IDL Biotech, Sweden) developed recently for the diagnosis of typhoid fever detects antibodies to the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O9 antigen. The antibodies are detected by their ability to inhibit the interaction between two types of reagent particles: (a). indicator latex microspheres sensitized with an anti-O9 monoclonal antibody, and (b). magnetic microspheres sensitized with S. typhi LPS. Following rapid mixing of the serum with these reagents and sedimentation of the magnetic particles by magnetic force, the concentration of indicator particles left in suspension provides a measure of the inhibition. Whereas it was previously assumed that both IgM and IgG antibodies could inhibit in the system, the present study reveals, surprisingly, that only the IgM antibodies do. It is not clear why IgG anti-O9 antibodies, both of mouse and human origin, do not inhibit, although these can bind to the LPS-sensitized magnetic particles as efficiently as the IgM antibodies. In addition, they can also inhibit very well in another detection system (ELISA) which uses a similar assay format and the same antibody and antigen reagents. Increasing the size of the LPS-sensitized microspheres made no difference; microscopic analysis of the TUBEX reaction mixture revealed that while the indicator particles bound abundantly to the IgG-aggregated LPS-sensitized particles, forming large clumps, these only formed a very light decoration on the IgM-aggregated particles. Thus, the TUBEX system is ideally suited for use in the diagnosis of infections as it allows IgM antibodies to be detected easily and rapidly from whole sera."

CD008892,0,13306859,0,An experimental analysis of the curative action of penicillin in acute bacterial infections. III. The effect of suppuration upon the antibacterial action of the drug.,"The results of the experimental analysis reported in this and the two preceding papers (10, 11) indicate that in murine pneumococcal infections penicillin per se destroys the invading organisms only in those parts of the lesions where the bacteria are multiplying rapidly and are thus maximally susceptible to the bactericidal action of the drug. In areas where the bacterial growth rate is slowed, either because the pneumococci have reached a maximum population density, or because the accumulated exudate affords a relatively poor medium for rapid growth, the destructive effect of the antibiotic is greatly diminished. In such portions of the lessions the cellular defenses of the host are observed to play a major role in eliminating the bacteria. In sites where frank suppuration has developed, however, even the combined actions of the penicillin and the cellular defenses of the host are relatively ineffective in ridding the tissues of bacteria. Here, because of the poor medium provided by the pus, the pneumococci remain metabolically sluggish and therefore are not killed rapidly by the penicillin. At the same time the leucocytes in the necrotic exudate have deteriorated to the point where they cannot effectively perform their phagocytic functions. As a result, bacteria persist in such lesions for many days in spite of the most intensive penicillin treatment administered both locally and systemically. A strict analogy cannot be drawn between the action of penicillin upon specific pneumococcal lesions produced in the laboratory and its effect upon acute bacterial infections in man. Host-parasite relationships in acute bacterial infections are determined not only by the strain of parasite and the specific host involved, but also by the site in the body at which the infection occurs (16). Nevertheless, in spite of the number of variables involved, it may be possible, by means of selected laboratory models, to illustrate general principles of infection which in all probability apply to human disease. Bearing in mind the limitations of the methods employed in the present experiments, it would appear justifiable to draw the following conclusions concerning the clinical use of penicillin in acute infections caused by penicillin-sensitive bacteria. The earlier that treatment is begun the more likely is penicillin to effectuate a rapid cure. When therapy is started before the bacteria have reached a maximum population density in any part of the lesion, and before a cellular exudate is formed, the great majority of the infecting organisms will be in a state of active multiplication and thus will be killed promptiy by the bactericidal action of the drug. If, on the other hand, treatment is delayed until the bacterial growth has attained its maximum in older parts of the lesion, and the inflammatory reaction has become well advanced, the resultant slowing of bacterial metabolism will so interfere with the bactericidal action of the penicillin that ultimate destruction of many of the bacteria will have to depend upon the slower clearing effect of the phagocytic cells. In such instances of delayed therapy specific antibody, which is formed relatively slowly, may play an important role in recovery (6). If relapse is to be avoided, however, penicillin therapy must often be continued longer in well established infections than in those treated at a very early stage. Still further delay in treating infections which are prone to cause tissue destruction and suppuration, may lead to the establishment of abscesses. Fully developed abscesses often will not respond to chemotherapy alone; they will ultimately require drainage. As shown by the present murine experiments, the relative ineffectiveness of penicillin under these circumstances is due not only to the failure of the drug to kill the metabolically sluggish bacteria surviving in the pus, but also to the ineffectiveness of the phagocytic cells, most of which are non-motile or dead. Even if specific antibody gains access to such purulent foci, many of the bacteria will continue to survive because of the degenerated state of the leucocytes. It is evident, therefore, that the stage of the infection at which penicillin treatment is begun is often crucial. Equally critical may be the location of the infection. Bacterial lesions in different sites of the body vary greatly in their responses to penicillin therapy. This inconstancy of therapeutic effectiveness is due primarily to the participation of host factors of defense which differ widely in various tissues and at the same time play a major role in the curative action of the antibiotic. In cases of pneumococcal pneumonia, for example, in which each milliliter of the patient's blood contains more than 1000 pneumococci, blood cultures may become negative in a matter of minutes after the start of intensive treatment (17). The remarkable promptness with which penicillin therapy controls such acute bacteriemia is due, first, to its suppressive effect upon the primary infection in the lungs and regional lymph nodes from which the bacteria are being poured into the blood stream (16) and, secondly, to its synergistic action with the cellular defenses of the circulation. The latter are known to be extraordinarily efficient, perhaps more so than in any other tissue of the body (18). Assisting them in destroying the circulating bacteria is the penicillin's own bactericidal effect, which operates rapidly upon the metabolically active organisms in the plasma. Rarely, if ever, as they often do in other tissues of the body (10), do bacteria in the bloodstream reach such numbers, or do inflammatory cells accumulate intravascularly to such an extent, as to create metabolic conditions which depress the bactericidal actions of the antibiotic. In contrast, more prolonged and extensive penicillin therapy is needed to cure pneumococcal endocarditis (19), meningitis (19, 20), or infections of the serous cavities (3, 4). The cellular defenses of the heart valves and of the ""open"" fluid-containing cavities of the body are relatively inefficient as compared to those that operate in the bloodstream and in tissues with tightiy knit architectures such as the lungs and lymph nodes (16). In endocarditis relatively few phagocytic cells ever reach the site of the offending bacteria (21), and in infections of fluid-containing cavities, the phagocytic efficiency of the mobilized leucocytes is seriously interfered with by the ""dilution effect"" of the fluid (22, 23). Accordingly, final destruction of the bacteria must depend primarily upon the bactericidal effect of the antibiotic itself, since little assistance is provided by phagocytosis. It is no wonder, therefore, that such infections, as compared to bacteriemia, are relatively refractory to penicillin therapy. Certainly penicillin, in spite of its remarkable therapeutic properties, falls far short of being a therapia sterilans magna (24). Its effectiveness does not depend solely upon the inherent susceptibility of the infecting agent to its antimicrobial action. How readily it will cure a given infection is determined also by the state of growth of the bacteria in the various zones of the lesions, the influence of the purulent exudate upon the bactericidal action of the drug, and the destructive effect of the inflammatory phagocytes upon the invading bacteria. Optimal use of penicillin as a therapeutic agent requires due consideration of all of these factors. Finally, it should be emphasized that the conclusions drawn from this experimental analysis cannot be applied to antibiotic therapy in general. They pertain only to the action of penicillin in acute infections caused by penicillin-sensitive bacteria which act in the host as extracellular parasites (16). The most common human infections included in this category are those caused by pneumococci and Group A beta hemolytic streptococci.(7) Whether they apply also to infections due to penicillin-sensitive staphylococci may be questioned because of recent evidence that certain pathogenic strains will survive phagocytosis (27). In diseases such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, and typhoid fever, which are treated with antibiotics having properties different from those of penicillin (28) and which are caused by bacteria capable of intracellular parasitism (28), factors other than those considered in the present analysis must certainly be involved in the curative effect of antimicrobial therapy."

Here, the effectiveness of a flagellin fusion protein of Salmonella containing a 19-amino-acid sequence derived from the ST sequence (FLA--ST) in generating antibodies capable of neutralizing the toxic activity of ST was evaluated. This fusion protein, and an alternative construction where two cysteine residues in the ST sequence were substituted by alanines (ST(mt)), were delivered to the immune system by three distinct strategies: (i) orally, using an attenuated Salmonella strain expressing FLA--ST; (ii) intraperitoneally, by injection of purified FLA--ST; (iii) orally, using attenuated Salmonella carrying a eukaryotic expression plasmid (pCDNA3) with the gene encoding FLA-ST. The results showed that the flagellin system can be used as a carrier to generate ST-neutralizing antibodies. However, it should be mentioned that humoral immune response against ST was only obtained when the mutated ST sequence was employed. FLA-ST was found to be non-immunogenic when delivered via the oral route with attenuated Salmonella strains. However, a flagellin antibody response was obtained by immunizing mice with Salmonella carrying pCDNA3/FLA-ST(mt). Oral immunization with Salmonella carrying the eukaryotic expression plasmid (pCDNA3/FLA--ST(mt)) seems to be a promising method to elicit an appropriate response against fusions to flagellin."

This article describes a case of an otherwise healthy, active duty male military member with an insidious onset of right knee pain during a deployment to Kuwait. His work-up revealed an infectious process in the distal femur. Operative treatment and intravenous antibiotics resolved the infection. Intraoperative cultures revealed the rare isolate Salmonella enterica serotype C2 (Newport). Postoperative medical management revealed new-onset diabetes mellitus, possibly making this otherwise healthy host susceptible to this rare infection. Salmonella are gram-negative bacteria. Infection with nontyphoidal Salmonella species most commonly manifests as intestinal illness. Although it may be difficult for clinicians to accurately predict this rare entity as the causative organism in osteomyelitis, they may be aided by a history of travel to endemic regions or exposure to animal carriers. Comorbidities that seem to increase susceptibility include diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus, hemoglobinopathies, and immunosuppression. Blood cultures are reported to be frequently positive in cases of Salmonella osteomyelitis. Identification of Salmonella species from intraoperative cultures should prompt consultation with the infectious disease department for culture-specific antibiotic tailoring.

The two groups were comparable in their clinical and baseline characteristics. The clinical efficacy was similar in the two groups with only 2 (one in each group) clinical failures and all showing bacteriological eradication on subsequent blood culture. The time of defervescence was comparable in both groups (4.87 Fluconazole Prophylaxis against Fungal Colonization and Invasive Fungal Infection in Very Low Birth Weight Infants 2.33 vs 4.27 +/- 2.28 days, P = 0.308), with no relapse during 3 months follow up and no significant adverse effect. CP reduced the treatment cost by 33% in comparison to cefixime. Our study suggests CP is effective, safe and cheaper oral option for treatment of typhoid fever in children."
CD008892,0,9434847,0,"Genotoxicity assessment of suspended particulate matter in the Elbe river: comparison of Salmonella microsome test, arabinose resistance test, and umu-test.","This study evaluates the applicability of three bacterial short-term genotoxicity test systems to aquatic suspended particulate matter of the Elbe river. This material was sampled in sedimentation vessels after deposition periods of one month. It was extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with toluene and methanol. Aqueous elutriates were prepared additionally. A solid phase method was developed that enables to incubate bacteria in contact with the particulate material. The test battery consists of two mutagenicity assays (the Ames-test and the Ara-test) and an SOS induction assay (the umu-test). Both mutagenicity assays came to nearly the same assessment of the samples of particulate matter of the Elbe. The quantitative response, however, was higher in the Ara-test. The particulate river material generally induced lower genotoxic potencies in the umu-test than in the mutagenicity assays. This lead to a completely different outcome of the umu-test; 29 out of 35 mutagenic samples were not SOS inducing. No quantitative or rank correlations between the concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants (PAHs, chlorinated hydrocarbons and metals) and the observed effects could be established on a 90% confidence limit. However, there is obvious correspondence between more contaminated regions of the river system and mutagenic effects (Ames- and Ara-test) in the samples from this region, as well as correspondence between low contaminated regions and the absence of mutagenicity. For this reason, the mutagenicity assays appear more favourable to describe the anthropogenic contamination with genotoxins in complex mixtures than the umu-test. The authors recommend the Ara-test for a first genotoxicity screening of complex environmental mixtures. This forward mutagenicity assay is advantageous due to higher effects and lower costs compared to the Ames-test. The development and use of a solid phase version of Ames- and Ara-test revealed the occurrence of a major part of particle-bound mutagens. The hydrophobic nature of these mutagens was also confirmed by the gradually decreasing effects with decreasing lipophilicity of the solvents. The results suggest that the solid phase test and the use of extracts complement each other in detecting mutagens of different lipophilicity. Both versions should be used in order to include a broad variety of compounds."
CD008892,0,23624387,0,Determination of the physiological 2:2 TLR5:flagellin activation stoichiometry revealed by the activity of a fusion receptor.,"Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) recognizes flagellin of most flagellated bacteria, enabling activation of the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. The recently published crystal structure of a truncated zebrafish TLR5 ectodomain in complex with an inactive flagellin fragment indicated binding of two flagellin molecules to a TLR5 homodimer, however this complex did not dimerize in solution. In the present study, we aimed to determine the physiological stoichiometry of TLR5:flagellin activation by the use of a chimeric protein composed of an active flagellin fragment linked to the N-terminus of human TLR5 (SF-TLR5). This construct was constitutively active. Inactivation by the R90D mutation within flagellin demonstrated that autoactivation of the chimeric protein depended solely on the specific interaction between TLR5 and flagellin. Addition of wild-type hTLR5 substantially lowered autoactivation of SF-TLR5 in a concentration dependent manner, an effect which was reversible by the addition of exogenous Salmonella typhimurium flagellin, indicating the biological activity of a TLR5:flagellin complex with a 2:2 stoichiometry. These results, in addition to the combinations of inactive P736H mutation within the BB-loop of the TIR domain of TLR5 and SF-TLR5, further confirm the mechanism of TLR5 activation."
CD008892,0,15948960,0,Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium MisL is an intestinal colonization factor that binds fibronectin.,"MisL is an autotransporter protein encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 3 (SPI3). To investigate the role of MisL in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) pathogenesis, we characterized its function during infection of mice and identified a host receptor for this adhesin. In a mouse model of S. Typhimurium intestinal persistence, a misL mutant was shed with the faeces in significantly lower numbers than the wild type and was impaired in its ability to colonize the cecum. Previous studies have implicated binding of extracellular matrix proteins as a possible mechanism for S. Typhimurium intestinal persistence. A gluthathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein to the MisL passenger domain (GST-MisL(29-281)) was constructed to investigate binding to extracellular matrix proteins. In a solid-phase binding assay the purified GST-MisL(29-281) fusion protein bound to fibronectin and collagen IV, but not to collagen I. MisL expression was not detected by Western blot in S. Typhimurium grown under standard laboratory conditions. However, when expression of the cloned misL gene was driven by the Escherichia coli arabinose promoter, MisL could be detected in the S. Typhimurium outer membrane by Western blot and on the bacterial cell surface by flow cytometry. Expression of MisL enabled S. Typhimurium to bind fibronectin to its cell surface, resulting in attachment to fibronectin-coated glass slides and in increased invasiveness for human epithelial cells derived from colonic carcinoma (T84 cells). These data identify MisL as an extracellular matrix adhesin involved in intestinal colonization."
CD008892,0,8485561,0,Salmonella infection in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are susceptible to infections, notably salmonellosis. We report 37 cases of salmonella infection in 24 patients with SLE. These cases were detected in a group of 770 patients with SLE. All the patients were women, with a mean age of 25.6 years. At the onset of salmonella infection, 81% were taking prednisolone and 27% were taking cytotoxic drugs. Renal involvement was present in 75% of patients, which was approximately the same as in other SLE patients. Bacteremia, arthritis, osteomyelitis and rare manifestations of salmonellosis, including pulmonary and urinary tract involvement, were encountered. Diagnosis was based on isolation of the microorganism, mostly from blood cultures. Salmonella species other than typhi and paratyphi were often responsible. Widal agglutination test was positive in less than half the cases, and leukopenia was not seen frequently. Recurrence of infection in 29% of the patients and the high mortality rate (28.5%), despite the conventional period of appropriate antimicrobial treatment, show a poor prognosis of salmonellosis in SLE patients. This special picture of salmonellosis argues for a much longer period of treatment in these patients."

Diagnosis was based on clinical illness and isolation of Salmonella typhi or S. paratyphi A/B from blood cultures or stool cultures. The dosage of pivamdinocillin in adults was 400 to 800 mg, every 6 hours, for 10 to 16 days; dosage in children was half this amount for 11 to 15 days. Of the 21 patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 18 (86 percent) showed a satisfactory clinical response; 13 of these 18 had negative stools immediately after therapy, and two more were negative at the time of discharge (total: 83 percent). Mean hospital stay of these patients was 34.5 days. Of the 26 patients treated with amdinocillin, 23 showed a satisfactory clinical response; 20 of those responding clinically were still excreting the causative organism at the end of therapy; seven of the group remained as convalescent patients who continued to excrete the causative organism in feces at the time of discharge. Mean hospital stay was 43 days. The results of initial trials of amdinocillin and ampicillin in combination suggest that such therapy may be preferable to use of amdinocillin alone, although the excretion of the causative organism during convalescence has not been adequately assessed."

CD008892,0,9216741,0,Effects of marinating on heterocyclic amine carcinogen formation in grilled chicken.,"This study compared heterocyclic aromatic amines in marinated and unmarinated chicken breast meat flame-broiled on a propane grill. Chicken was marinated prior to grilling and the levels of several heterocyclic amines formed during cooking were determined by solid-phase extraction and HPLC. Compared with unmarinated controls, a 92-99% decrease in 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) was observed in whole chicken breast marinated with a mixture of brown sugar, olive oil, cider vinegar, garlic, mustard, lemon juice and salt, then grilled for 10, 20, 30 or 40 min. Conversely, 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) increased over 10-fold with marinating, but only at the 30 and 40 min cooking times. Marinating reduced the total detectable heterocyclic amines from 56 to 1.7 ng/g, from 158 to 10 ng/g and from 330 to 44 ng/g for grilling times of 20, 30 and 40 min, respectively. The mutagenic activity of the sample extracts was also measured, using the Ames/Salmonella assay. Mutagenic activity was lower in marinated samples cooked for 10, 20 and 30 min, but higher in the marinated samples cooked for 40 min, compared with unmarinated controls. Although a change in free amino acids, which are heterocyclic amine precursors, might explain the decrease in PhIP and increase in MeIQx, no such change was detected. Marinating chicken in one ingredient at a time showed that sugar was involved in the increased MeIQx, but the reason for the decrease in PhIP was unclear. PhIP decreased in grilled chicken after marinating with several individual ingredients. This work shows that marinating is one method that can significantly reduce PhIP concentration in grilled chicken."

However, no fleas have been found to be naturally infected concurrently with both rickettsial species. To examine whether one rickettsial species can develop simultaneously with another species in the same flea host, cat fleas, naturally infected with R. felis, were allowed to feed on blood containing R. typhi (Ethiopian strain, 10(7) PFU/ml). Experimental controls consisted of uninfected cat fleas, fleas infected with only R. typhi; and fleas naturally infected with only R. felis. After 9 d at 28 degrees C, the fleas were examined by PCR amplification and subsequent restriction digest analysis and dot blot hybridization of PCR products. Results from these studies demonstrated that R. felis and R. typhi are capable of co-existing in the same flea host. Subsequent isolation of R. typhi from dually infected fleas by tissue culture indicated that R. typhi was viable and capable of being maintained in fleas naturally infected with R. felis. As more studies confirm the presence of R. felis and R. typhi in domestic pets and peridomestic vertebrates in urban areas, the ability of the individual cat fleas, which live on these animals, to support both rickettsial species could be an epidemiologically important consideration."

There were 145 children who were culture positive (TYP-CP) for Salmonella typhi, while 166 were culture negative but were diagnosed as having typhoid (TYP-CN). Analyses of the sensitivity and specificity of combinations of initial Widal titres in predicting a positive S. typhi culture in a febrile child (culture positive vs the rest) showed the best model to be an O- and/or H-titre of > or = 1 in 40 (sensitivity 89%; specificity 89%). While the negative predictive value of the model was high (99.2%) the positive predictive value remained below 50% even for very high titres of O and H (> 1 in 640), at which point the specificity was 98.5%, supporting the clinical view that a high proportion of the TYP-CN patients really were typhoid but were missed by culture. The TYP-CN patients showed a very similar clinical and age profile to TYP-CP patients. The length of history of fever did not affect the initial Widal titre in culture positive cases. The Widal test in children remains a sensitive and specific 'fever screen' for typhoid although it will not identify all cases. In children, lower cut-off points for O- and H-titres should be used than are generally recommended."

The SEF14 antigen and flagella were extracted from S enteritidis and transferred to nitrocellulose paper for use in Western and dot blot tests. Antisera to 19 salmonella serotypes including S enteritidis were raised in rabbits and their cross reactivity to the flagellar and SEF14 antigens was evaluated. Cross reactivity with the SEF14 antigen was found in one antiserum, raised against S blegdam, and to flagella in eight of 19 antisera raised against various salmonella serotypes, most of which shared the flagellar factors g or m with S enteritidis. The intensity of cross reaction to flagella was strongest in S derby and S blegdam antisera. Antisera raised in chickens against S typhimurium and S panama did not cross react in either test, and neither did pooled sera from eight-week-old salmonella-free, broiler breeder parent chickens. Field sera from two commercial flocks with no history of salmonella infection were negative when tested by the LPS ELISA. These sera were also negative when tested by the flagellar and SEF14 blots. S enteritidis infection in a commercial laying flock was detected initially when the sera were tested by the LPS ELISA and confirmed in individual and pooled sera by the SEF14 and flagellar tests. S enteritidis PT4 was isolated from this flock post mortem."
CD008892,0,25059037,0,Anti-bacterial activity of Achatina CRP and its mechanism of action.,"The physiological role of C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute-phase protein, is not well documented, despite many reports on biological effects of CRP in vitro and in model systems in vivo. It has been suggested that CRP protects mice against lethal toxicity of bacterial infections by implementing immunological responses. In Achatina fulica CRP is a constitutive multifunctional protein in haemolymph and considered responsible for their survival in the environment for millions of years. The efficacy of Achatina CRP (ACRP) was tested against both Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis infections in mice where endogenous CRP level is negligible even after inflammatory stimulus. Further, growth curves of the bacteria revealed that ACRP (50 microg/mL) is bacteriostatic against gram negative salmonellae and bactericidal against gram positive bacilli. ACRP induced energy crises in bacterial cells, inhibited key carbohydrate metabolic enzymes such as phosphofructokinase in glycolysis, isocitrate dehydrogenase in TCA cycle, isocitrate lyase in glyoxylate cycle and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in gluconeogenesis. ACRP disturbed the homeostasis of cellular redox potential as well as reduced glutathione status, which is accompanied by an enhanced rate of lipid peroxidation. Annexin V-Cy3/CFDA dual staining clearly showed ACRP induced apoptosis-like death in bacterial cell population. Moreover, immunoblot analyses also indicated apoptosis-like death in ACRP treated bacterial cells, where activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP) and caspase-3 was noteworthy. It is concluded that metabolic impairment by ACRP in bacterial cells is primarily due to generation of reactive oxygen species and ACRP induced anti-bacterial effect is mediated by metabolic impairment leading to apoptosis-like death in bacterial cells."

Laboratory diagnosis requires isolation and identification of the organism from the patient's blood or feces. Feces is the specimen most commonly submitted to laboratories. Detection of bacterial antigens is an important adjunct to laboratory diagnosis. We carried out an in-house diagnostic method by preparing test reagents comprising of latex beads coated with specific antisera to detect Vi, O9 and H-d antigens of S. typhi. Fecal specimens from one hundred patients with diarrhea and fever as well as from twenty healthy controls were incubated for enrichment in Selenite F broth for 6 hours or overnight. Latex agglutination tests to detect antigens of S. typhi were carried out on centrifuged broth supernatants. Parallel cultures on media selective for S. typhi were also set up. Nine of the supernatants were positive for two or more specific antigens and S. typhi grew in three of the corresponding cultures. None of the samples from 20 healthy controls were positive by either the diagnostic method or by culture. The result of the in-house diagnostic assay can be obtained overnight and may help in directing immediate antimicrobial therapy."

The evidence for this epidemic is reviewed in the light of appropriate diagnosis of typhoid fever. All the patients were diagnosed as typhoid fever, primarily based on Widal test results. Investigations in the hospital of 15 patients confirmed malaria in 70% who, though failing to respond to chloroquine, promptly responded to treatment with Fansidar (sulfadoxine + pyrimethamine). Fever in the remaining 30%, without evidence of malaria and who failed to respond to chloroquine, Fansidar and antibacterials including chloramphenicol, remitted spontaneously. The merits and limitations of the Widal test are discussed. It is concluded that diagnosis of typhoid fever by the Widal test alone is prone to error, and that any claims of a typhoid fever epidemic in Nigeria remain mere conjecture. Misuse of the Widal test and, subsequently, misuse of the antibiotic chloramphenicol, should be very strongly condemned."

Samples were analyzed for Salmonella, and presumptive colonies were subjected to latex agglutination. Of the isolates recovered, a subset of 91 was characterized by serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and antimicrobial susceptibility phenotyping. Salmonella was isolated from 100% (hide), 94.1% (feces), 91.2% (mesenteric), 76.5% (subiliac), 55.9% (mandibular), and 7.4% (mediastinal) of samples. From the 87 typeable isolates, eight Salmonella enterica serotypes, including Kentucky (32.2%), Anatum (29.9%), Reading (17.2%), Meleagridis (12.6%), Cerro (4.6%), Muenster (1.1%), Give (1.1%), and Mbandaka (1.1%), were identified. S. Meleagridis was more likely (P = 0.03) to be recovered from lymph nodes than from feces or hides, whereas S. Kentucky was more likely (P = 0.02) to be recovered from feces and hides than from lymph nodes. The majority (59.3%) of the Salmonella isolates were pansusceptible; however, multidrug resistance was observed in 13.2% of isolates. Typing by PFGE revealed that Salmonella strains generally clustered by serotype, but some serotypes (Anatum, Kentucky, Meleagridis, and Reading) were comprised of multiple PFGE subtypes. Indistinguishable PFGE subtypes and, therefore, serotypes were isolated from multiple sample types, and multiple PFGE subtypes were commonly observed within an animal. Given the overrepresentation of some serotypes within lymph nodes, we hypothesize that certain Salmonella strains may be better at entering the bovine host than other Salmonella strains or that some may be better adapted for survival within lymph nodes. Our data provide insight into the ecology of Salmonella within cohorts of cattle and offer direction for intervention opportunities."

It aimed to study the clinical profile, the relative magnitude of enteric fever in children, especially in those below the age of two years and to determine the current antibiotic sensitivity pattern of Salmonella typhi and S paratyphi. Enteric fever is a significant problem in the preschool years. Sixty-five per cent of cases were in the age group of 2 to 9 years, 27% in 0-5 years and 13% in age group 0-2 years. Ninety-two per cent of the cases were caused by S typhi. Paratyphoid fever is less common (8%), when occurs is caused by S paratyphi A.

In Libya clinicians are heavily dependent on the Widal test for diagnosis of enteric fever which has been used without determining the locally appropriate threshold titer, because the laboratories lack the skilled, experienced personnel and appropriate facilities to detect and serotype Salmonella isolates. To improve the diagnosis process, clinical management and reliability of public health measures, there is an urgent need for the effective training of laboratory technicians and to provide resources to culture Salmonella species according to published guidelines.

Each of the four systems contained 5 ml of blood or the clot derived from 5 ml of blood and sufficient broth to yield a 1:11 dilution of the specimen. Of 542 patients studied, Salmonella paratyphi-A was isolated from 61, S. typhi from 46, and Brucella melitensis from 30. The two clot cultures yielded the salmonellae equally well; both were superior to whole blood cultured in Trypticase soy broth (P less than 0.02) but not to whole blood cultured in bile (P greater than 0.05). Only two systems were successful for isolation of B. melitensis. Blood-Trypticase soy broth identified 28 (93%), and clot-streptokinase cultures identified 21 (70%) (P greater than 0.05). The data indicate that use of clots per se offers no advantage in sensitivity over procedures which use whole blood.

In this study, we have demonstrated that the epitope specific to the MAb is unique to phase 1-d. To map the epitope, plasmids encoding different regions of S. typhi flagellin gene were constructed. Analysis of protein produced from each recombinant plasmid indicated that the epitope specific to the MAb resided within amino acids 171-303 (region IV) of S. typhi flagellin protein. The recombinant region IV flagellin was used to develop an ELISA for the detection of IgM antibody to S. typhi in serum. In the hemoculture-positive typhoid group, the developed ELISA was positive in 77 of 92 cases. In patients with non-typhoidal Salmonella, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria or dengue virus, the ELISA was negative in all 78 cases. Two from 116 healthy control subjects had positive reactions with the assay. The calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the test were 83.7%, 99.0%, 97.5% and 92.8%, respectively. With such high validity together with the requirement of only a single serum specimen and one day for performing the test, the developed ELISA should become a valuable diagnostic test for typhoid fever."

An attempt to define the diagnostic titer for upper Egypt.,"The study embodied 45 children with enteric fevers proved by bacteriological culture of blood, stools and urine and 20 children with rheumatic fever. Widal test was done for the rheumatic fever cases and was done repeatedly at weekly intervals for the enteric fever cases. The clinical features of children with enteric fevers was discussed. By contrasting the results of Widal test in children with enteric fever with the results in apparently normal infants and children from the same locality, a minimal diagnostic dual Widal titer was suggested. This combines ""O"" agglutinin in a titer of 1/160 provided that the other ""H"" agglutinins are at a lower titer. This suggested diagnostic titer improved the specificity of Widal test. This titer is encountered only in 0.58% of normal individuals and in none of 20 children with rheumatic fever. This titer also yielded an excellent sensitivity to diagnose actual enteric fever cases reaching up to 93.3%. Bacterial isolates from enteric fever cases were S. typhi in 55.5%, S. paratyphi A in 33.3% and S. paratyphi B in 11.1%. Chloramphenicol therapy resulted in a higher cure rate and a more rapid defervescence than ampicillin therapy. Regarding the effect of these antibiotic therapies on the rise of Widal agglutinin titers in children with enteric fevers there are two observations : 1--A four fold rise, is uncommon. A two fold rise is the common finding. 2--There is no consistent difference between chloramphenicol and ampicillin as regards their effect on the rise of agglutinin titers."

CD008892,0,12016210,0,A novel connection between the yeast Cdc42 GTPase and the Slt2-mediated cell integrity pathway identified through the effect of secreted Salmonella GTPase modulators.,"Modulation of host cellular GTPases through the injection of the effector proteins SopE2 and SptP is essential for Salmonella typhimurium to enter into non-phagocytic cells. Here we show that expression of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42 SopE2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to the activation of Fus3 and Kss1 MAPKs, which operate in the mating and filamentation pathways, causing filamentous growth in haploid yeast cells. Furthermore, it promotes the activation of the cell integrity MAPK Slt2. Cdc42 activation by removal of its putative intrinsic GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), Rga1, Rga2, and Bem3, also results in the phosphorylation of Kss1, Fus3, and Slt2 MAPKs. These data support the role of these GAP proteins as negative regulators of Cdc42, confirm the modulating effect of this GTPase on the filamentation and mating pathways and point to a novel connection between Cdc42 and the cell integrity pathway. Cdc42-induced activation of Slt2 occurs in a mating and filamentation pathway-dependent manner, but it does not require the function of Rho1, which is the GTPase that operates in the cell integrity pathway. Moreover, we report that Salmonella SptP can act as a GAP for Cdc42 in S. cerevisiae, down-regulating MAPK-mediated signaling. Thus, yeast provides a useful system to study the interaction of bacterial pathogenic proteins with eukaryotic signaling pathways. Furthermore, these proteins can be used as a tool to gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate MAPK-mediated signaling in eukaryotes."

This study was undertaken to determine the current pattern of resistance to antimicrobial agents and phage types of S.Typhi isolates obtained in a tertiary health care hospital in Pondicherry. Blood culture was done for 1296 suspected cases of enteric fever and 157 strains of S. Typhi were isolated. Sensitivity to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone was determined by disc diffusion, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin determined. There were 61 multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates. The MIC of ciprofloxacin for 147 isolates was >0.5 mg/l; of these, 131 were resistant to nalidixic acid. Phage typing was done for 123 isolates and 115 were found to be of phage type E1, biotype 1. A decline in the number of MDR isolates was noted. Concurrently, there has been an increase in the number of isolates sensitive to all antibiotics except nalidixic acid, and all these isolates showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Nalidixic acid susceptibility could be a useful screening test for the detection of decreased susceptibility of S. Typhi to ciprofloxacin. The clinicians should be advised to use ceftriaxone selectively in cases showing non-responsiveness to ciprofloxacin."

TYPHIDOT®, a rapid dot enzyme immunoassay test for typhoid, was developed from the discovery of a ∼50 kDa protein specific for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. However, the structure of this antigen remains unknown till today. Studies on the structure of this antigen are important to elucidate its function, which will in turn increase the efficiency of the development and improvement of the typhoid detection test. This paper described the predictive structure and function of the antigenically specific protein. The homology modeling approach was employed to construct the three-dimensional structure of the antigen. The built structure possesses the features of TolC-like outer membrane protein. Molecular docking simulation was also performed to further probe the functionality of the antigen. Docking results showed that hexamminecobalt, Co(NH(3))(6)(3+), as an inhibitor of TolC protein, formed favorable hydrogen bonds with D368 and D371 of the antigen. The single point (D368A, D371A) and double point (D368A and D371A) mutations of the antigen showed a decrease (single point mutation) and loss (double point mutations) of binding affinity towards hexamminecobalt. The architecture features of the built model and the docking simulation reinforced and supported that this antigen is indeed the variant of outer membrane protein, TolC. As channel proteins are important for the virulence and survival of bacteria, therefore this ∼50 kDa channel protein is a good specific target for typhoid detection test."

CD008892,0,8586858,0,Evaluation of GiardEIA kit for giardiasis diagnosis.,"Giardia lamblia is recognized as one of the most common agents for diarrhea world wide. To date, microscopical examination of stool samples is the gold standard for giardiasis diagnosis. However, intermittence of the Giardia cycle and some medications may cause temporary disappearance of cysts from stools, thus giving false negative results. In the present study, we evaluated a commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit (GiardEIA) for the detection of Giardia copro-antigens and compared the results with those of the merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde concentration (MIFC) microscopical examination technique. Sixty-nine fecal samples from children 2-12 years old were emulsified and allowed to react with a Giardia specific antibody, then with an enzyme conjugated antibody and the reaction was developed colorimetrically. Seventy-four percent of the parasitologically positive Giardia cases were also positive by GiardEIA while 26% of the microscopically negative cases were positive by the assay. GiardEIA gave negative results with 82% and 100% of stools with helminthic and protozoan (other than Giardia) infections, respectively. Similarly, no cross-reactivity was found with any of the bacterial agents including Shigella flexneri, pathogenic E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Salmonella typhi. GiardEIA is a simple assay that can diagnose 24 samples in less than an hour without the need for any special equipment and can be useful in epidemiological surveys and in giardiasis outbreaks."

Medical history and anthropometrical data were assessed using a standardized questionnaire at admission. Incidences were calculated after considering the coverage population adjusted for village-dependent health-seeking behavior.Among 1,196 hospitalized children, 19.9% (n = 238) were blood culture positive. The four most frequent isolated pathogens were nontyphoidal salmonellae (NTS) (53.3%; n = 129), Staphylococcus aureus (13.2%; n = 32), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.1%; n = 22) and Salmonella ser. Typhi (7.0%; n = 17). Yearly cumulative incidence of bacteremia was 46.6 cases/1,000 (CI 40.9-52.2). Yearly cumulative incidences per 1,000 of the four most frequent isolates were 25.2 (CI 21.1-29.4) for NTS, 6.3 (CI 4.1-8.4) for S. aureus, 4.3 (CI 2.5-6.1) for S. pneumoniae and 3.3 (CI 1.8-4.9) for Salmonella ser. Typhi. Wasting was positively associated with bacteremia and systemic NTS bloodstream infection. Children older than three months had more often NTS bacteremia than younger children. Ninety-eight percent of NTS and 100% of Salmonella ser. Typhi isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, whereas both tested 100% susceptible to ceftriaxone. Seventy-seven percent of NTS and 65% of Salmonella ser. Typhi isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR). Systemic bacterial infections in nearly 20% of hospitalized children underline the need for microbiological diagnostics, to guide targeted antimicrobial treatment and prevention of bacteremia. If microbiological diagnostics are lacking, calculated antimicrobial treatment of severely ill children in malaria-endemic areas should be considered."

In all, 18 patients with clinical symptoms and 8 asymptomatic carriers were registered. However, 1 1/2 months elapsed before the etiologic diagnosis could be established. The infection was then transmitted, probably by a visiting nurse, to the personnel of a neighbouring school. An outbreak followed thereafter including 31 clinically manifest patients and 10 asymptomatic carriers. Infected food was most probably responsible for the dissemination of the disease, since two asymptomatic carriers were detected among persons engaged in the preparation of food. The close correlation between the two epidemics was confirmed by phague typing of isolated Salmonella strains according to the method of GUINEE. A common Biotype I, Lysotype 650, was identified in all cases. Clinical findings revealed diarrhea in 77,6%, fever in 59,2% and vomiting in 18.4% of cases. Only two patients who were admitted to the hospital, were given chemotherapy. The excretion of Salmonellae in the stools was observed on average for about one month in clinical cases and for 12 days in asymptomatic carriers. All the strains, with one exception, were in vitro sensitive against tetracycline, Chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In one case the tetracycline treatment resulted in homologous resistance. In this case the carrier state had been observed for 111 days. Serologic tests were made one month after the outbreak was detected using Widal reactions with antigens of homologous strain. In most patients with clinical symptoms antibody titers were at serum dilutions of more than 1:80, whereas only 4 of the 9 asymptomatic carriers investigated presented with titers in this range. Patients who were not excreting Salmonellae had uniform antibody titers of less than 1:80."

There is no apparent relationship between the presence of antigen and antibodies in the sera, and no apparent relationship between the CIE antibody and Widal antibody titres."
CD008892,0,11925996,0,The increase in occurrence of typhoid fever in Cameroon: overdiagnosis due to misuse of the Widal test?,"This study investigates the cause of an apparent increase in occurrence of typhoid fever in Cameroon. The reasons explored include an overdiagnosis of the illness related to poor performance of the Widal test in laboratories and interpretation by prescribers. Questionnaires were used in 1996 to evaluate the use and interpretation of the Widal test, and checklists were used to assess its laboratory performance in 2 of the 10 provinces in Cameroon. The majority of prescribers from 20 health facilities (an average of 76% of the doctors and 61% of the nurses) could detect patients who truly had positive Widal tests and needed treatment. However, an average of 48% of the doctors and 84% of the nurses would treat patients who did not require treatment based on the Widal test result. Patients may therefore be treated unnecessarily. Most (88%) of the visited laboratories performed the Widal rapid slide agglutination test as opposed to the conventional tube agglutination test. About 14% of the laboratories that performed the rapid slide agglutination test had a score above average for each criterion evaluated. Misdiagnosis of typhoid fever leads to unnecessary expenditure and exposure of patients to the side-effects of antibiotics. In addition, misdiagnosis may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of malaria, and other acute febrile illness."

Out of a total of 10 patients with both conditions, six were diagnosed of AIDS, three of AIDS related complex, and one presented an asymptomatic HIV infection. The mean age was 32.9 years (range 22 to 56). Eight of them were males, seven were intravenous drug addicts, and three were homosexual. Fever was observed in all cases and diarrhea in four of them. Salmonella enteritidis was isolated from the blood culture of nine patients and salmonella typhimurium from one. Salmonella enteritidis was isolated from the stool culture of 5 patients and Salmonella typhimurium and Campylobacter from the stool culture of one patient. Of the 10 patients 6 have died, 4 of them within the three weeks after the diagnosis of Salmonella non-typhi bacteremia, 2 have not relapsed and two patients were lost during follow up."
CD008892,0,1495127,0,Diagnostic value of the Widal test for typhoid fever in Singapore.,"A study was conducted to assess the diagnostic value of the Widal test in patients with bacteraemic typhoid fever. The Widal test was carried out on 25 bacteriologically proven cases of typhoid fever and 50 patients with non-typhoid fever. All the patients with non-typhoid fever had an O agglutinin titre of less than 1:40, while 82% had an H agglutinin titre of less than 1:40. In the patients with typhoid fever, 56% had an O agglutinin titre of greater than or equal to 1:40 and 72% had an H agglutinin titre of greater than or equal to 1:40. Typhoid patients with titres greater than or equal to 1:40 for O and H antigens of Salmonella typhi were significantly different (P less than 0.01) from those with non-typhoid fever. The O agglutinin was highly specific (100%) in the diagnosis of the disease. The study shows that a single Widal test is useful in the diagnosis of typhoid fever in Singapore."

A retrospective review of the multidrug resistant typhoid fever cases admitted to the paediatrics ward of JIPMER Hospital, Pondicherry (India) during 1990 is presented. Prolonged pyrexia, chills and rigors, toxaemia, and tender hepatomegaly often more than 3 cm below the costal margin (often without splenomegaly) were striking features of MDRT cases. The incidence of complications was also greater. Positive blood cultures were observed even after weeks of antibiotic therapy, indicating persistent bacteraemia; resistance was almost always observed for multiple drugs (two or more). The fluoroquinolone group of drugs such as ciprofloxacin have been found to be the best for MDRT in terms of rapid response and cost effectiveness. Cefotaxime has moderate efficacy."

Sixty-eight cultures were Salmonella typhi positive and 29 were positive for S. paratyphi A in at least one of the systems. Analysis of the isolation rates of the 97 Salmonella-positive specimens showed that BILE-BLOOD was significantly more sensitive (p less than 0.05) than either TSB-SPS or BILE-CLOTS, and that the latter two were not significantly different. The time required for positive results was shortest in BLOOD-BILE which was significantly quicker than BILE-CLOTs (p less than 0.05), but not TSB-SPS (p greater than 0.05). Possible explanations for the observed, superior performance of the BILE-BLOOD system are discussed and recommendations for efficient recovery of enteric fever salmonellae from blood are presented."

CD008892,0,13976889,0,O-I phage lysis in Salmonella species in India.,"A total of 794 Salmonella strains, of 26 serotypes prevalent in India, were examined for sensitivity to O-I phage. Of 597 Salm. typhi strains, 13.6% proved resistant to phage lysis. Other serotypes which contained resistant strains are Salm. anatum, Salm. paratyphi A, Salm. typhimurium, Salm. chester, Salm. colombo and Salm. matopeni. The specificity of O-I phage lysis against other Enterobacteriaceae was also tested. The results of the study suggest that resistance to O-I phage lysis in Salmonella is more frequent than earlier studies have indicated, and that O-I phage lysis is highly specific for salmonellae and should be useful for the detection of new Salmonella serotypes."
CD008892,0,14513391,0,Rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever by PCR assay using one pair of primers from flagellin gene of Salmonella typhi.,"Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, we developed a rapid diagnosis method for Salmonella typhi infection in blood specimens from patients with typhoid fever. Primers were designed from the flagellin gene sequence, which would give an amplification product of 367 base pairs. In this study, the specificity of the assay, with no amplification, was seen for the other Salmonella strains with the flagellin gene, and not for non- Salmonella bacteria. For the sensitivity test, the protocol described allowed the detection of two to three copies of the Salmonella typhi genome, as determined by serial dilution of genomic DNA from Salmonella typhi. With the PCR technique, genomic DNA of Salmonella typhi was detected in 46 of 73 blood samples collected from patients with clinically suspected typhoid fever who had fever within 3 days of admission to the General Hospital, Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and who had had no prior antibiotic treatment. The PCR results (63% positive cases) were compared with those of blood culture (13.7% positive cases) and the Widal test (35.6% positive cases), using the same samples from each of the 73 patients admitted to the General Hospital in Makassar. The time taken for PCR analysis of each sample was less than 12 h, compared with 3 to 5 days for blood or clot culture. The PCR with one pair of primers can be used as a novel, rapid diagnostic method for typhoid fever, particularly when results of standard culture assays are negative."

Blood culture specimens, with and without added growth supplements, were inoculated with study organism concentrations ranging from approximately 300 to as few as 1 to 2 CFU/10 ml culture and processed in a Bactec 9240 fluorescent series aerobic blood culture system. All cultures seeded with >6 CFU and 93% of cultures seeded with ∼1 to 2 CFU were identified as positive for microbial growth within 44 h of incubation. The results were within the performance standard of ≤5 days to detection that is expected for Gram-negative cultures seeded at 10 to 50 CFU/vial. Recovery of test organisms from blood culture was not improved by the addition of supplements, but cultures with added supplements were identified positive an average of 5 h sooner than those without added supplements. Reliable detection of the investigational vaccine strains at <1 CFU/ml of blood within 2 days in conventional blood culture without added supplements allowed for shortened confinement time of study volunteers without compromising subject safety."

It was isolated from 34.4, 4.9 and 4.1 per cent patients by blood culture, stool culture and by both respectively. The in vitro drug susceptibility testing showed that all the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, but were uniformly susceptible to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and furazolidone. In view of the appearance of multi-drug resistant S. typhi in Calcutta, great care should be exercised in the use of newer quinolone derivatives."
CD008892,0,1431177,0,Eradication of a multiple drug resistant Salmonella paratyphi A causing meningitis with ciprofloxacin.,"A previously healthy breast-fed baby was admitted at 10 days of age to a hospital in the north of Pakistan with diarrhoea and fever. He was treated for suspected sepsis with intravenous cefotaxime and tobramycin. Cultures of blood and faeces at that time proved negative. At 12 days of age, seizures began and examination of CSF revealed evidence of pyogenic meningitis but bacteria were neither seen microscopically nor isolated in culture. Ceftazidime was substituted for cefotaxime and carbenicillin was given also. Since the baby's condition continued to deteriorate with persistent fever, vomiting and recurrent seizures, he was transferred to the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Examination of CSF there confirmed the diagnosis of pyogenic meningitis and revealed Gram-negative bacteria. Cultures of CSF and faeces yielded Salmonella paratyphi A but the blood culture was negative. The isolate was found to be multiple antimicrobially resistant but sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Treatment with this drug was therefore started 3 days after the baby's admission to the Aga Khan Hospital. Within 36 h, improvement was observed. From then onwards, the baby made a progressive recovery and was healthy when seen at 7 months of age."

Two of the patients were referred for medical management as a last resort after open surgical drainage failed to eradicate the suppurative process. The other two patients were treated from the time of diagnosis with antimicrobial agents alone. Blood cultures or needle aspirates of the abscesses yielded a pure growth of streptococci in all instances. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin G.

The antigen-antibody reaction is visualized with a color reaction caused by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated class-specific anti-immunoglobins. This method was used to study the immunoglobulin G, A, and M immune response to Salmonella typhi O antigen in individuals immunized with a monovalent heat-inactivated typhoid vaccine. The antibody values obtained by the DIG-ELISA method correlated with those evaluated by conventional direct agglutination (Widal) and indirect hemagglutination methods. The DIG-ELISA method was also found to be sensitive, specific, and economical, as well as suitable for handling large numbers of sera while requiring very simple equipment."
CD008892,0,7644481,0,Selenophosphate synthetase: detection in extracts of rat tissues by immunoblot assay and partial purification of the enzyme from the archaean Methanococcus vannielii.,"In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium it has been shown that selenophosphate serves as the selenium donor for the conversion of seryl-tRNA to selenocysteyl-tRNA and for the synthesis of 2-selenouridine, a modified nucleoside present in tRNAs. Although selenocysteyl-tRNA also is formed in eukaryotes and is used for the specific insertion of selenocysteine into proteins, the precise mechanism of its biosynthesis from seryl-tRNA in these systems is not known. Because selenophosphate is extremely oxygen labile and difficult to identify in biological systems, we used an immunological approach to detect the possible presence of selenophosphate synthetase in mammalian tissues. With antibodies elicited to E. coli selenophosphate synthetase the enzyme was detected in extracts of rat brain, liver, kidney, and lung by immunoblotting. Especially high levels were detected in Methanococcus vannielii, a member of the domain Archaea, and the enzyme was partially purified from this source. It seems likely that the use of selenophosphate as a selenium donor is widespread in biological systems."

These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae.

Median minimum inhibitory concentrations of all strains to oxolinic acid were 0.39 mug/ml; ampicillin, 6.25 mug/ml; amoxicillin, 0.39 mug/ml. Widespread typhoid fever appeared in mid-1973 with more than three-fourths of strains found to be resistant to chloramphenicol. Peak serum concentrations of oxolinic acid average 3.0 mug/ml after the oral ingestion of 1.0 g. In July 1974, a pilot study was begun to evaluate the efficacy of oxolinic acid in vivo, recognizing the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo results with many agents evaluated in the treatment of typhoid fever. Seven patients with typhoid fever, six with positive blood cultures, were treated with oxolinic acid (1.5 g twice daily by mouth, a daily dose that averaged 75 mg/kg per day) for 5 to 12 days. In four of six patients, blood cultures became negative at 2 to 3 days, with another being negative at 6 days. Despite negative blood cultures, all but one patient remained clinically ill with temperatures of >39.5 C at 4 to 9 days.

One (49%) or dual with C. difficile (23%) enteric pathogens associated with community-acquired diarrhoea (58% bacteria and 14% viruses) in 31 (72%) children were recognized. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) (18,6%) and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (16,3%) the most commonly were observed. Children were considered to have CDAD if they met special criteria such as the positive test for C. difficile toxin A, the presence of diarrhoea for at least 2 days and no other documented enteric pathogens. It was be found that antibiotic usage in the previous 3 weeks as a main risk factor for CDAD not be frequent (only 2/8 CDAD). The frequency of C. difficile toxin A detection in the diarrhoeal stool specimens from children treated or not treated with antibiotics was comparable (p>0,05); this same observed when stool specimens from children without diarrhoea were tested. The frequency of toxin A detection in stool specimens from children with acute diarrhoea (41,9%) and without diarrhoea (54,8%) was comparable (p>0,05) also. In conclusion, we recommended detection of toxin A by C. difficile toxin A Test as the rapid screening in diarrhoeal stool specimens only because the high predictive value of a negative test and the high sensitivity for CDAD with special criteria were found."

Thalidomide was not mutagenic to 6 strains of Salmonella when tested both in the presence and absence of Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 mix. This inactivity was confirmed in strains TA98 and TA100 using a 1-h pre-incubation assay protocol with the same S9 mix (10% S9), and additionally, in strain TA98 using 3 concentrations of S9 (4%, 10% and 30% S9 in S9 mix). Thalidomide was not clastogenic either to cultured human lymphocytes (whole blood cultures, minus S9 mix) or to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells treated in vitro. Further, no cytotoxicity was observed in purified human lymphocytes when exposed to thalidomide up to the limit of its solubility in the medium in the presence and absence of liver S9 from Aroclor-induced pregnant rabbit. The CHO assays were conducted without metabolic activation and in the presence of a variety of sources of auxiliary metabolic activation (PB/beta NP-induced rat liver S9 mix, pooled male and female human liver S9 mix, uninduced and Aroclor-induced pregnant rabbit liver S9 mix and foetal rabbit S9 mix). Thalidomide did not induce micronuclei in isolated human lymphocytes (minus S9 mix) and it was non-mutagenic to mouse lymphoma L5178Y TK+/- cells when tested to the limits of its solubility in the culture medium (+/- S9 mix). No indication of recombinogenic or clastogenic activity was observed for thalidomide when tested in Drosophila. In addition, it failed to induce chromosome aberrations in grasshopper neuroblasts when tested in the presence and absence of Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 mix. Some unusual chromosome morphologies were observed in the grasshopper cytogenetic preparations indicating a potential of thalidomide to interact with chromosomal proteins. However, this potential was not evident in the human lymphocyte micronucleus assay, and thalidomide was apparently not reactive to the proteins of the mouse skin, as it gave negative results in a mouse local lymph node assay for skin sensitizing agents. Thalidomide was inactive in bone marrow micronucleus assays conducted using males and females from two strains of mice, and female New Zealand white rabbits. It is concluded that thalidomide is neither a mutagen nor an aneugen. This conclusion is discussed within the context of the results of earlier mutagenicity studies, the recent claim that thalidomide may be a heritable germ cell mutagen to humans, and the current interest in thalidomide for the treatment of immune system-related diseases."
CD008892,0,2273260,0,A one-step two-particle latex immunoassay for the detection of Salmonella typhi endotoxin.,"A simple and rapid test (LIMM, short for latex immunoassay) is described for detecting Salmonella typhi endotoxin. It involves the simultaneous binding of the antigen by two types of reagent particles contained in a micro-tube: an indicator latex particle coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the O-9 determinant on the endotoxin, and a magnetic bead coated with another monoclonal antibody specific for a different O-determinant. At the end of-the test, the magnetic beads are sedimented by use of a magnet, and the result is read based on the turbidity of the indicator latex suspension. Compared to a similar assay developed previously which uses only a single particle reagent (i.e., a tube agglutination system), LIMM was found to be slightly more sensitive especially when using short (less than 30 min) incubation times, and was at all times easier to read. The sensitivity of LIMM, in fact, increased with increasing time of incubation. When compared to the sensitivity (25 ng/ml) of a conventional slide latex agglutination test performed using the same indicator latex reagent, this parameter was 0-, 4.9-, 12.5- and 28.7-fold better after 5, 15, 30 and 60 min of incubation in the LIMM."

However, long before these recent developments serum reactivity played its role in diagnosing, active or previous severe bacterial infection in diseases such as typhoid fever (Widal), brucellosis (Wright test), syphilis (VDRL, Wassermann test), typhus (Weil-Felix test) etc. From early infection to immunity, serology analyzes the patient's immunological memory enabling the fight against infections. The resulting information depends on the type of pathogen, the site of infection, the host and the stage of disease. Together with the direct tests for the detection of pathogens, serological tests form the basis of microbiological diagnosis.

In the pilot study, involving 274 Nepalese, there were no significant side effects of the Vi vaccine; about 75 percent responded with a rise in serum antibodies of fourfold or more. In the clinical trial, residents of five villages were given intramuscular injections of either Vi or, as a control, pneumococcus vaccine dispensed in coded, randomly arranged, single-dose syringes. There were 6907 participants, of whom 6438 were members of the target population (5 to 44 years of age); each was visited every two days. Those with temperatures of 37.8 degrees C or higher for three consecutive days were examined and asked to give blood for culture. Typhoid was diagnosed as either blood culture-positive or clinically suspected on the basis of bradycardia, splenomegaly, and fever, with a negative blood culture. Seventeen months after vaccination, the codes were broken for the 71 patients meeting the criteria for either culture-positive or clinically suspected typhoid. The attack rate of typhoid was 16.2 per 1000 among the controls and 4.1 per 1000 among those immunized with Vi (P less than 0.00001). The efficacy of Vi was 72 percent in the culture-positive cases, 80 percent in the clinically suspected cases, and 75 percent in the two groups combined.

CD008892,0,22051544,0,Highly sensitive detection of Salmonella typhi using surface aminated polycarbonate membrane enhanced-ELISA.,"The identification of pathogenic bacteria in water is important for addressing preventive and treatment issues regarding health and safety. A highly sensitive and specific solid-phase sandwich ELISA procedure was developed for the detection of typhoid causing extremely lethal water borne pathogen Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) on modified isopore polycarbonate (PC) black membranes. PC membranes were chemically derivatized to generate amino groups on the surface maintaining their pysico-optico properties. Surface modified PC membranes were characterized by ATR-FTIR spectrometer, goniometer and scanning electron microscope. Polyclonal somatic 'O' type antibodies (Abs) against whole cell S. typhi were immobilized on them by following the amine glutaraldehyde chemistry. Antibody immobilized membranes captured S. typhi from buffer solution and this complex was detected colourimetrically using HRP labelled S. typhi Ab. A detection limit of 2×10(3)cells/ml of bacteria was achieved with the modified PC membranes without any pre-enrichment step as against 10(6)-10(7)CFU/ml of bacteria by typical ELISA method. The assay was demonstrated to be specific for the target bacteria when compared with other cross-reactant water borne pathogens. The intra- and inter-assay precision for 10(4) and 10(5)cells/ml was 5.3-7.4 and 10.3-19.7% respectively. The developed immunoassay for the detection of S. typhi is simple, easy to handle, sensitive specific, reproducible and cost effective in comparison with the commercially existing immunochromatographic assays."

In 331/536 (61.8%) health facilities, clinicians diagnosed TF by clinical picture and the Widal test. An EQA on the Widal test consisting of three samples revealed correct scores by respectively 27.1%, 65.6% and 3.1% of 125 participating laboratories. Most (80.9% of 152 laboratories) performed <100 Widal tests per month, with a median sample positivity rate of 32.6% (range 0-90.7%). The Widal test was mostly performed on a single sample and by slide agglutination (89.5% and 97.0% respectively); errors in cold chain and procedures were recorded (not making serial dilutions, estimating titres by the intensity of agglutination). Among 293 prescribers, 52.2% and 40.8% requested the Widal test for treatment follow-up and detection of chronic carriers respectively. Salmonella Typhi was recovered from the blood in 2.4% of 3820 patients suspected as having TF, with non-typhoid Salmonellae and other Enterobacteriaceae accounting for the majority of organisms. In conclusion, clinicians rely highly on the Widal test for the diagnosis of TF and the Widal test is poorly performed and interpreted."

CD008892,0,6761267,0,The protective capacity of immune sera in experimental mouse salmonellosis is mainly due to IgM antibodies.,"Passive immunization was used to protect mice against a general infection caused by Salmonella typhimurium and our purpose was to compare the protective capacity of different immunoglobulin isotypes (classes and subclasses). Three antisera were studied, one pool of mouse serum against the envelope of rough bacteria, and two rabbit sera against smooth bacteria. Three different methods were used to separate isotypes. The consistent finding was that only IgM antibodies protected efficiently. A unit of IgG antibodies had an effect that was 1/50th of the IgM effect or less. This effect could have been due to a contamination by IgM. IgA appears to be non-protective like IgG. In two of the antisera a considerable proportion of protective antibodies were against a defined antigenic determinant (anti-0-4,5 or anti-0-9). IgG antibodies of these sera measured by the solid phase assay were also predominantly anti-0-4,5 or anti-0-9, respectively. This argues that the failure of IgG antibodies to protect cannot be explained by assuming that unlike IgM antibodies they are directed against ""non-protective"" determinants. We conclude that the observed difference between the protective capacities of IgM and IgG antibodies is due to C-region differences between the mu- and gamma-chains."

Using the combination of these specific MAbs and recombinant DNA technology, expression plasmids containing the antigen gene producing substantial amount of the S. typhi protein antigen have been established. Plasmid pSKM-T7 containing the specific 52 kDa antigen gene was cloned and the antigen expressed was detectable by immunoblotting using specific mAbs. The complete nucleotide sequence of this gene was compared with other bacterial sequences and found to be highly homologous with the flagellin gene H1-d of S. muenchen except in the hypervariable region in the central portion. The specific 52 kDa antigen of S. typhi detected by our MAbs is thus a flagellin."
CD008892,0,7505314,0,Induction of nitric oxide synthase in rat C6 glioma cells.,"We have examined the induction of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in the rat astrocyte-derived C6 glioma cell line. In contrast to the previous results with primary astrocyte cultures, incubation of C6 cells with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 microgram/ml for 24 h) did not stimulate NO2 production. However, addition of either tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), cytokines that by themselves had no effect on NOS activity, imparted LPS responsiveness onto these cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 values of 39 ng/ml of TNF-alpha and 9.4 U/ml of IFN-gamma), and the effect of TNF-alpha could be further potentiated (twofold) by the presence of interleukin-1 beta. The simultaneous presence of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma yielded a greater response than either cytokine alone; however, the respective EC50 values were not affected. A cytoplasmic extract from induced C6 cells catalyzed the Ca(2+)-independent conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, with an apparent Km of 51.2 microM, and this activity could be blocked by L-arginine analogues in the potency order amino > methyl > nitroarginine. Immunoblot analysis revealed an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa for the NOS protein induced in C6 cells. These results indicate that the combination of LPS plus cytokines can induce NOS activity in C6 glioma cells with properties similar to those of the enzyme expressed in primary astrocyte cultures."

After infection with recombinant S. typhimurium, maximal numbers of bacteria were recovered from the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens during the second week postinfection. By weeks 3-4, bacteria were absent from these tissues. Splenocytes from mice infected with S. typhimurium expressing OvGST showed significant and specific proliferative responses to OvGST, whereas the non-recombinant S. typhimurium controls and those which received the antigen by subcutaneous injection with Freund's adjuvant did not. Mice infected with recombinant S. typhimurium had elevated IFN-gamma levels over non-recombinant S. typhimurium and placebo controls. but IL-4 and IL-5 levels were low and did not differ significantly between these groups. Antibody responses to OvGST antigen expressed by a recombinant Salmonella vaccine or delivered in a purified form with Freund's adjuvant were moderate to high. These data suggest that Salmonella can be used as a vaccine delivery vector that induces specific cellular and humoral immune responses to Onchocerca volvulus antigens. This is the first report to describe the successful application of a filarial antigen in a live-vector delivery system as well as the first recombinant based filarial vaccine to elicit a cellular immune response similar to that described for putative immune endemics."

Blood samples were cultured and identification of Salmonella species. and their antibiotic susceptibility testing were done as per standard protocol. Of the total 114 (4.8 %) yielded Salmonella species. Of them 76 (66.7%) Salmonella typhi and 38 (33.3%) S. paratyphi A. S. typhi was found to be the predominant species each year. Higher proportion of Salmonella bacteraemia was seen in adults, with a clearcut male to female preponderance (1.8:1). Monsoons enhanced the risk of acquiring enteric fever. There is also a rise in the number of multi-drug resistant strains in and around Pokhara Valley, with 40.7% S. typhi and 5.2% S. paratyphi A showing resistance to two or more antibiotics. These isolates were primarily resistant to the first line drugs namely Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol and Cotrimoxazole but susceptible to third generation Cephalosporins. Appearance of multi drug resistance poses considerable threat of increased morbidity and mortality in this region. This emphasizes the need for prudent use of antimicrobials."
CD008892,0,9522872,0,The new problem of typhoid fever in Papua New Guinea: how do we deal with it?,"This paper reviews some of the issues relating to typhoid fever in Papua New Guinea. Before the mid-1980s only sporadic cases of typhoid were reported but it is now one of the greatest public health problems in the highlands and some urban areas. In one study near Goroka an annual incidence rate of 1208 per 100,000 people was found, with settlers from other areas at greater risk than the local landowners. Problems relating to management included differentiation from other diseases, the limitations of the Widal test and poor compliance among outpatients. In Papua New Guinea it appears that transmission is largely from person to person, with little evidence for water-borne transmission. The prolonged convalescent excretion of Salmonella typhi and the difficulties this poses for control of the disease are discussed. Prevention will only be achieved in the long term by improvements in hygiene and sanitation, though more immediate control could be achieved by vaccination with an appropriate vaccine."
CD008892,0,9522873,0,Typhoid in the highlands of Papua New Guinea 1984-1990: a hospital-based perspective.,"A first-hand account is given of the epidemic of typhoid in the Goroka area as it evolved from 1984 to 1990. The monthly admissions for typhoid to Goroka Base Hospital showed a peak in 1988. The sex and age distribution showed a predominance of young adults. The overall case fatality rate of hospitalized patients was of the order of 10-15%; in a carefully documented group of 374 patients 27% were assessed as having severe typhoid and this subgroup had a case fatality rate of 44%. The clinical features were studied in 516 patients. The high mortality appeared to result from septic shock; ileal perforation was found in only 1.3% of patients. A skin lesion equivalent to but significantly different from the classic rose spot was found in 30% of patients. The typhoid facies was commonly encountered in patients with well-established typhoid. Cerebellar tremor and hearing loss were frequent diagnostic findings. Blood and bone marrow cultures were used to confirm the diagnosis; bone marrow culture proved practicable but gave little increased yield over blood culture. A clinical algorithm to help distinguish typhoid and malaria was developed, principally for use in health centres in the highlands. The mainstay of treatment was chloramphenicol and very few problems were encountered with its use in inpatients. Bacteriological resistance to chloramphenicol did not develop over the study period. Other drugs, such as fluorinated quinolones, may be more effective when all aspects are considered, despite higher cost, but this remains to be investigated. Hydrocortisone in patients with severe disease was evaluated and shown to be ineffective but whether high-dose dexamethasone would reduce the mortality from typhoid in patients in Papua New Guinea still remains an unanswered question."
CD008892,0,9522874,0,The role of the laboratory in the diagnosis and management of typhoid fever.,"In typhoid-endemic areas the results obtained from the laboratory are important in confirming the clinical diagnosis of typhoid and may also contribute to decisions made on the management and treatment of typhoid cases. Isolation of Salmonella typhi remains the gold standard, with culture from bone marrow aspirate or a combination of specimens from other body sites resulting in the greatest sensitivity. Antibody detection techniques may still provide valuable information, but only if the results are interpreted in the context of the background antibody levels in the local population. None of the available antigen detection techniques have been consistently demonstrated to be of diagnostic value and a recently developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of Salmonella typhi has yet to undergo a full-scale clinical evaluation. The initial identification of chronic typhoid carriers relies upon the detection of elevated Vi capsular antibody levels, but seeking out chronic carriers will be of limited value in controlling the spread of typhoid in areas where transmission is principally mediated by convalescent excretors. Whilst resistance of Salmonella typhi to antibiotics has emerged as an increasing problem in some areas of the world, it is still uncommon in isolates from Papua New Guinea. However, monitoring of antibiotic susceptibility patterns will ensure that signs of developing resistance are detected early and that the appropriate action is taken."

Older children and young adults had the highest age-specific rates of disease. The clinical, epidemiological and laboratory features of patients with enteric fever were compared with similar information from patients in hospital for cholera and shigellosis. Patients with enteric fever had a significantly longer prodrome of illness and were more likely to have fever than patients in the other groups. Our hospital cares primarily for patients with diarrhoeal diseases and while 94% of enteric fever patients had diarrhoea, only 5% had the recognized diarrhoeal pathogens Shigella or Vibrio cholerae identified, compared to 25% of the total hospital in-patient group, suggesting that Salmonella typhi itself may be a cause of diarrhoea. Antibiotic resistance patterns of S. typhi isolates were reviewed, and one isolate was found to be multiply antibiotic resistant. The advent of an effective oral typhoid vaccine makes further work on the epidemiology of enteric fever in endemic areas such as Bangladesh a high priority."

The basic mechanism in developing salmonella co-infection is the impaired mobilization of granulocytes through heme and heme oxygenase which are released from haemoglobin due to the breakdown of erythrocytes during malaria infection. Thus, a malaria infected person becomes more susceptible to develop infection with Salmonella spp. In this report a case with Plasmodium falciparum and Salmonella Typhi co-infection was presented. A 23-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital with the complaints of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue and fever. Laboratory findings yielded decreased number of platelets and increased ALT, AST and CRP levels. Since he had a history of working in Pakistan, malaria infection was considered in differential diagnosis, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of P.falciparum trophozoites in the thick and thin blood smears. As he came from a region with chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium, quinine (3 x 650 mg) and doxycycline (2 x 100 mg/day) were started for the treatment. No erythrocytes, parasite eggs or fungal elements were seen at the stool microscopy of the patient who had diarrhoea during admission. No pathogenic microorganism growth was detected in his stool culture. The patient's blood cultures were also taken in febrile periods starting from the time of his hospitalization. A bacterial growth was observed in his blood cultures, and the isolate was identified as S. Typhi. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with P.falciparum and Salmonella Typhi coinfection. Ceftriaxone (1 x 2 g/day, 14 days) was added to the therapy according to the results of antibiotic susceptibility test. With the combined therapy (quinine, doxycycline, ceftriaxone) the fever was taken under control, his general condition improved and laboratory findings turned to normal values. However, on the fifth day of his anti-malaria therapy sudden bilateral hearing loss developed due to quinine use. Thus, the treatment was replaced with an artemisinin-based (arthemeter/lumefantrine) combination therapy. No adverse effects were detected due to artemisinin-based therapy, and the patient completely recovered. In conclusion, if a patient is diagnosed with malaria, he/she should be closely monitored in terms of having co-infections and appropriate diagnostic methods including blood cultures taken in febrile episodes should be performed."
CD008892,0,16697432,0,A simple validated prediction rule to diagnose typhoid fever in Turkey.,"The goal of this study was to develop a simple prediction rule for the diagnosis of typhoid fever. A model for the prediction of patients with typhoid fever at hospital admission was derived and validated by assigning weighted point values to independent predictive factors associated with a diagnosis of typhoid fever at hospital admission. Patient demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were used to compare patients with blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever with patients with fever of unknown origin. The model was derived and validated in two separate cohorts of patients from Dicle University Hospital in Diyarbakir, Turkey. A total of 371 patients were enrolled. A diagnostic index score was created using seven independent predictive factors associated with typhoid fever at hospital admission: age <30 years, abdominal distention, confusion, leukopenia, relative bradycardia, positive Widal test and a typhoid tongue. A clinical prediction rule helped to differentiate patients with typhoid fever."

CD008892,0,3511159,0,Typhoid fever: successful therapy with cefoperazone.,"We compared cefoperazone with chloramphenicol in a randomized trial involving the treatment of 25 children with severe typhoid fever. The clinical characteristics of the two treatment groups were comparable on entry into the study. Four patients died (three receiving chloramphenicol, one cefoperazone), and an additional two patients received dexamethasone (one per group). Excluding these six patients, the response of the cefoperazone group was comparable or superior to that of the chloramphenicol group in terms of the number of days from initiation of therapy to becoming afebrile (P less than .055) and the number of days until negative blood cultures were obtained (P less than .19). There were no relapses or treatment failures in either group. We conclude that cefoperazone is as effective as chloramphenicol in the treatment of severe typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,11681112,0,Changing trends in outcome of typhoid ileal perforations over three decades in Pondicherry.,"Two hundred and forty eight cases of proved typhoid ileal perforation were admitted and treated in three phases in the department of surgery during 1966-1998. Of these, 71% patients belonged to second and third decades of life. Male female ratio was 4:1. Abdominal pain (100%) fever (95%) and constipation (87%) were the main presenting symptoms. Abdominal guarding and rigidity (84%) were the principal physical signs. Plain radiograph of abdomen showed evidence of pneumoperitoneum in 57% of cases. The Widal test was positive for S. typhi in 74% of cases. Blood and bone marrow culture were positive for S. typhi in 9% and 30% respectively. Histology of the excised edges of perforation confirmed typhoid pathology in 62% of specimens. Many of the patients were treated conservatively in the first phase. In phase two and three vigorous resuscitation and early surgery was resorted to. Simple closure in two layers and wedge resection were the treatment of choice in most of the cases. Bypass, ileostomy and resection were done on few occasions. Chloramphenicol was the only drug used in the first phase. Other broad spectrum antibiotics were added to chloramphenicol with metranidazole in the second phase. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were the drugs of choice in the third phase. The mortality rate showed a dramatic improvement from 47.2% (first phase) to 17.7% (second phase) and as low as 7% in the last phase. The lag period (advent of symptoms to time of admission to hospital) showed definite correlation with mortality. Septicemia, wound infection, dehiscence, enterocutaneous fistula were the principal postoperative complications."

CD008892,0,25383971,0,Variation at HLA-DRB1 is associated with resistance to enteric fever.,"Enteric fever affects more than 25 million people annually and results from systemic infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi or Paratyphi pathovars A, B or C(1). We conducted a genome-wide association study of 432 individuals with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever and 2,011 controls from Vietnam. We observed strong association at rs7765379 (odds ratio (OR) for the minor allele = 0.18, P = 4.5 × 10(-10)), a marker mapping to the HLA class II region, in proximity to HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1. We replicated this association in 595 enteric fever cases and 386 controls from Nepal and also in a second independent collection of 151 cases and 668 controls from Vietnam. Imputation-based fine-mapping across the extended MHC region showed that the classical HLA-DRB1*04:05 allele (OR = 0.14, P = 2.60 × 10(-11)) could entirely explain the association at rs7765379, thus implicating HLA-DRB1 as a major contributor to resistance against enteric fever, presumably through antigen presentation."
CD008892,0,18456810,0,Effect of growth temperature on Crl-dependent regulation of sigmaS activity in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.,"The small regulatory protein Crl favors association of the stationary-phase sigma factor sigma(S) (RpoS) with the core enzyme polymerase and thereby increases sigma(S) activity. Crl has a major physiological impact at low levels of sigma(S). Here, we report that the Crl effects on sigma(S)-dependent gene expression, the H(2)O(2) resistance of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and the resistance of this organism to acidic pH are greater at 28 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. Immunoblot experiments revealed a negative correlation between sigma(S) and Crl levels; the production of Crl was slightly greater at 28 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, whereas the sigma(S) levels were about twofold lower at 28 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. At both temperatures, Crl was present in excess of sigma(S), and increasing the Crl level further did not increase the H(2)O(2) resistance level of Salmonella and the expression of the sigma(S)-dependent gene katE encoding the stationary-phase catalase. In contrast, increasing the sigma(S) level rendered Salmonella more resistant to H(2)O(2) at 28 degrees C, increased the expression of katE, and reduced the magnitude of Crl activation. In addition, the effect of Crl on katE transcription in vitro was not dependent on temperature. These results suggest that the effect of temperature on Crl-dependent regulation of the katE gene and H(2)O(2) resistance are mediated mainly via an effect on sigma(S) levels. In addition, our results revealed that sigma(S) exerts a negative effect on the production of Crl in stationary phase when the cells contain high levels of sigma(S)."

Typhi (OmpC and OmpF) was evaluated in sera of typhoid patients (culture positive, n = 28; Widal positive, n = 16). Sera from fever patients (n = 6) having etiology other than Salmonella, and normal healthy human controls (n = 18) were also included. No significant difference between the anti-OmpC and anti-OmpF antibodies (Ab) of typhoid patients and controls was observed. The amino acid sequences of OmpC (and OmpF) porin of enterobacteria was aligned and searched for the variable regions specific to S. Typhi. Two regions, each representing one specific variable region of OmpC and OmpF, were selected (peptides for these regions were custom synthesized). The peptides were evaluated for Ab response of sera. A significantly higher level of Ab to both the peptides was observed in the sera of typhoid patients. The findings suggest that porins of S. Typhi are cross reactive and are not good markers for Ab-based diagnosis of typhoid fever, however, peptides representing the variable regions specific to S. Typhi may have greater diagnostic potential."
CD008892,0,4014078,0,Coagglutination and counter immunoelectrophoresis in the rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever.,"The efficacy of two methods--coagglutination (COAG) and counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE)--in the rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever was studied in parallel with blood and clot cultures on 114 clinically suspected cases. Retrospective analysis showed that only 58 eventually were discharged and had typhoid fever. Antigen detection on their sera was done by both methods, concomitant with antigen detection on culture supernates by CIE. Sera from 50 controls were subjected to both tests. Agglutinating anti-serum being unsatisfactory in the CIE system, anti-serum to the LPS fraction of Salmonella typhi ""O"" 901 was used in both tests after absorption with Escherichia coli and Salmonella paratyphi A. Analysis of data with reference to retrospectively confirmed typhoid cases show that S. typhi was isolated in 58.6% and 58.3% of blood and clot cultures; antigen detection by CIE in their supernates was 81.1% and 79.2%, respectively. This correlated closely with serum COAG (81.0%) in contrast to serum CIE (5.7%). Thus, COAG was superior to CIE for serology. However, CIE done on culture supernates precludes such tedious procedures as absorption of staphylococcal agglutinins and the confirmatory blocking test."

However, in mammalian models, little is known about bacterial infection and intestinal stem cells. Our study aims at understanding bacterial regulation of the intestinal stem cell in a Salmonella colitis mouse model. We found that Salmonella activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway that is known to regulate stem cells. We identified Salmonella protein AvrA that modulates Wnt signaling including upregulating Wnt expression, modifying beta-catenin, increasing total beta-catenin expression, and activating Wnt/beta-catenin transcriptional activity in the intestinal epithelial cells. The numbers of stem cells and proliferative cells increased in the intestine infected with Salmonella expressing AvrA. Our study provides insights into bacterial infection and stem cell maintenance."
CD008892,0,9884830,0,Application of recombinant fimbrial protein for the specific detection of Salmonella enteritidis infection in poultry.,"A number of disease outbreaks of Salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis (SE) in humans have been traced to the consumption of SE-contaminated egg and egg products. A rapid, specific, and inexpensive method of detecting SE infection in poultry is necessary to reduce human outbreaks. We evaluated rSEF14 fimbrial antigen of SE for specific detection of SE-infected birds in latex agglutination test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. rSEF14 antigen was highly specific in identifying birds infected with SE. The sera from birds infected with closely related serogroup-D Salmonella and other avian pathogens did not react with rSEF14 antigen. The rSEF14 antigen identified antibodies in serum of 88% of birds during the first 2 weeks of infection, and 100% of the birds subsequently. The SE-specific antibodies were detected in egg yolk as early as 6 days post-infection in rSEF14-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results suggest that rSEF14-based assays could be used as screening tests for detection of SE antibodies and would overcome the cross reactions observed with existing serological tests."

Blood culture is currently the gold standard for diagnosis of typhoid fever, but it is time-consuming and takes several days for isolation and identification of causative organisms. It is then too late to initiate proper antibiotic therapy. Serological tests have very low sensitivity and specificity, and no practical value in endemic areas. As early diagnosis of the disease and prompt treatment are essential for optimal management, especially in children, a rapid sensitive detection method for typhoid fever is urgently needed. Although PCR is sensitive and rapid, initial research indicated similar sensitivity to blood culture and lower specificity. We developed a fast and highly sensitive blood culture PCR method for detection of Salmonella Typhi, allowing same-day initiation of treatment after accurate diagnosis of typhoid."

Adsorption of antisera with intact or sonicated smooth or rough salmonellae prior to immunoblotting showed that antibodies were directed against exposed, masked and intracellular antigens. Sera from H-2 congenic B10 mice which vary in their ability to clear salmonellae from the reticuloendothelial system (RES) showed a progressive increase in the intensity of the antibody response, which persisted longer in animals which failed to clear bacteria from the RES. The LPS response was much stronger in susceptible mice. Sera from 18 confirmed cases of human typhoid recognized similar antigens to mouse typhoid sera, with individual variations; there was no correlation between the immunoblot pattern and the titres of other serological tests for typhoid fever."

CD008892,0,18312473,0,Typhoid fever in children in Africa.,"Estimates for the year 2000 suggested that there were approximately 21.5 million infections and 200,000 deaths from typhoid fever globally each year, making the disease one of the most serious infectious disease threats to public health on a global scale. However, these estimates were based on little data, especially from Africa. Global prominence and high-profile outbreaks have created the perception in Kenya that typhoid is a common cause of febrile illness. The Widal test is used widely in diagnosis. We have reviewed recent literature, taking the perspective of a healthcare provider, to collate information on the prevalence of typhoid in children particularly, and to explore the role of clinical diagnosis and diagnosis based on a crude, but common, interpretation of the Widal test. Data suggest that typhoid in children in rural Africa is uncommon, perhaps 100 times or 250 times less common than invasive disease because of Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. Frequent use of the Widal test may result in many hundreds of over-treatment episodes for every true case treated and may perpetuate the perception that typhoid is common. Countries such as Kenya need better bacterial disease surveillance systems allied to better information for healthcare providers to promote appropriate decision-making on prevention and treatment strategies."
CD008892,0,10473232,0,Treatment of typhoid fever with azithromycin versus chloramphenicol in a randomized multicentre trial in India.,"To compare the clinical and bacteriological efficacies of azithromycin and chloramphenicol for treatment of typhoid fever, 77 bacteriologically evaluable adults, with blood cultures positive for Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi A susceptible to their assigned drugs, were entered into a randomized open trial at four hospitals in India. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive azithromycin 500 mg p.o. od for 7 days and 35 to receive chloramphenicol 2-3 g p.o. od in four divided doses for 14 days. Thirty-seven patients (88%) in the azithromycin group responded with clinical cure or improvement within 8 days and 30 patients (86%) in the chloramphenicol group responded with cure or improvement. By day 14 after the start of treatment, all patients treated with azithromycin and all except two of the patients treated with chloramphenicol (94%) were cured or improved. Blood cultures repeated on day 8 after start of therapy showed eradication of organisms in 100% of patients in the azithromycin group and 94% of patients in the chloramphenicol group. By day 14 the eradication rate in the chloramphenicol group had increased to 97%. Stool cultures on days 21 and 35 after start of treatment showed no prolonged faecal carriage of Salmonella spp. in either group. These results indicate that azithromycin given once daily for 7 days was effective therapy for typhoid fever in a region endemic with chloramphenicol-resistant S. typhi infection and was equivalent in effectiveness to chloramphenicol given to patients with chloramphenicol-susceptible infections."

In order to investigate the mechanism of action of this myeloprotector, murine long-term bone marrow cultures were treated with DDTC alone or were preceded by the anticancer drug cis-diammine(cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) (CBDCA), and the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating activity of the supernatants was measured. The supernatants harvested from DDTC-treated cultures enhanced proliferation of granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells almost 4-fold compared to cultures treated with no drug or with CBDCA alone. Pretreatment of cultures with CBDCA neither enhanced nor inhibited DDTC-induced colony-stimulating activity. Similar results were obtained by using marrow stromal cell cultures free of hematopoietic cells. Thus, DDTC may hasten bone marrow recovery by augmenting stromal cell production of a factor(s) with hematopoietic colony-stimulating activity."

At IFA cutoff titers of > or = 1.64 and > or = 1:128, the DS showed sensitivities of 88.2 and 91.4% and specificities of 91.8 and 87.7%, respectively. The DS test correlated significantly with both the IFA IgG (r = 0.84, P < 0.0005) and IgM (r = 0.63, P < 0.0005) titers. Only 80% of IgG and 82% of IgM IFA readings determined by two technicians were within one dilution, while the DS was more reliable, with 100% within one dot. The rapidity, reliability, and simplicity of the DS suggest that it is a suitable test for use in clinical laboratories unable to perform the IFA test."

The hLF produced in transgenic plant tissues migrated during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single band with an approximate molecular mass equal to hLF. Auxin activation of the mas P2 promoter increased lactoferrin expression levels in transformed tuber and leaf tissues to approximately 0.1% of total soluble plant protein. Antimicrobial activity against four different human pathogenic bacterial strains was detected in extracts of lactoferrin-containing potato tuber tissues. This is the first report of synthesis of full length, biologically active hLF in edible plants."
CD008892,0,8277794,0,Preliminary evaluation of the INDX DIP-S-TICKS with positive rickettsial samples in Malaysia.,"Forty-four serum samples of various reactivities to rickettsial antigens demonstrated by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique were tested with INDX Dip-S-Ticks (INDX Integrated Diagnostics Inc., USA) Kit for the detection of tick borne diseases. The kit utilised Rickettsia rickettsii the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) as antigens. The samples positive for endemic typhus were also tested against R. typhi, the agent for endemic typhus by the same method. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of cross-reactivity of R. rickettsii with rickettsial infections in Malaysia. Nine out of 12 tick typhus, 4 out of 10 scrub typhus and 4 out of 12 endemic typhus samples cross reacted with R. rickettsii. Ten out of 12 endemic samples were positive with R. typhi by the same method. From the study, we concluded that the INDX Dip-S-Ticks Kit can be used as a rapid screening test to detect endemic and tick-borne rickettsial infections in Malaysia but a second serological test is strongly recommended on all weakly reactive cases."

Nearly 87% children were in the age group of 3-10 years. Fever was present in all and splenomegaly in 90.2% cases. Urinary retention during the course of illness was present in 2 cases. The positivity rate of blood culture, bone marrow culture and Widal test was 83.7, 100 and 13.5%, respectively. Majority of the strains were of Phage 51-Type I. For the treatment of multidrug resistant cases gentamicin and furazolidine proved ineffective. Ciprofloxacin was tried in 85 cases and was found to be effective in all cases with no side effects."
CD008892,0,17615907,0,Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Salmonella enterica serotype typhi in eastern Nepal.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility patterns with special reference to multidrug resistance, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, and bacteriophage typing of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi isolated from blood sent for culture in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in eastern Nepal during January 2000-December 2004. In total, 132 strains of S. enterica Typhi, isolated from 2,568 blood culture samples collected from cases of suspected enteric fever, were tested for susceptibility to commonly-used antimicrobials by the disc-diffusion method. There were 35 multidrug-resistant strains. None of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Of 52 isolates tested for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, 36 (69.23%) showed reduced susceptibility (MIC >0.25 mg/L). Of 112 strains tested for nalidixic acid susceptibility, 86 (76%) were resistant. Strains with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and resistance to nalidixic acid could be correlated. The commonest phage type was El. Nalidixic acid susceptibility could be a useful screening test for the detection of decreased susceptibility of S. Typhi to ciprofloxacin, a drug which is commonly used even for minor ailments in this area."
CD008892,0,9009296,0,Safety of live oral Salmonella typhi vaccine strains with deletions in htrA and aroC aroD and immune response in humans.,"A single-dose, oral Salmonella typhi vaccine strain has been sought as a carrier or vector of cloned genes encoding protective antigens of other pathogens. Such a hybrid vaccine, administered orally, would stimulate immune responses both at the mucosal surface and in the systemic compartment and would potentially provide protection against multiple pathogens. S. typhi CVD 908 and CVD 906, which harbor deletions in aroC and aroD, were further engineered by deletion in htrA to produce strains CVD 908-htrA and CVD 906-htrA, which are unable to sustain growth and are severely impaired in their ability to survive in host tissues. These strains were fed to humans at doses of 5 x 10(7) to 5 x 10(9) CFU with buffer, and safety and immune responses were assessed. CVD 908-htrA and CVD 906-htrA were well tolerated in volunteers; mild diarrhea in 3 of 36 volunteers and mild fever in 1 volunteer were the only notable adverse responses. The vaccine strains were not detected in blood cultures and only transiently detected in stool. Serum immune responses to S. typhi lipopolysaccharide and H antigens were observed in 75 to 100% of volunteers who received 5 x 10(8) to 5 x 10(9) CFU, and cells secreting S. typhi-specific antibodies were found in all volunteers after ingestion of either strain. Sixty-three percent to 83% of volunteers developed lymphoproliferative responses to S. typhi flagellar and particulate antigens after the higher doses. These studies demonstrate the potential of CVD 908-htrA as a live vector for the delivery of heterologous genes, and a clinical trial of such a construct is planned."
CD008892,0,11117948,0,Evaluation of a serological Salmonella mix-ELISA for poultry used in a national surveillance programme.,"A Mix-ELISA using lipopolysaccharide antigens from Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis and Typhimurium was evaluated using samples collected over time in the Danish salmonella surveillance programme for poultry. Serological samples (n = 42,813) taken from broiler-breeder flocks after a year of bacteriological monitoring with negative results were used for calculating the flock and individual test specificities, which were 0.997 and 0.999, respectively. Layer flocks from the table egg sector were used for calculation of positive predictive values. In the survey, flocks were examined for salmonella by Mix-ELISA and by faecal culture, and in case of a positive result in either of these a repeated, serological testing was performed, and 60 animals were organ-cultured. If one of these samplings was positive, the flock was declared salmonella infected. In a period of 3 months, 35 flocks were found to be positive in the routine samples. Of these, 32 were serologically positive, 2 both serologically and faecally positive and 1 flock only faecally positive. For flocks serologically positive in the surveillance programme, a positive-predictive value of 0.62 for organ culture positivity was found, and while considering serological follow-up samples, the value was 0.95."
CD008892,0,10083793,0,Changing pattern of antibiotic sensitivity of Salmonella typhi.,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi led to the use of quinolones as the first-line drug in the treatment of adult patients with typhoid fever. However, over the last few years there has been an impression that patients on ciprofloxacin tended to take longer to defervesce. We studied the response and antibiotic sensitivity patterns during 2 time periods to assess the changes that may have occurred."
CD008892,0,12824689,0,R-Factor in Salmonella enterica serovar typhi: transfer to and acquisition from Escherichia coli.,"Blood culture isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi showing high degrees of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and tetracycline (ACCoT-resistance) transferred their full resistance phenotype to antibiotic-sensitive S. enterica serovar Typhi strains through the primary recipient Escherichia coli C600. Transfer frequencies were 0.80 x 10(-5) and 0.80 x 10(-6), respectively, in the primary and secondary transfer experiments. The Escherichia coli isolates from urinary tract infection cases showing high minimum inhibitory concentration values (microg/ml) to A (2,000-5,000), C (2,000-5,000), Co (250-1,200), and T (500-2,000) also transferred ACCoT-resistance to the antibiotic-sensitive S. enterica serovar Typhi and then to E. coli C600 with transfer frequencies 0.61 x 10(-6) and 0.98 x 10(-5), respectively. Curing experiments revealed the loss of ACCoT-resistance from the original and the transconjugant S. enterica serovar Typhi strains. Results suggest that R-factor from other enteric bacteria is acquired by S. enterica serovar Typhi, and that it (R-factor) is unstable in nature."
CD008892,0,26524875,0,[Usefulness of Immunochromatography Method for Malaria and Dengue Fever Diagnosis].,"There are three major differential diagnosis of febrile patients with history of travels to the tropical countries i.e., malaria, typhoid fever and dengue fever. Diagnosis of malaria patients undergoes sometimes arduous process due to the variable skills of laboratory technician, and more convenient method is warranted. Immunochromatography (IC) method is simple method and recently used for diagnosis of several infectious diseases. Here, we reported usefulness of IC method for malaria and dengue fever diagnosis. Forty-seven samples from 46 patients were retrospectively analyzed by both malaria IC method and microscopic examination. Furthermore, three patients were undergone dengue IC method followed by PCR and antibody examination (ELISA) if the results were positive. Several factors such as rheumatoid factor (RF) are known to affect the results of IC method. We also checked malaria and dengue IC method using serum known to be high RF results without malaria infection. Totally six patients were diagnosed as malaria i.e., 1 vivax malaria and 5 falciparum malaria. Sensitivity and specificity of the malaria IC method were excellent, 100% and 97.6%, respectively. Among three patients, one patient revealed false-negative results of dengue IC method, however, results of the other two patients revealed good correlation between IC method and PCR/ELISA results. Among four RF positive serums, 2 malaria IC method and 4 dengue IC method revealed false-positive results. In summary, IC method for malaria and dengue fever might be quick and convenient method and considered to be used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool."

CD008892,0,8406566,0,Specific and natural antibody production during Salmonella typhimurium infection in genetically susceptible and resistant mice.,"Genetically susceptible (C57BL/6) and resistant (CBA) mice were infected with an avirulent strain of Salmonella typhimurium and studied over a 35-day period for the production of antibodies directed against bacterial antigens including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (specific antibodies) and antibodies directed against self antigens [natural antibodies (NAb)]. Antibodies directed against LPS and self antigens were detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and those directed against other bacterial antigens by immunoblotting. We found that serum natural antibody titres in C57BL/6 and CBA mice were similar and correlated with the bacterial load in the spleen and liver. In C57BL/6 mice, anti-LPS antibodies remained polyreactive and of the IgM isotype. In contrast, CBA mice, after an early increase in polyreactive IgM anti-LPS antibodies, mounted a specific anti-LPS IgG antibody response. The immunoblotting results demonstrated that the IgM polyreactive antibodies in the resistant and susceptible mice recognized bacterial antigens of different molecular weights and that CBA, but not C57BL/6 mice, were able to produce IgG antibodies recognizing bacterial components. Our results suggest that the synthesis of antibodies directed against bacterial antigens and natural antibodies follow, at least partially, distinct pathways, but they do not allow us to determine whether these two antibody populations are produced by the same or distinct B-cell subpopulations."
CD008892,0,19741090,0,Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi-specific immunoglobulin A antibody responses in plasma and antibody in lymphocyte supernatant specimens in Bangladeshi patients with suspected typhoid fever.,"Many currently available diagnostic tests for typhoid fever lack sensitivity and/or specificity, especially in areas of the world where the disease is endemic. In order to identify a diagnostic test that better correlates with typhoid fever, we evaluated immune responses to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (serovar Typhi) in individuals with suspected typhoid fever in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We enrolled 112 individuals with suspected typhoid fever, cultured day 0 blood for serovar Typhi organisms, and performed Widal assays on days 0, 5, and 20. We harvested peripheral blood lymphocytes and analyzed antibody levels in supernatants collected on days 0, 5, and 20 (using an antibody-in-lymphocyte-supernatant [ALS] assay), as well as in plasma on these days. We measured ALS reactivity to a serovar Typhi membrane preparation (MP), a formalin-inactivated whole-cell preparation, and serovar Typhi lipopolysaccharide. We measured responses in healthy Bangladeshi, as well as in Bangladeshi febrile patients with confirmed dengue fever or leptospirosis. We categorized suspected typhoid fever individuals into different groups (groups I to V) based on blood culture results, Widal titer, and clinical features. Responses to MP antigen in the immunoglobulin A isotype were detectable at the time of presentation in the plasma of 81% of patients. The ALS assay, however, tested positive in all patients with documented or highly suspicious typhoid, suggesting that such a response could be the basis of improved diagnostic point-of-care-assay for serovar Typhi infection. It can be important for use in epidemiological studies, as well as in difficult cases involving fevers of unknown origin."
CD008892,0,21692675,0,The utility of diagnostic tests for enteric fever in endemic locations.,"Enteric fever, an infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and serovar Paratyphi A, is common and endemic in many areas of the Asian and African continents. In endemic areas, diagnostic tests are needed to diagnose acute cases for clinical management, to detect convalescent and chronic fecal carriage and for contact tracing. A suitable test may also allow an assessment of disease burden in a community to determine the need for vaccination programs. Each specific role may warrant a dedicated test, utilizing different samples, targets and methods to serve their respective purpose. Current diagnostic methods are poor. Blood culture is insufficiently sensitive and technically demanding, and bone marrow culture, although more sensitive, is infrequently performed. Antibody- and antigen-detection tests lend themselves to point-of-care format but remain insufficiently sensitive and specific for this role. There are concerns about the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification tests and they have not become widely adopted. However, new approaches using genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, in vivo-induced antigen and immunoaffinity proteomics-based technologies are being employed to identify new antigens, gene targets and metabolic products that could be used as a basis for more effective diagnostic tests. If novel tests are to be credible and widely used they require rigorous evaluation in endemic areas in studies with appropriate selection of patients, adequate sample sizes and proper attention to a gold standard reference. Here, we discuss the range of methods currently used for diagnosing enteric fever in endemic locations and we suggest new technologies which may improve enteric fever diagnostics over the coming years."
CD008892,0,1372317,0,Structural and immunochemical studies of the lipopolysaccharides of Salmonella strains with both antigen O4 and antigen O9.,"Two Salmonella hybrid strains, SL5313 (Salmonella typhimurium with a D.rfb+ gene cluster) and SL5396 (S. enteritidis with a B.rfb+ gene cluster), each expressing both O-antigen 4 (of serogroup B) and O-antigen 9 (of serogroup D) were studied by immunofluorescence using a mixture of O4-specific mouse monoclonal and O9-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Bound antibodies, detected by anti-mouse antibody labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-rabbit antibody labelled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate showed that more than 98% of the bacteria expressed both the O4 and O9 epitopes. Phenol-water-extracted lipopolysaccharide from batch-grown cultures subjected to sugar and methylation analyses by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were shown to contain abequose (of the O4 epitope) and tyvelose (of the O9 epitope) in ratios of 1:1.5 and 1:2.5 for SL5313 and SL5396, respectively. Isolated polysaccharide chains, obtained by weak-acid hydrolysis of the lipopolysaccharides, were found to contain both O4 and O9 specificities in the same molecule, since polysaccharide bound to O4 antibody attached to a solid-phase-adsorbed O9-specific antibody and vice versa. This demonstrates that in strains SL5313 and SL5396 O chains containing both O4 repeating units (from S. typhimurium) and O9 units (from S. enteritidis) are present."
CD008892,0,18786847,0,False-positive results of a rapid K39-based strip test and Chagas disease.,"The definitive diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) requires invasive procedures with demonstration of amastigotes in tissue or promastigotes in culture. Unfortunately, these approaches require laboratory materials not available in poor countries where the disease is endemic. The correct diagnosis of VL is important, and made more difficult by the fact that several common tropical diseases such as malaria, disseminated tuberculosis, and enteric fever share the same clinical presentation. Serological tests have been developed to replace parasitological diagnosis in the field. A commercially available K39-based strip test for VL has been developed for this purpose. The endemic area of leishmaniasis in Brazil overlaps the endemic area of Chagas disease, a disease that can cause false-positive serological test results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of false-positive exams using a rapid test for VL in patients with Chagas disease."

N-terminal amino acid sequencing yielded the Wzy translational startpoint. Next, the Wzy protein was C-terminally tagged with the FLAG peptide, and immunoblotting of an S. typhimurium strain expressing a low-copy wzy-FLAG gene (five copies per cell) localized the intact Wzy protein in the cytoplasmic membrane of S. typhimurium cells.

Standard syndromic treatment based on data from the pre-HIV era is for iron deficiency, worms and malaria. We prospectively investigated 105 adults admitted consecutively to medical wards with haemoglobin < 7 g/dl. Those with acute blood loss were excluded. Patients were investigated for possible parasitic, bacterial, mycobacterial and nutritional causes of anaemia, including bone marrow aspiration, to identify potentially treatable causes. Seventy-nine per cent of patients were HIV-positive. One-third of patients had tuberculosis, which was diagnosed only by bone marrow culture in 8% of HIV-positive patients. In 21% of individuals bacteria were cultured, with non-typhi salmonella predominating and Streptococcus pneumoniae rare. Iron deficiency, hookworm infection and malaria were not common in HIV-positive anaemic adults, although heavy hookworm infections were found in 6 (27%) of the 22 HIV-negative anaemic adults. In conclusion, conventional treatment for severe anaemia in adults is not appropriate in an area of high HIV prevalence.

Urine from smokers was found to be mutagenic (14.4-30.9 revertants/ml equivalent) while a control set of urine from non-smokers was not. Data from the storage study when analyzed by analysis of variance techniques indicated no statistical loss of mutagens occurred over the 175-day period although near significance was observed (P = 0.054). This near significance was the result of decreasing mutant response as storage time increased for two of the higher doses tested."
CD008892,0,8488354,0,[Acute diarrhea--current assessment and therapy in clinical practice].,"Acute diarrhea is most commonly caused by infectious agents. The first step in the evaluation is based on the medical history, clinical presentation and simple stool examinations (fecal leukocytes and occult blood). Thereby it can be decided, whether a microbial identification or an antibiotic therapy are indicated. In case of viral or noninvasive, enterotoxinogenic diarrhea oral rehydration is sufficient, whereas enteroinvasive diarrhea or enteric syndromes need further evaluation by stool and blood cultures. Depending on the clinical situation and the result of cultures, an appropriate or empiric therapy with antibiotics is indicated in acute febrile dysentery, shigellosis, cholera, typhoid fever, severe salmonellosis and Cl. difficile colitis."
CD008892,0,3998508,0,Diarrhea associated with typhoid fever.,"To study the pathogenesis of diarrhea occurring with typhoid fever, we selected 42 patients with diarrhea and blood cultures positive for Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi A, but without diarrheal copathogens, for measurement of stool output and examination of fecal composition. The mean duration of fever before hospitalization was 9.5 days, and the mean duration of diarrhea was 5.8 days. All patients passed liquid stool on their first day in the hospital, ranging in volume from 4 to 172 ml/kg with a mean of 45 ml/kg. Red blood cells were in the stools of 57% of the patients. All patients had fecal leukocytes with a mean of 4,950 leukocytes/mm3, predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In the stools, the mean protein concentration was 9.3 g/liter; the mean pH was 6.1, and the mean concentration of electrolytes was as follows: sodium, 47 mEq/liter; potassium, 48 mEq/liter; and chloride, 43 mEq/liter. The mean total CO2 was 24 mmol/liter. During treatment with chloramphenicol, this group of patients showed daily improvement with a drop in both fever and stool output. The results indicate that patients with diarrhea during typhoid fever have a wide range of rates of purging, and the diarrhea is characterized by liquid stool containing large quantities of leukocytes and protein and is resolved by treatment with chloramphenicol."

Two-thirds of patients belonged to the 15 to 35 years age group. The most common predisposing cardiac lesion was rheumatic heart disease seen in 73.4 percent patients. Mitral valve prolapse and right-sided endocarditis were infrequent, seen in four patients each. Blood culture positivity was 28.7 percent in adults and 61 percent in children. Commonest organism isolated was staphylococcus aureus in adults (39.3%) and streptococcus viridans in children (48%). Salmonella typhi was detected in 17 patients and showed excellent response to ciprofloxacin and gentamycin. Overall mortality was 13.9 percent and resistant heart failure was the leading cause of death. Our study presents the clinical spectrum of infective endocarditis and highlights the comparison with western studies."

CD008892,0,9831648,0,"Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic enzyme heptosyltransferase I gene (waaC) from Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli.","Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are common causes of gastrointestinal disease and a proportion of C. jejuni infections have been shown to be associated with the Guillain-Barré syndrome. The waaC gene from Campylobacter coli, involved in lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis, was cloned by complementation of a heptose-deficient strain of Salmonella typhimurium, as judged by novobiocin sensitivity, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific phage sensitivity, and polyacrylamide-resolved lipopolysaccharide profiles. The C. jejuni waaC gene was subsequently cloned using the waaC gene isolated from C. coli as a probe. The C. jejuni and C. coli waaC genes are capable of encoding proteins of 342 amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 39381Da and 39317Da, respectively. Sequence and in-vitro analyses suggested that the C. coli waaC gene may be transcribed from its own promoter. Translation of the C. coli waaC gene in a cell-free system yielded a protein with a Mr of 39000. The waaC gene was detected in every C. jejuni and C. coli isolate tested as judged by dot-blot hybridization analysis. Southern hybridization analysis indicated that both Campylobacter species contain a single copy of the waaC gene. Unlike Escherichia coli and S. typhimurium isolates, the waaC gene in C. jejuni and C. coli isolates does not appear to be linked to the waaF (rfaF) gene."
CD008892,0,17178790,0,Role of RpoS in fine-tuning the synthesis of Vi capsular polysaccharide in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi.,"Regulation of the synthesis of Vi polysaccharide, a major virulence determinant in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, is under the control of two regulatory systems, ompR-envZ and rscB-rscC, which respond to changes in osmolarity. Some serotype Typhi strains exhibit overexpression of Vi polysaccharide, which masks clinical detection of lipopolysaccharide O antigen. This variation in Vi polysaccharide and O antigen display (VW variation) has been observed since the initial studies of serotype Typhi. In this study, we report that rpoS plays a role in this increased expression in Vi polysaccharide. We constructed a variety of isogenic serotype Typhi mutants that differed in their expression levels of RpoS and examined the role of the rpoS product in synthesis of Vi polysaccharide under different osmolarity conditions. Vi polysaccharide synthesis was also examined in serotype Typhi mutants in which the native promoter of the rpoS was replaced by an araCP(BAD) cassette, so that the expression of rpoS was arabinose dependent. The RpoS(-) strains showed increased syntheses of Vi polysaccharide, which at low and medium osmolarities masked O antigen detection. In contrast, RpoS(+) strains showed lower syntheses of Vi polysaccharide, and an increased detection of O antigen was observed. During exponential growth, when rpoS is unstable or present at low levels, serotype Typhi RpoS(+) strains overexpress the Vi polysaccharide at levels comparable to those for RpoS(-) strains. Our results show that RpoS is another regulator of Vi polysaccharide synthesis and contributes to VW variation in serotype Typhi, which has implications for the development of recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccines in humans."
CD008892,0,24055826,0,BaeR protein from Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A induces inflammatory response in murine and human cell lines.,"BaeR is the response regulator of the two-component system, BaeSR, found in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella. Several biological functions of BaeR, related to multidrug efflux and bacterial virulence, have been described. Herein, we report a putative function of BaeR during inflammatory response of the host by using BaeR protein of Salmonella enterica Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A) origin overexpressed in E. coli, and RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells as in vitro models. BaeR (3 μg/ml) upregulated iNOS mRNA expression in both cell lines, and induced significant production of NO. Greater than ten-fold (TNF-α), 24-fold (IL-1β) and 156-fold (IL-6) increases in mRNA expression levels were observed in THP-1 cells treated with BaeR, compared to untreated controls. Furthermore, an eight-fold (IL-1β), 12-fold (IL-6) and 41-fold (TNF-α) higher protein concentrations were observed in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with BaeR, compared to control cells. Immunoblot analysis showed BaeR-induced phosphorylation of the MAPKs (ERK 1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK) in RAW 264.7 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of the three MAPKs using specific inhibitors resulted in significant reduction of BaeR-induced NO production and iNOS mRNA expression by inhibitors of JNK and p38 MAPK. Also, all inhibitors of the MAPKs significantly attenuated BaeR-induced IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α at both transcript and protein levels with different degrees of inhibition. Taken together, our data suggest that BaeR is a putative inducer of inflammatory response and the MAPKs are involved in the process."
CD008892,0,21752606,0,Outbreak of a novel Enterobacter sp. carrying blaCTX-M-15 in a neonatal unit of a tertiary care hospital in Tanzania.,"Enterobacter hormaechei and Cronobacter sakazakii are amongst the most important causes of outbreaks of neonatal sepsis associated with powdered milk. In this study, we report for the first time an outbreak of a novel Enterobacter sp. harbouring bla(CTX-M-15) in a neonatal unit in Tanzania. Seventeen Gram-negative enteric isolates from neonatal blood cultures were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by disc diffusion testing, and the presence of the bla(CTX-M-15) gene was established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Identification by biochemical profiling was followed by nucleotide sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), rpoB and hsp60 alleles. Environmental sampling was done and control measures were established. Isolates were initially misidentified based on their fermentation characteristics and agglutination as Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems, and were found to harbour bla(CTX-M-15) on a 291-kb narrow-range plasmid. PFGE analysis indicated the clonal outbreak of a single strain, infecting 17 neonates with a case fatality rate of 35%. The same strain was isolated from a milk bucket. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA, rpoB and hsp60 sequences permitted no definitive identification, clustering the strains in the Enterobacter cloacae complex with similarities of 92-98.8%. The data describe an outbreak of a novel bla(CTX-M-15)-positive, multiresistant Enterobacter strain in an African neonatal unit that can easily be misidentified taxonomically. These data highlight the need for constant surveillance of bacteria harbouring extended-spectrum β-lactamases as well as improvements in hygiene measures in developing countries."
CD008892,0,9398514,0,Structure-function correlations in the XerD site-specific recombinase revealed by pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis.,"Xer-mediated site-specific recombination contributes to the stability of circular chromosomes in bacteria by resolving plasmid multimers and chromosome dimers to monomers prior to cell division. Two related site-specific recombinases, XerC and XerD, each catalyse one pair of strand exchange during Xer recombination. In order to relate the recently determined structure of XerD to its function, the XerD protein was subjected to pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis, which leads to a variable five amino acid cassette being introduced randomly into the target protein. This has allowed identification of regions of XerD involved in specific DNA binding, in communicating with the partner recombinase, XerC, and in catalysis and its control. The C-terminal domain of XerD, comprising two-thirds of the protein, contains the catalytic active site and comprises ten alpha helices (alphaE to alphaN) and a beta hairpin. A flexible linker connects this domain to the N-terminal domain that comprises four alpha helices (alphaA to alphaD). Pentapeptide insertions into alphaB, alphaD, alphaG, or alphaJ interfered with DNA binding. Helices alphaG and alphaJ comprise a pseudo helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif that may provide specificity of recombinase binding. An insertion in alphaL, adjacent to an active site arginine residue, led to loss of cooperative interactions between XerC and XerD and abolished recombination activity. Other insertions close to active site residues also abolished recombination activity. Proteins with an insertion in the beta hairpin turn bound DNA, interacted cooperatively with XerC and had a phenotype that is consistent with the protein being defective in XerD catalysis. This beta hairpin appears to be highly conserved in related proteins. Insertions at a number of dispersed locations did not impair XerD catalytic activity or DNA binding, but failed to allow XerC catalysis in vivo, indicating that several sites of interaction between XerD and XerC may be important for activation of XerC catalysis by XerD."

Positive blood culture isolates were obtained in 26.9% of 1,982 children. The most prevalent isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (59.9%), Escherichia coli (16.9%) and Klebsiella (16.3%). There was a striking paucity of isolation of Salmonella typhi (1.3%) and Streptococcus. Sensitivity to commonly used drugs like ampicillin/cloxacillin, genticin, ceftazidime and chloramphenicol was low (8.0-50.0%), with a corresponding delayed fever resolution and prolonged hospital stay. 31.0-83.3% of the isolates were highly sensitive to pefloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin, which were not generally recommended for use in paediatric patients. In two patients with no response to commonly used antibiotics, use of quinolones lysed their fever within 48 hours. This change of antibiotic sensitivity patterns calls for a thorough investigation into the potential role of these quinolones in paediatric chemotherapeutics either singly or in appropriate combinations with existing antibiotics."

This study describes the clinical spectrum, management and outcome of all confirmed cases of extraintestinal salmonellosis in patients admitted to University Hospital, Nottingham, UK, between 1980 and 1997. There were 142 cases (children, 42; adults, 100) of extraintestinal salmonellosis, of which 38 (children, 20; adults, 18) were enteric fever, consisting of 21 cases of typhoid, 12 of paratyphoid A and five of paratyphoid B. All patients with typhoid and paratyphoid A fever were from Indian or Pakistani families and, except for two adults, all were considered to be previously fit. The outcome in patients with enteric fever was excellent, and there were no complications. Of the 104 patients (children, 22; adults, 82) with nontyphoidal salmonellosis, 69 were bacteraemic secondary to gastroenteritis, 10 were bacteraemic without an obvious focus of infection and 25 had focal infections. The three major sites of focal infections were meningitis in five infants, osteomyelitis in two children and three adults, and arterial infections in ten adults. The three most frequently isolated organisms were Salmonella enteritidis (40%), Salmonella typhimurium (25%) and Salmonella virchow (14%). Sixty-seven percent of these patients had underlying disease(s)/risk factors. In contrast to the outcome of enteric fever, there were 19 deaths (children, 2; adults, 17) in patients with nontyphoidal salmonellosis. Sixteen of the 17 adults who died were over the age of 60 years. Eight (25%) of 32 males over the age of 60 years with nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteraemia had arterial infections. In some patients, the diagnosis of Salmonella arterial infection is likely to be delayed or missed altogether if blood cultures are not obtained. Mortality in patients over the age of 60 years with nontyphoidal Salmonella infections was 28%."
CD008892,0,15181493,0,Changing characteristics of typhoid fever in Taiwan.,"Typhoid fever, a systemic disease caused by Salmonella typhi, is classically characterized by fever and abdominal symptoms. Although now considered uncommon, it seems to have re-emerged in Taiwan in recent years. We conducted a retrospective study of the clinical characteristics and microbiologic findings in 24 confirmed cases of typhoid fever treated over a 7-year period at a medical center in northern Taiwan. There were 11 males and 13 females, including 15 adults (over 18 years in age) and 9 children. Their mean age was 24.7 years (range, 9 months to 58 years). Twelve patients had recently returned from abroad, mostly from Southeast Asia. The most common complaints were fever (24/24), diarrhea (18/24), abdominal pain (10/24), and cough (10/24). The average duration of fever before diagnosis was 14.1 days, with a maximum of 30 days. Relative bradycardia was noted in 6 patients. Leukopenia was noted in 2 patients. S. typhi was isolated from blood culture in 20 cases, from stool culture in 3 cases, and from bone marrow culture in 1 case. Widal test was only positive initially in 7/18 cases. Fever of unknown origin was the most common initial diagnosis. Typhoid or enteric fever was impressed initially in only 2 cases. Almost all isolates of S. typhi were susceptible to antibiotics currently used for typhoid fever, with only 1 isolate resistant to chloramphenicol. All patients survived after antibiotic treatment. Only 1 patient developed recurrence after a 10-day course of ceftriaxone. In conclusion, the diagnosis of typhoid fever is often challenging due to non-specific symptoms and lack of an immediate confirmatory test. It is important to include this disease in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients with abdominal symptoms."

The objectives were to compare the positivity of blood culture using 3 ml versus 10 ml of blood and to examine in how far specific antibiotic treatment for TF interfered with the positivity of BM culture. Blood for culture was collected before antibiotic treatment was initiated in hospital and BM 1 to 10 days after the start of treatment. Cultures were performed with Oxgall subcultured on SS agar. Seventy-nine per cent of patients was treated for 14 days or more with oral chloramphenicol, 18% with chloramphenicol followed by ampicillin or cotrimoxazol and 3% with other antibiotics. Cultures were positive for Salmonella typhi or S-paratyphi A in 57 of the 145 patients (39.3%) when 3 ml of blood was cultured and in 58 (40%) when 10 ml of blood was cultured. BM culture was positive despite antibiotic treatment in 70 patients (48.2%); this positivity was significantly greater than that of blood cultures (p < 0.05). When we considered the positivity of BM culture in relation to the number of days on antibiotics in hospital, the yield of BM culture remained apparently unchanged during the first 5 days of treatment. This may be the consequence of slow elimination of S.typhi or S.paratyphi by the antibiotics used and could be responsible for relapses."

We evaluated these tests in a community clinic in Bangladesh. Blood samples were obtained from 867 febrile patients for culture, Typhidot and Tubex tests. Considering the 43 blood culture-confirmed cases of typhoid fever as typhoid positive and the 24 other confirmed bacteremia cases as typhoid negative, Tubex was 60% sensitive and 58% specific, with 90% positive and 58% negative predictive values (NPVs); Typhidot was 67% sensitive and 54% specific, with 85% positive and 81% NPVs. When blood culture-negative patients and other bacteremia cases together were considered typhoid negative, positive predictive values were only 14% for Tubex and 13% for Typhidot, increasing to only 38% and 20% when restricted to patients with > or = 7 days of fever.

We searched four databases and identified studies of south and southeast Asia published between 1990 and 2010 that prospectively assessed patients admitted to hospital and from whom a blood culture was taken. We reviewed 17 eligible studies describing 40,644 patients. Pathogenic organisms were isolated from 3506 patients (9%; range 1-51%); 1784 (12%) of 14,386 adults and 1722 (7%) of 26,258 children. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi was the most common bacterial pathogen, accounting for 532 of 1798 (30%) isolates in adults and 432 of 1723 (25%) in children. Other commonly isolated organisms in adults were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms, and in children were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.

CD008892,0,24858647,0,Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.,"Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique."

Additional 44 sera stemming from patients without such infection were included in the investigation as a control. With ELISA the sera were examined for antibodies of the IgM- and IgG-class separately. As antigens lipopolysaccharide W-preparations from S. typhi (""group D-antigen"") and S. typhimurium (""group B-antigen"") were used in the ELISA. High reciprocal titers (geometric means: 1404, 2560, and 1020) of IgM were demonstrable in sera drawn 11-30 days after onset of the disease with group D- and group B-antigen respectively (Fig. 1, Table 1 and Table 2). With increasing distance of time from the onset of the disease these titers decreased rapidly. The titers of agglutinating antibodies as measured in the Widal-test behaved similarly to those of IgM (Fig. 1, Table 1 and 2), and the correlation between both was high (r = +0.93, Fig. 2). In contrast, titers of IgG-antibodies reached their maximum later, namely 31-60 days after onset of the disease (Table 1), and the correlation to the agglutinin-titers (r = +0.33, Fig. 3) was much lower. In sera of patients with typhoid fever reciprocal titers of IgM against the homogeneous group antigen surmounted those of IgG at the average by about 5 log2-step (mean g: 1404 and 79 respectively) between the 11th and 30th day of disease. At this stage of the disease also sera from patients with gastroenteritis due to both salmonella D or B demonstrated clearly an IgM-dominated ratio. After a period of more than 2 month this ratio was about 1:1 in sera of patients with typhoid fever or with salmonella group D-gastroenteritis, but was clearly IgG-dominated in sera obtained from patients with group B-gastroenteritis.

CD008892,0,3074465,0,Norfloxacin in the treatment of infections caused by Salmonella typhi.,"The bacteriological and clinical efficacy of norfloxacin 400 mg b.i.d. was studied in an open, non-comparative trial. Twenty-seven patients with clinical symptoms of typhoid fever were included and assigned to treatment for 14 days. Salmonella typhi was found in stools and/or blood cultures from 12 patients. Subsequent cultures from ten of these patients were negative during treatment and in the follow-up period. Two patients remained positive in stool cultures. Body temperature normalized within one week in 11 of the 12 evaluable patients. In conclusion, these results indicate the potential clinical value of norfloxacin for treatment of typhoid fever. Further controlled and comparative studies are needed."

CD008892,0,15611102,0,Dissemination of lipid A deacylases (pagL) among gram-negative bacteria: identification of active-site histidine and serine residues.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the main constituents of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane. It usually consists of a highly variable O-antigen, a less variable core oligosaccharide, and a highly conserved lipid moiety, designated lipid A. Several bacteria are capable of modifying their lipid A architecture in response to external stimuli. The outer membrane-localized lipid A 3-O-deacylase, encoded by the pagL gene of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, removes the fatty acyl chain from the 3 position of lipid A. Although a similar activity was reported in some other Gram-negative bacteria, the corresponding genes could not be identified. Here, we describe the presence of pagL homologs in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. Although the overall sequence similarity is rather low, a conserved domain could be distinguished in the C-terminal region. The activity of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bordetella bronchiseptica pagL homologs was confirmed upon expression in Escherichia coli, which resulted in the removal of an R-3-hydroxymyristoyl group from lipid A. Upon deacylation by PagL, E. coli lipid A underwent another modification, which was the result of the activity of the endogenous palmitoyl transferase PagP. Furthermore, we identified a conserved histidine-serine couple as active site residues, suggesting a catalytic mechanism similar to serine hydrolases. The biological function of PagL remains unclear. However, because PagL homologs were found in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic species, PagL-mediated deacylation of lipid A probably does not have a dedicated role in pathogenicity."

The his- derivative, SL1367 (still calf-virulent), was then given by transduction and mutation, a transposon-generated non-reverting aromatic biosynthesis (aro) defect; this defect caused loss of virulence for the mouse. The his- aro- derivative strain, SL1438, was effective as a live vaccine in mice. Twenty male Holstein calves were divided into 4 groups. Groups I, II, and III were vaccinated IM at 2 weeks and at 3 weeks of age with aromatic-dependent (aro-) S dublin strain SL1438. Groups I and III received freshly prepared vaccine and group II received lyophilized vaccine. Serious adverse reactions to the vaccination were not seen. After vaccination, the mean maximum increase in rectal temperature was 1.8 C in group I and III calves and 0.6 C in group II calves. Fewer group II calves developed diarrhea (1 of 5) or positive blood cultures (0 of 5) after vaccination compared with group I and III calves (6 of 10 and 5 of 10, respectively). Postvaccination diarrhea was mild and of short duration. Group IV was comprised of 5 nonvaccinated calves. At 5 weeks of age, all calves were challenge exposed orally. Group I, II, and IV calves were challenge exposed with 10(11) virulent S dublin SL1367. Group III was challenge exposed with 10(11) virulent S typhimurium UCD 108-11. Subsequently, fever and diarrhea (lasting 1 to 3 days), but no deaths, were observed in the vaccinated calves. Four of the 5 nonvaccinated (group IV) calves died (P less than 0.001) within 8 days after challenge exposure. Aro- S dublin SL 1438 did not cause serious adverse effects and provided protection against oral challenge exposure with either virulent S dublin or S typhimurium."

CD008892,0,18927411,0,Modification of the TUBEX typhoid test to detect antibodies directly from haemolytic serum and whole blood.,"The TUBEX test for typhoid fever detects serum antibodies in a simple and rapid assay system based on the inhibition of binding between two types of reagent particles - magnetic particles coated with an antigen (Salmonella O9 LPS) and coloured indicator particles coated with an anti-O9 mAb. A magnet is used to separate the colour indicator particles bound to the magnetic particles from the unbound indicator particles. Specific colour changes following magnetic separation are indicative of antibodies in the patient's serum; however, because results are interpreted based on changes in the colour red, haemolytic or icteric specimens cannot be used. This study describes a simple modification of the protocol to accommodate such specimens, including whole blood. This involves the addition of a quick and simple washing step after mixing the specimen with the antigen-bound magnetic particles. This modification has the advantage of allowing larger sample volumes to be used, thus enhancing the assay sensitivity, and also enables cases considered to be borderline positive by the original method to be re-assessed."

These parameters were maximum on days 1-3, but returned to normal by the 8th-15th day after immunization. As differentiated from intact animals, the expression of genes for proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β (day 1 after immunization), IL-6 (days 1-3), TNF-α (days 1, 3, and 6), and IFN-α (days 1-3) was detected in bone marrow cultures from immunized mice. The expression of genes for IFN-γ, IL-18, and IFN-α was decreased on days 1, 3, and 6 after immunization of animals, respectively. Gene expression for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 was observed on day 6 after immunization. Therefore, this system was not characterized by a decrease in the immune response of stromal cells. The stromal component of hemopoietic and lymphoid organs has the vector of influences in response to bacterial antigens. This vector is directed to the stimulation and progression, but not to the suppression of immune reactions.

Analysis of data gaps pertaining to Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi infections in low and medium human development index countries, 1984-2005.","There are only 10 contemporary, population-based studies of typhoid fever that evaluate disease incidence using blood culture for confirmation of cases. Reported incidence ranged from 13 to 976/100 000 persons per year. These studies are likely to have been done preferentially in high- incidence sites which makes generalization of data difficult. Only five of these studies reported mortality. Of these the median (range) mortality was 0% (0-1.8%). Since study conditions usually involved enhanced clinical management of patients and the studies were not designed to evaluate mortality as an outcome, their usefulness for generalizing case-fatality rates is uncertain. No contemporary population-based studies reported rates of complications. Hospital-based typhoid fever studies reported median (range) complication rates of 2.8% (0.6-4.9%) for intestinal perforation and case-fatality rates of 2.0% (0-14.8%). Rates of complications other than intestinal perforation were not reported in contemporary hospital-based studies. Hospital-based studies capture information on the most severe illnesses among persons who have access to health-care services limiting their generalizability. Only two studies have informed the current understanding of typhoid fever age distribution curves. Extrapolation from population-based studies suggests that most typhoid fever occurs among young children in Asia. To reduce gaps in the current understanding of typhoid fever incidence, complications, and case-fatality rate, large population-based studies using blood culture confirmation of cases are needed in representative sites, especially in low and medium human development index countries outside Asia."

Quinolones and ceftriaxone allow treatments shorter than 10 days. Immunization (Typhim Vi) and improvement of hygienic standards are the cornerstone of prevention."

Since P450 3A5 has been reported to be present at significant levels in liver microsomes in approximately 25% of human adults, we examined and compared the role of P450 3A4 and 3A5 in procarcinogen activation in humans. Immunoblot experiments with liver microsomes from 60 human samples suggested that 4/30 Japanese and 4/30 Caucasians contained considerable levels of P450 3A5, although P450 3A4 could be determined at relatively high levels in all of the human samples examined. Good correlation was observed between P450 3A4, but not P450 3A5, levels versus activation of aflatoxin B1 and stergmatocystin in these human samples. Comparisons of the activation of procarcinogens in reconstituted monooxygenase systems containing modified P450 3A4 and 3A5 enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli were carried out in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 or NM2009 tester strain for genotoxicity assay, and it was found that P450 3A4 had similar activities to or higher rates than P450 3A5 for the 24 procarcinogens tested."

The electrophoretic mobility of the main protein components in the isolated preparation of LAP coincides with that of endotoxin components. The dissociation of proteins and lipopolysaccharide in the process of boiling the endotoxin in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate is indicative of the noncovalent binding of these components. LAP contained in the endotoxin, in contrast to isolated LAP, is resistant to trypsin and proteinase K. The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system with the use of LAP as a component of its solid phase has been developed, which makes it possible to carry out the quantitative determination of antibodies to this protein. The EIA system shows high sensitivity in the determination of anti-LAP IgG antibodies: in hyperimmune rabbit sera their titer is 1:250,000-1:800,000. As shown by the method of competitive EIA, the antigenic affinity of LAP of different origin corresponds to the degree of taxonomic propinquity of microorganisms: the maximal degree of cross reactions is observed between LAP obtained from S. sonnei, S. flexneri and Escherichia coli, while their affinity to Salmonella typhi is considerably less; remote microbial species (Bacterium bifidum and Sarcina marcescens) give practically no cross reactions."

The subjects included in the present study were patients with paratyphoid A who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College (Wenzhou, ZJ, China) between 1998 and 2009. The disease mainly occurred in persons aged 20 to 50 years. The peak incidence was between 2001 and 2003 (n = 85). Paratyphoid A was more likely to occur in winter and spring in this area. In many cases (33.8%), the condition was complicated by underlying diseases. The length of hospital stay was relatively long, averaging 17.68 days. The white blood cell (WBC) count was 2-8 × 10(9)/L in 88.5% of cases. Eosinophils disappeared in 51.7% of cases. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was not significant and lower than 60 mm/h in 88.5% of cases. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was ≤3-fold greater than the normal value in 84.3% of cases. The Widal test was positive in only 7.7% of our cases. The sensitivity of many antibiotics was over 90%. Paratyphoid A in the Wenzhou area has unique epidemic rules, clinical characteristics, and drug resistance. The results of our retrospective analysis are instructive for the early diagnosis and rational treatment of paratyphoid A."

CD008892,0,9055495,0,100 years of Widal test & its reappraisal in an endemic area.,A reappraisal of the Widal test was made for its diagnostic utility in typhoid fever in an endemic area of Central India. The significant basal antibody level in the normal population based on 1200 voluntary/relative blood donors at the cut-off titre of 80 or above was observed in 13.83 and 8.0 per cent for 'O' and 'H' antigens of Salmonella typhi respectively. A retrospective study (1991-1995) over 138 bacteriologically proven cases of typhoid showed a positivity of 64.49 and 78.26 per cent respectively for 'O' and 'H' antibodies at the titre of 80 or above and 44.2 and 63.04 per cent at the titre of 160 and above. The retrospective data also showed a greater positivity (46.41%) in 1991 which decreased to 25 per cent in 1995 and appeared to follow the incidence of multi drug resistant S. typhi over the period. The detection of 'H' antibodies is no less important than the 'O' antibodies in the present study. Our data bring out the diagnostic limitations of Widal test done on single samples collected in the early phase of illness (4-10 days) from patients suspected to have typhoid in an endemic area of Central India.

A total of 750 blood-culture-proven cases of enteric fever were studied. The majority of cases occurred in children aged 5-12 years and 24.8% of cases were in children up to 5 years of age. Salmonella serotypes showed an age-related predilection, with paratyphoid fever more common in adults. Classically-described clinical features of the disease were comparable among patients under and above 5 years of age. Hepatomegaly, anaemia and complications in general were more frequent in children up to 5 years of age. The antimicrobial resistance pattern, irrespective of Salmonella serotype, did not reveal a statistically significant difference across age groups for the different antibiotics tested. Multidrug resistance was seen only in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi but not in S. Paratyphi A isolates. However, resistance to nalidixic acid was comparable in both serotypes. Age-related differences of serotype isolation rates, clinical presentation and associated complications are noteworthy for better case management and policy planning. More epidemiological studies regarding reasons for age-related differential serotype patterns would enable and guide public health strategies to contain enteric fever in endemic locations."

This test (TUBEX-PA) is based on that (TUBEX-TF) used for typhoid fever, which detects anti-O9 antibodies. TUBEX-PA showed a sensitivity of 81.0% (47/58 culture-confirmed patients) to 93.3% (14/15) and was 98.1% (52/53) specific for healthy subjects. However, TUBEX-PA also detected 50% (7/14) to 81.8% (9/11) of typhoid patients, and conversely, TUBEX-TF detected 46.7% (7/15) to 73.3% (11/15) of paratyphoid A cases. This cross-detection could be abrogated in both tests by adding a blocker (heterologous antigen) to remove the antibodies responsible, which presumably bind to a common antigen (O12) located close to O2 and O9. The presence of anti-O12 antibodies in typhoid (9/12 or 75.0% sensitive) and paratyphoid A (22/33 or 66.7%) patients was demonstrated directly using a prototypic TUBEX test designed specifically to detect these antibodies. Thus, using TUBEX-PA and TUBEX-TF together can increase the diagnostic accuracy of detecting both typhoid and paratyphoid A fever, while the further use of differential tests allows possible immediate discrimination between these diseases."

The fish Sanma hiraki was treated with sodium chloride and sodium nitrite at pH 3. Previously, it had been found that an extract of the treated fish was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535 without S9 and also that it induced glandular stomach cancer upon gavage to rats. We now demonstrate that the mutagenicity was enhanced by preincubation of the raw meat for several days before salt-nitrite treatment. HPLC techniques showed that three mutagens were present in the fish extract. One of the mutagens was found to be stable over the pH range of 1.0-9.0. This mutagen was purified by silica gel solid phase extraction, followed by a series of reverse phase HPLC steps, and was characterized by low and high resolution MS, NMR, and FT-IR. While N-nitroso compounds were generally believed to be associated with gastric carcinogenesis, it was unexpectedly found that the mutagen has the novel structure 2-chloro-4-methylthiobutanoic acid (CMBA). Based on the structure, it seemed likely that methionine might be the precursor, and this was, indeed, proven. Both salt and nitrite are essential factors for forming this mutagen. The yield of CMBA was linear for chloride concentrations from 0 to 800 mM NaCl. Of 20 amino acids reacted with nitrite and chloride at pH 3, only methionine generated a mutagen for S. typhimurium TA 1535. Tryptophan gave a product mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA 100 and TA 98, but not TA 1535, and in the case of tyrosine, the mutagen was active only for TA 100. These results suggest an important role for salt in gastric carcinogenesis and provide new approaches for exploring the formation of mutagens/carcinogens for specific target organs."

In two cases, a ruptured aneurysm was demonstrated radiographically. In the remaining case, sonograms were diagnostic. The organisms responsible were salmonella, Hemophilus influenzae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In two cases, the infectious origin was evidenced by bacteriologic examination of the aortic wall, which revealed the presence of Salmonella enteritidis and Koch's bacillus. Although Hemophilus influenzae was not found in the aortic wall of the remaining case, the infectious origin of the aneurysm was established because preoperative blood cultures were positive for this pathogen, and pathohistologic examination of the specimen showed destruction associated with leukocyte infiltration of the aneurysmal wall. An in situ prosthetic graft replacement protected by omentum was performed in all three cases. Antibiotic therapy was continued for several weeks. All patients are well with follow-up ranging from 10 to 21 months. Infectious aneurysm associated with human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity results in bacterial infestation of an atheromatous aorta.

CD008892,0,3306260,0,Extra-intestinal manifestations of salmonella infections.,"While salmonellosis is often considered to affect primarily the gastrointestinal tract, infection at other sites may occur, producing characteristic clinical syndromes. We reviewed cases from our institutions and the literature on focal manifestations of salmonella infections. In the past, most extra-intestinal salmonella infections were caused by S. choleraesuis; however, we found S. typhimurium to be the predominant serotype. The mortality rate for patients in our series was considerably lower than the rate described for focal infections in other reviews. This may in part be due to lower proportion of infections due to S. choleraesuis, improved microbiologic and diagnostic techniques, increased use of ampicillin, and improved surgical techniques. Salmonella endocarditis usually occurs in patients with preexisting heart disease. Unlike other salmonella infections, S. choleraesuis is the most frequent serotype. Salmonella endocarditis is often very destructive, with a fatality rate of 70%. Nonvalvular (mural) endocarditis occurs in one-fourth of patients and survival has not been reported. While antibiotic therapy should be tried initially, if response is not prompt the clinician should look for an associated site of infection (intra- or extra-cardiac abscess), which will often require surgery. Salmonella pericarditis often presents with cardiac or pulmonary symptoms, but typical signs of pericardial disease (pulsus paradoxus, friction rub) or characteristic electrocardiographic changes (low voltage, elevated ST segments) are uncommon. Early diagnosis, before infection involves other areas of the heart, is crucial for survival. In addition to antibiotic therapy, pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy is required. Salmonella may infect the peripheral or visceral arteries, but the abdominal aorta is the most frequent site of vascular infection. Most patients are men over age 50 with preexisting atherosclerosis of the aorta who do not have a previous history of gastroenteritis. About one-fourth of patients have associated lumbar osteomyelitis. No patients have been reported to survive with medical therapy alone. Specific guidelines for surgical removal of infected aneurysms have been proposed and these (in addition to increased use of ampicillin) may be responsible for higher survival rates in recent years. Due to the high incidence of relapses, postoperative blood cultures should be done routinely. Arterial infection should be considered in any elderly patient with salmonella bacteremia especially with prolonged fever or bacteremia after an ""adequate course"" of antibiotic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The presence of mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene as well as an activated efflux pump and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes was determined. Resistance selection during therapy and the clonal relatedness of all isolates were established. Efflux pump inhibition did not appear to affect the MICs of ciprofloxacin and activity of the efflux pump appeared to be specific for nalidixic acid. Repeated exposure of the isolates to ciprofloxacin did not result in a significant increase in the MICs for ciprofloxacin. Repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) profiles identified five different genotypes, but no correlation with resistance was observed. However, a significant relation was found with geographic region; reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility was only found in travellers returning from India and Pakistan. All isolates with reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility had a mutation at position 83 in the QRDR region of the gyrA gene. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance was not found. These findings confirm that the reduced ciprofloxacin MIC in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A is solely due to an amino acid substitution in the QRDR 'cluster' of the gyrA gene."
CD008892,0,1311299,0,A BlnI restriction map of the Salmonella typhimurium LT2 genome.,"BlnI or AvrII (5'-CCTAGG) sites are very rare in the Salmonella typhimurium LT2 genome. BlnI was used to construct a physical map which was correlated with the genetic map by using three methods. First, Tn10 carries BlnI sites, and the extra restriction sites produced by 34 genetically mapped Tn10 insertions were physically mapped by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Second, six genetically mapped Mud-P22 prophage insertions were used to assign BlnI fragments. Integration of Mud-P22 introduces 30 kb of DNA that can easily be detected by a ""shift up"" in all but the largest BlnI fragments. Finally, induced Mud-P22 insertions package more than 100 kb of genomic DNA adjacent to one side of the insertion. Some of the smaller BlnI fragments were localized by hybridization to a dot blot array of 52 lysates from induced Mud-P22 insertions. Of the 10 BlnI sites mapped, 6 probably occur in or near the 16S rRNA genes at about 55, 71, 83, 86, 88.5, and 89.5 min. There is one BlnI site in the 90-kb pSLT plasmid. Two additional BlnI fragments of about 7 and 4 kb have not been localized. The size of the genome was estimated as 4.78 Mb (+/- 0.1 Mb) excluding pSLT but including prophages Fels-1 and Fels-2. One BlnI fragment that maps between 55 and 59 min showed a 40-kb reduction in size in a strain cured of the approximately 40-kb Fels-2 prophage."

CD008892,0,7890343,0,Hepatic manifestations in typhoid fever.,"Thirty one children with typhoid fever aged 2 months to 12 years and blood culture positive for multidrug resistant S. typhi were prospectively studied for their hepatic functions at the time of hospitalization and 2-3 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy. Hepatic manifestations included hepatomegaly (51.6%); jaundice (16.1%); raised levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (61.3%), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (48.4%), alkaline phosphatase (AP) (22.6%) and serum bilirubin (SB) (6.1%); reduced levels of serum albumin (SA) (41.9%); prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (9.7%) and abnormal ultrasound abdomen (19.3%). Hepatic dysfunction was a notable feature even in those cases without hepatomegaly, with raised levels of SGOT (60%), SGPT (40%), AP (20%), SB (6.7%), decreased SA (53.3%) and prolonged PT (6.7%). There was no correlation between the degree of hepatic enlargement or hyperbilirubinemia with abnormalities in liver functions. Hepatic dysfunction was noticed to be transient, as all these parameters returned to normal within 2-3 weeks after successful antibiotic therapy."
CD008892,0,14607870,0,Mimotopes of the Vi antigen of Salmonella enterica serovar typhi identified from phage display peptide library.,"The capsular polysaccharide Vi antigen (ViCPS) is an essential virulence factor and also a protective antigen of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. A random 12-mer phage-displayed peptide library was used to identify mimotopes (epitope analogues) of this antigen by panning against a ViCPS-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) ATVi. Approximately 75% of the phage clones selected in the fourth round carried the peptide sequence TSHHDSHGLHRV, and the rest of the clones harbored ENHSPVNIAHKL and other related sequences. These two sequences were also obtained in a similar panning process by using pooled sera from patients with a confirmed diagnosis of typhoid fever, suggesting they mimic immunodominant epitopes of ViCPS antigens. Binding of MAb ATVi to the mimotopes was specifically blocked by ViCPS, indicating that they interact with the same binding site (paratope) of the MAb. Data and reagents generated in this study have important implications for the development of peptide-base diagnostic tests and peptide vaccines and may also provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,12493915,0,Sir2-dependent activation of acetyl-CoA synthetase by deacetylation of active lysine.,"Acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (Acs) is an enzyme central to metabolism in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Acs synthesizes acetyl CoA from acetate, adenosine triphosphate, and CoA through an acetyl-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) intermediate. Immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis showed that Salmonella enterica Acs enzyme activity is posttranslationally regulated by acetylation of lysine-609. Acetylation blocks synthesis of the adenylate intermediate but does not affect the thioester-forming activity of the enzyme. Activation of the acetylated enzyme requires the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylase activity of the CobB Sir2 protein from S. enterica. We propose that acetylation modulates the activity of all the AMP-forming family of enzymes, including nonribosomal peptide synthetases, luciferase, and aryl- and acyl-CoA synthetases. These findings extend our knowledge of the roles of Sir2 proteins in gene silencing, chromosome stability, and cell aging and imply that lysine acetylation is a common regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes and prokaryotes."

Ceftriaxone was given to 28 patients in once-daily intravenous doses of 75 mg/kg of body weight to children and 4 g to adults for 5 days; chloramphenicol was given to 31 patients at a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day until defervescence and then at 40 mg/kg/day to complete 14 days of treatment. All Salmonella isolates were susceptible to both antibiotics. Clinical cures (defervescence without complications, no relapse, and no need for further treatment) occurred in 79% of the patients treated with ceftriaxone and 90% of those treated with chloramphenicol (P = 0.37). On the third day of treatment, blood cultures were positive for S. typhi for 60% of the patients in the chloramphenicol group and 0% of the ceftriaxone group (P = 0.001). Defervescence occurred in half the patients in both groups during the first 7 days, but on days 9 to 13 after the start of treatment, nine patients in the ceftriaxone group, compared with six patients in the chloramphenicol group, remained febrile (P = 0.4). The median hematocrit and total leukocyte counts at day 14 were significantly lower for the chloramphenicol group than those for the ceftriaxone group (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). These results indicate that the effects of therapy with ceftriaxone for typhoid fever differed from those of chloramphenicol therapy in that blood cultures became negative earlier, prolonged fever persisted in some patients, and bone marrow suppression was reduced. We conclude that a short, 5-day course of ceftriaxone is a useful alternative to conventional 14-day chloramphenicol therapy in the treatment of typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,9426140,0,"The FliP and FliR proteins of Salmonella typhimurium, putative components of the type III flagellar export apparatus, are located in the flagellar basal body.","Most of the structural components of the flagellum of Salmonella typhimurium are exported through a flagellum-specific pathway, which is a member of the family of type III secretory pathways. The export apparatus for this process is poorly understood. A previous study has shown that two proteins, about 23 and 26 kDa in size and of unknown genetic origin, are incorporated into the flagellar basal body at a very early stage of flagellar assembly. In the present study, we demonstrate that these basal body proteins are FliP (in its mature form after signal peptide cleavage) and FliR respectively. Both of these proteins have homologues in other type III secretion systems. By placing a FLAG epitope tag on FliR and the MS-ring protein FliF and immunoblotting isolated hook basal body complexes with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, we estimate (using the FLAG-tagged FliF as an internal reference) that the stoichiometry of FliR is fewer than three copies per basal body. An independent estimate of stoichiometry was made using data from an earlier quantitative radiolabelling analysis, yielding values of around four or five subunits per basal body for FliP and around one subunit per basal body for FliR. Immunoelectron microscopy using anti-FLAG antibody and gold-protein A suggests that FliR is located near the MS ring. We propose that the flagellar export apparatus contains FliP and FliR and that this apparatus is embedded in a patch of membrane in the central pore of the MS ring."
CD008892,0,3620049,0,Systemic and intestinal immunities after different typhoid vaccinations.,"The comparative studies of systemic and intestinal immunities to S. typhi were performed in 29 healthy volunteers during 2 years after receiving oral vaccination with attenuated S. typhi Ty21a in gelatin capsule, parenteral vaccination with acetone inactivated or heat inactivated-phenol preserved S. typhi Ty2. The methods used were immunobead ELISA for total secretory IgA and indirect ELISA for specific secretory IgA in the intestinal lavage fluid. The specific systemic IgG, IgM and anti-O, anti-H agglutinins were measured by indirect ELISA and Widal test respectively. The leukocyte migration inhibition test was used for the measurement of systemic cell mediated immunity. The results indicate that the oral S. typhi Ty21a stimulated intestinal immunity better than both parenteral vaccines but evoked less systemic antibody response. The stimulation of systemic cell-mediated immunity by the live attenuated and acetone inactivated vaccine was comparable while stimulation by heat inactivated-phenol preserved vaccine was less pronounced. The same studies were performed in 26 healthy volunteers during 6 months following different doses of oral vaccination with S. typhi Ty21a in enteric-coated capsule. The results suggest that the stimulation of intestinal and systemic immunities by this vaccine is dosage dependent. Three doses of vaccine provide better stimulation than two doses and one dose, respectively."
CD008892,0,25268134,0,"Characteristics of a dengue outbreak in a remote pacific island chain--Republic of The Marshall Islands, 2011-2012.","Dengue is a potentially fatal acute febrile illness caused by four mosquito-transmitted dengue viruses (DENV-1-4). Although dengue outbreaks regularly occur in many regions of the Pacific, little is known about dengue in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). To better understand dengue in RMI, we investigated an explosive outbreak that began in October 2011. Suspected cases were reported to the Ministry of Health, serum specimens were tested with a dengue rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and confirmatory testing was performed using RT-PCR and IgM ELISA. Laboratory-positive cases were defined by detection of DENV nonstructural protein 1 by RDT, DENV nucleic acid by RT-PCR, or anti-DENV IgM antibody by RDT or ELISA. Secondary infection was defined by detection of anti-DENV IgG antibody by ELISA in a laboratory-positive acute specimen. During the four months of the outbreak, 1,603 suspected dengue cases (3% of the RMI population) were reported. Of 867 (54%) laboratory-positive cases, 209 (24%) had dengue with warning signs, six (0.7%) had severe dengue, and none died. Dengue incidence was highest in residents of Majuro and individuals aged 10-29 years, and ∼95% of dengue cases were experiencing secondary infection. Only DENV-4 was detected by RT-PCR, which phylogenetic analysis demonstrated was most closely related to a virus previously identified in Southeast Asia. Cases of vertical DENV transmission, and DENV/Salmonella Typhi and DENV/Mycobacterium leprae co-infection were identified. Entomological surveys implicated water storage containers and discarded tires as the most important development sites for Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively. Although this is the first documented dengue outbreak in RMI, the age groups of cases and high prevalence of secondary infection demonstrate prior DENV circulation. Dengue surveillance should continue to be strengthened in RMI and throughout the Pacific to identify and rapidly respond to future outbreaks."

The serosurvey was based on doctors' request for the Weil Felix (WF) or the Indirect Immunoperoxidase (IIP) test in Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (PUO) patients for the years 1991 to 1997. Over the 7 years, we found that the incidence of Endemic typhus is increasing with gender (male:female = 2:1), age (20-40 years) and race distribution (Indians > Malay > Chinese) that reflects socioeconomic circumstances. A commercially available ELISA dot assay [INDX (E2R3) Dip-S-Ticks], for the detection of antibodies against R. typhi was compared with the indirect immunoperoxidase test (IIP). The ELISA assay was done against 219 IIP tested sera. The Dip-S-Ticks was found to be comparable to the IIP with a sensitivity of 91.7% and specificity of 92.8% at cut-off titres of > 1:80 IIP."

The clinical symptoms and signs of 35 patients were consistent with leptospirosis. The final diagnosis for the remaining patients was as follows: 136 with typhoid fever, 82 with hepatitis, 74 with malaria, 48 with infections of the respiratory tract, and 20 with fever of unknown origin. The clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis was confirmed for 24 (68.6%) patients by the combined results of the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), the reference test for leptospirosis, and of IgM ELISA, a standard laboratory test for the serodiagnosis of leptospirosis. In addition, serum specimens from 8 (2.2%) patients with a final clinical diagnosis other than leptospirosis were found to be positive in MAT and/or IgM ELISA. Compared with the results of MAT and IgM ELISA a sensitivity of 91.6% and specificity of 93.6% was calculated for the dipstick assay. Most of the serum samples from the laboratory confirmed patients gave a moderate to strong staining intensity of the antigen band of the dipstick and were easy to read.

Blood donor controls were screened with a slide agglutination test for the Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi O and H antigens, and positives were then tested with the Widal test. Acute- and convalescent-phase sera from patients in groups 2, 3, and 4 were obtained 7 to 10 days apart and tested by the Widal test. Using a cutoff of >or = 1/200 for the O antigen test performed on acute-phase serum gave a sensitivity of 52% and a specificity of 88% with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 76% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 71%.

CD008892,0,2286000,0,[Treatment of typhoid fever for three days with ceftriaxone].,"Due to mass tourism and the exodus of refugees from Africa and Asia, typhoid fever, common in the tropics, has reappeared in the more temperate climates. The clinical signs of prolonged fever, headache, general malaise, anorexia and abdominal pain are not specific enough to allow diagnosis and only a blood culture will prove the presence of the disease. Unless there is resistance, which is in fact rare in Southeast Asia, chloramphenicol, an effective, well tolerated and cheap antibiotic, remains the treatment of choice for typhoid. In the search for an alternative treatment a cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (Rocephin) seems promising. It has a low MIC of 0.05 micrograms/ml for S. typhi and a high level of biliary excretion which destroys S. typhi in the bile and thus prevents relapse. In Southeast Asia three consecutive studies, of which two were randomised and comparative with chloramphenicol given for 14 days, showed that treatment for two or three days, 3 or 4 g per day of ceftriaxone was as effective as chloramphenicol and was not followed by relapse. In 46 adults there was one failure with ceftriaxone (in an immunocompromised patient) and none in the 30 patients treated with chloramphenicol, three of which, however, relapsed in the 15 days after completion of treatment.

CD008892,0,6425219,0,Monoclonal antibody against a genus-specific antigen of Chlamydia species: location of the epitope on chlamydial lipopolysaccharide.,"Monoclonal antibodies were prepared by the fusion of murine myeloma NS1 cells with spleen cells of BALB/c mice immunized with Formalin-killed elementary bodies of the Chlamydia trachomatis L2 serovar. The specificity of these monoclonal antibodies was determined with a solid-phase immunoassay in which HeLa 229 cells infected with C. trachomatis serovars D, G, H, I, L2 and the Chlamydia psittaci meningopneumonitis strain Cal-10 were used. An immunoglobulin G3 monoclonal antibody (L2I-6) was identified that reacted with both C. trachomatis- and C. psittaci-infected HeLa cells. The immunoreactivity of the genus-specific epitope was heat resistant (100 degrees C, 10 min) but was destroyed by sodium metaperiodate treatment. Further characterization of the chlamydial specificity of monoclonal antibody L2I-6 by microimmunofluorescence showed that it was reactive with all 15 C. trachomatis serovars and seven C. psittaci strains isolated from five different animal species. We undertook studies to identify the biochemical nature of the chlamydial component on which the genus-specific epitope was located. The immunoreactive component was isolated by hot phenol-water extraction of dithiothreitol-reduced chlamydial elementary bodies. The component was positive in the Limulus amoebocyte lysate test (results of Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay were identical with those of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 SAI 377 Re lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), contained 8.8% 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid, was resistant to proteinase K, and possessed electrophoretic mobility and silver-staining characteristics in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis consistent with a rough LPS or glycolipid. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the genus-specific epitope recognized by monoclonal L2I-6 is located on chlamydial LPS. We further characterized the antigenic properties of the chlamydial LPS epitope by examining the immunoreactivity of monoclonal antibody L2I-6 by immunoblotting analyses against isolated LPSs extracted from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, S. typhimurium, and Escherichia coli. Monoclonal antibody L2I-6 did not bind LPS of these organisms, demonstrating that the chlamydial genus-specific LPS epitope is apparently not shared by these gram-negative bacteria. We were able, however, to show that the chlamydial LPS does share antigenic determinants with LPS of gram-negative organisms. Polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against S. typhimurium Re LPS or lipid A showed intense immunological cross-reactivity with chlamydial LPS by immunoblotting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD008892,0,9126435,0,Biological degradation of cyclophosphamide and its occurrence in sewage water.,"The mutagenic and cancerogenic antineoplastic agent cyclophosphamide (CP) is released into sewage water by cancer patient excretion. To assess the biological degradability of CP two standardized test systems, the Zahn-Wellens/EMPA test (OECD 302B) and a laboratory scale sewage treatment plant, were used. In both test systems the agent exhibited only poor degradability. To verify the expected occurrence of CP in hospital sewage, water samples were analyzed for CP with GC/MS after enrichment by solid-phase extraction. CP could be detected in concentrations ranging from 20 ng/L to 4.5 micrograms/L. The occurrence of the agent could also be proved in samples from the influent and the effluent of the communal sewage treatment plant into which the hospital's sewage water is shed. Concentrations ranged from 7 to 143 ng/L. In an attempt to assess the contribution of CP to the genotoxicity detected in hospital waste water in a recent study, the effects of CP in the umuC test, a bacterial genotoxicity assay, were investigated. However, no genotoxic effects of CP were found up to concentrations of 1 g/L."
CD008892,0,9871933,0,[Evaluation of the Widal test for diagnosing typhoid fever in Lebanon].,"Typhoid fever is a major public health problem in developing countries. In Lebanon, where the sanitary infrastructure was severely damaged during the civil war, the high prevalence of typhoid fever creates a pressing need for a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool. To evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of the Widal test, patients with a positive blood culture for Salmonella typhi (n = 78) were compared to controls with fever due to another infection (n = 65) and with blood donors (n = 96). Discrimination between the patient group and the two control groups was best when an agglutinin O titer of 1/160 or more was used. With this cutoff, sensitivity was 67.9%; specificity was 93.8% versus the febrile controls and 100% versus the blood donors. These results suggest that despite its well-known limitations the Widal test remains a valuable tool for typhoid fever control in many developing countries."

Five clones containing 35- to 45-kilobase inserts of S. enteritidis DNA reacted in colony immunoblot assays with a polyclonal antiserum prepared against purified S. enteritidis fimbriae. Electron microscopy showed that none of the five fimbrin-producing clones produced fimbriae, yet radioimmunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis located the 14,400-molecular-weight S. enteritidis in the outer membrane fraction of three of the clones and in the periplasmic fraction of all five clones. By using an oligonucleotide probe homologous to the 5' region of the fimbrin structural gene, the fimbrin gene was located on a 5.3-kilobase HindIII fragment. In vitro transcription-translation analysis verified that this HindIII fragment subcloned into plasmid pTZ18R produced unprocessed S. enteritidis fimbrin of molecular weight 16,400.

CD008892,0,12864957,0,Current trends in typhoid Fever.,"Typhoid fever, a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica serotype typhi, remains an important worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality. Endemic cases in the United States are unusual, with most following foreign travel to the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Asia, or Latin America. The classic findings of typhoid fever include rose spots, relative bradycardia, and stepwise fevers, but unfortunately these signs are frequently absent. Gastrointestinal manifestations may include diffuse abdominal pain, bleeding, perforation, cholecystitis, and cholangitis. The diagnosis should be suspected after collection of the appropriate clinical and travel history with confirmation by blood or bone marrow culture. Novel methods are in development to establish the diagnosis when cultures are negative or unavailable. Multidrug resistance has increased worldwide, and decisions on antimicrobial therapy must take such resistance into account. The empiric treatment of choice is a fluoroquinolone drug; ceftriaxone and azithromycin are alternatives. Preventive strategies include good sanitation and food handling practices along with vaccination of selected groups."

We enrolled 100 cases with blood culture-confirmed Salmonella typhi between July and October 1994 and 200 age-matched neighbourhood controls. Cases had a median age of 5.8 years. In a conditional logistic regression model, eating ice cream (Odds ratio [OR] = 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-4.2, attributable risk [AR] = 36%), eating food from a roadside cabin during the summer months (OR = 4.6, 95% CI 1.6-13.0; AR = 18%), taking antimicrobials in the 2 weeks preceding the onset of symptoms (OR = 5.7, 95% CI 2.3-13.9, AR = 21%), and drinking water at the work-site (OR = 44.0, 95% CI 2.8-680, AR = 8%) were all independently associated with typhoid fever. There was no difference in the microbiological water quality of home drinking water between cases and controls. Typhoid fever in Karachi resulted from high-dose exposures from multiple sources with individual susceptibility increased by young age and prior antimicrobial use. Improving commercial food hygiene and decreasing unnecessary antimicrobial use would be expected to decrease the burden of typhoid fever."

We examined the performance of Widal test in a community field site and compared it with Typhidot and Tubex tests for diagnosis of typhoid fever. Blood samples were collected from 6697 patients with fever for > or =3 days for microscopy, culture, and serologic testing and from randomly selected 172 consenting healthy individuals to assess the baseline Widal anti-Typhi O lipopolysaccharide antibody (anti-TO) and anti-Typhi H flagellar antibody (anti-TH) titers. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the 3 serologic tests were calculated using culture-confirmed typhoid fever cases as ""true positives"" and paratyphoid fever and malaria cases as ""true negatives"". Comparing cutoff values for the Widal test, an anti-TO titer of 1/80 was optimal with 58% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 69% PPV, and 77% NPV. Sensitivity was increased to 67% when the Widal test was done on the 5th day of illness and thereafter. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of Typhidot and Tubex were not better than Widal test. There is a need for more efficient rapid diagnostic test for typhoid fever especially during the acute stage of the disease. Until then, culture remains the method of choice."

S. aureus bacteremia was common among infants (69.2%), while children 1-5 years had a high frequency of typhoid (44%). Multi-drug-resistant S. Typhi was rare (6%). On multiple logistic regression analysis, typhoid was associated with younger age, longer illness, diarrhea, higher admission temperature, and lower peripheral white blood cell count than non-typhoidal bacteremia. Empirical parenteral ampicillin and gentamicin would have some activity against approximately 88% of clinically significant isolates at a cost of US $1.4/day, an important exception being B. pseudomallei.

Cefotaxime was added the following day because of the possibility of a nalidixic-acid resistant strain of S. typhi. The clinical course was complicated by a small bowel perforation on the third day of the disease. Blood cultures grew a nalidixic acid resistant strain of Salmonella enterica serovar typhi. The patient recovered completely. The second patient, a 22-year-old man, suffered from fever, malaise and hearing loss. A sensorineural hearing loss with vestibular dysfunction was diagnosed. Cultures of blood and bone marrow aspirate showed a nalidixic acid resistant strain of S. typhi. Treatment with ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime improved the hearing loss significantly. The clinical features of typhoid fever are heterogeneous and rare complications may occur. The emergence of multidrug and nalidixic acid resistance may complicate further the treatment of this serious systemic infection."

Nevertheless, within seven days he developed a mycotic aortic aneurysm, a serious but treatable complication. Its surgical management was successful. Rapid formation of mycotic aortic aneurysm represents a rare complication of a common disease, nontyphoidal salmonellosis. Atherosclerosis seems to be an important risk factor. Extensive work-up for mycotic aneurysm by CT-scan in patients older than 50 years, with nontyphoidal Salmonella -positive blood cultures, especially in the presence of risk factors for atherosclerosis, is prudent. However, blood and stool cultures of these patients can be negative in 15% and 35% of cases, respectively. And the results of the blood cultures may be delayed. So it is sensible to extend the previous recommendation to patients older than 50 years, with typical symptoms of nontyphoidal salmonellosis and imminent aneurysmatic rupture, independent of previous results of CT-scans, and blood or stool cultures."

A veronal buffer extract yielded precipitation lines against 50 (96%) out of 52 sera collected from patients with typhoid but against none out of 62 sera obtained from control subjects who did not have typhoid. Less satisfactory results were obtained by counterimmunoelectrophoresis when two other preparations, a protein extract (Barber antigen) and an ultrasonic lysate, were used as the antigens. By Widal test the rate of detection in patients' sera was 73% and the false-positive rate for control sera 16%. It is concluded that in an area where typhoid is endemic counterimmunoelectrophoresis using veronal buffer extract as the antigen is superior to the Widal test for serological diagnosis of typhoid fever. An additional advantage of counterimmunoelectrophoresis is that results may be obtained on the same day that the serum specimens are received."

This ELISA-Ty test measures the concentration of IgM and of IgG against S. typhi in serum. This test is an indirect ELISA test, based on a method that makes use of a mixture of OMPs (outer membrane proteins) in equal proportion serving as antigen, obtained from different strains of S. typhi which are prevalent locally, peroxidase goat antihuman IgG or IgM (Sigma) as conjugate and orthophenylenediamine (Sigma) as chromogen of the substrate. The result of the test was obtained through the assessment of the end product, using a micro ELISA reader (Behring) at wave length of 490 nm. The data revealed that the mean absorbent values found in children with typhoid fever, for IgM and IgG, were significantly higher (p < 0.05) when compared to those in children with non-typhoid fever as well as to those found in children of the control group. The results of this study confirm that the ELISA-Ty test has a high reliability for the detection of typhoid fever in children, based on the finding of a degree of diagnostic sensitivity as high as 95.45% and 90.91% for respectively IgM and IgG, a diagnostic specificity as high as 93.33% for IgM as well as for IgG, a high diagnostic efficiency (94.32% for IgM and 92.05% for IgG), a high diagnostic positive predictive value of 93.33% for IgM and 93.02% for IgG, high negative predictive values of 95.35% for IgM and 91.11% for IgG for use under clinical as well as under field conditions."
CD008892,0,25582856,0,β-arrestin1 is critical for the full activation of NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes.,"Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that trigger the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of IL-1β, which are critical for inflammation and control of pathogen infection. Although the function of inflammasomes in immune response and disease development is well studied, the molecular mechanism by which inflammasomes are activated and assembled remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that β-arrestin1, a key regulator of the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, was required for nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation, but it had no effect on absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome activation. Moreover, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) pyroptosome, which is ASC aggregation mediating caspase-1 activation, was also impaired in β-arrestin1-deficient macrophages upon NLRP3 or NLRC4, but not AIM2 inflammasome activation. Mechanistic study revealed that β-arrestin1 specifically interacted with NLRP3 and NLRC4 and promoted their self-oligomerization. In vivo, in a monosodium urate crystal (MSU)-induced NLRP3-dependent peritonitis model, MSU-induced IL-1β production and neutrophil flux were significantly reduced in β-arrestin1 knockout mice. Additionally, β-arrestin1 deficiency rescued the weight loss of mice upon log-phase Salmonella typhimurium infection, with less IL-1β production. Taken together, our results indicate that β-arrestin1 plays a critical role in the assembly and activation of two major canonical inflammasomes, and it may provide a new therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases."

Previous studies have shown that LPS induction of eicosanoid metabolism is transcription dependent and that prostaglandin (PG) H synthase is the committed step in the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) to thromboxane (Tx) B2. LPS tolerance induced by sublethal in vivo injections of LPS renders rats resistant to LPS in vivo and macrophages refractory to LPS-stimulated eicosanoid synthesis in vitro. This study examined potential activity and content changes in constitutive and mitogen inducible PGH synthase in LPS-stimulated control and tolerant macrophages. TxB2 levels were measured to evaluate basal PGH synthase activity and stimulation by Salmonella enteritidis LPS (50 micrograms/ml), calcium ionophore A-23187, and AA. All tolerant macrophage groups demonstrated decreased TxB2 synthesis. TxB2 synthesis stimulated by AA in tolerant cells was decreased by 70% (P < 0.05) compared with control macrophages. In subsequent studies changes in PGH synthase content were examined in rat peritoneal macrophages from tolerant and control rats incubated with and without LPS. Immunoblot analysis of PGH synthase-1 (constitutive) demonstrated no increase in cells stimulated with LPS compared with basal but was diminished by 62 +/- 9% (n = 4, P < 0.05) in tolerant macrophages compared with control cells. Immunoblot analysis of PGH synthase-2 (mitogen inducible) demonstrated induction in response to LPS that was maximal between 12 and 24 h. PGH synthase-2 was also induced in tolerant macrophages in response to LPS but was less than in control cells. The results demonstrate that endotoxin tolerance is associated with reduced activity and content of PGH synthase-1 and a decreased LPS induction of PGH synthase-2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The mean peak serum antibiotic concentration after a 0.5-g intravenous injection was 64.4 mug/ml, and the mean trough concentration, 3 h later, was 12.7 mug/ml. The highest serum inhibitory dilution at peak level was frequently 1/64, and at trough level it was 1/16 to 1/32. The acute infection was satisfactorily controlled in all patients. Phlebitis, complicating intravenous therapy, in five out of eight patients, was the only side effect observed. Relapse of typhoid fever, as documented by positive blood culture, occurred in one patient 11 days after treatment course was completed. More extensive clinical studies are required before drawing any conclusions regarding the efficacy of cefazolin in acute enteric fever."
CD008892,0,21276085,0,Robustness of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction for diagnostic applications.,"We evaluated the robustness of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of DNA for bacterial diagnostic applications. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi was used as the target organism and compared with a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for testing assay performance and reproducibly, as well as the impact of pH and temperature stability. This isothermal amplification method appeared to be particularly robust across 2 pH units (7.3-9.3) and temperature values (57-67 °C). The detection limit was comparable to that observed using optimized home-brew qPCR assays. The specificity of the amplification reaction remained high even at temperatures markedly different from the optimal one. Exposing reagents to the ambient temperature during the preparation of the reaction mixture as well as prolonging times for preparing the amplification reaction did not yield false-positive results. LAMP remained sensitive and specific despite the addition of untreated biological fluids such as stool or urine that commonly inhibit PCR amplification. Whereas the detection of microorganisms from whole blood or a blood-culture medium typically requires extensive sample purification and removal of inhibitors, LAMP amplification remained more sensitive than conventional qPCR when omitting such preparatory steps. Our results demonstrate that LAMP is not only easy to use, but is also a very robust, innovative and powerful molecular diagnostic method for both industrialized and developing countries."

CD008892,0,1958200,0,Demonstration of an antigenic protein specific for Salmonella typhi.,"Current studies were undertaken to determine the presence of a specific antigenic protein on the outer membrane of Salmonella typhi. Immunoblot analysis using sera from patients with fevers revealed that the 50 kD band was specifically recognized only by typhoid sera. The 50 kD band located on the outer membrane is protein by nature and is not a Vi (capsular), dH (flagellar), or O9 (somatic) antigen of S. typhi. These results indicate the usefulness of the specific antigen in the development of a serodiagnostic test for typhoid fever since antibodies of both the IgM and IgG class responses were obtained."
CD008892,0,1720777,0,Epitope mapping of four monoclonal antibodies recognizing the hexose core domain of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide.,"Four murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with distinctive regions of the hexose core domain of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were generated and their epitope specificities were delineated. MAST 56 (IgG1) and MAST 50 (IgG3) antibodies elicited by immunizations with Salmonella typhimurium Rb1 and Rb2 mutants, reacted selectively in enzyme immunoassay with the LPS from rough mutants. In contrast, MATy 1 (IgM) and MATy 2 (IgG2b) antibodies raised by an attenuated Salmonella typhi 620 Ty strain were reactive with LPS from both smooth and rough Salmonellae. Immunoblotting analysis showed that MATy 1 distinguished only the bottom bands (naked LPS core) among the heterogeneous LPS populations, whereas MATy 2 gave a ladder pattern (reactive with both naked and O-chain-substituted LPS cores). Differential binding specificities of MATy 1 and MATy 2 antibodies to the naked and capped LPS cores were further analyzed utilizing S. typhimurium polysaccharide fractions with different O-chain:core ratios which were obtained after separation by Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. Steric effects on the antibody reactivity by the bulky O-polysaccharide chain were detected. The use of chemically defined native and synthetic saccharides as inhibitors, in combination with the conformation of the Salmonella core oligosaccharide, permitted the definition of antigenic determinants carried in the core domain recognized by each antibody: (i) the branches I and VIII are essential for MATy 1 recognition, (ii) the backbone III-IV-V for MATy 2, (iii) the backbone II-III-IV-V for MAST 56, and (iv) the backbone plus the branch III-IV-V-VIII for MAST 50.

CD008892,0,14530123,0,[Enterobacterial susceptibility to antibiotics in northern Lebanon (1998-2001)].,"The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology of local enterobacterial susceptibility to antibiotics. Between 1 January, 1998, and 31 December, 2001, we studied the sensitivity of 2,238 Enterobacteria to 26 different antibiotic agents in northern Lebanon, in the Microbiology department and Laboratory of the Islami Hospital, Tripoli, Lebanon. We used the diffusion disk method and complied with the guidelines of the French Microbiology Society antibiogram committee. Urinary samples were the most frequent source (67.5%), followed by blood cultures (12.7%). The dominant species in blood cultures was S. typhi (44.7%). We found 194 strains that produced extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL), with the highest prevalence in Serratia spp. (44.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.7%), Escherichia coli (20.7%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (11.3%). The global susceptibility of these strains to aminopenicillin was 15%; it reached 30% when combined with clavulanic acid. Susceptibility of the ESBL strains to these agents was 0%. The global susceptibility (and that of the ESBL strains, when greater than 0%) to other antibiotics was as follows: ticarcillin 38.5%, piperacillin 38.5%, piperacillin-tazobactam 88% (64%), imipenem 99.4%, (100%), cefalexin 41%, cefoxitin 65% (40.3%), cefuroxime 75%, amikacin 89%, chloramphenicol 30%, gentamicin 78% (42%), tetracycline 28% (16%), minocycline 30% (18.4%), colistin 67% (75%), nitrofuran 40% (45%), cotrimoxazol 40% (13%), nalidixic acid 53% (5.6%), pefloxacin 63% (23%), ciprofloxacin 71% (39%), and levofloxacin 72% (47%)."
CD008892,0,7608172,0,Structure/function analysis of the periplasmic histidine-binding protein. Mutations decreasing ligand binding alter the properties of the conformational change and of the closed form.,"The periplasmic histidine-binding protein, HisJ, is a receptor for the histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium. Receptors of this type are composed of two lobes that are far apart in the unliganded structure (open conformation) and drawn close together in the liganded structure (closed conformation). The binding of the ligand, in a cleft between the lobes, stabilizes the closed conformation. Such receptors have several functions in transport: interaction with the membrane-bound complex, transmission of a transmembrane signal to hydrolyze ATP, and receiving a signal to open the lobes and release the ligand. In this study the mechanism of action of HisJ was further investigated using mutant proteins defective in ligand binding activity and closed form-specific monoclonal antibodies (Wolf, A., Shaw, E. W., Nikaido, K., and Ames G. F.-L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23051-23058). Y14H is defective in stabilization of the closed form, does not assume the closed empty form, and assumes an altered closed liganded form. T121A and G119R are similar to Y14H, but assume a normal closed liganded form. S72P binds the ligand to the open form, but does not assume a recognizable closed form. S92F is defective in the ability to undergo conformational change and to stabilize the closed form. All other mutant proteins appear to fall within one of these four categories. The biochemical characterization of these mutant proteins agrees with the structural analysis of the protein. We suggest that mutant proteins that do not assume the normal closed form, in addition to their defect in ligand binding, fail to interact with the membrane-bound complex and/or to transmit transmembrane signals."

CD008892,0,16824040,0,Caspase-1-dependent pore formation during pyroptosis leads to osmotic lysis of infected host macrophages.,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium invades host macrophages and induces a unique caspase-1-dependent pathway of cell death termed pyroptosis, which is activated during bacterial infection in vivo. We demonstrate DNA cleavage during pyroptosis results from caspase-1-stimulated nuclease activity. Although poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation by fragmented DNA depletes cellular ATP to cause lysis during oncosis, the rapid lysis characteristic of Salmonella-infected macrophages does not require PARP activity or DNA fragmentation. Membrane pores between 1.1 and 2.4 nm in diameter form during pyroptosis of host cells and cause swelling and osmotic lysis. Pore formation requires host cell actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and caspase-1 activity, as well as the bacterial type III secretion system (TTSS); however, insertion of functional TTSS translocons into the host membrane is not sufficient to directly evoke pore formation. Concurrent with pore formation, inflammatory cytokines are released from infected macrophages. This mechanism of caspase-1-mediated cell death provides additional experimental evidence supporting pyroptosis as a novel pathway of inflammatory programmed cell death."
CD008892,0,8086546,0,Analysis of factors influencing the outcome and development of septic metastasis or relapse in Salmonella bacteremia.,"One-hundred seventy-two consecutive adult patients with salmonella bacteremia documented by at least one positive blood culture were prospectively evaluated over a 10-year period. Salmonella enteritidis was isolated in 121 cases (70.3%), Salmonella typhimurium in 29 (16.9%), and other Salmonella species in 22 (12.8%). Twenty-seven patients (15.7%) developed septic metastasis; 21 patients (12.2%) died of bacteremia, and 24 (16.7%) of the 144 patients who survived had at least one relapse. A logistic regression analysis selected three variables as independently influencing outcome: septic shock (P = .005), coma (P = .029), and immunosuppression (P = .04). By means of the same statistical analysis, leukopenia (a white blood cell count of < 4 x 10(9)/L) was identified as an independent risk factor for relapse (P < .0001). The possibility of salmonella bacteremia must be considered when immunosuppressed patients have fever and no obvious source of infection. Treatment with a drug active against Salmonella species is essential in this population. Patients with leukopenia should be considered as recipients of prophylaxis for relapse."

CD008892,0,25597967,0,"Plane of nutrition influences the performance, innate leukocyte responses, and resistance to an oral Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium challenge in Jersey calves.","Two experiments investigated how plane of nutrition influences performance, leukocyte responses, and resistance to an oral Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium challenge. In experiment 1, 46 (2±1 d of age) calves were randomly assigned to 2 diets: a low (LPN; n=23) and high plane of nutrition (HPN; n=23). The LPN calves were fed 409 g/d of dry matter (DM) of a 20% crude protein and 20% fat milk replacer, whereas HPN calves were fed 610 and 735 g/d of DM of a 28% crude protein and 25% fat milk replacer during wk 1 and 2 to 6, respectively. In experiment 2, 20 bull calves (LPN; n=11 and HPN; n=9) were orally challenged on d 80 with 1.5×10(7) cfu of Salmonella Typhimurium (ATCC #14028). The HPN calves had a greater incidence (87.5 vs. 45.5%) and duration of days with high fecal scores (5.5 vs. 3.5 d). The LPN calves had greater neutrophil surface expression of L-selectin on d 7, 21, and 42. Following the Salmonella Typhimurium challenge, calf starter DM intake was greater among the HPN calves. The percentage of neutrophils producing an oxidative burst was also greater among HPN calves on d 1 to 5 after the challenge. Similarly, the intensity of the oxidative burst tended to be greater among the HPN calves on d 2 and 3 postchallenge. The secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α from whole-blood cultures stimulated with lipopolysaccharide tended to be greater on d 1 and was greater on d 5 and 6 among HPN calves. The median ranks of haptoglobin concentrations were greater and plasma zinc concentrations tended to be decreased among LPN calves. These data indicate that feeding a HPN to Jersey calves improved average daily gain and feed efficiency, but increased the incidence of high fecal scores during the first few weeks of life; however, the HPN Jersey calves may be more resistant to Salmonella Typhimurium after weaning."

Clinical signs of shock were pronounced; the electrocardiogram, initially not pathological, showed a peripheral low voltage with decreased R-amplitudes and distinct disturbances in repolarization. Laboratory findings demonstrating Salmonella typhimurium in blood cultures and stools and 45% band forms in the differential count were remarkable. The autopsy showed deep, fibrin-covered ulcera in the colon area and a dense submucous lympho-histiocyte cell infiltration. Histologically, a granulomatous myocarditis of the left ventricle with lymphocyte and histiocyte infiltration and a focal myolysis was observed. In the right ventricle, however, only a minimal interstitial edema was found."
CD008892,0,10648530,0,Insertional inactivation of genes encoding components of the sodium-type flagellar motor and switch of Vibrio parahaemolyticus.,"Vibrio parahaemolyticus possesses two types of flagella, polar and lateral, powered by distinct energy sources, which are derived from the sodium and proton motive forces, respectively. Although proton-powered flagella in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium have been extensively studied, the mechanism of torque generation is still not understood. Molecular knowledge of the structure of the sodium-driven motor is only now being developed. In this work, we identify the switch components, FliG, FliM, and FliN, of the sodium-type motor. This brings the total number of genes identified as pertinent to polar motor function to seven. Both FliM and FliN possess charged domains not found in proton-type homologs; however, they can interact with the proton-type motor of E. coli to a limited extent. Residues known to be critical for torque generation in the proton-type motor are conserved in the sodium-type motor, suggesting a common mechanism for energy transfer at the rotor-stator interface regardless of the driving force powering rotation. Mutants representing a complete panel of insertionally inactivated switch and motor genes were constructed. All of these mutants were defective in sodium-driven swimming motility. Alkaline phosphatase could be fused to the C termini of MotB and MotY without abolishing motility, whereas deletion of the unusual, highly charged C-terminal domain of FliM disrupted motor function. All of the mutants retained proton-driven, lateral motility over surfaces. Thus, although central chemotaxis genes are shared by the polar and lateral systems, genes encoding the switch components, as well as the motor genes, are distinct for each motility system."
CD008892,0,2258347,0,The efficacy and safety of pefloxacin in the treatment of typhoid fever in Algeria.,"The efficacy and safety of pefloxacin 400 mg twice daily for seven days in the treatment of typhoid fever was investigated in an open, non-comparative study involving 37 patients infected with Salmonella typhi. Between day 5 and the end of treatment, all patients showed clinical improvement. The clinical cure rate at the end of the treatment period was 89.2%. One month after the end of treatment, the final assessment showed a clinical cure rate of 94.6% with relapses occurring in only two patients. Both these patients belonged to the group with negative blood cultures but positive serodiagnostic tests. Bacteriological tests confirmed eradication of the pathogen in 94.6% of patients and the relapses in the two serologically positive patients. Temperature became normal in a mean of 5.14 days. Clinical adverse reactions were reported in 5.9% (3/51) of patients (vomiting in two, transient pruritic rash in one). The results of this study indicate that a seven-day course of pefloxacin 400 mg twice daily provides a suitable alternative in the treatment of typhoid fever."

The common clinical features were fever (100%), vomiting (58%), abdominal pain (48%), cough (22%) and loose stools (14%) and the Widal test was positive in 75% patients. Eighty per cent of the salmonella isolates were resistant to amoxycillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole drugs, but all were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Forty patients developed complications: encephalopathy (18), melaena (12), haematemesis (10), epistaxis (4), hepatitis (4), acalculous cholecystitis (4), bowel perforation (3) and nephritis (2). Complications were more frequent in children with multidrug-resistant typhoid. The final antibiotic required to render the children afebrile included ciprofloxacin (80), ceftriaxone, amoxycillin (4), chloramphenicol (4), amoxycillin and gentamicin (4), amoxycillin with chloramphenicol (2), and furazolidone (2).

Laboratory findings revealed a slight cholestasis and elevation of acute phase protein levels. In the blood culture a Salmonella Kapemba-type organism was cultured. The patient was afebrile for 10 days after hospitalization and then suddenly developed a temperature of 40 degrees C again. At the same time leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a rise of D-dimer levels were detected. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for a few days, because a disseminated intravascular coagulation was suspected. With magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy no osteomyelitis or abscess formation could be found. A transesophageal ultrasonography of the heart revealed no signs of endocarditis. In multiple stool cultures no salmonellas could be detected. After antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin the fever and lower back pain subsided, and the patient was discharged a fortnight later. This is the first reported case of typhoid fever due to the bacterium Salmonella Kapemba."

We examined the S. paratyphi B isolates from 14 of these patients (10 from blood cultures, 4 from stool specimens) who were admitted to 2 hospitals in Bergen, Norway during August and September 1999. Moreover, during the same period, a laboratory technician working at 1 of these hospitals was admitted with S. paratyphi B septicemia and was included in the study. Using repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) with 2 primer pairs (ERIC and REP), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and phage typing we found that the laboratory technician was infected with the same S. paratyphi B clone as the 14 tourists. The discriminatory capacity of the rep-PCR method and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was examined using S. paratyphi B strains from the outbreak and from other geographical locations. We conclude that a combination of rep-PCR with the ERIC primer pair and phage typing was useful in discriminating between the epidemic isolates and epidemiologically unrelated isolates from S. paratyphi B infections and that the laboratory technician was most likely infected while handling patient samples or bacterial cultures from the Turkish tourists."
CD008892,0,17642539,0,Study of predominant bacterial antigens triggering antibody response in Salmonella reactive arthritis: apropos of a case.,"Reactive arthritis (ReA) is a sterile arthritis triggered by distal mucosal infection, which suggests a contribution from bacterial products. The pathogenesis of ReA is unclear. There are no international standards for the serological methods used to confirm ReA. In the present work, we analyzed the predominant bacterial component that triggered an immune response in a 24-year-old woman with acute ReA. The candidate bacterial trigger was investigated by measuring the antibacterial antibodies (all immunoglobulin classes and IgA) to Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella flexneri and Yersinia enterocolitica. ELISA for Salmonella gave a positive result. To identify the bacterial component triggering ReA, antibodies to crude lysate, outer membrane proteins (OMP), cytosolic fraction, supernatant proteins and lipopolysaccharide of S. enteritidis were analyzed in sera and synovial fluid (SF) by ELISA, dot blot, and Western blot. Among the antigen preparations, the antibody response to OMP was dominant in both serum and SF; a strong reaction to seven OMP bands (50-21 kDa) was observed. We concluded that OMP were the main bacterial antigens that trigged ReA in the reported case. Determining the triggering bacterial components in each case can help elucidate the precise causes of ReA and will contribute to the designing of a specific serological diagnostic method for this arthritis."

Blood cultures from 105 of the 188 patients with proved or presumptive cases of typhoid fever grew Salmonella typhi. The clinical and laboratory findings in these patients were reviewed. Fever, usually with temperatures above 38.8 degrees C and of the sustained type, was a primary manifestation of disease, although a majority of the patients also complained of headache and gastroenteric symptoms. Hepatic or splenic enlargement was present in 52 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, whereas rose spots were detected in only 13 per cent. The total leukocyte count was normal in 74 per cent, but serum levels of liver and muscle enzymes were frequently elevated. Gastrointestinal, pulmonary and neurologic complications were infrequent; circulatory failure was not observed. Defervescence in response to antibiotic therapy was variable; however, the median response among 68 patients who received chloramphenicol was two days less than that in 34 patients treated with ampicillin. There was one possible treatment failure with ampicillin. The relapse rate of 10 per cent in chloramphenicol-treated patients was not significantly greater than the 3 per cent rate among those treated with ampicillin. Serologic studies for typhoid fever were of limited diagnostic value since the titer of agglutinins was 1:160 or higher in 49 per cent of the serums obtained before treatment, and a fourfold rise in titer occurred in only 24 per cent of 57 patients studied. The serologic response to chloramphenicol treatment did not differ from that to ampicillin."

The blood specimen was used for cultural diagnosis and malaria parasite (MP) test, while serum from the blood was screened by Widal test. The remaining specimens (bone marrow aspirate, stool and urine) were only used for cultural diagnosis, but their cultural diagnostic sensitivity were only calculated from the patients whose Widal tests were positive. The widal test showed that 21(25%) had significant reciprocal titre levels of > 80 and > 160 for O and H antigens respectively. Malaria parasites test also had 23(37.4%) cases positive with 1(4.4%) and 22(95.7%) of them positive and negative by widal test respectively. Stool, blood and bone marrow aspirate were 33%, 28.6% and 38.1% sensitive respectively, while the diagnostic sensitivity of urine was zero. In the diagnosis of enteric fever, it is suggested that the presumptive serology test (Widal) be carried out along with cultures from bone marrow aspirate and stool where the former is affordable and available. Malaria parasite microscopy should also be done because majority of the suspected enteric fevers may actually only be malaria fever in an environment like Nigeria which is endemic for the two diseases (malaria and typhoid fever)."

Since the initial description, several aetiologies have been discussed, and among them, paratyphoid fever is very uncommon. After her return from a trip, a 25-year-old girl developed high fever and diarrhoea. Examination of the vulva revealed a genital ulcer. The rest of the general examination was normal. Blood cultures identified Salmonella paratyphi A, and a diagnosis of Lipschütz's ulcer associated with paratyphoid fever was made. Bacteriaemia was then treated with antibiotics and the vulvar ulceration rapidly disappeared. Lipschütz described a distinctive clinical entity of acute genital ulcers occurring in adolescents. To our knowledge, we report herein the second case associated with proved paratyphoid fever.

The diagnosis is often empirical because the yield of blood cultures is low. It is difficult to differentiate BC from other febrile episodes. In order to characterize the clinical and laboratory features of BC in patients with BA, identify risk factors, and correlate cholangitis with outcome, 37 patients with BA from 1993 to 1998 who underwent a Kasai operation in our hospital were studied. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 59 months. A total of 107 febrile episodes were documented in these patients. The diagnostic criteria for cholangitis were fever, increased jaundice, or acholic stools. The clinical features, laboratory data, results of bacterial cultures, and outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 107 febrile episodes, including 78 bouts of cholangitis and 29 non-cholangitis infections, were found in 34 patients. Patients with BC had higher postoperative bilirubin levels (P = 0.02) and less frequent use of prophylactic antibiotics (P = 0.05) than those with non-cholangitis infections. Abnormal white blood cell counts (> 12,000 or <4,000 mm3) tended to be present in patients with BC (P = 0.08). There were no statistical differences in the risk factors and laboratory data between culture-positive (n = 16) and -negative (n = 62) cholangitis cases. The occurrence of cholangitis significantly reduced survival in both patients with good (P = 0.03) and inadequate bile flow (P = 0.03). All 9 patients who had never had cholangitis survived during the follow-up period. Repeated attacks of BC further decreased survival probability. The responsive organisms were mainly enteric bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanni, and Salmonella typhi. The sensitivity tests justified empirical therapy with ceftriaxone. The effectiveness of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or neomycin warrants further studies. BC was a highly prevalent postoperative complication in patients with BA, especially those with inadequate bile drainage. It significantly affected early mortality. Aggressive and complete treatment with empirical ceftriaxone was appropriate."

Healthy adult volunteers ingested a single dose of 5 x 10(5) to 5 x 10(8) CFU of strain chi4073 (delta cya delta crp delta cdt S. typhi Ty2), 6 x 10(7) or 1 x 10(9) CFU of strain chi4632(pYA3149), a further derivative of chi4073 deleted in asd and containing the Asd+ vector without the HBc-pre-S fusion, or 3 x 10(7) or 7 x 10(8) CFU of strain X4632(pYA3167), a derivative containing the vector with the HBc-pre-S fusion. Chi4073 was generally well tolerated by 22 volunteers. No volunteer had fever or positive blood cultures; 4 of 22 volunteers shed vaccine organisms in the stool in the first 48 h only. Two of 18 volunteers who received one of the plasmid-containing derivatives of chi4073 developed low-grade fevers on day 10 or 12 after ingestion. One of these volunteers had positive blood cultures on days 7 and 8. Seven of these 18 volunteers had vaccine organisms detected in their stools in the first 48 h only. Most volunteers developed S. typhi-specific serum responses and developed S. typhi-specific antibody-secreting cells. However, no volunteer developed serum antibody to hepatitis pre-S or pre-S-specific antibody-secreting cells. Although the parent strain chi4073 was well tolerated, induced immunoglobulin G seroconversion to S. typhi lipopolysaccharide in 80 to 100% of vaccinees and stimulated specific IgA-secreting lymphocytes in 80 to 100% of vaccinees given a single oral dose of 2 x 10(7) and 5 x 10(8) CFU, chi4073 derivatives containing the Asd+ vector with and without sequences encoding the HBc-pre-S fusion caused occasional febrile reactions at high doses and did not stimulate detectable immune responses to hepatitis B antigens."

However, because little is known about the antigens that elicit antibody production in response to Bartonella infections, this project was undertaken to identify and molecularly characterize these immunogens. Immunologic screening of a Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genomic expression library with anti-Bartonella antibodies led to the identification of the sucB gene, which encodes the enzyme dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase. Antiserum from a mouse experimentally infected with live Bartonella was reactive against recombinant SucB, indicating the mounting of an anti-SucB response following infection. Antigenic cross-reactivity was observed with antiserum against other Bartonella spp. Antibodies against Coxiella burnetti, Francisella tularensis, and Rickettsia typhi also reacted with our recombinant Bartonella SucB. Potential SucB antigenic cross-reactivity presents a challenge to the development of serodiagnostic tests for other intracellular pathogens that cause diseases such as Q fever, rickettsioses, brucelloses, tularemia, and other bartonelloses."

To identify a more convenient method to administer vaccine and to determine the feasibility of immunizing with a single dose, we studied the immune response of children and adults to different formulations of Ty21a with a newly developed, sensitive, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In this ELISA, a rise in S. typhi O antibody was defined as a change in net optical density of greater than or equal to 0.15 (more than 3 SD from the mean difference in optical density in a negative control population). Three hundred and thirty-five Chilean children were given 3 doses of 10(9) Ty21a in 150 ml of milk with 0.8 g NaHCO3 or in enteric-coated capsules. In each group, 5% seroconverted by Widal O but 41% by IgG ELISA O antibody titers; mean antibody levels by group were identical. Studies were also carried out in healthy college students in a non-endemic area (U.S.A.) who had no history of prior typhoid immunization. In total, 141 U.S. adults received vaccine formulated in either one of two ways: 1) in gelatin capsules administered with two additional gelatin capsules containing a total of 0.8 gm NaHCO3 or 2) in enteric-coated capsules. Thirty-six persons received one dose, 30 got two doses and 16 ingested three doses of enteric-coated vaccines, while 44 persons receiving one dose and 15 got two doses of vaccine in the gelatin capsule formulation. Rates of seroconversion of ELISA O antibody were similar in all the groups. Ty21a vaccine was not recovered from multiple stool, jejunal fluid or blood cultures of the U.S. vaccine recipients.

We have developed a preparative procedure for flagellar motors that retains these proteins as evidenced by Western blots using anti-FliG, anti-FliM and anti-FliN antibodies. Immunogold labeling with these three antibodies shows that the three switch proteins are localized to the motor. Electron micrographs of frozen-hydrated preparations reveal a large, new component we have termed the ""C ring complex"" attached to the cytoplasmic face of the M ring. In a three-dimensional reconstruction of the cylindrically averaged structure, the M-S ring complex appears thicker and wider by the addition of extra material to the cytoplasmic surface of the M ring. In addition, extending into the cytoplasm from the thickened M ring is the C ring complex, a thin-walled cylinder having a length of 170 A and an outer diameter of 450 A compared to the 290 A diameter of the M ring. We provide evidence that the thickened M ring contains FliG and that the C ring complex may contain FliM and FliN.

We previously synthesized and characterized a novel small-molecule agent, AR-12, that induces autophagy and inhibits the Akt kinase in cancer cells. As both autophagy and the Akt kinase have been shown recently to play roles in the intracellular survival of several intracellular bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, we investigated the effect of AR-12 on the intracellular survival of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium in macrophages. Our results show that AR-12 induces autophagy in macrophages, as indicated by increased autophagosome formation, and potently inhibits the survival of serovar Typhimurium in macrophages in association with increased colocalization of intracellular bacteria with autophagosomes. Intracellular bacterial growth was partially rescued in the presence of AR-12 by the short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Beclin-1 or Atg7 in macrophages. Moreover, AR-12 inhibits Akt kinase activity in infected macrophages, which we show to be important for its antibacterial effect as the enforced expression of constitutively activated Akt1 in these cells reverses the AR-12-induced inhibition of intracellular serovar Typhimurium survival. Finally, oral administration of AR-12 at 2.5 mg/kg/day to serovar Typhimurium-infected mice reduced hepatic and splenic bacterial burdens and significantly prolonged survival. These findings show that AR-12 represents a proof of principle that the survival of intracellular bacteria can be suppressed by small-molecule agents that target both innate immunity and host cell factors modulated by bacteria."

Performance Tested Method 960801.,"Reveal Salmonella 2.0 is an improved version of the original Reveal Salmonella lateral flow immunoassay and is applicable to the detection of Salmonella enterica serogroups A-E in a variety of food and environmental samples. A Performance Tested Method validation study was conducted to compare performance of the Reveal 2.0 method with that of the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Food Safety and Inspection Service or U.S. Food and Drug Administration/Bacteriological Analytical Manual reference culture methods for detection of Salmonella spp. in chicken carcass rinse, raw ground turkey, raw ground beef, hot dogs, raw shrimp, a ready-to-eat meal product, dry pet food, ice cream, spinach, cantaloupe, peanut butter, stainless steel surface, and sprout irrigation water. In a total of 17 trials performed internally and four trials performed in an independent laboratory, there were no statistically significant differences in performance of the Reveal 2.0 and reference culture procedures as determined by Chi-square analysis, with the exception of one trial with stainless steel surface and one trial with sprout irrigation water where there were significantly more positive results by the Reveal 2.0 method. Considering all data generated in testing food samples using enrichment procedures specifically designed for the Reveal method, overall sensitivity of the Reveal method relative to the reference culture methods was 99%. In testing environmental samples, sensitivity of the Reveal method relative to the reference culture method was 164%. For select foods, use of the Reveal test in conjunction with reference method enrichment resulted in overall sensitivity of 92%. There were no unconfirmed positive results on uninoculated control samples in any trials for specificity of 100%. In inclusivity testing, 102 different Salmonella serovars belonging to serogroups A-E were tested and 99 were consistently positive in the Reveal test. In exclusivity testing of 33 strains of non-salmonellae representing 14 genera, 32 were negative when tested with Reveal following nonselective enrichment, and the remaining strain was found to be substantially inhibited by the enrichment media used with the Reveal method.

For that purpose, we developed four different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), i.e., an indirect ELISA with S. enteritidis flagellin, an indirect ELISA with S. enteritidis lipopolysaccharide, a double-antibody sandwich blocking ELISA that uses monoclonal antibodies against S. enteritidis flagellin (GM-DAS blocking ELISA), and a double-antibody sandwich ELISA that uses monoclonal antibodies against S. enteritidis lipopolysaccharide. In the present study, we compare the results of those ELISAs with sera from experimentally infected 1-day-old chickens and with sera and eggs from experimentally infected laying hens. Experimental infections were induced with strains of S. enteritidis phage types 1 and 2, S. typhimurium, and S. panama. Sera were collected up to days 44 and 39 after infection from 1-day-old chickens and laying hens, respectively. Only the GM-DAS blocking ELISA was able to discriminate between S. enteritidis infections and infections with the other serotypes. This ELISA had both a sensitivity and a specificity of 100% for all serum samples from experimentally infected chickens.

CD008892,0,16149103,0,One-bead-one-inhibitor-one-substrate screening of neuraminidase activity.,"Given the eminent threat of a 21st century flu pandemic, the search for novel antiviral compounds is an increasingly important area of research. Recent developments in antiviral research have established the viability of targeting viral neuraminidase (NA), an enzyme that cleaves sialic acid from the cell-surface-mediating passage of the virus in the respiratory tract. N-acetyl neuraminic acid (NeuAc) is the substrate for NA, and analogues of this core structure have been commercialized as antiviral therapeutics. Recent studies have established that this system is well suited for combinatorial approaches to drug discovery. An important step in the process is to develop solid-phase screening technologies. The feasibility of performing competitive solid-phase NA assays is reported herein. Initially, a fluorogenic NeuAc substrate was immobilized on solid support, and the ability of three NAs (Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, and Vibrio cholerae) to cleave the substrate was shown to be analogous to solution-phase assays. The solid support was then bifunctionalized with the fluorogenic NeuAc substrate and one of two known inhibitors (DANA and Zanamivir). The ability of NA to cleave NeuAc from the solid support when simultaneously presented with an inhibitor was shown to be enzyme dependent. As expected, simultaneous presentation of NeuAc and DANA, a nonspecific inhibitor, led to diminished activity for all three enzymes tested. In contrast, dual presentation of NeuAc and the selective inhibitor Zanamivir only showed significant activity against Vibrio cholerae."

Salmonella typhi O and H agglutinin titres > 1:80 and > 1:160 were considered to be significant with 88% sensitivity and 98% specificity, respectively. Among the bacteriologically proven cases, 11.3% showed no response to either agglutinin, and in another 17.3% of cases there was no response for TO agglutinin. This study suggests that in children in an endemic area a positive Widal test is of considerable importance in diagnosing typhoid fever. Furthermore, negative results should be interpreted with caution and both the agglutinins must be considered equally important. Reliance on somatic (TO) antigen only will result in missed diagnosis."

Newborn infants up to 3 months are considered particularly vulnerable for bloodstream invasion with nontyphoid salmonellae. Patients with chronic consuming disorders, solid tumors and haematologic malignancies, and the treatment of these ailments with immunosuppressive drugs and corticosteroids predisposes patients for extraintestinal spread of an enteric salmonella infection.

Surface translocation of cells on plates and adherence to glass and polystyrene surfaces in biofilm assays are further characteristics of the morphotype. This morphotype (rdar) is normally expressed only at low temperature. However, in two unrelated S. typhimurium strains, spontaneous mutants were found forming rdar colonies independent of temperature. Allelic replacement proved a single point mutation in the promoter region of PagfD in each of the two mutants to be responsible for the constitutive phenotype of a multicellular behaviour. Transcription levels of the two divergently transcribed agf operons required for biogenesis of thin aggregative fimbriae by Northern blot analysis with gene probes for agfA and agfD as well as expression levels of AgfA by Western blotting were compared in the wild type, the constitutive mutants and their respective ompR and rpoS- derivatives. In the wild type the rdar morphotype and expression of thin aggregative fimbriae are restricted to low temperature on plates containing rich medium of low osmolarity, but biogenesis of thin aggregative fimbriae occurs upon iron starvation at 37 degrees C. In the upregulated mutants biogenesis of thin aggregative fimbriae is only abolished at high osmolarity at 37 degrees C and in the exponential phase in broth culture. Control of expression of thin aggregative fimbriae and rdar morphology takes place at the transcriptional level at the agfD promoter. A functional ompR allele is required, however an rpoS mutation abolishes transcription only in the wild type, but has no influence on expression of thin aggregative fimbriae in the constitutive mutants."

In 40 patients with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid fever, significant dot immunobinding titers (> or =20,000) were present in 28 (70%) tested with 100 ng of ST O antigen-HSA (ST O-HSA) conjugate, in 38 (95%) tested with 100 ng of ST lipopolysaccharide, and in 16 (40%) tested with purified unconjugated ST O chains. In sera from 22 patients with other nontyphoid fevers, 2 (9.1%) had such reactivities with 100 ng of ST O-HSA, 1 (4.5%) had such reactivity with 100 ng of ST lipopolysaccharide (4.5%), and none reacted with 100 ng of unconjugated ST O chains. None of the 17 healthy-control sera reacted significantly with any of the ST reagents. None of the patient or control sera reacted with unconjugated HSA. The sensitivity of dot immunobinding for typhoid fever was 70% with 100 ng of ST O-HSA, somewhat lower than that with 100 ng of ST lipopolysaccharide (95%) but similar to that of the Widal H agglutination test with a > or =1/160 cutoff (74%). Specificities of these tests were 91%, 95%, and 86%, respectively. These preliminary results suggest that ST O polysaccharide-protein conjugates could provide a nontoxic, easily quality-controlled synthetic reagent for analysis of human immune responses to ST as well as for the development of new diagnostics and vaccines for typhoid fever."

These data show an epidemic increase in clonally related multidrug-resistant Salmonella bloodstream infection in children in DR Congo."

Salmonella typhi O agglutinins were found at a titre of 1.320 in 12 (10.5%) of them. Salmonella paratyphi A agglutinins were found at 1.160 in 5 (4.3%) and Salmonella paratyphi B ""O"" agglutinins were found in 6 (5.3%) at a titre of 1.160. None of these individuals had a history of typhoid fever or vaccination with TAB vaccine. The following points emerged: (i) normal healthy people in the Sudan have high antibody titres of Salmonella typhi; (ii) the Widal test in the Sudan should be interpreted against this background; (iii) previous diagnostic titre of 1.160 for S. typhi results in high false positive results; (iv) a titre above 1.320 is suggested as diagnostic for S. typhi; 1.160 for both S. partyphi B and S. paratyphi A."

CD008892,0,20097760,0,The role of potassium in inflammasome activation by bacteria.,"Many Gram-negative bacteria possess a type III secretion system (TTSS( paragraph sign)) that can activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, process caspase-1 and lead to secretion of mature IL-1beta. This is dependent on the presence of intracellular flagellin. Previous reports have suggested that this activation is independent of extracellular K(+) and not accompanied by leakage of K(+) from the cell, in contrast to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, non-flagellated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to activate NLRC4, suggesting that formation of a pore in the cell membrane by the TTSS apparatus may be sufficient for inflammasome activation. Thus, we set out to determine if extracellular K(+) influenced P. aeruginosa inflammasome activation. We found that raising extracellular K(+) prevented TTSS NLRC4 activation by the non-flagellated P. aeruginosa strain PA103DeltaUDeltaT at concentrations above 90 mm, higher than those reported to inhibit NLRP3 activation. Infection was accompanied by efflux of K(+) from a minority of cells as determined using the K(+)-sensitive fluorophore PBFI, but no formation of a leaky pore. We obtained exactly the same results following infection with Salmonella typhimurium, previously described as independent of extracellular K(+). The inhibitory effect of raised extracellular K(+) on NLRC4 activation thus reflects a requirement for a decrease in intracellular K(+) for this inflammasome component as well as that described for NLRP3."
CD008892,0,24904229,0,Paratyphoid fever: splicing the global analyses.,"The incidence of enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A) is increasing in many parts of the world. Although there is no major outbreak of paratyphoid fever in recent years, S. Paratyphi A infection still remains a public health problem in many tropical countries. Therefore, surveillance studies play an important role in monitoring infections and the emergence of multidrug resistance, especially in endemic countries such as India, Nepal, Pakistan and China. In China, enteric fever was caused predominantly by S. Paratyphi A rather than by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). Sometimes, S. Paratyphi A infection can evolve into a carrier state which increases the risk of transmission for travellers. Hence, paratyphoid fever is usually classified as a ""travel-associated"" disease. To date, diagnosis of paratyphoid fever based on the clinical presentation is not satisfactory as it resembles other febrile illnesses, and could not be distinguished from S. Typhi infection. With the availability of Whole Genome Sequencing technology, the genomes of S. Paratyphi A could be studied in-depth and more specific targets for detection will be revealed. Hence, detection of S. Paratyphi A with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method appears to be a more reliable approach compared to the Widal test. On the other hand, due to increasing incidence of S. Paratyphi A infections worldwide, the need to produce a paratyphoid vaccine is essential and urgent. Hence various vaccine projects that involve clinical trials have been carried out. Overall, this review provides the insights of S. Paratyphi A, including the bacteriology, epidemiology, management and antibiotic susceptibility, diagnoses and vaccine development."

Ex vivo production of the cytokines was analyzed in a whole blood culture system with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Acute phase circulating concentrations of cytokines (+/- SD) were as follows: interleukin (IL)-1 beta, < 140 pg/mL; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), 130 +/- 50 pg/mL; IL-6, 96 +/- 131 pg/mL; and IL-8, 278 +/- 293 pg/mL. Circulating inhibitors were elevated in the acute phase: IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) was 2304 +/- 1427 pg/mL and soluble TNF receptors 55 and 75 were 4973 +/- 2644 pg/mL and 22,865 +/- 15,143 pg/mL, respectively. LPS-stimulated production of cytokines was lower during the acute phase than during convalescence (mean values: IL-1 beta, 2547 vs. 6576 pg/mL; TNF alpha, 2609 vs. 6338 pg/mL; IL-6, 2416 vs. 7713 pg/mL). LPS-stimulated production of IL-1RA was higher in the acute than during the convalescent phase (5608 vs. 3977 pg/mL).

Specific oligonucleotide probes are used to detect target DNA during the amplification, by hybridizing to the amplicons. These probes are linked to a fluorophore, which fluoresces only when hybridized to the target sequence. As part of an Emergency Response Validation due to a massive outbreak and subsequent recall, peanut butter was tested to compare the performance of iQ-Check Salmonella II to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Bacteriological Analytical Manual (FDA-BAM) reference method for detection of Salmonella. A single enrichment in buffered peptone water was used for a reduced enrichment time of 21 +/- 1 h over the 48 h reference method.

CD008892,0,11557508,0,EPEC-activated ERK1/2 participate in inflammatory response but not tight junction barrier disruption.,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) alters many functions of the host intestinal epithelia. Inflammation is initiated by activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and paracellular permeability is enhanced via a Ca2+- and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK)-dependent pathway. The aims of this study were to identify signaling pathways by which EPEC triggers inflammation and to determine whether these pathways parallel or diverge from those that alter permeability. EPEC-induced phosphorylation and degradation of the primary inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaBalpha) were tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta independent. In contrast to Salmonella typhimurium, EPEC-stimulated IkappaBalpha degradation and IL-8 expression did not require Ca2+. Instead, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 was significantly and rapidly activated. ERK1/2 inhibitors attenuated IkappaBalpha degradation and IL-8 expression. Although ERK1/2 can activate MLCK, its inhibition had no impact on EPEC disruption of the tight junction barrier. In conclusion, EPEC-induced inflammation 1) is TNF-alpha and IL-1beta receptor independent, 2) utilizes pathways differently from S. typhimurium, 3) requires ERK1/2, and 4) employs signals that are distinct from those that alter permeability. This is the first time that EPEC-activated signaling cascades have been linked to independent functional consequences."

This was a retrospective review of 21 confirmed cases over a 5-year period. Mean age was 32.6 years (range 2-60 years), and Mexico (7/21) and El Salvador (3/21) represented the most common countries of origin. Recent travel to an endemic area was noted in 14 patients. The most common complaints were fever (15/21), headache (10/21), abdominal pain (9/21), and diarrhea (6/21). Average duration of symptoms before presentation to the Emergency Department (ED) was 7.9 days. High fever associated with bradycardia was noted in 12 patients. Leukopenia was present in 7 patients. Blood culture was the most sensitive confirmatory test while the Widal test was positive in 7 out of 11 cases. Fever of unknown origin (12/21), followed by presumed typhoid fever (3/21) were the most common ED diagnoses.

The blood culture obtained on admission revealed Salmonella enterica subspecies houtenae. He received intravenous ceftriaxone therapy during his hospital stay and oral cefixime after discharge. Unfortunately, the same symptoms recurred 2 weeks after discontinuing cefixime and the culture from the aspirate of a skin nodule yielded the same microorganism again. He received intravenous ceftriaxone therapy after readmission and became afebrile 3 days later. However, focal seizure was noted on the 14th day of hospitalization. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple brain abscesses, and electroencephalogram showed epileptiform activity. The intravenous antimicrobial agents were continued for a total of 84 days and interferon-gamma was administered as adjunctive therapy. Finally, he recovered from brain abscesses without any neurologic sequel. It is suggested that an extended course of antimicrobial treatment is necessary for chronic granulomatous disease with pyogenic infection because of the defective intracellular killing ability."

In a single blood sample collected on admission to hospital, the sensitivity of the dipstick assay was 69.8% when compared with bone marrow culture and 86.5% when compared with blood culture. The specificity as calculated for the group of patients with suspected typhoid fever but a negative culture result was calculated to be 88.9%. Of 80 patients with febrile illnesses other than typhoid fever, reactivity was observed in only three patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever.

The aim was to determine which bacteriological method would support LC PCR for testing naturally contaminated poultry and red meat samples with Salmonella. Twenty three (50.0%) and 24 (52.2%) out of 46 chicken meat samples were positive for Salmonella by the FDA and ISO methods, respectively. Five of the 15 (33.3%) turkey meat samples were found to harbor Salmonella by both bacteriological methods. None of the red meat samples were positive for Salmonella using the FDA method. There was one red meat sample (3.3%) positive for Salmonella using ISO method. LC PCR results indicated that 23 (50.0%) and 31 (67.4%) of the DNA templates obtained from the 46 preenriched chicken meat FDA and ISO samples were positive for Salmonella. Salmonella detection rate from turkey meat samples by ISO LC PCR was 6.7%, whereas no detection was observed by FDA LC PCR. FDA LC PCR detection rate in red meat samples was 23.3%, whereas the ISO LC PCR was 43.3%. Relative accuracy rates of ISO LC PCR and FDA LC PCR were 67.4%, 60.0%, 53.3% and 56.5%, 66.7%, 76.7% for chicken, turkey, and red meats, respectively. We presume that the low relative accuracy problem, which can be related to the use of FDA and ISO preenrichments for template preparations in the PCRs, can be overcome by the use of primary enrichments of both FDA and ISO bacteriologies."

Splenectomy is the standard surgical treatment for these lesions. But these days, with improvements in imaging techniques, percutaneous drainage of splenic abscesses has been demonstrated to be one of the alternative treatment in selected cases. We report the case of a 7 year-old male, who presented with Salmonella typhi in blood and urine cultures, and a 1: 320 in O titer of Widal test. Ultrasound and computed tomography showed a single splenic abscess, 3 cm in diameter. He was treated with antibiotics, but the symptoms were not relieved. Thus we performed the percutaneous drainage of the splenic abscess under ultrasound guidance. A culture of the aspirated material was positive for Salmonella typhi, and the boy's condition improved. We think that percutaneous drainage of a single lesion was an excellent alternative to surgery, particularly because our patient was young and spleen conservation was desirable."
CD008892,0,3686631,0,Predicting enteric fever without bacteriological culture results.,"We used Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of enteric fever in 260 patients presenting with undiagnosed fever, without recourse to blood or stool culture results. These individuals were divided into 110 patients with enteric fever (63 culture positive, 47 culture negative) and 150 patients with other causes of fever. Comparison of the frequencies of occurrence of 19 clinical and laboratory events, said to be helpful in the diagnosis of enteric fever, in the two groups revealed that only 8 events were significantly more frequent in enteric fever. These were: a positive Widal test at a screening dilution of 1:40; a peak temperature greater than = 39 degrees C; previous treatment for the fever; a white blood cell count less than 9 X 10(6)/litre; a polymorphonuclear leucocyte count less than 3.5 X 10(6)/litre; splenomegaly; fever duration greater than 7 d; and hepatomegaly. When the probability of enteric fever was determined prospectively in 110 patients, using only 6 of these discriminating events, the probability of patients with a positive prediction having enteric fever (diagnostic specificity) was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.68 to 0.91) and the probability of those with a negative prediction not having enteric fever (diagnostic sensitivity) was 0.92 (0.85 to 0.99). Using all 19 events did not alter the diagnostic specificity or diagnostic sensitivity. This study shows that a small number of clinical and laboratory features can objectively discriminate enteric fever from other causes of fever in the majority of patients. Calculating the probability of enteric fever can aid in diagnosis, when culturing for salmonella is either unavailable or is negative."

Significant fall in titres was observed in 94 per cent patients of bacteriologically confirmed typhoid and 67 per cent patients in whom a diagnosis of typhoid was based only on a significant Widal test result. Patients of non-typhoid febrile illnesses showed either no fall or an insignificant fall in their titres. The detection of specific IgM antibodies by this simple modification of Widal test thus seems to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

Among 231 consecutive blood cultures showing GNB tested for Vi, and a subset of 163 tested for STO, by latex agglutination (LA), 125 and 32, respectively, were positive. The GNB in 127 blood cultures were confirmed by conventional methods as S. typhi, 125 (98.4%) of which had been identified by the Vi LA test. In the subset of 163, 81 grew S. typhi, of which only 32 (39.5%) had been identified by the STO LA tests. Thus, the sensitivity of the Vi and STO LA tests was 98.4% and 39.5%, respectively, whereas the specificity was 100% for both tests. Of the S. typhi isolates, 38 (30.4%) were detected by the Vi LA test on day 2 and 73 (58.4%) on day 3, day 1 being the date of inoculation of the blood culture broths.

Employing in vitro proliferation assays with T cells from S. enteritidis 11RX-primed (BALB/c x C57BL/6J)F1 mice as the measure of T cell stimulation, we have identified Ag able to stimulate T cells in the regions containing 16, 24, 34 and 50-60 kDa proteins, with dominant Ag activity at about 16 kDa. These results were confirmed with long-term, Ag-specific L3T4+ T cell lines which responded to molecules in the same four Mr regions, suggesting that no selection by a single antigenic determinant had occurred during more than 3 months of in vitro culture, or that all the molecules which were stimulatory shared at least one antigenic determinant. Because the seven clones we examined responded only to 16 kDa molecules, the former alternative is the more likely. Standard immunoblot analysis indicated that these Ag also act as major B cell stimulating determinants. T cells of BALB/c mice, which are 5-10 times more resistant to S. enteritidis 11RX than C57BL/6J mice, showed the same pattern of reactivity as F1 mice whereas the major antigenic region for T cells of C57BL/6J mice was located between 50 and 60 kDa."

To overcome the problem of cross reactivity specific epitope of the flagellar H antigen was immobilised on the testing kit strip eliminating chances of cross reactivity and false positive results thereby increasing the specificity of the test. Since the immunodiagnostic kit, uses the flagellar H antigen from bacteria present in our country, the antibodies present in the serum of patients of our country will have maximum binding affinity, enhancing the sensitivity of our test kit.

Although fluoroquinolone resistance is mediated by genomic DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) as well as plasmid DNA, the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) facilitates higher level resistance by interacting with genomic mechanism and is capable of horizontal spread."

Of 14 patients whose medical records were available, the age range was between 2 years and 15 years with a male to female ratio of 1.8:1. Major presentations were prolonged fever with a mean duration of 7 days and gastrointestinal manifestations including abdominal pain (71%), hepatomegaly (64%), anorexia (57%), vomiting (57%), and diarrhea (50%). Most cases had normal hematocrit values with white blood cell counts of 5,000-9,000 cells/mm3 and the percentage of neutrophils was 60-89. Complications were abnormal urine sediments (3) including a case of typhoid nephritis, severe enteritis (2) and acute hemolysis (1). Most isolates were susceptible to cotrimoxazole, ampicillin and ceftriaxone by the disk diffusion susceptibility test. Defervescence was seen within 3-14 days after antibiotic therapy.

The epidemiological profile of these isolates was established according to the biochemical and serological characterizations, the antibiotic susceptibility patterns (disk diffusion method) to betalactams and aminoglycosides. 127 isolates of Salmonella spp were from stools and 22 from blood cultures. The main serotypes were S. ser. Wien (108 isolates) and S. ser. Typhimurium (21). A sample of 50 isolates was selected among the different resistance phenotypes for determination of MICs and betalactamase identification by isolelectro-focusing (36 isolates). All of them were resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin but variable for cephaloridine. Since 1986 appeared the resistance to cefotaxime and in 1990 all the S. ser. Wien isolates were resistant to the 4 betalactams tested including cefotaxime associated to streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin. All of them had a high level of resistance to amoxicillin and gentamicin (mean MICs > 2048 and > 512 mg/l). The mean MIC of cefotaxime was 43.2 mg/l for S. ser. Wien, 64mg/l for S. ser. Typhimurium and decreased to 1.9 and 0.12 mg/l in combination with 1 mg/l of clavulanic acid. The beta-lactam resistance was mediated to enzymatic mechanism, at first the betalactamase of TEM-1 type alone, then associated to extended-spectrum betalactamase, mainly type SHV-2 since 1986, and other new types in 1990. They were under the control of plasmids with different sizes."

CD008892,0,20392916,0,Typhoid in Kenya is associated with a dominant multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi haplotype that is also widespread in Southeast Asia.,"In sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, remains largely unknown, in part because of a lack of blood or bone marrow culture facilities. We characterized a total of 323 S. Typhi isolates from outbreaks in Kenya over the period 1988 to 2008 for antimicrobial susceptibilities and phylogenetic relationships using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. There was a dramatic increase in the number and percentage of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Typhi isolates over the study period. Overall, only 54 (16.7%) S. Typhi isolates were fully sensitive, while the majority, 195 (60.4%), were multiply resistant to most commonly available drugs-ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole; 74 (22.9%) isolates were resistant to a single antimicrobial, usually ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, or tetracycline. Resistance to these antibiotics was encoded on self-transferrable IncHI1 plasmids of the ST6 sequence type. Of the 94 representative S. Typhi isolates selected for genome-wide haplotype analysis, sensitive isolates fell into several phylogenetically different groups, whereas MDR isolates all belonged to a single haplotype, H58, associated with MDR and decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility, which is also dominant in many parts of Southeast Asia. Derivatives of the same S. Typhi lineage, H58, are responsible for multidrug resistance in Kenya and parts of Southeast Asia, suggesting intercontinental spread of a single MDR clone. Given the emergence of this aggressive MDR haplotype, careful selection and monitoring of antibiotic usage will be required in Kenya, and potentially other regions of sub-Saharan Africa."
CD008892,0,8326516,1,Rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever by co-agglutination in an Indian hospital.,"Detection of Salmonella typhi infection by a co-agglutination assay for specific O, H and Vi antigens and by blood culture were compared for 110 patients with suspected typhoid fever. Blood cultures were positive for S. typhi in 25.5% of patients. Co-agglutination tests with patients' serum and with blood culture supernates gave positive results in 70.9% and 67.3% of cases respectively. S. typhi antigens Hd and O9 were detected in patients' serum by co-agglutination in 96.4% of blood culture-positive, and 62.2% of blood culture-negative patients. Co-agglutination results were uniformly negative with serum samples from a control group of 50 healthy individuals, 20 patients with febrile non-typhoid infectious disease and 20 patients with non-infectious febrile disease. Of the 25 patients with suspected typhoid fever who had not received prior antibiotic treatment, 88% yielded positive blood cultures and 96% gave positive results in serum co-agglutination tests. By contrast, of the 85 patients who had received prior antibiotics, only 7% yielded positive blood cultures, but 63.5% gave positive results in serum co-agglutination tests. Co-agglutination tests with serum offer a simple, rapid, sensitive, specific and economical method for the early diagnosis of typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,18626466,0,Typhoid Fever.,"Typhoid fever is one of the most common febrile illnesses encountered by the physicians in Bangladesh. Diagnosis is not difficult but has lately become a challenge due to changed clinical pattern of the disease, lack of adequate facilities for blood, stool, urine culture, excessive reliance on nonspecific Widal test and non availability of any reliable rapid diagnostic tests. Further, the indiscriminate and injudicious use of antibiotics for treating fever in undiagnosed febrile illnesses early has created problems to the physicians to reach to a diagnosis later on. This has also led to the emergence of high level resistance to many of the commonly used antibiotics in our country. Ciprofloxacin is often used empirically for treating the disease though there is already a high level resistance. In case the organism is in-vitro sensitive to ciprofloxacin but resistant to nalidixic acid, a much higher dose of drug is required to maintain the MIC which is 10 times higher than usual. Third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefixime) are still the effective drugs for treating typhoid fever. The drug needs to be used in proper dose and duration to prevent emergence of resistance. Azithromycin though advocated by many as an alternative to ciprofloxacin in resistant cases, has recently lost its credibility due to emergence of resistance. We should not rely on Widal test in diagnosing typhoid fever. In a suspected case, the patient should not be prescribed any antibiotic without sending blood sample for culture sensitivity."

Nineteen patients received 3 g ceftriaxone iv once daily for three days. Twenty patients received 4 g ceftriaxone iv once daily for three days and 20 patients received oral chloramphenicol 3 g daily in divided doses for two days followed by 2 g daily for 12 days. Eighteen patients were cured (95%) with 3 g of ceftriaxone for three days. All patients receiving 4 g ceftriaxone per day for three days or chloramphenicol for 14 days were cured. In the ceftriaxone groups two patients developed typhoid fever 30 and 45 days respectively after completion of treatment and one further patient had evidence of reinfection. Three patients relapsed within 15 to 17 days in the chloramphenicol group. Fever subsided in most patients between six and eight days, with three patients having a prolonged and moderate fever for 11 days in the ceftriaxone groups. This study suggests that a short treatment of three days of typhoid fever with ceftriaxone (3 or 4 g once daily) is adequate and not hazardous as far as relapses are concerned."

More than 67% of S.typhi and 80% of S.paratyphi A isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol. Sensitivity of S.typhi isolates to cephalosporins was found to have increased from 2001-2004 while that of S.paratyphi A showed a decline. With increasing resistance to ciprofloxacin and the possibility of re-emergence of sensitivity to chloramphenicol, the policy of empirical treatment of enteric fever needs to be rationalized."

The broader aim of this study is to find out whether such hypersensitivity also occurs in patients suffering from bacterial infections. The capacity of stimulated peripheral blood cells from infected, intensive-care patients to produce cytokines (IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) was compared to that of healthy donors. Culturing of the cells was carried out preferentially in whole blood diluted 1:3. Whole blood cultures (WBC) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whole killed Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus and concanavalin A (ConA), and the cytokine production was determined. Two main findings emerged from this study: The IFN-gamma production by WBC of patients was, compared to healthy donors, markedly suppressed, regardless of stimulus used. Further, patients' WBC exhibited a suppressed TNF-alpha production after stimulation with LPS. Surprisingly, following stimulation with bacteria (S. typhimurium and S. aureus) an elevated TNF-alpha and IL-6 response was obtained. Thus, in severely infected patients the cytokine responses of peripheral blood cells to LPS may be suppressed, while the response to other bacterial components is enhanced."

However, conventional blood culturing is slow in isolating bacteria causing these diseases. In this work, we evaluated the performance of blood clot culture and conventional whole blood cultures in the accurate diagnosis of enteric fever (253 cases) and human brucellosis (71cases). The blood clot culture was found to be much more sensitive for both Salmonella (more by 34.4%, P< 0.001) and Brucella (more by 22.6%, P<0.001) than whole blood culture. Bacterial growth was significantly faster in cultures of blood clot compared to whole blood (1.1 versus 2.6 days for Salmonella, 3.1 versus 8.2 days for Brucella melitensis, respectively). The rapid confirmation of the etiological agent would facilitate an early institution of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, thereby reducing clinical morbidity especially in an endemic population.

CD008892,0,11862006,0,Utility of PCR in diagnosis of problematic cases of typhoid.,"Typhoid is a global problem. Conventional diagnostic methods have limitations. The Widal test gives a high proportion of false positive results, and indiscriminate use of antibiotics has reduced the utility of blood culture. Consequently, these procedures are inadequate for diagnosing suspected cases of typhoid that do not present clear-cut symptoms. We previously showed that PCR-based diagnosis of typhoid targeting the flagellin gene has unparalleled specificity. We assessed the utility of this method for diagnosis of problematic cases of typhoid. A comparative study of PCR, blood culture, and Widal test was carried out on 55 cases of suspected typhoid with fever for 3-30 days and possessing an ambiguous clinical picture. A control group comprised of 20 healthy persons was also included. The respective positive results by PCR, blood culture, and Widal test for these groups were 58.2 and 0%, 14.5 and 0%, and 52.7 and 45%. Sensitivity of PCR as compared with that of blood culture was significantly better. We concluded that PCR is much superior to conventional methods and, due to its high sensitivity and specificity, can be of great use for rapid and definitive diagnosis of problematic cases of typhoid."

The cerebrospinal fluid showed a reactive pleocytosis. Initially, no acute inflammatory changes were present on serum and blood analysis, although the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was moderately increased to 25/60 mm. Pyrexia of up to 38.5 degrees C developed 6 days after admission. Because Borrelia IgM and IgG titres were positive, the diagnosis was at first thought to be atypical borreliosis and the patient was treated with antibiotics. However, after a further episode of fever. Salmonella antibody titres, which had initially been normal, rose to 1: 3200 (Salmonella typhi O and H antigens) and 1: 12800 (Salmonella enteritidis, H antigen). At this stage, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate rose to 86/120 mm and the C-reactive protein to 77 mg/dl. The white cell count remained normal throughout. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis. Abnormalities on bone scintigraphy were confirmed by CT and MRI scans, showing spondylodiscitis of lumbar vertebrae 1 and 2 with limited osteolysis. The lesion resolved completely on 6 week's treatment with ciprofloxacin (200 mg twice a day intravenously) and conservative supportive treatment. Spondylodiscitis is an uncommon complication of salmonellosis and may occur long after the diarrhoea. Cross reactions with Borrelia flagellin antigens may lead to the wrong diagnosis being made."

The main symptoms are intense headache, chills and fever and an irritating non-productive cough. Later most patients develop signs of pneumonitis most clearly seen on radiographic examination. An important clue to the diagnosis is a history of contact with birds, most often budgerigars and more recently cockatiels. The diagnosis may be confirmed by the isolation of Chlamydia psittaci, the causative organism, but more usually reliance is placed on the results of serological tests revealing the development of chlamydial antibodies. None of the patients in this series developed serious complications, but if not treated psittacosis sufferers may develop severe pneumonitis, hepatitis and gastro-enteritis; the mortality rate is up to 20%. A rare but fatal complication is chlamydial endocarditis, presenting with the signs and symptoms of subacute bacterial endocarditis, but giving repeated negative blood cultures. The illness responds specifically to treatment with tetracycline antibiotics within 48 hours. Chlamydial infections are widespread among avian species. In the RSA most cases of psittacosis have resulted from contact with budgerigars and cockatiels, but outbreaks have been associated with imported batches of birds including South American parrots and Australian finches, emphasizing the need for vigilance at seaports."
CD008892,0,8723730,0,Characterization of microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the oxidation of xenobiotic chemicals in human fetal liver and adult lungs.,"Levels and catalytic activities of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes involved in the oxidation of drugs and carcinogens were determined in human adult lungs and fetal livers and compared with those in microsomes from adult livers. P450s immunoreactive with anti-human P4501A1 and anti-human P4503A antibodies were detected in fetal liver microsomes by immunoblotting analysis, and P450s related P4501A1, 2A6, 2C9, 2E1, and 3A4 were determined in adult lung microsomes; all of these P450 enzymes were detected in much higher amounts in adult liver microsomes except that P4501A2 was only the 1A subfamily of P450 found in adult livers. Drug oxidation activities with the substrates ethoxyresorufin, coumarin, 7-ethoxycoumarin, bufuralol, and testosterone were determined in these microsomes, and we found that none of the activities were higher in microsomes of adult lungs and fetal livers than in adult livers. Activation of procarcinogens to reactive metabolites that induce umu gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 or NM2009 was also examined and it was found that activities with (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of 7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene were higher in fetal liver microsomes than adult lung or liver microsomes. The adult liver and lung activities for these two procarcinogens were similar on the basis of microsomal protein contents despite the fact that p450 contents are higher in liver than lung microsomes. alpha-Naphthoflavone, a known inhibitor of P4501A-related activities, did not affect these procarcinogen activation in fetal liver microsomes. Fetal liver microsomes catalyzed activation of aflatoxin B1 and sterigmatocystin, two procarcinogens known to be activated by P4503A4/7 in humans, although activation of carcinogenic arylamines that are good substrates for P4501A2 was much lower in microsomes of fetal livers and adult lungs than in adult livers. These results suggest that in human fetal livers at least two P450 enzymes, a form of P450 that is immunoreactive P4501A1 and P4503A7, are actually expressed and these enzymes are suggested as being involved in the activation of the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of 7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene and the carcinogenic mycotoxins, respectively. The exact nature of the former enzyme in fetal livers is unknown. In adult human lungs, several P450 enzymes are expressed, although the precise roles of these enzymes in the oxidation of xenobiotics were not determined due to the low level of expression of these P450s."

Unlike MDR strains, the isolation rate (approximately 3.3%) of susceptible S. Typhi remained remarkably unchanged during the study. The significant decrease in isolation of MDR strains suggests that cheaper and effective first-line antibiotics may re-emerge as drugs of choice for the treatment of typhoid fever in Bangladesh."
CD008892,0,9047363,0,Structural requirements for the formation of 1-methylguanosine in vivo in tRNA(Pro)GGG of Salmonella typhimurium.,"Maturation of tRNA and rRNA and the assembly of the ribosome in all organisms occurs in vivo in a complex pathway in which various proteins such as endo- and exonucleases, tRNA and rRNA modifying enzymes and ribosomal proteins, act concomitantly and temporarily during the maturation process. One class of RNA binding proteins are the tRNA modifying enzymes, which catalyse the formation of various modified nucleosides present in tRNA. Here we analyse the consequences of various alterations in a tRNA on the formation of modified nucleosides in the tRNA and the aminoacylation of it under true in vivo conditions, i.e. in a cell with normal amounts of the tRNA substrate and the tRNA binding protein. We have devised a selection method to obtain mutants of tRNA(Pro)GGG in Salmonella typhimurium that may no longer be a substrate inl vivo for the tRNA(m1G37)methyltransferase. These mutant tRNAs were purified from cells in balanced growth by a solid phase hybridisation technique and the presence of 1-methylguanosine (m1G) in position 37 next to the anticodon was monitored. Of 13 different mutant tRNA(Pro)GGG species analysed, eight of them had a drastically reduced level of m1G. Some of these mutant tRNA species had alterations far from the nucleotide G37 modified by the enzyme; e.g. base-pair disruptions in the first, fourth and eighth (last) base-pair of the acceptor stem, in the D-stem, and in the top of the anticodon stem. The structure of all the mutant tRNA(Pro)GGG species must deviate from the wild-type form, since they all induced +1 frameshifting. Still, tRNA(Pro)GGG from five of the mutants had normal levels of m1G. Thus, only a subset of mutations, all inducing an altered tRNA structure, resulted in m1G deficiency. However, those alterations in tRNA(Pro)GGG, which influenced the tRNA(m1G37)methyltransferase activity, did not affect in vivo the formation of four other modified nucleosides and the aminoacylation of tRNA(Pro)GGG, demonstrating the extreme dependence of the tRNA(m1G37)methyltransferase on an almost perfect three-dimensional structure of the tRNA. We discuss that the conformation of the anticodon loop may be a major determining element for the formation of m1G37 in vivo."
CD008892,0,19183274,0,"Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium Std fimbriae bind terminal alpha(1,2)fucose residues in the cecal mucosa.","The std operon encodes a fimbrial adhesin of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium that is required for attachment to intestinal epithelial cells and for cecal colonization in the mouse. To study the mechanism by which this virulence factor contributes to colonization we characterized its binding specificity. Std-mediated binding to human colonic epithelial (Caco-2) cells could be abrogated by removing N-linked glycans. Adherence of Std fimbriated S. Typhimurium to Caco-2 cells could be blocked by co-incubation with H type 2 oligosaccharide (Fucalpha1-2Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) or by pretreatment of cells with alpha1-2 fucosidase. In contrast, pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with neuraminidase or co-incubation with the type 2 disaccharide precursor (Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) did not reduce adherence of Std fimbriated S. Typhimurium. Binding of purified Std fimbriae to Fucalpha1-2Galbeta1-4GlcNAc in a solid phase binding assay was competitively inhibited by Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), a lectin specific for Fucalpha1-2 moieties. Purified Std fimbriae and UEA both bound to a receptor localized in the mucus layer of the murine cecum. These data suggest that the std operon encodes an adhesin that binds an alpha1-2 fucosylated receptor(s) present in the cecal mucosa."

CD008892,0,11169102,0,Actin is ADP-ribosylated by the Salmonella enterica virulence-associated protein SpvB.,"The Salmonella enterica virulence-associated protein SpvB was recently shown to contain a carboxy-terminal mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase domain. We demonstrate here that the catalytic domain of SpvB as well bacterial extracts containing full-length SpvB modifies a 43 kDa protein from macrophage-like J774-A.1 and epithelial MDCK cells as shown by label transfer from [32P]-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to the 43 kDa protein. When analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the same protein was modified in cells infected with S. enterica serovariant Dublin strain SH9325, whereas infection with an isogenic spvB mutant strain did not result in modification. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments using SH9325-infected cells identified the modified protein as actin. The isolated catalytic domain of SpvB mediated transfer of 32P from [32P]-NAD to actins from various sources in vitro, whereas isolated eukaryotic control proteins or bacterial proteins were not modified. In an in vitro actin polymerization assay, the isolated catalytic SpvB domain prevented the conversion of G actin into F actin. Microscopic examination of MDCK cells infected with SH9325 revealed morphological changes and loss of filamentous actin content, whereas cells infected with the spvB mutant remained virtually unaffected. We conclude that actin is a target for an SpvB-mediated modification, most probably ADP-ribosylation, and that the modification of G actin interferes with actin polymerization."
CD008892,0,387612,0,Radioimmunoassay for Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide O antigens: influence of antigen solubility.,"We have developed a solid-phase radioimmunoassay technique for specific gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigens. The method exploits the high-titer, specific immunoglobulin M response of the rabbit to LPS immunization to measure as little as 5 ng of homologous LPS per ml with less than 0.5% cross-reactivity toward heterologous LPS or culture supernatants. We found that O antigen in complete LPS was less available for antibody binding than O antigen in the soluble polysaccharide derived by mild acid hydrolysis of LPS and that triethylamine-induced disaggregation of complete LPS increased its activity in the assay. Quantitation of O antigen with the assay was thus influenced by the physical state of LPS or ""free"" O antigen."
CD008892,0,873122,0,Reassessment of the Widal test in the diagnosis of typhoid.,"The Widal test was done in 100 nontyphoidal febrile pients, 53 patients with proven typhoid, and in 61 patients with immunological disturbances in an are where typhoid is endemic. Salmonella typhi H or O agglutinin titers of 1:160 or more were seen in only 1% of nontyphoidal fevers. Using these criteria, the Widal test was of diagnostic value in 50 of 53 (94.3%) of patients with typhoid. The Widal test was positive in 85.7% of patients even in the first week of the illness, possibly owing to the hyperimmune state of the patients. A false-positive test was found in 11.5% of patients with major immunological disturbances in whom the Widal test must therefore be interpreted with caution."

In this study, it was found that 71% typhoid fever cases were less than 30 years of age group with male to female ratio of 3:1. Fever over 5 days followed by headache and chills were major presenting symptoms. Widal test and blood culture for Salmonella typhi were positive in 59% and 49% cases respectively. Two third of our study population had total leucocyte count of normal range. The fever clearance time was significantly better with ofloxacin compared to ciprofloxacin (p < 0.05) and ceftriaxone compared to chloramphenicol (p < 0.05). The release from treatment was significantly shorter with ceftriaxone compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol (p < 0.01). Ceftriaxone was found to be 100% sensitive to salmonella typhi. Amoxicillin was only 52.1% sensitive to Salmonella typhi. Early diagnosis and institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy is of paramount importance in the management of typhoid patients."
CD008892,0,7080181,0,Cell mediated and humoral immune responses in human typhoid fever.,"The leucocyte migration inhibition test (LMIT) and the Widal test have been used to investigate the cell mediated (CMIR) and humoral immune responses (HIR) in 43 typhoid patients in comparison with the responses in 83 control subjects in two groups (65 normal persons and 18 sewerage workers) who were occupationally exposed to human faeces. The patients and the sewerage workers showed significantly higher CMIR than the normal persons. The O, H, and Vi antibody titres were significantly higher in the patients than in both control groups. Neither the CMIR nor the antibody titres differed significantly between the adult and paediatric patients. While we confirm that a CMIR does develop in typhoid patients, we found no correlation between the CMIR and the occurrence of complications. Neither the duration of the illness (after the first week) nor chloramphenicol therapy affected the CMIR or the HIR."
CD008892,0,19169891,0,Detection of living Salmonella cells using bioluminescence.,"ATP-based bioluminescence using mutant firefly luciferase was combined with an immunochromatographic lateral flow test strip assay for Salmonella enteritidis detection. In this combination method, the Salmonella-antibody-gold complex captured at the test line on the test strip was lysed by heat-treatment, and the ATP released from the cells was measured using mutant luciferase. This method resulted in approximately 1,000 times higher sensitivity in the detection of Salmonella (i.e. 10(3) c.f.u./ml) compared to immunochromatographic lateral flow assay."
CD008892,0,2796443,0,[Acute enteritis caused by Salmonella: effect of mecillinam and cotrimoxazole on the clinical course and fecal carrier state].,"In a prospective randomized study we have evaluated the influence of co-trimoxazole and mecillinam on the clinical outcome and the fecal Salmonella sp carrier status in 134 adult patients with acute non-typhi Salmonella sp enteritis. The patients were distributed in three groups on the basis of predefined clinical and biological criteria, depending on their risk of bacteremia or severe complications of it, or on the enteroinvasive character of the causative organism. The inclusion in any group determined the treatment. Seventy-six patients received mecillinam (1.200 mg/day p.o.), 36 co-trimoxazole (1.600 mg/day p.o.), both during five days, and 22 only diet. The patients were investigated after 1, 3 and 6 weeks until stool culture was negative. The isolated Salmonella strains, either in stool or blood culture, had a sensitivity of 98.3% to mecillinam and 96.9% to cotrimoxazole. Resistance did not develop during therapy. All patients had a favorable outcome, including the six with bacteremia. No differences were found regarding clinical features (diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever) or the rate of positive stool cultures in the three therapeutic groups in any of the follow-up controls. It was concluded that the administration of mecillinam or co-trimoxazole to patients with Salmonella sp enteritis is not associated with a prolongation of the state of fecal carrier or with the development of resistant strains."

CD008892,0,1712981,0,Pancreatic disturbances and typhoid fever.,"During an 8-year period, 14 adult patients were hospitalized with typhoid fever confirmed by positive blood cultures for Salmonella typhi. Among these patients, we have retrospectively (n = 7) and prospectively (n = 7) evaluated pancreatic disturbance by serum amylase and lipase measurements at the time of admission. In 7 (50%) biological signs of pancreatitis were noted: mean amylase level 81 IU (range 30-201 IU, normal value less than 40 IU), mean lipase level 949 IU (range 468-2,000 IU, normal value less than 300 IU). Clinical signs of pancreatitis were observed in 4 cases, one of whom had a concomitant salmonella biliary tract infection and gall stones demonstrated by laparotomy and the others a normal biliary ultrasonographic examination with a swelling of the pancreas. No alcohol or drug use or other infection were noted before admission. This study suggests that biological or clinical pancreatitis should be considered as a frequent complication of typhoid fever. S. typhi should therefore be added to the list of pathogens implicated in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic or non-lithiasic pancreatitis."
CD008892,0,24218407,1,Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of a typhoid IgM flow assay for the diagnosis of typhoid fever in Cambodian children using a Bayesian latent class model assuming an imperfect gold standard.,"Rapid diagnostic tests are needed for typhoid fever (TF) diagnosis in febrile children in endemic areas. Five hundred children admitted to the hospital in Cambodia between 2009 and 2010 with documented fever (≥ 38°C) were investigated using blood cultures (BCs), Salmonella Typhi/Paratyphi A real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), and a Typhoid immunoglobulin M flow assay (IgMFA). Test performance was determined by conventional methods and Bayesian latent class modeling. There were 32 cases of TF (10 BC- and PCR-positive cases, 14 BC-positive and PCR-negative cases, and 8 BC-negative and PCR-positive cases). IgMFA sensitivity was 59.4% (95% confidence interval = 41-76), and specificity was 97.8% (95% confidence interval = 96-99). The model estimate sensitivity for BC was 81.0% (95% credible interval = 54-99). The model estimate sensitivity for PCR was 37.8% (95% credible interval = 26-55), with a specificity of 98.2% (95% credible interval = 97-99). The model estimate sensitivity for IgMFA (≥ 2+) was 77.9% (95% credible interval = 58-90), with a specificity of 97.5% (95% credible interval = 95-100). The model estimates of IgMFA sensitivity and specificity were comparable with BCs and better than estimates using conventional analysis."
CD008892,0,26004722,0,Effect of different doses of Manuka honey in experimentally induced mouse typhoid.,"Typhoid fever is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Data from World Health Organization (WHO) shows that 21 million cases of typhoid occur globally every year and over 200,000 die each year; most of them at a very young age. The situation in Pakistan is similar. Typhi and other typhoidal salmonellae have developed resistance to chloramphenicol and other first line anti-typhoid. There is a rapid increase in multi-drug resistance (MDR) throughout the world. There is an urgent need to find out alternative medicine to sort out this problem. This study was conducted to establish preventive as well as therapeutic potential of Manuka honey. A total of eighty pathogen free BALB/C mice between 8 weeks to 12 weeks of age, weighing 25-30 grams were taken and divided into 4 groups. Group A, B and C were infected through oral route with 10(8) colony forming unit (CFU) of Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 to produce typhoid like disease in mice. Group A, which comprised of 20 mice was further divided in A1 and A2 given Manuka honey at a dose of 15ml/kg and 20 ml/kg respectively. Group B, which comprised of 20 mice was further divided in B1 and B2 was given Manuka honey at dose of 20ml/kg and 25ml/kg respectively. Clinical features of mouse typhoid, like body temperature, respiratory rate, number of stools and general behavior were recorded twice daily. Blood cultures of mice in different groups were taken at different days to evaluate the establishment of infection as well as to observe the therapeutic and preventive potential of Manuka honey in mouse typhoid. Fisher's Exact, Chi- Square and t-test were used to analyze the data. Significant association was observed in the ultimate fate of mice in Group A1 and Group A2 (P<0.001), showing that from a total of 20 mice in both groups, 10 mice fall in Group A1 of which 10 (100%) developed infection as it was not prevented by honey at a dose of 15ml/kg body weight (15.00±0.00) in Group A1 and ten mice fall in Group A2 of which 10(100%) did not developed an infection as it was prevented by honey at a dose of 20ml/kg body weight (20.00±0.00) in Group A2. Significant association was observed in the ultimate fate of mice in Group B1 and Group B2 (P<0.001) showing that from a total of 20 mice in both groups, 10 mice fall in Group B1 of which 10 (100%) had an infection, which was not treated by honey at a dose of 20 ml/kg body weight. Ten mice fall in Group B2 of which 10 (100%) had an infection, which was treated by honey at a dose of 25 ml/kg body weight (25.00±0.00). Results of the present study suggest that Manuka honey (UMF25±) has a potent anti-typhoid activity in vivo as well. There is an intense need for a carefully designed clinical trial in which this therapeutic potential of Manuka honey should be further evaluated. There is also need for the search of local honeys comparable to Manuka honey as a therapeutic option for typhoid fever."

Reports of colonoscopic appearance and intervention of typhoid perforation involve only few cases. This series reports the colonoscopic findings and the role of colonoscopic hemostatic interventions in controlling the bleeding ileocolonic lesions. During the typhoid fever outbreak in Sulaymaniyah City in Iraqi Kurdistan Region, we received 52 patients with LGIB manifesting as fresh bleeding per rectum or melena. We performed total colonoscopy with ileal intubation for all cases. The findings were recorded and endoscopic hemostatic intervention with adrenaline-saline injection and argon plasma coagulation was applied to actively bleeding lesion. These patients were young, 11-30 years of age, with female preponderance. Blood culture was positive in 50 %. Colonoscopic findings were mostly located in the ileocecal region, although other areas of the colon were involved in many cases. Twenty-four percent of the cases required endoscopic hemostatic intervention by adrenaline injection with argon plasma coagulation which was effective in all patients except one who died in spite of surgical intervention in addition of endoscopic hemostasis. Dual endoscopic hemostatic intervention can be a safe and effective management option for patients with LGIB due to typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,2768450,0,Immunoblot detection of class-specific humoral immune response to outer membrane proteins isolated from Salmonella typhi in humans with typhoid fever.,"The studies reported here were undertaken to assess the ability of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Salmonella typhi to induce a humoral immune response in humans with typhoid fever. OMPs were isolated with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and were found to be contaminated with approximately 4% lipopolysaccharide. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns showed protein bands with molecular size ranges from 17 to 70 kilodaltons; the major groups of proteins were those that correspond to the porins and OmpA of gram-negative bacteria. Rabbit antiserum to OMPs or to S. typhi recognized OMPs after absorption with lipopolysaccharide. Sera from patients with typhoid fever contained immunoglobulin M antibodies which reacted with a protein of 28 kilodaltons and immunoglobulin G antibodies which reacted mainly with the porins, as determined by immunoblotting. These results indicate that the porins are the major immunogenic OMPs from S. typhi and that the immune response induced in the infection could be related to the protective status."

Specimens used were serum and urine obtained from normal healthy individuals and from patients with typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, pyrexia caused by other bacteria and pyrexia with negative haemoculture. The ELISA for antigenuria gave a significantly higher sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and positive predictive value than the Widal test (p less than 0.05). The ELISA for antigenaemia gave a significantly higher sensitivity and positive predictive value only. All other values were not significantly different. The timing of specimen collection was critical for sensitivity in the ELISA for antigenaemia and antigenuria, and the best results could be obtained by carrying out both assays simultaneously. The clearance of BP from serum into urine occurred around 16 days after the onset of fever in one patient. In two patients, BP could be detected in sera up to 3 weeks after the onset of fever. In two patients, serum BP could still be detected although haemoculture was negative."

The authors summarize the clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic aspects of these patients. Fever, usually higher than 39 degrees C, was the hallmark of the disease. Other manifestations of typhoid, although relatively frequent, are presented as part of a mild nonspecific symptom complex, often found only in the prodromal period. An elevated level of serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (mean, 81 IU/ml) was the most characteristic laboratory abnormality, occurring in 94% of the patients. Blood cultures were positive in 46 of the 50 patients (92%), and were not affected by prior outpatient antibiotic therapy. The first blood culture was diagnostic in 93% of the cases. Although fever tended to disappear more rapidly among patients receiving ampicillin than among those treated with chloramphenicol, results of therapy were similar in both groups. Nevertheless, the relapse rate of 36% among 25 chloramphenicol-treated patients was significantly higher than the 9% noted among 22 patients treated with ampicillin.

CD008892,0,10206117,0,Rapid and reliable serological diagnosis of enteric fever: comparative sensitivity and specificity of Typhidot and Typhidot-M tests in febrile Malaysian children.,"The Typhidot test, which detects IgM and IgG antibodies to a Salmonella typhi-specific outer membrane protein, is as sensitive as, and more specific than, the Widal test in the diagnosis of enteric fever in Malaysian children. It is easier and quicker to perform. In order to increase diagnostic accuracy in an area of high endemicity, the Typhidot-M test has been developed in which IgG is first removed. This theoretically allows improved detection of IgM, and thus would differentiate new from recent infections. We evaluated both tests in 134 unselected febrile children admitted to the General Hospital Kota Bharu, Malaysia. The children were divided into two groups: (i) those who were blood and/or stool culture positive for S. typhi and/or who had clinical features strongly suggestive of enteric fever (n = 62); and (ii) those who were both culture-negative and had clinical evidence of another diagnosis (n = 72). The sensitivity and specificity of the Typhidot and Typhidot-M tests were identical at 90.3 and 93.1%, respectively. Both tests had comparable sensitivity but greater specificity than those of the Widal test (91.9 and 80.6%, respectively). When used together, a positive result for Typhidot and/or Typhidot-M was more specific than either test alone (95.2%) but specificity was lower (87.5%). We conclude that the Typhidot and Typhidot-M tests have comparatively high diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that IgM can be detected in children who may have a predominant IgG response to S. typhi. Using these tests in combination increases the negative predictive value but at the cost of a lower positive predictive value."

Specifically, we employed an anti-Salmonella lipopolysaccharide O12 monoclonal antibody in an epitope-inhibition 10-min test (TUBEX TP) to detect O12⁺Salmonella organisms directly from routine blood culture broths. The aim is to obviate the need to subculture the broth and subsequently identify the colonies. Thus, blood from 78 young outpatients suspected of having enteric fever was incubated in an enrichment broth, and after 2 or 4 days, broth samplings were examined by TUBEX TP as well as by conventional agar culture and identification. TUBEX TP was performed before the culture results. Eighteen isolates of S. Typhi (15 after 2 days) and 10 isolates of S. Paratyphi A (4 after 2 days) were obtained by conventional culture. Both these Salmonella serotypes, the main causes of enteric fever, share the O12 antigen. In all instances where either of these organisms was present (cultured), TUBEX TP was positive (score 4 [light blue]--to--score 10 [dark blue]; negative is 0 [pink-colored]) i.e. 100% sensitive. Identification of the specific Salmonella serotype in TUBEX-positive cases was achieved subsequently by conventional slide agglutination using appropriate polyclonal antisera against the various serotypes. Twelve Escherichia coli, 1 Alcaligenes spp. and 1 Enterobacter spp. were isolated. All of these cases, including all the 36 culture-negative broths, were TUBEX-negative i.e. TUBEX TP was 100% specific. In a separate study using known laboratory strains, TUBEX TF, which detects S. Typhi but not S. Paratyphi A via the O9 antigen, was found to efficiently complement TUBEX TP as a differential test. Thus, TUBEX TP and TUBEX TF are useful adjuncts to conventional culture because they can save considerable time (>2 days), costs and manpower."
CD008892,0,9879967,0,"SERE, a widely dispersed bacterial repetitive DNA element.","The presence of a Salmonella serotype Enteritidis repeat element (SERE) located within the upstream regulatory region of the sefABCD operon encoding fimbrial proteins is reported. DNA dot-blot hybridisation analyses and computerised searches of genetic databases indicate that SERE is well conserved and widely distributed throughout the bacterial and archaeal kingdoms. A SERE-based polymerase chain reaction (SERE-PCR) assay was developed to fingerprint 54 isolates of Enteritidis representing nine distinct phage types and 54 isolates of other Salmonella serotypes. SERE-PCR identified five distinct fingerprint profiles among the 54 Enteritidis isolates; no correlation between phage types and SERE-PCR fingerprint patterns was noticed. SERE-PCR was reproducible, rapid and easy to perform. The results of this investigation suggest that the limited heterogeneity of SERE-PCR fingerprint patterns can be utilised to develop serotype- and serogroup-specific fingerprint patterns for isolates of Enteritidis."

Polyvalent antibodies to S typhi were demonstrated in 28/30 (93%) typhoid patients, 0/11 bacteremic patients (E coli or S paratyphi A) and 0/15 asymptomatic individuals. Widal test showed significant anti-0 agglutinin values (> = 1: 160) in only 12/30 (40%), 1/11 (9%) and 0/15 subjects from each group respectively. Typhoid patients tested on admission or at discharge showed similar high reactivity rates to ELISA. On the contrary, the Widal test detected only 2/15 (13%) patients on admission (p < 0.02) and 10/15 (67%) at discharge. These results and additional immunoblotting tests suggest that ELISA developed to detect polyvalent anti-LPS antibodies could represent a highly specific diagnostic tool to confirm typhoid fever in endemic areas."

Reduced flagellin-specific antibodies were detected either systemically or locally following delivery of flagellated derivatives of aroA Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin SL1438 via the nasal route, the most effective mucosal site for activation of immune responses in mice. In contrast, flagellin represents the most potent Salmonella antigen for the generation of specific serum antibody (IgG) responses following i.p. inoculations. The distinct immunogenic properties of Salmonella flagellin could not be ascribed to deficient colonization, reduced invasive ability or loss of the flagellin expression by the flagellated vaccine strains."

Unfortunately fever and leukocytosis persisted despite treatment. Blood cultures obtained on admission grew Salmonella enteritidis. Subsequently he developed increasing back pain and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) was performed, demonstrating a complex ulcer at the aortic arch with multiple small mobile strandlike densities suggestive of vegetation. Contrast thoracic CT scan confirmed an ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque which progressively increasing in size over 3 months despite antibiotics. Therefore, a stent was deployed in view of high risk of perforation and he was placed on prolonged antibiotics. Post-stenting CT scan a few months later showed a patent stent with the aneurysm remained stable in size. Cardiovascular infections develop in approximately 25 % of patients with Salmonella bacteremia. Most patients with Salmonella aortitis have preexisting atherosclerosis at the site of the subsequently infected aneurysm. The diagnosis of S. aortitis can be challenging, because the clinical course may be indolent and the symptoms are nonspecific.

A total of 88 blood culture-confirmed patients were enrolled in the study (86 with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and 2 with S. enterica serovar Paratyphi A). Of these, 44 received azithromycin and 44 ofloxacin. A total of 68 of 87 (78%) isolates were MDR serovar Typhi, and 46 of 87 (53%) were nalidixic acid resistant. The MIC(90) (range) of azithromycin was 8 (4 to 16) microgram/ml for the isolates.

However, all the isolates were sensitive to fluquinolones and cephalosporins. Molecular analysis demonstrated that all MDR strains possessed a single large transferable 98 MDal plasmid. On conjugation, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance was transferred from MDR strains to E coli K-12. Restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA showed similar digest profiles of all 5 selected donors and their transconjugants. This trend of increasing resistant strains of S typhi, especially by the transferable plasmid is of major public health concern."

Thirty-four and 28 patients received 500 mg and 750 mg respectively. Strains of Salmonella typhi resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole were isolated from the blood of 27 patients (43.5%). No resistance to ciprofloxacin was encountered.

All patients were cured, although one patient in the 750 mg group experienced a presumed relapse two months following completion of therapy. Ciprofloxacin administered for 7-10 days was adequate treatment for 57 of the 62 patients (92%); only five patients required therapy for more than 10 days. Patients with pretreatment symptoms of > or = 10 days duration defervesced in a mean of 5.7 +/- 2.3 days compared with 4.5 +/- 1.3 days (P = 0.01) for those with symptoms of shorter duration.

CD008892,0,8844793,0,Mutagenic activity and heterocyclic amine content of the human diet.,"The mutagenic activity and the mass amount of heterocyclic amines responsible for the mutagenic activity have been measured in some cooked foods. Cooked meats are the predominant source of mutagenic activity in the diet with values ranging from 0 to 10,000 revertants per gram reported in the Ames/Salmonella test with strain TA98. Several heterocyclic amines are present and have been quantified using solid-phase extraction followed by HPLC. Frying at higher temperatures and for longer times produces the greatest mutagenic response, and concomitantly, the largest amounts of heterocyclic amines. Most of the mutagenic activity in fried meat samples can be accounted for by MeIQx(2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-b]quinoxaline), DiMeIQx (2-amino-3,4,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline) and IQ (2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoline), although other heterocyclic amines are present and PhIP (2-amino-3-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) mutagenic activity becomes significant at higher temperatures. Non-meat products such as baked breads can also form significant mutagenic activity, particularly when overcooked. Commercially prepared hamburgers made from meat substitutes such as tofu, wheat gluten or tempeh and fried at 210 degrees C have up to 10% of the mutagenic activity of a fried beef patty cooked under the same conditions. When detected, amounts of heterocyclic amines in fried beef patties range from a total of 0.35 ng/g for commercial beef hamburgers to 142 ng/g for a beef patty cooked over a barbecue. Dietary intake is expected to have a large range, from less than one microgram per day to over 50 micrograms per day based on current knowledge of known heterocyclic amine chemicals and heterocyclic amine-containing foods."

The strip test based on the principle of sandwich immunoassay by the specific binding of antigens from S. typhi O901 and antibody of S. typhi O901 on a nitrocellulose membrane. Antibody-gold nanoparticle conjugate was used as the label and was coated onto a glass fiber membrane, which was used as a conjugate pad. To create a test and control zone, antibody of S. typhi O901 and an anti-IgG were dotted on the nitrocellulose membrane, respectively. Positive samples were displayed as red dots at the test and control zones of the nitrocellulose membrane, while negative samples resulted in a red dot only in the control zone. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 1.14×10(5) cfu mL(-1), which could be visually detected by the naked eye within 15 min. This strip test provided a lower detection limit and analysis time than a dot blot immunoassay (8.88×10(6) cfu mL(-1) for LOD and 110 min for reaction time). In addition, our immunochromatographic strip test was employed to detect S. typhi in human serum effectively, with high accuracy.

Three of five isolates from blood, both isolates from CSF and urine and only two of fifteen isolates from faeces were positive for fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loop. All these strains produced an enterotoxic principle, antigenically related to cholera coli family of enterotoxins, as detected by latex agglutination and immuno-dot-blot tests. Polymyxin-B treated 6 h cultures yielded the best toxin. All 5 blood isolates, both CSF isolates and one of the two urine isolates showed low LD50 indicating high virulence. The study thus revealed that some strains of S. typhimurium are more virulent and produce more enterotoxins. These strains invade the intestinal mucosa potently and lead to extra-intestinal manifestations. The low virulent strains, on the other hand, are confined to the intestine and cause mild/moderate gastroenteritis. Enzyme assays were done in 5 representative strains of good, moderate and low toxin producers. Catalase and superoxide dismutase assays did not show any correlation with toxin production, thus suggesting that the enzyme production is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of the virulence for S. typhimurium."
CD008892,0,8748032,0,Salmonella typhimurium secreted invasion determinants are homologous to Shigella Ipa proteins.,"Salmonella typhimurium secreted proteins (Ssp) were previously implicated in epithelial cell invasion. Here we describe four genes (SspB, sspC, sspD, and sspA), located between spaT and prgH, which encode proteins of 63, 42, 36, and 87 kDa, respectively. These Ssp are homologous to Shigella flexneri secreted proteins IpaB, IpaC, IpaD and IpaA. A non-invasive mutant with a transposon insertion in sspC lacks Ssp of 87, 42 and 36 kDa. Complementation and analyses show that sspC and sspD encode the 42 and the 36 kDa Ssp, while the 87 kDa Ssp is encoded by sspA. sspC and sspD, but not sspA, are required for invasion. Amino-terminal sequencing shows that SspC and SspA are secreted without amino-terminal processing. We further demonstrate that Ssp secretion requires proteins encoded by prgHIJK, homologous to the Shigella Ipa secretion system, since SspA is abundantly secreted by wild-type bacteria but is completely retained within the cellular fraction of a prgHIJK mutant. A precipitate containing abundant SspC and three other major Ssp of 63, 59 and 22 kDa was isolated from culture supernatants of wild-type bacteria. These data indicate that major secreted invasion determinants of S. typhimurium are structurally and functionally homolgous to S. flexneri Ipa proteins."

Mutagenicity was determined by the Salmonella plate incorporation assay with the tester strain TA98 and activity is related either to the weight of aerosol (rev mg-1) or to the volume of atmospheric sample (rev m-3). The fumes emitted from the tyre tread line, calender feeding, and tyre vulcanizing processes, showed the highest mutagenic activity (55-211 rev mg-1, + S9). At these and at other workplaces (extruder mill, carbon black station, mixer loading), mutagenic activity related to the volume of air was in the range of 22-158 rev m-3, + S9. The results indicate the need to reduce and monitor mutagenic contamination in order to increase the safety of work in the rubber industry."

In a recent publication [Tanamoto K-I, Azumi S. Salmonella-type heptaacylated lipid A is inactive and acts as an antagonist of lipopolysaccharide action on human line cells. J Immunol 2000; 164: 3149-3156] the corresponding synthetic hepta-acyl lipid A (compound 516) was reported to be agonistically inactive but to rather suppress pro-inflammatory activation by the endotoxic hexa-acyl lipid A (LA(hexa), compound 506) and S-form LPS from Escherichia coli in the human macrophage-like cell lines THP-1 and U937. These results, however, were in contrast to previous findings with human mononuclear cells (hMNC) isolated from peripheral blood, in which compound 516 was found to be an agonist, expressing low, but significant, cytokine-inducing activity as compared to LA(hexa). We have investigated the structure of natural LA(hepta) from the S. enterica sv. Minnesota Re deep rough mutant strain (R595) by TLC immunoblot, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Using these techniques, the structural identity between LA(hepta) and the synthetic compound 516 was confirmed. In corroboration of previous findings with studies employing compound 516, purified LA(hepta) was found to induce the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 in hMNC, thus displaying moderate agonistic activity. Furthermore, we showed that LA(hepta) agonistically activated nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in THP-1 cells, thus clearly ruling out the possibility that LA(hepta) is an antagonist and that its biological activity is influenced by the type of human myeloid cells used for testing endotoxicity (hMNC versus THP-1 cells)."

CD008892,0,16476168,0,Antibiogram pattern and seasonality of Salmonella serotypes in a North Indian tertiary care hospital.,"The antibiogram pattern and seasonal distribution of Salmonella serotypes were analysed retrospectively over a 6-year period from January 1999 to December 2004. Blood cultures received in the Bacteriology Laboratory were processed by standard procedures and the Salmonella spp. isolates were identified with specific antisera and standard biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by a standard disc diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for 332 representative Salmonella isolates was determined by E test. Salmonella Typhi (75.7%) was the predominant serotype among 830 Salmonella spp. isolated during the study period followed by S. Paratyphi A (23.8%). The maximum number of enteric fever cases occurred during April-June (dry season) followed by July-September (monsoon season). There was a decrease in multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Typhi, but MDR S. Paratyphi A isolates increased. There was also a dramatic increase in nalidixic acid-resistant isolates. All isolates were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin except one S. Typhi strain which demonstrated high-level ciprofloxacin resistance with a MIC of 16 mug/ml. A knowledge of the seasonal distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of Salmonella in a particular geographical region is helpful in the delineation of appropriate control measures required for prevention of enteric fever."
CD008892,0,8728876,0,[-Prolonged fever syndrome and infection of abdominal aortic aneurysm due to Salmonella enteritidis].,"Endovascular infection of atherosclerotic aorta is a rare event in the setting of aged patients with gram negative bacteremia of the salmonella group. Until the beginning of the 60s this meant an ominous diagnosis with an almost unavoidable fatal prognosis. Presently, this trend has been reverted, mostly due to an earlier diagnosis, the development of more sophisticated imaging techniques, the correct use of broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotics and prompt surgical management. Paradoxically, the incidence of arterial infections has increased in recent years, specially in old people with atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysms, in whom infective endocarditis could not be demonstrated. We describe the case of a 65 year old man, with a history of longstanding non-insulin-dependent diabetes, presenting with protracted fever, weight loss and thigh pain. Blood cultures and serologic studies as well as several echocardiograms yielded negative results. An abdominal CT scan showed an infrarenal aortic aneurysm raising the clinical suspicion of arterial infection of abdominal aorta. The patient underwent surgery because of highly presumptive diagnosis of complicated aortic aneurysm. The resection was followed by an in situ graft. There was no evidence of disruption or gross collection. Samples of the aortic wall and perianeurysmatic fluid grew Salmonella enteritides. We describe the main etiopathogenic and clinic features of the entity highlighting the high sensitivity and specificity of the CT scan in the identification and characterization of infected aortic aneurysm. Certain features may firmly suggest this diagnosis without using preoperative aortography."

CD008892,0,9666004,1,One-step 2-minute test to detect typhoid-specific antibodies based on particle separation in tubes.,"Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi. Detection of anti-S. typhi antibodies in the patient is a useful diagnostic aid. Among the various methods developed over the years for this purpose, the Widal test, based on bacterial agglutination, has remained the most widely used, even though it is neither specific nor sensitive. Its popularity stems from the fact that it is simple to use and inexpensive. We describe a new test which also uses a simple one-step procedure but is more rapid and accurate than the Widal. The new test (TUBEX) detects anti-Salmonella O9 (both immunoglobulin M [IgM] and IgG) antibodies in patients by inhibiting the binding between an anti-O9 IgM monoclonal antibody (MAb) conjugated to colored latex particles and S. typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) conjugated to magnetic latex particles. The reactants are mixed in a specially designed microtube for 2 min, and the result is read based on the resultant color of the supernatant following forced sedimentation of the magnetic beads. In the absence of inhibitory antibodies, there is a color change (from blue to red) due to cosedimentation of the indicator particles with the magnetic particles, whereas if these antibodies are present, they prevent such a change to a degree dependent on their concentration. Preliminary examination of TUBEX using the anti-O9 MAb and irrelevant MAbs as inhibitors revealed the test to be specific and reproducible, with an analytical sensitivity of 16 micrograms per ml of antibody. The reagents remained stable for at least 9 months when kept at 4 degrees C. In the examination of 16 stored sera obtained from 14 patients with proven cases of typhoid fever and 78 serum samples from 75 subjects without typhoid fever, TUBEX was found to be 100% sensitive and 100% specific. The nontyphoid group comprised 26 healthy blood donors, 30 antinuclear antibody (ANA)-negative patients, 9 ANA-positive patients, of whom 1 was positive for anti-DNA antibody, 4 typhus patients, and 6 septicemic patients. In addition, the sera obtained from 11 patients clinically diagnosed as having typhoid fever were all positive in the test. The TUBEX results correlated to some extent, albeit insignificantly (r = 0.38, P = 0.07), with those of an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) which used a similar detection format (inhibition) and reagents (S. typhi LPS and anti-O9 antibody). TUBEX correlated very well with ELISAs which detected anti-S. typhi LPS IgM (r = 0.58, P = 0.003) or IgG (r = 0.54, P = 0.006) antibodies from the typhoid patients. There was no correlation with the Widal test. The TUBEX test, if performed on slides (instead of tubes) or with soluble antigen (instead of antigen-conjugated magnetic beads), suffered significantly in sensitivity. Direct agglutination tests using LPS-conjugated indicator particles performed either on slides or in microwells also failed to detect antibodies from the majority of typhoid patients. Thus, TUBEX appears to be well designed and well suited for use in the laboratory or by the bedside as a simple, rapid aid to the routine diagnosis of typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,1723073,0,Immunoblot studies to analyze antibody to the Rickettsia typhi group antigen in sera from patients with acute febrile cerebrovasculitis.,"In 1986, an unusual syndrome of acute febrile cerebrovasculitis in the Piedmont Region of Virginia was reported. All patients had encephalopathy and prior exposure to both a sylvan environment and flea-infested animals. The initial serological studies suggested a rickettsial origin, corroborating clinical, epidemiological, and histopathological findings. Sera from four of five patients were subsequently studied by immunoblotting. Unabsorbed and absorbed sera were tested with electrophoresed and electroblotted Rickettsia typhi, Legionella bozemanii, and Proteus vulgaris OX19 antigens. The unabsorbed sera reacted with all three antigens. The P. vulgaris- and L. bozemanii-absorbed sera reacted with R. typhi only and without significantly less intensity. In contrast, the reactivity of R. typhi-absorbed sera was significantly lower with all three antigens. These results indicate that these patients had specific antibodies to a typhus group antigen. Although our findings suggest that a rickettsia of the typhus group may have caused this syndrome, no definitive diagnosis could be achieved because a rickettsial organism was not isolated."

The results of the coagglutination tests were compared to the results from standard cultural isolation and identification. Bone marrow aspirates (356) were cultured in oxgall medium and aliquots subcultured daily for 7 days while simultaneously testing for the presence of Salmonella group D and Vi antigens using coagglutination (COAG). S. typhi was isolated from 220 (62%) of the cultures and the D- and Vi-COAG tests were positive for those same cultures. The COAG test was also negative for 6 cultures containing S. paratyphi A. The COAG results were available within 10 minutes after 18 to 24 hours incubation of the primary cultures whereas the isolation and confirmed identification took 2 to 3 days longer. The COAG test is valuable as an aid to rapidly identify S. typhi in bone marrow-oxgall cultures."

CD008892,0,686246,0,Diagnostic value of the Widal test in areas endemic for typhoid fever.,"The usefulness of a single Widal test to diagnose typhoid fever in endemic areas was investigated. Reciprocal Salmonella typhi O and H titers greater than or equal to 40 and greater than or equal to 80, respectively, occurred in approximately 90% of 42 Mexican patients with bacteriologically-confirmed typhoid fever at the time of presentation to hospital and, by day 4 to 5 of clinical illness, in 70% of U.S. adult volunteers who developed typhoid fever in the course of vaccine efficacy trials but in only 0.7% (O) to 3% (H) of 275 healthy individuals from a non-endemic area. Healthy Peruvians from areas endemic for typhoid fever commonly had antibody which was age-related. Peak prevalence was found in 15- to 19-yr-olds in whom 29% had O titers greater than or equal to 40 and 76% had H titers greater than or equal to 80. A single Widal test in an unvaccinated individual showing elevated O and H titers is strongly suggestive of typhoid fever if the person comes from a non-endemic area or is a child less than 10 yr of age in an endemic area. Because of the high prevalence of antibody amongst healthy invididuals over 10 yr of age in endemic, areas, a single Widal test offers virtually no diagnostic assistance in adolescents and adults."

Among 421 isolates, 248 were fully OFX-sensitive showing MICs of 0.0125-0.075 microg/ml and inhibitory zone diameters of > or =24 mm. The remaining 173 isolates (MICs of 0.5-1.5 microg/ml) that were treated with OFX did not respond to the therapy. However, 169 (97.69%) of the 173 isolates were determined to be susceptible (zone diameter > or =16 mm) by the disc diffusion method, whereas only 3 were intermediately susceptible (zone diameter 13-15 mm) and the final isolate showed OFX-resistance (zone diameter 12 mm). Thus, following the NCCLS guidelines, OFX-resistance in S. enterica serovar Typhi was not detected by the disc diffusion test. The present data suggest a revision of the NCCLS breakpoints in selecting OFX as the preferred treatment regimen for S. enterica serovar Typhi"
CD008892,0,19767428,0,Thioredoxin 1 participates in the activity of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenicity island 2 type III secretion system.,"The facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium relies on its Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system (T3SS) for intracellular replication and virulence. We report that the oxidoreductase thioredoxin 1 (TrxA) and SPI2 are coinduced for expression under in vitro conditions that mimic an intravacuolar environment, that TrxA is needed for proper SPI2 activity under these conditions, and that TrxA is indispensable for SPI2 activity in both phagocytic and epithelial cells. Infection experiments in mice demonstrated that SPI2 strongly contributed to virulence in a TrxA-proficient background whereas SPI2 did not affect virulence in a trxA mutant. Complementation analyses using wild-type trxA or a genetically engineered trxA coding for noncatalytic TrxA showed that the catalytic activity of TrxA is essential for SPI2 activity in phagocytic cells whereas a noncatalytic variant of TrxA partially sustained SPI2 activity in epithelial cells and virulence in mice. These results show that TrxA is needed for the intracellular induction of SPI2 and provide new insights into the functional integration between catalytic and noncatalytic activities of TrxA and a bacterial T3SS in different settings of intracellular infections."
CD008892,0,19767429,0,"A protein important for antimicrobial peptide resistance, YdeI/OmdA, is in the periplasm and interacts with OmpD/NmpC.","Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) kill or prevent the growth of microbes. AMPs are made by virtually all single and multicellular organisms and are encountered by bacteria in diverse environments, including within a host. Bacteria use sensor-kinase systems to respond to AMPs or damage caused by AMPs. Salmonella enterica deploys at least three different sensor-kinase systems to modify gene expression in the presence of AMPs: PhoP-PhoQ, PmrA-PmrB, and RcsB-RcsC-RcsD. The ydeI gene is regulated by the RcsB-RcsC-RcsD pathway and encodes a 14-kDa predicted oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding-fold (OB-fold) protein important for polymyxin B resistance in broth and also for virulence in mice. We report here that ydeI is additionally regulated by the PhoP-PhoQ and PmrA-PmrB sensor-kinase systems, which confer resistance to cationic AMPs by modifying lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ydeI, however, is not important for known LPS modifications. Two independent biochemical methods found that YdeI copurifies with OmpD/NmpC, a member of the trimeric beta-barrel outer membrane general porin family. Genetic analysis indicates that ompD contributes to polymyxin B resistance, and both ydeI and ompD are important for resistance to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, a mouse AMP produced by multiple cell types and expressed in the gut. YdeI localizes to the periplasm, where it could interact with OmpD. A second predicted periplasmic OB-fold protein, YgiW, and OmpF, another general porin, also contribute to polymyxin B resistance. Collectively, the data suggest that periplasmic OB-fold proteins can interact with porins to increase bacterial resistance to AMPs."
CD008892,0,16670774,0,Mannan-binding lectin activates C3 and the alternative complement pathway without involvement of C2.,"Lectin pathway activation of C3 is known to involve target recognition by mannan-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins and generation of classical pathway C3 convertase via cleavage of C4 and C2 by MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2). We investigated C3 activation in C2-deficient human sera and in sera with other defined defects of complement to assess other mechanisms through which MBL might recruit complement. The capacity of serum to support C3 deposition was examined by ELISA using microtiter plates coated with O antigen-specific oligosaccharides derived from Salmonella typhimurium, S. thompson, and S. enteritidis corresponding to serogroups B, C, and D (BO, CO, and DO). MBL bound to CO, but not to BO and DO, and efficiently supported C3 deposition in the absence of C2, C4, or MASP-2. The existence of an MBL-dependent C2 bypass mechanism for alternative pathway-mediated C3 activation was clearly demonstrated using CO, solid-phase mannan, and E. coli LPS. MASP-1 might contribute, but was not required for C3 deposition in the model used. Independent of MBL, specific antibodies to CO supported C3 deposition through classical and alternative pathways. MBL-dependent C2 bypass activation could be particularly important in various inherited and acquired complement deficiency states."
CD008892,0,15691138,1,Comparison of the diagnostic value of local Widal slide test with imported Widal slide test.,"A laboratory study comparing the Widal slide agglutination test using local antigens produced by Mekar Jaya Diagnostica (SAT-MJD) with imported antigens (Murex, Abbott) was carried out on 55 sera of typhoid fever patients with positive blood culture and 56 sera of non-typhoid febrile patients. The SAT-MJD antigens consisted of a mixture of 5 different phage-types of S. typhi dominantly found in Indonesia. This study revealed the following results: the diagnostic sensitivity of local and imported antigens was 83.93%, the diagnostic specificity of local antigens was higher than the imported antigens ie 82.14% compared with 64.28%, the diagnostic efficiency of local antigens was 82.88% compared with 73.87% of the imported antigens. The diagnostic positive and negative predictive values of the local antigens were 80.70% and 83.63%, respectively. The imported antigen revealed diagnostic positive and negative predictive values of 69.69% and 80%, respectively. The diagnostic specificity and efficiency of local antigens were significantly different (p < 0.02 and p < 0.05) from the imported antigens. The local antigens have some advantages. There was no variation in within-run and between-day test, compared with a 6.6% variation shown by the imported antigen. The test results obtained 5 minutes after mixing the serum with antigens reduced the possibility of false-positive and false-negative results. The cost of local antigens is lower than the imported antigens. Based on these data, the Widal SAT-MJD has a reliable diagnostic value and can be used in small laboratories, such as primary health centers (Puskesmas)."
CD008892,0,9657991,0,The apeE gene of Salmonella typhimurium encodes an outer membrane esterase not present in Escherichia coli.,"Salmonella typhimurium apeR mutations lead to overproduction of an outer membrane-associated N-acetyl phenylalanine beta-naphthyl ester-cleaving esterase that is encoded by the apeE gene (P. Collin-Osdoby and C. G. Miller, Mol. Gen. Genet. 243:674-680, 1994). This paper reports the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the S. typhimurium apeE gene as well as some properties of the esterase that it encodes. The predicted product of apeE is a 69.9-kDa protein which is processed to a 67-kDa species by removal of a signal peptide. The predicted amino acid sequence of ApeE indicates that it is a member of the GDSL family of serine esterases/lipases. It is most similar to a lipase excreted by the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. The Salmonella esterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of a variety of fatty acid naphthyl esters and of C6 to C16 fatty acid p-nitrophenyl esters but will not hydrolyze peptide bonds. A rapid diagnostic test reported to be useful in distinguishing Salmonella spp. from related organisms makes use of the ability of Salmonella to hydrolyze the chromogenic ester substrate methyl umbelliferyl caprylate. We report that the apeE gene product is the enzyme in Salmonella uniquely responsible for the hydrolysis of this substrate. Southern blot analysis indicates that Escherichia coli K-12 does not contain a close analog of apeE, and it appears that the apeE gene is contained in a region of DNA present in Salmonella but not in E. coli."
CD008892,0,18245288,0,Coordinated regulation of expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 and flagellar type III secretion systems by ATP-dependent ClpXP protease.,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium delivers a variety of proteins via the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1)-encoded type III secretion system into host cells, where they elicit several physiological changes, including bacterial invasion, macrophage apoptosis, and enteropathogenesis. Once Salmonella has established a systemic infection, excess macrophage apoptosis would be detrimental to the pathogen, as it utilizes macrophages as vectors for systemic dissemination throughout the host. Therefore, SPI1 expression must be restricted to one or a few specific locations in the host. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the expression of this complex of genes is repressed by the ATP-dependent ClpXP protease, which therefore suppresses macrophage apoptosis. Depletion of ClpXP caused significant increases in the amounts of two SPI1-encoded transcriptional regulators, HilC and HilD, leading to the stimulation of hilA induction and therefore activation of SPI1 expression. Our evidence shows that ClpXP regulates cellular levels of HilC and HilD via the control of flagellar gene expression. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the flagellum-related gene product FliZ controls HilD posttranscriptionally, and this in turn activates HilC. These findings suggest that the ClpXP protease coregulates SPI1-related virulence phenotypes and motility. ClpXP is a member of the stress protein family induced in bacteria exposed to hostile environments such as macrophages."

To reduce the problem, SE bacterin in poultry farms has been applied. We previously demonstrated that a subunit antigen, g.m. part polypeptide in SE-Fli C (SEp 9), could be a candidate subunit antigen of SE vaccine which may show less side effects in chickens. In this study, we used SEp 9 along with an adjuvant to inoculate chickens, then the chickens were orally challenged with SE, and suppression of the SE count in the cecum was investigated. Chickens inoculated with a commercial SE vaccine were prepared as positive controls (vaccine group), and those with physiological saline (control group) for comparison of the bacterial count after challenge. Employing two types of antibody-detection ELISA coated with either de-flagellated SE or SEp 9, specific antibody levels in blood and the intestine were determined. The bacterial count was significantly lower 1 and 3 weeks after challenge in the SEp 9 than in the control group. Specific antibody only against SEp 9 in blood but not the intestine of these birds in the SEp 9 group was detected. This study confirmed that SEp 9 antigen is a major effective antigen in SE inactivated vaccine, and it is suggested that only the subunit vaccine antigen SEp 9 is needed to effectively suppress colonization in the chicken intestine, without the need for other SE component antigens."

Clinical case notes were retrieved and reviewed in 64 (68.8%) of them. Fifteen (23%) of the 64 children were less than one year of age while 22 (34%) were under the age of five years. The commonest presenting symptoms were fever, anorexia, diarrhoea and vomiting. A febrile convulsion was the presenting symptom in 13 (20%) of the patients, all of whom were under the age of five years. Hepatomegaly was almost twice as frequently observed as splenomegaly. Intestinal perforation was present in five of the patients. There was a high proportion of SS children who presented with fever, pallor, jaundice, generalized aches and pains and other clinical features of sickle cell disease and it is possible that such children are specially susceptible to typhoid fever. A clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever on admission was made in only 14 of the 64 children. Reasons are given for the low index of suspicion and it is suggested that any child with unremitting fever after adequate anti-malarial chemotherapy should be treated for enteric fever."

CD008892,0,537488,0,[Typhoid fever in Vietnam. I. Bacteriological study (607 Salmonella strains isolated from 1961 to 1975 at the Grall Hospital of Saigon)].,"From 1961 to 1975, researches on salmonellosis have been carried out in Hospital Grall, in Saigon, mainly during two periods (1961-1964, then 1971-1975). 607 strains of Salmonella have been isolated for these 15 years (558 S. typhi and 49 Salmonella, among several other serotypes). As typhoid fever is most important, the authors have studied this disease very carefully. The most efficacious technique of isolating is hemoculture. With coproculture, the results are disappointing. Scarcely, some strains have been found in samples of various origins. Indirect diagnosis methods are less interesting. They may induce only a presumptive diagnosis. S. typhi is always predominant : 86,5 p. 100 from 1961 to 1964 and 96,1 p. 100 from 1972 to 1975. Diffusion of this germ during the second period is linked to the occurring of resistance to chloramphenicol. Some other serotypes are observed scarcely. The lysotypes have been determined for almost all the strains (202, then 323, during the two phases of this study). From 172 to 1975, 24 different lysotypes have been found. Lysotype I + IV is predominant (59 p. 100), but the incidence of D 6 and of 46 (6,8 p. 100) is somewhat high, if it is compared to the others. Lysotype 46 has been observed only since 1971. It has been spreading up to now in South East Asia. Stretching of this lysotype, out of its original focus, is an important epidemiological character. In 1972, resistance of S. typhi to chloramphenicol appeared and it has been increasing mostly during the following years. From 1972 to 1975, 211 strains on 288 were found resistant (highest point in 1975 : 85,4 p. 100). It was a multiresistance to 4 antibiotics (antibiotype : CTSSu). This pehnomenon of plasmidic resistance was investigated in Institut Pasteur (Paris). Many lysotypes have been involved in resistance (14 among 24). Clinical study has been realized for 189 patients. During the typical period of the disease, fever is the major symptom. More scarcely, other clinical features are observed. Various complications have been related. The evolution of the disease has been generally satisfactory, as far as mortality (less than 2 p. 100), sequelae (1 p. 100) and relapses (2 p. 100) are concerned. Clinical course has not been modified by resistance of the germs."
CD008892,0,2204415,0,Importance of minor-groove contacts for recognition of DNA by the binding domain of Hin recombinase.,"Incorporation of the DNA-cleaving moiety EDTA.Fe at discrete amino acid residues along a DNA-binding protein allows the positions of these residues relative to DNA bases, and hence the organization of the folded protein, to be mapped by high-resolution gel electrophoresis. A 52-residue protein, based on the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of Hin recombinase (139-190), with EDTA at the NH2 terminus cleaves DNA at Hin recombination sites. The cleavage data for EDTA-Hin(139-190) reveal that the NH2 terminus of Hin(139-190) is bound in the minor groove of DNA near the symmetry axis of Hin-binding sites [Sluka, J. P., Horvath, S. J., Bruist, M. F., Simon, M. I., & Dervan, P. B. (1987) Science 238, 1129]. Six proteins, varying in length from 49 to 60 residues and corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of Hin recombinase, were synthesized by solid-phase methods: Hin(142-190), Hin(141-190), Hin(140-190), Hin(139-190), Hin(135-190), and Hin(131-190) were prepared with and without EDTA at the NH2 termini in order to test the relative importance of the residues Gly139-Arg140-Pro141-Arg142, located near the minor groove, for sequence-specific recognition at five imperfectly conserved 12-base-pair binding sites. Footprinting and affinity cleaving reveal that deletion of Gly139 results in a protein with affinity and specificity similar to those of Hin(139-190) but that deletion of Gly139-Arg140 affords a protein with altered affinities and sequence specificities for the five binding sites. It appears that Arg140 in the DNA-binding domain of Hin is important for recognition of the 5'-AAA-3' sequence in the minor groove of DNA. Our results indicate modular DNA and protein interactions with two adjacent DNA sites (major and minor grooves, respectively) bound on the same face of the helix by two separate parts of the protein."

Volunteers were distributed at random into 3 groups, 1 of which received 1 dose of typhoid vaccine and a second 2 doses; the third, a control group, received tetanus toxoid. The population was vaccinated in 1966 and was studied until the end of 1973. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the vaccine was based on cases of typhoid fever that were confirmed by positive blood cultures. Morbidity rates in the 3 groups indicated that the acetone-dried vaccine used was effective and that a single dose of vaccine gave reasonable protection for a short period, but that 2 doses gave greater and longer protection. The results of this trial are compared with those of earlier field and laboratory studies."

Clinical implications.,"This study is a review of 1,040 significant positive blood cultures from 415 patients, and 44 positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 44 patients treated at the Meir General Hospital during the period 1976-78. The most frequent isolates from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most frequent isolates from cerebrospinal fluid cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis, which were present in similar proportions. E. coli was predominant in the division of medicine, Staph. aureus in the division of pediatrics and Klebsiella in the division of surgery. Fifty percent of the E. coli isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and carbenicillin; about 80%, to cephalothin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; and 100%, to gentamicin. Only 7% of the Klebsiella isolates were sensitive to apicillin; 72% were sensitive to cephalothin and 87%, to gentamicin. Only 18% of Staph. aureus isolates were sensitive to penicillin, but about 95% were sensitive to methicillin or cephalothin. Two of 10 salmonellae isolates and 13% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin."
CD008892,0,23100346,1,Evaluation of a simple blood culture amplification and antigen detection method for diagnosis of Salmonella enterica serovar typhi bacteremia.,"In most areas where typhoid is endemic, laboratory diagnosis is not possible due to the lack of appropriate facilities. We investigated whether the combination of blood culture amplification of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi with an S. Typhi antigen rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could be an accurate and inexpensive tool for the accelerated diagnosis of patients with acute typhoid in Laos. For a panel of 23 Gram-negative reference pathogens, the Standard Diagnostics (catalog no. 15FK20; Kyonggi-do, South Korea) RDT gave positive results for S. Typhi NCTC 8385, S. Typhi NCTC 786 (Vi negative), Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (ATCC 13076), and Salmonella enterica serovar Ndolo NCTC 8700 (all group D). In a prospective study of 6,456 blood culture bottles from 3,028 patients over 15 months, 392 blood culture bottles (6.1%) from 221 (7.3%) patients had Gram-negative rods (GNRs) seen in the blood culture fluid. The sensitivity, negative predictive value, specificity, and positive predictive value were 96.7%, 99.5%, 97.9%, and 87.9%, respectively, for patients with proven S. Typhi bacteremia and 91.2%, 98.4%, 98.9%, and 93.9% for patients with group D Salmonella. The median (range) number of days between diagnosis by RDT and reference assays was 1 (-1 to +2) day for those with confirmed S. Typhi. The use of antigen-based pathogen detection in blood culture fluid may be a useful, relatively rapid, inexpensive, and accurate technique for the identification of important causes of bacteremia in the tropics."
CD008892,0,9441049,0,[Prevalence of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium in laying hen flocks battery and on floor housing. Comparative studies using bacteriological and serological demonstration methods].,"The prevalence of Salmonella (S.) enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium is described in 34 flocks of laying chickens. In an attempt to detect the rate of infection comparative bacteriological and serological methods were employed. By cultural methods 47.0% of the floor flocks and 35.3% of the battery flocks were S.e. or S. tm. infected. The same tendency was established with the Bommeli ELISA. Flocks on floor were positive in 64.7% and flocks in batteries were positive in 47.0%. Both methods--bacteriological isolation and serology--yielded more S.e. positive flocks kept on the floor than in battery systems. Long-term studies of four flocks demonstrate a long persistence of antibodies against S.e. in serum and yolk even after one year. Almost all S.e. infected flocks prove a correlation between increase of positive cultures and antibody positive sera. Also, a correlation between levels of absorption values of sera tested in the Bommeli ELISA and positive fecal samples is evident. This is particularly true for eight of 10 flocks. If S.e. infected laying flocks need to be detected, then high absorption values in sera or yolk and a high rate of antibody positive hens provide reasonable good conditions to attempt subsequent bacteriological examinations."

Positive Widal test (antibody titre against S. typhi O antigen of 1:160) was recorded in 61.2 per cent of patients with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid fever and in 58.8 per cent with culture negative but clinically suggestive typhoid fever. In contrast, the same titre was observed in 10.2 per cent patients with other febrile illnesses of known etiology and in 1.8 per cent of normal children. Differences in the positivity of Widal test in patients with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid fever and clinically suggestive but culture negative fever were highly significant (P < 0.000001) when compared to that of patients with non-typhoidal febrile illnesses and normal controls. High specificity and positive predictive value in 1:160 dilution makes the Widal test acceptable as a diagnostic tool."

The authors conducted a retrospective study relative to the extra-intestinal salmonellosis manifested in elderly patients. In order to carry out such a study the authors considered only patients who were in the hospital, who were over the age of 65, and who had a clinical history different from the usual one of gastroenterocolitis. Out of 61 patients who were in hospital 50 were with complete registration data; 9 (18%) were over 65 years of age. The analysis of the clinical cards permitted the identification of 4 cases with unusual clinical histories due to the presence of serious systemic complications (sepsis with prolonged fever and positive blood cultures) or focal infections in extra-intestinal tissues (abscess of soft tissues, osteomyelitis). The authors focused their attention on these and described the general clinical characteristics of each patient, the type and the position of the isolated microorganism, the manifestations or extra-intestinal complications of the infection and the predisposing factors regarding the same complications. For each patient the essential clinical history and the treatment of the disease have been described. The authors conclude by affirming that in the cases of elderly patients with salmonellosis, apart from those infections in positions different from intestinal one, it would be opportune to consider an antimicrobe treatment also for enteritis infections and cases of asymptomatic infection."
CD008892,0,7795095,0,Short course of ofloxacin for treatment of multidrug-resistant typhoid.,"In recent years, multiresistant strains of Salmonella typhi have emerged in many tropical countries. These strains remain highly sensitive to the fluoroquinolone antibiotics, although use of these drugs by children is considered contraindicated because of their reported toxicity in the cartilage of experimental animals. In a paired, open, randomized study during an epidemic of multidrug-resistant typhoid in southern Vietnam, two short-course ofloxacin regimens (15 mg/kg daily for 3 days and 10 mg/kg daily for 5 days) were compared for the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever. Of 438 patients enrolled (of whom 286 were < or = 14 years old), 228 had blood cultures positive for Salmonella species (S. typhi, 207; S. paratyphi A, 19; and S. choleraesuis, 2). There was one treatment failure in a patient who took only one dose of ofloxacin. Otherwise, both regimens were completely effective; there were no proven carriers, and there was no evidence of toxicity, particularly in children. A 3-day course of ofloxacin proved to be safe and highly effective in the treatment of uncomplicated, multidrug-resistant typhoid fever."

CD008892,0,2499204,0,Detection of murine typhus infected fleas with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of Rickettsia typhi antigen in homogenates of pooled or individual laboratory infected fleas is described. The assay uses a double sandwich technique, employing a pool of monoclonal antibodies to capture the antigen and a hyperimmune rabbit serum for antigen detection. Using pools of R. typhi infected Xenopsylla cheopis, Ctenocephalides felis, and Leptopsylla segnis, the sensitivity of the ELISA was compared with direct fluorescent antibody examination of individual fleas for rickettsiae and with rickettsial titers determined by plaque enumeration on primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (PFU). Pooled samples with less than 4 PFU of viable rickettsiae gave ELISA results which were not significantly above background. Both ELISA OD and ELISA titer (last dilution giving an OD that was 2 SD above the control) of a 1:10 dilution of homogenate (4 fleas/ml) were linearly related to rickettsial titer up to 10(6.8) PFU/sample. Multiple freeze-thaws of pools of infected fleas led to a rapid loss of ELISA sensitivity. ELISA assays on single fleas demonstrated large individual variability in rickettsial content. This was independent of the number of days postinfectious feeding or the mean number of PFU/flea (10(1.7-6.9) found for pooled fleas in the same cohort. The sensitivity and ease of performance of ELISA should make it usable under field conditions."

CD008892,0,12464818,0,Fatal salmonella aortitis with mycotic aneurysm rupture.,"Salmonellae most commonly cause uncomplicated cases of gastroenteritis but have a predilection for damaged blood vessels, especially those damaged by atherosclerosis. The abdominal aorta is most frequently affected. The most serious complication of aortitis is mycotic aneurysm formation with subsequent rupture. The authors present the case of a 61-year-old man who was found unresponsive at home 3 days after discharge from the hospital for treatment of gastroenteritis with bacteremia. Postmortem examination revealed a ruptured mycotic aneurysm with a large retroperitoneal hematoma. Numerous gram-negative rods were embedded in the wall of the aorta and surrounding inflammatory infiltrate, compatible with the patient's previously isolated. Whereas abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is most commonly associated with atherosclerosis, the isolation of from blood cultures, coupled with radiographic evidence of gas surrounding the aorta, should raise the suspicion of infectious aortitis. Whereas fatal rupture of an aortic aneurysm secondary to atherosclerosis alone or in conjunction with aortitis will not have an impact on the manner of death, infections are reportable and thus have public health implications."

Eleven patients received amoxicillin, and 15 received ampicillin. Concentrations of the two drugs were measured in the urine and serum on treatment days 1, 2, and 7. The urine levels of both antibiotics were maximal 2 h after administration, and minimal levels were 80-fold higher than the S. typhi minimal inhibitory concentration and 20-fold higher than the S. paratyphi A minimal inhibitory concentration. The serum level of amoxicillin was below the minimal inhibitory concentration of S. paratyphi A 6 h after administration on each of the testing days. The serum antibiotic levels of the two drugs showed no cumulative effect at day 2 or day 7. Of the 11 patients treated with amoxicillin, 1 had positive urine cultures during treatment, and 1 treated with ampicillin continued to be symptomatic.. Recurrence of bacteriuria occurred in three of seven patients with persistent bladder calcification. None of the 26 patients in this study had positive blood culture during or after treatment. Amoxicillin and ampicillin at a dose of 250 mg twice daily were equally successful in treating chronic salmonelluria."
CD008892,0,629635,0,"Typhoid fever. Studies of blood coagulation, bacteremia, and endotoxemia.","Patients with typhoid fever were studied to determine whether disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), circulating bacteria, and endotoxemia were responsible for the signs and symptoms of their illnesses. Coagulation tests in 28 patients detected thrombocytopenia in 17, hypofibrinogenemia in nine, and elevated titers of fibrinogen-related antigens in 20. Repeated testing during convalescence showed a return toward normal values. Intestinal bleeding, however, did not correlate with abnormalities of coagulation tests. Thus, DIC occurred commonly but appeared to be a subclinical event in these patients. In 25 patients with positive blood cultures for Salmonella typhi, quantitative cultures detected from less than 10 to 9 x 10(2) bacteria/ml. Limulus tests for endotoxin in plasma were negative in all 21 patients tested. These results indicated that the concentrations of circulating bacteria and endotoxin in typhoid fever are lower than in other Gram-negative bacterial infections and suggested that circulating bacteria and endotoxin do not play a major role in the pathogenesis of typhoid fever."

Patients who had complication like gastrointestinal tract (GIT) haemorrhage; intestinal perforation and/or shock were excluded from the study. Data were collected in a structured questionnaire. Azithromycin was given at a dose of 10mg/kg /day for a period of 07 days. The time to defervescence was 3.82+/-1.49 days. The minimum defervescence time was 02 days and maximum was 07 days. Clinical cure rate was 94%. No serious adverse effect was noted related to azithromycin therapy except nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Prior treatment with antibiotics did not affect defervescence time (P>0.05). Pre-treatment febrile period has got positive and linear correlation with clinical response (r = +0.593). It was found that once daily administration of oral azithromycin for seven days in the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever was effective and reasonably safe."

Out of these, 30% of the healthy individuals had no detectable Widal titres. Overall agglutinin titres obtained for the healthy population showed that 96% of the individuals had low level reactivity with titres < 1:80 for both H and O antigens of S. typhi, while 4% had titres of 1:160 or above. Agglutinins for S. paratyphi A and C were rarely present in the sera tested. Age and sex were found to have no effect on antibody titre distribution in the two populations but differences in the water source may have affected the percentage of positive tests recorded. In this typhoid endemic region titres upto 1:80 are not uncommon but both H and O titres of 1:160 and above found in conjunction with the clinical picture may be taken to be suggestive of typhoid fever."

Measurement of intestinal antibodies by radioimmunoassay.,"Antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and protein antigens of S. typhi in secretions of small intestine obtained from 12 typhoid patients, four typhoid carriers and 16 non-typhoid control subjects were measured by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay technique. Intestinal secretions obtained from typhoid patients as a group had significantly higher anti-LPS and anti-protein antibodies than those from the control group. These antibodies were both IgM and IgA classes. There was no correlation between the IgM or IgA antibody levels in serum and those in the intestinal secretions. In the intestinal secretions obtained from typhoid carriers, on the other hand, only IgA-class antibodies to the LPS and protein antigens of S. typhi were present at high levels."

Measurement of serum antibodies by radioimmunoassay.,"Serum antibody responses to the lipopolysaccharide and protein antigens of S. typhi in typhoid patients were studied using a solid-phase radioimmunoassay technique. Sera from 24 adult typhoid patients and 20 non-typhoid adult controls were compared. As a group, sera from typhoid patients showed increased IgA, IgG and IgM immunoglobulin levels and gave significantly higher anti-LPS and anti-protein antibody titres in all three major immunoglobulin classes than did non-typhoid controls. Levels of antibodies against LPS or protein in sera of typhoid patients were highly variable with a skew distribution. A good correlation was found between antibody titres to the LPS antigen and those to a protein antigen. No correlation, however, was found between the anti-LPS antibody titres measured by radioimmunoassay and the anti-O antibody titres measured by the Widal agglutination test. Titration of anti-LPS or anti-protein antibodies by radioimmunoassay was found to be more sensitive and specific than Widal test for the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever. The advantages of measuring antibody response by radioimmunoassay over conventional Widal test are discussed."

CD008892,0,17433390,0,Serological and blood culture investigations of Nepalese fever patients.,"Serological testing of paired (i.e. admission and convalescent) sera from 103 fever patients in Kathmandu, Nepal, was performed to estimate the prevalence rates of scrub typhus, murine typhus, Leptospira and dengue virus antibodies and to determine their role in the cause of active infections. Blood cultures from 15 patients grew Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, 8 grew S. Paratyphi A and 6 grew other bacteria. Diagnostic antibody levels were detected against murine typhus (27/103; 26%), scrub typhus (23/103; 22%), Leptospira (10/103; 10%) and dengue virus (8/103; 8%). Nineteen patients (18%) had diagnostically raised antibodies to more than one infectious agent. Seven S. Typhi (7/15; 47%) and two S. Paratyphi A (2/8; 25%) patients had significant scrub typhus, murine typhus, Leptospira or dengue virus IgM antibody titres. This study confirms the presence of leptospiral, rickettsial and dengue infections in Kathmandu as well as evidence for mixed infections with S. Typhi and Orientia tsutsugamushi or Rickettsia typhi. These infections should be kept in mind when considering the differential diagnoses of fever and empirical treatment options in Nepal. Many patients demonstrated static IgM antibody results between paired serum collections, suggesting recent rather than acutely active infections."
CD008892,0,3696823,0,Diagnostic value of the Widal test in childhood typhoid fever.,"The usefulness of the Widal test in diagnosing childhood typhoid fever in endemic areas was investigated. The test was done on 150 children with other febrile illnesses and 98 bacteriologically proved cases of typhoid fever. Of the 150 children with nontyphoidal fever, only one had an H agglutinin titer of 1:50. Using an H or O agglutinin titer of 1:50 or more as a criterion for diagnosis, a positive Widal test was found in 88% of typhoid fever cases on the first occasion on which the test was done. If the test was repeated at least 94% of the typhoid cases had a significant result. The Widal test is a useful diagnostic test in children in endemic areas, provided interpretation of the test is made against background information relating to agglutinin levels in normal children in the region."

CD008892,0,17244813,0,Ciprofloxacin treatment failure in a case of typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.,This report describes a case of ciprofloxacin treatment failure in a patient with enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A. The organism was isolated from a blood culture from a patient who was treated with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 h) for 13 days. The organism showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC 0.75 microg ml-1) and was resistant to nalidixic acid. The patient was then placed on intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g every 12 h) and responded within 3 days. The patient was discharged after 9 days on ceftriaxone with no relapse on follow-up. This case adds to the increasing incidence of treatment failures with ciprofloxacin in typhoid fever caused by typhoid salmonellae with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. It also highlights the inadequacy of current laboratory methods for fluoroquinolone susceptibility testing in adequately predicting in vivo activity of ciprofloxacin against typhoid salmonellae and supports calls for new guidelines for fluoroquinolone susceptibility testing of these organisms.

CD008892,0,17477815,0,Polymorphisms in proinflammatory genes and susceptibility to typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.,"Host genetic factors are thought to contribute to susceptibility and outcome in infectious diseases. A polymorphism in a proinflammatory gene, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA - 308), was recently found to be associated with susceptibility to typhoid fever. As the observation was made in hospitalized patients, a potential confounder could be that the TNFA polymorphism is associated with the severity of established illness resulting in hospital admission rather than susceptibility to disease. We tested whether the association with TNFA - 308 is present also in typhoid fever patients enrolled in a community-based case-control study in an endemic area in Indonesia. Common polymorphisms in other proinflammatory genes were assayed as well. Samples of patients with blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever (n = 90) and paratyphoid fever (n = 26) and fever controls (n = 337) were compared with those of community controls (n = 322). In these groups, we analyzed polymorphisms in TNFA by PCR and RFLP, polymorphisms of IFNG, IL1A, IL1B, IL1R1, TNFRSF1A, CASP1, and CRP by Sequenom MassArray (San Diego, CA), and polymorphisms in IL12B and IFNGR1 by fragment length analysis. The IL1R1 polymorphisms were nearly absent in the Indonesian population. The TNFA - 308 polymorphism was not associated with typhoid fever (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.1-1.0) in this population. The polymorphisms at TNFA - 238 or in IFNG, IL1A, IL1B, IL12B, TNFRSF1A, IFNGR1, CASP1, and CRP were also not associated with typhoid or paratyphoid fever. We conclude that polymorphisms in proinflammatory genes do not contribute to susceptibility to typhoid fever and, in view of earlier findings, suggest that the TNFA - 308 polymorphism is likely related to severity of established disease rather than to susceptibility per se."

(Group 1, 25 patients), with treatment for ten days, 750 mg b.i.d. (Group 2, 25 patients). Clinical cure was defined as defervescence of fever by day 5 of treatment, with an absence of complications and no clinical relapse. The clinical cure rate was 84% for group 1 and 96% for group 2; the difference in these rates was not statistically significant. The blood cultures of all patients were sterile by day 2 of treatment and remained so until the sixth month of follow-up. It was concluded that ciprofloxacin treatment for ten days in enteric fever is not necessary. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy."
CD008892,0,12742511,0,Correlation of antimutagenic activity and suppression of CYP1A with the lipophilicity of alkyl gallates and other phenolic compounds.,"Alkyl gallates are widely used as food antioxidants. Methyl, ethyl, propyl, lauryl, and cetyl gallates showed antimutagenicity to activated 2-aminoanthracene (2AA)-induced SOS responses in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. They also exhibited a suppressive effect on 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC)-induced cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) in human hepatoma HepG2 cells, as indexed by the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, and on CYP1A protein level. Both antimutagenicity and suppression of CYP1A appeared to be dependent on alkyl chain lengths, which suggested lipophilicity dependence. Based on those results, we investigated 26 other phenolic compounds for their lipophilicity, antimutagenicity and inhibition of EROD activity. The lipophilicity correlated well with the inhibition of EROD activity (r=0.78), and the inhibition of EROD activity correlated with the antimutagenicity of those compounds (r=0.71). The results suggest that the lipophilicity of the phenolic compounds may be an important factor in their ability to inhibit EROD activity."

Twenty patients were openly randomized to receive ciprofloxacin and 22 to receive ceftriaxone. The outcome was classified as clinical failure in 6 patients (27%) in the ceftriaxone group, but in none in the ciprofloxacin group (p = 0.01). The mean duration of fever was four days in the ciprofloxacin group and about five days in the ceftriaxone group (p = 0.04). In the six patients in the ceftriaxone group who experienced failure, therapy was switched to ciprofloxacin and the patients became afebrile and asymptomatic within 48 hours. Patients with resistant strains of Salmonella typhi and patients with sensitive strains responded equally well to ciprofloxacin therapy. Analysis of a subset of 12 of the multiresistant strains revealed that resistance was encoded for by a transferable 180 kilobase plasmid. Ciprofloxacin represents a useful treatment option in areas where multiresistant strains are likely to be encountered."
CD008892,0,10449469,0,Value of a single-tube widal test in diagnosis of typhoid fever in Vietnam.,"The diagnostic value of an acute-phase single-tube Widal test for suspected typhoid fever was evaluated with 2,000 Vietnamese patients admitted to an infectious disease referral hospital between 1993 and 1998. Test patients had suspected typhoid fever and a blood culture positive for Salmonella typhi (n= 1,400) or Salmonella paratyphi A (n = 45). Control patients had a febrile illness for which another cause was confirmed (malaria [n = 103], dengue [n = 76], or bacteremia due to another microorganism [n = 156] or tetanus (n = 265). An O-agglutinin titer of >/=100 was found in 18% of the febrile controls and 7% of the tetanus patients. Corresponding values for H agglutinins were 8 and 1%, respectively. The O-agglutinin titer was >/=100 in 83% of the blood culture-positive typhoid fever cases, and the H-agglutinin titer was >/=100 in 67%. The disease prevalence in investigated patients in this hospital was 30.8% (95% confidence interval, 26.8 to 35.1%); at this prevalence, an elevated level of H agglutinins gave better positive predictive values for typhoid fever than did O agglutinins. With a cutoff titer of >/=200 for O agglutinin or >/=100 for H agglutinin, the Widal test would diagnose correctly 74% of the blood culture-positive cases of typhoid fever. However, 14% of the positive results would be false-positive, and 10% of the negative results would be false-negative. The Widal test can be helpful in the laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever in Vietnam if interpreted with care."
CD008892,0,2691839,0,"Transcriptional polarity enhances the contribution of the internal promoter, ilvEp, in the expression of the ilvGMEDA operon in wild-type Escherichia coli K12.","The ilvG gene of Escherichia coli K12 produces a cryptic peptide as a result of a frameshift mutation located approximately halfway through the coding sequence of the gene. This mutation is polar on expression of the downstream genes (ilvEDA) because transcription terminates within the translationally barren region that results from the mutation. Contrary to this, Salmonella typhimurium produces a full-length functional ilvG protein and is therefore unlikely to manifest this polarity event. E. coli K12 strains with mutations either in the ilvG gene (which restores a full-length protein) or in the rho gene, relieve this polarity suggesting that this event couples transcription and translation in a manner analogous to attenuation. This paper describes experiments designed to determine the molecular nature and location of the polarity event. Most significantly, this work establishes the contribution of the internal promoter (ilvEp, located downstream of the polar site) to the expression of the downstream genes in E. coli K12 wild-type and mutant strains (ilvG) and by extension to the role of this promoter in S. typhimurium. This analysis suggests that ilvEp contributes as much as 90% of ilvEDA expression in wild-type E. coli K12 and only 15% in wild-type S. typhimurium when grown under non-repressing conditions."

Of these 73 patients, 11 (15%) suffered a clinical relapse, with fever and positive blood cultures, within 3 months of their original illness. Using plasmids as epidemiologic markers, we found that three patients who subsequently relapsed were initially infected with more than one strain of Salmonella typhi. There was a highly significant association between relapse and isolation of a strain containing either a 24- or a 38-kilobase plasmid at the time of the original infection; however, we were unable to show any evidence of homology between these two plasmids. Our data indicate that infection with multiple strains is not uncommon in this endemic area and suggest that relapse may be partly strain dependent."

This problem opens the way for a further study with the aim of finding an alternative serological test with a high degree of reliability for the detection of typhoid fever. Given the above mentioned purpose, a study on the reliability of a laboratory test, the dot-enzyme-immunoassay outer membrane protein (DOT-EIA-OMP) was conducted comprising sera from 207 subjects (44 adult typhoid patients, 43 adult nontyphoid patients and sera from 120 adult healthy individuals serving as controls. The result of the study revealed that the diagnostic sensitivity of the DOT-EIA-OMP test for the detection of typhoid fever can be classified as high (93.16%), the specificity as moderate (76.74%), the efficiency (accuracy), positive predictive value and negative predictive value as high (85.06%, 80.39% and 91.66% respectively). The within run and between days reproducibility of this test was very high (CV=0%). Analysis of data obtained indicated that the DOT-EIA-OMP test was a reliable screening test for the establishment of the diagnosis of typhoid fever in health centers with simple laboratory facilities. The application of this test has to be more contemplated in countries where the cost of laboratory test is a problem."

Typhi) and Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A). In this study, analysis of a collection of Salmonella strains showed that all S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains tested harbor an intact copy of the corresponding clyA variant, i.e. clyA(STy) and clyA(SPaA), respectively. On the other hand, clyA proved to be absent in the S. enterica serovar Paratyphi B and serovar Paratyphi C strains, in various non-typhoid S. enterica subsp. enterica serovars (Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Choleraesuis, Dublin, and Gallinarum), and in S. enterica subsp. arizonae and Salmonella bongori strains. When grown under normal laboratory conditions, the S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains produced only basal amounts of ClyA protein and did not exhibit a clyA-dependent hemolytic phenotype. RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses as well as phenotypic data revealed, however, that the expression of clyA(STy) and clyA(SPaA) can be activated by the Salmonella transcription factor SlyA. In addition, osmotic protection assays and lipid bilayer experiments demonstrated that the hemolytic ClyA(STy) and ClyA(SPaA) proteins are effective pore-forming toxins which, similar to E. coli ClyA, generate large, stable, moderately cation-selective channels in target membranes. Taken together with our recent serological findings which have indicated that S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains produce substantial amounts of ClyA during human infection, these data suggest that ClyA may play a role in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A pathogenesis."

The immuno-dot-blot assay could detect 0.02 ng of purified enterotoxin. The amount of toxin antigen detected varied widely from strain to strain. Fourteen of the 25 polymyxin B-treated extracts of bacteria harvested from 6-h Casamino Acids-yeast extract broth cultures gave positive results in both serologic assays as well as in rabbit skin tests for delayed permeability factor. An additional strain was positive only in the immuno-dot-blot. Five of six stool isolates and six of seven blood isolates tested gave positive reactions. Two isolates of Salmonella enteritidis tested were also positive. The immuno-dot-blot test appears to be a simple, rapid, and reliable method for detection of cholera-related enterotoxin antigen in S. typhimurium. The demonstration of a cholera-related enterotoxin, even in small amounts, in a facultative intracellular pathogen raises interesting questions regarding its potential role in pathogenesis both of diarrheal disease and systemic infections caused by salmonellae."
CD008892,0,15710609,0,A Salmonella typhimurium effector protein SifA is modified by host cell prenylation and S-acylation machinery.,"SifA is a Salmonella effector protein that is required for maintenance of the vacuolar membrane that surrounds replicating bacteria. It associates with the Salmonella-containing vacuole but how it interacts with the membrane is unknown. Here we show by immunofluorescence, S100 fractionation and Triton X-114 partitioning that the membrane association and targeting properties of SifA are influenced by a motif encoded within the C-terminal six amino acids. This sequence shares homology with both CAAX and Rab geranylgeranyl transferase prenylation motifs. We characterized the post-translational processing of SifA and showed that the cysteine residue within the CAAX motif is modified by isoprenoid addition through the action of protein geranylgeranyl transferase I. SifA was additionally modified by S-acylation of an adjacent cysteine residue. Similar modifications to host cell proteins regulate numerous functions including protein targeting, membrane association, protein-protein interaction, and signal transduction. This is the only known example of a bacterial effector protein that is modified both by mammalian cell S-acylation and prenylation machinery."
CD008892,0,11036037,0,Biological cost of AmpC production for Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium.,"Chromosomally mediated AmpC-type beta-lactamases are frequently found among Enterobacteriaceae. Hyperproduction of AmpC beta-lactamase results in high-level resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. One striking feature of Salmonella is the absence of the structural ampC gene, encoding AmpC beta-lactamase, in contrast with other members in the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Escherichia, Citrobacter, or Enterobacter. The horizontal acquisition of ampC genes is one of the causes of the increased resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactamase inhibitors among gram-negative rods. Nevertheless, despite the high number of beta-lactam-resistant Salmonella isolates so far described, only two strains expressing resistance to cephalosporin and beta-lactamase inhibitors which is mediated by AmpC-type enzymes have been found. In this work, data are provided which support the possibility that the maintenance and expression of the ampC gene may represent an unbearable cost for Salmonella in terms of reduction of some of its lifestyle attributes, such as growth rate and invasiveness. The deleterious AmpC burden can be eliminated by decreasing the production of AmpC when both the regulatory gene, ampR, and ampC are present in Salmonella. Thus, it is suggested that the two genes have to be acquired together by Salmonella, leading to an inducible beta-lactam resistance phenotype. AmpC synthesis did not produce major variations in the peptidoglycan composition of Salmonella."

Pooled pen fecal samples (n = 118) and pig rectal swabs (n = 51) were cultured for Salmonella by the 1-2 Test, which was compared with the standard isolation protocol currently used in our laboratory. In addition, pen fecal samples known to be free of Salmonella were spiked with various concentrations of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and cultured by both methods to determine the minimum number of organisms needed to produce a positive result. When naturally contaminated pen feces and rectal swabs were used, results obtained with the standard culture method were similar to those obtained with the 1-2 Test. However, the 1-2 Test did outperform the standard culture method when the spiked feces samples were tested (chi2 = 4.00). The test kit reduced the time and materials required for the detection of Salmonella in swine feces. The results of this study indicate that the 1-2 Test is an accurate method for monitoring Salmonella in swine feces."

These infections are not always rapidly diagnosed as a cause of bloodstream infections because of the limitations of blood culture, which greatly affects clinical care as a result of treatment delays. A molecular diagnostic assay that could rapidly detect and identify S. enterica species infections as a cause of sepsis is needed. Nine typhoidal and nontyphoidal S. enterica serovars were used to establish the limit of detection (LOD) of a previously published 16S rRNA gene PCR (16S PCR) in mock whole blood specimens. In addition, 16 typhoidal and nontyphoidal S. enterica serovars were used to evaluate the serovar differentiation capability of 16S PCR coupled with high-resolution melt analysis. The overall LOD of 16S PCR for the nine typhoidal and nontyphoidal S. enterica serovars analyzed was <10 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) in mock whole blood specimens, with the lowest and highest LOD at <1 CFU/mL and 9 CFU/mL, respectively. By high-resolution melt analysis, the typhoidal and nontyphoidal S. enterica serovar groups analyzed each generated a unique grouping code, allowing for serovar-level identification. 16S PCR coupled with high-resolution melt analysis could be a useful molecular diagnostic that could enhance the current diagnostic, treatment, and surveillance methods of S. enterica bloodstream infections."

CD008892,0,1838474,0,Infection and reinfection of chickens with Salmonella typhimurium: bacteriology and immune responses.,"Four-day-old chickens infected orally with a spectinomycin-resistant (Spcr) mutant of a highly invasive avian Salmonella typhimurium strain excreted salmonellae in the feces for at least 10 weeks. When these chickens were reinfected at this time with a nalidixic acid-resistant (Nalr) mutant of the same strain, they excreted this mutant in significantly smaller numbers (P less than 0.01) than did a previously uninfected control group. The Nalr mutant had a shorter survival rate in the tissues of the immunized chickens than in tissues of the control birds. The Spcr mutant stimulated strong IgG, IgA, and IgM responses in serum, small-intestinal contents, and bile. These were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against antigens of crude whole bacterial cell protein sonicate, lipopolysaccharide, flagella, and outer-membrane proteins. There was some evidence of an anamnestic response with IgA in bile following reinfection with the Salmonella. The peak response of antibody-producing cells from the spleens of infected chickens, assayed by solid-phase ELISA, occurred at 3 weeks postinoculation. A strong delayed hypersensitivity reaction, detected by foot-pad swelling after inoculation with either whole-cell or outer-membrane proteins, was observed between 2 and 5 weeks after infection with the Spcr mutant. The data indicate that outer-membrane proteins are major immunogens for both humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune system."
CD008892,0,12951256,0,Monoclonal antibody against O:5 Salmonella antigen cross-reacts with unidentified lipopolysaccharide epitope of Salmonella serogroup O:8 (C(2)-C(3)).,"Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 8aC10 against Salmonella O:5 antigen was obtained after immunization of BALB/c mice with live attenuated mutant of Salmonella typhimurium. Antigen specificity of the MAb was characterized by ELISA, immunoblotting, passive hemagglutination (PHA), passive hemolysis and agglutination tests. In ELISA, PHA and immunoblotting the MAb reacted only with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Salmonella strains from group O:4 (B), expressing O:5 antigen. The MAb agglutinated in addition Salmonella strains with O:8 antigen from group C(2)-C(3) but did not react with purified LPS. These results demonstrate O:5 specificity of MAb 8aC10. Cross-agglutination with group C(2)-C(3) suggests the presence of similar but not identical epitope in O:8 expressing strains, which is possibly localized onto O-acetyl-abequose and abequose residues bound with a alpha-1-->3 linkage to the basic polysaccharide backbone of Salmonella LPS with O:5 and O:8 antigen respectively."

The history of three children, admitted in the summer of 1985, will be discussed, in one of them the disease had a complicated course. A short review of the literature is given, especially regarding pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. Cultures of blood, faeces and bone-marrow are essential for diagnosis. Bone marrow culture remains the most effective method for recovery of the causative agent, especially in children who previously were treated with antibiotics. Chloramphenicol still is the drug of choice in treatment. Vaccination with the oral typhoid vaccine of children who intend to visit an endemic area is recommended."

A positive blood culture for S. typhi and sensitivity to cefuroxime axetil were confirmed prior to treatment. On admission, the baseline signs and symptoms were recorded and treatment initiated with cefuroxime axetil in a dose of 500 mg bd; which was continued for 7 days after normalization of temperature. The various clinical parameters were followed up daily during the treatment period and discharge permitted on normalization of temperature. Blood culture for S. typhi was repeated 3 days after stopping treatment. Follow-up Widal, stool and urine cultures were done wherever possible to check for relapse or carrier state. All the patients responded clinically to treatment and had bacteriologically negative blood cultures by the end of 14 days treatment. 87% of the patients responded within 7 days of treatment of which 60% were graded as Excellent responders as they responded within 4 days itself; while 13% took a longer time to respond. There were no relapses or carrier state as indicated by negative follow-up stool cultures. Only one patient reported a side-effect of mild headache confirming the safety of the drug. We conclude that Cefuroxime axetil in a dose of 500 mg bd is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of multi drug resistant enteric fever."

Out of 50 Salmonella strains isolated, 37 were S typhi and 13 S paratyphi A. All S typhi isolates were sensitive in vitro to gentamicin and ceftriaxone while sensitivity to ciprofloxacin was 73%, ampicillin 29.7%, chloromphenicol 27%, tetracycline 27% and co-trimoxazole 13.5%. Multidrug resistance (Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Cotrimoxazale and Tetracycline) was observed in 62% isolates. All Sparatyphi A isolates were sensitive to all the antibiotics. Clinical response to the antibiotic therapy was as follows: Group I--Ampicillin + Gentamicin: 15 cases, clinical response (CR), 9.1% (S typhi) and 75% (S paratyphi A), mean day of defervescence 5.33 days. Group II--Ciprofloxacin: 29 cases, clinical response 47.6% (S typhi) and 75% (S paratyphi A), mean day of defervescence--5.22 days. Group--III Ceftriaxone: 30 cases, clinical response 100% in all, mean day of defervescence--4.93 days. Thus we observed highly significant discrepancy in antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolates and clinical response. Most importantly we observed significantly delayed clinical response to the ceftriaxone. This may be indicative of evolving resistance to ceftriaxone."

These patients suffered from moderate to severe infections which were not life-threatening. Twelve had urinary tract infections (UTI), 3 of which were positive blood cultures. Four patients had soft tissue infections (one with a Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus bacteremia). Three patients had respiratory infections, and one elderly patient had Salmonella typhimurium gastroenteritis. All the patients in this series were clinically cured. Three patients with a UTI experienced reinfection. The woman with S. typhimurium gastroenteritis had persistent positive fecal cultures, but was asymptomatic. These 4 patients did not require further antibiotic therapy. The only side effect observed was mild diarrhea in one patient. Two other ambulatory patients with typhoid fever were treated with ceftriaxone 2 g daily I.V. for 10 days with excellent results. Our work showed that ceftriaxone 1 g daily can be a safe and inexpensive antimicrobial choice to shorten or prevent hospitalization."

CD008892,0,10772578,1,Detection of IgM antibody against region IV flagellin of Salmonella paratyphi A.,"Salmonella paratyphi A is a pathogenic bacterium that causes paratyphoid fever. The current laboratory diagnostic techniques are unsatisfactory. To improve diagnosis, a plasmid (pSK-8E) encoding phase 1 flagellin gene nucleotide position 452-890 from S. paratyphi A has been constructed. The recombinant protein expressed from the plasmid has been used to develop an indirect ELISA for IgM antibody detection. Sera from patients with hemoculture positive for S. paratyphi A, S. typhi, other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and dengue hemorrhagic fever as well as from healthy control subjects were tested. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the test were 56.9%, 98.8%, 90.6% and 92.1%, respectively. Since the sensitivity was low, the explanation for this result was investigated. It was found that the sensitivity of the test could be increased to 83.3% if the sera were obtained 9-12 days after onset of fever. The sera obtained earlier or later gave only 33.3% and 66.6% sensitivity, respectively. This result suggests that the IgM antibody detection assay which we have developed is a valuable tool for diagnosis of S. paratyphi A infection when the serum samples are taken at the appropriate time."

Antisera to S. typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, prepared by immunizing rabbits with acetone-treated cells of the corresponding bacterial species, all reacted against S1Da and S1Db as shown both by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Forty nine (98%) of the 50 tested sera obtained from typhoid patients while only 4 (8%) of the 50 sera obtained from febrile non-typhoid patients showed antibodies to S1Da and S1Db with ELISA titres above 1.000. S1Da and S1Db were then tested against 80 sera collected from 24 volunteers who had received a live typhoid vaccine Ty21a. Those vaccinees, who had antibodies to the LPS antigens of S. typhi following Ty21a vaccination, also developed antibodies to both the S1Da and S1Db antigens. Antigenically, S1Da and S1Db were different from each other and from the LPS antigens of S. typhi. S1Da and S1Db were basically protein in nature, the reactivity of these antigens against a positive control antiserum was destroyed by pronase, i.e., the addition of pronase after coating the MICROELISA plates with S1Da or S1Db reduced the ELISA titre to a minimum. Treatment with pronase, however, did not affect the ELISA titre when plates coated with the LPS antigens of S. typhi were used as the solid-phase antigen."

Previously reported clinical trials with oral cefixime therapy given as a 12-day regimen (20-30 mg/kg divided twice daily) demonstrated both safety and efficacy. An open trial was undertaken to investigate a short course (8-day) regimen of oral cefixime in an Egyptian public fever hospital. Eighty children were initially enrolled with blood culture confirmation in 60 children. Clinical cure was documented in 57 (95 per cent) with three children requiring a change in antibiotic regimen due to therapeutic failure and one child with culture-confirmed relapsed 21 days post-therapy. All S. typhi isolates were sensitive to cefixime as measured by disk diffusion. Cefixime was well-tolerated with only mild side-effects, including nausea/vomiting (8 per cent) and abdominal cramping with loose stools (6 per cent), which may have been secondary to typhoid fever. Cefixime given in a short 8-day course is safe and effective in the management of MDR typhoid fever in children."
CD008892,0,2689350,0,"ELISA for antibodies to lipid A, lipopolysaccharides and other hydrophobic antigens.","A simple, sensitive and rapid ELISA method for the quantification and characterization of antibodies to lipid A has been developed, which can also be applied to other hydrophobic antigens. For coating, antigens were applied to the wells of ELISA plates as solutions in a mixture of chloroform and ethanol 1:9 (v/v), and the solvent evaporated in a stream of warm air. Under these conditions a high coating efficiency was achieved, which made the assay highly sensitive. The use of the above organic solvent considerably reduced the nonspecific adsorption of immunoglobulins to the solid phase, making the usual blocking of unspecific binding sites with BSA or gelatine unnecessary. For screening of lipid A antibodies in the sera of immunized animals, coating with 0.2 microgram of the corresponding antigen per well was found to be suitable. For optimal measurement of antibodies in pre-immune sera, sera of healthy human donors, and of monoclonal antibodies, higher amounts of antigen (1-2 micrograms/well) had to be used. The coating method described here proved excellent also for other antigens directly soluble in organic solvents, such as Re-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or gangliosides. In addition, the method was successfully applied to less hydrophobic antigens, such as LPS of the classes Ra to Rd and S forms, and lipoteichoic acid. These could be brought into solution in chloroform/ethanol by diluting their aqueous solutions with a large volume of the organic mixture."
CD008892,0,16957345,0,Microarray-based detection of bacteria by on-chip PCR.,"In this chapter, a protocol called on-chip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is presented for the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarray-based detection of bacterial target sequences. On-chip PCR combines, in a single step, the conventional amplification of a target with a simultaneous, nested PCR round intended for target detection. While freely diffusible primers are deployed for amplification, the nested PCR is initiated by oligonucleotide primers bound to a solid phase. Thus, on-chip PCR allows the single-step amplification and characterization of a DNA sample as a result of separation in liquid and solid-phase reactions. In contrast to conventional PCR, the reaction is performed directly on the flat surface of a glass slide that holds an array of covalently attached nested primers. The bacterial target DNA is amplified and probed using primers identifying either species-specific sequence regions of ribosomal DNA or unique bacterial target genes, such as virulence or resistance factors. The microarray is produced using standard spotting equipment with an array layout containing a high number of replicates. Fluorescence scanning of on-chip PCR slides allows the rapid detection of the target of interest. The protocol described herein will show how on-chip PCR can be used to detect and precisely identify DNA of bacterial origin."

Salmonella sp. isolates with the same phenotype were isolated in three samples of marlin mousse manufactured on 27 October 2008. The constituents of the mousse were smoked marlin, raw eggs, bovine gelatin, oil, and cream. A laboratory investigation of one sample of marlin mousse manufactured 3 days later, and the individual ingredients sampled a week after production of the contaminated batch were all negative for Salmonella. Serotyping and minimum inhibitory concentration determination were performed on 12 patient isolates related to the outbreak and two mousse isolates. All isolates belonged to Salmonella serovar Typhimurium and were pansusceptible to all antimicrobials tested. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that all the isolates were indistinguishable, thus implicating the mousse as the vehicle of the outbreak."

All cases were diagnosed by a positive culture for Salmonella typhi in either of their clinical specimens. Of the total number of 130 patients, 57% contracted the disease abroad; this population increased in later years as the total numbers of cases decreased. The period from disease onset to diagnosis averaged 14 days with 20% of the cases requiring over three weeks to establish a diagnosis. As for symptomatology relative bradycardia was seen in less than half of the cases, and rose spots or splenomegaly in less than one third. A positive blood culture was the most frequent test establishing the diagnosis followed by a positive stool culture. Intestinal bleeding was recognized in as many as 35 cases (27%) and even intestinal perforation occurred in two cases (1.5%). Chloramphenicol was most commonly employed during the early study period, however, during the late period it was replaced by fluoroquinolones. The clinical cure rate was 98% with regimens that include fluoroquinolones/quinolone; however it was 87% with the other antimicrobial regimens. Bacteriological relapse occurred in 25% of the non-fluoroquinolone group while only in 2.0% in the fluoroquinolone/quinolone group. Four strains of Salmonella typhi that were multi-resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole were isolated in travelers from Asia. Early diagnosis by appropriate bacteriological examination regardless of classical symptomatology should be stressed and the use of fluoroquinolones is warranted in the treatment of typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,19591599,0,Invasive non-Typhi Salmonella disease in Africa.,"Invasive non-Typhi Salmonella is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, where it is a leading cause of bloodstream infection. Some host risk factors have been established, but little is known about environmental reservoirs and predominant modes of transmission, so prevention strategies are underdeveloped. Although foodborne transmission from animals to humans predominates in high-income countries, it has been postulated that transmission between humans, both within and outside health care facilities, may be important in sub-Saharan Africa. Antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol is common among non-Typhi Salmonella strains; therefore, wider use of alternative agents may be warranted for empirical therapy. Development of vaccines targeting the leading invasive non-Typhi Salmonella serotypes Typhimurium and Enteritidis is warranted. The clinical presentation of non-Typhi Salmonella bacteremia is nonspecific and, in the absence of blood culture, may be confused with other febrile illnesses, such as malaria. Much work remains to be done to understand and control invasive non-Typhi Salmonella disease in sub-Saharan Africa."

Screening methods included the gel diffusion precipitation test (GD), counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and the indirect haemagglutination test (IHA). Control populations consisting of asymptomatic cyst passers, non-amoebic individuals, patients with giardiasis and cases of enteric fever were also screened using the above tests. All (100%) cases of amoebic liver abscess and 75-80% of hepatic amoebiasis without overt abscess formation could be detected by serology, with good correlation between the tests used. However, the interpretation of serology in cases of proven and suspected intestinal amoebiasis posed two main problems. The presence of low antibody levels even in proven cases and the persistence of antibodies due to past infection was found to reduce the diagnostic efficiency of serology for acute intestinal amoebiasis. There was no statistical difference between intestinal cases and controls when comparing either percentage of cases detected or titre of antibody obtained. The results of this study indicate that serology for acute intestinal amoebiasis can be unreliable; however, it is of undoubted value as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis in cases of hepatic amoebiasis."

When all three antigens were combined the reactivity to any of the antigens was found to be 59% in confirmed typhoid cases, 79% in presumptive typhoid cases and 93% in patients who were simultaneously positive by blood culture and Widal agglutination. However, none of the sera from 45 controls gave a positive precipitation reaction with any of the antigens. It is concluded that counter-current immuno-electrophoresis is a rapid test with low sensitivity and high specificity with Vi antigen, a panel of antigens being most effective, and is, therefore, recommended for rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever."

CD008892,0,21085575,0,The burden and characteristics of enteric fever at a healthcare facility in a densely populated area of Kathmandu.,"Enteric fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A (S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A) remains a major public health problem in many settings. The disease is limited to locations with poor sanitation which facilitates the transmission of the infecting organisms. Efficacious and inexpensive vaccines are available for S. Typhi, yet are not commonly deployed to control the disease. Lack of vaccination is due partly to uncertainty of the disease burden arising from a paucity of epidemiological information in key locations. We have collected and analyzed data from 3,898 cases of blood culture-confirmed enteric fever from Patan Hospital in Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City (LSMC), between June 2005 and May 2009. Demographic data was available for a subset of these patients (n = 527) that were resident in LSMC and who were enrolled in trials. We show a considerable burden of enteric fever caused by S. Typhi (2,672; 68.5%) and S. Paratyphi A (1,226; 31.5%) at this Hospital over a four year period, which correlate with seasonal fluctuations in rainfall. We found that local population density was not related to incidence and we identified a focus of infections in the east of LSMC. With data from patients resident in LSMC we found that the median age of those with S. Typhi (16 years) was significantly less than S. Paratyphi A (20 years) and that males aged 15 to 25 were disproportionately infected. Our findings provide a snapshot into the epidemiological patterns of enteric fever in Kathmandu. The uneven distribution of enteric fever patients within the population suggests local variation in risk factors, such as contaminated drinking water. These findings are important for initiating a vaccination scheme and improvements in sanitation. We suggest any such intervention should be implemented throughout the LSMC area."
CD008892,0,13725751,0,Studies on infection and immunity in experimental typhoid fever. I. Typhoid fever in chimpanzees orally infected with Salmonella typhosa.,"A disease resembling human typhoid fever has been induced by feeding live cultures of Salmonella typhosa to young chimpanzees, thus confirming the classical reports of Grünbaum and of Metchnikoff and Besredka. Detailed clinical observations, results of stool and blood cultures, and serological studies have confirmed the impression that the disease produced in chimpanzees closely resembles the mild form of human typhoid fever frequently seen in childhood. Gross and histologic examination of intestines, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and other organs of orally infected chimpanzees has demonstrated that the pathological findings are essentially indistinguishable from those seen in mild typhoid fever in man. The clinical spectrum of disease seen in chimpanzees ranged from moderately severe illness, through transitory illness, to afebrile infection with or without bacteriemia (but invariably with an antibody response), occasionally leading to the development of persisting biliary infection and the carrier state. Thus the range of illness observed in chimpanzees resembled that seen in man, except that the severe and complicated forms of typhoid fever were not observed in the chimpanzee. A reason for this difference is proposed and discussed. In contrast to the limitations imposed upon the interpretation of human epidemiologic observations, it has been possible to demonstrate in the chimpanzee that clinical variation in disease pattern from animal to animal may occur despite the administration of the same dose of the same bacterial strain simultaneously to an entire group of animals under study; in other words, variation in clinical pattern is dependent on inherent, non-specific host factors as well as on dose, strain or preceding state of immunity. Variation in dose and in challenge strain of S. typhosa employed also appeared to have an effect upon the likelihood of producing febrile as against afebrile infection in chimpanzees. The dose required to produce clinical disease, even with the more virulent strain, was excessively large compared to what is believed to be the dose required to produce illness in man; the limitations of this assumption, and suggested explanations for the findings, are discussed. The production of the spectrum of typhoid fever in the chimpanzee has made possible the study of basic problems in this disease which are not amenable to definitive study through the use of prevailing laboratory techniques."

Essentially typhoid fever is associated with high mortality particularly because of the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains. Thus, a rapid blood-culture based bacterial species diagnosis including an immediate sub-differentiation of the various serovars is mandatory. At present, MALDI-TOF based intact cell mass spectrometry (ICMS) advances to a widely used routine identification tool for bacteria and fungi. In this study, we investigated the appropriateness of ICMS to identify pathogenic bacteria derived from Sub-Saharan Africa and tested the potential of this technology to discriminate S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) from other serovars. Among blood culture isolates obtained from a study population suffering from febrile illness in Ghana, no major misidentifications were observed for the species identification process, but serovars of Salmonella enterica could not be distinguished using the commercially available Biotyper database. However, a detailed analysis of the mass spectra revealed several serovar-specific biomarker ions, allowing the discrimination of S. Typhi from others. In conclusion, ICMS is able to identify isolates from a sub-Saharan context and may facilitate the rapid discrimination of the clinically and epidemiologically important serovar S. Typhi and other non-S. Typhi serovars in future implementations."

Analysis of the pretreatment Widal agglutination titres of all patients revealed that using as a diagnostic criterion an antibody titre of greater than or equal to 1:80 to the O antigen of Salmonella typhi yielded a test specificity of 100%, although the corresponding sensitivity was only 64%. The sensitivity of the test could be increased to 80% by using different cut-off values for titres to flagellar antigens, but this concomitantly decreased the test specificity from 100 to 82%.

Soxhlet and sonication extractions were also evaluated for their abilities to recover the adsorbed organics from the adsorbents, by measurements of TOX, chromatographable compounds and mutagenicity in the eluates. Soxhlet extraction gave higher recoveries than sonication, as measured with the above indices, but these differences were generally small (ca. 20%), with exception of the carbon extracts.

The working hypothesis was that if the parasite-host relationships were similar for these two agents the immune response, as measured by the Widal test, should be similar. An association between test response and etiology was found consisting of a significantly higher proportion of positive response, in cases due to S. paratyphi B as compared with those due to S. typhi, (OR = 2.13; 95 Cl% = 1.06, 4.32; p = 0.02). Stratified analysis showed that although the association between etiologic agent and Widal test response persisted within all strata, significant interactions could be shown as evidenced by the magnitude of the associations, which varied according to blood phenotypes as well as gender (Mantel-Haenszel test for heterogeneity for 0, p < 0.034; for RH5 p < 0.033; for SS, ss p < 0.056; and gender p < 0.033).

However, various patient sera revealed elevated titers of O-agglutinins against several of the 20 O-antigens of S. marcescens, in a particular O-antigens, O1, O3, O4, O5, O7, O8, O10, O11, O16, O17, O18, O19, and O20. Rabbit anti-Shigella serogroup B immune serum cross-reacted with S. marcescens O-antigens O1 and O10; anti-Shigella serogroup C serum cross-reacted weakly with S. marcescens O-antigen O8. Conversely, rabbit anti-S. marcescens O1 and O10 immune sera cross-reacted with a clinical isolate of Shigella flexneri.

CD008892,0,16893173,0,Increases in calmodulin abundance and stabilization of activated inducible nitric oxide synthase mediate bacterial killing in RAW 264.7 macrophages.,"The rapid activation of macrophages in response to bacterial antigens is central to the innate immune system that permits the recognition and killing of pathogens to limit infection. To understand regulatory mechanisms underlying macrophage activation, we have investigated changes in the abundance of calmodulin (CaM) and iNOS in response to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using RAW 264.7 macrophages. Critical to these measurements was the ability to differentiate free iNOS from the CaM-bound (active) form of iNOS associated with nitric oxide generation. We observe a rapid 2-fold increase in CaM abundance during the first 30 min that is blocked by inhibition of either NFkappaB nuclear translocation or protein synthesis. A similar 2-fold increase in the abundance of the complex between CaM and iNOS is observed with the same time dependence. In contrast, there are no detectable increases in the CaM-free (i.e., inactive) form of iNOS within the first 2 h; it remains at a very low abundance during the initial phase of macrophage activation. Increasing cellular CaM levels in stably transfected macrophages results in a corresponding increase in the abundance of the CaM/iNOS complex that promotes effective bacterial killing following infection by Salmonella typhimurium. Thus, LPS-dependent increases in CaM abundance function in the stabilization and activation of iNOS on the rapid time scale associated with macrophage activation and bacterial killing. These results explain how CaM and iNOS coordinately function to form a stable complex that is part of a rapid host response that functions within the first 30 min following bacterial infection to upregulate the innate immune system involving macrophage activation."

In this study, an industrial sludge containing explosives and pharmaceutical residues was therefore treated in artificial reed beds and the change in toxicity was studied. Nitroaromatic compounds, which are the main ingredients of many pharmaceuticals and explosives, are well known to cause cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Recently performed studies have also showed that embryos of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are sensitive to nitroaromatic compounds. Therefore, we tested the sludge passing through constructed wetlands in order to detect any changes in levels of embryotoxicity, genotoxicity and dioxin-like activity (AhR-agonists).

This retrospective descriptive study covered all the children from 0 to 15 years old seen over a period of 7 years in any hospital department with suspected bacteriemia and for whom the bacteriology laboratory performed a blood culture. During the study period, the laboratory received 842 requests for blood cultures and found 154 (18.3%) of them to be positive. Files for 81 of the 154 patients could be found and examined. The distribution according to age showed septicemia was most frequent among those aged 6-15 years (61.7% of the cases). Microbial identification showed the dominant species to be Salmonella enterica (serovars paratyphi and typhi) (58%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (12.3%). The salmonella isolates had a high rate of resistance to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole. Staphylococci were always sensitive to the antibiotics with which they were tested, although to a lesser extent for penicillin G. All patients routinely received antibiotic treatment, and 81.5% (n=66) were cured (5 children died and 10 left the hospital against medical advice). This study shows that the bacterial epidemiology of septicemia in our setting is dominated by salmonella. Trends in bacterial resistance to antibiotics showed that common antibiotics such as amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole are no longer acceptable as probabilist therapy here. They should be replaced in this type of infection by injectable third generation cephalosporin alone or combined with aminoglycosides."

The Widal test method gave a lower sensitivity (81.3%) than specificity (93%) when compared to the culture of blood for diagnosis of typhoid. Going by the reports of typhoid outbreaks in Embu and Nairobi (ca. 20-25% reported prevalence) we conclude that there has been over-reporting probably due to poor methodologies of performing the Widal test. We recommend adequate clinical examination in suspected cases of typhoid in addition to proper Widal in order to improve typhoid diagnosis. Newer improved methods that are more specific and sensitive than the Widal test need to be evaluated in improving laboratory diagnosis of typhoid."

The structure of the LPS O-polysaccharide (O-PS) from S. Pullorum standard, intermediate and variant antigenic type strains was determined by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and chemical analysis. The LPS of the three strains shared a common structural repeating oligosaccharide unit containing d-mannose, l-rhamnose, d-galactose and d-tyvelose (1:1:1:1). The O-PS of the variant type LPS contained an additional d-glucose residue linked to the O-4 position of the d-galactose residue. The O-PS of the intermediate type LPS was partially the same as that of the variant LPS, however, the molar ratio of the d-glucose component was lower with respect to the other glycose components. Serological specificities of the three antigenic type LPSs were examined with anti-S. Pullorum LPS monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). On immunoblots, Mabs to the standard type O-PS reacted with high molecular mass (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM) LPS from the standard strain, and with LMM but not HMM LPS from the variant strain. Monoclonal antibodies to the variant type O-PS reacted with HMM but not LMM LPS from the variant strain, and did not react with HMM or LMM LPS from the standard strain. On ELISA, the standard, intermediate and variant antigenic type strains were differentiated by the relative reactivity with the anti-LPS O-PS Mabs. Several of the anti-LPS O-PS Mabs were specific for S. Pullorum and other serogroup D1 Salmonella, and are potentially useful for the development of improved diagnostic tests for these organisms."

This association was initially demonstrated in the United States, but has more recently been found in Kenyan patients. This prompted us to review the cases of patients with enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia admitted to Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare. Non-typhoidal salmonella bacteraemia as compared with typhoid fever was significantly more common in HIV infected patients than in non-HIV infected patients (p < 0.01).

Of 207 patients bacteremic with Salmonella Typhi who were ≥ 5 years of age, we identified 43 (21%) patients with encephalopathy. Univariate analysis revealed that patients with encephalopathy more often presented at ages of 10-24 years and had severe dehydration, low oxygen saturation, high respiratory rate, low leukocyte count, low platelet count, and Widal flagellar H agglutinin (TH) titer ≥ 1:640 compared with typhoid patients without encephalopathy. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression showed that age, dehydration, leukocyte count, and Widal TH titer were independently associated with encephalopathy. Our findings suggest that age, severity of disease, and immune responses are associated with encephalopathy during Salmonella Typhi bacteremia, perhaps reflecting the impact of prominent inflammatory responses."
CD008892,0,8635831,0,An outbreak of multidrug resistant. Salmonella typhimurium in a nursery.,"A nursery epidemic caused by multidrug resistant Salmonella typhimurium is reported. In total, 21 infants developed symptomatic illness; of these, 17 had septicemia (7 blood culture positive) and 4 had diarrhea alone. Asymptomatic carrier state was identified in 13 infants. Male sex and birth asphyxia increased the risk for symptomatic illness. Fever, lethargy, and diarrhea were the most common clinical features. Amongst the septicemic infants there was no difference in clinical profile whether the blood culture was positive or negative for S. typhimurium. In the symptomatic group, S. typhimurium was isolated from feces in 19 cases and from blood in 7 cases. In both symptomatic and asymptomatic infants, all isolates of S. typhimurium, whether obtained from feces and/or from blood, were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim, and a significant number (almost one-fifth) of them also showed resistance to third generation cephalosporins. More than 90% of isolates were sensitive to aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. On a combination of third generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) and amikacin, 17 (81%) infants recovered, 2 succumbed to their illness, and 2 failed to improve and required ciprofloxacin. The origin of epidemic was traced to a carrier staff nurse working in nursery."

Twenty two (73.3%) out of thirty typhoid fever cases had either an 'O' or 'H' agglutinin titer of more than or equal to 1:160 as compared to only 3 (3%) among controls. An 'O' agglutinin titer of 1:160 had a specificity of 97%, a sensitivity of 70% and an accuracy of 90%. An 'H' agglutinin in titer of 1:160 was had a specificity of 97%, a sensitivity of 30% and an accuracy of 83.1%. Based on the above analysis, 'O' or 'H' titers of 1:160 or more were indicative of typhoid fever. Similarly, when the 2 titers were considered together, either 'O' or 'H' titers of 1:160 or more were suggestive."

Typhoid fever is endemic elsewhere in the Philippines (eg Metropolitan Manila and surroundings) where also multidrug resistant S. typhi strains have been detected. A laboratory for surveillance of invasive bacterial infections was established in a tertiary care government hospital, in Bohol, Central Philippines, in 1994. Patients with suspected typhoid fever or other serious infection were managed and blood cultures from them were taken according to clinicians' judgment. Blood cultures were processed and the isolated bacteria identified using generally accepted methods. S. typhi and other Salmonella isolates were identified using commercial antisera. Patient data were collected from hospital records. Of a total of 4,699 blood cultures done during a period of 3 3/4 years, 1,530 (32%) were requested for suspected typhoid fever. S. typhi was the most common pathogen isolated from 422 patients (8.9%), followed by S. paratyphi A from 55 patients (1%). Most patients were young adults (43%) and school age children (28%). Male:female ratio was 1.5:1. Among the 422 patients, there were 9 (2%) deaths due to typhoid fever, all with complications. All S. typhi isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, and ampicillin. Our observation on blood culture confirmed typhoid fever demonstrates its importance as a major infectious disease in Bohol and gives a sound basis for treatment of typhoid patients and for further clinical and epidemiologic studies of typhoid fever and for following antibiotic sensitivity of S. typhi in Bohol and elsewhere in the Philippines."

However, it exhibited a substantially weaker reaction with sera from normal donors and patients with acute nontyphoid salmonelloses, than Vi-antigen preparations with a higher (0.8-1.2%) LPS content. The chromatographically pure Vi-antigen was purified by triple reprecipitation with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. The content of the LPS admixture in the resulting Vi-antigen samples was quantitatively determined by GC.

The level of antibody concentration in the SPRIA reflects roughly cross-reactivity between the antigens. Similar antibody binding occurred with M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. ulcerans and several ""atyical"" mycobacteria as test antigens, while other mycobacterial species and one of two tested tuberculin preparation (PPD) showed less antibody binding capacity. Significant cross-reactivity of fourty to sixty per cent was found between M. tuberculosis and N. asteroides but no cross-reaction was observed with C. parvum, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, C. Albicans or Aspergillus niger. Heating of mycobacterial cytoplasmic antigen resulted in a decrease of the test specifity. Tuberculin testing and intracutaneous BCG-vaccination in healthy adults had no distinct influence on the antibody response against several mycobacterial test antigens. However, a rapid increase of antibody levels was documented in melanoma patients after BCG-immunotherapy by sacrification with a more concentrated vaccine."

Anti-Salmonella typhi LPS ELISA was therefore compared to Widal agglutination for serodiagnosis of typhoid fever in paediatric patients. Sera from 38 paediatric control individuals were ELISA negative for anti-S. typhi LPS IgG; all but 2 of these specimens were negative for anti-S. typhi LPS IgM. Paediatric patients hospitalized with signs and symptoms of typhoid fever were separated into 4 groups and tested by ELISA with the following results: 46 patients negative by both culture and Widal agglutination tests, 48% positive for anti-S. typhi LPS IgG and 35% for anti-S. typhi LPS IgM; 22 negative by culture but with positive Widal titres, 82% and 68% positive respectively; 28 culture positive for S. typhi, 93% and 82% respectively; and 12 culture positive for Salmonella other than S. typhi, 92% and 92% respectively.

CD008892,0,2846631,0,Rapid chemiluminescent nucleic acid assays for detection of TEM-1 beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and other bacteria.,"Two new assays for the detection of TEM-1 beta-lactamase-mediated bacterial penicillin resistance were developed that involve the use of specific nucleic acid hybridization. Both techniques are based on a solution-phase hybridization of oligonucleotide probes to the target DNA sequence, solid-phase capture of the probe-target complex, and an amplified chemiluminescent labeling method. One configuration of hybridization probes detected the presence of TEM-1 in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (45 strains), Haemophilus spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Salmonella typhi. A second configuration (TEM-1NH) detected TEM-1 beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance only in N. gonorrhoeae (97 strains) and Haemophilus (6 strains) isolates in which TEM-1 is inserted in a pFA7-type plasmid. Both methods were 100 times more sensitive than a commercially available colorimetric beta-lactamase activity test and approximately 5 times more sensitive than radioisotopic dot blot screening for the gene.

CD008892,0,18287294,0,The TUBEX test detects not only typhoid-specific antibodies but also soluble antigens and whole bacteria.,"TUBEX (IDL Biotech) is a 5 min semiquantitative colorimetric test for typhoid fever, a widely endemic disease. TUBEX detects anti-Salmonella O9 antibodies from a patient's serum by the ability of these antibodies to inhibit the binding between an indicator antibody-bound particle and a magnetic antigen-bound particle. Herein, we report that TUBEX could also be used to specifically detect soluble O9 lipopolysaccharide in antigen-spiked buffer by the ability of the antigen to inhibit the same binding between the particles. Sensitivity of antigen detection was improved (8-31 mug ml(-1)) by using a modified protocol in which the test sample was mixed with the indicator particles first, rather than with the magnetic particles as for antibody detection. The antigen was also detectable in spiked serum and urine samples, albeit less well (2-4-fold) than in buffer generally. However, no antigen was detected from six typhoid sera examined, all of which had anti-O9 antibodies. In addition, whole organisms of Salmonella Typhi (15 strains) and Salmonella Enteritidis (6 strains) (both O9(+) Salmonella), grown in simulated blood broths or on MacConkey agar, were also detectable by TUBEX when suspended at >9 x 10(8) organisms ml(-1). Expectedly, Salmonella Paratyphi A (7 strains), Salmonella Typhimurium (1 strain) and Escherichia coli (2 strains) were negative in the test. Thus, the same TUBEX kit may be used in several ways both serologically and microbiologically for the rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever.

Solid phase concentration procedures were applied to facilitate the study of organic micro pollutants. A chemical analysis was performed by GC/MS. Organic fraction toxicity was determined by using bioassays such as Daphnia magna and Chlorella vulgaris tests and sub-lethal effects were also evaluated by using Salmonella typhimurium Test (mutagenicity), recombinant yeast screen (estrogenicity), and Oryzias latipes embryo-larval test. More than 49 compounds were detected in the organic fraction due to the various inputs of each effluents. The most frequently detected compounds in the effluents were bisphenol A (BPA), octylphenol (OP), 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester (DEHP) and 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(methylpropyl) ester (DBP). Biological assays showed toxicity effects on D. magna tests in all samples, whereas toxicity on C. vulgaris or S. typhimurium tests were not observed. Estrogenicity and teratogenicity were observed in several samples. The cause-effect relationship could not be established given the high chemical complexity of the effluents and the lack of information available on 70% of the detected compounds subsequent to reviewing various data bases. Nevertheless, due to the high chemical variability revealed by STP effluents, bioassay sets may provide a very useful amount of information for detecting potential toxicity risks."

Most of the bacteria were killed and degraded quite soon after infection of the cells, but there were still live bacteria inside the cells for up to 14 days. These results suggest that in patients developing reactive arthritis the salmonellae could persist in the epithelial cells and spread within the host to the joint and be present there at the time of the inflammatory response. Production of marked amounts of nitric oxide was observed as a novel response to salmonella infection in human intestinal epithelial cells. The present experimental procedure appears to be a suitable model to further investigate host-bacteria interaction in HLA-B27 positive cells from patients developing reactive arthritis."

Of 37 eligible children, eight had enteric fever and 29 had non-typhoidal salmonellosis. Salmonella typhimurium was the most common serotype in the group with non-typhoidal salmonellosis. No significant differences were found between the enteric fever and non-typhoidal salmonellosis groups with regard to clinical features, laboratory findings and outcome, except in mean platelet counts and mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. In vitro resistance rates of Salmonella strains were low. Outcome was excellent in all but one child with hydrocephalus and gross neurological sequelae owing to meningitis.

Period before surgical treatment: The longer the time interval between perforation and surgery, the worse is the prognosis. Serology: Patients giving a negative Widal result and showing a high 'H' antigen titre are more likely to survive. Size of perforation: A patient who has a perforation larger than 10 mm in diameter appears to have a poor chance of survival, but this is not statistically significant. Type of surgery: Resection of the ileum with end to end anastomosis apparently gives the best prognosis, and simple closure of the perforation seems the next best.

This method allows Salmonella subspecies to be distinguished but does not allow serotypes and phage types to be distinguished. The objective of this study was to determine the relatedness of isolates belonging to distinct Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotypes by using a refined biotyping process that considers the kinetics at which biochemical reactions take place. Using a Vitek GNI+ card for the identification of gram-negative organisms, we determined the biochemical kinetic reactions (28 biochemical tests) of 135 Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica strains of pig origin collected in Spain from 1997 to 2002 (59 Salmonella serotype Typhimurium strains, 25 Salmonella serotype Typhimurium monophasic variant strains, 25 Salmonella serotype Anatum strains, 12 Salmonella serotype Tilburg strains, 7 Salmonella serotype Virchow strains, 6 Salmonella serotype Choleraesuis strains, and 1 Salmonella enterica serotype 4,5,12:-:- strain). The results were expressed as the colorimetric and turbidimetric changes (in percent) and were used to enhance the classical biotype profile by adding kinetic categories. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed by using the enhanced profiles and resulted in 14 clusters. Six major clusters grouped 94% of all isolates with a similarity of > or =95% within any given cluster, and eight clusters contained a single isolate. The six major clusters grouped not only serotypes of the same type but also phenotypic serotype variations into individual clusters. This suggests that metabolic kinetic reaction data from the biochemical tests commonly used for classic Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica biotyping can possibly be used to determine the relatedness between isolates in an easy and timely manner."

The oligonucleotide sequence covering the epitope recognized by SRT10 was inserted into a mammalian expression vector together with multiple cloning sites. When the SRTag was fused in frame to the coding region of the NCC27/CLIC1 gene and expressed in mammalian cells, the MAb SRT10 could detect the tagged protein by immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation. In addition to the SRT-NCC27/CLIC1, SRT10 could detect N-terminal-tagged MEF2D and C-terminal-tagged CD4 by immunocytochemistry. We suggest that this specific recognition of the SRTag by SRT10 is generally applicable to cellular and molecular biology research that requires the expression and detection of fusion proteins."

Most isolates were sensitive to fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, perfloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) except Acinetobacter that was 100% resistant to both groups of antibiotics. Gram positive isolates were resistant to the second generation cephalosporin, cefuroxime. We hereby recommend the use of combination of a third generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolones where not contraindicated, in the empiric treatment of septicaemia before sensitivity results are available."

CD008892,0,1681365,0,Oral immunisation against typhoid fever in Indonesia with Ty21a vaccine.,"When tested under conditions of moderate transmission of typhoid fever, a liquid formulation of the oral typhoid fever vaccine Ty21a had a protective efficacy of 96% in Egypt, and an enteric coated capsule formulation had an efficacy of 67% in Chile. We compared the two formulations under conditions of intense transmission of typhoid fever in Indonesia in a randomised, double-blind trial. 20,543 subjects (age range 3-44 years) received either three doses of enteric coated capsules containing placebo or live Ty21a, or three doses of lyophilised placebo or live Ty21a reconstituted with phosphate buffer. During 30 months of follow-up, the rate of blood-culture-positive typhoid fever among controls was 810/100,000 per year. Rates of typhoid fever were 379/100,000 per year for subjects who received the liquid formulation of vaccine and 468/100,000 per year for subjects who received enteric coated capsules. The protective efficacies of the liquid and enteric coated formulations were 53% and 42%, respectively. Neither formulation protected against infection with Salmonella paratyphi A. No major side-effects were noted, but the overall incidence of side-effects was greater in the vaccine groups. Under conditions of intense transmission, Ty21a protected against typhoid fever; however, because Ty21a will not protect all individuals, there is a need for additional approaches to prevent the disease."
CD008892,0,11699718,0,Validation of salmonellosis and shigellosis diagnostic test kits at a provincial hospital in Thailand.,"Rapid Diagnosis of salmonellosis and shigellosis was performed using six different diagnostic test kits which recently have been made available commercially. They were Salmo-Dot, Typhi-Dot, Shigel Dot A, B, C, and D test kits for detection of Salmonella spp., group D salmonellae, and groups A, B, C, and D Shigella spp., respectively. The principle of all test kits is a membrane (dot) ELISA using specific monoclonal antibodies to the respective pathogens as the detection reagents. The present study was designed to validate the accuracy of the test kits, at a laboratory in a provincial hospital in Thailand, in comparison with the conventional bacterial culture method alone or with the combined results of the culture and the Western blot analysis (WB) for detecting the respective bacterial lipopolysacchharides (LPS) in specimens. Five hundred rectal swab samples of patients with diarrhea who seeked treatment at the hospital, were evaluated. The diagnostic accuracy of the Salmo-Dot was 91.0% when compared with the conventional bacterial culture method alone but was 100.0% in comparison with the combined results of the culture and the WB. The Typhi-Dot and the Shigel-Dot A, B, C, and D showed 100%, 99.2%, 95.0%, 94.0% and 96.4%, respectively when compared with the culture alone and all were 100% in comparison with the combination of the results of the bacterial culture and the WB. The Shigel-Dot A revealed antigen of type 1 Shigella dysenteriae in several specimens in which the bacteria could not be recovered by the culture method. This difference is important as type 1 Shigella dysenteriae have high epidemic potential and often cause severe morbidity. Unawareness of their presence by the conventional culture may have great impact on disease surveillance for public health. The pathogen detection using the six diagnostic test kits is sensitive, specific, rapid, and relatively simple and less expensive. Several specimens can be tested at the same time without much increase in turn around time. Moreover, these kits produce no contaminated waste as compared with the bacterial culture method. The test kits should be used for rapid screening of specimens of patients with diarrhea especially in areas where culture facilities are inadequate."

Although serological status was significantly associated with bacteriological prevalence of salmonella enterica in swine herds, the association was clarified by adding information on the change in serological status over time and the age group being tested. Salmonella infection assessed by serological tests at a single time-point and data on age group tested would allow better targeting and managing control programs."

We report an outbreak of enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi in a suburban area, in city Chandigarh of North India. Twenty-seven strains of S. typhi were isolated from blood cultures over a period of two weeks with 18 of these 27 patients residing in the same area. Maximum cases were in the age group 5-14 years (10 patients, 55.5%) while 4 (22.2%) cases were children under 5 years. All the strains showed similar resistogram being resistant to ampicillin and nalidixic acid, intermediate to ciprofloxacin and sensitive to chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole and azithromycin on disc diffusion testing. Minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin was determined by agar dilution method and was found to be raised (≥ 2 μ g/mL).

We developed a rapid and simple test for detecting E. coli O157:H7 using a method based on restriction site polymorphisms. Restriction-site-specific PCR (RSS-PCR) involves the amplification of DNA fragments using primers based on specific restriction enzyme recognition sequences, without the use of endonucleases, to generate a set of amplicons that yield ""fingerprint"" patterns when resolved electrophoretically on an agarose gel. The method was evaluated in a blinded study of E. coli isolates obtained from environmental samples collected at beef cattle feedyards. The 54 isolates were all initially identified by a commonly used polyclonal antibody test as belonging to O157:H7 serotype. They were retested by anti-O157 and anti-H7 monoclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The RSS-PCR method identified all 28 isolates that were shown to be E. coli O157:H7 by the monoclonal antibody ELISA as belonging to the O157:H7 serotype. Of the remaining 26 ELISA-confirmed non-O157:H7 strains, the method classified 25 strains as non-O157:H7. The specificity of the RSS-PCR results correlated better with the monoclonal antibody ELISA than with the polyclonal antibody latex agglutination tests. The RSS-PCR method may be a useful test to distinguish E. coli O157:H7 from a large number of E. coli isolates from environmental samples."

To overcome these limitations, we designed a ready-to-use PCR test for Salmonella typhi using PCR reagents, primers against the ST50 gene of S. typhi, a built-in internal amplification control (IAC), and gel loading dye mixed and freeze-dried in a single tube. The 2-step dry-reagent-based assay was used to amplify a 1238-bp target gene and an 810-bp IAC gene from 73 BACTEC blood culture broths (33 true positives for S. typhi and 40 true negatives for non-S. typhi). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the PCR assay were 87.9%, 100%, 100%, and 90.9%, respectively. We suggest that this rapid 2-step PCR test could be used for the rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever."

We report here the isolation of a new serotype: Salmonella Libreville and the emergence of Salmonella Wien which was unknown in Libreville area. Lysotyping of S. typhi shows that three strains of A lysotype, subtype Dakar, were not indigenous. Infection by Salmonellae is still widespread among Gabonese children. Scarcity of those germs in stool could be explained by intensive antibiotherapy; on the other hand more than 50% of germs isolated from blood culture in children at Libreville area are Salmonellae.

We report the case of a 4-year-old Lebanese boy who presented with high-grade fever of long duration, and a single (unpaired) positive Widal agglutination test. Blood culture was negative. A diagnosis of typhoid fever was made. An abdominal (mesenteric) IMT was incidentally discovered, 30 days after the fever had appeared. After surgery, the fever disappeared immediately, and the ESR returned to normal. We strongly favor the possibility of a false positive Widal test, due to polyclonal increase in serum immunoglobulins, which often occurs in IMT. We also think that IMT might be a mimicker of typhoid fever, both clinically and serologically. Physicians, especially pediatricians practicing in endemic areas, should probably be aware of this mimicry."

The samples were processed based on an unpaired test design that included enrichment in buffered peptone water for the candidate method and lactose broth for the reference method. In the candidate method, a 1 mL aliquot of enriched sample was extracted using PrepMan Ultra Sample Preparation Reagent; the sample was amplified on the Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system, and analyzed for detection of Salmonella using RapidFinder Version 1.0 software. All samples processed by the candidate method were confirmed by culture according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Bacteriological Analytical Manual procedures.

The Salmonella-seeded samples remained at room temperature for 14 days before analysis to stabilize the Salmonella in the food environment. Twenty 25 g test portions from each seeded level and five 25 g samples of uninoculated control samples were processed using enrichment broths as outlined in the FDA-BAM procedure. BBL CHROMagar Salmonella-prepared plates were evaluated with the FDA reference method media (bismuth sulfite, xylose lysine desoxycholate, and Hektoen enteric agars). Fractionally positive results were obtained from the lower inoculum level of peanut butter samples. Five positive cultures were recovered from both the BBL CHROMagar Salmonella and reference methods. The two methods gave identical results for all cultures resulting in a method agreement of 100%. McNemar's chi2 test, which assesses the evidence for difference in marginal proportions between two methods, could not be evaluated because it requires one or more discrepant cultures. However, because there were no discrepant cultures, the marginal proportions for the two methods were identical; therefore, there is no evidence of a difference between the methods. This study demonstrates that the results from BBL CHROMagar Salmonella are comparable to the three reference method media for the detection of Salmonella in peanut butter using the FDA-BAM procedures."

We conducted a phase 2 trial in which 80 healthy adults received one of two dosage levels of CVD 908-htrA in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. There were no differences in the rates of side effects among volunteers who received high-dose vaccine (4.5 x 10(8) CFU), lower-dose vaccine (5 x 10(7) CFU), or placebo in the 21 days after vaccination, although recipients of high-dose vaccine (8%) had more frequent diarrhea than placebo recipients (0%) in the first 7 days. Seventy-seven percent and 46% of recipients of high- and lower-dose vaccines, respectively, briefly excreted vaccine organisms in their stools. All blood cultures were negative. Antibody-secreting cells producing antilipopolysaccharide (LPS) immunoglobulin A (IgA) were detected in 100 and 92% of recipients of high- and lower-dose vaccines, respectively. Almost half the volunteers developed serum anti-LPS IgG. Lymphocyte proliferation and gamma interferon production against serovar Typhi antigens occurred in a significant proportion of vaccinees. This phase 2 study supports the further development of CVD 908-htrA as a single-dose vaccine against typhoid fever and as a possible live vector for oral delivery of other vaccine antigens."

CD008892,0,1787792,0,"A chimeric nucleotide-binding protein, encoded by a hisP-malK hybrid gene, is functional in maltose transport in Salmonella typhimurium.","We have isolated a hybrid gene, composed of the first 455 nucleotides of hisP and nucleotides 275-1107 of malK, the genes coding for the nucleotide-binding components of the high-affinity transport systems for histidine and maltose in Salmonella typhimurium, respectively. The fusion had occurred by recombination within 11 homologous base pairs located between the two DNA fragments. In the chimeric protein peptidic motifs A and B, proposed to be part of the nucleotide-binding fold, originate from HisP and MalK, respectively. Plasmid pES42-39, harbouring the hybrid gene, was shown to complement only a malK mutation but failed to complement a hisP deletion mutation. The chimeric protein was identified by immunoblotting as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 49kDa. Removal of the C-terminal 77 amino acid residues from the chimeric protein resulted in the loss of function in transport. In contrast, 51 amino acid residues could be removed from the C-terminus of wild-type MalK without any effect.

Based on these results, a tentative model of the functional domains of MalK is presented."

He presented with lumbar back pain associated with fever and rigours, which had been preceded by diarrhoea. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis. An MRI scan of his pelvis and spine showed that he had a small gluteal abscess and sacroiliitis. His condition subsequently deteriorated due to the development of a secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Detailed investigations did not reveal any predisposing factors or evidence of an underlying immunodeficiency. Follow-up showed complete resolution of symptoms with no long-term sequelae."
CD008892,0,8815085,0,Development and application of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for specific detection of Salmonella enteritidis infections in chickens based on antibodies to SEF14 fimbrial antigen.,"A double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect antibodies to the SEF14 fimbrial antigen (SEF14-DAS ELISA) and was evaluated for its use in the specific detection of chicken flocks infected with Salmonella enteritidis. The SEF14-DAS ELISA successfully discriminated between chickens experimentally infected with S. enteritidis and those infected with S. panama or S. typhimurium, although the SEF14 responses in adult birds infected with S. enteritidis were detectable but low. In contrast, ELISAs used to detect antibodies to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagella were unable to discriminate between the infected groups of chicks and adult birds infected with different Salmonella serotypes. LPS and flagellar responses were low and variable in chicks, whereas in adult hens they were found to be consistently strong. When flocks naturally infected with S. enteritidis were tested by the SEF14-DAS ELISA and ELISAs to detect LPS and flagellar antibodies, it was found that they could all identify the infected flocks, although there was little correlation between individual serum samples. The study shows that the SEF14-DAS ELISA may offer advantages over existing assays with comparable sensitivities coupled with higher specificities for the serological detection of S. enteritidis-infected chicken flocks."

Vaccination of 11,384 children was followed by 21 months' surveillance. 47 blood-culture-proven cases of typhoid occurred in children who received meningococcal A + C CPS vaccine and 19 cases in those vaccinated with Vi CPS. Protective efficacy was 60% calculated from the day of vaccination and 64% from 6 weeks after vaccination. Surveillance also included 11,691 unvaccinated children; 173 cases occurred in this group. Protective efficacy in relation to the unvaccinated group was 77.4% and 81.0% after 21 months, calculated immediately and 6 weeks after vaccination, respectively. Vaccination was associated with minimum local side-effects, and an increase in anti-Vi antibodies occurred, as measured by radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody levels remained significantly raised at 6 and 12 months post vaccination. Vi CPS is thus a safe and effective means of typhoid vaccination."

He had been working as a crew member of a ship in South East Asia. Salmonella typhi was isolated from his blood culture. In the course of the disease, intestinal hemorrhage, drug-induced fever and liver dysfunction, DIC, ARDS, and psychiatric disorder were identified. Intestinal hemorrhage occurred after the coagulation test became normal, so it was thought that the intestinal hemorrhage did not correlate with DIC. The patient was treated with CP, ABPC and supportive therapy. He became well, and ARDS and psychiatric disorder were disappeared. He was discharged on the 118th day of illness. Drug-induced fever was thought as one of the allergic reaction and the causative drug was not identified by LST. It was suspected that psychiatric disorder correlated with poor nutrition.

The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies to this antigen (SEF14) was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified SEF14, immune electron microscopy and, with 11 monoclonal antibodies, the identification of a repeating protein subunit (14,300kDa) on the antigen. Blocking-ELISA with the monoclonal antibodies identified epitopes in at least three, non-overlapping clusters which appeared evenly distributed on SEF14 in immune electron microscopy. The use of the monoclonal antibodies in direct-binding ELISA on a range of salmonella serotypes suggested that the epitopes on SEF14 are highly conserved and were expressed by all the S enteritidis strains examined; some strains of S dublin and the only strain of S moscow available were the only other serotypes that expressed SEF14. A latex agglutination reagent based on a monoclonal antibody was developed and used to test for SEF14 on 280 strains (representing 120 serotypes in 24 serogroups of salmonellae) that had been grown on Sensitest agar for 18 hours at 37 degrees C. All S enteritidis strains (64) and most S dublin strains (28 of 33) produced SEF14 as did the two strains representing S blegdam and S moscow.

CD008892,0,16490150,0,Emergence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi with decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility in Bangladesh.,"During 1989-2002, we studied the antimicrobial resistance of 3928 blood culture isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Overall 32% (1270) of the strains were multidrug-resistant (MDR, resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole); first detected in 1990 (rate of 8%), increased in 1994 (44%), declined in 1996 (22%, P<0.01 compared to 1994) and re-emerged in 2001 (36%) and 2002 (42%, P<0.01 compared to 1996). An increased MIC of ciprofloxacin (0.25 microg/ml) indicating decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was detected in 24 (18.2%) out of 132 randomly selected strains during 1990-2002; more frequently in MDR than susceptible strains (46.3% vs. 5.5%, P<0.001), and the proportion of them rose to 47% in 2002 from 8% in 2000 (P<0.01). Ciprofloxacin (5 microg) disk diffusion zone diameters of < or =24 mm as break-point had 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity when compared with a ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.25 microg/ml as break-point for decreased susceptibility; being a useful and easy screen test.

Bacteriologic cure was defined as blood cultures testing negative on days 4 and 15 after start of therapy; clinical cure was defined as symptomatic improvement within 5 days after start of therapy and absence of relapse. Clinical and bacteriologic cures occurred in 24 patients. There were two clinical failures, two patients who failed to complete therapy because of leukopenia, and one relapse. Mean levels before therapy were elevated compared with those in healthy controls (IL-6, 11.4 pg/ml; IFN-gamma, 1.3 ng/ml; TNF-R p55, 3.8 ng/ml; and TNF-R p75, 6.1 ng/ml) and fell progressively during and after therapy. For six patients (three in each treatment group) who showed prolonged fever (> 5 days) or relapse, mean levels of IL-6 and TNF-R p55 before therapy (29.5 pg/ml and 6.1 ng/ml, respectively) and on day 4 (17.7 pg/ml and 4.0 ng/ml) were significantly greater than corresponding means for 23 patients who showed early defervescence (on admission, 6.7 pg/ml and 3.3 ng/ml, and on day 4, 1.8 pg/ml and 2.7 ng/ml, P < .05).

Prevalence rates of 11.6%, 11.3% respectively in children and adults of antibodies to B. abortus with reciprocal titers greater than or equal to 80 and similarly 13.1%, 12.4% to B. melitensis were found. The usefulness of a single Widal test to diagnose enteric fever in a non-endemic area and the agglutination test in the diagnosis of brucellosis in an endemic area was investigated. Of 244 patients with suspected enteric fever, the sera of 100 showed reciprocal antibody titers 80 to both O and H antigens and included in these were 8 patients with concurrent culture positivity. Among 138 children and adults with suspected brucellosis, 29 culture proven cases where serologically confirmed and a further 90 were detected serologically. The sera of all the culture proven cases exhibited antibody reciprocal titer greater than or equal to 640. A similar antibody response was noted in seventy-two of the culture negative cases diagnosed serologically for brucellosis. In culture proven, cases B. melitensis was the isolate.

This study included 80 children suffering from typhoid fever, among which 40 were confirmed by blood culture isolation and 40 had possible typhoid fever based on high Widal's titre (a four-fold rise in the titre of antibody to typhi ""O"" and ""H"" antigen was considered as a positive Widal's test result). Eighty children, 40 with febrile illness confirmed to be other than typhoid and 40 normal healthy children were used as negative controls. The various groups were: (i) Study group ie, group I had 40 children confirmed by culture isolation of Salmonella typhi(confirmed typhoid cases). (ii) Control groups ie, (a) group II with 40 febrile controls selected from paediatrics ward where cause other than S typhi has been established, (b) group III with 40 afebrile healthy controls that were siblings of the children admitted in paediatric ward for any reason with no history of fever and TAB vaccination in the last one year, and (c) group IV with 40 children with high Widal's titre in paired sera sample. Widal's test with paired sera with a one week interval between collections were done in all 40 patients. Latex aggtutination test which could detect 900 ng/ml of antigen as observed in checker board titration, was positive in all 40 children from group I who had positive blood culture and in 30 children from group IV who had culture negative and had high Widal's titre positive. Latex agglutination test was positive in 4 children in group II and none in group III. Using blood culture positive cases as true positive and children in groups II and III as true negative, the test had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96%. Latex agglutination test was found to be significantly sensitive (100%) and specific (96%) and could detect 75% more cases in group IV (possible typhoid cases). Thus latex agglutination test can be used for rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever though it cannot replace conventional blood culture required for isolation of organism to report the antibiotic sensitivity."

CD008892,0,11198149,0,Neuroretinitis.,"Despite the growing list of agents that can present as neuroretinitis, nearly one-half remain idiopathic. However, many of the candidate etiologies are treatable conditions, and accurate diagnosis can result in visual rehabilitation. A complete workup in patients presenting with acute neuroretinitis should include a thorough history and general medical evaluation. Exposure history should be thoroughly explored, including recent travel, unpasteurized and uncooked foods, sexual experience, and animal contacts. A detailed physical examination should be performed to note hidden rashes and inoculation sites and should include routine measurements of blood pressure and heart rate. Laboratory tests should be tailored to the history and may include complete blood count; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; bacterial, fungal, and viral blood cultures; antinuclear antibody test; angiotensin-converting enzyme; anti-double-stranded DNA; and C3. Serological evaluation should look for syphilis, Lyme disease, histoplasmosis, brucellosis, chlamydia, HIV, toxoplasmosis, Epstein-Barr virus, viral hepatitis B and C, and tuberculin skin test. Neuroretinitis is a clinical entity in which there is inflammation of the retinal architecture and optic nerve. There are numerous entities that can cause a picture of neuroretinitis ranging from vascular to infectious to autoimmune. With regards to the infectious etiologies, it is interesting to note that many of these organisms are obligate intracellular pathogens. The microorganisms B. henselae, T. gondii, R. typhi, T. pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and various viruses, such as HIV, mumps, and HSV, are known intracellular agents. Other major infectious agents, such as B. burgdorferi and Leptospirosis spp. are known to remain sequestered within the circulatory system. It is possible that in this way these agents are able to breach the delicate blood-brain barrier. The implication of such findings on the treatment and management of neuroretinitis remains to be explored. Interestingly, the vast majority of infected patients do not develop neuroretinitis or demonstrate CNS involvement. Detailed examination of this variability may provide further insight into the pathogenic properties of these infectious agents, host tissue susceptibility, and mechanisms of blood-retina barrier integrity. A detailed retinal examination can provide an unobstructed view of the CNS. Careful inspection of this delicate interface may reveal subtle findings critical for accurate and rapid diagnosis of underlying systemic pathology. The varied visual and neurological symptoms of neuroretinitis attest to the fact that this is a disease of both the retina and contiguous neuronal elements. Such involvement significantly elevates the risk to the patient and emphasizes the need for early detection and prompt treatment."

He was found to be HIV-positive and Salmonella Typhimurium was isolated in one blood culture and cervical mass tissue culture. We discuss the relevance of infections by NTS in immunodeficient patients because they present with more severe illness than normal population. We emphasize the importance of NTS bacteremia as a marker of underlying immunodeficiency. We present some localized infection sites reported in the literature and their relation with particular diseases. We discuss the future relevance that an early start of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may have in HIV patients with NTS acute bacteremia or focal infections. Because infections by NTS can be severe and highly lethal they must be considered in the differential diagnosis of causative organisms of localized infections and bacteremia in HIV patients."
CD008892,0,17214195,0,Comparative study between paratyphoid A and typhoid fever cases.,"Twenty eight positive blood culture paratyphoid A fever cases were studied. Forty two positive blood culture typhoid cases were taken as controls. Cases and controls were subjected to: 1) careful history, 2) thorough clinical examination, 3) two blood cultures for salmonella, 4) Widal agglutination test, 5) total and differential white blood count, 6) urine and stool cultures following therapy. There was no significant difference in the clinical picture between acute paratyphoid A fever and acute typhoid fever except the significant decrease of anorexia (57%), toxic look (54%), coated tongue (64%) in acute paratyphoid A cases when compared to acute typhoid cases. The prevalence of extraintestinal symptoms in paratyphoid A cases may mimic viral infections. Three of the 4 classical signs namely; toxic look (54%), bronchitic chest (50%), splenomegaly (72%) and tympanitis (64%) were good bed side suggestive clinical diagnostic aids in paratyphoid A cases. Blood culture was the cornerstone of diagnosis of paratyphoid A cases. In 6 (21%), only the second blood sample was positive stressing the value of multiple cultures. Significant Widal antibody titre was elicited in only about half (57%) of paratyphoid A cases which was significantly lower than typhoid cases (83%). Leucopenia was found in only 25% of paratyphoid A cases. Eosinopenia was constant and is considered as a diagnostic and prognostic aid. No correlation was elicited between either the height of antibody titre or the height of leucocytic count and the severity of illness. There was no significant difference in the response to therapy or the occurrence of complications between paratyphoid A cases and typhoid cases. Up to the current knowledge, this is the first report on comparative study between acute paratyphoid A fever and acute typhoid fever in Egypt from clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic points of view."

The latex assay is very easy to use, gives a rapid result and may be used as a point-of-care diagnostic test. For acute phase samples collected on average 6 days after the onset of illness, the sensitivity is 42.5% for culture-confirmed patients with typhoid fever and the specificity is 96.9%. The sensitivity improved with the duration of illness from 30.8% for samples collected during the first 4-5 days of illness to 45.5% for samples collected between days 7 and 9, and to 84.6% for the samples collected more than 9 days after the onset of illness.

CD008892,0,7810382,0,Re-evaluation of the Widal agglutination test in response to the changing pattern of typhoid fever in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.,"In 1992 it was decided to re-evaluate the Widal slide agglutination test as a rapid diagnostic test for typhoid fever in Papua New Guinea. This was in response to an apparent increase in the number of false positive Widal slide agglutinations occurring using an O cut-off titre greater than or equal to 40 which was previously shown to be appropriate in 1987. The results of the re-evaluation indicated that the Widal test using a diagnostic cut-off titre of > or = 40 lacked specificity and was no longer appropriate for this population. A new O antibody titre of > or = 160 was recommended as a diagnostic titre for typhoid fever in PNG. The fall in the specificity of the Widal slide agglutination test over the five-year period between the initial assessment and the re-evaluation is due to an increase in general population antibody levels caused by the changing pattern of typhoid in the community. Before 1987 typhoid fever occurred as sporadic, isolated outbreaks and most people living in the highlands of PNG were immunologically naive. By 1992 typhoid fever had become a well-established endemic disease and many more people had been exposed to Salmonella typhi and as a result developed antibodies. We have been able to demonstrate clearly a remarkable change in the immune status of the community, in which the proportion of healthy individuals with a Widal tube O agglutination titre of 40 or more rose from 0 to 56% in the short span of five years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The flow assay for typhoid fever is based on the detection of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi lipopolysaccharide-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. The assay was evaluated on serum samples collected in a hospital in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, where typhoid fever is endemic, and the results were compared with culture and Widal test. The sensitivity of this typhoid fever IgM flow assay for samples collected at 1st diagnosis from patients with culture-confirmed typhoid fever was determined to be 59.3%. The sensitivity ranged from 41.2% to 89.5%, depending on the duration of illness. A specificity of 97.8% was calculated based on results obtained for patients with clinical suspicion of typhoid fever that was later excluded. The assay is ideal for use as a point-of-care test in health care centers that lack the expertise and facilities to perform culture or the less specific Widal test. Because of its simplicity, the assay may also be used as a field test in remote areas."

This study was conducted in order to delineate the aetiology of AFI that present to a tertiary hospital in southern India and to describe disease-specific clinical profiles. An 1-year prospective, observational study was conducted in adults (age >16 years) who presented with an undifferentiated febrile illness of duration 5-21 days, requiring hospitalization. Blood cultures, malarial parasites and febrile serology (acute and convalescent), in addition to clinical evaluations and basic investigations were performed. Comparisons were made between each disease and the other AFIs. A total of 398 AFI patients were diagnosed with: scrub typhus (47.5%); malaria (17.1%); enteric fever (8.0%); dengue (7.0%); leptospirosis (3.0%); spotted fever rickettsiosis (1.8%); Hantavirus (0.3%); alternate diagnosis (7.3%); and unclear diagnoses (8.0%). Leucocytosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aseptic meningitis, mild serum transaminase elevation and hypoalbuminaemia were independently associated with scrub typhus. Normal leukocyte counts, moderate to severe thrombocytopenia, renal failure, splenomegaly and hyperbilirubinaemia with mildly elevated serum transaminases were associated with malaria. Rash, overt bleeding manifestations, normal to low leukocyte counts, moderate to severe thrombocytopenia and significantly elevated hepatic transaminases were associated with dengue.

The C1 antigen was detected in 8 BC from which only S. oranienburg was later isolated. The COAG test was generally positive at the same time the BC became culture positive. However, because of subculture and biochemical identification requirements the COAG test could be interpreted 1-2 days before culture results were available. The COAG test can be used to presumptively identify Salmonella typhi and Salmonella group C1 in blood cultures before the culture results are available."

We investigated trends in bloodstream infections at an infectious disease hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from 1994-2008. Amongst 66,111 blood cultures performed, a clinically relevant pathogen was isolated in 7645 episodes (positivity rate; 116/1000 cultures). Salmonella Typhi was the predominant pathogen until 2002; however, a considerable annual decline in the proportion of S. Typhi was observed (OR 0.6993, 95% CI [0.6885, 0.7103], p<0.0001). Conversely, there was a significant increase in the proportions of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), Cryptococcus neoformans and Penicillium marneffei, concurrent with increasing HIV prevalence. These data document a substantial longitudinal shift in bloodstream infection etiology in southern Vietnam. We propose such changes are related to increasing economic prosperity and HIV prevalence, and this pattern marks a substantial change in the epidemiology of invasive salmonellosis in Southeast Asia."

The system was found to be 100% accurate when used on 104 clinical specimens that included 13 S. typhi isolates. Enteric fever could thus be diagnosed as early as 1 day after the initiation of culture in some (18%) cases. The latex particles were also used in an experimental situation to detect soluble S. typhi lipopolysaccharide by a tube agglutination method. This was found to be more than four times as sensitive as the conventional slide agglutination method because at least 50 ng of antigen per ml in either buffer or urine was detected, albeit with less efficiency when serum was used."

The sensitivity of determination of specific antibodies to LPS-AG is shown to be 15-160 times as high as that of RPGA and the sensitivity of determination of LPS-AG is comparable to that of solid-phase enzyme immunoassay. The stability and storage of diagnostic immunoliposomal test systems are dealt with. It is shown that the liposomal diagnostic agents can be stable without losing their properties for years. Whether LIA is of diagnostic value in detecting salmonellosis in children in the clinical setting is discussed and the value of this assay is compared with that of other laboratory methods. The data on how LIA can be automated are presented. Its analytical advantages in using in laboratory diagnosis are discussed."
CD008892,0,2295860,0,Production of specific monoclonal antibodies to Salmonella typhi flagellin and possible application to immunodiagnosis of typhoid fever.,"Four murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to Salmonella typhi flagellin were produced. These MAbs did not react with eight other enterobacterial strains tested: Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella paratyphi A, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni. All four MAbs cross-reacted with Salmonella muenchen flagellin indicating specificity for d antigenic flagellar epitope. One MAb (C4) was selected to develop a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect S. typhi flagellin in serum samples. By use of this assay S. typhi flagellar antigen was detected in 95.5% of serum samples from patients with positive hemoculture for S. typhi, in 93.6% of samples from patients with positive serodiagnosis of typhoid fever, in 26% of samples collected from patients who were initially hemoculture-positive for S. typhi and who had undergone 7-8 d of chemotherapy, in 8.5% of samples from healthy persons from an endemic area, and in no samples from healthy persons from a nonendemic area. The presence of high levels of flagellin antibody titers did not interfere with the antigen detection. The detection of S. typhi flagellar antigen in patient serum may have practical value for rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever."

Children with positive blood cultures were treated with cefixime, ceftriaxone or aztreonam, and the efficacy, safety and cost of these regimens were evaluated and compared. Cefixime (7.5 mg/kg) was given orally twice daily to 50 children for 14 days, ceftriaxone (50 to 70 mg/kg) was given im once daily for 5 days to 43 children and aztreonam (50 to 70 mg/kg) was given im every 8 hours for 7 days to 31 children. Children in the 3 groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, duration and severity of illness before admission. All children were cured. A significant difference (P < 0.05) in duration of treatment before becoming afebrile seemed to favor ceftriaxone (3.9 days) over aztreonam (5.5 days) and cefixime (5.3 days). During the 4-week follow-up period relapses occurred in 3 (6%) children in the cefixime group, in 2 (5%) in the ceftriaxone group and in 2 (6%) in the aztreonam group. Safety and efficacy were comparable for all 3 drugs. Ceftriaxone was most cost-effective on an inpatient basis, because of a more rapid clinical cure, and cefixime was the most cost-effective on an outpatient basis, because of drug cost."

While the high prevalence of malaria is an established fact, it is only within the past 5 years that an unusually high number of illnesses have been diagnosed as malaria co-existing with typhoid fever. The Widal test is widely used as the sole laboratory test for the diagnosis of typhoid fever. To investigate the extent of the malaria and typhoid fever association, we used blood and stool cultures as additional diagnostic tests for typhoid fever. We report that, of 200 patients presenting with fever, 17.0% had concurrent malaria and typhoid fever (Salmonella typhi) based on bacteriological proven diagnosis as compared with 47.9% based on the Widal test. A higher proportion of patients (32.5%) had malaria coexisting with S. typhimurium when compared to S. paratyphi (2%) and S. typhi (P < 0.05). We conclude that the number of fever cases diagnosed as malaria co-existing with typhoid fever is overestimated."

We prospectively identified febrile patients from Diyarbakir and the surrounding area who were admitted to hospital. Cases were defined as patients who had S. typhi isolated from at least one blood culture. Sixty-four cases with blood culture-confirmed S. typhi were identified between May 2001 and May 2003. In total, 128 age- and sex-matched controls selected from neighbourhoods as cases were enrolled. We hypothesized that consumption of raw vegetables contaminated with sewage would be associated with an increased risk of typhoid fever. Conditional logistic regression modelling revealed that living in a crowded household (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.58-6.92, P=0.002), eating cig kofte (a traditional raw food) (OR 5.29, 95% CI 2.20-12.69, P=0.000) and lettuce salad (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.52-8.28, P=0.003) in the 15 days prior to symptoms onset was independently associated with typhoid fever.

A medical team of 27 persons (7 nurses, 6 infectious disease residents or fellows, 2 dermatologists, and 12 infectious disease specialists) visited the 2 shelters in Marseilles, France, for 4 consecutive years. Homeless volunteers were interviewed, examined, and received care; and blood was sampled for cell counts and detection of bacteremia, antibodies to louse-borne (Rickettsia prowazekii, Bartonella quintana, and Borrelia recurrentis), flea-borne (R. typhi, R. felis), mite-borne (R. akari), and tick-borne (R. conorii) bacterial agents. We selected sex- and age-adjusted controls among healthy blood donors. Over 4 years, 930 homeless people were enrolled. Lice were found in 22% and were associated with hypereosinophilia (odds ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence intervals, 1.46-22.15). Twenty-seven patients (3%) with scabies were treated with ivermectin. Bartonella quintana was isolated from blood culture in 50 patients (5.3%), 36 of whom were treated effectively. The number of bacteremic patient increased from 3.4% to 8.4% (p = 0.02) over the 4 years of the study. We detected a higher seroprevalence to Borrelia recurrentis, R. conorii, and R. prowazekii antibodies in the homeless. Our study shows a high prevalence of louse-borne infections in the homeless and a high degree of exposure to tick-borne diseases and scabies. Despite effective treatment for Bartonella quintana bacteremia and the efforts made to delouse this population, Bartonella quintana remains endemic, and we found hallmarks of epidemic typhus and relapsing fever. The uncontrolled louse infestation of this population should alert the community to the possibility of severe re-emerging louse-borne infections."

CD008892,0,20303192,0,Evaluation of suspension array analysis for detection of egg yolk antibodies against Salmonella Enteritidis.,"Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) is an important source of food-related diarrhoea in humans, and table eggs are considered the primordial source of contamination of the human food chain. Using eggs collected at egg-packing stations as samples could be a convenient strategy to detect colonization of layer flocks. The aim of this study was to evaluate egg yolk anti-Salmonella antibody detection using suspension array analysis. An egg yolk panel from contact-infected and non-colonized laying hens was used for the evaluation. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to define a cut-off value and to assess the overall accuracy of the assay. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were estimated by maximum likelihood. Sensitivity was quantified on hen level and on sample level, and also quantified as a function of time since colonization. The area under the ROC curve was estimated at 0.984 (se 0.006, P<0.001). Of all colonized contact-infected hens, 67.6% [95% CI: 46.8, 100] developed an antibody response, which was detectable 17.4 days [14.3, 26.9] after colonization. In total, 98% [95.4, 99.4] of the 'immunopositive' hens had test positive eggs. The overall sensitivity of the immunological test was 66.7% [45.9, 98.7] and the specificity was 98.5% [97.8, 99.1]. This study provided essential parameters for optimizing surveillance programs based on detection of antibodies, and indicates that immunology based on examination of egg yolk gives important information about the Salmonella status of the flock."

A total of 60 cases of typhoid fever were enrolled in to a randomized clinical trial and was divided into two groups. The inclusion criteria of the cases were: Documented fever for more than 4 days plus two or more of the following clinical features: toxic physical appearance, intestinal complaints, coated tongue, ceacal gurgling, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, diarrhoea and constipation plus positive Widal test and/or blood culture positivity. Patients who had complication like GIT heamorrhage; intestinal perforaion and/or shock were excluded from the study. Data were collected in a structured questionnaire. Azithromycin was given at a dose of 10mg/kg/day for a period of 07 days Cefixime was given at a dose of 20mg/kg/day in two divided dose for 14 days. The mean time of defervesence was 4.05+1.14 days with azithromycin and 3.41+0.95 with cefixime respectively. The minimum defervesence time was 02 days and maximum defervesence time was 07 days. Clinical cure rate was 87% in azithromycin group and 93% in cefixime group.

A dot enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has been developed which detects IgM and IgG antibodies to a specific 50 kDa outer membrane protein on Salmonella typhi. This study was performed among outpatients attending the university hospital in Kelantan, a state on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia where typhoid is endemic. The dot EIA was done on 149 outpatients of all ages in whom typhoid was suspected. Of these, 60 were not analysable due to insufficient data. The other 89 were retrospectively classed as typhoid (total = 21), or not typhoid (total = 68). The criteria for diagnosis of typhoid was either, blood culture was positive, or with blood culture negative, temperature was at least 38 degrees C and Widal O and/or H titer greater than or equal to 1/160. We then compared the diagnosis with the EIA result. For the result where either IgM or IgG was positive, sensitivity was 90%, specificity 91% and negative predictive value 97%. For IgM positive, specificity was 100%. But the specificity of IgG positive alone was reduced by six false positives, which were probably due to persistence of IgG after acute infection. Other cases were found where IgG positive alone appeared in the first week of typhoid fever, probably due to rapid response in a second or subsequent infection. We also found that IgM-producing patients were significantly younger than those showing IgG alone positive."

CD008892,0,11429465,0,The cryptic ushA gene (ushA(c)) in natural isolates of Salmonella enterica (serotype Typhimurium) has been inactivated by a single missense mutation.,"Two mutational mechanisms, both supported by experimental studies, have been proposed for the evolution of new or improved enzyme specificities in bacteria. One mechanism involves point mutation(s) in a gene conferring novel substrate specificity with partial or complete loss of the original (wild-type) activity of the encoded product. The second mechanism involves gene duplication followed by silencing (inactivation) of one of these duplicates. Some of these 'silent genes' may still be transcribed and translated but produce greatly reduced levels of functional protein; gene silencing, in this context, is distinct from the more common associations with bacterial partitioning sequences, and with genes which are no longer transcribed or translated. Whereas most Salmonella enterica strains are ushA(+), encoding an active 5'-nucleotidase (UDP-sugar hydrolase), some natural isolates, including most genetically related strains of serotype Typhimurium, have an ushA allele (designated ushA(c)) which produces a protein with, comparatively, very low 5'-nucleotidase activity. Previous sequence analysis of cloned ushA(c) and ushA(+) genes from serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 and Escherichia coli, respectively, did not reveal any changes which might account for the significantly different 5'-nucleotidase activities. The mechanism responsible for this reduced activity of UshA(c) has hitherto not been known. Sequence analysis of Salmonella ushA(+) and ushA(c) alleles indicated that the relative inactivity of UshA(c) may be due to one, or more, of four amino acid substitutions. One of these changes (S139Y) is in a sequence motif that is conserved in 5'-nucleotidases across a range of diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that a Tyr substitution of Ser-139 in Salmonella UshA(+) was solely responsible for loss of 5'-nucleotidase activity. It is concluded that the corresponding single missense mutation is the cause of the UshA(c) phenotype. This is the first reported instance of gene inactivation in natural isolates of bacteria via a missense mutation. These results support a model of evolution of new enzymes involving a 'silent gene' which produces an inactive, or relatively inactive, product, and are also consistent with the evolution of a novel, but unknown, enzyme specificity by a single amino acid change."
CD008892,0,11127268,0,The serodiagnosis of infection with Salmonella typhi.,"The serodiagnosis of infection with Salmonella typhi, using the Widal agglutination assay, relies on patients' antibodies to the O = 9,12 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens, H = d flagellar antigens, and the Vi capsular antigens. A Vi agglutination titre of > 1/40 has traditionally been regarded as indicative of recent infection with S typhi. In this study, 91 sera were used to assess the reliability of the Widal agglutination assay based on antibodies to the Vi antigens."
CD008892,0,7507252,0,Stress-inducible gene of Salmonella typhimurium identified by arbitrarily primed PCR of RNA.,"Fingerprinting of RNA by arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP) can be used to identify conditionally expressed genes in prokaryotes. Differential gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium LT2 in response to peroxide treatment was examined as a system in which to demonstrate this strategy. This treatment models the induction of bacterial protective proteins that may occur when mammalian phagocytes use peroxide to fight S. typhimurium infection. To identify genes inducible by hydrogen peroxide stress, total RNA from peroxide-treated and untreated bacterial cultures were RAP fingerprinted with six different arbitrarily selected primers. A 435-base RAP product that was differentially amplified by RAP using the reverse sequencing primer was cloned and sequenced. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the RNA corresponding to this clone, RSP435, was induced when bacteria were treated with hydrogen peroxide. The RNA was not induced in an oxyR1 mutant that constitutively expressed a subset of hydrogen peroxide-inducible genes. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and dot blot hybridization to an array of induced Mud-P22 integrations, the gene corresponding to RSP435 was mapped to two places, one between 19 and 21.5 min and one between 56 and 57 min. Thus, two similar or identical stress-inducible genes were found in different parts of the genome. Identification, cloning, and mapping of the conditionally expressed RSP435 cDNA were performed entirely by physical means, demonstrating that the strategy should complement genetic methods for many prokaryotic or archaebacterial systems and should be applicable to organisms in which genetic methods are difficult to perform or have not yet been developed."

CD008892,0,15028966,0,The spectrum of cardiovascular infections due to Salmonella enterica: a review of clinical features and factors determining outcome.,"Cardiovascular infections due to Salmonella enterica are infrequently reported, so their clinical features, prognosis, and optimal treatment are not completely known. Mortality associated with aortitis and endocarditis caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella remains exceedingly high. In this review of cases of cardiovascular infections due to Salmonella enterica studied in 2 hospitals in Madrid, we tried to assess the clinical manifestations and the procedures leading to diagnosis in addition to treatment and outcome. To complete the spectrum of infections related to cardiovascular surgery, cases of postoperative mediastinitis, pericarditis, and infections associated with cardiac devices were also included.Twenty-three patients were reviewed: 11 had mycotic aneurysms; 7 had endocarditis; 2 had device-related infections; and 3 had pericarditis, mediastinitis, and infection of an arteriovenous fistula, respectively. The risk of endovascular infection in patients older than 60 years with bacteremia due to nontyphoidal Salmonella was 23%. Most patients with aortitis had risk factors for atherosclerosis, and 6 had preexisting atherosclerotic aortic aneurysms. All except 1 patient with endocarditis had underlying cardiac disorders. Acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) was a major risk factor for salmonella bacteremia in 1 patient with aortitis and 1 with endocarditis. Fever, unremitting sepsis, ""breakthrough"" and relapsing bacteremia were the most common clinical findings. In addition, abdominal or thoracic pain and cardiac failure and pericarditis were common features in patients with aortitis and endocarditis respectively. Computed tomography (CT) scan, arteriography, and echocardiography were the main diagnostic tools. Mortality associated with mycotic aneurysms and endocarditis due to S. enterica was 45% and 28%, respectively. Thoracic aneurysms, rupture, and shock at the time of diagnosis were associated with increased mortality in patients with aortitis. In situ bypass grafting was successfully performed in most cases. After surgery, antimicrobial therapy was continued for 4-9 weeks. No relapses were observed after a mean follow-up of 64 months. Antimicrobial therapy alone or combined with valve replacement or excision of a ventricular aneurysm was successful treatment for most patients with salmonella endocarditis. Combined medical and surgical treatment was required for patients with mediastinitis and pericarditis, and patients with device-related infections needed removal of the complete device. Diagnosis of aortitis due to nontyphoidal Salmonella should be established as early as possible to reduce mortality. Patients older than 60 years who have positive blood cultures for Salmonella along with fever and back, abdominal, or chest pain should have an extensive workup for infective aortitis. Immediate bactericidal antimicrobial therapy should be started and a CT scan should be performed on an emergency basis. If a mycotic aneurysm is found, surgical resection should follow as soon as possible. Resection of the aneurysm with in situ bypass grafting is the procedure of choice. Postoperative antimicrobial therapy for 6-8 weeks seems enough to avoid relapses. Optimal treatment of patients with endocarditis occurring on ventricular aneurysms must include resection of the aneurysmal sac. Salmonella endocarditis can be successfully treated with antimicrobials alone. Valve replacement should be reserved for patients with cardiac failure or persisting sepsis, and for those who relapse after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy."

Bone marrow examination and clot biopsy from one such patient revealed hemophagocytosis and granulomas, with serologic evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus infection. Bone marrow granulomas are not a feature of Epstein-Barr infection. Later, bone marrow culture and repeat blood culture grew Salmonella typhi.

Small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. Bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. Blood cultures inoculated with Clostridium perfringens and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. Blood cultures with Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group A) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic acids. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. Blood cultures inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within 24 to 48 h of incubation. Since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias."

The group of TF patients constituted 9% of the reported national total during those years. A retrospective analysis of available clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data was carried out. Without exception, infections were contracted during travel abroad, especially to India and Indonesia. The clinical features and the response to antimicrobial treatment of TF and PTF proved essentially the same. Fever, headache and anorexia were important symptoms; rose spots and splenomegaly were found in 18/38 and 10/39 with S. typhi respectively.

The levels of all three classes of immunoglobulin anti-LPS of S. typhi were higher in typhoid patients than in healthy or febrile nontyphoidal groups; we selected various combinations between the three classes of immunoglobulin to obtain the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. The sum of the absorbance values obtained from the ELISA assay for IgG+IgA+IgM (sigma lgs) was the best choice for diagnostic utility for typhoid fever. We selected a positive test at a decision level of sigma lgs > or = 1.2 with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 92% with a frequency of false negative of 5.9%. The frequency of false positives for healthy controls was 7.7% and, for the febrile nontyphoidal group, it was 7.9%. We also compared receiver (or relative) operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the diagnostic usefulness of the ELISA with that of the Widal test, whose merits and limitations, especially in endemic regions, are discussed. The ELISA assay was much more sensitive and specific than any combination of the Widal test, and hence it could be a useful tool for the serologic diagnosis of typhoidal fever with a single blood sample."

Five low- and 7 high-seroprevalence herds were followed for seven sampling rounds. Each round, blood and faecal samples were tested in an indirect ELISA and by bacteriological culturing, respectively. In high-seroprevalence herds a positive Salmonella status was an indication of a long-term problem and the status was relatively stable over time. The herds experiencing clinical salmonellosis were not necessarily the herds with the highest seroprevalence. It is possible to deliver sero-negative finishers to the slaughterhouse, even though these pigs were seropositive as growers. In three out of five low-prevalence herds, major infection incidents occurred, indicating that changes in the Salmonella status should be anticipated. Low-prevalence herds can remain negative over a longer period of time as a result feeding a complete liquid feed containing fermented by-products."

To understand the relationship of these proteins, the cross-reactivity of several monoclonal antibodies directed against the 65-kDa Mycobacterium leprae antigen towards human, Chinese hamster, chicken, and bacterial cells has been examined. A number of antibodies (Y1-2, ML 30-A2, and F47-9-1) were found to cross-react with a 63-kDa antigen in vertebrate cell extracts and stained mitochondria in immunofluorescence studies. Some of these antibodies also reacted with a P1-beta-galactosidase fusion protein in recombinant Escherichia coli cells, expressing part of the human P1 protein. These results provide strong evidence that P1 is the mammalian homolog of the 65-kDa antigen. The human P1 protein also shows significant similarity (P less than 0.001) to a number of other bacterial and viral proteins including the pol polyprotein of human immunodeficiency viruses and the penicillin-binding protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The observed similarity between human P1 protein and the major antigenic proteins of pathogenic organisms (e.g., 60- to 65-kDa mycobacterial antigen) suggests its possible involvement in autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) by antigenic mimicry."
CD008892,0,2506223,0,Line blot and western blot immunoassays for diagnosis of Mediterranean spotted fever.,"The line blot, a new immunoassay in which antigens are placed on nitrocellulose as narrow lines, was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity relative to the microimmunofluorescence assay for the diagnosis of Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF). The line blot assay was only slightly less sensitive and less specific than the microimmunofluorescence assay for detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) or IgG in 100 serum specimens from 42 patients with MSF. No line blot reactions were observed among 50 control serum specimens from febrile patients with other illnesses. The line blot assay was largely group reactive for spotted fever rickettsiae, but 26% of the positive serum specimens also cross-reacted by IgM with Rickettsia typhi. Western immunoblotting was used to characterize the antigenic components recognized by 19 MSF serum specimens. For both IgM and IgG, lipopolysaccharide was the cross-reactive group antigen, whereas the high-molecular-weight species-specific protein antigens (SPAs) were the only reactive proteins. Relative to the other nine rickettsiae, Rickettsia bellii was unique both in exhibiting no SPA reactions and in having a lipopolysaccharide with a predominantly high-molecular-weight distribution. Although most of the 19 MSF serum specimens examined by Western blotting exhibited preferential reactivity to SPAs of two strains of R. conorii and weaker reactions to the other rickettsiae, 2 serum specimens exhibited SPA reactions consistent with typhus infections. In comparison with other assays, the line blot and Western blot immunoassays have advantages which may permit an improvement in the general availability and commercialization of assays for the serodiagnosis of rickettsial infections."

CD008892,0,15315861,0,Mucosal immunization with purified flagellin from Salmonella induces systemic and mucosal immune responses in C3H/HeJ mice.,"This study investigated the immune response elicited in C3H/HeJ mice after oral, parenteral and nasal immunization with purified flagellin from Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis alone or conjugated to starch microparticles as adjuvant or together with the uptake-enhancer recombinant cholera toxin B-subunit (rCTB). Systemic (IgM-IgG, IgA, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG1) and local (s-IgA) humoral immune responses in the mice were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Primed splenocytes were also stimulated in vitro with flagellin and the supernatants analyzed for cytokine production. Finally, immunized mice were challenged orally with live Salmonella. A high flagellin-specific IgM-IgG response was seen in all groups, especially in mice immunized nasally with flagellin plus rCTB or subcutaneously, but a strong systemic antibody response was also induced when free antigen was given orally. Intranasal or subcutaneous immunization of mice with flagellin plus rCTB or oral immunization with flagellin plus microparticles resulted in a significantly greater mucosal response (higher s-IgA titers in feces) than seen in the control group (P <0.05). The mucosal IgA responses were significantly correlated with the serum IgA titers. The subclass profile in serum revealed a mixed Th1/Th2-type response, with a predominance of Th1-type, as indicated by the subclass ratio (IgG1/IgG2a + IgG2b). The splenocytes stimulated in vitro produced interferon (IFN)-gamma, at levels, which increased with time. The group immunized with flagellin plus rCTB subcutaneously had a relatively higher IFN-gamma response than the other groups. Interleukin (IL)-2 was also produced, especially in mice immunized nasally or subcutaneously with flagellin conjugated to microparticles. However, neither IL-4 nor IL-5 was produced in any of the groups. After oral challenge with live serovar Enteritidis, the groups immunized orally or nasally with free flagellin had significantly lower degree of infection than the control group (P <0.05)."
CD008892,0,3701119,0,Specific immunoglobulin-secreting human blood cells after peroral vaccination against Salmonella typhi.,"Studies on intestinal immunity in animals have suggested that lymphocytes, after sensitization in Peyer's patches and maturation in regional lymph nodes, home via the circulation to the intestinal wall, where they secrete antibodies into the lumen. To detect such homing cells in the blood of human volunteers given oral, attenuated Salmonella typhi vaccine, we used the solid-phase enzyme-linked immunospot assay for S. typhi-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). ASCs were found in eight of 10 individuals after the third postvaccination day, peaked in level on day 7, and were undetectable on day 14. Of the cells secreting specific immunoglobulin, approximately 62% produced IgA, 32% IgM, and 6% IgG. Antibodies could not be demonstrated in serum, saliva, or feces. This technique might give an opportunity to follow the response to antigens entering the body via mucous membranes. It will be of interest to correlate these findings with protection against diseases after peroral vaccination."

CD008892,0,21935450,1,Combined rapid (TUBEX) test for typhoid-paratyphoid A fever based on strong anti-O12 response: design and critical assessment of sensitivity.,"Rapid diagnostics can be accurate but, often, those based on antibody detection for infectious diseases are unwittingly underrated for various reasons. Herein, we described the development of a combined rapid test for two clinically-indistinguishable bacterial diseases, typhoid and paratyphoid A fever, the latter fast emerging as a global threat. By using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to bacterial antigens of known chemical structures as probes, we were able to dissect the antibody response in patients at the level of monosaccharides. Thus, a mAb specific for a common lipopolysaccharide antigen (O12) found in both the causative organisms was employed to semi-quantify the amounts of anti-O12 antibodies present in both types of patients in an epitope-inhibition particle-based (TUBEX) immunoassay. This colorimetric assay detected not only anti-O12 antibodies that were abundantly produced, but also, by steric hindrance, antibodies to an adjoining epitope (O9 or O2 in the typhoid or paratyphoid bacillus, respectively). Sensitivity and, particularly, reaction intensities, were significantly better than those obtained using an anti-O9 or anti-O2 mAb-probe in the examination of paired sera from 22 culture-confirmed typhoid patients (sensitivity, 81.8% vs 75.0%) or single sera from 36 culture-confirmed paratyphoid patients (52.8% vs 28.6), respectively. Importantly, sensitivity was better (97.1% for typhoid, 75.0% for paratyphoid) if allowance was made for the absence of relevant antibodies in certain specimens as determined by an independent, objective assay (ELISA)--such specimens might have been storage-denatured (especially the older paratyphoid samples) or procured from non-responders. Benchmarking against ELISA, which revealed high concordance between the two tests, was useful and more appropriate than comparing with culture methods as traditionally done, since antibody tests and culture target slightly different stages of these diseases. Paired sera analysis was insightful, revealing 64% of typhoid patients who had no change in antibody titer over 4-16 days, and 14% with no IgM-IgG class-switching."

CD008892,0,2664692,0,Nontyphoidal Salmonella enteric infections and bacteremia.,"Antimicrobial treatment of nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis is usually advocated for infants younger than 3 months of age based on published data showing that infants in this age group are more prone to have bacteremia and develop extraintestinal focal infections. A review of nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates from our institution from January, 1981, through March, 1988, was undertaken to assess the role of age and specific serovar on the incidence of bacteremia. Two hundred twenty isolates were identified: one cerebrospinal fluid, 14 blood and 205 stool. The mean age of patients with bacteremia was 182 months, not significantly different from the mean age of 142 months for patients with stool isolates. Salmonella weltevreden was the most frequent isolate accounting for 23% of all isolates and all isolates of this organism were from stool cultures. Patients with S. weltevreden infections had mean and median ages of 50 and 2.5 months and were younger than patients with stool isolates from other serovars who had mean and median ages of 174 and 38 months. Infants younger than 3 or 6 months of age with positive stool cultures in whom blood cultures were obtained did not demonstrate a higher incidence of bacteremia than did older patients. We conclude that the incidence of bacteremia in patients with nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis is highly related to the invasiveness of the infecting specific Salmonella serovar."
CD008892,0,14742202,0,Genetic analysis and complete primary structure of microcin L.,"Escherichia coli LR05, in addition to producing MccB17, J25, and D93, secretes microcin L, a newly discovered microcin that exhibits strong antibacterial activity against related Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Microcin L was purified using a two-step procedure including solid-phase extraction and reverse-phase C(18) high-performance liquid chromatography. A 4,901-bp region of the DNA plasmid of E. coli LR05 was sequenced revealing that the microcin L cluster consists of four genes, mclC, mclI, mclA, and mclB. The structural gene mclC encoded a 105-amino-acid precursor with a 15-amino-acid N-terminal extension ending with a Gly-Ala motif upstream of the cleavage site. This motif is typical of the class II microcins and other gram-positive bacteriocins exported by ABC transporters. The mclI immunity gene was identified upstream of the mclC gene and encodes a 51-amino-acid protein with two potential transmembrane domains. Located on the reverse strand, two genes, mclA and mclB, encoded the proteins MclA and MclB, respectively. They bear strong relatedness with the ABC transporter proteins and accessory factors involved in the secretion of microcins H47, V, E492, and 24. The microcin L genetic system resembles the genetic organization of MccV. Furthermore the MccL primary structure has been determined. It is a 90-amino-acid peptide of 8,884 Da with two disulfide bridges. The N-terminal region has significant homologies with several gram-positive bacteriocins. The C-terminal 32-amino-acid sequence is 87.5% identical to that of MccV. Together, these results strongly indicate that microcin L is a gram-negative class II microcin."
CD008892,0,5307603,0,A controlled field trial to evaluate the protective capacity of a single dose of acetone-killed agar-grown and heat-killed broth-grown typhoid vaccines.,In a strictly controlled field trial among schoolchildren a study was made of the protective capacity of single doses of 2 typhoid vaccines: a heat-killed broth-grown sorbed dried vaccine made in the USSR (vaccine G-66) and an acetone-killed agar-grown dried vaccine (vaccine K-66) made in Yugoslavia. The latter vaccine was supplied by the World Health Organization.A single dose of these preparations exerted a statistically significant protective effect during the first 10 months of observation. The protection afforded by the acetone-killed and heat-killed sorbed vaccines was similar in duration and intensity to that resulting from single doses of other types of typhoid vaccines that had been evaluated earlier in the USSR. The data obtained confirm once again that successful immunization against typhoid is possible with a single dose of vaccine.The absence of any substantial difference in morbidity between the groups concerned indicates that the heat-killed broth-grown and acetone-killed agar-grown vaccines exert a roughly similar protective effect.
CD008892,0,12458119,0,Expression of recombinant proteins of Orientia tsutsugamushi and their applications in the serodiagnosis of scrub typhus.,"In this study, recombinant proteins that encompassed the AD I-AD III regions of 56 kDa immunodominant gene of 2 Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT) serotypes; Gilliam and TA763 were expressed in Escherichia coli. Both recombinant proteins exhibited serologic cross-reactivity with the rabbit antisera against various OT serotypes, as evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but not against other rickettsial species, including Rickettsia typhi, R. prowazekii and TT118 SFG rickettsiae. The feasibility of using the recombinant proteins as a diagnostic reagent was further evaluated by ELISA using sera from blood donors and scrub typhus patients. The results suggested a higher affinity of the antihuman IgM than IgG with both recombinant proteins. The IgM ELISA findings were agreeable with the results of indirect immunoperoxidase (IIP) assay especially with sera of high antibody (1:1600). However, more than one antigen are probably needed for development of an effective assay for serodiagnosis of scrub typhus in endemic areas."
CD008892,0,11339472,0,Salmonella encephalopathy with seizure and frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.,"A 54-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic with frequent convulsions. Subsequently she developed a toxic look, rigidity, confusion and severe encephalopathy. Salmonella typhii was isolated from the blood cultures and she was diagnosed with Salmonella encephalopathy. The prominent electrophysiological finding was the frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) in electroencephalograph (EEG). After treatment EEG revealed normal activity. The presence of FIRDA is not a specific finding but this kind of EEG change has not been reported before. Diffuse encephalopathy due to endotoxins might be the reason. We propose that S. typhii encephalopathy was the cause of FIRDA which is a sign of diffuse encephalopathy."

CD008892,0,17050821,0,Misidentification of a mucoid strain of Salmonella enterica serotype choleraesuis as Hafnia alvei by the Vitek GNI+ card system.,"Nontyphoidal salmonellae are among the most common causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. They are also notable causes of extraintestinal infections, including bacteremia and vascular infections. Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis is typically associated with invasive infections. We report a patient who had an infected intra-abdominal aortic aneurysm due to an unusually mucoid strain of Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis. The isolate was erroneously identified as Hafnia alvei by the Vitek GNI+ card system. A blood culture isolate taken from the same patient 9 months earlier was also identified as H. alvei by the Vitek GNI+ card system. Despite an apparent cure with intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid at that time, the Salmonella infection had not been cleared and manifested as a ruptured infected abdominal aortic aneurysm. Repeated passage of the strain yielded nonmucoid colonies, which were correctly identified by the API and PHOENIX systems. The isolates from the aneurysm and the former bacteremic episode were found to be identical using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The fallibility of automated bacterial identification systems is highlighted. Such errors are especially important for isolates in which in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing does not correlate with the clinical success of treatment, as illustrated by Salmonella infections."
CD008892,0,19919288,0,Transmission dynamics of a multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhimurium outbreak in a dairy farm.,"Cattle are recognized as an important source of foodborne Salmonella causing human illness, particularly for antimicrobial-resistant strains. The transmission dynamics of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella after the onset of a clinical outbreak in a dairy farm has been rarely monitored. The early transmission of a pathogen influences the outbreak size and persistence of the pathogen at the farm level and, therefore, how long the herd represents a risk for Salmonella zoonotic transmission. The objective of this study was to describe the transmission dynamics of MDR Salmonella Typhimurium after the onset of a clinical outbreak in a dairy herd. For that purpose, fecal shedding and serological response to MDR Salmonella were monitored in a longitudinal study conducted in a dairy herd after a few cases of salmonellosis, and a stochastic transmission model was developed to predict Salmonella persistence at the pen level. The outbreak was limited to five clinical cases, and only 18 animals out of 500 cows shed Salmonella in feces. The longest shedder was culture-positive for Salmonella for at least 68 days. The isolates (n = 27) were represented by four pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns; three patterns were similar. With one exception, isolates were resistant to nine or more antimicrobial drugs. Simulations of the transmission model indicated that approximately 50% of the outbreaks were likely to die out within 20 days after the first animal was infected. The simulation studies indicated that salmonellosis outbreaks with few clinical cases were likely due to the extinction of the pathogen in the premises in the early phase of the outbreaks. Small population size and group structure within the farm decrease the on-farm persistence of the pathogen."

Blood and stool cultures were positive in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks of illness. There was no significant difference between percentages of elevated O and H titres, whether done during or after the 1st week of illness. A four-fold rise in (O) titres occurred in 50% of cases tested. We would miss 50% of typhoid fever cases if a titre (O) equal to more than 1/160 were relied upon for diagnosis. Altogether, 46% of patients had leucopenia. Chloramphenicol was the most commonly used antibiotic. There were two deaths."
CD008892,0,22526569,0,Variability of RNA quality extracted from biofilms of foodborne pathogens using different kits impacts mRNA quantification by qPCR.,"The biofilm formation by foodborne pathogens is known to increase the problem related with surface disinfection procedure in the food processing environment and consequent transmission of these pathogens into the population. Messenger RNA has been increasingly used to understand the action and the consequences of disinfectants in the virulence on such biofilms. RNA quality is an important requirement for any RNA-based analysis since the quality can impair the mRNA quantification. Therefore, we evaluated five different RNA extraction kits using biofilms of the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica. The five kits yielded RNA with different quantities and qualities. While for E. coli the variability of RNA quality did not affect the quantification of mRNA, the same was not true for L. monocytogenes or S. enterica. Therefore, our results indicate that not all kits are suitable for RNA extraction from bacterial biofilms, and thus, the selection of RNA extraction kit is crucial to obtain accurate and meaningful mRNA quantification."

When the fliF gene of Salmonella typhimurium, which was previously shown to code for the component protein of the M ring, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, the FliF subunits formed ring structures in the cytoplasmic membrane. Electron microscopic observation of the purified ring structures revealed that each was composed of two adjacent rings and a short appendage extending from the center of the rings. Antibodies raised against the purified FliF protein decorated both the M and S rings of the intact basal body. We conclude that the FliF protein is the subunit protein of the M ring, and of the S ring and of part of the proximal rod of the flagellar basal body."

CD008892,0,9202748,0,Analysis of cooked muscle meats for heterocyclic aromatic amine carcinogens.,"A number of related heterocyclic amines that are mutagenic in bacterial test systems and carcinogenic in animals are formed during the cooking of food. The most commonly reported and abundant compounds are PhIP, MeIQx, DiMeIQx, IQ and A alpha C. Using analysis by solid-phase extraction and HPLC, amounts found in foods range from less than one ng/g for products from fast-food restaurants, up to 14 ng/g in commercially cooked products and over 300 ng/g for well done flame-grilled chicken breast meat. Interestingly, marinating meat for 4 h greatly reduces the amount of PhIP produced during cooking, but not MeIQx. Comparing mutagenic activity in meat samples to the mutagenic activity accounted for by the known heterocyclic amines shows that most samples have activity that cannot be accounted for by the aromatic amines we can currently identify. This suggests that additional compounds are present in these foods and need to be investigated, particularly those grilled over open flames."

Serum samples collected from clinically ill individuals were submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by physicians via state health departments from throughout the United States and tested against a panel of ehrlichial and rickettsial pathogens. Antibodies reactive to the HGE agent were detected in 142 (8.9%) of 1,602 individuals tested. There were 19 confirmed and 59 probable (n = 78) cases of HGE as defined by seroconversion or a fourfold or higher titer to the HGE agent than to the Ehrlichia chaffeensis antigens. The average age of patients with HGE was 57 years, and males accounted for 53 (68%) of the patients. Cases of HGE occurred in 21 states; 47 (60%) of the cases occurred in Connecticut (n = 14), New York (n = 18), and Wisconsin (n = 15). Onset of HGE was identified from April through December, with cases peaking in June and July. The earliest confirmed cases of HGE occurred in 1987 in Wisconsin and 1988 in Florida. No fatalities were reported among the 78 patients with confirmed or probable HGE. Reactivity to the HGE agent and to either Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia rickettsii, or Rickettsia typhi was infrequent; however, 74 (52%) of the 142 individuals who were positive for HGE had at least one serum sample that also reacted to the E. chaffeensis antigen. Thirty-four persons with confirmed or probable human monocytic ehrlichiosis due to E. chaffeensis also had antibodies to the HGE agent in at least one serum sample. The specific etiologic agent for 30 patients was not ascribed because of similarity of titers to both ehrlichial antigens. The use of both antigens may be required to correctly diagnose most cases of human ehrlichiosis, especially in geographic regions where both the HGE agent and E. chaffeensis occur."

Other common isolates included Staphylococcus aureus (531 infections; 9.5%) and Escherichia coli (412; 7.3%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex accounted for 166 (30.7%) of 539 isolates in seven studies that used mycobacterial culture techniques. HIV infection was associated with any bloodstream infection, particularly with S enterica and M tuberculosis complex bacteraemia. Where recorded, patients with bloodstream infections had an in-hospital case fatality of 18.1%. Our results show that bloodstream infections are common and associated with high mortality. Improved clinical microbiology services and reassessment of empirical treatment guidelines that account for the epidemiology of bloodstream infections might contribute to better outcomes."

All patients were randomly assigned to receive chloramphenicol (500 mg four times a day orally) for 14 days or ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day orally) for 7 days. In each treatment group, patients were subsequently randomized to have blood and bone marrow cultured after either 3 or 5 days of treatment. Twenty-seven patients received chloramphenicol, and 28 received ciprofloxacin. The two groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics. No significant differences in clinical cure and time to defervescence were found. All strains isolated were susceptible to both antibiotics. Although ciprofloxacin was more effective in the elimination of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A from bone marrow than chloramphenicol, there was still an impressive persistence of Salmonella in the bone marrow culture (67%). In the ciprofloxacin-treated patients the suppressed cytokine production capacity showed a trend to normalize earlier than in patients treated with chloramphenicol."

The Widal and IHA tests were positive in 41 (91.1%) and 42 (93.3%) of patients with typhoid fever after the second week of illness. Comparison between the Widal and IHA test showed that the latter was more sensitive as assessed by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test (p less than 0.01). The anti-LPS antibody belongs to all three classes of immunoglobulins namely IgG, IgM and IgA with the confinement mostly to IgG and IgM. It was found that the level of haemagglutinating enhancement activity was strongest in IgG class. The low level of anti LPS-antibody was found in healthy persons with the pattern of immunoglobulin class of antibody similar to that in patients with typhoid fever."

Recently, there has been an upsurge in the occurrence of bacterial isolates that are resistant to ciprofloxacin, and the emergence of broad spectrum β-lactamases in typhoidal salmonellae constitutes a new challenge for the clinician. A total of 337 blood culture isolates of S. Typhi, isolated from Pondicherry, India, between January 2005 and December 2009, were investigated using phenotypic, molecular and serological methods. Of the 337 isolates, 74 (22%) were found to be multidrug resistant (MDR) and 264 (78%) nalidixic acid resistant (NAR). Isolates with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin possessed single mutations in the gyrA gene. A high rate of resistance (8%) was found to ciprofloxacin. All isolates with a ciprofloxacin MIC ≥ 4 mg/L possessed both double mutations in the QRDR of the gyrA gene and a single mutation in the parC gene. Active efflux pump mechanisms were also found to be involved in ciprofloxacin resistance. Finally, a large number of PFGE patterns (non-clonal genotypes) were observed among the S. Typhi isolates. In conclusion, a high rate of ciprofloxacin resistance was observed in comparison to other endemic areas in blood culture isolates of S. Typhi from Pondicherry, India, with steadily increasing NAR but decreasing MDR isolations over the study period. This is most likely to be due to an increased use of ciprofloxacin as a first-line drug of choice over more traditional antimicrobial agents for the treatment of typhoid fever."
CD008892,0,6311874,0,Evaluation of sodium polyanethanol sulfonate as a blood culture additive for recovery of Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A.,"A total of 640 blood specimens from patients in an area endemic for enteric fever were cultured in parallel in tryptic soy broth with and without sodium polyanethanol sulfonate (SPS). A total of 95 specimens were positive for Salmonella spp., 54 for Salmonella typhi, and 41 for Salmonella paratyphi A in one or both bottles of a set. Significantly higher rates of recovery were obtained from the SPS-containing medium (P less than 0.01) upon subculturing blindly at 24 h and 3 days of incubation. Subcultures performed at 7, 14, and 21 days also yielded a greater number of positive cultures with SPS than without it, although the differences between the two media were not significant (P greater than 0.05). Neither of the media yielded 100% of the positive cultures. Moreover, even if the results of the two media were combined, 34 and 19% of the isolates would have been missed if the specimens had not been incubated to 14 and 21 days, respectively. The data indicate that SPS aids in early recovery of S. typhi and S. paratyphi A from blood cultures, and additionally, that under the conditions used in the study, incubation beyond a 1-week period is required for efficient isolation of these organisms from blood."

On the other hand, melioidosis is a newly emerging disease from this region, which is most often misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed by clinicians. It is well accepted that false-positive Widal reactions following certain non-typhoid Salmonella infections may occur commonly. Three cases of high titers of Widal test are described, where melioidosis was the actual diagnosis in every occasion and was never suspected until diagnosed microbiologically. All the patients had shown a partial response to ceftriaxone. Blood and pus cultures grew Burkholderia pseudomallei, whereas Salmonella typhi was not isolated from blood in any patient. With appropriate antibiotics, the patients showed clinical and microbiological improvement with lowering of Widal titers. These 3 cases show that high Widal titer in any patient may mislead the diagnosis of melioidosis, and further laboratory workup should always be done to rule out melioidosis, especially in cases with nonresponsiveness to treatment."

CD008892,0,1737934,0,Expression of human IL-1 beta in Salmonella typhimurium. A model system for the delivery of recombinant therapeutic proteins in vivo.,"The feasibility of using Salmonella typhimurium aroA mutant (SL3261) to deliver protein therapeutic agents was investigated in a murine model system. We have constructed an Escherichia coli expression plasmid designed to express the human protein IL-1 beta. This plasmid expresses IL-1 beta to high levels (greater than 30% total cell protein) in E. coli. In Salmonella the IL-1 beta is expressed constitutively to about 10% total cell protein, as verified by Western blotting analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-1 beta antibody. The protein is produced in a soluble and biologically active form. BALB/c mice administered orally or i.v. with S. typhimurium aroA mutants carrying the plasmid produced highly significant antibody responses against human IL-1 beta as determined by a solid-phase RIA. Furthermore, mice injected with the construct were significantly protected against lethal gamma-irradiation (850 rad). This study therefore demonstrates that the vaccine strain of Salmonella mutants can also be used effectively to deliver therapeutic proteins in vivo."
CD008892,0,20032253,0,Molecular characterization of extended-spectrum cephalosporinase-producing Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis isolates from patients in Thailand and Denmark.,"The objective of this study was to characterize extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (ESC)-producing isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis recovered from patients in Thailand and Denmark. Twenty-four blood culture isolates from 22 patients were included in the study, of which 23 isolates were recovered from 21 Thai patients during 2003, 2007, or 2008 and one isolate was recovered from a Danish traveler to Thailand. ESC production was confirmed in 13 out of the 24 isolates by MIC testing. Microarray and plasmid profiling (replicon typing and restriction fragment length polymorphism [RFLP]) were used to characterize the genetic mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in the 13 ESC-producing isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and MIC testing were used to compare the clonality between the 13 ESC-producing isolates and the 11 non-ESC-producing isolates. Based on susceptibility patterns, the ESC-producing isolates were more closely related than non-ESC-producing isolates. Microarray, PCR, plasmid profiling, and replicon typing revealed that the 13 ESC-producing isolates harbored either bla(CMY-2) containing incA/C or bla(CTX-M-14) containing incFIIA, incFrepB, and an unknown replicon located on plasmids ranging in size from 75 to 200 kb. The RFLP and replicon typing clustered the isolates into four distinct groups. PFGE revealed 16 unique patterns and five clusters; each cluster contained two or three of the 24 isolates. The isolate from the Danish patient was indistinguishable from two Thai clinical isolates by PFGE. This study revealed the emergence of the bla(CTX-M-14) gene among several clones of Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis. Numerous plasmids were identified containing up to two different ESC genes and four distinct replicons. A ""travel-associated"" spread was confirmed. Overall, a high degree of clonal diversity between isolates resistant and susceptible to cephalosporins was observed. The findings represent a serious threat to public health for the Thai people and tourists."

The patients were children one month to 12 years of age with clinical evidence of typhoid fever, positive blood or stool cultures for S. typhi, and/or a positive Widal test result who were admitted over a two-year period to General Hospital (Kota Bharu, Malaysia). These patients received standard inpatient treatment for enteric fever including chloramphenicol therapy for 14 days. Dot EIA tests were performed as part of clinical and laboratory assessments on admission, at two weeks, and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 months postdischarge. Assessment of the longevity of positive dot EIA IgM and IgG titers was done by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In 94 evaluable patients, 28% were dot EIA IgM positive but IgG negative on admission, 50% were both IgM and IgG positive, and 22% were IgM negative and IgG positive. Mean persistence of IgM dot EIA positivity was 2.6 months (95% confidence interval = 2.0-3.1 months) and that of IgG was 5.4 months (4.5-6.3 months). There were no significant differences between the three subgroups. Thus, positive IgM and IgG results determined by dot EIA within four and seven months, respectively, following documented or suspected enteric fever in a child from an endemic area should be interpreted with caution. In other clinical situations, the dot EIA remains a rapid and reliable aid to diagnosis."

Fifty-one antigen-reactive spots were detected by antisera on two-dimensional immunoblots and identified as 12 specific proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. OmpA and DNA starvation/ stationary phase protection protein (Dps) were the most abundant proteins among the identified OMPs, comprising 22 and 12 protein species, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the Dps of S. Enteritidis is also antigenic. OmpW was also verified to have high antigenicity. These results show that OmpA, Dps, and possibly OmpW are antigenic proteins. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the immunogenic characteristics of S. Enteritidis OMPs."

The ELISAs were based on serovar Enteritidis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and serovar Typhimurium LPS. The antibody levels were assessed approximately 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the onset of salmonellosis. Sera from 164 healthy blood donors were analyzed to establish cutoff values for each analysis. One month after the onset of symptoms, the sensitivities of the assays were 95% for patients recovering from a serovar Enteritidis infection and 89% for patients recovering from a serovar Typhimurium infection. Three months after the onset of symptoms, these values had decreased to 85% and 55%. At 6 months they were 62% and 40%, and at 12 months they were 40% and 16%, respectively. The specificities of the assays were 97% for the serovar Enteritidis LPS ELISA and 94% for the serovar Typhimurium LPS ELISA. The high values for both sensitivity and specificity make these two ELISAs useful for serodiagnoses of Salmonella infection shortly after the acute phase of the infection and of Salmonella-associated reactive arthritis, as well as for seroepidemiological studies.

Patients received chloramphenicol capsules (total daily dosage, 2 g) plus placebo tablets for furazolidone tablets (total daily dosage, 800 mg) plus placebo capsules for 14 days. Seven patients were excluded from the analysis of efficacy because blood, bile, or bone marrow cultures at admission failed to demonstrate the presence of Salmonella typhi. Four additional patients were excluded because of intercurrent illness or failure to return for follow-up visits. Cure was achieved in 31 (97%) of 32 chloramphenicol recipients and 24 (86%) of 28 furazolidone recipients. In the chloramphenicol group, one patient experienced moderate sideroblastic anemia, and another experienced moderate neutropenia. Both adverse reactions resolved spontaneously within 7 days.

In a single food-source outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis, serum was collected from dysenteric individuals with and without ReA at 6, 12, and 24 months post infection. Serum was also collected from control patients with no prior exposure to Salmonella infection. Quantitative measurements of isotypic antibodies to Salmonella enteritidis LPS were performed by an ELISA. Sensitivity and specificity of quantitative isotypic antibody levels over time were plotted on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Serum IgG and IgA anti-LPS were found to be present in higher levels in the ReA patients than in controls. Using the optimal cutoff of 0.10 selected from an ROC curve, IgG anti-LPS is 88% sensitive and 94% specific, and IgA anti-LPS is 75% sensitive and 100% specific. We conclude that IgA anti-LPS is both sensitive and specific in distinguishing prior exposure to Salmonella LPS in ReA patients compared to unexposed controls."

CD008892,0,7342378,0,Diagnostic value of the Widal test.,"The usefulness of a single Widal test to diagnose typhoid fever in Ethiopia was investigated in three study groups both retrospectively and prospectively. These were blood culture proven typhoid and non-typhoid patients and healthy individuals. Salmonella typhi H and O titres greater than or equal to 1:160 occurred in respectively 82% and 58% of typhoid fever patients; only 4% of healthy individuals and 8% of non-typhoid patients had Widal titres greater than or equal to 1:80. In typhoid fever, the H titre is elevated earlier and more frequently than the O titre. Antibody rise is maximal during the second week of illness. Antibiotic treatment did not affect the rise of antibody titre in typhoid fever. A single Widal test in an unvaccinated Ethiopian patient showing H and/or O titres greater than or equal to 1:160 and typhoid-like symptoms is strongly suggestive of typhoid fever. It also appears that H titre is more useful than O titre. More false positives are found than false negatives. Under these circumstances, the clinical picture is the decisive factor in making a diagnosis of typhoid."

A tetrazolium-stained S. typhimurium antigen was employed with microagglutination techniques and equipment for the first time in conducting the AG test. Results with the conventional macroscopy tube agglutination test for S. typhimurium and the 24-hr microtest were comparable; however, the AG test enhanced titers as much as 16 times, and these persisted at a significant level for as long as 4 months. This study is being extended to other Salmonella serotypes and possible field applications of the AG test procedure."
CD008892,0,1724780,0,Evaluation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Salmonella typhi antigen and antibodies.,"Enteric fever is considered a major health problem in developing countries. The need for a rapid, accurate and conclusive method for diagnosis is important for adequate and proper treatment. The usefulness and reliability of the ELISA test in detection of S. typhi O antigen and specific IgG and IgM antibodies were assessed using sera obtained from 63 subjects clinically suspected to have enteric fever, 22 febrilenon-enteric subjects and 20 normal subjects. ELISA detection of S. typhi somatic antigen was positive in 75% of subjects with positive clot cultures. IgG and IgM antibodies to S. typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were detected in sera from 83% and 88% of enteric fever subjects, respectively. While anti-LPS IgM was negative in all sera from febrile non-enteric subjects, 9% were positive for anti-LPS-IgG. The use of an ELISA for detection of anti-S. typhi LPS antibody in combination with the Widal test and/or the O antigen detection ELISA would provide a useful (95.8% sensitivity) adjunct to standard culture methods and allow for an earlier and more rapid diagnosis of enteric fever."

CD008892,0,22441064,0,Fever in the returning traveller.,"International travel is increasing and a significant number of travellers will develop a febrile illness during or shortly after their return from the tropics. The differential diagnosis is broad and a systematic approach to the management of these patients is required in order to establish the diagnosis and to initiate prompt and effective treatment. Fever may be due to infectious agents found only in tropical countries, or due to infections unrelated to travel and found worldwide. Important infections that should be considered in all returning travellers include malaria, dengue, enteric fever, rickettsial infections, and HIV seroconversion. Other diagnoses will be considered after a detailed history including countries visited with dates, activities undertaken and symptoms. At a minimum, all travellers from countries where there is malaria transmission should be tested repeatedly for malaria as well as having several sets of blood cultures taken. Many tropical infections are diagnosed serologically at specialist reference laboratories. Specialist advice on the investigation and management of returning travellers should be sought from infectious diseases physicians and microbiologists. Patients with malaria or enteric fever may deteriorate rapidly and travellers should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they become unwell after travel to the tropics. This review will focus on some of the more important imported infections, diagnostic clues from the history, examination and investigations, and important considerations in their management."

Twenty-two patients responded, the mean period to defervescence being three days and to relief of toxaemia being 1-7 days. Another nineteen patients with similarly proven typhoid were treated with chloramphenicol (100 mg/kg/day) in four divided daily doses for 10 days. Eighteen patients responded, defervescence occurring in an average of 4-1 days and relief of toxaemia in a mean of 2-6 days.

Among the patients 43% were female, 57% were male, 63.2% were from outpatient clinics and 36.8% were hospitalized patients. Seventy eight percent of the patients had gastroenteritis, 10.7% had septicemia/local infection, 9.8% had typhoid/paratyphoid fever and 1.5% were carriers. Incidence of gastroenteritis was higher in 0-5 years age group (p<0.001). Of the 620 Salmonella enterica isolates, 47.7% were S. Enteritidis, 34.7% S. Typhimurium, 6% S. Paratyphi B, 2.9% S. Typhi, 0.2% S. paratyphi A, 6.1% serogroup C1, and 2.4% serogroup C2. S. Enteritidis was the most common serotype in all provinces except for Kayseri, where S. Typhimurium was found to be the most common serotype (68.2%). Overall, the most frequently isolated serotype was S. Enteritidis, also being the most common serotype in stool and blood cultures. During the surveillance period two outbreaks have occurred, the first one by S. Enteritidis strains in Edirne, and the second one by S. Typhimurium strains in Kayseri. As a result, Salmonella infections are still a common health problem in Turkey, and active surveillance of Salmonella infections has vital importance."
CD008892,0,15131144,1,Evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid fever.,"Laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever requires isolation and identification of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. In many areas where this disease is endemic, laboratory capability is limited. Recent advances in molecular immunology have led to the identification of sensitive and specific markers for typhoid fever and technology to manufacture practical and inexpensive kits for their rapid detection. We evaluated three commercial kits for serologic diagnosis of typhoid fever. Patients presenting with > or = 4 days of fever were enrolled at two hospitals in Southern Vietnam. Cases were patients with serotype Typhi isolated from blood samples, and controls were patients with other laboratory-confirmed illnesses. Serotype Typhi isolates were confirmed and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility at the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. The Widal test was run at the hospitals and the Pasteur Institute. Sera were shipped frozen to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and tested by using Multi-Test Dip-S-Ticks, TyphiDot, and TUBEX to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG and IgM, and IgM, respectively. Package insert protocol instructions were followed. We enrolled 59 patients and 21 controls. The sensitivity and specificity findings were as follows: 89 and 53% for Multi-Test Dip-S-Ticks, 79 and 89% for TyphiDot, 78 and 89% for TUBEX, and 64 and 76% for Widal testing in hospitals and 61% and 100% for Widal testing at the Pasteur Institute. For all assays, the sensitivity was highest in the second week of illness. The Widal test was insensitive and displayed interoperator variability. Two rapid kits, TyphiDot and TUBEX, demonstrated promising results."
CD008892,0,10882661,0,Serological differentiation of murine typhus and epidemic typhus using cross-adsorption and Western blotting.,"Differentiation of murine typhus due to Rickettsia typhi and epidemic typhus due to Rickettsia prowazekii is critical epidemiologically but difficult serologically. Using serological, epidemiological, and clinical criteria, we selected sera from 264 patients with epidemic typhus and from 44 patients with murine typhus among the 29,188 tested sera in our bank. These sera cross-reacted extensively in indirect fluorescent antibody assays (IFAs) against R. typhi and R. prowazekii, as 42% of the sera from patients with epidemic typhus and 34% of the sera from patients with murine typhus exhibited immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or IgG titers against the homologous antigen (R. prowazekii and R. typhi, respectively) that were more than one dilution higher than those against the heterologous antigen. Serum cross-adsorption studies and Western blotting were performed on sera from 12 selected patients, 5 with murine typhus, 5 with epidemic typhus, and 2 suffering from typhus of undetermined etiology. Differences in IFA titers against R. typhi and R. prowazekii allowed the identification of the etiological agent in 8 of 12 patients. Western blot studies enabled the identification of the etiological agent in six patients. When the results of IFA and Western blot studies were considered in combination, identification of the etiological agent was possible for 10 of 12 patients. Serum cross-adsorption studies enabled the differentiation of the etiological agent in all patients. Our study indicates that when used together, Western blotting and IFA are useful serological tools to differentiate between R. prowazekii and R. typhi exposures. While a cross-adsorption study is the definitive technique to differentiate between infections with these agents, it was necessary in only 2 of 12 cases (16.7%), and the high costs of such a study limit its use."
CD008892,0,19182742,1,Comparison between DOT EIA IgM and Widal Test as early diagnosis of typhoid fever.,"A recently developed DOT enzyme immunoassay known as ""Typhidot"" for detecting IgM antibody against 50 KDa OMP antigen of Salmonella typhi, was evaluated on 100 clinically suspected typhoid fever cases and 40 age-sex matched controls, in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College during, the period from June 2006 to July 2007. Blood culture, Widal test, and DOT EIA for IgM test were performed in all patients. Among 100 clinically suspected typhoid fever cases, 35 were subsequently confirmed on the basis of positive blood culture for S. typhi and/or significant rising titre of Widal test. The DOT EIA IgM test could produce results within 1 hour. The result of the DOT EIA IgM test showed a good diagnostic value for typhoid fever. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the test was found as 91.42%, 90.00%, 88.88% and 92.30% respectively. On the other hand corresponding values for Widal test were of 42.85%, 85.00%, 71.42% and 62.96% respectively. Thus, The DOT EIA IgM seems to be a practical alternative to Widal test for early diagnosis of typhoid fever."

CD008892,0,2126297,0,Therapeutic implications of ofloxacin in the treatment of typhoid fever caused by multiply resistant Salmonella typhi.,"The antibiotic of choice for the treatment of typhoid fever in most parts of the world is still chloramphenicol. Ampicillin and cotrimoxazole have been used in recent years. Selection of antimicrobials for therapy has been complicated by the emergence of Salmonella typhi strains resistant to the above mentioned antibiotics. Blood and/or bone marrow cultures of 30 adult patients grew S. typhi that was resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole. However, these strains were sensitive to cefotaxime, ceftrioxone, aztreonam and ofloxacin. Ofloxacin 400 mg twice a day was given orally to these patients for 14 days. All patients recovered with no untoward side effect. We concluded that ofloxacin can be used as a drug of choice for typhoid fever, in those adult patients who are infected with S. typhi resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole."

Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis. Cefotaxime was administered for ten days. Fever promptly disappeared but one week later recurred with abdominal and back pain. Cultures grew again Salmonella enteritidis. Biopsy of the hepatic nodule showed hepatocarcinoma. Computed abdominal tomography showed a paraaortic mass. Angiography demonstrated hematoma communicating with the aortic lumen. The patient underwent revascularization of the involved aortic tract and resection of the hepatic nodule. Histology showed suppurative aortic endarteritis and a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with a large area of suppurative necrosis. The recovery of Salmonella species as of any uncommon bacteria from blood should warrant a through research of underlying disease, especially cancer."
CD008892,0,18167578,0,[Salmonella typhimurium aortitis].,"Salmonella tiphymurium infection frequently causes gastroenteritis but some cases have a predilection for damaged blood vessels, especially those affected by atherosclerosis. The abdominal aorta is the most frequent location. Salmonella aortitis with mycotic aneurysm formation is a rare but serious condition, due to the high risk of rupture. We report the clinical case of a 61 year old man with a history of diabetes and hypertension, who was previously admitted with Salmonella gastroenteritis for which he had been treated with proper antibiotics. He was readmitted with fever, nausea and low back pain. Salmonella thyphimurium was isolated in blood cultures. The investigation revealed a pseudoaneurysm formation on the abdominal aorta. He was submitted to surgical vascular grafting with aneurysm resection and antibiotic therapy before and after surgery, with excellent clinical outcome. Bacteremia due to Salmonella Typhymurium must always raise the suspicion of focalization, especially a vascular infection. Particular attention should be given to predisposing factors, such as pre-existent atherosclerosis and age. The advised treatment of mycotic aneurysm due to a Salmonella agent must be a combined medical and surgical therapy."

Epidemiologic and clinical study].,"Based on 140 cases of typhoid fever observed in the pediatrics service of the Menzel Bourguiba hospital (Tunisia), the authors demonstrate that such an endemic disease still exists in rural areas, with a peak during autumn-winter season. They underline the importance of the contamination due to water. The disease strikes all groups of age. Infants represent 15% of the patients. On its clinical and biological aspect, the disease is significantly different in child or infant. Blood cultures are positive in 2/3 of the cases, while fecal cultures are positive only in 1/3 of the cases. Despite some complications occurring in 1/6 of the cases, evolution is generally favourable. However, infant septicemia is severe, causing death in 1/3 of the cases."

CD008892,0,21914192,0,Host response transcriptional profiling reveals extracellular components and ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters gene enrichment in typhoid fever-infected Nigerian children.,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is a human-specific pathogen that causes typhoid fever, and remains a global health problem especially in developing countries. Its pathogenesis is complex and host response is poorly understood. In Africa, typhoid fever can be a major cause of morbidity in young infected children. The onset of the illness is insidious and clinical diagnosis is often unreliable. Gold standard blood culture diagnostic services are limited, thus rapid, sensitive, and affordable diagnostic test is essential in poor-resourced clinical settings. Routine typhoid fever vaccination is highly recommended but currently licensed vaccines provide only 55-75% protection. Recent epidemiological studies also show the rapid emergence of multi-drug resistant S. Typhi strains. High-throughput molecular technologies, such as microarrays, can dissect the molecular mechanisms of host responses which are S. Typhi-specific to provide a comprehensive genomic component of immunological responses and suggest new insights for diagnosis and treatment."

In the presence of fever in children from endemic areas, imported infectious diseases must be ruled out in the first place. We present two cases of typhoid fever in immigrant children, recently diagnosed in our centre. Both from countries with a high prevalence of the disease were admitted for study of fever of unknown origin. The two patients had been living in our country for less than one month. Isolation of the gram-negative bacillus in the blood cultures provided the key for reaching the etiological diagnosis. In both cases endovenous antibiotherapy was established and both the blood cultures and stools became negative before discharge. At present the two children are free of the disease."
CD008892,0,14978991,0,Pattern of nontyphoid ileal perforation over three decades in Pondicherry.,"Two hundred and twelve cases of ileal perforation due to different causes (excluding typhoid) were treated in 3 phases in the Department of Surgery, JIPMER Hospital, Pondicherry, during the periods 1966-78 (phase I), 1981-88 (phase II) and 1990-1998 (Phase III). Forty per cent of the patients were in the second and third decades of life. Male-to-female ratio was 2.2:1. The majority of the perforations (52.8%) were due to non-specific causes. Trauma (19.3%) and mechanical factors (12.7%) were the other principal aetiologies. Pain abdomen (92.3%), constipation (63.6%) and fever (44.3%) were the principal presenting features. Abdominal guarding and rigidity (89%) were the main physical signs. Pneumoperitoneum was present in 66.8% of cases on plain X-ray abdomen. Widal and blood culture for Salmonella typhi were negative in all. Laparotomy was done in most of the cases after adequate resuscitation. Simple closure of the perforation, wedge resection and resection anastomosis were the different procedures of management. Histology of the margin of perforation/excised gut gave added evidence of a non-typhoid etiology. Broad-spectrum antibiotics in different combinations with metronidazole were administered postoperatively. Mortality was 28.2% in Phase I, and 9.4% and 11.9% in phases II and III respectively. The lag period (advent of symptoms and hospitalization) showed definite relationship with mortality and morbidity. Wound infection, wound dehiscence, enterocutaneous fistula and septicaemia were the principal postoperative complications."
