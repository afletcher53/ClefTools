CD009786,0,16396153,0,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.,"Primary debulking surgery by a gynecologic oncologist remains the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer. Optimal debulking surgery should be defined as no residual tumor load. In retrospective analyses, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery does not seem to worsen prognosis compared to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, we will have to wait for the results of future randomized trials to know whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is as good as primary debulking surgery in stage IIIC and IV patients. Interval debulking is defined as an operation performed after a short course of induction chemotherapy. Based on the randomized European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Gynecological Cancer Group (EORTC-GCG) trial, interval debulking by an experienced surgeon improves survival in some patients who did not undergo optimal primary debulking surgery. Based on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 152 data, interval debulking surgery does not seem to be indicated in patients who underwent primarily a maximal surgical effort by a gynecologic oncologist. Open laparoscopy is probably the most valuable tool for evaluating the operability primarily or at the time of interval debulking surgery."
CD009786,0,15200789,0,Genital and peritoneal tuberculosis: potential role of laparoscopy in diagnosis and management.,"Genital and peritoneal tuberculosis are rare in developed countries and can mimic ovarian cancer. We report two different cases that came to our attention, both in a month. The first patient was referred to us for an asymptomatic pelvic mass. The second patient came to us because of weight loss, abdominal swelling, and ascites. Unfortunately, the imaging findings were misleading, and the laboratory analyses were not helpful. Only the laparoscopic approach was useful for final diagnosis. We conclude that the symptoms of abdominal tuberculosis vary greatly, and laparoscopy can be essential for its diagnosis and management."
CD009786,0,15200788,0,Laparoscopic management of teratoma of the round ligament.,"This paper describes the case of an asymptomatic woman who underwent laparoscopy as part of a work-up for infertility. A previous transvaginal ultrasound had shown an echogenic adnexal mass, independent of the ovary. The intraoperative finding was a tumor of the round ligament that was resected and determined to be a mature teratoma. The case is reported due to the unusual location for that type of tumor; and in addition, it is the first description of a teratoma in the round ligament managed by laparoscopy."

CD009786,0,19264478,0,Cryopreservation and autotransplantation of human ovarian tissue prior to cytotoxic therapy--a technique in its infancy but already successful in fertility preservation.,"Increasing survival rates in young cancer patients, new reproductive techniques and the growing interest in quality of life after gonadotoxic cancer therapies have placed fertility preservation as an important issue to oncologists, fertility specialists and patients. Several techniques are now available for fertility preservation in these patients. A new promising method is cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian cortex. Ovarian tissue can be extracted by laparoscopy without any significant delay of gonadotoxic therapy. The tissue can be cryopreserved by specialised centres of reproductive medicine and transplanted in case the women experience premature ovarian failure (POF). This review summarises the European expertise on cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian tissue, following around 30 reported transplantations globally, resulting in six live births and several ongoing pregnancies. It emphasises that fertility preservation by the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is a new but already a successful clinical option, which can be considered for selected cancer patients."
CD009786,0,7729731,0,Comparison between soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors and CA125 in peritoneal fluids as a marker for epithelial ovarian cancer.,"The levels of the soluble forms of the membrane-bound receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), p55 and p75, were assessed in peritoneal fluid samples from 50 patients with ovarian cancer, from 20 patients operated for benign pelvic masses, and from 26 healthy women undergoing laparoscopy. The 95% cutoff for normal levels were 14.0 and 5.2 ng/ml for p55 and p75, respectively. In patients with active ovarian cancer, elevated levels of p55 and p75 were found in 54 (p55) and 84% (p75) of the patients, and elevated levels were seen in all histologic types. The levels correlated with peritoneal fluid quantity and with stage of disease. Among 20 patients operated for benign pelvic masses, 1 patient had elevated p55 and 8 patients (40%) had elevated p75. The concentration of CA125 in peritoneal fluids showed a 95% cutoff value in healthy individuals of 8.950 U/ml; and elevated CA125 levels were found in 7 patients with ovarian cancer (14%) and in none of the patients with benign masses. The results indicate that in peritoneal fluid, measurement of soluble TNF receptors, and particularly of p75, has an increased sensitivity and accuracy over CA125 in distinguishing ovarian cancer from benign pelvic masses."

CD009786,0,876539,0,Progesterone production by an ovarian granulosa cell carcinoma.,"A patient with a progesterone-producing granulosa cell carcinoma is the basis of this report. Seven years after initial surgical therapy pelvic masses were palpated. At laparotomy the recurrence of tumor was confirmed, and many nonresectable metastases were discovered on the surface of the liver and on the mesentery of the bowel. An exceedingly high plasma progesterone level of 6270 pg/ml was obtained in the postoperative period. During 12 months of single agent chemotherapy with melphalan, serial plasma progesterone assays declined to 310 pg/ml. Complete tumor regression was subsequently confirmed by laparoscopy. Evaluation of progesterone levels in patients with granulosa cell tumors is recommended to determine the incidence of this finding and to further assess its value in following response to therapy."

CD009786,0,1457508,0,Surgery for gynecologic malignancies.,"The surgical management of invasive and preinvasive gynecologic malignancies continues to evolve at a brisk pace. Several good techniques are available for the treatment of preinvasive cervical disease, including cryotherapy, loop electrocautery excision, laser therapy, and standard knife conization. The use of radical surgery for early invasive cervical cancer has been extended to older women, and complications have been minimized. There has been a significant trend toward more conservative surgery in the management of invasive vulvar cancer. The new surgical staging system for endometrial cancer has generated much controversy. The importance of thorough surgical staging for ovarian cancer is clear, and our understanding of the role of cytoreduction has increased. The role of new techniques, including operative laparoscopy, is being defined in the management of gynecologic cancers."
CD009786,0,21889231,0,[Peritoneal strumosis: an extension study with (99m)Tc-pertecnectate].,"We report the case of a 35-year-old nulliparous woman, with a previous history of ovarian cystectomy diagnosed 3 years earlier due a struma ovarii type of monodermal teratoma in the right ovary and a hemorrhagic cyst in the left ovary. Progressive growth of the left adnexal mass was observed in the periodic medical check-ups. Due to this, a second laparoscopy was performed and, based on the findings, a left ovarian cystectomy, right salpingectomy and resection of multiple peritoneal implants were carried out. The pathology diagnosis was left struma ovarii and peritoneal strumosis. A whole body and SPECT/CT scan with (99m)Tc-pertechnetate was performed to detect possible peritoneal implants. This study helped to make the therapeutic decision."
CD009786,0,10378217,0,Laparoscopy in gynecologic malignancies.,"One of the cornerstones of gynecologic cancer surgery is the assessment and removal of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Numerous reports have demonstrated that, when performed by highly skilled individuals, laparoscopic lymphadenectomies can be performed safely. This has led to the investigation of laparoscopy in the surgical staging and treatment of patients with ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. This very promising approach has the potential to revolutionize numerous aspects of the management of gynecologic malignancies. However, it must be emphasized that the use of laparoscopy for gynecologic malignancies is still in its infancy. Studies that provide complication rates and long-term results are just beginning to be reported. More clinical data are necessary before the laparoscopic techniques are accepted as new surgical standards. Ongoing, prospective clinical trials will help answer many of the questions regarding the safety and efficacy of gynecologic laparoscopy. Until more data accumulate, operative laparoscopy will remain a promising, but unproven, tool in the management of patients with gynecologic malignancies."

CD009786,0,17339150,0,Primary leiomyoma of the fallopian tube: preoperative ultrasound findings.,"Leiomyoma of the fallopian tube is extremely rare. Most cases are asymptomatic and found incidentally at autopsy or unrelated operation. These leiomyomas tend to be singular, small, and unilateral, with a resultant rare preoperative diagnosis. They are often managed with laparotomy, as seen in the literature review. Therefore, preoperative imaging is never reported. We describe a case of leiomyoma of the fallopian tube, which was suspected before operation and treated by laparoscopic approach. Transvaginal ultrasound clearly showed a hypoechoic solid mass separate from the left ovary and uterus in a 44-year-old woman. Color Doppler ultrasound detected low impedance flow in this mass. Diagnostic laparoscopy and the follow-up laparoscopic salpingoectomy revealed a primary leiomyoma of the fallopian tube. We conclude that powerful ultrasound could be helpful in diagnosing rare gynecologic disorders but laparoscopy can be used for definite diagnosis and management of such disorders."

CD009786,0,19292804,0,Primary peritoneal serous carcinoma presenting as inflammatory breast cancer.,"Metastasis to the breast from extramammary malignancies is rare. Nevertheless, its recognition is important because the prognosis and treatment differ from that of primary breast cancer. We report a unique case of primary peritoneal serous carcinoma that initially presented as inflammatory breast cancer. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and subsequently underwent bilateral total mastectomy and bilateral sentinel lymph node biopsy. She was found to have extensive intralymphatic carcinoma in both breasts, with only focal minimal breast parenchymal involvement, and residual metastatic carcinoma in bilateral sentinel lymph nodes. Further work-up revealed pelvic ascites and omental nodularities. The patient underwent laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which revealed high-grade serous carcinoma involving both ovaries and fallopian tubes. Molecular testing of tumor from the ovary and axillary lymph node showed an identical pattern of allelic loss, confirming a common origin for both tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an extramammary primary malignancy that not only presented as inflammatory breast cancer but also was diagnosed and initially treated as such."

It is a more complex laparoscopic surgical procedure because of the adnexial lesions, now performed thank's to recent improved instrumentation. At the time of diagnosis, a complete evaluation of lesions appropriately staged according to the American Fertility Society classification scheme is necessary before destruction of endometriotic implants, adhesiolysis and ovarian cystectomy. CO2 videolaseroscopy with laser adhesiolysis and vaporization has been developed with precise destructions of disease tissue and minimal tissue reaction. Laser surgery with complex operative laparoscopy has many advantages: minimal damage of the adjacent normal tissue, minimal ovarian destruction, minimal bleeding and minimal postoperative adhesion formation."

CD009786,0,8881063,0,Port-site metastases of adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube after laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.,"Port-site metastases following laparoscopic surgery for cancer constitute an emerging problem. We report a case of cutaneous metastasis at a port site following laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy for unsuspected adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube. This complication occurred 7 months postoperatively and was treated with resection. A single site was involved. Possible etiologies are implantation from ""contaminated"" instruments or dissemination of tumor cells by the positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum. Preventive measures include precise and clean surgical technique, the use of a nonporous bag, postoperative trocar-site excision or irradiation, and conversion to laparotomy either intra- or postoperatively."
CD009786,0,12413936,0,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the management of ovarian cancer.,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to the administration of chemotherapy before definitive surgery is performed; this approach was introduced into the management of ovarian cancer approximately one decade ago, initially for use in women who were medically unable to tolerate aggressive cytoreductive surgery. Subsequently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was employed in women who, by diagnostic imaging analysis, were unlikely to undergo successful optimal cytoreductive surgery. Only very limited data are available on the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the management of women with apparent advanced ovarian cancer; these data are derived mainly from single institution experiences and suggest that this approach may increase disease-free survival but does not improve overall survival for the patient. However, it has consistently enhanced the feasibility of optimum surgical cytoreduction once neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been administered. Reduced blood loss, and shorter operations, intensive care unit stays and overall hospitalizations have been well documented. The methods for selecting candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy vary among institutions. Non-optimal surgical cytoreducibility has been assessed on the basis of diagnostic imaging studies, laparoscopic assessment and/or laparotomies. Currently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is most beneficial for women who are medically impaired and unable to tolerate aggressive cytoreductive surgery and for women who are found to have such aggressive cancers that optimal cytoreductive surgery does not appear by diagnostic imaging or direct visualization to be possible."

Pathological diagnosis was a renal cell carcinoma, clear cell subtype, pT3a, v(-), NO. One year later, abdominal ultrasound revealed a left ovarian tumor which had an enlargement tendency. A laparoscopic bilateral salpingooophorectomy was performed. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic ovarian renal cell carcinoma. This is the 20th case in the literature."
CD009786,0,9454432,0,[Massive edema of the ovary].,Massive edema of the ovary is a rare condition found in young women as a result of partial or intermittent torsion of the ovary. Differentiation of this entity from tumors of the ovary is important to prevent overtreatment. Organ-preserving surgical treatment is indicated as the correct approach to management. We present a case of massive edema of the ovary associated with post partum involution of the female genital tract and discuss the clinical features in the light of the known literature.
CD009786,0,18581767,0,Laparoscopic treatment of ovarian dermoid cysts.,"Dermoid cysts are the most common germ cell tumors of the ovary in women of reproductive age. We report 67 cases of patients with dermoid cysts (mean age, 31.31 years) originating from the ovary treated from 1994 to 2006 at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Aschaffenburg Hospital-Clinic in Germany. Most patients (60) underwent cyst removal. In two patients salpingo-oophorectomy was performed and in five partial oophorectomy was performed. Additional surgery ensuing laparotomy was never necessary. None of the patients had long-term postoperative complications. Two patients were at nine and 15 weeks of gestation and postoperatively were well following termination of pregnancy. In a group of 43 women, who desired pregnancy, 37 pregnancies resulted. The overall intrauterine pregnancy rate was 83.7%; one patient had an ectopic pregnancy (2.32%). To receive more information on this disease, treatment should be performed according to international protocols."

The safety and adequacy of pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy has been established by several investigators. Patients with early carcinoma of the cervix are now undergoing Schauta (radical vaginal) hysterectomy after laparoscopic lymphadenectomy. Patients with carcinoma of the endometrium are treated by laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy in conjunction with laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Staging and second-look procedures are now being performed laparoscopically in patients with carcinoma of the ovary. The Gynecologic Oncology Group is currently investigating the role of laparoscopic surgery for patients with carcinoma of the cervix, endometrium, and ovary in four Phase II trials. A randomized Phase III trial comparing laparoscopy to laparotomy for patients with carcinoma of the endometrium will begin soon."

CD009786,0,6299563,0,Ovarian cysts and masses: diagnosis using fine needle aspiration.,"The early diagnosis of ovarian tumors is hindered by the inaccessibility of the ovary by noninvasive techniques. The increasing popularity of fine needle biopsy and laparoscopy created a demand for using these techniques to diagnose ovarian masses. Ovarian masses were aspirated prior to, during, or after laparotomy and laparoscopy. The cases included a variety of nonneoplastic cysts and benign and malignant neoplasms. The nuclear and cytoplasmic features of the aspirated cells, the background material and the presence of other structures such as hair, and psammoma bodies and hyaline bodies made it possible to classify most tumors regarding their behaviors as well as their specific type. Malignant neoplasms in general produced more cellular specimens than benign tumors. It was difficult to differentiate between some types of sex cord/stroma neoplasms. Aspiration cytology, which can be performed through a laparoscope transvaginally, transrectally, or transabdominally is a safe, noninvasive, and relatively reliable technique. It should be utilized more in evaluating ovarian masses, when it is desirable to preserve ovarian function in young patients or to minimize surgical trauma to the elderly high-risk patients."

CD009786,0,15494657,0,[Management of malignant epithelial tumors of the ovary].,"The notoriously poor prognosis of ovarian cancer requires optimal management by a multidisciplinary gynecologic and oncologic surgical team. Ovarian cancers which appear to be of early stage must be accurately staged to be sure that no potential metastatic sites are missed. Such an omission may have grave consequences for disease progression and may reduce the chances of cure in young patients. With advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma, the challenge is to perform a detailed pre-operative staging of the extent of disease to enable neo-adjuvant chemotherapy when the disease is judged to be inoperable and/or the the general condition of the patient is unsuitable for surgery. Only patients who have had complete cytoreductive surgery to all affected areas in the abdomen can hope to have an acceptable 5 year survival rate of 50%."
CD009786,0,22744800,0,Misdiagnosed ectopic pregnancy mimicking adnexal malignancy: a report of two cases.,"We present two cases of nulliparous women with no history of amenorrhea who were referred to our unit following finding of a hypervascularized solid adnexal mass. In both cases a malignant tumor of tubal origin was suspected at transvaginal sonography. However, following laparoscopy, histological examination revealed that the masses were the result of an undetected tubal ectopic pregnancy that had failed spontaneously, with massive vasodilatation of pelvic blood vessels surrounding the trophoblastic tissue. We recommend consideration of the potential diagnosis of a previously undetected, failed tubal ectopic pregnancy in fertile women presenting with an adnexal mass, even when there is no history of amenorrhea or a positive pregnancy test."
CD009786,0,2954861,0,Management of unexpected ovarian dermoid cyst during laparoscopy for oocyte pickup.,"In conclusion, management of unexpected SDT during OPU include the following therapeutic goals: (1) complete eradication of the tumor to eliminate the remote possibility of malignancy and recurrence; (2) performance of adequate peritoneal lavage to prevent chemical peritonitis; (3) conservation of the maximum amount of functional ovarian tissue; and (4) exclusion of the possibility of dermoid cyst in the contralateral ovary. If laparoscopic drainage of a SDT, marsupialization, and adequate fulguration of cystic wall provide a low incidence of recurrence, the risk of oophorectomy and the necessity of laparotomy will be avoided. The aspirate contents should be examined and histopathologic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and exclusion of a malignant process should always be performed. The laparoscopic approach must be investigated further to determine its efficacy compared with the conventional approach."

CD009786,0,16966069,0,Image guided biopsy in the management of cancer of the ovary.,"When used in the context of multidisciplinary team discussion, image guided biopsy using ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) guidance is of value in planning management of women with suspected ovarian cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of uncertain aetiology. It is essential in women believed to have ovarian cancer but with poor performance status or with advanced disease believed beyond the scope of primary cytoreductive surgery for whom staging surgical pathology will not be obtained. It provides a site-specific primary tumour diagnosis in 93% of cases and it should replace diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy for this purpose. It allows provision of primary (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy based on a firm histological diagnosis. It is mandatory in women with a history of cancer whose metastases may mimic ovarian cancer (e.g. breast, GI tract, melanoma). More women with prior breast cancer who re-present with peritoneal cancer will have a new gynaecological primary than recurrence of their original primary tumour; the two options require radically different therapies. Finally it is a valuable problem solving tool in situations of diagnostic uncertainty, e.g. unusual imaging patterns of disease such as PC with bilateral solid ovarian masses or non-enlarged ovaries and with an unusual tumour marker profiles suggesting primary tumours outwith the ovary. The technique is simple, safe and effective and can be combined with palliative drainage of ascites at the same procedure."

CD009786,0,7556836,0,Laparoscopic management of malignant ovarian cysts: a 78-case national survey. Part 2: Follow-up and final treatment.,"This paper reports a retrospective multi-institutional French survey carried out in 1992 to determine the incidence of laparoscopic management of malignant ovarian cysts. Of 5307 ovarian lesions treated endoscopically, 78 were malignant (1.47%) including 60 borderline tumours (77%) and 18 ovarian cancers (23%). Laparoscopic treatment was puncture in 23% of cases, partial exeresis in 51% and total removal in 26%. Laparotomy was immediately performed in 25% of the cases and as a second stage procedure in 58% (mean delay: 78 days). Laparotomy was not performed in 16% of the cases. Our findings suggest that laparoscopic management of ovarian lesions that subsequently prove to be malignant is not uncommon. To prevent the risk of metastasis, thorough pre-operative and per-operative evaluation is mandatory. In 22.4% of the patients presenting lesions in this study, laparoscopic tampering resulted in an upgrading of FIGO stage."

One patient is a phenotypic female with karyotype 45,X/46,X,idic(Y)(q11.2). She underwent a laparoscopic gonadectomy at which streak ovaries without evidence of gonadoblastoma were removed. The second patient presented as a virilised female with karyotype 45,X/47,XYY. At laparoscopy, she was found to have mixed gonadal dysgenesis with a gonadoblastoma in situ. We recommend early gonadectomy in female children presenting with gonadal dysgenesis and the presence of a Y chromosome although once the gonadoblastoma locus on Y chromosome gene has been cloned it may be possible to identify those patients who have a low risk of developing gonadoblastoma."

Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent further sequelae including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Not all patients, however, present with pelvic pain, pelvic mass, fever, and leukocytosis. We present the case of a sexually active 15-year-old black girl who presented with mild abdominal pain and excessive vaginal bleeding without pelvic mass, fever, or leukocytosis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 66 mm/h. Pelvic ultrasound revealed bilateral complex ovarian masses. At laparoscopy, the patient had bilateral tuboovarian abscesses with extensive adhesions to the pelvic side walls. This case illustrates the need for a high index of suspicion of tuboovarian abscess in sexually active adolescents."

We believe that its occurrence during pregnancy has not been previously reported. The patient was a 32-year-old woman who during her pregnancy was noted to have a progressively enlarging, unilocular left ovarian cyst. Beginning at 18 weeks gestation, the fetus required multiple platelet transfusions for severe alloimmune thrombocytopenia. A viable baby girl was delivered by cesarean section at 39 weeks gestation. At that time, an ovarian cystectomy also was performed. When the histology of the tissue subsequently became known, a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed for gynandroblastoma.

Accidental cyst rupture was more frequent when a total laparoscopic approach was used (26/174 or 15% versus 39/140 or 28%; P = 0.005), but there were no cases of intraperitoneal spillage when an endoscopic bag was used. Two cases of granulomatous peritonitis developed out of 26 women with intraperitoneal spillage of cyst contents (8%).

CD009786,0,15495639,0,[Anaphylactic reaction versus carcinoid crisis: the role of octreotide as a vasoconstrictor].,"A 35-year-old woman was scheduled for laparoscopic removal of an ovarian tumor. Intravenous metamizol was administered and when pneumoperitoneum was performed she developed severe hypotension and bronchospasm. Anaphylactic reaction was suspected, all drugs were suspended, and 2 doses of intravenous adrenalin (0.2 and 1 mg) were injected followed by continuous perfusion. Because response was slow and given the unknown origin of the tumor, the possibility of a carcinoid crisis was considered. When an intravenous bolus dose of octreotide was administered, pressure recovered, patient was extubated and could be transferred asymptomatic to the recovery ward. Tests later ruled out carcinoid syndrome, whereas tryptase levels in blood extracted during surgery and allergy tests confirmed an anaphylactic reaction to metamizol. Carcinoid crisis can be difficult to distinguish from anaphylactic reaction because the clinical pictures are similar. Anesthetic management of carcinoid crisis has been facilitated by administration of octreotide. Less is known about the use of octreotide to treat hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy based mainly on the drug's ability to produce splanchnic vasoconstriction. This is probably the reason why octreotide resolved our patient's shock in a context of systemic vasodilation caused by the anaphylactic reaction."

Individual and regional variation in surgical practice and factors influencing surgical practice were assessed. A postal questionnaire was sent to all 1536 consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology currently practising in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with a 52.7% response rate. Approximately 60% of hysterectomies were abdominal, 37% vaginal and 4% laparoscopic-assisted, with junior consultants performing a greater proportion of hysterectomies vaginally. There was a wide variation in method of hysterectomy, both individually and regionally. Only 21% of consultants would routinely consider performing prophylactic oophorectomy and of these the majority would perform this procedure in women aged between 46 and 50 years old. This large variation in surgical practice indicates a need to form a consensus on optimal surgical techniques and to ensure adequate surgical training for all gynaecologists."
CD009786,0,22543911,0,Inherited risk of ovarian cancer and the implications for screening.,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is a disease normally diagnosed at late stages, when survival rates are particularly poor. Diagnostic screening strategies are currently ineffective at detecting diseases at the earliest most treatable stages. This is confounded by the relative rarity of the disease. Stratifying the population according to genetic, lifestyle, and/or epidemiological risk factors could improve early-stage screening approaches by enriching the population for individuals at greatest disease risk. If lifetime risks are substantial, surgical interventions such as laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy could be offered to women to eliminate altogether their risks of primary cancer of the ovary. There have been significant recent advances in characterizing genetic risk factors for a multitude of cancers, including ovarian cancer. This research has been driven by technological advances that enable very high throughput DNA scanning approaches in tens of thousands of subjects. This article summarizes the progress in identifying genetic alleles for ovarian cancer in the population and the implications for clinical intervention strategies based on identifying the proportion of the population at greatest risk of disease."

Laparoscopy has multiple benefits in the cancer patients, including image magnification to visualize metastatic or recurrent disease and improved dissection in challenging areas such as the paravesical and pararectal spaces. There is limited bleeding from small vessels because of the pressure from pneumoperitoneum, decreased hospital stay, and rapid recovery. Postoperative chemotherapy or radiation can be initiated earlier, and radiation complications from bowel adhesions are minimized. Significant progress has been made in the last 2 decades in gynecologic malignancy. In this study, the application of laparoscopy in cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer will be presented."

CD009786,0,8218501,0,Surgery for gynecologic malignancies.,"There is almost universal acceptance of the importance of cytoreductive surgery in advanced ovarian cancer. However, recent studies argued against attempts to remove every last vestige of tumor in patients with many large tumor masses in the upper abdomen. Successful secondary cytoreduction at second surgery may improve survival in some selected patients. The change from a clinical to a surgical staging for endometrial neoplasia undoubtedly improved the accuracy of staging, but it remains to be seen if appropriate clinical treatment of high-risk patients improves survival. Large loop excision of the transformation zone has become increasingly popular for treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Lesions with no more than a 3-mm depth of invasion and with no vascular space involvement may be treated by simple hysterectomy. The morbidity and postoperative mortality with treatment of invasive squamous carcinoma of the vulva have been reduced by modifying the extent of vulvar and groin dissection. Recent studies suggested that the femoral nodes should be removed when performing inguinal lymphadenectomy. Laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomies and even laparoscopically assisted radical hysterectomies have been reported in patients with gynecologic malignancies.

CD009786,0,20473276,0,Evaluation of vascular space involvement in endometrial adenocarcinomas: laparoscopic vs abdominal hysterectomies.,"Recent reports have described 'vascular pseudoinvasion' in total laparoscopic hysterectomies with endometrial carcinoma. To better understand this phenomenon, we compared pathologic findings in these laparoscopic and total abdominal hysterectomies performed for uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Reports from 58 robotically assisted laparoscopic and 39 abdominal hysterectomies with grade 1 or 2 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinomas were reviewed for stage, depth of invasion, vascular space involvement, uterine weight, and lymph node metastases. In addition, attention was given to possible procedural artifacts, including vertical endomyometrial clefts, and inflammatory debris, benign endometrial glands, and disaggregated tumor cells in vascular spaces. All foci with vascular involvement were reviewed by three gynecologic pathologists. Nine of the 58 (16%) laparoscopic and 3 of the 39 (7%) abdominal hysterectomies contained vascular space involvement based on the original pathology reports (P-value=0.0833). No one histologic feature consistently distinguished laparoscopic from abdominal cases on blind review of the available cases. Disaggregated intravascular tumor cells were significantly associated with reported vascular involvement in both procedures (P-values<0.001 and 0.016), most of which were corroborated on review. Laparoscopic procedures tend to have a higher index of vascular involvement, which is associated with lower stage, fewer lymph node metastases, and less myometrial invasion; however, pathologists cannot consistently determine the procedure on histologic findings alone. Moreover, there is significant inter-observer variability in distinguishing true from artifactual vascular space involvement, even among pathologists at the same institution. The clinical significance of apparent true vascular space involvement seen adjacent to artifacts is unclear, as is the impact of laparoscopic hysterectomy on recurrence risk."

Lymph nodes were free from invasion. A 7 cm ovarian cyst developed during follow-up and after a 2 month regimen of lynestrenol, coelioscopy with peritoneal lavage was performed. The pathology diagnosis was papillary cystadenocarcinoma requiring laparotomy which revealed invasion of both ovaries, neoplasic granulations and involvements of the epiloon. Exceresis of the trocar tract also showed tumoural invasion. Pathology examination favoured metastatic extension of the breast cancer. A 6-month chemotherapy was programmed before a second look. This case illustrates the risk of neoplastic dissemination after puncture or rupture of a cyst misdiagnosed as benign. In patients with a history of breast cancer, the risk of discovering a primary malignant ovarian cancer at coelioscopy is 9%. Metastases are found in 15-30% of the cases compared with 0.4 to 1.8% in unselected subjects. Prevention of operative dissemination relies on cystectomy without opening the cyst. This may require transforming the coelioscopy into a laparotomy which should not be considered as an operative failure but as a necessary method of preventing dissemination and clinical aggravation. Careful history taking, a rigorous coelioscopy technique and extension to laparotomy in cases with suspected diffusion should reduce the number of dramatic situations where the malignant process had not been suspected in the precoelioscopic diagnosis."

The antibodies used were Ca 1 or Ca 2, anti-CEA, and HMFG-2 or E29. All these are directed against epithelial antigens and are expressed on most malignant epithelial cells and weakly or not at all on mesothelial cells. It was hoped that these reactions would confirm diagnoses made by conventional cytology and possibly show malignant cells which had not already been identified. Of 28 patients with malignant disease (chosen to exclude any with frank ascites), eight gave positive immunochemical reactions, only four having been reported positive from conventional examination. Of 77 patients without malignant disease, HMFG-2 or E29 gave positive reactions in seven, Ca 1 or Ca 2 in two, and anti-CEA in two (reactions with plasma cells being disregarded). Some misleading reactions were probably due to endometrial cells. It was concluded that the antibodies used in this study are not sufficiently specific or sensitive to allow immunocytochemical staining to replace conventional cytological diagnosis but are a useful supplementary aid."

Because of its rarity and the absence of typical symptoms, preoperative diagnosis is seldom made. Patient as well as physician delay in diagnosis is often considerable. There are no reliable laboratory aids available to enhance the discovery of this tumor. However, routine periodic pelvic examinations with laparoscopic examination of any significant adnexal enlargement in postmenopausal women should decrease the discovery time. Certainly, unexplained vaginal discharge or bleeding particularly when associated with a pelvic mass, should increase one's suspicion. Conventional surgical treatment can be curative if the tumor has not exceeded the confines of the tube and has not involved the serosa. Regardless, the prognosis for patients with primary carcinoma of the fallopian tube is grim."

Her serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 was greater than 900 U/ml, but laparoscopic examination of the ovaries was normal. Her breast cancer was deemed metastatic by virtue of a supraclavicular lymph node, but she had no visceral or bone metastasis. She was begun on primary chemotherapy and her CA 125 normalized. CA 125 is a tumor-associated antigen that is most commonly seen in advanced ovarian cancer. It is predominantly derived from coelomic epithelium, which explains elevations in benign conditions or other malignancies. The significance of CA 125 elevations in breast cancer is uncertain. Although CA 125 production has been demonstrated in the normal breast, it has been reported most often as a marker of pleural involvement with metastatic breast cancer.

She was treated with intravenous antibiotics until resolution of symptoms. The pain recurred 1 month later, and the patient presented to our emergency department. At that time, she was afebrile and all laboratory results were normal or negative, aside from an elevated white blood cell count. Computed tomography suggested a right ovarian dermoid. At laparoscopy, however, the right tube and ovary were normal, and chronic appendicitis was confirmed.

A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all patients with apparent stage I epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent laparoscopic (laparoscopy group) or laparotomic (laparotomy group) surgical staging at the Center for Uterine Cancer, National Cancer Center, Korea, between January 2001 and August 2006. During the study period, 19 patients underwent laparotomic surgical staging and 17 patients underwent laparoscopic surgical staging. No cases were converted from laparoscopy to laparotomy. The two groups were similar in terms of age, body mass index, procedures performed, number of lymph nodes retrieved, and operating time. The laparoscopy group had less estimated blood loss (P = 0.001), faster return of bowel movement (P < 0.001), and a shorter postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.002) compared to the laparotomy group. Transfusions were required only in two laparotomy patients, and postoperative complications occurred only in four laparotomy patients. However, two patients with stage IA grade 1 and 2 disease in laparoscopy group had recurrence with one patient dying of disease. The accuracy and adequacy of laparoscopic surgical staging were comparable to laparotomic approach, and the surgical outcomes were more favorable than laparotomic approach. However, the oncologic safety of laparoscopic staging was not certain. This is the first report on the possible hazards of laparoscopic staging in early-stage ovarian cancer. In the absence of a large prospective trial, this technique should be performed cautiously."

A hypoplastic uterus with normal looking Fallopian tubes and bilateral adnexal tumors were detected through laparoscopy. A laparotomy was performed and the streak gonads with bilateral gonadoblastoma were removed. This led to a normalisation of serum testosterone and serum beta-HCG levels and an amelioration of signs of virilisation. Uterus and fallopian tubes were conserved during the operation.

In a follow up study containing 92 patients with CR after cis platine chemotherapy it has been evident that the remission time is independent on the kind of invasive diagnostic methods. In contrast to these results the noninvasive diagnostic methods (like CT or X ray in 19 pat.) survival time was 20 months. The difference to both other groups is significant.

Of 12 patients (58%) believed to have disease localized to the pelvis (stage 1 or II) at laparotomy staging 7 were found to have more advanced disease (stage III) at peritoneoscopy and thus required a change in therapy. Involvement of the diaphragm with metastatic ovarian carcinoma was found in 63% of all patients. This finding again necessitated a change in therapy, since the right hemidiaphragm is shielded along with the liver when abdominal radiotherapy is used. Peritoneoscopy supplied the only followable findings with which to gauge response to therapy in 40% of the patients and also supplied followable findings in 78% of all patients studied. Second-look peritoneoscopy was performed in all patients achieving an apparent clinical remission with chemotherapy. Active disease was found in 43% of these patients, which thus precluded the need for laparotomy."

CD009786,0,9050665,0,Laparoscopic removal of a 103-pound ovarian tumor.,"The surgical removal of extremely large abdominopelvic masses is associated with a high perioperative complication rate related to massive physiologic and anatomic distortions. The judicious use of minimally invasive techniques in carefully selected patients may diminish the convalescent stresses inherent to laparotomy. We removed a 103-pound benign, ovarian mucinous cystadenoma from a 22-year-old woman by laparoscopy. We believe this is the largest such tumor removed by this method, and it raises several issues relevant to the intraoperative and perioperative management of such neoplasms. Systematic laparoscopic drainage and excision of extremely large, benign, abdominopelvic tumors is not only feasible, but is a reproducible, safe, low-morbidity alternative to initial laparotomy in the treatment of these rare lesions."

The mean operating time for aquadissection was 59.3 minutes compared with 78.4 minutes for blunt dissection and scissors (p <0.05). Intraoperative spillage was significantly less common with aquadissection because with this method it is easier to avoid cyst rupture. No complication occurred with either method. Hospital stay was similar in both groups. Operative laparoscopy is a safe and effective method in the management of ovarian dermoid cysts."

Over the past several decades surgical therapy has shifted from a radical approach to more conservative treatment. There are various modes of surgery applied to the patients. All these developments have to be considered from an oncologic standpoint as BOTs represent a potentially malignant disease. Oncologic safety, as well as patients' desires and expectations, have to be balanced to reach the most appropriate treatment for BOTs. For this reason current literature will be discussed in this review to give a thorough overview of this topic and to develop recommendations for the surgical management of these patients.

CD009786,0,10975556,0,Surgical standards in the management of ovarian cancer.,"Surgery is the cornerstone of management of epithelial ovarian cancer and has broad applications throughout the clinical course of disease, from initial diagnosis to palliative care. Comprehensive surgical staging is essential for precise prognostic determination and treatment planning for patients with apparent early-stage ovarian cancer. Although randomized trials are lacking, the survival advantage associated with optimal primary cytoreduction has been consistent and reproducible. With increasing radicality of cytoreductive surgical techniques and sophistication of postoperative care, it appears that an ""optimal"" surgical procedure is that which leaves the patient with no visible residual disease. The survival benefits of cytoreductive surgery are also applicable to women with stage IV ovarian cancer, although the rate of success is somewhat attenuated compared with patients with stage III disease. Recent data also indicate that with appropriate surgical selection criteria, secondary cytoreduction is associated with a significant prolongation of survival for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, several recent publications illustrate how the decentralization of health care may have significant ramifications on the ability of women with known or suspected ovarian cancer to avail themselves of the surgical standard of care."

It occurs most often in - and postmenopausal women. We report a case of a 64 year-old woman with signs of virilisation that had started 3 years before. Blood hormone analysis revealed increased levels of testosterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. The tetracosactin test revealed 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Radiological imaging demonstrated a nodule in her left ovary. The patient was submitted to bilateral laparoscopic oophorectomy, and histopathological examination revealed a luteoma of the left ovary. Postoperative serum testosterone level and 17-hydroxyprogesterone returned to normal levels in one month. Virilism regressed within six months. Our patient also showed an elevation in 17-OHP serum levels. Normalization of 17-OHP after oophorectomy suggests a case of intratumoral 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

In the case of the 18-year-old patient described here, on the basis of the preoperative data the suspected clinical diagnosis was polycystic ovarian (PCO) syndrome. In the MRI the enlarged ovary was interpreted as a mucous tumour. The laparotomy showed a smooth-walled, opalescent ovarian tumour with adnexal torsion. Histopathological examination of the adnexectomy specimen gave the diagnosis of a massive ovarian edema (MOE). Therapeutically, a wedge-shaped excision, immediate-section histology and derotation and suspension of the ovary would have been sufficient.

Due to the absence of specific preoperative criteria, diagnosis is often made during surgery or after the anatomopathologic examination. The management of borderline ovarian tumors with early stage is well-known and conservative surgery must be chosen as much as possible. Laparoscopic approach is possible for these tumors, allowing diagnosis, staging and also treatment. For advanced stage, laparotomy is still recommended. Staging must be performed during the initial surgery because tumor stage is one of the most relevant prognostic factors. Restaging operation should be discussed when complete staging was not made during initial surgery. Because his prognostic and therapeutic impacts are not proved, restaging surgery remains controversial. For that reason, it seems important to define clinical and histological criteria for patients with a high risk of upstaging."

CD009786,0,8786211,0,Aspiration cytology of neoplastic and non-neoplastic ovarian cysts: is it accurate?,"To evaluate the role of aspiration cytology in the distinction between neoplastic and non-neoplastic ovarian cysts, we examined the cytology of 81 aspirates from 80 women 14-67 years of age. We then correlated results with subsequent histology or the clinical follow-up. Aspiration were performed during laparoscopy (32 cases) or immediately after surgical removal of the tumors (49 cases). The cysts ranged in size from 1.0 to 43.0 cm. Papanicolaou-stained cytospin preparations of samples were evaluated, and the lesions were classified into non-neoplastic (68 cases), benign neoplasms (four cases), and malignant neoplasms (nine cases). Cytologic impressions were correlated with histologic findings in 74 cases and with the clinical follow-up in the remaining seven. Nine of the 12 (75%) cystadenocarcinomas, including two serous neoplasms of low malignant potential (LMP), were correctly diagnosed as malignant by cytology. There were no false-positive results. On the other hand, of the 26 benign neoplasms (19 cystadenomas and seven mature cystic teratomas), only four teratomas (15%) could be subclassified specifically. The remaining 68 aspirates were classified as non-neoplastic. Seventy-seven percent of all proven non-neoplastic cysts measured < 8.0 cm, whereas 77% of all benign and malignant neoplastic cysts were > 8.0 cm. The overall diagnostic accuracy was improved from 63% to 69% when cyst size was taken into consideration. In malignant cysts the diagnostic sensitivity was 75%, specificity 100%, and overall accuracy 96%. We arrived at the following conclusions: Aspiration cytology is an accurate predictor of malignancy in ovarian cystic lesions, but because the sensitivity of the technique is not high enough, one should not rely on aspiration cytology alone; The differential diagnosis between cystadenocarcinomas and tumors of low malignant potential cannot be made by cytology; Although it is difficult to distinguish between benign neoplasms and non-neoplastic benign cysts, diagnostic accuracy will improve when the size of the lesion is considered; Aspiration cytology can provide particularly useful information in young women with functional cysts of the ovary to avoid an unnecessary operation; Acellular cyst fluids should not be considered nondiagnostic because they represent benign cysts in the majority of cases; false-negative results of fine-needle aspiration of cystic ovarian lesions is usually due to low cellularity of the sample and secondary degenerative changes; negative fine-needle aspiration results should be followed clinically."

One hundred four laparoscopic procedures were performed. Eleven of these procedures were converted to laparotomy due to severe adhesions. Therefore, a total of 88 reassessment laparotomies were performed during the study period. Fifty-seven of 93 laparoscopies and 69 of 88 laparotomies were done as second-look procedures. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to patient age, tumor histology, degree of primary cytoreduction, and tumor stage or grade. Significant differences were found between laparoscopy and laparotomy groups in the following outcome variables evaluated: estimated blood loss (33.9 ml vs 164.9 ml, P = 0.0001), operative time (81.3 min vs 130.4 min, P = 0.0001), days of hospitalization (0.3 days vs 6.8 days, P = 0.0001), and direct cost/case ($2765 vs $5420, P = 0.0001). Despite obtaining 50% fewer biopsies with laparoscopy than laparotomy, the ability to detect disease was similar between these two groups: 47.3% vs 55.7% for all procedures and 52.6% vs 53.6% in the patients undergoing second-look procedures. Major complications in the laparoscopy group included transverse colon perforation (1), small bowel perforation (2), enterocutaneous fistula (1), and a retroperitoneal hematoma (1). Major complications in the laparotomy group included cystotomy (1), left ureteral injury (1), enterotomy (2), and SBO (4). Laparoscopy, when technically feasible, appears equally as effective as laparotomy in detecting persistent or recurrent malignant disease with less blood loss, less days spent in the hospital, less financial burden, and no increase in patient morbidity."
CD009786,0,6220938,0,[Cyto-diagnosis of cystic ovarian tumours].,"The value of aspiration cytology of cystic ovarian tumours was studied, as an aid to the differential diagnosis between functional ovarian cysts and cystic ovarian tumours. In 158 women age 14 age 77 the cystic ovarian tumour was aspirated by laparoscopy or at laparotomy and the contents of the cyst were centrifuged and the sediment investigated by papanicolaou cytology. The findings of the smears showed direct or indirect cytological criteria for a cystic ovarian tumour. In 47 cystic neoplasms verified by microscopic examination the cytological diagnosis showed conclusive evidence of a neoplasm in 27 cases. In 7 cases the cytology was suspicious of a neoplasm. In 36 cases the differential diagnosis between cystic tumour and functional cyst was supplemented by radio-immuno-assay for estradiol in the aspirated contents of the cysts. Values over 500 picomol/litre are suggestive of a follicle are corpus luteum cyst."

CD009786,0,8039002,0,[Operative laparoscopy: genuine surgical advance or simple temptation by the feasible?].,"Laparoscopic surgery appears now to be not just a series of simple modifications to operative techniques, but more truly a revolution. This is due to three factors: the simultaneous diagnosis of lesions, establishment of the prognosis and actual treatment: greater respect for the anatomy and physiological processes; the shift in the theatre of operations which is now represented by the pelvis itself and not the operating room we were used to. This surgical revolution has achieved a number of indisputable advances, especially where the adnexa are concerned. Tubo-peritoneal infertility, of course, for which Raoul Palmer developed laparoscopy; the approach relies on a thorough knowledge of the tubal condition. Ectopic pregnancy where laparoscopic treatment has become the standard. Ovarian cysts which raise the specific problems of discovering, and even more important, overlooking malignancy. Endometriosis for which surgical treatment has become appropriate again thanks to endoscopy. This revolutionary cycle is not yet complete for subperitoneal surgery is now being addressed. Hysterectomy, so highly symbolic for the gynecologist, is now regularly carried out in this manner. Even cancer surgery may now employ endoscopy, with second-look laparoscopy for ovarian cancer and above all lymphadenectomy techniques which were developed for a large part in France and will no doubt bring about a total change in the strategies for surgical treatment of cancer. Once the technical difficulties have been resolved radical hysterectomy has the potential to become the reference thanks to its precision and radicality. Prolapse too can draw benefit from endoscopic surgery. This is already the case for colpocervical suspension and other factors concerning prolapse are under study. We must not forget that this surgery must not only comply with the standard rules for surgery, but must also benefit from regulated and rigorous training. Collaboration with the engineers and equipment manufacturers is yet another new element with which French medicine is not yet very familiar."
CD009786,0,18584410,0,A case of metastatic struma ovarii treated with 131I therapy: focus on preservation of fertility and selected review of the literature.,"Struma ovarii is a rare monodermal ovarian teratoma composed predominantly of mature thyroid tissue. We describe herein the case of a 22-year-old woman who underwent a right salpingo-oophorectomy for struma ovarii at the age of 12 years, who was admitted 8 years later with signs and symptoms of a left pelvic tumor. Laparoscopy detected a left ovarian endometriotic cyst and multiple nodules on the pelvic peritoneum, right lateral abdominal wall, diaphragm, vesical plica and liver. The diagnosis was abdominal and pelvic widespread dissemination of recurrent struma ovarii, with features consistent with the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient was treated with a combination of conservative surgery and two 131I administrations (cumulative activity of 350 mCi after dosimetric evaluation). Because of the high degree of hormonogenesis shown by the metastases, the first administration was performed following use of recombinant human (rh) thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to reach adequate TSH levels. To avoid the 'stunning effect' and to obtain high-quality scintigraphy, a whole-body scan was performed with 123I after rh-TSH and before the 131I therapy. We also discuss the potential role and the possible benefit of using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and ovarian tissue cryopreservation to preserve fertility in women treated with 131I for pelvic metastases from malignant struma ovarii."
CD009786,0,22117832,0,Laparoscopic treatment of ovarian dermoid cysts is a safe procedure.,"Experienced laparoscopic surgeons should consider laparoscopy as an alternative to laparotomy in management of ovarian dermoid cysts in selected cases. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety of laparoscopy in ovarian dermoid cysts treatment and risk of chemical peritonitis. We report 63 cases of patients (mean age of 37) with ovarian dermoid cysts originating from the ovary, treated from 2002 to 2010. Most of the patients underwent cysts removal. In 7 patients salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. We used 15 mm trocars for removing specimens. In patients with dermoid cyst rupture peritoneal cavity was washed out thoroughly with Ringer lactate and drained for 24-48 hours. All the material extracted was sent for a histopathology examination. The diagnosis of mature ovarian dermoid cysts was confirmed in 58 (92.63%) of cases and immature ovarian dermoid cysts in 5 (7.37%) cases. Dermoid cysts were composed of tissue developed from three germinative layers in 31 (49%) patients, from two germinative layers in 25 (40%), and in 7 (11%) patients from one germinative layer. No intra or postoperative complications occurred. No signs or symptoms of chemical peritonitis were observed regardless of cystic spillage or not. We conclude that the risk of chemical peritonitis can be minimized when undertaking laparoscopic removal of ovarian dermoid cysts if the peritoneal cavity is washed out thoroughly from spillage of cyst contents. Drainage of peritoneal cavity should be performed in the patients with the ruptured dermoid cysts."

CD009786,0,17922452,0,[Acute renal failure after videolaparoscopic surgery: an avoidable complication?].,"Videolaparoscopic surgery exposes the abdominal organs to the mechanical effect of pneumoperitoneum at pressure values between 12 and 15 mm Hg, which are considered safe. Nevertheless, experimental data have shown that this pressure range can represent a hemodynamic risk factor as it may induce a decrease in the venous return to the right ventricle, a decrease in cardiac output, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin angiotensin system. We report two cases of acute renal failure that occurred soon after videolaparoscopy in young female patients without any evidence of ongoing renal disease. Patient A was 29 years old and was submitted to videolaparoscopic surgery in a follow-up program after surgical treatment of ovarian cancer; patient B was 15 years old and was submitted to the surgical removal of a monolateral ovarian cyst. In neither of the cases was it necessary to perform hemodialysis. Patient A underwent a renal biopsy under ultrasound guidance; optic microscopy showed only in ra- and extraglomerular capillary congestion. In both cases the acute renal failure resolved completely and the patients where discharged with normal renal function. Taking in to account that normal renal venous pressure levels are around 4 mmHg we think that a) a 15 mmHg pneumoperitoneum may represent a risk factor during videolaparoscopic surgery mainly if the patient's extracellular volume is not properly expanded; b) administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in order to prevent surgical pain may inhibit vasodilatory prostaglandin availability; c) onset of oliguria during the surgical procedure suggests that extracellular volume expansion is required."

CD009786,0,6147640,0,Randomised trial comparing two combination chemotherapy regimens (Hexa-CAF vs CHAP-5) in advanced ovarian carcinoma.,"186 patients with advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma were treated with either a combination of hexamethylmelamine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (Hexa-CAF) or cyclophosphamide and hexamethylmelamine alternating with doxorubicin and a 5-day course of cisplatin (CHAP-5). Treatment with CHAP-5 resulted in more complete remissions as determined by laparatomy or peritoneoscopy (p = 0.004), better overall response (p = 0.0001), and longer overall survival and progression-free survival (p less than 0.002). Therapy, histological grade, and Karnofsky index were reliable predictors of overall response, whereas therapy, FIGO-stage, and size of residual tumour before chemotherapy were independent predictors for complete remission and for prolonged survival. Peripheral neurotoxicity was a major problem in patients assigned to the CHAP-5-group and was likely to be due to the simultaneous administration of hexamethylmelamine and cisplatin. The CHAP-5 regimen is one of the most effective regimens for the initial treatment of ovarian cancer."

CD009786,0,3373267,0,The impact of aggressive debulking surgery and cisplatin-based chemotherapy on progression-free survival in stage III and IV ovarian carcinoma.,"Forty consecutive patients with stage III and IV invasive ovarian carcinoma were treated on a phase II protocol consisting of optimal debulking surgery, induction cisplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (PAC) chemotherapy, 6-month interval laparoscopy, reinduction cisplatin, PAC chemotherapy, and second-look procedure. All 40 patients have either disease progression or have completed the 12-month protocol. Eighty-seven percent of the patients (35) underwent optimal (less than or equal to 2 cm residual) debulking surgery before chemotherapy, in spite of the fact that 50% (20) were referred to Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) as inoperable after initial surgery elsewhere. There were no postoperative deaths and chemotherapy was started in less than or equal to 14 days in 97% of the patients. Of the 40 patients, 30% (12) achieved a pathologic complete remission (11) or a clinical complete remission (one patient refused second-look surgery). The estimated 3-year survival rate was 62%, but the 3-year progression-free survival rate was only 29%. The median survival time was 48 months. The estimated 3-year progression-free survival rate was 31% for residual disease less than or equal to 2 cm. For the five patients with residual disease greater than 2 cm, four died within 3 years. The median survival time of patients with less than or equal to 2 cm residual disease was 48 months, as compared with 21 months for those with greater than 2 cm residual disease. Although the estimated 3-year survival rate of 62% is noteworthy, the 3-year progression-free survival rate of only 29% is probably indicative that in spite of extensive debulking surgery and cisplatin-based chemotherapy as used in this protocol, the long range proportion of patients ""cured"" will remain small."

CD009786,0,2213099,0,Intraperitoneal lymphokine-activated killer-cell and interleukin-2 therapy for malignancies limited to the peritoneal cavity.,"Autologous lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) were administered intraperitoneally (IP) to 24 patients with malignancies limited to the peritoneal space. Ten patients had ovarian cancer, 12 had colorectal cancer, and one patient each had endometrial carcinoma and primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma. All ovarian cancer patients, three of twelve colorectal cancer patients, and one patient with endometrial carcinoma had received prior therapy. Patients received IL-2 100,000 U/kg every 8 hours intravenously (IV) for 3 days, and 2 days later underwent daily leukapheresis for 5 days. LAK cells were generated in vitro by incubating the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IL-2 for 7 days and were then administered IP daily for 5 days through a Tenckhoff catheter (Davol, Inc, Cranston, RI) together with IL-2 25,000 U/kg IP every 8 hours. All but one patient completed at least one cycle of therapy. Toxic side effects included minor to moderate hypotension, fever, chills, rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, oliguria, fluid retention, thrombocytopenia, and minor elevations of liver function tests; all of these rapidly improved after discontinuation of IL-2. One patient had a grand mal seizure, and one suffered a colonic perforation; these were felt to be treatment-related. IP fibrosis developed in 14 patients and limited repeated cyclic administration of this therapy in five patients. Two of 10 (20%) ovarian cancer patients and five of 12 (42%) colorectal cancer patients had laparoscopy- or laparotomy-documented partial responses. We conclude that LAK cells and rIL-2 can be administered IP to cancer patients, resulting in moderate to severe short-term toxicity and modest therapeutic efficacy. Further investigation of this form of adoptive immunotherapy modified to address the problem of IP fibrosis and with lower IP IL-2 doses is justified by these initial results."

CD009786,0,7879398,0,[Laparoscopic interventions in gynecology].,"Gynecological surgery is performed in a difficult anatomical area of vital organs close to the pelvic wall. It requires precise hemostasis to prevent blood loss and postoperative complications. Both blood loss and complications are reduced by pelviscopic operation techniques. Patients who undergo gynecological pelviscopic operations often experience in comparison to laparotomy less fever, require less postoperative analgesia and are able to tolerate a full diet within 24 hours of surgery. Very often they have a faster recovery and a shorter hospital stay than patients undergoing traditional abdominal or transvaginal operations. The endoscopic operative technique lays the foundation for minimal invasive surgery. The mainly organ-resecting gynecological laparotomy, aiming to avoid recurrence, is increasingly being replaced by pelviscopic organ preservative techniques. Meanwhile we tend to perform many hysterectomies laparoscopically assisted (LAVH). It avoids laparotomy in casesa of adhesions and high uterine tissue mass and seems to lower intraoperative risks such as infection by strong operative restriction of the vaginal approach. CISH (classic intrafascial S*E*M*M* hysterectomy, S*E*M*M denoting ""serrated edge macro-morcellated"") even leaves the pelvic floor intact. Furthermore, we perform pelviscopic operations in cases of endometriosis, benign tumors of the ovaries, ectopic pregnancies and genital malformations (i.e., Vecchietti genitoplasty in the MRK-syndrome)."

Under transvaginal sonographic guidance, a local injection of potassium chloride (0.5 mL = 1.0 mEq) into the embryo was performed for the purpose of embryocide. In Case 1, a follow-up of serum beta-hCG levels showed an initial plateau and subsequent regression to negative, 49 days after the local injection. However, a persistent increase in serum beta-hCG levels was noted in Case 2 for two samples at intervals of two days during follow-up, 27,800 and 36,500 mIU/mL, in spite of the fact that no fetal cardiac activity was visible. Six days later, laparoscopy was done and methotrexate, 50 mg in 6 mL of normal saline, was injected into the ampullar mass of the right fallopian tube in two divided dosages. The serum beta-hCG levels then gradually decreased and returned to negative 60 days after the methotrexate injection. For a viable ectopic pregnancy, this new modality of two-step local injection, first with potassium chloride and then with supplemental methotrexate, separately by two procedures, may offer an additional choice of conservative treatment."

The Roswell Park experience.,"Sixty-four patients with primary fallopian tube cancer treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute from 1964 to 1987 underwent retrospective clinicopathologic review. In 40 patients fallopian tube cancer was the only primary, but in 24 patients primary fallopian tube cancer was part of a multifocal upper genital tract malignancy. Of the 40 patients with unifocal fallopian disease, the median survival was 28 months. Only 15% of patients were alive and disease free with follow-up ranging from 22 to 141 months (median, 90.5 months). Survival was not associated with stage of disease, tumor histology, grade, or depth of invasion in this series. Fourteen patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy were evaluable for response. Three patients (21%) responded; two complete and one partial. Twelve patients without clinical evidence of disease underwent second-look procedures, ten laparotomy and two laparoscopy. Four of ten second-look laparotomies were negative. Secondary debulking was done in three of four patients with gross disease, one of which had a negative third-look laparotomy. Negative laparotomy, second-look or third-look, was associated with improved survival (P = 0.016). One of the two laparoscopies was negative, but the patient recurred. In the remaining 24 patients cancer of the fallopian tube was part of a multifocal upper genital tract malignancy. In 12 patients tubal disease was invasive, and in 12, it was in situ. Separate primaries occurred in the ovaries (n = 20); uterus (n = 7); and cervix (n = 2). This represents 1.3% of ovarian malignancies treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute during the study period. Fallopian tube cancer seems as virulent as ovarian cancer with few long-term survivors. It is frequently associated with other sites of upper genital tract malignancy. Second-look laparotomy is an important predictor of survival. Second-look laparoscopy may be useful if positive."

The aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the functional/nonfunctional rate, the relapse and the malignancy rate. 372 women underwent a diagnostic-operative laparoscopy in the absence of irregular solid and cystic parts detectable by preoperative vaginal ultrasonography. The treatment consisted of non-randomised endosurgical ovarian cystostomy, cystectomy or ovarectomy. Histopathological assessment showed functional ovarian cysts in 268 women and non-functional benign ovarian tumours in 104. 2 cases were subsequently found to be malignant. After a mean follow-up-time of at least one year, we found an overall recurrence rate of 4.6% after cystostomy, 2% after cystectomy and 0% after ovarectomy in the group of functional ovarian cysts and a total of 1% after endosurgical therapy of the non-functional ovarian tumours.

CD009786,0,9557831,0,Laparoscopic management of organic ovarian cysts: is there a place for frozen section diagnosis?,"Only benign ovarian cysts can be treated by laparoscopic surgery. Although clinical examination and the results of pre-operative work-up do make a real contribution in indicating the benign or malignant nature of cysts, only histology can provide the absolute diagnosis. In this context, the goal of this study was to establish whether there is any advantage in performing frozen section during laparoscopic surgical management of organic ovarian cysts. Between January 1989 and March 1996, 228 patients underwent an adnexectomy for an ovarian mass. After the pre-operative work-up and the diagnostic phase of laparoscopy, 26 patients (11.4%) presented with suspected signs of malignancy restricted purely to the ovary. These 26 patients underwent a laparoscopic adnexectomy with extraction of the excised tissues using an endoscopic bag, followed by frozen section. For all these patients the results of the frozen section concluded that the lesion was benign. In every case the definitive histological results confirmed the frozen section findings. This strategy enabled us to avoid laparotomy, especially for the nine post-menopausal patients whose adnexal masses appeared to be complex by ultrasound. These encouraging preliminary results need to be confirmed by a larger series of patients, so as to specify the place of frozen section in the laparoscopic surgical management of organic ovarian cysts."
CD009786,0,22815844,0,"A 46,XY female DSD patient with bilateral gonadoblastoma, a novel SRY missense mutation combined with a WT1 KTS splice-site mutation.","Patients with Disorders of Sex Development (DSD), especially those with gonadal dysgenesis and hypovirilization are at risk of developing malignant type II germ cell tumors/cancer (GCC) (seminoma/dysgerminoma and nonseminoma), with either carcinoma in situ (CIS) or gonadoblastoma (GB) as precursor lesion. In 10-15% of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis cases (i.e., Swyer syndrome), SRY mutations, residing in the HMG (High Mobility Group) domain, are found to affect nuclear transport or binding to and bending of DNA. Frasier syndrome (FS) is characterized by gonadal dysgenesis with a high risk for development of GB as well as chronic renal failure in early adulthood, and is known to arise from a splice site mutation in intron 9 of the Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1). Mutations in SRY as well as WT1 can lead to diminished expression and function of SRY, resulting in sub-optimal SOX9 expression, Sertoli cell formation and subsequent lack of proper testicular development. Embryonic germ cells residing in this unfavourable micro-environment have an increased risk for malignant transformation. Here a unique case of a phenotypically normal female (age 22 years) is reported, presenting with primary amenorrhoea, later diagnosed as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism on the basis of 46,XY gonadal dygenesis with a novel missense mutation in SRY. Functional in vitro studies showed no convincing protein malfunctioning. Laparoscopic examination revealed streak ovaries and a normal, but small, uterus. Pathological examination demonstrated bilateral GB and dysgerminoma, confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Occurrence of a delayed progressive kidney failure (focal segmental glomerular sclerosis) triggered analysis of WT1, revealing a pathogenic splice-site mutation in intron 9. Analysis of the SRY gene in an additional five FS cases did not reveal any mutations. The case presented shows the importance of multi-gene based diagnosis of DSD patients, allowing early diagnosis and treatment, thus preventing putative development of an invasive cancer."

Complete resection is mandatory for malignant lesions, and in the case of benign tumors preservation of healthy ovarian tissue is crucial. Diagnosis is based on clinical features (age and hormonal status), imaging and tumor marker levels. Laparoscopy is of great help in making a diagnosis and staging when the lesion is malignant. Laparotomy by a supra-pubic approach is, however, the only way to ensure a safe treatment of the lesion by avoiding any risk of tumor spillage, which constitutes a chance loss. Surgical treatment consists of complete ovariectomy for a malignant tumor and partial ovariectomy when the lesion is surely benign. Preservation of fertility is based on conservative surgery for uni- or bilateral benign lesions, and may be discussed in some selected cases of bilateral malignant tumors. When the remaining ovarian tissue predicts precocious ovarian failure, ovarian tissue or oocyte cryopreservation may be proposed to patients and their families."

CD009786,0,138476,0,Advances in the staging and treatment of ovarian cancer.,The age adjusted death rate for ovarian cancer has remained unchanged for the past 20 years. Recent data obtained by staging ovarian cancer patients with lymphangiography and peritoneoscopy demonstrated that many patients with apparently localized disease actually have occult dissemination within the abdomen. These new staging techniques plus the determination of the histologic grade of anaplasia may permit a more precise determination of a patient's prognosis and therefore better design of therapeutic stategy. Radiotherapeutic techniques are being adapted to attempt to treat some areas of occult disease. Numerous single chemotherapeutic agents are capable of producing objective tumor responses. Preliminary data suggest that combination chemotherapy can increase the objective response rate above that seen with single agents. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether combination chemotherapy can prolong survival.

From September 4, 1985 through December 1, 1989, 108 patients were operated on in our unit for ovarian tumors suspected of benignity (absence of clinical and ultrasound scanning signs of malignancy). There were 111 operations due to three recurrences. Operative laparoscopy was carried out 100 times. The laparoscopic operations were 71 transparietal cystectomies, 20 intraperitoneal cystectomies, 8 transparietal oophorectomies, and 1 intraperitoneal oophorectomy. Of these, 43 operations were performed in emergency situations and 57 were not. Eight patients were pregnant at the time of laparoscopic treatment, there were no miscarriages. Average operation time and hospital stay duration were 51.80 min and 3.27 days, respectively.

In the last century, the role of prophylactic oophorectomy during benign pelvic operation has been discussed. The choice of this preventive measure raises the question of the advantages and disadvantages that a surgical menopause could cause. Finally, the role of laparoscopy in the performance of the oophorectomy versus the vaginal approach is discussed."

A countrywide survey was undertaken in Austria, comprising questions about ovarian malignancy detected or accidentally treated by laparoscopy. The response rate of 66.7% represented a total of 54,198 laparoscopies, 16,601 laparoscopic surgeries on adnexal masses, and 108 cases of ovarian tumors subsequently found to be malignant (96 well-documented). Twenty patients were treated with laparoscopy alone. In 22 cases, laparoscopy was followed by immediate laparotomy. A delayed laparotomy (3-1415 days) was performed in 54 cases. Staging revealed FIGO classifications from stages Ia to IV. The follow-up time ranges from 2 to 220 months. Four recurrences have been reported. Thirteen patients died of tumor progression. Laparoscopic surgery on ovarian malignancies is a rare situation (0.65% of all endoscopic surgeries on adnexal masses). In cases of malignancy, a laparotomy has to be performed to ensure optimal staging and treatment."

New techniques have changed the way of diagnosing and treating this condition. This study aims to demonstrate the value of laparoscopic surgery for ovarian cysts in the early months of pregnancy. From the 7th November 1985 to the 1st September 1989, eight pregnant women with less than 17 weeks amorrhoea consulted for ovarian tumours that were more than 6 centimeters in diameter. They were all operated on for ovarian tumours of more than 6 centimeters diameter and they were all operated on laparoscopically. Four operations were emergency and four non-emergency. In seven cases cystectomy was carried out transparietally and in one oophorectomy was. Laparoscopic surgery was possible in every case. These was no complication to the pregnancy due to the operation. Laparoscopic surgery permits early treatment of ovarian tumours in pregnancy without the risks of laparotomy. In emergency a quick diagnosis and treatment diminishes the risk of abortion. In non urgent cases a simple technique made it possible to avoid complications of the cyst and to obtain a histological assessment that they were benign."

CD009786,0,10661040,0,Operative laparoscopy in treating benign ovarian cysts.,"This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical usefulness of operative laparoscopy in treatment of benign ovarian cysts. A retrospective study was carried on 468 operative laparoscopy cases performed from September 1995 to September 1998 at Yonsei University College of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Patient characteristics, specimen pathology, perioperative morbidity, and perioperative complications were reviewed. The percentage of operative laparoscopy increased steadily from 20.7% in 1996, 33.9% in 1997, to 49.7% in 1998. The mean age of patients was 33.66.5 (mean +/- SD) years and the mean hospital stay was less than 2 days. Types of surgery performed were cystectomy (n = 234), salpingo-oophorectomy (n = 126), oophorectomy (n = 63), and fulguration (n = 45), in decreasing order. Depending on the pathology of the ovarian cyst, the mean operation time was in the range of 80 to 110 minutes. Perioperative complications included 5 cases of subcutaneous emphysema, 10 cases of abdominal wall hematoma, 7 cases of trocar site bleeding, 3 cases of bowel injury, and 1 case of bladder injury. In conclusion, operative laparoscopy in treating benign ovarian cysts provides advantages such as less need to perform laparotomy, smaller skin incision, less perioperative discomfort, minimal tissue handling and trauma, and shorter hospital stay. Nevertheless, the risk of unrecognized ovarian malignancy cannot be absolutely excluded, therefore careful patient selection is mandated."

CD009786,0,22818540,0,Laparoscopy as the most effective tool for management of postmenopausal complex adnexal masses when expectancy is not advisable.,"Postmenopausal women with adnexal masses suspicious for malignancy must undergo surgery for histopathologic confirmation. The low positive predictive value for malignancy of the currently available preoperative examinations results in 5 to 220 surgeries performed for each case of pelvic malignancy detected, depending on the evaluation method and patient selection. Although extensively reviewed as an effective tool for the investigation and treatment of adnexal masses, laparoscopy is still underused for this purpose in postmenopausal women. Some reasons are uncertainty about the incidental diagnosis of a malignant lesion during laparoscopy, concern about the effect of laparoscopy over the course of a pelvic malignant lesion, and inadequate referral of patients at high risk to specialized centers with oncologic gynecologists. Identification of patients at low risk might also be inadequate, causing them to undergo unnecessary laparotomy. Herein we demonstrate through a comprehensive literature review that laparoscopy is a highly effective tool for investigation and treatment of suspected adnexal masses in postmenopausal women, both in general medical settings without oncologic backup and in specialized centers. The indications for laparoscopy in this context can be further expanded without oncologic harm if patients at low and high risk are appropriately selected for surgery at general and specialized settings, respectively."

Two groups of women were eligible to participate in this investigation: (i) asymptomatic postmenopausal patients or patients >50 years of age, and (ii) asymptomatic women >30 years of age with a family history of ovarian cancer. Ovarian volume was calculated using the prolate ellipsoid formula (length x height x width x 0.523). An abnormal sonogram was defined by (1) an ovarian volume >10 cm3 in postmenopausal women or >20 cm3 in premenopausal women, and (2) a papillary or complex tissue projection into a cystic ovarian tumor. All women with an abnormal TVS had a repeat sonogram in 4-6 weeks. Patients with persistently abnormal scans had a serum CA-125 determination, tumor morphology indexing, and color Doppler sonography. Ninety patients (1.4%) with a persisting abnormality on TVS underwent exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy for tumor removal. Thirty-seven patients had serous cystadenomas and six had primary ovarian cancers. Five patients had Stage IA ovarian cancer and one patient had Stage IIIB disease. Only one of the ovarian cancer patients had a palpable abnormality on pelvic examination, and none had an elevated (>35 u/ml) serum CA-125. All these patients are presently alive and well 1-5 years after conventional therapy. There was one false negative in this study, a 38-year-old white female who was noted to have a small ovarian cancer at the time of laparoscopic prophylactic oophorectomy 11 months after a normal scan. Over 17,000 screening years have been accrued and there have been no deaths from primary ovarian cancer in the screened population. A cost analysis of TVS screening is presented."
CD009786,0,8582588,0,[Laparoscopic preliminary surgery of ovarian malignancies. Experiences from 127 German gynecologic clinics].,"A controversial discussion has arisen between endoscopists and oncologists about laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer and borderline tumours. A questionnaire was mailed to 273 German Departments of Gyn./Obst. A response rate of 46% (127 hospitals) was obtained concerning the endoscopical technique used, the kind and delay of post-endoscopical cancer operation and the early findings (follow-up) in cases of ovarian cancer, dysgerminoma, malignant teratoma, tubal cancer and borderline tumours of the ovary. In this German survey it could be shown that laparoscopic management of malignant ovarian tumours was not uncommon between 1991-1994. Totally, 61% of ovarian cancer stage Ia and 84% of ovarian borderline tumours stage Ia have been reported without any pathological finding in laparotomy subsequent to laparoscopic management of the lesions. The 192 cases cited here are undoubtedly an underestimate of the real present frequency of endoscopically managed ovarian malignancies. Patients with this early ""negative"" report should be followed up carefully and may not permit conclusions that laparoscopic management of ovarian malignancies may be harmless for them. In 16% of the stage Ia borderline tumours and in 39% of the stage Ia ovarian cancer early spread has been found totally, demonstrating that implantations and metastases subsequent to the endoscopical procedure can be found even in an early follow-up phase. In 92.4% laparoscopic capsule rupture, tumour morcellement with intraabdominal spilling, subsequent cystectomy or adnectomy had been the technique of choice with additional rinsing of the intraabdominal cavity. This was harmful for the majority of patients if the subsequent cancer surgery by laparotomy was delayed for more than 8 days. Early progression of these cases to stage I c has been reported in 20% (7/36 cases) and to stage II-III in 53% (19/36 cases). Only in 7.4% the endobag procedure was used in laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer stage Ia. In ovarian cancer stage Ic-III (n = 50) an early seeding in the laparoscopic tract was reported in 52% (13/25) if subsequent cancer surgery by laparotomy was delayed more than 8 days. The endoscopical techniques and the early findings after an endoscopical management are reported in detail. In conclusion, in respect of common oncological standards the actual practice in laparoscopic management of ovarian malignancy is considered poor surgery. Capsule rupture, tumour morcellement and unprotected ""biopsy"" in the intraabdominal cavity and an additional delay of adequate cancer surgery are the main pitfalls of that procedure. For the overwhelming majority of patients undergoing such endoscopical procedures very early implants and metastases in the pelvis, the abdominal cavity or the laparoscopic tract have been found. It seems necessary that laparoscopic management of ovarian malignancies and borderline tumours under the present technical conditions are given up and that we should return to reliable standards of oncological surgery comparable to laparotomy. This should be discussed urgently."

On the other hand, menopausal symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency is an important contributor to the poor quality of life scores in gynecologic cancer survivors. Transposing of the ovaries into the paracolic gutters (ovarian transposition) was described in 1958 with the aim of protecting gonadal functions in reproductive-aged women treated by pelvic radiotherapy and/or surgery. Although the laparatomic approach has been used as a parallel to development in endoscopic surgery, today it is generally performed laparoscopically. However, there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of ovarian tranposition with respect to protecting gonadal functions. Moreover, metastasis to the transposed ovaries and port sites is another concern about this procedure. In this short review, indications, techniques and functional outcomes of ovarian transposition have been summarized."

CD009786,0,4017325,0,Torsion of the adnexa.,"Adnexal torsion is an interesting, uncommon, and potentially lethal condition that may arise most unexpectedly in women of any age, but particularly during the reproductive years. It is generally unilateral and may involve either normal or pathologically enlarged ovary or tube, or both organs. The condition may be partial or complete, the latter often resulting in gangrene and marked exacerbation of symptoms. If untreated, it may progress to necrosis and gangrene, followed by peritonitis, which may be lethal. Prompt diagnosis, in which timely diagnostic laparoscopy and ultrasound evaluation of the pelvis may be helpful, provides the opportunity for prompt laparotomy with untwisting of the torsion and stabilization of the adnexa by suture and cystectomy, if possible, extirpation if not. Organ conservation requires a clear need to preserve reproductive or ovarian function, so cystectomy is generally preferable to oophorectomy."

We describe a case of sudden development of large bilateral endometriomas after a series of negative ultrasound scans, causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Our patient is a 32-year-old nulligravida with long-lasting dysmenorrhea, urinary symptoms, and familiarity for endometriosis, who had voluntarily discontinued oral contraceptives. Various pelvic scans had not shown pathological findings. Five months following the last negative scan, she presented with pain and increase of abdominal girth. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed large ovarian cysts (16 cm right - 10 cm left) and hydronephrosis bilaterally. She underwent conservative surgery followed by GnRH analogs. At a 6-months follow-up, she was symptom-free and ultrasonography showed no recurrence. Endometriosis has still an unknown mechanism of proliferation and its clinical behavior or progression is highly unpredictable. Severe uropathy is commonly related to direct ureteral involvement, but can also depend on an ab-extrinseco compression by large, rapidly growing endometriomas. Women at risk of endometriosis, who are not receiving empirical medical treatment, should be adequately and regularly assessed via pelvic ultrasonography and/or submitted to diagnostic laparoscopy in order to prevent serious consequences such as silent renal loss."

Bedside ultrasonography is a highly accessible tool that can be used in a pregnant woman for screening a mass or ascites. Laparoscopic surgery has now been accepted as a safe modality for definitive diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Because acute ovarian torsion is not encountered frequently, timely diagnosis is required to prevent mortality and minimise morbidity.

This case once again demonstrates possible difficulties in obtaining a correct diagnosis, especially when imaging techniques reach their limits. Here, the anatomical structures had become so altered by adhesions of the omentum that they were no longer identifiable, rendering the advantageous, non-invasive laparoscopy ineffective. As a result, laparotomy became the most accurate and reliable method for obtaining a correct diagnosis.

Patients with high luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (> 12 IU/l) had a better response than patients with lower LH values but a high LH: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio (> or = 2:1). However, the body mass index, ovarian volume or pretreatment testosterone values were not helpful in predicting the clinical outcome. Both responders (n = 22) and non-responders (n = 7) showed a decline in LH and testosterone and an increase in FSH 6-h mean values, following 15-min blood sampling 1 month after surgery, compared to the corresponding pretreatment levels. The magnitude of change was significantly higher for LH (p < 0.01) in responders but there was no difference in the corresponding values of the other hormones between the two groups (p > 0.05).

Diagnosis is based on specific clinicomorphologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features. We report here a variant of DSRCT involving the ovaries that mimics the Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor in a 21-year-old woman complaining of abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a right adnexal mass. She had a slightly raised serum CA-125 level. Frozen section examination identified the right ovarian mass as a poorly differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. The surgically resected tumor and left ovary and omentum implants found during laparoscopy were diagnosed as DSRCT with Leydig cell hyperplasia. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were negative for epithelial markers but were positive for calretinin and inhibin. The patient is still undergoing chemotherapy at 8 months after initial presentation with partial response. This case showed that DSRCT with unusual immunohistochemical profiles and Leydig cells hyperplasia pose a diagnostic challenge. Molecular genetic techniques may help in these cases."

CD009786,0,9880699,0,Laparoscopy for ovarian pathology in infancy and childhood.,"Conventionally, adnexal pathology in pediatric patients is treated by open laparotomy. As laparoscopic procedures are constantly finding wider application in pediatric surgery, the female child presenting with a suspected acute or chronic ovarian lesion may be an ideal candidate for laparoscopic surgery. From June 1994 to June 1996, eight girls aged 4 months to 11 years (mean 6.1 years) underwent laparoscopic procedures for various ovarian pathologies at King Khalid University Hospital (7) and Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar (1). Four children had emergency laparoscopic surgery for lower abdominal crises; three of them were managed successfully for twisted adnexal lesions (2 simple ovarian cysts, 1 benign cystic teratoma), the fourth patient was converted to an open salpingo-oophorectomy. The other four patients had elective laparoscopic excision of adnexal lesions (two antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts and two mature ovarian cystic teratomas). There were no operative complications; the mean operative time was 76.25 min, the mean hospital stay 2.25 days. Our initial experience and technique are presented. It appears that the laparoscopic approach to ovarian lesions in infancy and childhood is an effective and safe method for diagnosis as well as definitive therapy."

CD009786,0,10949380,0,Lymphadenectomy in ovarian cancer.,"Current guidelines for the surgical staging of ovarian cancer include the removal of retroperitoneal lymph nodes (pelvic and aortic). In most centres this is achieved by means of laparotomy, but advanced laparoscopic techniques have also been performed and still further prospective controlled studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to validate the efficacy. Lymph node sampling, short of complete dissection, should be avoided because it may be insufficient to detect metastasis. In any case, laparoscopic lymphadenectomy as well as open surgery, should be in the hands of properly trained subspecialists in gynaecologic oncology. Of 97 patients with ovarian carcinoma studied in our hospital, 68% were treated by means of complete staging laparotomy (FIGO). Lymphadenectomy was spared in 14 cases with stage I tumours (mainly serous) without changes in overall survival. In 15% metastases in pelvic lymph nodes were present. In the same proportion aortic lymph nodes were positive. In 5.5%, aortic metastases were present in the absence of pelvic involvement."

CD009786,0,17991355,0,Innovative laparoscopic surgery in gynecologic oncology.,"Minimally invasive surgery has been performed since the early 1990s, and gynecologic oncology surgeons continue to improve their skills for this procedure. Advanced laparoscopic techniques are used to evaluate and treat cervical, endometrial, and ovarian malignancies. Laparoscopy has significant benefits in selected oncologic patients and may be a more useful technique than the abdominal approach. The benefits of laparoscopy include less postoperative pain, less blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, and a shorter recovery period with no significant increase in complications or morbidity. With emerging data, it appears that the risk of cancer recurrence does not increase with a minimally invasive approach. The incorporation of laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy has expanded the types of procedures performed for the management of certain gynecologic malignancies. New techniques, including hand-assisted laparoscopic procedures and extraperitoneal lymph node dissections, are expanding the role of laparoscopy in the treatment of all gynecologic malignancies."

A thorough investigation for the source of this elevation was negative. Postoperative immunohistochemical staining of the tumor, showed diffuse stain with PLAP, along with gradual decline to normal values of serum total alkaline phosphatase.

We performed an explorative laparoscopy in 15 women presenting with advanced ovarian carcinoma, and for whom the preoperative evaluation was considered unsatisfactory, to define the possibility of achieving a complete cytoreduction. We focused on three sites of carcinomatosis: bowel, liver pedicle, and right diaphragmatic dome. Laparoscopic evaluation was successful in all 15 patients. Four patients were considered to have unresectable carcinomatosis because of extensive involvement of the small bowel and therefore had no laparotomy. These women underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the following 2 weeks. Eleven patients were considered to have resectable peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). Ten women had no macroscopic residual tumor after surgery. A modified posterior exenteration was performed in five patients. The laparoscopic exploration had underestimated the liver pedicle involvement in two patients, but only one had an infracentimetric residual tumor after surgery. Laparoscopy is a reliable method of exploring PC in advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Laparoscopy may obviate the need for unnecessary laparotomy in many cases and may, therefore, contribute to a better quality of life for patients found to have unresectable disease."

The cysts (mean diameter, 4.5 cm; range, 2-7; unilateral, 21 cases; bilateral, 12 cases) were punctured, aspirated, washed and emptied completely. After laparoscopy, 15 subjects received goserelin administered as a 28-day subcutaneous depot for three months, whereas 18 patients undergoing simple observation constituted internal controls. Ultrasound scans were performed before and at one, three and six months after laparoscopy. One case and three controls requested surgery between the four- and five-month follow-up scans and did not complete the study. All the other women had recurrent cysts at the six-month scan. There were no significant differences in mean endometrioma diameter between the two groups at any observation time nor between prelaparoscopic and six-month ultrasound examinations within each treatment group. We conclude that aspiration and washing of endometriotic cysts, combined with postoperative administration of GnRH agonists or not, is ineffective."

A 16-year-old girl presented with abdominal distention, intermittent fever and weight loss. Physical examination and radiologic studies revealed massive ascites, generalized peritoneal thickening and slightly enlarged right ovary with a cystic mass and left pleural effusion. Serum CA 125 was 939 U/L (normal range: 0-35 U/L) and other tumor markers including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) were within normal range. Acid-fast stain and culture were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy were performed with the presumptive diagnosis of peritonitis carcinomatosis, and histologic examination revealed multiple granulomas with epithelioid cells and caseification necrosis which confirmed tuberculosis. Quadruple anti-tuberculosis treatment was administered and the patient's clinical findings and serum CA 125 level returned to normal. In conclusion, tuberculous peritonitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with ascites and elevated serum CA 125. This marker may be useful in monitoring treatment response."

In this patient group the incidence of early or localised stages of ovarial malignomas FIGO I and II is 0.9 per cent. 81 laparoscopies were performed on patients suffering from localised stages of ovarial malignomas. 32% (n = 26) of these laparoscopised patients suffering from ovarial malignomas were subjected to extended diagnostic-surgical laparoscopy. These 26 localised stages of ovarial malignomas on which tumour-aggressive laparoscopy had been performed, were followed up and the relevant literature studied and processed. In 23 of the patients thus subjected to tumour-aggressive laparoscopic surgery we did not observe any deterioration of the prognosis during the treatment period (1-8 years). Problematic postoperative courses were seen in 3 patients; the reasons for this are discussed in the present paper. Measures resulting in opening of the tumours during diagnostic-surgical laparoscopy are neither accidental nor unforeseen incidents, but are rather part of an overall surgical strategy. If safety techniques are adopted-as described in this paper-diagnostic-surgical laparoscopy can be performed even during localised stages of ovarial malignomas without any presently recognisable adverse effect on patient prognosis."

Because of its rarity, there are various approaches to its treatment. We describe a case of malignant struma ovarii, in a 37 year-old female who presented for non cyclic, chronic pelvic pain and the presence of a right ovarian cyst with mean diameter of 7 cm. The patient was treated with laparoscopic right ovariectomy and with multiple biopsies of omental, left ovary and utero-sacral ligament. The patient underwent subsequently total thyroidectomy and radioiodine (131I) ablation. A Medline literature search was performed; we found 48 cases of malignant struma ovarii. The therapeutic management of the disease is very different in the described case; particularly after surgical removing of the ovarian mass, the treatment is still controversial.

The most frequent indications were: sterility (72.2%) and suspicions of adnexal tumours or extrauterine gravidity (14.1%). In 173 diagnostically difficult cases laparotomy was avoided. In these cases laparoscopy allowed to exclude the pelvic pathology or to quality to laparoscopic operation of ovarian cysts and intact tubal pregnancy. Diagnostic and operative laparoscopy give the possibility of quick diagnosis in diagnostically difficult cases and enables avoidance of laparotomy in many cases.
CD009786,0,8147211,0,DNA ploidy of ovarian and adnexal cyst fluid. A useful adjunct to cytology.,"It is increasingly common for cytology laboratories to receive ovarian, adnexal and pelvic cyst fluids obtained via sonographically directed aspiration and laparoscopic techniques, especially from women who are desirous of preserving fertility or who are undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Accurate characterization of such cysts is a worthwhile goal, given the superior prognosis for ovarian carcinomas that are diagnosed at an early stage. In an effort to improve upon the false-negative diagnosis rate associated with cytology, we evaluated DNA ploidy as a possible adjunctive criterion. We examined 55 benign, 3 borderline and 6 malignant aspirates received by our cytopathology laboratory; 35 were aspirated directly from the patient from clinically and ultrasonographically benign cysts, and 29 were aspirated from surgically removed benign (20) and malignant (9) cysts. Adjunctive DNA ploidy and cell cycle analysis was performed using the Cell Analysis Systems CAS-200 on Feulgen-stained cytologic smears of the 64 cyst fluids. Adequate material for DNA analysis was obtained from 33/35 in situ aspirated cysts and from 19/29 surgical specimen cysts. Forty-seven of 52 cytologically benign cysts were diploid. Of the 5 nondiploid benign cysts, 3 were follicle cysts (2 from hormonally stimulated IVF patients and 1 from a postpartum patient), and 1 was a benign cystic teratoma. Their nondiploid DNA pattern or tetraploidy may be due to a high proliferative index. The fifth nondiploid benign aspirate was from a resected benign epithelium-lined cyst; its DNA histogram contained a conspicuous tetraploid population. All 9 malignant cysts were cytologically malignant. Of the 3 borderline cysts, 1 was nondiploid, and 2 were diploid. All 6 fully malignant cysts were nondiploid; 2 of them were tetraploid. Based on our results, we conclude that DNA ploidy analysis of cells derived from ovarian and adnexal cyst aspirates is feasible (in 95% of cases) and relatively specific (90%) and has a relatively high negative predictive value (92%). The results are not sufficiently predictive of the histology of the lesion to warrant therapeutic intervention based on ploidy alone (sensitivity of nondiploid results, 78%; positive predictive value of nondiploid results, 58%). Nondiploidy should suggest consideration, but is not conclusive, of a malignancy diagnosis. There may even be prognostic implications to the ploidy pattern, particularly in borderline tumors, in which nondiploidy portends a poor prognosis."

The observation time ranged between 3 and 7 years. All patients had elevated CA 125 levels at the start of chemotherapy with subsequent normalization during treatment. Seventeen patients were classified as having no evidence of disease during the whole follow-up period. Out of 649 samples analyzed from these patients only 6 of the samples from 4 patients were greater than 35 U/ml (rate of false positives, 0.9%). These high values were all singular; the serum samples for the preceding and following months were normal. Out of 20 verified recurrences in 15 patients, 19 had elevated CA 125 levels (sensitivity, 95.0%). The CA 125 increase was the only sign that initiated clinical investigation in 16 recurrences (sensitivity for early diagnosis, 80.0%). With examination under anesthesia, fine needle aspiration for cytology, CT scan, and sometimes laparoscopy or laparotomy a relapse could be verified in 13 of these cases (sensitivity for the whole procedure, 65.0%). In 2 recurrences the increase in CA 125 was obvious at the same time as the clinical evidence of recurrence and in 1 case the elevation was delayed. One additional patient is presently under investigation because of an increase in CA 125. We conclude that monitoring with monthly determinations of serum CA 125 is a reliable method with very few false-positive values. We regard this as a step forward in the management of the follow-up of ovarian cancer patients."

The mean age of the group was 49.4 (30-80) years, mean weight 72.1 (44.5-114) kg, and mean parity 2.7 (0-8). All patients had preoperative urodynamic study to confirm genuine stress incontinence (GSI). Sixteen patients (14%) had dual pathology (GSI and detrusor instability). A transperitoneal approach was used in 93 operations and extraperitoneal in 20. The mean operating time was 108 (30-320) minutes and mean hospitalization 3.3 (1-10) days. In 13 women the operation was converted to laparotomy; 10 due to adhesions and diminished bladder mobility, 1 for inferior epigastric vessel injury, 1 for an ovarian tumour discovered incidentally at the procedure and 1 for equipment problems. Operative complications included 10 cystotomies (5 repaired laparoscopically), 2 extraperitoneal cases converted to transperitoneal, 1 inferior epigastric vessel injury, 1 vaginal tear, 1 suture through the bladder and 1 case of possible enterotomy oversewn at laparoscopy.

CD009786,0,11917373,0,"[Doppler ultrasonography in the diagnosis of ovarian cysts: indications, pertinence and diagnostic criteria].","To discriminate ovarian lesions is of particular importance in gynecological practice. Two main problems need answers: discrimination of benign and malignant adnexal masses and choice of the appropriate surgical treatment if necessary. Nearly 2% of the adnexal masses are ovarian carcinomas or border line tumors. It is now well established that ultrasonography is the gold standard for ovarian cyst diagnosis. The purpose of this work was to review the literature and to establish, with the evidence based medicine model, which parameters and existing diagnostic models using ultrasound and Doppler performs best in the evaluation of adnexal masses. Transvaginal sonography has demonstrated considerable advantage over conventional transabdominal sonography. However, transparietal sonography is still useful in large tumors. It is no longer reasonable to subject all patients undergoing pelvic sonography to bladder distension. Functional ovarian cyst characterization seems easy using sonography and Doppler. In case of complication, discrimination of such functional cyst may be difficult but spontaneous regression confirms usually the expectative management. Dermoid cysts and endometriomas seem to be easier to discriminate from other adnexal masses. Papillary formations on the inside of the cyst wall and masses with a non hyperechoic solid component are the most statistically significant predictors of a malignant ovarian mass. Ultrasound and morphologic parameters have a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 93%, that make this exam the gold standard for ovarian masses diagnosis. Another parameter is important: experienced hands with subjective evaluation seems to be one of the best ultrasound method for adnexal masses discrimination. Scoring system help differentiate benign from malignant masses (sensitivity 90%, VPP 50%). Doppler flow measurement and assessment of tumor vascularity by doppler energy increase the confidence with which a correct diagnosis is made. Moreover, combined US techniques and a diagnostic algorithm perform significantly better than morphologic assessment, color doppler or CA125 measurement alone. Logistic regression and neural network models are good methods and may be useful for malignancy prediction but the improvement is small and the concordance with histology far from 100%. In front of a benign and maybe functional cyst, spontaneous resolution may be controlled by sonographic exam at 3 and 6 months. Three-dimensional ultrasound and power doppler, contrast enhanced sonography, and sonography during the laparoscopic procedure are not still validated. Every suspicious ovarian mass needs sonography by an expert which can first use all the techniques and the different parameters to discriminate benign and malignant tumors. Secondly, after control if necessary, he can propose the patient for appropriate surgical treatment."

CD009786,0,7982547,0,[Diagnosis and therapy of adnexal tumors in postmenopause. A prospective study].,"The management of postmenopausal adnexal tumours is still controversially discussed. Approximately 30% of all postmenopausal tumours are malignant. The standard operative approach for these adnexal masses is still the exploratory laparotomy although the advantages of laparoscopic procedure are obvious, even in older patients. The aim of this prospective study was to find out to what extent diagnostic-operative laparoscopy is able to replace laparotomy in the therapy of postmenopausal adnexal masses. From January 1990 to August 1992, 169 postmenopausal patients entered the prospective study. After careful preoperative diagnostics, 63 patients underwent a laparotomy (group B) and 106 patients a laparoscopy (group A). 10 of these 106 cases underwent laparotomy after diagnostic laparoscopy (group Ab). The main operative procedure in group Aa was laparoscopic adnexectomy after Semm. Mean operative time and mean postoperative hospital stay were significantly lower in patients, who only underwent laparoscopic operation (group Aa). One case (0.9%) of the laparoscopically operated patients was subsequently found to be malignant (histologic assessment) and immediately treated by laparotomy with hysterectomy and contralateral adnexectomy. The combination of vaginal examination, vaginal/abdominal ultrasonography (tumor marker CA 125) and a sufficient preoperative diagnostic during endosurgery (no proliferations on the ovary or peritoneal surface, no ascites) reduces the risk of operating a malignant tumour by laparoscopy to a minimum. We believe that operative laparoscopy of postmenopausal adnexal masses is a safe and efficient method in carefully selected women."
CD009786,0,11917377,0,[Ovarian cyst: surgical indications and access].,"Laparoscopic treatment of adnexal masses is indicated when all criteria of a benign lesion are present: transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates a mass < 5 cm, with liquid or dermoid content, with less than 3 fine partitions (< 3 mm), a thin wall (< 3 mm), no vegetations, normal Doppler. Laparoscopy is also indicated for ""benign"" cysts measuring 5 to 10 cm if laparoscopy is feasible. Peroperative exploration is the rule. Since the benign or malignant nature of an ovarian mass cannot be determined macroscopically, precaution must be taken to avoid potential laparoscopic dissemination: use of an extraction pouch, instrument cleaning, cytotoxic agent (chlorexidine or povidone-iodine) for trocar tracts, prevention of gas leakage, 3-plane suture of trocar orifices measuring > 10 mm, short interval between laparoscopic diagnosis of cancer and onset of chemotherapy or complete surgery (1 week). In case of pre- or peroperatively suspected malignancy, cytology examination of the peritoneal fluid and careful peroperative exploration of the abdomen and pelvis with peritoneal biopsy as needed are required. Simple cystectomy or adnexectomy may be performed, depending on the age of the patient, while waiting for the final pathology report. Peroperative intraperitoneal rupture must be avoided, converting to laparotomy if needed. If several suspicious elements are found, median laparotomy is often recommended, particularly in case of suspected cancer with extra-ovarian involvement, or if there is a risk of peroperative rupture. Peroperative pathology of the adnexectomy specimen and peroperative exploration will depend on the operator's experience and the availability of pathology examination in the operating room. First line laparoscopy allows an analysis of the operability and choice of the most appropriate access."

The laparoscopic approach in the field of urology was initially limited to the identification of the undescended testes in paediatric urology and to the laparoscopic ligation of varicocele. More recently, it took into account the pelvic lymphadenectomy for staging prostatic and bladder cancer. The upper urinary tract and the retroperitoneum were approached more recently. In a preliminary phase the indications for laparoscopic nephrectomy were limited to benign diseases, such as atrophic kidney in patients with renal hypertension, and scarred pyelonephritic kidney. At present some preliminary experiences are reported about nephrectomy performed for carcinoma of the urether or of the upper collecting system and for renal masses of unknown origin. Another indication for a laparoscopic approach to the kidney is represented by symptomatic renal cysts. These cysts have been usually treated with percutaneous aspiration and/or sclerosis, but a high rate of recurrence is reported. Laparoscopy may be used to approach renal cysts with the advantage that most of the cystic wall could be excised, reducing the change of recurrence. Another possible indication for laparoscopy and laparoscopic sonography is the retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in testes cancer with staging or therapeutic purposes.

In this study we identified the most important independent clinical and pathological prognostic factors in stage I epithelial invasive ovarian carcinoma in a large data base of 1545 patients with stage I epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The patients were treated in 6 different countries but were analysed in the same way. Because of the increasing use of endoscopy to remove possibly malignant cysts and the reports on rapid spread of ovarian carcinoma in the peritoneal cavity after laparoscopic removal of ovarian cancers, special attention was made to the presence and timing of the cysts before or during surgery. The multivariate analyses identified degree of differentiation as the most powerful prognostic indicator of disease-free survival, followed by rupture before surgery, rupture during surgery, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 1973 stage and age. When the effects of these factors were accounted for, none of the following were of prognostic value for disease-free survival: histological type, dense adhesions, extracapsular growth, ascites, FIGO stage 1988, and size of tumour. In conclusion, degree of differentiation was the most powerful prognostic indicator in Stage I ovarian cancer and should be used when deciding therapy in clinical practice. We also strongly advocate the inclusion of degree of differentiation in a new FIGO classification of stage I ovarian carcinoma. In addition, rupture before and during surgery, FIGO Stage 1973 (Ib versus Ia) and age were shown to be independent prognostic factors.

CD009786,0,19524715,0,Seven-liter ovarian cyst in an adolescent treated by minimal access surgery: laparoscopy and open cystectomy.,"Laparoscopic approaches to giant ovarian cysts, particularly in adolescents, have critical management concerns as follows: risk of malignancy, risk of cyst rupture, and limited working space. A 15-year-old girl presented with a giant (>25 cm) ovarian serous cyst adenoma containing 7 L of fluid. At open laparoscopy, a giant, entirely cystic, smooth mass originating from the right ovary and lying between the symphysis and the xiphoid was observed. After intraabdominal fluid aspiration, open conservative cystectomy was performed, avoiding spillage. The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged on the second postoperative day. To our knowledge, this is the largest ovarian cyst treated conservatively in an adolescent. Minimal access surgery, laparoscopy and open cystectomy, can be safely proposed in this group of patients. Conservative surgery should always be evaluated for preservation of ovarian function in cases of giant ovarian cysts in adolescents."

When a large mass persists or enlarges, surgical evaluation is mandated, preferably in the second trimester. To prevent the morbidity of a laparotomy and minimize length of stay, operative laparoscopy was performed on two pregnant women, gestational ages 18 and 15 weeks, with large ovarian tumors ranging in size from 10 to 18 cm. Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy was successful in both patients, and frozen section confirmed the benign nature of the tumors.

CD009786,0,18433977,0,The role of laparoscopy in the treatment of early ovarian carcinoma.,"Laparoscopic management of early ovarian cancer (EOC) has constituted a controversial issue since it was first described. Recent data reinforced the arguments supporting the use of laparoscopy in the management of EOC. Advances in laparoscopy have enabled surgeons to meet the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics' criteria for staging of EOC. Although most study results are encouraging, the sample size is still too small to be able to draw definite conclusions. Frequently cited concerns such as accuracy of staging, intraabdominal tumor rupture and port site metastasis should not be used as arguments against laparoscopic management of EOC. Clinical evidence is clearly in favor of a larger role for laparoscopy in the management of EOC. This should encourage studies with larger sample sizes to confirm the validity of laparoscopic management of EOC."

Patients with endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy and confirmed by laparoscopic biopsy prior to hormonal treatment received danazol, 800 mg daily. The tissue samples were obtained after 2, 4, and 6 months of usage of the drug to study the ultrastructural effect of this treatment. The glandular epithelium appeared to be arrested in what looked like the late proliferative stage of the normal menstrual cycle. The ciliated cells remained unchanged for the most part. The findings were correlated with possible effects of danazol on the target tissue, but caution is required in the interpretation of ultrastructural effects of steroids until detailed knowledge of the metabolic pathways is available."
CD009786,0,17578369,0,Ectopic ovary: a case of autoamputated ovary with mature cystic teratoma into the cul-de-sac.,"An ovary with a mature cystic teratoma which was autoamputated into the cul-de-sac and confirmed by laparoscopy is described. A 24-year-old woman with a history of chronic pelvic pain for 5 years presented with left abdominal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left ovarian mass of 5 cm in diameter. The pain was relieved spontaneously after a few weeks. Laparoscopy was performed 5 months later. The mass was identified in the cul-de-sac partly enveloped in the omentum without any ligamentous or direct connection with the pelvic organs. There was no left ovary in its proper anatomical location. Histopathologic study revealed a mature cystic teratoma with viable ovarian tissue. These findings suggested autoamputation of the ovary either by inflammation or torsion, which is one of the mechanisms for the formation of an ectopic ovary."
CD009786,0,9050641,0,Laparoscopic techniques for extracting ovarian teratomas.,"We performed two techniques for laparoscopic extraction of benign ovarian teratomas. For cysts up to 5 cm, we used the pouch technique, with partial extraction followed by enlargement of the hypogastric port. A skin incision was enlarged to allow the use of a scalpel in the pouch. This enabled us to perform several stab incisions in the cyst to spill its contents while still holding it in the pouch. This was followed by suction irrigation and forceps removal of the contents until the collapsed cyst could be removed in the pouch. For a cyst over 5 cm, we performed endoscopic aspiration irrigation with hot water inside the cyst, followed by partial extraction of the cyst; an opening was made in the exposed cyst wall and the contents extracted as described. When the cyst wall collapsed, we proceeded with the final extraction. When spillage occurred, it was managed with extensive warm lavage of the peritoneum, skimming the floating debris with suction tubing until clear, and underwater inspection and removal of teeth and other solid material. With these techniques, we experienced no complications."

CD009786,0,15717442,0,Diagnosis and management of organic ovarian cysts: indications and procedures for laparoscopy.,"In the field of gynaecological surgery, the past few years have been significant due to the development of operative laparoscopy. Originally recommended for the diagnosis of female infertility, over the past 15 years laparoscopy has acquired the standing of a surgical discipline in its own right. Laparoscopic surgical treatment of ovarian cysts, whether conservative or radical, has now been completely standardized. The aim of this work is to specify the indications, procedures and risks involved with this surgery as applied to organic ovarian cysts. Only benign ovarian cysts are suitable for treatment by laparoscopic surgery; ovarian cancer must always be handled by classic surgery using a mid-line laparotomy. Given that clinical and other pre-operative investigations can give only an indication, ovarian lesions require surgical investigation to diagnose the histological type. Laparoscopy appears to be as reliable as laparotomy when assessing whether an ovarian tumour is malignant. The risk of parietal contamination and peritoneal dissemination if a malignancy is not recognized means that, if there are no signs of extra-ovarian extension, adnexectomy is mandatory whenever there is the slightest doubt. This adnexectomy must obey two important rules: it must be accomplished without rupturing the cyst, and the cyst must be placed, intact, inside an endoscopic bag before being extracted. Provided that all stages of the procedure, from pre-operative work-up to the initial diagnostic phase of the laparoscopy, are carried out meticulously, laparoscopic surgery is reliable for both the diagnosis and the management of benign organic-ovarian cysts."
CD009786,0,12013106,0,Peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking ovarian carcinoma with ascites and elevated serum CA-125: case report and review of literature.,"Peritoneal tuberculosis is rare in the western world, although its incidence has been increasing in recent years. The presenting signs and symptoms, imaging examinations and CA-125 status in peritoneal tuberculosis may resemble that of ovarian carcinoma. Thus, the possibility of peritoneal tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma, especially in women immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. A case of peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking ovarian carcinoma in a young woman immigrant from India is described. The patient presented with ascites, abdominopelvic masses and elevated serum CA-125 (1,081 U/ml). Laparoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis and no malignancy, and thereby unnecessary extended surgery was avoided. Following treatment with the 4-drug anti-tuberculosis regimen, the patient recovered with disappearance of ascites and abdominopelvic masses, and return of CA-125 to normal range. It is concluded that laparoscopy, if feasible, seems to be a sufficient and safe method to provide diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis."
CD009786,0,15717440,0,Modern surgical approaches to female reproductive tract.,"Laparoscopic and hysteroscopic surgery have changed the management of many gynaecological disorders. Procedures that previously required a long duration of hospitalization can now be done on an outpatient basis or with a short hospital stay. Surgical treatment remains the definitive and universal treatment of ectopic pregnancy and it can be safely done by laparoscopy. Most reproductive operations are done by laparoscopy and the results appear to be similar to those obtained with laparotomy. Those needing a laparotomy will be better treated by in-vitro fertilization. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is a viable alternative for infertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Most ovarian cysts and endometriosis should be treated by laparoscopy. Although uterine myomas can be removed by laparoscopy, the uterine integrity after the procedure is questionable. Surgery should be reserved for women who have completed their family or those with pedunculated or shallow intramural myomas. Alternatively, a laparoscopically assisted myomectomy can be done. For laparoscopic hysterectomies for benign lesions, supracervical hysterectomy appears to be a good option. Hysteroscopy has changed our management, particularly for abnormal uterine bleeding. A submucous myoma and polyp can be removed by hysteroscopy and, as an alternative to hysterectomy, endometrial ablation can be done. In the future, most procedures will be done by endoscopy and laparotomy will be reserved only for selected cases."

The actual treatment regimen consists of a cytoreductive surgery followed by a combination chemotherapy. Few studies have compared outcome of EPSPC to papillary serous ovarian cancer (PSOC). Several authors have documented similar clinical behavior between EPSPC and PSOC, but this finding has not been universal. A 64-year-old female patient with symptomatic gall stone disease underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Unexpectedly we found some uncommon small nodular structures on the serosa of the right colon. The histological findings suggested a poorly differentiated peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma. Biopsies of both ovaries showed no signs of tumor infiltration and the diagnosis of EPSPC was established. After surgery, a combination chemotherapeutic regimen with carboplatin and cyclophosphamid was given. Laparoscopic reassessment 7 months after the first procedure showed no tumor. 3 identical cycles completed chemotherapy. Normal ovaries and no other tumor sites were found in a final laparoscopic look after 11 months."

Laparotomy is generally performed, even though this approach is regarded as highly invasive, whereas laparoscopy, though minimally invasive, is relatively contraindicated because of the high conversion rates to laparotomy. In light of this, we propose laparoscopically guided transverse minilaparotomy (LGTM) as a minimally invasive alternative technique. The rationale of diagnostic laparoscopy is to evaluate the feasibility of a minimally invasive approach. We have evaluated the feasibility and compared the outcomes with a historical group treated with laparotomy (LPTM), in morbidly obese patients (MOP) subjected to gynaecologic surgery."

A 47-year-old-female who had undergone laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy for sigmoid cancer with multiple metastatic liver tumors, was treated with 3 courses of FOLFOX4 and 9 courses of FOLFIRI. Bevacizumab (BV) was started to administer with FOLFIRI since a CT scan had revealed that metastatic liver tumors had enlarged . Four days after final administration of BV (13th course), she presented lower abdominal pain. CT scan showed an enlarged right ovary sized 20 cm, but no findings suggesting bowel perforation; therefore we assumed her pain was due to enlarged ovarian tumor, which might be metastasis from sigmoid cancer. Increased oral morphine could not relieve her pain. Then, along with sufficient information about the risks of the operation caused by BV, we proposed an operation to remove her enlarged ovary. Day 16 after final administration of BV, we undertook a laparotomy by lower median incision, and found a twisted right adnex with large necrotic ovarian tumor. Pathologists diagnosed the ovarian tumor as primary ovarian cancer. No complication related to BV occurred, and she was moved to the ward for internal medicine 13 days after operation."

Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with implant resection was performed. Histologic findings were consistent with a serous borderline tumors of both ovaries and the peritoneal implant was of the non-invasive type. There is no evidence of recurrence at 3-year follow-up.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 127 operative ovarian lesions including 30 ovarian torsions (23.6%) treated in two pediatric centers over a 10-year period. Age at presentation, presenting symptoms, diagnostic studies, surgical procedure and pathological findings were analyzed. Mean age was 13.7 years. Conservative surgery has been performed in 46.7% of the cases and laparoscopic approach in 40%. Ovarian torsion occurred in 56.7% on ovaries with functional lesion, in 23.3% on normal adnexa and in 20% on ovaries with benign neoplasm. The article includes a literature review (2000-2010) and a statistical analysis which shows a slow increase in conservative surgery from 28 to 45%. Laparoscopic surgery accounts for 23.5%. Literature review shows 40.5% normal adnexa, 33.2% non-neoplastic lesions, 25.3% benign neoplasms and 1% malignant neoplasms. The surgical treatment of children and adolescents presenting adnexal torsion should be practiced as an emergency and it should be more conservative as possible in order to maximize the future reproductive potential."

We also examined 56 cases of postoperative ovarian cancer by ultrasonography to detect recurrent lesions. Positive predictive values for serous cysts and endometrial cysts were higher with TV than TA. Sensitivity for cancer was also high, but false negative rate was lower with TV than TA. The results showed that scatter from small particles and small mural echo in the cystic mass are visualized more clearly with TV, so that TV is more useful for assessing histological type of ovarian tumors. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonographic examination for detecting intraperitoneal recurrent lesions were 88.2% and 97.4%, respectively. Those for extraperitoneal lesions were 86.7% and 97.6%.

Her condition deteriorated as she developed a fever and worsening hallucinations. Brain imaging was normal but a lumbar puncture revealed a reactive cerebrospinal fluid. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a left ovarian mass suggestive of a teratoma. A diagnosis of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) limbic encephalitis was made but the anti-NMDAR antibody was found to be negative. The patient proceeded to a laparoscopic oopherectomy and a 5-day course of plasma exchange. The patient has made a gradual improvement and the anti-NMDAR antibody has since become positive.

They received escalating doses of intraperitoneally (IP) administered yttrium-90 (Y-90)-labeled monoclonal antibody, HMFG1, against a tumor cell-surface antigen. Myelosuppression prevented an escalation of the administered Y-90 activity above 25 mCi. Y-90-labeled antibody was absorbed from the peritoneal cavity into the circulation. Maximum blood Y-90 activity was observed 40 hours after the IP injection with a mean of 21% of the injected activity (range, 14.2% to 26.4%) in the circulation. The radiation dose the bone marrow received from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody (the blood radiation dose) was calculated by applying the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) formulation to the measured Y-90 activity in patients blood. Myelosuppression occurred following calculated blood radiation doses to bone marrow of only 10 to 30 cGy. The excessive myelosuppression following such modest radiation doses from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody could be explained by the uptake of Y-90 by bone. In an attempt to reduce bone absorption of Y-90, seven patients received an intravenous (IV) infusion of EDTA (Sinclair Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Godalming, United Kingdom). This increased the urinary excretion of Y-90 from a mean of 11.1% to 32.3% of the injected activity (P = .0001). Fourteen patients had assessable tumor at laparoscopy. Tumor regression was observed in one patient, and palliation of ascites in a further patient."
CD009786,0,18950959,0,"""Exterritorial"" lymphocytic hypophysitis within an ovarian teratoma during pregnancy: a possible sentinel lesion?","Pituitary tissue is rarely to be found among the constituents of ovarian teratomas (dermoid cysts). In some exceptional cases, however, such ectopic pituitary anlagen may even give rise to secondary organ-specific pathologies. Akin to those of the pituitary in its natural location, these tend to be adenomas. We describe a unique example of lymphocytic hypophysitis incidentally encountered in a mature left ovarian teratoma from a 30-year-old woman in the 19th week of pregnancy. Amidst various fully differentiated derivatives of all three embryonic layers, the cyst wall also included a miniature replica of the anterior pituitary lobe 0.5 cm in diameter. While a full set of adenohypophyseal hormone-producing cell types could be identified, there was characteristic pregnancy-related hyperplasia of lactotrophs. This was further overlaid by prominent mononuclear inflammation, including infiltration by T lymphocytes, follicular aggregates of B cells, and attendant destruction of parenchyma. There was no significant inflammatory reaction elsewhere. Discounting the non-standard location, the ensemble of the clinical setting and histology were felt to be indistinguishable from the classical paradigm of lymphocytic hypophysitis complicating pregnancy. To date, lymphocytic thyroiditis is the sole form of organ-specific inflammatory process within an ovarian teratoma on record. By analogy, we hypothesize that this ectopic manifestation of immune-mediated inflammation of pituitary parenchyma may possibly be read as a preclinical sentinel lesion of lymphocytic hypophysitis."

Blood kinetics and urinary excretion of the radiolabels were assayed. Scintigraphy was performed immediately following administration and before and after peritoneal lavage at 48 h. Blood levels of both preparations rose over the first 20-40 h reaching 8-14% of the administered dose in the circulation and then declined (T1/2 of 40 h). Circulating radiolabel was still attached partially to antibody as shown by precipitation with anti-mouse IgG antiserum. The rapid appearance of radiolabel in the bloodstream meant that any tumour localization could be from circulating antibody rather than local infiltration. Interpretation of the images was difficult and the distribution of the tracer was different from that previously observed using i.v. administration of antibody. In some cases the images were confusing and the uptake of activity did not fit in with the clinical knowledge of the disease or the findings from laparoscopy.

Fluorescence photodetection is based on the application of a photosensitizer relatively selective for malignant tissue, which after light activation of appropriate wavelength, shows fluorescence. Six hours after oral application of 10 mg/kg body weight 5-aminolevulinic acid, the abdominal cavity of a patient with suspicion of recurrent ovarian cancer was inspected using a laparoscope and blue light at 380-440 nm. Spectral measurements at a wavelength of 635 nm, multiple peritoneal biopsies, and lymph node excisions were performed. White light inspection and porphyrin fluorescence photodetection revealed no intraperitoneal metastases and multiple biopsies were negative. Fluorescence-positive lymph nodes were visible only in the left common iliac region and a specific porphyrin fluorescence peak could be detected. In contrary, no increased porphyrin fluorescence of intraperitoneal tissues or skin was seen. Fluorescence microscopy showed the characteristic red fluorescence in the infiltrated parts of the lymph node tissue by the papillary ovarian cancer. Histology of the other sites was negative. No systemic or cutaneous side effects were recorded.

It is not possible to isolate sonographically the anatomically unchanged tube or the tube obliterated as a result of salpingitis. Nevertheless, it is possible to effect an indirect diagnosis if the tube is at least unilaterally patent or if it is bilaterally occluded, by means of an extended form of sonography within the scope of a sonographically controlled hydropertubation via a phenomenon which the author describes an ""positive"" or ""negative"" ""phenomenon of Douglas"". Hence, sonographically monitored hydropertubation, together with hysterosalpingography or laparoscopic chromopertubation--with reservations--is a valuable diagnostic tool to help in clarifying the cause of sterility. Pathological changes of the tubes in the sense of a sactosalpinx of different contents (retained secretions) can be differentiated by sonography. A characteristic sonographic echo pattern is also seen if the tubes are conglutinated with an extremely low amount of liquid collected in the tube.

The 3 tubal sterilization procedures were completed in 18 to 30 minutes, with negligible blood loss. Operative time for the 3 salpingectomies because of ectopic pregnancy was 62 to 116 minutes. One of these procedures included management of 2000 mL hemoperitoneum. Three of the 4 attempts at ovarian enucleation were successfully completed within 64 to 162 minutes, with estimated blood loss ≤ 50 mL. One NOTES procedure failed because of a misdiagnosed peritoneal mucinous tumor located anterior to the uterus and inaccessible, leading to subsequent conversion to transabdominal laparoscopy. Our preliminary results show that purely transvaginal NOTES is feasible and safe for use in performing uterine adnexal procedures in selected patients. However, the procedure cannot be used in patients with cul-de-sac disease, and could have limited use in treating lesions located anterior to the uterus."
CD009786,0,12214460,0,[Latest information in the diagnoses of ovarian carcinoma].,"Despite improvements in median and overall survival from a combination of improved operation techniques and chemotherapy with platinum-compounds and paclitaxel, long-term survival rates for patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma remain disappointing, and ongoing efforts are aimed at developing more effective primary therapies. In early ovarian carcinoma, conservative management is used to denote surgery that preserves reproductive potential without compromising curability. With some exceptions, such a strategy may be applicable for women younger than 40, who wish to bear children. A major dilemma facing gynecologic oncologists is to determine whether the accurate staging laparotomy is needed for apparent low-risk stage I ovarian carcinoma and how many cycles of chemotherapy will be needed for high-risk stage I ovarian carcinoma. In advanced ovarian carcinoma, main objectives of salvage therapy include: a improvement in quality of life and symptoms; b. tumor load reduction and survival advantage; c. evaluation of potentially active new drugs to be included in first-line treatment. We need to evaluate the potential benefit on survival of systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy during primary or secondary cytoreductive surgery in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma. Paclitaxel/cisplatin is considered to be the international standard treatment based on the data of GOG 111 trial showing that paclitaxel/cisplatin has provided a survival benefit better than that of cyclophosphamide/cisplatin. This choice of standard therapy might, however, be questioned based on the results of the largest randomised study, ICON3. There were no statistically significant differences in progression-free or overall survival among paclitaxel/carboplatin and carboplatin only or a platinum combination (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/cisplatin).

CD009786,0,19919915,0,[Advanced ovarian cancer: criteria of resectability].,"Residual disease is the first predictive factor for survival in women with ovarian cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy still has not proved superiority in terms of overall survival compared with complete initial resection. Hence, initial surgery remains the cornerstone of management for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Various parameters have been proposed to evaluate the ability of complete resection. Clinical evaluation of peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascite is not relevant enough while general status (ASA score) is correlated with the risk of postoperative complications. Preoperative dosage of CA-125 higher than 500 UI/L seems to be related with an increase risk of sub-optimal surgery. Recently, some authors challenged its prognostic value. For a CA-125 threshold at 500 UI/L, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values range from 58 to 78%, 64 to 89%, 64 to 84% and 35.7 to 85.4%, respectively. Imaging criteria failed to report concordant results. Indeed, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values vary from 52 to 100%, 75 to 100%, 49% to 100% and 50 to 100%, respectively. High-correlation has been demonstrated for carcinomatosis scores evaluating the dissemination of the disease (AUCs of ROCs curves higher than 0.6). At laparotomy, for an Eisenkop score under 6, 99% of patients could benefit of complete resection. At laparoscopy, for a Fagotti score under 4, a complete cytoreduction could be obtained in 78% of patients. This score had the best AUC (0.76). Various scoring systems are available for surgeons to evaluate the resecability of advanced ovarian cancer. Among them, peroperative scoring systems appear the best tool and should be recommended in routine especially at first laparoscopy. Finally, due to the impact on survival of complete initial resection, women with advanced ovarian cancer should be referred to specialized centres."
CD009786,0,11834867,0,Influence of pelvic endometriosis and ovarian endometrioma on fertility.,"We investigated the influence of pelvic endometriosis and ovarian endometrioma on pregnancy outcome in women associated with infertility. A total of 237 women with endometriosis were reviewed, and their fertility rate was assessed by both r-AFS staging and TOP classification as previously proposed by our group. There was no significant difference in pregnancy rate among r-AFS stages. However, the pregnancy rate was mostly affected by the tubal condition according to the TOP classification as follows: no adhesive lesion (T0), 53% (69/129); unilateral lesion (T1), 46% (18/39); bilateral lesion with at least one tube patent, (T2), 37% (10/27); bilateral tubal occlusion (T3), 0% (0/8) (p < 0.05, Mantel-Extension test). The absence (O0-O1) or co-existence (O2-O3) of ovarian endometrioma and different gradings of cul-de-sac obliteration (P2-P3) showed no significant differences in pregnancy rate. The resulting conception rate was also not affected by the size or location of ovarian endometrioma. In addition, the higher adhesion score of ovarian endometrioma involving the fallopian tube and as described in r-AFS classification had a significant detrimental effect on fertility. These observations suggest that our TOP classification describing individual tubal condition has a clinically predictive value in assessing the reproductive outcome of women with endometriosis."

CD009786,0,18802903,0,Dermoid tumors of the ovary: evaluation of the gasless lift-laparoscopic approach.,"Laparoscopic removal is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for dermoid tumors. However, the spillage of dermoid content with the laparoscopic approach is very high compared to laparotomy. The potential malignancy of dermoid tumors and the rare, but difficult to treat, chemical peritonitis in cases of spillage of dermoid content should lead to an adaptation of procedures during an endoscopic operation on a dermoid tumor to comply with the precautions of the ""open"" technique. Lift-laparoscopy combines laparoscopy with the standard procedures of laparotomy and thus may help reduce the spillage of dermoid contents. In a retrospective study of 108 patients with dermoid tumors, the frequency of the rupture of a dermoid tumor during a lift-laparoscopic operation was examined. Among the 79 cases of organ-preserving treatment, there were only three cases (3.8%) where a rupture of the dermoid capsule occurred. Even in cases of ruptures, it was possible to avoid spillage by closing the lesion with a clamp and continue the enucleation of the dermoid tumor during a lift-laparascopic operation. After thorough abdominal cavity lavage, none of these three cases showed a cytological contamination of the abdominal cavity with dermoid cells. None of the ovariectomy or adnexectomy cases showed a rupture. Histologically, there was also no carcinoma in any of the examined dermoid tumors. By adapting the endoscopic dermoid surgery to the precautions established in an open surgery technique using gasless lift-laparoscopy, ruptures and cell spilling can be avoided to a large extent but not completely excluded. Compared with other methods, the number of ruptures and spillage of dermoids by organ-preserving treatment as well as ovariectomy is lowest using a lift-laparoscopic procedure."

CD009786,0,8059620,0,Ovarian cysts: a clinical dilemma.,"The rapid development of ultrasound technology and its routine application during gynecological examinations has led to the more frequent detection of ovarian cysts. Such cysts can be diagnosed at any age or stage of a woman's life, and detected as early as the fetal stage or as late as the postmenopause. Ovarian cysts in female fetuses are usually detected during screening in pregnancy and followed after delivery as neonates. A few months are usually sufficient for spontaneous regression, although symptomatic cysts should be promptly operated. In fertile women, most cases present benign functional cysts which disappear after menstruation or can be managed easily with the combined oral contraceptive pill. When pregnancy is complicated with an adnexal mass, the second trimester is the preferable time of action in cases when operation is demanded. Transvaginal sonography plays an important role, not only in the detection of ovarian cysts but also in the diagnosis of malignancy. Large cysts, multiloculi, septa, papillae and increased blood flow are all suspected signs of neoplasia. The incidence of ovarian cancer increases with age and is predominantly a disease of peri- and postmenopausal women with an average patient age of 50-59 years. Vaginal sonography has been established as the examination of choice in screening and follow-up of patients, with complementary color Doppler studies and determination of serial serum levels of CA-125. If a malignant cyst is suspected, at any age, explorative laparotomy should be performed promptly. Sonographic or computerized tomographic scanner aspiration procedures, as well as laparoscopic surgery, should be reserved for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in low-risk cancer patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009786,0,20198556,0,Leydig-cell-tumor of the ovary that responded to GnRH-analogue administration - case report and review of the literature.,"Progressive hirsutism can be a symptom of an androgen-producing tumor, especially in postmenopausal women. We report a case of a 58-year-old woman who complained of progressive hirsutism, nervousness, irritability, anxiousness and an increased libido. Examination showed an unusual redness of her head, décolleté, palms and soles of her feet. Basal laboratory tests revealed a profound elevation of testosterone levels (7.5 microg/l) and normal levels of androstendione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, 17alpha-hydroxy-progesterone and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Also remarkable was that her red blood count, hemoglobin and hematocrit values were elevated while erythropoietin was within normal limits. Functional laboratory tests ruled out heterozygous C21-hydroxylase deficiency and showed a moderate insulin resistance on the oral glucose tolerance test. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a slightly hyperdensic area of 6 mm in the left ovary. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a contrast medium-accumulating area of 2 cm in the left ovary. Since the patient was initially reluctant to undergo surgery, a GnRH-analogue (triptoreline) was administered VIA intramuscular injection once per month for two months and testosterone levels were lowered to less than one third of the initial level (2 microg/l). Surgery was eventually performed with laparoscopic bilateral salpingoophorectomy, hysteroscopy and uterine curettage. The histologic examination revealed a Leydig cell tumor in the hilus and stroma of the left ovary. Postoperatively testosterone levels dropped dramatically and instantly into the normal range. Within months, the red blood count and hematocrit levels were within normal limits. The patient's face became more feminine, the redness of her face and hirsutism regressed. Her anxiousness and nervosity resolved and the insulin sensitivity improved. In this paper, polyglobulia, the metabolic and psychological changes due to hyperandrogenism are discussed, as well as the phenomenon that the tumor responded to a GnRH-analogue. Such a response implies that the tumor is either under gonadotropin control or that GnRH analogues have direct effects via receptors on tumorous Leydig cells."

Operative laparoscopy has been described in the surgical staging and treatment of patients with ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. it seems to be a very promising approach with the potential to revolutionize numerous aspects of the management of gynecologic malignancies. Since 1996, the SGO has offered an operative laparoscopy course to all gynecologic oncology fellowship programs. Boike and colleagues report that faculty and fellows from 25 different fellowship programs have attended the 2-day course. In questionnaires filled out at the completion of the course, more than 85% of respondents believed that operative laparoscopic procedures were equivalent to open techniques and should be taught in fellowship programs. Despite the enthusiasm for the use of endoscopy in patients with gynecologic malignancies, its potential is unconfirmed and its hazards unknown. Reports regarding complications and long-term results are just now beginning to be published. More clinical data must be collected before the minimally invasive techniques can be accepted as new surgical standards. Ongoing prospective clinical trials will help to answer many of the questions regarding safety and efficacy. Pending the completion of additional trials, operative laparoscopy will remain a promising but unproven tool in the management of patients with gynecologic cancer."

CD009786,0,18476952,0,Laparoscopic ovarian transposition in patients with early cervical cancer.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and morbidity of laparoscopic ovarian transposition on the preservation of hormonal function in patients younger than 45 years operated for early cervical cancer. According to risk factors on pathologic evaluation of the specimen, some of them will receive postoperative pelvic radiotherapy. This subset of patients could benefit from taking the ovaries away from the irradiation field in an effort to preserve their functionality. This prospective study included 28 FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer patients, 45 years old or younger, maintaining menstrual cycles, who were considered suitable for conservation of the ovaries. The ovarian transposition was performed by laparoscopy as a part of the same celio-Schauta operation. Twelve patients underwent adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy. No intraoperative or postoperative morbidity related to the ovarian transposition was observed, and the procedure only entailed a minimum delay of the operative time. There were no cases of ovarian metastasis. At a mean follow-up of 44 months, 63.6% of patients receiving radiotherapy and 93% of those who nonirradiated maintained normal ovarian function. Two patients developed benign ovarian cysts, requiring oophorectomy, but no other long-term adverse effects of the transposition were identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series of the laparoscopic procedure reported to date in this setting. According to our results, laparoscopic ovarian transposition is a safe and effective procedure for the preservation of ovarian function in young patients with early cervical cancer undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery."

CD009786,0,21566518,0,Lymph node counts in endometrial cancer: expectations versus reality.,"It has been proposed that an adequate lymph node (LN) dissection in cases of endometrial carcinoma (CA) should contain a determined number of pelvic (P) and/or para-aortic (PA) LNs. As a result, our surgeons have certain expectations regarding the number of PLNs and PALNs reported per case. Failure to meet these expectations has become a challenge in our practice. In an attempt to solve this problem, we wanted to ascertain whether a pathology factor such as disregarding small LNs not detected on gross examination was responsible for any discrepancy between expected and reported LN counts. To achieve this goal, we evaluated the impact of the microscopic examination of residual adipose tissue (AT) after the routine processing of LN dissections performed as part of the staging procedure for patients with endometrial CA (endometrioid, serous, and clear cell CA) on the LN counts and status for hysterectomies performed from 2006 to the present. In addition, we assessed whether other factors such as surgical procedure type, operating surgeon, histologic subtype of CA, depth of myometrial invasion, or body mass index had an impact on the number of LNs obtained. The number of PLNs and PALNs were recorded. All LN specimens were processed by dissecting LNs from the surrounding AT. The number of LNs submitted per cassette was recorded in the section code. In cases in which residual AT was submitted, hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of the additional tissue were reviewed to determine the number and size of any additional LNs and their status. Two hundred fifty-eight patients had a median of 11 PLNs (range, 1 to 38) and 6 PALNs (range, 1 to 25). Fifty of 78 cases (64%) in which residual AT was submitted had additional LNs (median size, 4.0 mm): median 2 PLNs and 3 PALNs. There was no significant association between the number of LNs obtained and whether the residual AT was submitted (PLN, P=0.2; PALN, P=0.78). There were no cases in which metastatic endometrial CA was present exclusively in the additional LNs. Compared with open hysterectomy, laparoscopically and robotically obtained lymphadenectomy specimens had an average of 3 and 0.8 more PALNs, respectively (P=0.002). No similar association was found for PLNs or total LNs. Evidence for some difference in LN counts between surgeons was observed. No evidence of an association between body mass index, histologic subtype of endometrial CA or depth of myometrial invasion and LN count was identified. In our experience, the standard processing of lymphadenectomy specimens adequately reflects the actual numbers of LNs obtained in cases of endometrial CA. Submitting the residual AT does not increase the number of reported LNs or the detection of positive LNs. Additional studies are required to determine the actual numbers of PLNs and PALNs present and to determine whether a revision of the number of LNs required to consider a lymphadenectomy as adequate is necessary."

CD009786,0,819125,0,Future prospects of radiotherapy in gynecologic oncology.,"Major areas of progress in radiotherapy over the past decade have included important refinements in equipment and treatment techniques, as well as improved and expanded training programs for radiation oncologists. In 1975, approximately 14% of all new cancers were gynecologic, representing almost 68,000 new cases. Although end results in treatment of early cervix and corpus uteri lesions are quite good, results in treatment of early cervix and corpus uteri lesions are quite good, results in treatment of the later stage lesions, as well as ovarian and vulvo-vaginal tumors, are discouraging. Progress in the future will center around five primary areas: 1) greater understanding and utilization of radiation sensitizing agents such as hyperbaric oxygen, metronidazol, and other electroaffinic agents, purine and pyrimadine analogs, and antibiotics such as Actinomycin D and Adriamycin; 2) introduction into clinical use of high LET particle beams, such as fast neutrons, pi mesons, low atomic number nuclei, and heavy accelerated nuclei; 3) combined modality therapy utilizing radiation and chemotherapy or radiation and immunotherapy for management of subclinical disease; 4) radiobiologic and clinical advances in the utilization of radiation and hyperthermia; and 5) improved understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of the gynecologic malignancies with increasing use of staging laparotomies, lymphangiography and peritoneoscopy."

CD009786,0,18447057,0,[Endoscopic management of gynecological malignancies: an update. 2007].,"All the different surgical procedures used to treat gynecologic cancers have already been performed with the endoscopic approach. However, the prospective randomized trials required to confirm the oncologic efficacy of this approach are still lacking in gynecology, whereas such studies are available for abdominal surgery. Animal studies suggest that the risk of tumor dissemination in the non traumatized peritoneum may be higher after pneumoperitoneum than after laparotomy, and they also show the importance of the surgeon's experience and technique. All the parameters of pneumoperitoneum can influence the risk of postoperative dissemination. By controlling these parameters we may, in future, be able to create a peritoneal environment suitable for oncologic indications and thereby prevent or minimize the risk of peritoneal dissemination and postoperative tumor growth. In endometrial cancer, the laparoscopic approach should be reserved for clinical stage I disease, if the volume of the uterus and local conditions are appropriate for vaginal extraction. In cervical cancer, the laparoscopic approach should be reserved for patients with favorable prognostic factors (stage IB, less than 2 cm in diameter). Laparoscopy is the gold standard for surgical diagnosis of adnexal masses, but puncture should be avoided whenever possible. Surgical treatment of invasive ovarian cancer should use laparotomy, whatever the stage. In contrast, restaging of early ovarian cancer initially managed as a benign mass is a good indication for the laparoscopic approach. Laparoscopic management of tumors with low malignant potential should include complete staging of the peritoneum. An excellent knowledge of the principles of endoscopy and of oncologic surgery is required. Training in endoscopic oncological techniques will be a major challenge in the field of gynecologic surgery in coming years."

CD009786,0,15285533,0,Role of surgery in ovarian cancer: an update.,"Rupture of an ovarian malignant tumor should be avoided at the time of surgery for an early ovarian cancer. Laparoscopic removal of ovarian cysts should be restricted to patients with preoperative evidence that the cyst is benign. Degree of differentiation is the most important independent prognostic factor in stage I disease and should be used in decisions on therapy in clinical practice and the future FIGO-classification of Stage I. In early ovarian cancer staging adequacy and tumor grade were the only 2 statistical significant prognostic factors for survival in the multivariate analysis of the EORTC ACTION-trial. According to the present data there is no scientific basis to rely only on adjuvant chemotherapy or on optimal staging procedure in medium and high risk stage I ovarian cancer. Primary debulking surgery by a gynecologic oncologist remains the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer. Optimal debulking surgery should be defined as no residual tumor load. Interval debulking is defined as an operation performed after a short course of induction chemotherapy, usually 2 or 3 cycles. Based on the randomized EORTC-GCG trial, interval debulking by an experienced surgeon improves survival in some patients who did not undergo optimal primary debulking surgery. Based on the GOG 152 data, interval debulking surgery does not seem to be indicated in patients who underwent primarily a maximal surgical effort by a gynecological oncologist. Open laparoscopy is probably the most valuable tool for evaluating the operability primarily or at the time of interval debulking surgery. In retrospective analyses neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery does not seem to worsen prognosis compared to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, we will have to wait for the results of the EORTC-GCG/NCI Canada randomized trial to know whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is as good as primary debulking surgery in some or all stage IIIc and IV patients. The most suitable candidates for secondary debulking surgery are those who had an initial complete response to chemotherapy, a long treatment-free interval (e.g. more than 12 months), and resectable disease (without diffuse carcinomatosis)."

In each patient studied, a previous CA 125 level had been greater than or equal to 35 U/ml. Clinical or radiologic evidence of tumor was absent in all patients at the time of surgical evaluation. CA 125 levels were less than 35 U/ml in 36 cases (64%); 14 patients were free of tumor, while 22 were found to have tumor at surgery.

Adopting this technique in cases of suspect adnexal masses enables the reduction of spilling and ensures an intact specimen. Twenty-two consecutive patients with suspect adnexal masses 10 cm or smaller underwent laparoscopic adnexectomy. Patients with bilateral suspect ovarian masses that required bilateral adnexectomy were enrolled only if they were no longer of childbearing age. Laparoscopy was feasible in all patients. No tumor spillage occurred. In 5 patients (23.6%), minilaparotomy was required to extract the specimen. Mean (SD) operating time was 80 (35-160) minutes, and estimated blood loss was 50 (10-100) mL. No major intraoperative complications occurred. Median (range) postoperative stay was 1 (1-3) day. Definitive pathologic analysis revealed benign pathologic conditions in 18 patients (81.8%), an ovarian tumor with low malignant potential in 3 patients (13.7%), and ovarian cancer in 1 patient (4.5%) in whom findings at frozen-section analysis were inconclusive. Median (range) follow-up of malignant ovarian tumors and of tumors with low malignant potential was 27 (21-29) months. No recurrence or port-site metastasis developed during follow-up. The data are encouraging for adoption of this technique to avert spillage during laparoscopic management of suspect adnexal masses, especially those firmly adherent to the peritoneum.

Cysts with dark brown 'chocolate' fluid (n = 42) were excised by CO2-laser endoscopy. Cysts with clear fluid were diagnosed by pathology as follicular cysts (n = 5) or pseudoperitoneal cysts (n = 5). Fluids (n = 53) aspirated during echo-guided puncture for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) were assayed simultaneously. Of the 42 women undergoing a cystectomy, the clinical diagnosis of an endometrioma was confirmed by pathology in only 68%, the other cases being corpora lutea (27%) or follicular cysts (5%). Cyst fluids from corpora lutea had lower CA 125 concentrations (< 1000 IU/ml) together with high 17 beta-oestradiol concentrations (> 2000 pg/ml) and/or high progesterone concentrations (> 100 ng/ml). Endometriotic cysts had either very high CA 125 concentrations (> 10,000 IU/ml) as occurred in 78% or lower CA 125 concentrations (< 1000 IU/ml) together with low 17 beta-oestradiol and/or progesterone concentrations. 'Chocolate' fluid-containing cysts aspirated during IVF had similar concentration profiles of CA 125, 17 beta-oestradiol and progesterone and the diagnoses derived from these concentrations were not contradicted in 19/27 women undergoing a laparoscopy within 4 months. In eight women, however, with high CA 125 concentrations in their cyst fluid, no endometriotic cysts were found at laparoscopy. Only 68% of cysts containing 'chocolate' material were endometriotic cysts and CA 125 could be useful in making this diagnosis. This method is recommended when dark brown fluid is aspirated in IVF."

CD009786,0,10806907,0,[Controversies in surgical treatment of advanced ovarian cancer].,"Cytoreductive surgery has traditionally been regarded as a cornerstone in the primary treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Both five year survival and median survival are better for patients with small residual masses. Despite many similar reports showing the prognostic significance of postoperative residual tumour, the survival benefits of cytoreductive surgery still remain scientifically unproven and controversial. There have been no prospective controlled clinical trials. The question remains as to whether the observed survival benefits for patients subjected to primary cytoreductive surgery are an effect of surgery skills or tumour biology. The proponents of tumour biology claim that cytoreductive surgery is a selective procedure and that patients with better prognosis are selected. Therefore a randomized study between primary cytoreduction and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients that cannot be optimally cytoreduced seems warranted, though one problem with such a study is how to select eligible patients. During chemotherapy and after relapse several types of operations are used in ovarian cancer: secondary cytoreductive surgery, interval cytoreductive surgery, second-look surgery and palliative secondary surgery. So far interval cytoreductive surgery during chemotherapy is the only type of operation which in a prospective randomized study showed significant improvement in long-term survival. This paper discusses indirect evidence in the literature in support of or in contradiction to the primary debulking hypotheses and also indications and impact of surgical procedures during chemotherapy."

Sequencial dexamethasone and ethynyl estradiol suppression test showed a decrease in cortisol level with no change in total testosterone level on dexamethasone while an increase in testosterone from 10.5 nmol/L to 20.1 nmol/L was observed ten days after ethynil estradiol had been associated to dexamethasone. When a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (gonadorelin 3.5 mg i.m.) was administered for 2 months, serum gonadotropins levels decreased to less than 2 IU/L, total testosterone to 3.8 nmol/L and estradiol to less than 36 pmol/L. The patient was submitted to a pelvic exploratory laparotomy and a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. A solid and circumscribed ovarian tumor of 1.0 cm in diameter was found. The pathological diagnosis was a Leydig cell tumor with surrounding stromal hyperplasia.

Histopathology of the resected specimen showed it to be metastasis from solid-tubular carcinoma of the breast. We should be aware that breast cancer can metastasise to the gastrointestinal tract even after the long interval from initial therapy. An index of high suspicion and detailed assessment is mandatory to make a correct diagnosis and following less invasive surgical treatment."

Forty-nine patients were classified as having new disease or were to have reassessment of disease, and seven cases were to be restaged (one with and six without clinical evidence of disease). Of new and reassessment cases, 44 patients underwent lymphography, 16 underwent peritoneoscopy with diaphragmatic inspection and 30 had peritoneal cytologic testing performed. Positive lymphography resulted in restaging in 31.6% of patients. Diaphragmatic inspection was always negative. Peritoneal cytologic testing was positive for malignant cells in three patients and worsened the stage in one. Pathologic staging of disease was as follows: Stage IA, 24; Stage IB, one Stage IC, one; Stage III peritoneal disease, two. Stage III retroperitoneal disease, 12; Stage III peritoneal and retroperitoneal disease; four. The 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 91% in patients with pathologic Stages IA, IB, and IC; 74% in those with Stage III retroperitoneal disease, and 24% in patients with Stage III peritoneal disease or peritoneal plus retroperitoneal disease. The results indicate that the prognosis is excellent for patients with Stage I and Stage III retroperitoneal disease whereas peritoneal involvement is associated with a poor prognosis."

Several risk factors such as chronic peritoneal irritation, caused by foreign bodies, infection or endometriosis, were hypothesized but the pathogenesis is still unknown. A 51-year menopausal woman was submitted to ultrasonography because of abnormal uterine bleeding. The scan revealed a right ovarian cyst (size 81 x 64 mm) with the feature of serous cyst. In the anamnesis a cystectomy of the right ovary and appendectomy were reported. At laparoscopy, then converted in laparotomy, a cyst arising from peritoneum of the posterior surface of the uterus was found. The right ovary was normal. The histopathological finding was: serous simple cyst of peritoneum. Ultrasonographic diagnosis was not confirmed by surgery; in fact, sometimes, it may be difficult to establish the origin of pelvic cystic mass, from ovary or peritoneum, by ultrasonography. It is mandatory to suggest a laparoscopy and/or laparotomy in case of pelvic cystic mass that does not regress in the time even after administration of oral contraceptives."
CD009786,0,18971141,0,Occult fallopian tube cancer in a patient with BRCA1 breast cancer.,"Primary fallopian tube cancer is very rare form of ovarian cancer. However, despite the infrequent incidence, emerging evidence suggests that patients who have a deleterious mutation of BRCA1 or -2 mutation may be more vulnerable to developing this disease. A patient with breast carcinoma was initially treated for her disease in 1994. She had a new primary lesion on the contralateral side in 2001 and was eventually identified with a positive BRCA1 germline mutation in 2007. The patient subsequently underwent a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy surgery performed by her gynecologist. Final pathology revealed occult stage IIC fallopian tube cancer with bilateral ovarian serosal involvement. Consequently, the patient was referred to gynecologic oncology and underwent a pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopic omentectomy, followed by chemotherapy. Although fallopian tube cancer is rare, women who are positive for the BRCA mutation are at greater risk for developing this disease. Therefore, physicians should consider the associated risk factors and perform comprehensive risk-reducing surgery and staging when treating these patients."
CD009786,0,20079589,0,Laparoscopic surgery for gynaecological cancers in obese women.,"The use of laparoscopic surgery in the management of gynaecological malignancies has been growing for over a decade. Concomitantly the incidence of obesity has been increasing worldwide. This review summarizes the available studies on minimal invasive surgery in obese women with gynaecological malignancies. We undertook a literature search to identify the differences between traditional open methods and the laparoscopic approach in terms of intra- and postoperative outcome and patient safety. Only eight relevant studies were identified. Six of these focused on endometrial cancer, one study included early stage cervical and ovarian cancers with other benign conditions, while another paper included cervical and endometrial pre-cancers and only a few malignant conditions. Obesity is generally known to increase the risk of intra- and postoperative complications. However, several studies show that obesity, formerly precluding keyhole surgery, seems now to be an indication for the laparoscopic approach. As compared to laparotomy, laparoscopic surgery has a good postoperative outcome, reduced estimated blood loss (EBL) and pain and in some series an increased lymph node count. Laparoscopy has been shown to be cost effective with a shorter hospital stay and return to normal activity. Survival is reported to be the same with both laparotomy and laparoscopy. The benefits of minimal invasive surgery in gynaecological surgery are starting to be found with robotic surgery."

CD009786,0,11091991,0,Female sterilization. Evidence.,"The literature review herein reveals substantial information regarding the safety, efficacy, short-term complications, long-term complications, and noncontraceptive benefits of sterilization. This information should be helpful for providers and potential sterilization candidates. The review also reveals areas where the data are unclear. Points to keep in mind during counseling include the following: The vast majority of women are satisfied with the decision to undergo sterilization. The fact that regret occurs underscores the importance of counseling and adequate individual deliberation before the procedure. In addition to the difficulty and expense associated with sterilization reversal, the woman should thoroughly understand the permanence of the procedure. Although failure is a rare event, it can occur many years after the procedure. Although evidence suggests that hysterectomy rates are higher in sterilized women aged less than 30 to 35 years, it is unlikely that there is a plausible biologic effect of sterilization on hysterectomy risk. An association between tubal sterilization and menstrual cycle changes does not seem valid for changes noted up to 2 years after the procedure. Data are unclear and inconsistent among studies observing women more than 2 years after the procedure. Evidence consistently shows that sterilization is associated with a reduced incidence of ovarian cancer and pelvic inflammatory diseases. Most studies show no effect or improvement of sexual satisfaction after sterilization. Complications during and postprocedure are rare. Sterilization provides no protection against the acquisition of sexually transmitted disease. Patients and their physicians should recognize that sterilized women may need more targeted preventive efforts for health screening and to reduce high-risk behavior than women who use other contraceptive methods. The surgeon's experience and the woman's preferences should govern the ultimate decision regarding the approach and occlusion method. Level II-2 evidence indicates comparable safety between interval laparoscopy and minilaparotomy. Data consistently show that in experienced trained hands, tubal sterilization is safe and highly effective regardless of the approach or occlusive method. Attention to the subtleties of technique seems to be most important in ensuring procedure safety and efficacy. Reanalysis of the CREST data shows that the cumulative failure rate of bipolar coagulation is comparable with the failure rate of unipolar coagulation if a substantial length of tube is adequately coagulated. The data discussed herein can be used to guide management decisions that may increase accessibility and reduce cost of the procedure. Low-resource settings and office settings have maintained an excellent safety record for this procedure through performance of sterilization under local anesthesia. The use of local anesthesia enables a change in procedure location from an inpatient operating room to a free-standing surgical clinic or adequately equipped office. Local anesthesia, with or without preoperative medication, is an excellent option associated with a lower complication risk, reduced cost, and shorter, easier recovery. The surgeon should have specific training in the effective use of local anesthetics, preoperative medications, and management of rare complications in low-resource settings. Little additional research is needed regarding the safety and efficacy of standard sterilization approaches and occlusion methods. There is a need for continued development of nonsurgical methods of sterilization, microlaparoscopic approaches performed in the office setting, and the feasibility and acceptance of service provision by nonspecialist health care providers. The evidence indicates that female sterilization can be performed safely in a variety of resource settings ranging from rural sterilization camps in developing countries to high-tech, resource-rich operating rooms in developed c"

Pathologically, it is the result of functional endometrium located outside the uterus. It may vary from microscopic endometriotic implants to large cysts (endometriomas). The physical manifestations are protean, with some patients being asymptomatic and others having disabling pelvic pain, infertility, or adnexal masses. Symptoms do not necessarily correlate with the severity of the disease. Ultrasonographic (US) features are variable and can mimic those of other benign and malignant ovarian lesions. Low-level internal echoes and echogenic wall foci are more specific US features for endometriomas. Magnetic resonance imaging improves diagnostic accuracy, with endometriotic cysts typically appearing with high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and demonstrating ""shading"" on T2-weighted images. The ovaries are the most common sites affected, but endometriosis can also involve the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, chest, and soft tissues. Small implants and adhesions are not well evaluated radiologically; therefore, laparoscopy remains the standard of reference for diagnosis and staging. Both medical and surgical treatment options are available depending on the patient's specific case."

The first patient, age 36, presented with bilateral lower extremity deep vein thromboses, pulmonary embolism, and supraclavicular and cervical lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy revealed metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma with focal signet ring cell differentiation. Imaging studies demonstrated metastatic disease without a defined primary site. Acute renal and respiratory failure developed and the patient expired shortly after initiation of chemotherapy, 7 weeks after presentation. Autopsy examination revealed widespread metastatic adenocarcinoma with a 2 cm cervical adenocarcinoma. The second patient, age 43, presented with left internal jugular vein thrombosis, acute thrombophlebitis, and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. She developed progressive venous thrombosis despite anticoagulation. Imaging studies demonstrated widespread lymphadenopathy and an adnexal mass. Diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsies and left oophorectomy revealed metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell differentiation involving peritoneum, ovary, cervix, and bladder without a defined primary site. Progressive thromboembolic disease with acute renal failure and multiple cerebral infarcts developed and the patient expired shortly after initiation of chemotherapy, 2 months after presentation. No autopsy was performed. HPV DNA was detected by in situ hybridization in the lymph node metastasis in the first case and in the cervical and ovarian tumor specimens in the second case. High-risk HPV-related endocervical adenocarcinomas occasionally exhibit signet ring cell differentiation and can present with Trousseau syndrome. These features more commonly suggest metastatic adenocarcinoma of upper gastrointestinal tract origin but the presence of HPV DNA within the tumors establishes them as cervical in origin."

Forty-four cases of women with an ovarian mass were retrospectively analyzed. These patients, aged between 12 and 21 years, had 47 ovarian masses (three patients had bilateral lesions), of which 49% were non-neoplastic and 51% were neoplastic. Of the neoplastic lesions, 62.5% were germ cell tumors, 20.8% were epithelial and 16.7% were sex cord-stromal tumors. Of the neoplastic tumors, 95.8% were benign while 4.2% were malignant.

The majority of ovarian tumors occurring in adolescents are non-epithelial in origin, and germ cell tumors are the most common histological type. Ultrasound examination is one of the most important diagnostic tools. Preoperative diagnostic approach of these patients should always include careful history taking, physical examination, imaging and evaluation of serum assays.

CD009786,0,10883021,0,Management of adnexal masses: role and risk of laparoscopy.,"Laparoscopic surgery has become the gold standard in the treatment of benign adnexal masses, whereas laparotomy remains the standard for the treatment of malignant tumors. The laparoscopic management of adnexal masses remains controversial because of the potential risks of cancer dissemination suggested by many case reports and national surveys. Experimental data show potential advantages and disadvantages for the laparoscopic treatment of gynecologic cancer. Since the risk of dissemination appears high when a large number of malignant cells are present, adnexal tumors with external growths and bulky lymph nodes may be considered contra-indications to CO(2) laparoscopy. Surgical diagnosis is the key to adequate management of adnexal masses. In our experience, laparoscopic diagnosis of malignancy is reliable after a careful pre-operative evaluation has been performed. Moreover, national surveys have revealed that despite suspicious laparoscopic findings, many malignant masses were considered benign at the outset. Using strict guidelines, laparoscopic diagnosis can be proposed for both non-suspicious and complex masses, thus avoiding many unnecessary laparotomies for benign masses suspicious at ultrasound. The more controversial limits of laparoscopic treatment are discussed. If a laparotomy was performed for all masses suspicious at surgery, 80% of the cases would be treated by laparoscopy. The role of laparoscopy for restaging and second-look operations for ovarian cancer requires further evaluation."
CD009786,0,10883022,0,Surgical staging of early invasive epithelial ovarian tumors.,"Early stage epithelial ovarian carcinoma is defined pathologically as a tumor strictly limited to one or both ovaries without any extra-ovarian disease (i.e., Stage IA or B of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification). This diagnosis can be obtained only after an exhaustive surgical staging procedure, performed as soon as the diagnosis of epithelial invasive ovarian carcinoma is established. This staging surgery currently encompasses a peritoneal cytology, the thorough inspection of all the visceral and parietal peritoneal surfaces with biopsy of any abnormality, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH + BSO), random peritoneal biopsies, omentectomy, appendectomy and bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomies, up to the left renal vein. The results of this staging procedure and its indications are discussed. In all of the cases, the radical removal of the pathologic adnexa is indicated, along with the complete peritoneal and retroperitoneal staging. While fertility-sparing surgery (avoiding hysterectomy and contralateral adnexectomy, if possible) seems to be safe for young women, a TAH + BSO is the rule for the others. Adjuvant chemotherapy can be omitted in well-differentiated tumors with a negative staging operation, but currently it remains indicated in all other cases. Indeed, the ultimate goal in early stage ovarian carcinoma is to not impair by inadequate management the high chance of a cure."
CD009786,0,10883025,0,Second-look and second surgery: second chance or second best?,"About 40 years ago, second-look laparotomy (SLL) was introduced to evaluate, surgically and pathologically, primary treatment in case a clinical complete remission was obtained in ovarian cancer patients. But does SLL increase the disease-free or overall survival? Important technical aspects of the procedure as: how many biopsies should be taken, can laparoscopy be replaced by laparotomy and should complete lymphadnectomy be performed at SLL, are still not clarified. This and maybe even more important issues, are disputed in literature: for instance, should a SLL be done at all, or should a SLL be performed in order to do a secondary cytoreduction in case tumour is found at the operation. If clinical remission is reached in more than 50% of the patients with advanced disease, tumour still can be found at SLL. If no tumour is found at SLL, macroscopically or microscopically, the operation is redundant. Apart from this, the recurrence rate after such a ""negative SLL"" is about 35%. Whether tumour found at SLL should be removed will depend on the fact if the tumour still is responsive to chemotherapy. To minimise the chance of tumour resistance, secondary surgery should be done as early as possible during treatment. Therefore, an interval debulking will be the intervention of choice. So, as long as there is no evidence that SLL increases the survival in ovarian cancer patients, it should be done in a research setting only. Also, the usefulness of secondary surgery for recurrent disease mainly depends on the chemo-sensitivity of the tumour. After a complete remission, which lasts for more than a year, complete secondary cytoreduction, again followed by chemotherapy, improves survival."

The purpose is to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment starting with NAC and also to know whether we can accurately diagnose these advanced carcinomas by imaging studies, cytologic findings and tumor markers without staging laparotomy or laparoscopy. Fifty-six patients with advanced müllerian carcinomas will be recruited to the study. After confirmation of diagnosis by laparoscopic inspection and biopsies, patients undergo four cycles of chemotherapy as NAC, followed by ICS and an additional four cycles of post-surgical chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is proportion of clinical complete remission after accomplishment of the protocol treatment, while the major secondary endpoint is positive predictive value of diagnosis before laparoscopy regarding tumor origin, histology and stage. Based on the results of this study, we will conduct a phase III study to compare the treatment starting with NAC and primary cytoreductive surgery followed by post-surgical chemotherapy."

After laparoscopical confirmation of endometriosis, 59 patients were randomized to receive danazol (200 mg 3 times daily), MPA (100 mg daily) or placebo for 6 months. Clinical examinations were done before and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the beginning of the study, and a 2nd laparoscopy 6 months after termination of the medication. Eighteen patients in the danazol group, 16 in the MPA group and 17 in the placebo group completed the trial. Total or partial resolution of peritoneal implants was observed in 60% of the patients receiving danazol and in 63% of the patients receiving MPA. In the placebo group, resolution was observed in 18%, while the size of the implants was estimated to be increased in 23% of the patients. In relation to placebo, danazol and MPA significantly alleviated endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, lower back pain and defecation pain, but they did not differ from each other in these actions. The appearance of acne, muscle cramps, edema, weight gain and spotting bleeding complicated MPA treatment. The present results indicate that because of good efficacy and tolerance, high-dose MPA is a useful alternative in the hormonal treatment of endometriosis."

CD009786,0,21194826,0,Ovarian tumours in pregnancy: a literature review.,"Ovarian tumours in pregnancy are a diagnostic and management challenge that is increasingly being faced by the clinician. While most masses are benign and resolve spontaneously, there are others that persist and indicate the need for surgical management. Ultrasound not only detects asymptomatic masses but also helps to guide their management based on presence or absence of features suspicious of malignancy. The role of tumour markers in pregnancy is limited due to their non-specific nature. Most masses treated in pregnancy are benign (most commonly dermoids), and most malignancies are either of low malignant potential or germ cell tumours, usually early stage disease. Surgical management is indicated for symptomatic masses or those with increasing size or complexity indicating possible malignancy. Both laparoscopy and laparotomy have similar results with regard to obstetric outcome. Conservative management is preferred in the remainder. MRI may help in better characterization of doubtful masses. National tumour registries can help to establish guidelines."

At the age of 31 years she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had undergone surgical breast conservation of the right breast. There was a history of both ovarian cancer and breast cancer in her family. Genetic evaluation showed that she was carrying a BRCAI germline mutation. At the age of 42 years she underwent a prophylactic bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy and 5 years later she underwent a complete mastectomy due to breast carcinoma of the left breast. Two months later she developed ascites, a raised CA125 level and on a CT scan carcinoma of the peritoneum. During the laparotomy a fallopian tube carcinoma was found. After the uterus, fallopian tubes and omentum had been surgically removed, chemotherapy took place. The patient tolerated this well and the CA125 value decreased. Recently, the first molecular evidence was found that linked fallopian tube cancer to germline mutations in BRCAI patients. Patients harbouring a BRCA germline mutation not only have an increased risk of ovarian carcinoma but also of fallopian tube carcinoma. Therefore, in patients with a BRCA mutation, prophylactic surgery should take the form of an adnexectomy, not an oophorectomy."

The period of time is quite long compared to the evolving of mini-invasive techniques and also unequal towards the experience of the surgeons who perform these procedure. The total number of hysterectomies was 1491 from which 251 by laparoscopic approach, the rest being made by the classic methods (most of them by laparotomy and some by vaginal approach). In the statistic we have included 15 myomectomies, 4 cases of radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and 4 cases of complete hysterectomy after partial procedures made by laparotomy. The indications were represented mostly by uterine fibroma (82.07%), but also by uterine prolapse (13.14%), uterine bleeding, cervix severe dysplasia, uterine and cervix neoplasia (stage I) or associated to ovariectomy related to breast cancer. The paper analyses the results looking at the incidents and accidents (hemorrhagic, ureteral, urinary bladder or rectal lesions) and also postoperative complications (we had three reinterventions, two by laparoscopy and one by laparotomy). We also recorded one death not directly as a consequence of surgery, but as a diagnosis error. Regarding the surgical technique we initially chose the laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Afterwards by gaining experience we started treating the uterine pedicle and now we settled for the integral laparoscopic procedure. In our opinion laparoscopic hysterectomy represents all the advantages of mini-invasive approach. The technological development, but essentially the experience gained by surgeons are the key factors in accepting and promulgating the technique."

Because of previous surgical history a specific technique is necessary including safety tests, cytologic evaluation after peritoneal washing, and biopsies of any abnormal peritoneal areas, original tumors sites and normal appearing peritoneum. In order to achieve the evaluation of the entire peritoneal cavity a complete bowel adhesiolysis is required. For trained laparoscopists the surgical complication rate is low.

We report an open-label, two-center, phase II study of upfront paclitaxel for patients with histological diagnosis of stage III ovarian carcinoma. Treatment consisted of paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 administered in a 3-h infusion every 21 days. Response was evaluated after the third course by either laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy. Patients with stable or progressive disease discontinued treatment, whereas responding patients continued treatment until a maximum of six courses. Response, toxicity, time to progression (TTP) and survival were evaluated. From November 1993 to December 1995, 30 patients were accrued. All patients underwent primary cytoreduction; 17 (57%) and 13 (43%) patients had residual tumors <2 and >2 cm, respectively. Of 27 patients evaluable, objective responses were seen in 18 (66.4%) (95% CI 49.5-83.2)--12 complete (45%) and six partial (22%). Four patients had stable disease (15%) and five (18%) patients progressed. A total of 149 courses were administered to 30 patients, median 4 (range 1-6). Grade 3/4 neutropenia was seen in 13% of courses, peripheral neuropathy, myalgia and arthralgia were frequent, but transitory and relieved with analgesics. At a median follow-up time of 44.5 months (0-99) the TTP and median survival were 16.6 and 43.1 months, respectively.

Altogether, 90 patients were enrolled and only 4 were not suitable for tru-cut biopsy. The biopsy was taken either from pelvic tumor (54.6%), peritoneal visceral or parietal metastases (31.4%), or omental cake (14%). Samples were obtained transvaginally (53.5%) or transabdominally (46.5%). A diagnosis consistent with primary ovarian malignancy was made in 62.8%, metastatic ovarian involvement was found in 10.5%, and extraovarian tumor in 26.7%. The obtained tissue was adequate for histologic diagnosis in 80 out of 86 cases. In four cases, repeated biopsy was required to obtain a sufficient tissue sample. False-negative samples without tumor tissue were obtained in two cases, and those patients were referred for either laparoscopy or minilaparotomy. The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound-guided tru-cut biopsy reached 97.7% (95% CI 91.85-99.72%). There was only one complication, a bleeding from tumor in a patient with mild thrombocytopenia, requiring laparotomy. In conclusion, ultrasound-guided tru-cut biopsy is safe, reliable, and cost-effective diagnostic method.

In postmenopausal women, serum CA-125 determinations further improve sensitivity and specificity. Once the presence of an ovarian mass is established, the crucial decision is whether to observe the patient or proceed with surgical removal. If surgical removal is indicated, the proper procedure is important for staging and initiation of effective therapy. While many surgeons are now using the less invasive laparoscopic approach, the standard of care continues to be a laparotomy with either an ovarian cystectomy or oophorectomy. Future clinical research in the management of adnexal masses should focus on decreasing the number of patients undergoing a surgical procedure, and in patients who require surgery, further evaluation of laparoscopy as a safe, cost-effective means of treatment. Improved imaging techniques may allow for nonoperative management of probably benign ovarian neoplasms."

CD009786,0,8458916,0,Lasers in infertility.,"Lasers have been used in fertility surgery for the past two decades. This article reviews the development of different wavelength lasers, the different tissue effects and their applications in infertility surgery. The CO2 laser remains the most precise laser, especially in the ultrapulse mode, for the division of adhesions and the accurate and safe vaporization of deposits of endometriosis. The neodymium:YAG laser, because of its greater depth of penetration, is more suited to hysteroscopic surgery, and attempts to focus the energy by sapphire tips and sculpted quartz fibres merely enable tissue to be incised by a thermal effect. Carbon dioxide laser energy is strongly absorbed by the water molecule and is rendered ineffective in the presence of blood so the visible light lasers, argon and potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP/532) lasers, are more suitable for the treatment of ovarian endometriomas and ectopic pregnancies. Techniques and results of laser surgery in endometriosis, tubal surgery, ectopic pregnancy and polycystic ovarian syndrome are reviewed. The main advantage of the various lasers is that they allow fertility surgeons to perform operative surgery by the minimally invasive approach of laparoscopy rather than laparotomy."

Robotic hysterectomies (RH), like traditional laparoscopic hysterectomies (LH), involve a significant amount of uterine manipulation. The use of a manipulator is thought to possibly increase the incidence of artifactual tumor displacement beyond the endometrium, including the fallopian tube. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is an association between RH and tumor present in the fallopian tube lumina. All RH and LH cases performed for endometrial cancer from May 2007 to August 2009 were reviewed. Of the cases not converted to laparotomy, 137 RH and 184 LH were identified. Age, body mass index, operative and hysterectomy time, type and grade of tumor, stage, pelvic wash results, and the presence of detached tumor fragments (contaminants) in the lumina of the fallopian tubes were recorded. Appropriate statistical tests were applied. Of the 184 LH, 4 (2.2%) were reported to have detached fragments of tumor in the lumina of the fallopian tubes compared with 16 of the 137 (11.7%) RH cases (P<0.001). The majority of the patients with RH and tumor present in the tubes had Stage I disease (9/16, 56.2%) and Grade 1 tumors (9/16, 56.2%). Four (4/16, 25%) patients had Stage IIIa disease detected by a pelvic wash. Patients with contaminants had a higher body mass index, but the difference was not statistically significant and was possibly due to small numbers. In conclusion, our data demonstrate an association between RH and tubal contamination. The clinical significance of this phenomenon remains to be determined."

It was carried out prospectively at Dr. Zekai Tahir Burak Women's Hospital of Ankara, Turkey. 943 women with 1035 adnexal masses who had undergone laparotomy and/or laparoscopy between January 1989 and March 1995 were included into the study group. All of these patients had a sonographic preoperatively examination within one week of surgery and the sonographic diagnosis was compared to histopathological findings. The visualization of: 1. echogenic mass with or without acoustic shadowing or enhancement (assumed to represent sebum with lipophilic contaminants or with hair) 2. Dermoid plug; layered lines and dots; fat-fluid level; isolated brigth echogenic foci with acoustic shadowing within the complex mass (assumed to represent Rokitansky protuberance; hair in low viscosity fluid; sebum as a supernatant of serous fluid; teeth or bone fragments respectively) 3. intraovarian echogenic mass with or without acoustic shadowing or enhancement (assumed to represent intraovarian dermoid cyst) were chosen as characteristical sonographic findings of dermoid cysts. Combining these with the subjective visual assessment of the operator, the sensitivity and the specificity were calculated for each visualized adnexal mass to assess the efficiency of sonography in differentiating dermoid cysts from other ovarian masses. All in all 1035 adnexal masses were visualized, 155 were suspected to be dermoid cysts and the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology in only 147 cases. The sensitivity and specificity of sonography were 94% and 99% respectively. As a conclusion this study demonstrates that ultrasonography has an accuracy of 98% in differentiating dermoid cysts from other adnexal masses with a specificity of 99%."

Apart metastatic spread more frequent in group B (A vs B = 10 vs 32%) and tumor grade 1 more frequent in group B (A vs B = 33 vs 49%), the two groups were well balanced concerning tumor characteristics and treatment features. All patients had received a complementary treatment after the second-look procedures.

Within group A, 34 patients had achieved pathologic proved complete remission. Their 5-year survival was 73% with an incidence of recurrence of 32%. Second-look laparotomy was found an invasive technique with a 15% operative morbidity. Its therapeutic apport seems absent and the diagnostic role limited to indication of radiotherapy in CR patients. Second-look laparotomies should be reserved to trials evaluating its proper place but should not be used systematically to assess tumor response to chemotherapy.

Forty-three patients had either an ovarian or a peritoneal biopsy performed after peritoneal lavage. The results indicate that 25% of the washings performed were successful in demonstrating endometrial glands or stroma. On the other hand, 72% of the patients on whom biopsies were performed showed endometrial tissue, and biopsy failures were mainly related to the technical difficulties of the ovarian biopsy. In 46% of the histologically proven cases of endometriosis, peritoneal lavage failed to demonstrate endometrial tissue. Conversely, in 4.6% of the negative biopsy cases, peritoneal lavage showed endometrial glands. We conclude that exfoliative cytology is not a useful tool in the diagnosis of endometriosis. On the other hand, we were able to make the diagnosis by biopsy in more than 70% of the patients on whom biopsies were performed."

Technologic advances and the proliferation of new equipment have occurred at a rapid rate. However, the criteria for the safe and appropriate use of endoscopic surgery have not been developed fully or followed by all surgeons, and there is some evidence that a lack of adherence to carefully considered protocols has the potential to have an adverse impact on women with ovarian lesions. McDonough made a thoughtful presentation on the need for technology assessment in the reproductive sciences, focusing on the fact that there has been a rapid diffusion of technology without prior broad-based critical peer review and stressing the need to have scientific technology assessment. Pitkin, in his editorial on operative laparoscopy, questioned whether we are evaluating therapeutic appropriateness properly as a separate and independent issue from technical feasibility. Obviously, it would be preferable to have had more controlled prospective data on the relative merits and risks of the use of the laparoscope for resection of ovarian cysts before the widespread use of this technology. However, there are several situations in which it currently appears to have important clinical utility for the patient. In addition, it already is being used widely, and it would be inappropriate to withhold this method from our patients. However, it should be urged that careful prospective evaluation be undertaken so that both the scientific community and the public are able to have an accurate understanding of the risks, benefits, indications, and contraindications of this technology. In addition, when a surgeon is considering pelviscopic surgery for an ovarian mass, it is essential that this be done with strict adherence to carefully constructed preoperative criteria and intraoperative protocols."

CD009786,0,11591271,0,Clomiphene citrate in the twenty-first century.,"Clomiphene citrate is the drug most commonly prescribed for ovulation induction. It is the first choice medication in normogonadotrophic oligo/amenorrhoeic infertility (WHO group 2), essentially associated with polycystic ovaries. Anovulatory women who are responsive to clomiphene citrate should be treated for at least six cycles and the treatment should probably be limited to a maximum of 12 cycles. It is necessary to monitor at least the first cycle with ultrasonography because of the risk of multiple pregnancy and the variable response of patients to different doses of clomiphene. In addition, the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome should not be underestimated. More triplets and higher order pregnancies result from ovulation induction than from in vitro fertilization, and multiple pregnancy has many risks for both mother and babies. The role of empirical clomiphene in the treatment of unexplained infertility is debatable and the present data are inconclusive. Obesity, hyperandrogenaemia and insulin resistance are important factors in clomiphene-resistant patients. Failure to ovulate in response to clomiphene has been approached by either medical or surgical treatment. An effective alternative medical treatment is gonadotrophin injections. Treatment with metformin and the new generation of insulin-sensitizing drugs is under evaluation. The most widely used surgical treatment today is laparoscopic ovarian drilling, which appears to be as effective as gonadotrophin therapy."

Similarly, laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy has been systematically described, is feasible, and can be offered to women with early-stage cervical cancer who do not desire future childbearing. In the treatment of early-stage endometrial cancer, the surgical approach of laparoscopic hysterectomy, peritoneal washings, and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, with or without an omentectomy, is being compared with the same surgery performed via laparotomy in the cooperative Gynecologic Oncology Group LAP 2 study, which has completed accrual, and appears to be a reasonable surgical option. In ovarian cancer, minimally invasive surgery has been incorporated to manage early-stage, advanced-stage, and recurrent disease, as well as second-look procedures.

Especially the peritoneal macrophages (m phi) could play an important role in defense against tumor cells. To study the cellular composition in the peritoneal cavity and the functional capacities of PC, these cells were obtained from three patients with EOC. The PC were immunophenotyped and tested functionally in vitro in a cytotoxicity assay. One of the patients was treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single dose of 0.06 mg/m2 tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). PC were obtained before the treatment, after 24 h and after 1 week. PC from healthy women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization served as controls. It appeared that patients with EOC have a lower percentage of macrophages (m phi) in the peritoneal cavity than healthy persons. These m phi of patients were also less capable of killing U 937 tumor cells as compared to the peritoneal m phi of control persons. However, in the patient treated i.p. with TNF-alpha the cytotoxic capacities of the peritoneal m phi were strongly improved. The percentage cytotoxicity at an effector to target ratio of 10, increased from 17% to 80%. Thus, the peritoneal m phi in this patient were activated in vivo to a tumoricidal state. These findings indicate that PC in patients with EOC differ from controls, but further investigation is necessary to define the contribution of the disease and/or prior chemotherapy to this defect."

CD009786,0,7605086,0,Comparison of the usefulness of serum CA 125 level and a risk scoring system in detecting malignancy in ovarian cysts.,"A prospective study was carried out to compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the accuracy of serum CA 125 measurement with a clinical risk scoring system in the detection of malignant ovarian cysts. One hundred and three patients admitted to one department of obstetrics and gynaecology within a 12-month period were studied. There were 22 cases of malignant ovarian cysts. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were 81.8%, 72.0%, 43.9%, 93.7% and 75.0% respectively for a raised serum CA 125 measurement (> or = 35 u/ml) alone, and 90.9%, 64.8%, 40.8%, 96.4% and 70.2% respectively for a high risk score system (> or = 7 scores) alone. The specificity and positive predictive value were both further improved to 93.9% by combining a raised CA 125 level and high risk score of 7 or more as the predictive test. When used alone, the clinical risk scoring system picked up more FIGO stage I ovarian cancer than the raised serum CA 125 level. The findings of this study indicated that the risk scoring system is a useful predictor of malignant ovarian cysts. It needs to be assessed further in populations with different prevalence of ovarian cysts of various pathological types and malignancy before it can be advocated for general application, particularly in selecting ovarian cysts for laparoscopic surgery."
CD009786,0,22134021,0,Laparoscopy in pregnancy and the pediatric patient.,"Minimally invasive surgery is now standard of care for many procedures in pediatric gynecology. Laparoscopy has been well documented to produce faster recovery,decreased postoperative pain, and because of smaller incisions, a better cosmetic result. These are important when considering an active pediatric patient. Although a laparoscopic approach to endometriosis, adnexal masses, and ovarian torsion are well supported in the literature in the pediatric patient, more data are needed with regard to SILS in younger patients. Laparoscopy seems to be a better approach to oopheropexy in children undergoing radiation, and in resection of certain mullerian anomalies; however, the numbers are low.Similarly in pregnant patients, laparoscopy provides for shorter recovery times,decrease analgesic use and shorter hospital stays. Concerns about poor fetal outcomes in surgery during pregnancy for non gynecologic problems have been brought to light; however, the evidence indicates that these outcomes can be attributed to the nature of the underlying disease and not the surgical approach. With regard to pneumoperitoneum the effect of CO2 insufflation on fetal physiology and long-term outcomes remains unclear, and will continue to be an issue of controversy until larger studies are published.With both the pediatric and pregnant populations, laparoscopic complications can be diminished when performed by skilled surgeons with strict adherence to good technical principles. The advantages of laparoscopy are great, and this approach should be considered in pediatric and pregnant patients."
CD009786,0,8329645,0,Surgery for malignant gynecologic disease.,"The surgical management of malignant gynecologic disease continues to evolve as more is learned about the natural history and biology of these neoplasms. Whereas curing malignancies remains the ultimate goal of most surgical procedures for gynecologic cancers, the importance of quality of life cannot be ignored. Surgical procedures that enhance the quality of life without compromising cure continue to be explored. In vulvar cancer, the disfiguring classical radical vulvectomy is being replaced by more conservative procedures. As anesthetic techniques and postoperative care continue to improve, the role of radical surgery for invasive and recurrent cervical cancer has been extended to include older women. Ovarian cancer continues to be the most lethal of all gynecologic malignancies, and the role of aggressive primary and secondary cytoreduction continues to be defined. The new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system for endometrial cancer has generated controversy regarding the benefits and morbidity associated with surgical staging."

CD009786,0,8875037,0,Laparoscopic surgery for ovarian cysts.,"Laparoscopic surgery for ovarian cysts is one of the most frequent laparoscopic surgical procedures performed presently. The routine use of pelvic imaging (sonography), in the case of any gynaecological symptom or as a screening method in women at risk, explains why more and more ovarian cysts are encountered. The diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the clinician to provide the best immediate and long-term benefits for the patient is to identify pre-operatively not only an ovarian malignancy (to be treated in a conventional way) but also functional cysts (usually disappearing spontaneously and requiring no form of treatment in most cases). Ideally, only benign 'organic' cysts should be treated laparoscopically. The technical aspects and the benefits of this approach have been documented extensively in recent years. The routine use of the 'closed technique' and of an impermeable bag for removal should limit the risk of spillage of the cyst contents with its inherent potential problems (chemical peritonitis, malignant cell dissemination and parietal implantation into the laparoscopic port sites). The adnexal torsion can be also properly managed by laparoscopic surgery."

Because of evidence supporting the effectiveness of both single agent platinum (P) and the combination of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (CA), patients were treated with alternating cycles of CA and CP. Primary surgery to remove the bulk of tumor to less than 2 cm was possible in 45% of the 85 eligible patients, and an additional 17% had similar surgery after two to four cycles of chemotherapy. Fifteen percent of patients progressed on chemotherapy. Of the 68 who were clinically and radiologically without disease at the completion of chemotherapy, 91% had second-look surgery. Forty-eight percent of these women had residual disease. All patients but one are at risk for greater than 60 months, with a median follow-up of 86 months. Overall 5-year survival is 26%, with a median survival of 33 months. Twenty patients survived over 5 years with 11 continuing to be free of disease (13% of all eligible patients). Patients with modified Broder's grade I,II tumors have not yet reached a median survival.

CD009786,0,15462594,0,The role of laparoscopy in gynecologic oncology.,"In some patients and when performed by a skillful surgeon, gynecologic oncologist familiar with advanced laparoscopic techniques, laparoscopy results with less surgical trauma, reduced blood loss and hospitalization, and faster recovery. The complication rate has been found to increase as the complexity of the operation rises, but it is not higher than in open surgery. Preliminary studies show that recurrence and survival rates are comparable to those reported for patients treated by a standard abdominal approach. Future randomised trials are necessary to deal with long term recurrences and survival data and benefits of laparoscopy in management of gynecologic malignancies. At our institution 97 cancer patients underwent laparoscopic procedures, without complications: explorative and staging laparoscopies with biopsies of ovaries, peritoneal biopsies, retroperitoneal and mesenteric tumours; second look laparoscopy, ovariectomy, laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). Advanced ovarian cancer was found in 3 patients and laparotomy was performed. No complications were established."

CD009786,0,7593516,0,The value of cyst puncture in the differential diagnosis of benign ovarian tumours.,"A prospective collection of serum samples and ovarian cyst fluid was used to assess the use of different tumour markers and cyst fluid cytology in combination with serum tumour markers for the differential diagnosis of benign ovarian cysts. A consecutive series of 108 women of median age 30 years (range 15-75) undergoing laparotomy or operative laparoscopy for presumedly benign ovarian cyst(s) were studied at a teaching hospital at the University of Milan, Italy. The main outcome measures were tumour markers CA 125, CA 19.9 and carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in serum and ovarian cyst fluid, oestradiol and progesterone concentrations in cyst fluid, and cytology of the sediment. The studied cysts were endometriotic (55 subjects), dermoid (16), mucinous (12), serous (10) or of miscellaneous histotype (15, including four follicular and one luteal). Serum CA 125 concentrations were significantly higher in the endometrioma patients than in the other groups. The sensitivity of CA 125 in the differentiation of endometriomas from other adnexal tumours was 61.8% and the specificity 94.3%; combining CA 125 and CA 19.9 assays yielded a sensitivity of 83.6% and specificity of 62.3%. Cyst fluid tumour markers values were extremely scattered with ample overlap between different cyst types. Oestradiol and progesterone concentrations were similar in the histological subgroups. Cyst fluid cytology was non-specific. We concluded that the aspiration of fluid from presumedly benign ovarian cysts appears to contribute little to the differential diagnosis of various tumours. The use of combining serum CA 125 and CA 19.9 assays in the diagnosis of endometriomas needs further confirmation."

CD009786,0,1833045,0,The use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies can lower false-negative diagnoses of peritoneal washings in ovarian tumors.,"A correct surgical staging of ovarian carcinoma and the identification of persistent microscopic disease at second-look surgery largely rely on the cytologic examination of peritoneal washings (PW). Nevertheless, the morphologic analysis of these fluids frequently provides false-negative findings. As shown in other areas of cytodiagnosis, monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to tumor-associated antigens may be a useful adjunct to overcome the limitations of conventional cytopathologic examination of PW. To evaluate this question, immunocytochemical tests were done using a panel of four MoAb to ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (B72.3, MOv18, MOv19, and OC-125) to analyze 117 PW sampled during initial surgical staging and 121 PW harvested at second-look operations. The results of this study showed that immunocytochemical tests using the combination of the four reagents could improve cytodiagnosis more than 15% in both groups of PW. Thus a significant fraction of patients could be correctly staged and treated or become potentially curable by second-line salvage therapy."

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high resolution high speed optical imaging technology which is analogous to ultrasound B-mode imaging except reflections of light are detected rather than sound. The OCT technology is capable of being integrated with laparoscopy for real-time subsurface imaging. In this report, the feasibility of OCT for differentiating normal and pathologic laparoscopically-accessible gynaecologic tissue is demonstrated. Differentiation is based on architectural changes of in vitro tissue morphology. OCT has the potential to improve conventional laparoscopy by enabling subsurface imaging near the level of histopathology."

CD009786,0,17362319,0,Characterization of an intraperitoneal ovarian cancer xenograft model in nude rats using noninvasive microPET imaging.,"MicroPET is a noninvasive imaging modality that can potentially track tumor development in nude rats using the radiotracer fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG). Our goal was to determine whether microPET, as opposed to more invasive techniques, could be used to noninvasively monitor the development of ovarian cancer in the peritoneal cavity of nude rats for monitoring treatment response in future studies. Female nude rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with 36 million NIH:OVCAR-3 cells. Imaging was carried out at 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks postinoculation. Each rat was fasted overnight and intravenously injected with 11.1 MBq (300 microCi) of (18)F-FDG in 0.2 mL of saline. Thirty minutes following injection, the rats were placed in the microPET and scanned for 30 min. After imaging, rats were euthanized for ascites and tissue collection for biodistribution and histopathologic correlation. Standard uptake values (SUVs) of (18)F-FDG within the peritoneal cavity were also calculated from regions of interest analysis of the microPET images. MicroPET images showed diffuse increased uptake of (18)F-FDG throughout the peritoneal cavity of tumor rats (mean SUV=4.64) compared with control rats (mean SUV=1.03). Ascites gathered from tumor-bearing rats had increased (18)F-FDG uptake as opposed to the peritoneal fluid collected from control rats. Biodistribution data revealed that the percent injected dose per gram (% ID/g) was significantly higher in tumor-bearing rats (6.29%) than in control rats (0.59%) in the peritoneal lymph nodes. Pathology verified that these lymph nodes were more reactive in tumor-bearing rats. By 6 weeks, some rats developed solid masses within the peritoneum, which could be detected on microPET images and confirmed as tumor by histopathology. (18)F-FDG uptake in these tumors at necropsy was 2.83% ID/g. These results correlate with previous invasive laparoscopic studies of the same tumor model and demonstrate that microPET using (18)F-FDG is a promising noninvasive tool to localize and follow tumor growth in an intraperitoneal ovarian cancer model."

Forty premenopausal non-pregnant women with a unilateral teratoma no larger than 10 cm were randomised to laparoscopy or laparotomy. Post-operative pain, duration of stay in hospital and duration of convalescence were compared. Women were reviewed every six months for five years.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with stage I ovarian cancer treated surgically between 1985 and 2001, and we included those patients with stage I epithelial cancer for whom follow-up data were available. For each patient, we recorded whether initial surgical staging was by laparoscopy or by laparotomy, the procedures done at initial staging surgery, and the outcomes. The data were evaluated by analysis of variance, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, logistic regression, Cox model, and log-rank test, using SPSS 7.5 and STATA. Initial staging was by laparoscopy in 34 patients, laparotomy in 114 patients, and laparoscopy converted to laparotomy in 30 patients. In the laparotomy group, patient age was significantly greater and tumor size significantly larger, as compared to the laparoscopy group. Staging after first surgery was often inadequate; most notably para-aortic lymph node dissection was done in 0% of laparoscopy patients, 18% of laparotomy patients, and 33% of conversion patients. Restaging surgery has been indicated in 88% of laparoscopy patients, 48% of laparotomy patients, and 46% of conversion ones. After a mean follow-up of 40 months, survival rates were not significantly different among the three patient groups. No deleterious influence of laparoscopy as first surgical access was detected by univariate or multivariate analysis. Despite of inaccurate radicality and staging during initial laparoscopy, this study found no harmful influence of laparoscopy as first initial access on outcomes of patients with stage I ovarian cancer."

CD009786,0,19745797,0,The value of laparoscopic surgery to stage gynecological cancers: present and future.,"The laparoscopic management of gynecologic cancers has been discussed controversely since decades. Much progress has been achieved technically enabling an experienced endoscopic surgeon to perform most of the gynecologic oncologic procedures such as hysterectomy, omentectomy, pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection. Although the value of laparoscopy with respect to oncological safety and patient's outcome has not been shown in prospective randomized clinical trials, many studies with altogether thousands of patients have revealed the feasibility and also similar oncologic results of laparoscopy when compared to laparotomy. Therefore, the laparoscopic approach has become well accepted for certain oncological indications, especially when early stage cancer cases are treated. These indications are also subject to ongoing Phase III trials: The LACC001 trial compares Total Laparoscopic Radical Hysterectomy (TLRH) or total robotic radical hysterectomy with total abdominal radical hysterectomy (TARH) for the treatment of early stage cervical cancer. The GOG LAP 2 and also the LACE001 trial compare total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) with total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) for the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer, whereby bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection is performed according to tumor stage and grade.

The indications were uterine fibroid (40%), adenomyosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease (36%), fibroid uterus with endometriosis (17.5%), postmenopausal bleeding (3%), ovarian neoplasm (2.1%) and fibroid uterus with ovarian cyst (1.4%). Two uterine malignancies and one case of potentially malignant ovarian neoplasm, were also encountered in our series. Assessibility score of above 20 was present in 55%. Haemorrhage was prevented intraoperatively by securing the large pedicles with electrocoagulation as well as large titanium clips (LT-400). Retrograde ureteric catheterisation was not necessary. Overall morbidity was present only in 10.62%. Intraoperative bladder injury was encountered in 1%, urinary fistula in 0.66%, primary and secondary haemorrhage in 0.33% respectively, and minor febrile morbidity in 4.66%. Conversion to conventional abdominal hysterectomy occurred in 0.66% of the cases. The average operating time was 141.99 +/- 31.678 min, the estimated blood loss was 237.07 +/- 76.76 ml and average hospitalisation was 3.37 +/- 0.66 days. The cost of laparoscopic hysterectomy was found similar to abdominal hysterectomy. Higher operating fee, operating theatre and anaesthesia charges did not affect the overall cost of laparoscopic hysterectomy because of shorter hospital stay. It is concluded that laparoscopic hysterectomy has definite role in gynaecological surgery."
CD009786,0,8924007,0,Laparoscopic port site recurrences in oncologic surgery--a review.,"The aim of this paper was to review the world's literature regarding port site recurrences. A Medline search was performed for all port site recurrences published in the literature. These reports were analysed and port site recurrences studied to determine initial stage of cancers, time to recurrence and whether the port site was an isolated site of recurrence or part of widespread intra-abdominal disease. The possible aetiologies were similarly reviewed and several recent basic science reports assessed. To date, 93 port site recurrences have been published. These have occurred with colorectal cancers as well as ovarian, gastric, pancreatic and other malignancies. Often, these recurrences are isolated and most standard means of prevention of cell dissemination may not prevent their occurrence. Possible mechanisms include aerosolisation of tumour cells, exfoliation, and changes in immune function. Port site recurrences continue to be reported. Their aetiology is unclear but the occurrence is of concern and requires continued scrutiny for laparoscopic oncologic surgery."

CD009786,0,2045855,0,A randomized trial of carboplatin versus iproplatin in untreated advanced ovarian cancer.,"Between August 1984 and October 1987, 120 patients with stage IC to IV epithelial ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin (400 mg/m2) or iproplatin (300 mg/m2) every 4 weeks as initial treatment. Stratification was made according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and according to size of residual disease after surgery. Response was evaluated after six courses when patients were restaged, with laparoscopy or laparotomy in clinical complete responders or those with no assessable disease. Treatment was then stopped in surgically proven complete responders. Patients with partial (PR) or minor response (MR) received a further six courses of their original drug at a reduced dose (carboplatin 300 mg/m2, iproplatin 225 mg/m2). Patients with stable (SD), progressive (PD), or recurrent disease were treated with cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2). The response rates were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 74%) for carboplatin and 38% (95% CI, 26% to 51%) for iproplatin. Fifteen patients were not assessable for response. The median survival was 114 weeks (95% CI, 82 to 233 weeks) for carboplatin patients and 68 weeks (95% CI, 48 to 82 weeks) for iproplatin patients (P = .008). The amount of residual disease after initial laparotomy was a prognostic factor for survival. Myelosuppression was the main toxicity and was greater with iproplatin. This study shows carboplatin to be more active than iproplatin in the treatment of ovarian cancer and less toxic. Few responses to cyclophosphamide occurred following either drug, implying resistance to the alkylating agent."

This procedure has been included in the protocol for the treatment of these tumors. During the period 1980-1987 a total of 3038 laparoscopies were performed; 205 (7%) were for ovarian cancer. We present the results of 72 explorations in 52 patients; after surgery and chemotherapy all of them were in complete remission. 44 explorations were second-look laparoscopy and 28 third-look laparoscopy. All the examinations were done under local anesthesia. There were two failures due to the presence of adhesions secondary to the previous surgery which prevented the pneumoperitoneum. In 35 (48.6%) explorations a neoplasia was found and a laparotomy was avoided. There were 31% (4/13) false negative in second-look laparotomy post-laparoscopy. The correlation between gross and microscopic findings was excellent. There were no complications in spite of the previous abdominal surgery. We recommend second-look laparoscopy in patients under treatment of ovarian cancer which in our experience avoided laparotomy almost in half of the cases; no complications were observed and the procedure was well-tolerated.

Careful preoperative evaluation is important in proper patient selection. We report a case of unexpected ovarian malignancy managed by operative laparoscopy in a 29-year-old woman. The role of ultrasonographic and laparoscopic assessment and their limitations are discussed. The potential role of intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasonographic assessment of the ovarian masses is proposed.
CD009786,0,14644836,0,Laparoscopy and oncology: where do we stand today?,"The clinical application of laparoscopic surgery has grown rapidly over the last few years. Since the first documentations of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy, many reports highlight the use of modern laparoscopy in the field of gynecologic oncology. Laparoscopic treatment of early-stage cervical and endometrial cancer, and laparoscopic evaluation and staging of cervical, ovarian, and endometrial carcinomas, are feasible procedures. The place of minimal-access surgery in the arsenal of gynecologic oncological surgery has been established, especially after the recent developments and practical application of video laparoscopy, novel instrumentation, and advanced surgical techniques. Although operative laparoscopy in gynecologic oncology is still in its infancy the potentiality of the procedure is underscored. Many patients may benefit from the treatment or staging of gynecologic malignancies with laparoscopic means. Literature reports highlight that laparoscopy may be an effective procedure with lower morbidity and complication rates than traditional abdominal surgery. The short hospital stay and recovery time have a positive impact in a cancer patient's quality of life, as they return to normal activities rapidly. Many risks, though, may arise from the application of minimal-access surgery in cancer patients, and many questions regarding safety and efficacy need answers, based on prospective clinical trials. We must emphasize that such studies with large patient numbers and long-term follow-up are lacking. Until results from these trials are available, laparoscopic oncologic procedures should be performed only in an investigational setting by expert teams."

The publications were further limited to English-language articles, those addressing adnexal mass management, early stage ovarian cancer, and advanced stage ovarian cancer treatments. The articles were divided into 4 broad categories: adnexal masses, low malignant potential tumors, early stage ovarian cancer, and advanced ovarian cancer. For each category, a further subdivision into case reports, case series, and finally cohorts was developed and summarized. Additional articles were obtained based on the bibliographic cross-reference of the initial articles reviewed. The current literature defining the role of laparoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer is limited to case reports, case series, and cohort studies. However, these limited studies suggest equal efficacy of laparoscopy compared with laparotomy in both early and advanced stage ovarian cancer."

A markedly elevated maternal serum alphafetoprotein (MSAFP) suggested a diagnosis of endodermal sinus tumour of the ovary. A right salpingo-oophorectomy at 19 weeks' gestation enabled histological confirmation of the diagnosis and suggested a stage 1 tumour. Unfortunately tumour recurrence necessitated further laparotomy and delivery by caesarean section at 32 weeks' gestation. A total abdominal hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy was undertaken with resection of the splenic flexure and formation of a double-barrelled colostomy after which no gross intraperitoneal tumour remained. Three weeks later a new suprahepatic tumour mass was excised and the colostomy was closed. The patient then received four cycles of combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Unfortunately she developed a faecal fistula at the site of the colostomy. Germ cell tumours are highly responsive to chemotherapy.

Primary retroperitoneal teratomas are extremely rare in adults. A 27-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of an incidentally found pelvic mass, considered to be an ovarian tumor by ultrasonography. Computed tomography strongly suggested a retroperitoneal cystic tumor because of anterior displacement of retroperitoneal organs. The large retroperitoneal mature teratoma was successfully resected laparoscopically without complication. In this case, despite a large tumor size and its approaching the rectum, total laparoscopic resection was the most feasible surgical choice."
CD009786,0,10541371,0,A phase II study of intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy with iodine-131-labeled monoclonal antibody OC-125 in patients with residual ovarian carcinoma.,"Standard treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Additional therapies using the i.p. route are considered as a potential means of improving the locoregional control rate. This Phase II study evaluated the efficacy of i.p. radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in patients with minimal residual ovarian adenocarcinoma after primary treatment with surgery and chemotherapy. Between February 1995 and March 1996, six patients with residual macroscopic (<5 mm) or microscopic disease as demonstrated by laparotomy and multiple biopsies received i.p. RIT. All had initial stage III epithelial carcinoma and were treated with debulking surgery and one line (four patients) or two lines (two patients) of chemotherapy. RIT was performed with 60 mg of OC 125 F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody labeled with 4.44 GBq (120 mCi) of 131I injected 5-10 days after the surgical procedure. Systematic laparoscopy or laparotomy with multiple biopsies performed 3 months after RIT in five patients (clinical progression was seen in one patient) showed no change in three patients and progression in two patients. Toxicity was mainly hematological, with grade III neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in two patients. Human antimouse antibody production was demonstrated in all six patients. This study showed little therapeutic benefit from i.p. RIT in patients with residual ovarian carcinoma."

CD009786,0,12920345,0,Miliary tuberculous peritonitis mimicking advanced ovarian cancer.,"Primary peritoneal tuberculosis is a rare presentation of this disease. It is usually associated with ascites and raised CA-125 levels. Occasionally a pelvic mass may be present making the preoperative differential diagnosis from advanced ovarian cancer extremely difficult. Acid-fast stains and special cultures of the ascitic fluid for Mycobacterium tuberculosis are frequently negative, and confirmation of the diagnosis commonly requires histologic examination of biopsy specimens, in which epithelioid granulomas with central caseous necrosis can be identified. We present a case of unexplained pyrexial ascites in a postmenopausal woman in whom the diagnosis of miliary peritoneal tuberculosis was confirmed laparoscopically. The role of noninvasive tools such as measurement of ascitic fluid adenosine deaminase levels is also discussed."

Domiciliary treatment with melphalan at the dose of 10 mg/day p.o. for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks for 12 cycles was used. Within 6 months from the end of adjuvant treatment a second restaging with peritoneoscopy and peritoneal cytology was performed. The median administered dose of melphalan was 575 mg. No patient with a borderline tumor relapsed. Nine patients with ovarian carcinoma relapsed (23%): 4/10 at stage II-III and 5/29 (17%) at stage I. The relapse-free survival at 96 months was 77% for stage I patients and 73% for all patients. The overall survival was 87% for stage I patients and 81% for all patients.

CD009786,0,17000446,0,Acute pulmonary embolism following laparoscopic ovariectomy: a case report.,"Laparoscopic surgery is usually considered to be less invasive when compared to traditional laparotomy, and is regarded as a relatively low-risk procedure for postoperative complications because of the reduced surgical stress and earlier mobilization. However, we describe a 47-year-old woman who presented with acute respiratory distress, drowsy consciousness, and circulatory collapse shortly after gynecologic laparoscopic ovariectomy for removing an ovarian teratoma at a local hospital. After resuscitation, the patient was transferred to our emergency department. Immediate bedside electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination results led to acute pulmonary embolism being quickly diagnosed. The patient received subsequent intensive care with smooth course. Although pulmonary embolism is rare after laparoscopic surgery, early detection and quick treatment are important in the management of this life-threatening complication and offer good prognosis. The risk of pulmonary embolism after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery remains unclear. Therefore, the decision to provide prophylaxis is up to the individual physician, and should take into consideration the patient's individual risk factors and comorbidities."

The goal of surgery is to remove all macroscopic tumour, as the amount of residual tumour is the most important prognostic factor for survival. When removal off all tumour is considered not feasible, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in combination with interval debulking surgery (IDS) is performed. Current methods of staging are not always accurate in predicting surgical outcome, since approximately 40% of patients will have more than 1 cm residual tumour after primary debulking surgery (PDS). In this study we aim to assess whether adding laparoscopy to the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of advanced ovarian carcinoma may prevent unsuccessful primary debulking surgery for ovarian cancer."

CD009786,0,22932780,0,Robotic surgery for gynaecologic cancer: an overview.,"After decades of reluctance to change surgical approaches, new technologies have created new perspectives for surgery. Initially, the laparoscopic approach was considered to be only one useful for relatively simple procedures as the design of the instruments and the limited access hampered free movements to perform complicated surgery. Robotic systems overcame this problem and boosted the use of minimally invasive techniques also for radical gynaecological surgery. Robot-assisted laparoscopy can now routinely be used for the surgical treatment of early or downstaged cervical carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma and staging of early ovarian carcinoma. Robot-assisted laparoscopy has proven to be feasible, although the benefits for the patient are less clear than those for the surgeon. The main advantage of robot-assisted laparoscopy over conventional laparoscopy is probably not that it is safer or better, but that it allows more types of radical surgery to be performed and that it prevents the surgeon from developing complaints and muscular conditions that interfere with the ability to perform surgery. New applications have emerged with the introduction of new devices to be used in conjunction with the robotic system as well as with totally new robotic systems. Training in these new tools should be more systematic and structured to allow their safe introduction and use."

MR findings were correlated with the results of laparoscopy (13 women) and laparotomy (17 women). Surgical examination revealed a normal pelvis in five patients and endometriosis in 25. Three of the five normal cases and 16 of the 25 cases of endometriosis were correctly identified with MR imaging (sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 60%; accuracy, 63%). MR imaging demonstrated seven of eight endometriomas but only 14 of 29 adhesions and only six of 45 endometrial implants. While MR imaging demonstrated endometriomas, ovarian adhesions, and extraperitoneal endometrial implants, it could not accurately depict extraovarian endometrial adhesions and intraperitoneal endometrial implants. In addition, MR imaging findings did not correlate with the surgically determined severity of the disease. These limitations indicate that MR imaging cannot be used as the primary modality in the detection, characterization, and staging of endometriosis; laparoscopy remains the procedure of choice."

CD009786,0,7557223,0,[Initial experiences with laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound].,"Preoperative ultrasound as well as intraoperative laparoscopic diagnosis have both their limits, a fact that might be significant for laparoscopic surgical management. In particular, since in this surgical domain, where almost everything has become technically feasible, the operator must decide what is to the benefit of the patient. A possible solution could be laparoscopic ultrasound, i.e. ultrasound diagnosis per laparoscopy at the very site of the lesion. The advantages are evident. Due to the closeness to the organ to be examined, the frequency of the scan head can be extremely high, resulting in better resolution. Also, structures could be visualized by ultrasound which e.g., due to adhesions cannot be seen with the laparoscope. Moreover, ultrasound offers a view into the structures which can be seen only from the exterior with the laparoscope. To perform these examinations we used a specially designed scanhead (Toshiba): Instead of the optical system a crystal array was inserted into a conventional gastroscope. The result was a high resolution 7.5 MHz linear array at the distal end of a freely movable gastroscope. Colour doppler sonography is feasible with this scanhead. We examined 19 patients, 16 of them with ovarian tumours, and attempted visualization of the uterine myometrium/endometrium as well as of the liver. In six cases of ovarian tumours in which only cystic structures were found by preoperative transvaginal sonography, laparoscopic ultrasound additionally revealed solid inner structures. In 5 cases direct laparoscopic view of the ovarian lesions was impossible due to severe adhesions. They were, however, easily detected by intraoperative ultrasound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009786,0,7835808,0,The role of prophylactic oophorectomy in cancer prevention.,"Prophylactic oophorectomy is presently the only effective method of ovarian cancer prevention. This study reviews current data on how prophylactic oophorectomy (PO) should be used in different risk groups. It is estimated that 7% of ovarian cancer patients have positive family history, of which 3-9% may end up having hereditary cancer syndromes. Women in direct genetic lineage of family cancer syndromes may have up to 50% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Because of such a high risk, PO is indicated for women with familial cancer syndromes after childbearing or the age of 35-40 at the latest. Most women with positive family history of ovarian cancer do not have one of the recognized hereditary cancer syndromes. However, women with one or two affected relatives do have an increased lifetime risk of ovarian cancer from a baseline of 1.6 to 5-7%. This risk is not high enough to warrant PO recommendation for a large number of women. After being properly informed and the patient still desires surgical prevention (i.e., cancer phobia), PO then becomes an indicated procedure. In women without family history of ovarian cancer, the role of PO remains controversial. The decision of PO as a concurrent procedure to other indicated gynecologic surgeries should depend on the individual patient and her ability to comply with lifelong estrogen replacement therapy."

It is a rare but a potentially dangerous issue. Its treatment may need one or more reoperations. We report here the case of a patient operated on in emergency for a torsion of an ovarian dermoid cyst, with peritoneal spillage of its content during coeliosurgery. The prolonged contact between the sebaceous material and the peritoneum has led to a chemical peritonitis. Two more laparoscopic interventions, associated with a systemic anti-inflammatory treatment, were necessary to relieve symptoms. We propose the following attitude to avoid this complication: (1) puncture and drainage of the cyst with a trocar; (2) extraction of the cyst in an endobag, and (3) abundant washout of the peritoneal cavity."

The endometriomas ranged from 2 to 9.2 cm in diameter by preoperative transvaginal ultrasonography. The operative procedure used was a three-puncture technique with a 600 micron fiber attached to a potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The power setting was 10 W with a continuous pulse. In all cases endometriomas were opened, drained, and irrigated, and the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser was used to vaporize or remove the entire cyst lining. The ovarian edges were inverted with the laser at the end of the procedure. With one exception, there was no recurrence of endometrioma at 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure, on the basis of transvaginal ultrasonography or laparoscopy. In one case, 4 months after the initial laparoscopic procedure, exploratory laparotomy was performed for resection of a large, recurrent endometrioma. The use of the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser allows the laparoscopic surgeon an aggressive approach to ovarian endometriomas that in the past necessitated exploratory laparotomy."

CD009786,0,6215076,0,[Surgery's place in the treatment of ovarian cancer].,"Surgery must remain in first place as it allows for: --biopsy by direct access, --the assessment of the peritoneal and visceral extensions, --a cytological pre-operative study of the liquid of the peritoneal lavage which might lead the surgeon to suspect otherwise unnoticed extensions--a frozen section examination of the lumbar nodes or of the other apparently normal ovary. But surgery is, above all, indispensable in order to achieve ""tumoral reduction"", as large as possible by total hysterectomy with the ablation of both annexae as well as of the epiploon. Nevertheless the surgeon is often obliged to leave cancerous centers impossible to remove and he also fails to recognize the mini-centers grafted on the peritoneum and the viscera; he therefore has an imperative need of the complementary actions of polychemo--or radiation therapy in order to sterilise or neutralize these centers. A routine ""second look"" after chemotherapy must be done even if laparoscopy is negative; this makes it possible to judge whether treatment can be discontinued; it seems capable of significantly increasing the chances of treatment in the case of a limited recurrence of a slightly developed tumor; it can make possible secondary exeresis of certain originally inoperable forms. Combined treatment and secondary controls, in particular by means of a re-intervention appear to be a serious hope of improving the results thanks, above all, to the recent contribution of chemotherapy."

CD009786,0,10194122,0,Ovarian injury and modern options to preserve fertility in female cancer patients treated with high dose radio-chemotherapy for hemato-oncological neoplasias and other cancers.,"High dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy have radically increased long term survival of young cancer patients. Among the side effects of chemotherapy treatments are ovarian failure and infertility, which are of particularly great concern to young cancer patients. Recently, cryopreservation procedures such as in vitro fertilization and embryo storage, or ovarian tissue cryopreservation have been used to preserve fertility in patients subjected to cancer treatments. Knowledge of the risks and probabilities of ovarian failure as well as the risks of the cryopreservation procedures is crucial for patients and physicians in order to make informed choices that will best serve the patients interests. This article presents data of a prospective study that determines the risk of ovarian failure following exposure to chemotherapy as well as a review of related publications. Progressive, dose-related depletion of primordial follicles is noted on histology, explaining the risk of undergoing premature ovarian failure years after exposure to chemotherapy. The safety of ovarian tissue cryopreservation procedures with a new round biopter was evaluated, as well as the risk of malignant cell transmission. It has been shown that laproscopic ovarian biopsy performed with the round biopter is a safe and efficient method for collection of ovarian tissue in cancer patients. In Hodgkin's disease patients' ovarian cortical tissue obtained for cryopreservation does not contain malignant cells. However the risk of cryopreserving and transferring malignant cells should be tested separately for each disease according to the risk of ovarian metastasis and the ability to detect single malignant cells."
CD009786,0,10469692,0,Factors that increase the risk of leakage during surgical removal of benign cystic teratomas.,"The contents of mature cystic teratomas can be a potent irritant resulting in chemical peritonitis. Using a retrospective cohort, we examined the various risk factors for leakage of benign cystic teratomas during laparoscopy and laparotomy. Cyst leakage of the benign cystic teratoma contents was the primary endpoint. In all, 158 women underwent surgery for a total of 178 ovarian benign cystic teratomas. Statistical analysis was performed using chi(2), Mann-Whitney U and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 115 benign cystic teratomas was successfully removed without intra-operative leakage and 63 underwent intra-operative leakage either at laparoscopy or laparotomy. The likelihood of success of removing the benign cystic teratoma intact was unrelated to age, pre-operative size or surgical technique. There was no difference among cystectomies performed by laparotomy in surgeon experience or the presence of adhesions. However, surgeons with more laparoscopic experience (>35 laparoscopies/year) were less likely to have intra-operative leakage (relative risk: 0.5, 95% confidence interval: 0.2, 1.2) compared to surgeons with less experience (<20/year) at cystectomy (26.1 versus 51.2% respectively). Oophorectomy significantly reduced the frequency of intra-operative leakage at both laparoscopy and laparotomy (14.7%). These findings suggest that laparoscopic experience can reduce the risk of leakage at cystectomy. At laparotomy, lack of surgeon postgraduate years of experience was not a risk factor for leakage."

CD009786,0,10646238,0,Minimally invasive surgery in the field of gynecologic oncology.,"The aim of this paper was to present the results in minimal invasive surgery in the field of gynecologic oncology at General hospital Zabok, Croatia. 381 laparoscopic procedures were performed between 1994 and 1998. There were 263 operations of the benign adnexal masses, and 107 operations due to benign tumors of corpus uteri (there were 18 LAVH, 12 LH and 77 TLH). There were 11 laparoscopic operations due to carcinoma (1 ovary, 6 corpus and 4 cervix). Operations were: 3 LAVH (laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy), 5 TLH (total laparoscopic hysterectomy) with pelvic lymphadenectomy, 1 LAVH with pelvic lymphadenectomy, 1 coelio Shauta operation with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy and paraaortal lymphadenectomy, and 1 laparoscopic adnexectomy. Among laparoscopic procedures in 370 patients operations were successfully performed as planed, while in 11 patients it was necessary to switch to laprotomy. Among serious complications of laparscopic operations it is necessary to note 2 lesions of the ureter and 1 lesion of the bladder. Laparoscopic lymphadenectomies were performed successfully; there were no serious early or late postoperative complications. There was no operative mortality. Even though many authors claim that laparoscopic operations in the field of gynecologic oncology are safe and have the same results as in open surgery, patients benefit from shorter recovery and better quality of life during laparoscopic procedures."

A total of 130 young and premenopausal women scheduled for surgery for an adnexal mass with a diameter of 5-10 cm underwent transvaginal ultrasound (US) examination prior to surgery. Laparoscopic management was successfully completed for 118 of the 130 patients in this study; however, 12 required conversion of laparoscopy to laparotomy due to endometriosis with extensive bowel adhesions, or suspected ovarian malignancy and peritoneal implants. One hundred and twenty-four patients (95.38%) had benign lesions, four (3.07%) had borderline tumors and two patients had malignant lesions (1.53%).

CD009786,0,17948753,0,[Benign and borderline tumors of the ovary].,"Alterations of the ovaries easily cause diagnostic uncertainty about relevance and consequence. Palpable or sonographic ovarian tumors are reason for various differential diagnoses. Therefore the clarification of ovarian lesions is one of the main duties in daily gynaecological practice. Although diagnostic procedures might be supplemented by CT-Scan or MRI techniques, classical bimanual examination and vaginal ultrasound scan will determine the diagnosis in most cases comparably accurate. The suspected diagnosis concerning benign or malignant lesions, should take the palpable and sonographic feature, as well as the information from the patients medical history (e.g. family history of malignant diseases (BRCA 1/2 mutations) into account. In this regard, there are no other additional parameters established. Serum tumormarkers (CA 12.5) or sonographic examinations (including Doppler) have low sensitivity and specificity. Clinical diagnostic experience seems to be crucial. Cystic lesions mostly occur in premenopausal women and commonly relapse. They are mostly normal follicle cysts, but may also be a tumor of low malignant potential (LMP-tumor) or even an invasive cancerous lesion. 20-30% of all ovarian tumors are malignant and by the time of primary diagnosis already in a about 60-70% incurable due to intraabdominal dissemination. Benign or malignant lesions may occur in every age group. Ovarian tumors at infantile age are malignant in about 15%. Most malignant tumors occur between the age of 50 to 70. The LMP-tumors occur in average 10 years earlier. Malignant ovarian lesions represent about 15-30% of all genital malignant tumors. Hormonal contraceptives, pregnancy and breast feeding seem to be protective. The persistence of ovarian cysts and tumors will be mostly examined by laparoscopic surgery. In that respect the diagnosis of LMP-tumors might be incidentally and will then have a substantial impact on the extent of the surgery and the follow up. This compilation overviews the spectrum of benign and low malignant potential tumors of the ovary and their different tissues of origin."

In early-stage cervical cancer during the first and at the beginning of the second trimester, the two main considerations for management of the patient are the tumour size (and stage) and nodal staging. MRI and laparoscopic lymphadenectomy are useful for clinicians planning a potentially conservative approach. The management of patients with locally advanced cervical disease is controversial and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis according to the tumour size, radiological findings, the term of pregnancy, and the patient's wishes. Different histological types of malignant ovarian diseases arise during pregnancy and their management depends on the diagnosis (histological subtypes, tumour differentiation, and nodal status), the tumour stage, and the trimester of the pregnancy. In patients with peritoneal spread or high-risk early-stage disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with pregnancy preservation could be appropriate."
CD009786,0,8187587,0,Transvaginal sonographic characterization combined with cytologic evaluation in the diagnosis of ovarian and adnexal cysts.,"A transvaginal sonographic (TVS) scoring system using morphologic features has been developed at our institution to maximize discrimination between benign and malignant ovarian and adnexal cysts. Low (4-7) or intermediate (8-9) scores have been found to correlate with benignity, hence TVS-guided or laparoscopically directed needle aspiration of low-scoring lesions may safely be performed. High-scoring lesions (10-14) are often malignant, therefore in situ needle aspiration of such lesions is not recommended. The aim of our study was to correlate the results of TVS characterization of ovarian and adnexal cysts with the aspiration cytologic evaluation. Twenty-three of the 43 cysts studied were aspirated in situ from the patient; 20 were aspirated from resected surgical specimens. Thirty-six benign cysts had TVS scores ranging from 4 to 12, with a median score of 7. All 25 cysts that were benign by TVS and/or histology were also cytologically benign as well as an additional 11 cysts that were not resected (TVS scores: 4 to 9). Seven cytologically and histologically malignant cysts had high TVS scores (TVS scores 10-14; median = 12). The combination of TVS and needle aspiration cytology is valuable, particularly in the diagnosis of cysts having low or intermediate TVS scores and benign cytology. Aspiration of cysts or masses with high TVS scores is not recommended. This combined evaluation may allow a more limited surgical approach, such as operative laparoscopy, or, in some cases, obviate the need for operative treatment altogether."

The pelviscopic procedures were primarily organ preserving operations associated with minimally invasive surgery, for example: Ovariolysis, ovarian cyst enucleation, coagulation of ovarian endometriotic implants, follicle puncture, parovarian cyst enucleation and, salpingo-oophorectomy. Laparotomy was indicated in the case of malignant disease, borderline tumors, large tumors, extensive adhesiolysis status post previous laparotomy, and in one case uncontrollable bleeding.

CD009786,0,8821245,0,The role of laparoscopic surgery in gynaecological oncology.,"Minimal access surgery is here to stay in gynaecological oncology. Within the last three years, rapid strides have been made in applying minimal access surgical techniques to a wide range of gynaecological oncology procedures. The re-assessment of radical vaginal surgery has come largely because of the ease of accessing the pelvic lymph nodes using retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal techniques. An ability to assess the lymph nodes of the pelvis and the para-aortic region prior to definitive therapy is making management of many oncological conditions more logical. Question marks still arise over the place of minimal access surgery in ovarian cancer. A recent study by Professor Gunther Kinderman (Munich) in which, following a postal questionnaire, he identified an unacceptably high rate of laparoscopic interventions in invasive cancer with a parallel unacceptably high rate of metastatic disease, particularly in the port sites, has demonstrated a need for constant vigilance and careful assessment of the application of minimal access surgery in certain areas of oncology. Even while this chapter was in press, Professor Daniel Dargent has shown the possibility of carrying out assessment laparoscopically of the groin lymph nodes using a combination of minimal access surgery and plastic surgical techniques to remove fat. This technique when applied to sentinel node identification may revolutionize our assessment of the groin. Clearly this is an exciting time in gynaecological oncology and many and new inventive applications are being visualized by surgeons throughout the world.

CD009786,0,8821246,0,Laparoscopic pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy.,"A systematic approach to the laparoscopic management of gynaecological malignancies began about 5 years ago more or less simultaneously in a few centres in France and the USA. Mature data and long-term follow-up are not yet available. Despite the absence of comparative studies, evidence is, in this author's opinion, now compelling that pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy can be carried out just as effectively laparoscopically as via a laparotomy. This conclusion is based on traditional surgical, anatomical and pathological considerations such as the way in which the operation is executed, photodocumentation of the extensiveness of the dissection, the lymph node harvest and the proportion of positive lymph nodes recovered. The benefits of a laparoscopic approach have yet to be demonstrated in comparative studies, but compared with historical controls, the reduction in morbidity is so dramatic as to leave little doubt that patients benefit from laparoscopic treatment in experienced hands."

CD009786,0,10459063,0,Laparoscopic management of benign ovarian disease.,"There was little controversy in the management of ovarian cysts until 15 years ago when operative endoscopy gained popularity. Before this time, laparotomy was the standard form of treatment for pelvic masses. Simple cysts were treated laproscopically by aspiration and solid or large tumors with any malignant potential by laparotomy. Constantly improving technology and instrumentation has allowed more and more operations to be performed laparoscopically. The gynecological oncologist has been wary of adopting this form of surgery for potential gynecological malignancies because of the safety and efficacy issues. Pelvic pathology, particularly ovarian tumors, pose a difficult problem. Apart from difficulty in screening, it is also difficult to confirm the nature of an ovarian pathology using the currently available investigative modalities. If the nature of an ovarian cyst can be ascertained beyond doubt, then the treatment can be simple, laparoscopy for benign and laparotomy for malignant. Having said that, more enthusiastic operative laparoscopists are using this approach to treat gynecological malignancies. We discuss the role of laparoscopy in the management of ovarian cysts."

Epithelial cancer of the ovary was only 25% as common among those who had ever taken oral contraceptives as those who had never done so (95% confidence interval 8% to 67%). There was little evidence of any important association between use of oral contraceptives and benign teratoma or cystadenoma. Functional cysts of the ovary occurred much less commonly in women who had recently (in the six months preceding diagnosis) taken combined oral contraceptives (but not in those who had taken progestogen only oral contraceptives) than in those who had never taken oral contraceptives or had taken them in the past. This protective effect was more pronounced for corpus luteum cysts (78% reduction; 95% confidence interval 47% to 93%) than for follicular cysts (49% reduction; 95% confidence interval 20% to 70%). It is estimated that about 28 (95% confidence interval 16 to 35) operations for functional ovarian cysts are avoided among every 100,000 women who take oral contraceptives each year."
CD009786,0,8747403,0,Office laparoscopy as a screening tool for early detection of ovarian cancer.,"Laparoscopy is a safe and effective surgical procedures used in evaluating the peritoneal cavity. Laparoscopy, under local anesthesia, has been well documented in the literature. These studies support the concept that laparoscopy can be performed under local anesthesia. Several small studies have addressed the respiratory, cardiac, and hemodynamic changes observed using local anesthesia and suggest that, with proper monitoring, these procedures can be safely performed in an outpatient setting. Optical catheter systems now have diameters ranging from 0.25 mm to 2.5 cm. Image fibers 6 microns in diameter are combined in bundles. The catheter system produces a brighter though grainier picture than views produced by a xenon light source and a 5 mm laparoscope. An Adair Verres needle (18 gauge) is inserted through a 3 mm plastic introducer. The Adair Verres needle is removed and a gas extension tube is used to create a pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide. The optical catheter is placed through the extension tube. If a second site is required for biopsy or washings, a 3 mm port can be inserted under direct visualization. Miniature ultrasound transducers have now been developed as a means of imaging the internal structures of the ovary. These transducers, housed in #3.5-6.2 French catheters, can be passed through a laparoscope, adding a new dimension to laparoscopy. Although the technology of office laparoscopy as a means of detecting early ovarian cancer exists, it has limited applicability for screening the population at large. It may be more useful as secondary or tertiary testing in the work-up of patients suspected of having ovarian cancer."

The treatment is surgical, but this may increase the risk of pregnancy loss in the first trimester. The use of laparoscopic surgery, which is less invasive than traditional laparotomy, has been limited by diagnostic and technical difficulties including determination of ovarian tumor nature and spillage of cyst contents intraoperatively. A 25-year-old woman in her 11th week of pregnancy had acute severe left lower-abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as left ovarian teratoma with torsion. She underwent emergency laparoscopic surgery with unwinding of the twisted fallopian tube and ovary and cystectomy of the teratoma.

The most common of these tumors--serous papillary carcinoma--is generally asymptomatic in the early stages. Non serous carcinomas (endometrioid and clear-cell carcinomas) have a higher chance of early diagnosis, as the associated endometriosis can cause pelvic pain, while endometrial hyperplasia/neoplasia can lead to vaginal bleeding. In addition, serous papillary carcinomas tend to be bilateral with peritoneal involvement, while non serous papillary carcinomas are often unilateral. Non serous papillary carcinomas tend to occur in younger, hyperestrogenic, often infertile patients. Serous papillary carcinomas potentially arise from dysplastic epithelial cells lining the ovarian surface and inclusion cysts, while the substrate of non serous papillary tumors is atypical endometriotic tissue. Tumor markers also tend to differ between the two forms of ovarian cancer.

Transvaginal sonography is major means for diagnosing ovarian In our study, we scanned 60 patients with endometriomata who underwent laparotomy or laparoscopy. We compared preoperative ultrasonographic diagnosis with histological reports. The sonographic criteria for the diagnosis of endometriomata were (1) cystic structure with low, homogeneous echogenicity and (2) thick cystic wall with regular margins. In 50 patients, sonography suggested an endometrioma. In 47 cases, the diagnosis was correct. The false-positive cases were all caused by cystic teratomas with a homogeneous sonographic pattern. Ten false-negative cases were diagnosed by ultra-sonography as functional ovarian cysts (5), teratomas (3), and benign ovarian cystoma (1). Only 1 case of a 5-mm endometrioma was demonstrated by laparoscopy but not by TVS. The sensitivity of TVS for diagnosing endometriomata was 82.4% and specificity 97.7%; the positive and negative predictive values were 94% and 92.8%, respectively.

In gynecology, an overall accuracy of 94.5% in the differentiation between benign and malignant tumors has been reported. Despite many controversial views regarding its safety, aspiration cytology has been accepted as an innocuous procedure that can be accomplished with minimal discomfort or complications and, in association with laparoscopy, assist in the management of ovarian cysts and masses. Although FNA cannot be considered the first-hand diagnostic procedure for ovarian cancer in postmenopausal patients, it may be extremely helpful in young women, even during pregnancy, to safely differentiate functional and other benign ovarian cysts from malignant ones. In postmenopausal women, especially those in the high risk group for surgical procedures and those undergoing a ""second look"" intervention following radiation or chemotherapy, aspiration cytology may provide sufficient information to warrant abandoning unnecessary surgery. During laparotomy for suspected unilateral disease, FNA may provide sufficient data about the opposite ovary to allow that organ to remain in place, thus preserving its function in a young patient. The pathologist must be familiar with the cytology of normal pelvic structures and the diagnostic criteria used to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, as well as potential diagnostic pitfalls, such as interpretation based on very few cells or the absence of appropriate clinical information. Although proper classification of ovarian masses can be achieved through FNA, the pathologist should be aware of its limitations, such as difficulties in differentiating adenomas from non-neoplastic cysts, and tumors of low malignant potential from well-differentiated carcinomas. Descriptive histologic terminology should be applied, and terms such as ""suspicious"" or ""atypical"" avoided. The aspirated material may not only be used for the diagnosis and classification of ovarian neoplasms, it may also be used for DNA analysis, detection of estrogen receptors and other prognostic markers, thus providing information regarding biologic behavior of the tumors. Finally, it is hoped that aspiration of ovarian lesions routinely detected by sonography, in elderly women or those with a strong family history of ovarian cancer, will allow the physician to accomplish detection of early ovarian cancer."

CD009786,0,8849961,0,Current status of staging laparotomy in colorectal and ovarian cancer.,"Colon and rectal carcinomas. Accurate staging of colon and rectal carcinomas (CRCs) is vital to insure appropriate surgical and adjuvant therapy, and appropriate enrollment in and interpretation of adjuvant or neoadjuvant trials. Historically, CRC staging has relied on pathologic examination of surgical speciments. These newer techniques of endoscopic and intraoperative ultrasound, laparoscopy, and radioimmunoguided surgery may permit increased accuracy of staging by the surgeon. Cautious interpretation of investigations of these modalities is warranted, as studies include small numbers of patients and some of the work is preliminary. Despite this, we remain optimistic that as surgeons become more familiar with these techniques and as these modalities become more widely available, more accurate staging will facilitate optimal patient management in terms of complete resection of occult disease and appropriate adjuvant therapy. Ovarian carcinoma. The survival of patients with ovarian cancer has not appreciably changed in the past several decades. There are several reasons for this, some of which are related to the surgical procedures used to diagnose and treat these cancers. First, despite a great deal of literature that suggests an elevated CA-125 level in a postmenopausal woman with a pelvic mass is virtually diagnostic of ovarian carcinoma, an unexceptably large number of patients are still explored in community hospitals by a surgeon or obstetrician-gynecologist who is not prepared or adequately trained to perform the aggressive cytoreductive surgery that the patients require. Similarly, a large percentage of patients with ""apparent"" early ovarian cancer are not fully surgically staged at their initial surgery and often require reoperation to accurately define the extent of their disease, which will then determine the need for adjuvant therapy. Despite ongoing health care reforms, these patients should be referred to centers where the appropriate surgical procedure can be performed by an experienced gynecologic oncologist. Second-look laparotomy (SLL) has become more and more controversial, mainly because of a lack of effective second-line therapy, and should not be performed unless the patient fully understands its limitations and is willing preoperatively to participate in a subsequent trial based on the operative findings. Laparoscopy, both in the initial staging surgery and at reassessment laparotomy (SLL), is being re-evaluated but should be considered experimental until definitive trials determine its role."

CD009786,0,18614547,0,NOTES: transvaginal for cancer diagnostic staging: preliminary clinical application.,"Laparoscopy is now a reliable method for staging gastrointestinal cancer, orienting the therapy, and avoiding unnecessary laparotomy. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is an emerging concept with potential advantages for patient recovery. The first case of clinical diagnostic application of transvaginal NOTES for diagnostic cancer staging is presented. Informed consent and Institutional Commission approval were obtained for transvaginal clinical trials. On February 28, 2007, a patient with elective surgical indication for diagnostic cancer staging was submitted to transvaginal NOTES procedure, and intra- and postoperative parameters were documented. In a 50-year-old female patient presenting with ascitis, diffuse abdominal pain, and weight loss for 2 months, diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis was suspected, which was also found when a CT scan was performed. Transvaginal NOTES was used for diagnostic staging of the patient, using a colonoscope introduced into the abdomen through a small incision in the vagina. Biopsies of liver, diaphragm, ovaries, and peritoneum were successfully performed. Operative time was 105 min, vaginal access and closure was obtained in 15 min. Abdominal inventory was reliable, and all 16 biopsies taken were positive for ovarian adenocarcinoma. The patient was dismissed 48 hours after the procedure without complications. Recent literature and experience of the study group suggest possibilities for preliminary clinical applications by transvaginal natural orifice surgery for diagnostic purposes."

CD009786,0,15516851,0,Peritoneal carcinoma in women with genetic susceptibility: implications for Jewish populations.,"Women from families with multiple cases of breast and ovarian cancer, specifically those who carry cancer-associated mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 are at increased life-time risk for peritoneal carcinoma, even after previous surgery to remove the ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus. Hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and the associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are particularly prevalent in women of Jewish lineage, and specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations have been linked with peritoneal carcinoma and HBOC syndrome in Jewish populations, especially those of Ashkenazi descent. This review presents the currently available data and looks forward toward further and better understanding of peritoneal carcinoma in women with inherited susceptibility. Over 90% of peritoneal cancer in patients from HBOC syndrome kindreds and associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are serous carcinomas, which is equivalent with the proportion of ovarian cancers that are serous carcinomas in similar patients. The best indications are that while many peritoneal carcinomas in genetically susceptible women may arise directly from malignant transformation of the peritoneum, others might represent metastases from primary ovarian or fallopian tube carcinomas. Although the incidence of borderline ovarian tumors may not be increased in HBOC syndrome kindreds and those who carry cancer-associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, these individuals could be susceptible to malignant transformation of borderline lesions of the ovaries and peritoneum. Moreover, recent reports raise the question of possibly increased risk in Jewish carriers of germline BRCA1 mutations for uterine papillary serous carcinoma, which could be the source of metastasis to the peritoneum in some cases. The penetrance of cancer-associated BRCA1 mutations for ovarian cancer is estimated to be 11%-54%, and for BRCA2 mutations the penetrance for ovarian cancer is 11%-23%. So far, available screening methods appear to be insufficient for early detection of many ovarian cancers. Prophylactic oophorectomy has been found to reduce the risk for ovarian cancer in women from HBOC kindreds and those who carry cancer-associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, leaving a residual risk for peritoneal carcinomatosis of well less than 5%. Therefore, surgical removal of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus, after child-bearing has been completed and by early in the fifth decade of life, are appropriate prophylactic procedures in women whose genetic susceptibility puts them at increased risk for cancers of mullerian tract origin, including ovarian and fallopian tube carcinomas and possibly serous carcinoma of the uterus. Hysterectomy, as well as salpingo-oophorectomy, removes the gynecologic organs targeted for malignant transformation in genetically susceptible women and simplifies decisions regarding hormone replacement therapy and chemical prophylaxis and treatment of breast cancer. Unless a transabdominal operative approach is otherwise indicated, laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal techniques are well suited for intra-abdominal exploration, cytology, biopsies and prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy in women with hereditary susceptibility to gynecologic cancer."
CD009786,0,17217498,0,Inguinal endometriosis attaching to the round ligament.,"We report a case of endometriosis in the right inguinal region, attached to the right round ligament in a 28-year-old woman. At the age of 20, laparoscopic left ovarian cystectomy and pelvic adhesiolysis for endometriosis was carried out. She noticed a right tender groin mass 7 months previously, and the tumour size fluctuated with the menstrual cycle. A poorly circumscribed elastic hard mass, measuring 3 cm in diameter, was palpated in her right inguinal region. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm mass in the right inguinal canal and a 5.4 cm x 6.8 cm mass was seen in the left ovary. The mass enlarged during menstruation. The groin mass was removed, in addition to carrying out laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. At operation, the groin mass was found to be in continuity with the round ligament of extraperitoneal portion. Histological diagnosis of endometriosis was made in both ovarian and inguinal tumours. After surgery, the pain disappeared completely. Worth mentioning is that MRI clearly showed the change of tumour size depending on the menstrual cycle, which aided in arriving at the correct diagnosis of endometriosis in an unusual location."

Owing to its high predictive value, laparoscopic surgery should be recommended for comprehensive diagnosis of small-size masses located in the small pelvis as possible early precursors of ovarian tumor; morphological verification of tumor process extent, and detection of preclinical recurrence of tumor in cases of failed non-invasive monitoring procedures such as ultrasound and CA-125 determination."

This has special relevance to the increasing possibilities of conservative management of adnexal tumours and cysts (puncturing or operating by laparoscopy). We reviewed sonographical and histological data of 514 patients, who were operated on in the 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Vienna because of pelvic masses. We correlated sonographical parameters like size of tumour, distinctness of margins, different kinds of internal echo pattern, papillary vegetation on the cystic wall or septa, with the defined histopathological diagnosis. A close relationship between size of tumour and tumour status could be found. The size of benign tumours was 7.1 cm. Malignant tumours had a size of 10.7 cm. The size of the high-echogenic area within the tumour, as well as its homogeneity, seemed to be of great importance. Such tumours with high-echogenic areas within, and especially those who had nonhomogeneous structures of these areas, proved to be malignant in 81% of the cases. Similarly, we found a close correlation of papillary vegetation either on cystic walls or on septa with the confirmed diagnosis of malignancy. Septa without papillarities or changing of their thickness were less important. By means of using our criteria a less experienced sonographic examiner could reach as good results as an experienced one in predicting malignancy."

CD009786,0,8736725,0,Sterilization.,"Sterilization is accepted as a permanent method of contraception by many couples in the world. Female sterilization is more widely used than male sterilization, but the latter is used by many couples in developed countries. The most widely used methods for female sterilization are simple tubal ligation, electrocautery of the fallopian tubes, and occlusion of the tubes by Hulka or Filshie clips or Falope rings. These procedures may be carried out either by minilaparotomy or by laparoscopy, under local anaesthesia. Sterilization may be performed immediately following pregnancy, or as an interval operation. The effectiveness of female sterilization is high, with failure rates of about 1-2 per 1000 procedures. Immediate complications are few and minor, while there appear to be no serious, long-term adverse effects. It is possible that there is a protective effect against ovarian cancer. Potential new technologies for female sterilization include the use of chemicals, such as quinacrine, for transcervical tubal occlusion, and hysteroscopic methods. Male sterilization is more simple and can readily be performed under local anaesthesia. A new technique originating in China, the no-scalpel technique, has made the procedure even more simple and produces fewer complications such as haematoma. It is possible that the direct injection of plug-forming material into the vas may render the procedure more reversible. Concerns about possible adverse effects of vasectomy on cardiovascular diseases and testicular cancer largely have been dispelled, but a possible weak association between vasectomy and prostatic cancer continues to be studied."

Biopsy did not reveal the diagnosis. After laparoscopic examination, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Pathology showed atypical myeloid cells infiltrating the muscle bundles which was consistent with granulocytic sarcoma involving the uterus and right fallopian tube. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis. The patient is in complete remission for AML and being followed-up for granulocytic sarcoma. Granulocytic sarcoma of the uterus and fallopian tube is very rare, and in AML patients with abnormal uterine bleeding but negative endometrial biopsy it should still be considered in the differential diagnosis."
CD009786,0,8641614,0,A phase I study of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide in recurrent adenocarcinoma of the ovary.,"We have conducted a disease specific phase I study of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide in recurrent adenocarcinoma of the ovary. This was done to take advantage of the cellular and molecular synergism between paclitaxel and DNA-damaging agents, with the hope of avoiding paclitaxel-cisplatin toxicities. Paclitaxel was given as a 24-hr CIVI, after which cyclophosphamide was given as a 60-min infusion. Cycles of therapy were repeated every 3 weeks; and granulocyte colony-simulating factor (G-CSF) was given in a ""flexible"" dosing fashion. Starting doses were 170 mg/m2 paclitaxel and 750 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was seen at the doses of 250 mg/m2 paclitaxel and 1250 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide. DLT was cumulative thrombocytopenia. There were six nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicities experienced in the study. Eleven of 20 evaluable patients (55%) have achieved an objective response (4 CCR;7 PR). Three of four CCRs were confirmed by negative findings at peritoneoscopy. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1-4) and 17 individuals had platinum-refractory disease. We conclude that paclitaxel followed by cyclophosphamide is an active combination in recurrent ovarian cancer and that further study is needed to determine if this combination is truly better than paclitaxel alone."

CD009786,0,11155944,0,Reproduction post-chemotherapy in young cancer patients.,"High-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy has increased long-term survival of young patients with cancer. Sometimes however, the price paid is ovarian failure and sterility. It is highly important to detect who are the patients at risk in order to verify when fertility preservation is indicated. With conventional chemotherapy, there is significant differences in ovarian failure rate according to patients age, disease for which patients are treated for, and the drugs used. Bone marrow transplantation in cancer patients almost invariably induced ovarian failure, irrespective of patient age, treatment protocol or administration of hormonal treatment. Moreover, normal reproductive parameters post-chemotherapy does not necessarily imply that the ovaries escaped damage; ovarian injury is not an all or none phenomenon--partial loss of primordial follicle reserve can result in premature menopause as a delayed reaction to treatment. This should be taken into account while consulting former cancer patients about future planed pregnancies. The direct mechanisms of chemotherapy induced ovarian failure are poorly understood. An in vitro study has demonstrated that in the human ovary chemotherapy acts primarily on primordial follicles through induction of apoptotic changes in pregranulosa cells which lead to follicle loss. Protecting fertility potential in females exposed to chemotherapy with IVF and embryo cryopreservation or cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is practiced. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation: A recent study has demonstrated that laparoscopic ovarian biopsy performed with the round biopter is a safe and efficient method for collecting ovarian tissue for cryopreservation in cancer patients. In order to avoid possible hazards of transferring malignant cells, genetic and immunohistochemical markers for detection of minimal residual cancer cells in ovarian tissue are currently used. However, the reproductive potential of this method is still questionable. IVF: IVF and embryocryopreservation is currently used in infertile patients, however, several obstacles prevent it's wide implementation in cancer patients such as the need for male partner and the time needed for ovarian stimulation. A highly important issue is the possible risk of performing IVF and embryo cryopreservation to preserve fertility in females already exposed to chemotherapy. An animal study has raised serious concerns regarding the consequences of chemotherapy on future pregnancies. High abortion and malformation rates related to the different stages of oocyte maturation at the time of exposure to chemotherapy were demonstrated. These results should be taken into account when considering the use of IVF and embryo cryopreservation following chemotherapy treatment in cancer patients."

CD009786,0,21158324,0,Handling ovarian cancer FIGO III-IV : evolution over the last 30 years.,"The treatment of ovarian cancer FIGO III-IV has undergone substantial changes in the last 30 years. As I was involved as an oncological surgeon in the treatment of these patients since 1979 and made my PhD thesis on this subject, I consider myself a privileged witness of this evolution. In the late 1970's two major changes took place: the introduction of combination chemotherapy containing cisplatin and the concept of debulking surgery. In 1980 we embarked on an ambitious treatment plan combining maximal cytoreductive surgery, 6 cycles of chemotherapy, second look laparotomy and panabdominal irradiation. The results were analyzed in 1991 and gave rise to the following changes. Surgical cytoreduction could only be considered optimal if no residual tumor was left and residual tumor correlated with median survival. Upfront surgery was abandoned in FIGO IV and FIGO III with a very high tumor load. Panabdominal irradiation was too toxic. A recent randomized study has established equivalency of survival in FIGO IIIc between interval debulking after 3 cycles and upfront surgery. Initial tumor load remains a determinant of long- term cure and optimal upfront surgery is critical in patients with a metastatic tumor load of less than 100 gram. Retroperitoneal node dissection becomes important when complete resection of peritoneal metastases can be obtained. In experienced hands selection for primary debulking or for interval debulking seems possible at laparoscopic exploration."

Interval debulking surgery, a newer treatment modality, appears to have a promising role for patients who cannot be adequately debulked at their initial surgery.

Motion artifacts were reduced on breath-hold FR-FSE (3.8:3.2 = breath-hold FSE:nonbreath-hold FSE, P < 0.01) and image quality was comparable (3.8:3.7, NS). In all patients, pathology (leiomyoma [N = 26], adenomyosis [N = 10], endometrial carcinoma [N = 8], and ovarian cystic lesions [N = 21]) was recognized with comparable lesion conspicuity (3.8:3.7, NS) and better delineation of the structures (3.9:3.6, P < 0.05) on the FR-FSE images.

Hirsutism and related symptoms are most often caused by excess androgens of ovarian and/or adrenal origin, i.e. testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, delta 4-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulphate. As demonstrated by selective catheterization of glandular effluents, combined hypersecretion occurs more frequently then either purely gonadal or adrenal overproduction. No correlation can be found between the type, frequency and extent of hormonal changes and the clinical, laparoscopic, angiographic, or histological findings. Dynamic function tests do not reliably discriminate between the various aetiological subgroups due to extremely variable and even non-specific individual responsiveness. Selective catheterization is presently the most sensitive method for the preoperative identification and localization of androgen-secreting neoplasms."
CD009786,0,15064540,0,[Surgical treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer].,Primary cytoreductive surgery remains the standard care in advanced ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery is defined as a residual tumor load less than 1 cm. after operation. The randomized clinical trials showed that interval debulking surgery improved survival in patients who did not undergo optimal primary debulking surgery. The retrospective trials have suggested that the outcome for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is the same as for patients treated with primary debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy should not to be used for clinical practice until the randomized clinical trial carried out by Gynecological Cancer Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and National Cancer Institute of Canada answers this question. There are no data from randomized trials to show the survival advantage in patients who received second-look operation as compared to those who did not.

We report a case of a 54-year-old woman with amenorrhea and hirsutism of abrupt onset and mild signs of virilization that had an adrenal incidentaloma coexisting with ovarian hyperthecosis. Basal total and free testosterone were 191 ng/dL and 179 pmol/L. Pelvic ultrasonography disclosed a right ovary with 10.3 cc and a left ovary with 9.8 cc without nodules or cysts, and computerized tomography of the abdomen disclosed a normal right adrenal gland. On the left adrenal gland a solid nodule with 0.8 cm was seen. After GnRHa administration, total testosterone was 23 ng/dL and free testosterone was 17 pmol/L. In view of a suppression of testosterone by GnRHa, the patient was submitted to a hystero-oophorectomy by laparoscopy. Symmetrically enlarged ovaries were seen. No tumor was apparent. Histology showed hyperthecosis, with foci of luteinized stromal cells. Only atretic follicles were detected. No hilar cell hyperplasia was seen. In conclusion, the presence of an adrenal mass in a hirsute woman can lead to a wrong diagnosis. In this case the suppression GnRHa test was fundamental to determine the origin of hyperandrogenemia."

All these uses of TVUS of the ovary will be discussed in this article."
CD009786,0,161766,0,"[The evolution of the indications for laparoscopy between 1973 and 1977. 1,758 cases (author's transl)].","In order to avoid the misuse of laparoscopy by an unnecessary increase in the indications for the procedure the authors have reviewed the evolution of these indications in the five years between 1973 and 1977. Certain indications have stayed stable, such as chronic pain in the pelvis, masses found in the pelvis, symptoms suggestive of upper genital tract infection or of ectopic pregnancy and tubal or unexplained sterility. Stability in these indications is correct because laparoscopy and laparoscopy alone can give a precise diagnosis of the lesion and complete the clinical findings and the other methods of investigation. There are two indications which have become less frequent and these are: ovarian sterility and amenorrhoea. This is logical since more reliance has come to be placed on biological methods. Laparoscopy should be reserved in these conditions for cases where are contradictions between biological findings or where there are therapeutic failures. An increase in the indications which is very justified is in those laparoscopies which are carried out as a control of the results of tubal surgery, because there a prognosis can be given and therapy can be carried out (such as division of adhesions) and in cases of malignant tumours of the ovary which, although the procedure will give less precise information than laparotomy, has the advantage that it can be repeated from time to time."

D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC). Microscopically, all tumors had marked epithelial proliferation with abundant eosinophilic cells, and eight had intraluminal mucin. Multiple areas of microinvasion were found in eight cases. Additional unusual features were found in three cases. One patient presented with a serous LMP tumor in a supraclavicular lymph node. After resection of an ovarian serous LMP tumor, she was treated with chemotherapy and is without evidence of disease after 21 years. One patient had tumor resected at 24 weeks of gestation and at 2 months postpartum. Marked regression of the epithelial proliferation, the number of eosinophilic cells, and the amount of mucin was seen in the second specimen. Another patient had multiple peritoneal nodules at cesarean section, one of which was biopsied and diagnosed as a primary serous LMP of the peritoneum with multiple areas of microinvasion. Two months later a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and no residual disease was found. All patients are alive with no evidence of disease. In summary, serous LMP tumors during pregnancy have microscopic and clinical features suggesting aggressive behavior; however, these features appear to regress at the termination of the pregnancy."

There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications and postoperative recovery was rapid with all patients having function of the colostomy within 24 h and regaining their preoperative state of mobility on the second postoperative day. The laparoscopic approach allows the careful selection of the colostomy site, easy mobilisation of the colon causing only little disruption to the intestinal function and hence, improving postoperative recovery. From our experience, laparoscopic colostomy is a simple and safe operation in most cases and can be used as the preferred technique of intestinal diversion.

The Groshong was easily inserted intraperitoneally in 20 ovarian cancer patients and used to deliver 81 courses of intraperitoneal therapy over 2310 patient-days. There were no catheter-related complications during treatment and only one exit site infection after catheter removal.

CD009786,0,9007148,0,The management of dermoid cysts--a comparative study of laparoscopy and laparotomy.,The aim of our study was to compare laparoscopy with laparotomy for the removal of ovarian dermoid cysts. Thirty-eight women with benign ovarian dermoid cyst were allocated for either laparoscopy (18 patients) or laparotomy (20 patients). The two groups were compared for operative and hospitalization times and postoperative course. Operating time was longer (93.6 +/- 23.8 min) and hospitalization time significantly shorter (22.4 +/- 6.6 h) in the laparoscopy group. No complications were reported in either group. We conclude that operative laparoscopy is a safe procedure for the removal of dermoid ovarian cysts and is as effective as laparotomy.

CD009786,0,1838758,0,[Rupture of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. Value of celioscopic surgery].,"The rupture of haemorrhagic cysts of the ovary occur frequently and are often missed. Review of the literature and an analysis of our series of 20 patients makes it possible to summarise the typical clinical picture, which is of a young woman who has sudden severe pelvic pain in the second half of her menstrual cycle, during intercourse, or when she has pelvic trauma. Ultrasound in 90% of cases shows up signs suggesting the diagnosis and these are: a mass beside the uterus, or an intra-abdominal effusion. Endoscopic surgery is indicated particularly in women of reproductive age who suffer this pathology which is always benign. The indications to treat the patients should always take in to account the histology; 100% of these are luteal cysts. There is no reported case of cancer of the ovary or of an organic haemorrhagic cyst. On the other hand occasionally a primary ovarian pregnancy may occur and that can be confused with a haemorrhagic cyst. Finally haemorrhagic cysts can occur with an intra-uterine pregnancy and this means that the corpus luteum must be preserved. We propose the following treatment for those cases with symptoms: simple peritoneal washout when pregnancy has been ruled out on the laparoscopy exploration and when the bleeding is widespread: systematic taking of a biopsy for histology if there is the slightest doubt that there is a pregnancy in the ovary and an intraperitoneal removal of the cyst when haemorrhage persists during the operation."

We present the case of a 34-year-old woman who was admitted with the acute onset of abdominal pain and distension. A pelvic sonogram showed a large amount of peritoneal fluid with echogenic material and a 10-cm complex cystic structure, which appeared to be an enlarged left ovary. The concentrations of CA125 and CA19-9 were 548.1 and 7604 IU/mL, respectively. On the second day of admission, an exploratory laparoscopy was performed, which revealed a ruptured left ovarian cyst consistent with an endometrioma. A laparoscopic left adnexectomy was therefore performed. The histological examination of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of an endometrioma. After a 12-month follow-up period, the patient showed no recurrence of the endometrioma or peritoneal fluid accumulation. In most instances, the presence of massive ascites is associated with malignancies, tuberculosis, or a perforated viscus. The information provided in the present report is important to both gynecologists and oncologists because it shows that an ovarian cyst with ascites and highly elevated CA125 and CA19-9 levels might be benign."

All of these patients had responded clinically to a course of chemotherapy. Elective surgery was used to restage and debulk tumour. Ultrasound examination was done before surgery. Ultrasound was sensitive in detecting ovarian tumour in the pelvis and had an 84 per cent correlation with laparotomy. It was also sensitive in detecting liver and right diaphragmatic metastases with a 92 per cent correlation with the laparotomy findings. However, it consistently failed to detect intraperitoneal spread except when disease was gross or when it could be predicted by the presence of ascites. The correlation with laparotomy in this situation was only 36 per cent. This is to be expected as the size of most peritoneal deposits is below the resolution of ultrasound. These lesions, however, are easily detected by laparoscopy. These findings suggest that ultrasound has an important role in the management of advanced carcinoma of the ovary."

A review of three prospective randomised trials.,"The incidence of endometrial cancer is increasing throughout the world, and an appropriate safe and cost-effective surgical management is debated between traditional laparotomy and laparoscopy. Recently, three large prospective randomised controlled trials have been published comparing both modalities. The inclusion criteria for these studies are quite different, and whilst many of the outcomes reported are similar, some such as blood loss, complications, length of stay and quality of life (QoL) may have suffered as a result of selection bias. Some of these biases include differences in the stage of patients included, tumour grade, tumour histology, performance status, the requirement to undertake and complete surgical staging and the methodology of QoL assessment. An overall analysis of these studies shows that whilst there are advantages (and disadvantages) to both surgical approaches, overall there is no convincing evidence of the superiority of one surgical approach over the other. What is probably more important for the individual surgeon consenting a patient for surgery is to offer an approach consistent with good oncological outcomes."

Abdominal pain caused by isolated tubal torsion is extremely rare. In the report, we presented a case of isolated tubal torsion caused by benign serous cystadenoma. A 28-year-old married woman (G0) having lower abdominal pain and nausea was referred to our Emergency Room with suspicion of ovarian mass. Physical examination, transvaginal ultrasound and computed tomography showed a 4-cm right adnexal cystic mass. Other laboratory data were all within normal limits. She was managed by laparoscopic examination due to a lack of improvement in her clinical symptoms and inclusive diagnosis after 48-hours' conservative treatment. Laparoscopy showed isolated torsion of right fallopian tube but the right ovary was normal without torsion. Initially, detorsion was performed but necrotic change of the fallopian tube persisted because of permanent darkened color tube without blood flow redistribution, so salpingectomy was performed 30 minutes later. Final pathology showed benign serous cystadenoma of fallopian tube. The present case is the first case of benign serous cystadenoma with resultant necrotic tubal torsion.

Peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid were collected from 12 patients with primary ovarian cancer with ascites and 27 normal control subjects during laparoscopic examination. Lymphocyte subpopulations and the expression of activation markers on T lymphocytes were analyzed by dual-color flow cytometry. The concentrations of various cytokines and soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor-alpha were measured. CD8 T lymphocytes were the main component of peritoneal lymphocytes. CD69 and HLA-DR, but not CD25, were highly expressed on peritoneal T lymphocytes compared to those in peripheral blood. In ascitic fluid of ovarian malignancies, CD4 T lymphocyte concentrations were further decreased, resulting in a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio. Decreased expression of CD69 and CD25 was also noted on T lymphocytes from ascites compared with T lymphocytes in normal peritoneal fluid. IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and soluble IL-2 receptor-alpha concentrations were increased significantly in the ascitic fluid of women with ovarian cancer. The decrease in activation markers on T lymphocytes is suggestive of an immunosuppressive state, despite the presence of abundant stimulatory cytokines. The immunosuppression may be multifactorial, attributed, in part, to the increased concentrations of soluble IL-2 receptor-alpha and other inhibitors."

The operation, which carried negligible morbidity, demonstrated complete remission in 27,5% of the cases; whenever necessary and possible achieved complete remission by surgical excision; and helped in establishing a second course of chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy. This therapeutic strategy seems to have had overall favourable repercussions on the patients' short- and mid-term survical. Long-term results cannot yet be assessed, but the knowledge of late failures suggests that applying intensive chemotherapy or, preferably, chemo-immunotherapy after the ""second look"", or even reserving potent cytostatic drugs for that period, could be beneficial.

These include: (1) tubal sterilization; (2) salpingectomy and salpingostomy for tubal pregnancy; (3) fimbrioplasty, salpingoneostomy, and linear salpingostomy for tubal obstruction and infertility; (4) microsurgical tubal reanastomosis for reversal of tubal sterilization; (5) oophorectomy, cystectomy, cyst drainage and fulguration, and excision of ovarian tumors; (6) wedge resection and ovarian drilling for polycystic ovaries; and (7) fulguration and laser vaporization for endometriosis. Many of these procedures are conservative and involve reconstruction of the tube and ovaries to preserve fertility. Microsurgical techniques are incorporated into such fertility sparing or enhancing procedures. Comparison of similar surgical procedures on the tube and ovaries indicates better or similar surgical outcome when done through the laparoscope rather than laparotomy; less blood loss, faster recovery, and cheaper cost are the hallmarks when the procedure is done by laparoscopy. With further improvement and expansion in laparoscopy equipment, it can be expected that more surgical procedures on the adnexa can be undertaken safely and effectively."

During a one year period (from August 1994 till July 1995) 42 patients underwent pelvic and para-aortic laparoscopic lymphadenectomy. In 29 cases cervical cancer, in 11 cases endometrial cancer and in 2 cases tumors of low malignant potential of the ovary were the indication for lymphadenectomy which was combined with radical vaginal hysterectomy in 19 patients or simple vaginal hysterectomy in 13 patients. During the observation period the mean operating time for para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy decreased and the efficiency of the lymphadenectomy increased significantly: the mean operating time for the first 10 para-aortic lymphadenectomies was 52 minutes and for the pelvic lymphadenectomies 141 minutes, respectively. For the last 10 procedures the para-aortic part took 35 minutes and the pelvic part 110 minutes. Whereas at the beginning of the study a mean of 25 lymph nodes were removed, a mean of 36 lymph nodes were sampled during the last 10 procedures. In 3 patients operative injuries to major vessels were encountered of which two were followed by laparotomy. In 3 other patients laparotomy due to postoperative hemorrhage was necessary. These 6 complications occurred during the first half of the study and were not encountered during the following operations by changing from monopolar to bipolar coagulation and by modifying the regimen for perioperative thrombosis prophylaxis. In the first half of the study in 9 women blood transfusions were necessary and in the second half only 4 patients had to be transfused. In the first 10 patients the mean intraoperative blood loss was 1300 cc, in the last 10 patients 300 cc. After a short learning curve laparoscopic para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy is a safe and effective technique for staging cervical, endometrial, and early ovarian cancers. Though this technique is no standard procedure results of this pilot study warrant prospective studies comparing this technique with conventional procedures."

F.D.P. were found in the serum (0.5-30 mg/100 ml) of 23 (72%) out of 32 patients with malignant tumours. Of 131 patients with benign findings F.D.P. (traces to 2 mg/100 ml) were found in six (4.5%), and in most of these the occurrence of F.D.P. could be explained on other clinical grounds. The findings suggest that the examination of F.D.P. in suspected malignant ovarian tumour may be of diagnostic value.Determination of F.D.P. in malignant ascitic fluid showed very high values, ranging between 40 and 350 mg/ 100 ml. This argues for the occurrence of F.D.P. in the blood being due to an extravascular breakdown of fibrin caused by tumour cells, but they may also be due to thromboplastic and fibrinolytic agents from the tumour entering the blood stream."

CD009786,0,9263716,0,Laparoscopic management of gynecological malignancies.,"The primary surgical management of endometrial and cervical carcinoma requires four operations: simple and radical hysterectomy, and pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy. All these four operations can now be carried out laparoscopically with significant reduction in morbidity and among the patient population that develops these malignancies, namely, the elderly and the obese. Moreover, as judged by the number of nodes harvested and the proportion of positive nodes, the radicality of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy is equivalent to its 'open' counterpart. Thus, laparoscopic management is feasible in almost every patient who has carcinoma of the endometrium or cervix. Experience with the laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer is more limited. There has been concern that the increased frequency of cyst rupture makes laparoscopic management inappropriate, but cyst rupture per se does not impair survival provided patients are managed appropriately with adjuvant chemotherapy, and all but stage I, grade I ovarian cancer is treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Many patients who have stage II-IV disease can be satisfactorily 'debulked' laparoscopically, and a significant proportion of those who cannot be debulked primarily can be debulked laparoscopically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer promises to be the most active area of advance over the next few years."

The majority of women were premenopausal (93.6%) and the most common procedure performed was an ovarian cystectomy (73.5% of cysts). Three ovarian cysts that were thought to be benign by preoperative and intraoperative assessment were subsequently found to be ovarian tumours of low malignant potential after histological examination.

CD009786,0,8851090,0,[Laparoscopy in (apparently) benign ovarian tumors between benefit and catastrophy and the deceptive safety of laparoscopic lap sacs].,"Endoscopic ovarian surgery is currently spreading tremendously, but also rather uncritically. The technical possibilities both of organ preserving and ablative endoscopic surgery are controversial, so that structuring of the indication for an endoscopic procedure as well as optimization of the endoscopic removal of ovarian tumor or adnexae is of utmost relevance. Therefore, a study was performed at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the Heidelberg University with the following aims: Risk evaluation of operating into an ovarian malignancy at endoscopy for ""presumably"" benign cystic ovarian tumors in n = 100 cases in Heidelberg and literature survey Analysis of problems and complications during clinical application of laparoscopic lap sacs for removal of cystic adnexal tumors or adnexae (n = 50) Experimental examination of the risk of an endoscopic lap sacs to rupture during a procedure The risk of endoscopically operating into an ovarian cancer lies between 0.4 and 3% according to literature data. Despite maximal preoperative selection, mainly by ultrasound examination, in our group of 100 patients, in three women without preoperative signs of malignancy but with discreet intracystic structures in the ultrasound, an endoscopic adnexectomy with complete removal in a lap sac was performed, and though immediate section for microscopic examination was negative, final histology revealed one ovarian cancer la and 2 borderline tumors, same stage. In the time period analyzed, three further patients were referred to our center for secondary, delayed (median 3 months) staging after endoscopic procedures for presumed benign lesions. Clinical application of lap sacs proved the necessity of an intensive training. In 3 patients an intraperitoneal rupture of the sac occurred. Typical problems were volume discrepancies between sac respectively abdominal incision and tissue to be removed (28% of cases). The risk of rupture of the various lap sacs examined differed significantly (p < 0.05). Due to the complex pathological nature of cystic adnexal tumors, a 100% selection for the endoscopic approach is not feasible. Therefore, an endoscopic procedure should only be performed after optimal preoperative diagnosis and, in case of the slightest doubt, only if intraoperative microscopic examination is available, and the possibility to perform an immediate staging laparotomy. Sufficient information of the patient is relevant. Laparoscopic removal of tumor or adnexae should be performed in a lap sac. However, there is no absolute certainty of preventing spillage even with the lap sac, since not all endoscopic sacs available are of a sufficient quality."

When the level of CA-125 is above 35 U/ml that suggests that there may be a malignant neoplasm present. The test is sensitive to about 78.6% and specific at 76%. 96 cysts were considered to be benign using clinical and para-clinical examinations and were punctured under ultrasound control or laparoscopically.

Antitumour murine mAbs (HMFG1, HMFG2, H317, and H17E2) and the reshaped human antibody Hu2PLAP (against placental alkaline phosphatase; PLAP), labelled with indium-111 and iodine-123, were evaluated for their ability to localise ovarian tumours in sequential studies of our group. Thirty patients with ovarian cancer, aged 40-78 years (median 60 years) were studied with HMFG1/G2: 11, and H317/H17E2: 19 murine mAbs. Six patients with ovarian cancer aged between 36 and 65 years (median 49 years) were studied with the reshaped human Hu2PLAP mAb (5 patients) or the murine H17E2 mAb (2 patients) labelled with 111In via a new macrocyclic chelating agent (DOTA). One of these was imaged twice, with H17E2- and Hu2PLAP-DOTA-111In, respectively. In 20 out of 22 patients with radiologically measurable ovarian cancer, the presence of tumour was confirmed by the murine mAb scan and correlated well with the findings of conventional radiology diagnostic methods. One of these patients with a negative H17E2 scan and a large abdominal mass at laparotomy was found to have a PLAP-negative tumour on immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the antibody scan revealed the presence of active disease, confirmed at laparotomy/laparoscopy, in 6 out of 8 patients considered to be in clinical complete remission. Best images were obtained at 24 and 48 h after the 123I and 111In mAbs, respectively. Successful imaging with the reshaped human antibody, Hu2PLAP, was seen in 2 patients with PLAP-positive tumours. Antibodies to DOTA developed in 2 patients. In conclusion, immunolocalisation of ovarian tumours is feasible with both murine and reshaped human mAbs. The sensitivity and specificity of the method appear very high in this pilot study, and in view of the absence of toxicity, the diagnostic contribution of this approach should be evaluated prospectively. Given the low number of patients without surgically detectable disease in the present study, future investigations should include more patients with no evidence of disease in order to provide more meaningful estimates of specificity."

Despite periodic extensive searches for an underlying malignancy, no malignancy had been detected in this patient during the first 2.5 years after the diagnosis of DM. It was only when the patient presented with pleural effusion and ascites that the underlying intra-abdominal malignancy was detected by laparoscopy. Treatment with four cycles of pre-operative chemotherapy (taxol and cisplatin) resulted in tumor regression with amelioration in the muscular manifestation of the DM, but without parallelic amelioration in the skin manifestations of the DM. Explorative laparotomy confirmed the presence of papillary serous carcinoma in the omentum, surface of the left ovary and the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and established the diagnosis of PPSC. Following two cycles of postoperative chemotherapy, the patient is alive with no evidence of internal malignancy. However, although muscle strength and enzymes have remained normal, no effect on the skin manifestation of DM has been observed. This case illustrates that, alongside the more frequently occurring ovarian carcinoma, PPSC should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of the underlying malignancy that may occur in the female patient with DM."

Among 35 patients, 18 patients (51.4%) were treated with laparoscopy, and 17 patients (48.6%) were treated with laparotomy. There were no statistically significant differences except for hospital stay (laparoscopy vs. laparotomy five days vs. nine days, p < 0.05). Eight patients (44.4%) in the laparoscopy group and six (35.3%) in the laparotomy group were found to be pathologically positive after the second look operation. There were two recurrences (20.0%) in the laparoscopy group and four (36.4%) in the laparotomy group pathologically negative in the second-look operation (p = 0.557). There were no differences in disease-free survival rates (p = 0.705) between the two groups.

However one also has to take into consideration the possibility of an ovarian germ cell tumour. The latter occurs in young patients, presents as an ovarian mass and can produce HCG. The preoperative and even intraoperative diagnosis are difficult. In these cases where there is a suspected ovarian mass and no clear diagnosis a laparoscopic approach should be considered.

We point out the different biological behaviour of malignant mature teratomas and immature teratomas. We agree with the majority of authors that the method of choice is the intact removal of all teratomas without iatrogen rupture or contamination of the abdominal cavity by contents of the teratoma. This adequate surgical procedure can and should be performed by laparotomy or laparoscopy with endobag. The often practised method of cutting open the cyst during laparoscopy, sucking off the contents or cutting the teratoma into pieces, has been proven to lead to implantation and worsening the prognosis in case of a malignant teratoma. Even the rinsing of the abdominal cavity, usually carried out with this method, could not compensate always for the disadvantage of this ""dirty"" endoscopical method compared with usual oncological standards. This is pointed out by case reports in the literature and the first analysis of a German survey with early-follow-up of 192 laparoscopically managed ovarian malignancies [11a].

The majority of patients will seek medical advice because of menstrual disturbances, infertility or signs of hyperandrogeneamia (hirsutism, acne, alopecia). In obese patients the therapeutic mainstay is weight reduction. Anovulatory infertility is treated by stimulation of ovulation, laparoscopic electrocautery or IVF, while patients with menstrual disturbances without a wish to conceive should be treated with cyclic gestagen therapy or oral contraceptives in order to reduce the increased life-long risk of endometrial cancer.

They probably are a one-sided development of a teratoma, which arise from germ cells after the first meiotic division due to either a meiosis I or a meiosis II non dysjunction. Diagnosis is possible only with histological examination and immunohistochemistry which allow us to differentiate carcinoids from sex-cord tumors and ependymomas. Prognosis is very good because the rate of malignant transformation is 1.4%-2% and the rate of complications is 14%. Thus conservative surgical therapy associated with long-term follow-up is the treatment of choice."
CD009786,0,2375222,0,Prospective comparative cytologic study of direct peritoneal smears and lavage fluids in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and benign gynecologic disease.,"Direct peritoneal samples obtained by scraping or brushing (with a Cytobrush) were compared to peritoneal lavages (washings) for the cytologic evaluation of patients with gynecologic disease. The direct samples were obtained during laparotomy or laparoscopy, following saline lavage if that was performed, and were immediately smeared on glass slides and fixed in 95% alcohol. Only 9 of the direct peritoneal samples taken from 64 patients with benign gynecologic disease were unsatisfactory for cytologic interpretation while 19 of the 33 lavage specimens simultaneously collected from these patients were considered unsuitable for analysis (P less than .001). Two direct smears from cases with benign histology were reported as suspicious. Nineteen patients with epithelial ovarian cancer also had cytologic specimens collected by direct sampling and by washing. The direct smears were positive for malignancy in 12 cases, suspicious in 4 cases and negative in 3 cases while the lavage samples were positive in 9 cases, suspicious in 4 cases, negative in 4 cases and unsatisfactory in 2 cases. These results indicate that direct peritoneal sampling is a simple and reliable alternative to peritoneal lavage and produces a significantly lower incidence of unsatisfactory specimens."

They are generally recognized either immediately or a few days after the operation. We present a case of laparoscopic perforation of the small intestine in a patient who had undergone previous pelvic surgery for an ovarian carcinoma. On ultrasound (US), the patient had multiple hepatic lesions resembling hepatic metastases. To confirm the diagnosis, laparoscopy with guided liver biopsy was performed on the grounds that this procedure is regarded as more appropriate than CT- or US-guided hepatic biopsy. Veress needle and trocar insertion were performed at a proper distance from the abdominal scar. However, the abdominal cavity was not visible after the trocar's insertion due to the unexpected presence of adhesions. This precluded the continuation of the procedure. In the following days, the patient experienced only mild abdominal discomfort. However, 2 weeks after laparoscopy, the patient presented signs of peritoneal reaction and underwent laparotomy. Adhesion-fixing jejunal loops to the anterior abdominal wall were discovered at the site of the trocar puncture. Moreover, two hiatuses of these loops were observed and sutured. The follow-up was uneventful. As this case illustrates, laparoscopic bowel injuries remain an unpredictable event. Recognition of this complication may occur several days after the procedure, as the tamponating effect of adhesions on the jejunal hiatus delays the involvement of the peritoneum."

A 28-year-old female patient exhibited intraperitoneal carcinomatosis after a laparoscopic surgery for ruptured mature teratoma of the ovary with occult malignant transformation. The complication was found two months after initial laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was smooth including oophorectomy, and removing all spilled specimens within the abdominal cavity. At the end of the laparoscopic surgery, cleaning the abdominal cavity and irritating the port site were also performed. Cytology of the abdominal cavity and all removed specimens did not show evidence of malignancy. She followed up regularly and uneventfully except for persistently abdominal fullness and erythematous change of umbilical portal site. Evidence demonstrated intestinal obstruction associated with ascites after a detailed evaluation. Although the patient received supportive treatment the symptom exacerbated. Therefore, the patient was treated with exploratory laparotomy. Pathology proved with intraperitoneal carcinomatosis caused by squamous cell carcinoma. All tumor evaluations including tumor markers, a thorough physical examination, imaging studies and evaluations of the nuclear medicine were negative except of intraperitoneal carcinoma, origin to be determined. The patient is dead 14 months' post-treatment by exploratory laparotomy. Although it was not clear that the laparoscopic approach or the disease itself worsened indeed the prognosis because the disease was already disseminated before the laparoscopy, we still emphasized the possible limitation of laparoscopic surgery if diagnosis at original surgery is impaired, of if excision is incomplete and the delay between the laparoscopic procedure and the carcinomatosis."

CD009786,0,6617038,0,Importance of proper staging in ovarian carcinoma.,"Therefore, on discovery of a clinical Stage I or II ovarian carcinoma through a previously made subumbilical incision, the incision should be extended above the umbilicus to enable one to inspect the diaphragm and remove the omentum from the transverse colon. Biopsy of any raised lesion of the diaphragm can easily be done with laparoscopic biopsy forceps and is associated with minimal morbidity. Routine biopsy of a normal appearing diaphragm is not advocated. Pelvic and paracolic washings for cytological evaluation for malignant cells are obtained by instilling 100-200 cm3 of saline into the pelvis and a similar amount into the right and left paracolic spaces, respectively, and aspirating the fluid for cytological evaluation. Most women with ovarian cancers are still primarily operated on by gynaecologists who are not trained in para-aortic and pelvic lymph node sampling. Ideally, however, women with clinical Stage I or II ovarian cancers should have biopsy of any palpable para-aortic or pelvic lymph node. Such careful surgical staging will: define those patients who are apt to truly have Stage I or II ovarian cancer; improve and refine adjuvant therapy for Stage I and II ovarian cancer; and allow for adjuvant therapy for patients found to have Stage III ovarian cancer, discovered at the time of surgical staging for presumed localized ovarian cancer. The significance of the latter is seen in Table 10 and in the fact that with the subsequent increase to 61 patients evaluated by the Ovarian Cancer Study Group, the incidence of occult metastases from Stage I and II ovarian cancer remain strikingly unchanged (Young et al, 1983, unpublished observations)."

Unless a patient has major endometriosis and needs advanced surgery, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggest a 'see and treat' policy. Thus, gynaecologists who undertake laparoscopy should be competent at performing intermediate level laparoscopic surgery, including excision of endometriosis, adhesions and benign ovarian tumours, rather than converting to laparotomy or referring patients to another unit. In order to reduce operative risk and make best use of resources, preoperative assessment should triage patients into those with unlikely pelvic pathology who do not require laparoscopy in the first instance, those with severe endometriosis, who need referral to a specialist centre and the intermediate group who is best served with a 'see and treat' policy."

CD009786,0,294768,0,Fine needle aspiration of ovarian masses. I. Correlative cytologic and histologic study of celomic epithelial neoplasms.,"The ovary is commonly involved by a wide variety of neoplasms and nonneoplastic masses. Seventy-seven ovarian masses were aspirated using fine needles. They included 29 neoplasms classified as being of celomic epithelial origin. The study was performed in order to elucidate the cytologic features of material aspirated from these neoplasms and to correlate them with the histologic features. As expected, material aspirated from malignant neoplasms was much more cellular than material obtained from benign neoplasms. By studying the background material, nuclear and cytoplasmic features of the epithelial cells, as well as the presence of other structures such as psammoma and hyaline bodies, a fairly specific pattern can be recognized for each neoplasm. Using aspiration cytology, a conclusion can be made regarding the malignant or benign nature as well as the specific type and classification of the ovarian neoplasms. Aspiration cytology, especially with the increased use of laparoscopy, has a specific role to play in the diagnosis of celomic epithelial neoplasms of the ovary.

Twenty-three had epithelial ovarian cancer and 2 had advanced endometrial cancer. Twelve patients received IP carboplatin and IV doxorubicin at the conclusion of their primary cytoreduction. The remaining 13 received IP carboplatin alone and consisted of 4 reassessment laparotomies for ovarian cancer, 7 secondary cytoreductions, 1 minilaparotomy for the placement of an IP catheter, and 1 second-look laparoscopy. The median age of the 25 patients was 59 years. Eight patients underwent bowel resections with anastomoses; 2 had ureteral resections and ureteroneocystostomies, 1 required a splenectomy, and 1 underwent a partial hepatic resection. There were no mortalities. Three of the 13 patients who received the IP carboplatin alone had postoperative fevers with no infectious source, which did not delay discharge. No other morbidity was noted in this group. However, 7 patients who received IV doxorubicin along with the IP carboplatin developed severe leukopenia requiring antimicrobial and colony-stimulating factor support.

CD009786,0,7557204,0,[Total pelviscopic removal of ovarian tumors in a bag bag posterior colpotomy].,"Treatment of suspicious ovarian masses requires the oophorectomy in toto without opening the tumor or cyst wall. We describe a laparoscopic technique for the in-toto-removal of clinically suspicious ovarian tumours without puncture or morcellation of the tumour before it is entirely brought outside of the abdominal wall and without performing any abdominal incision longer than 25 mm: Oophorectomy is performed by means of bipolar coagulation and the CO2-laser. A nylon bag (Lapsac, Cook Inc.) is inserted into the abdomen and the ovary is enclosed in this bag by pulling the drawstring. The drawstring is held with a needleholder while the posterior vaginal fornix is opened. The needleholder drives the drawstring out of the pelvis through the vagina; this manoeuvre only takes a short amount of time, therefore preventing loss of CO2-gas and of visibility. By pulling the drawstring from outside the vagina the bag can be easily removed with its unmorcellated content. There is no danger of the intestines being damaged by a grasping forceps. Such a problem could occur in the event of extraction through a posterior culdotomy under impaired visibility due to loss of CO2-gas. Because the bag itself serves as a closing valve of the vaginal opening, there is a good visibility all the time."

The age of patients differed from 16-61 years (mean +/- s: 36 +/- 16). The histopathologic findings yielded 15 (11.8%) functional cysts, 30 (23.6%) persistent corpus luteum cysts, 9 (7.1%) endometriomas, 7 (5.5%) cystic teratomas, 9 (7.1%) undifferenciated cysts and 57 (44.9%) cystadenomas. There were no differences between histopathologic diagnosis groups according to age and cysts size by ultrasound. Functional cysts with complaints (n = 6) may explain that the observation time in 60% of all functional cysts was smaller than 6 weeks, whereas persistent corpus luteum cysts, endometriomas, cystic teratoma and cystadenomas had been observed for longer than 6 weeks in more than two thirds. Intraoperative evaluation of cysts content as ""chocolate""-like was suspicious of endometriomas, but was also present in cysts of other histopathological findings. By means of cytology, endometrioma (siderophages) was suspected in 44.4% and a cystadenoma in 42.1% of all histopathologically verified cases. In all, the cytologic findings were useful for correct histopathological diagnosis in only 33.9% of all 127 cases. It is concluded that differential diagnosis of simple ovarian cysts is not possible by clinical characteristics, neither by ultrasound nor by cytological evaluation. Ovarian cysts should be observed for at least two hormonal cycles. A hormonal treatment by combination preparations containing high doses of oestrogen is also recommended. In cases of persisting ovarian cysts laparoscopic removal is necessary."

The patient's menstrual periods had been regular since menarche at the age of 12 until she became amenorrheic at the age of 20. She visited our facility in November 1988 after receiving three cycles of estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy from a previous physician which caused withdrawal bleeding. Clomiphen citrate reportedly failed to induce apparent ovulation. On her first visit with us, she was 160 cm tall weighing 47 kg with apparent hoarseness but not with hirsutism. Pelvic examination revealed significant clitoromegaly but otherwise normal external and internal genitalia. Laparoscopic examination disclosed that her uterus appeared to be normal with bilateral ovaries relatively small (4 x 4 x 3 cm) without tumorous or polycystic appearance. Histological examination of her ovaries obtained at laparoscopy showed several primary follicles with mild infiltration of the stromal cells. No thickened tunica albuginea or cystic formation were observed. These findings did not support either polycystic ovary or hyperthecosis. Serum testosterone (T) levels were extremely high (7.1 ng/ml), while serum androstenedione levels were only slightly above normal range (3.1 ng/ml). Urine 17-KS excretion was slightly increased (6.1 mg/day), while 17-OHCS output was within normal range (4.0 mg/day). Basal serum LH and FSH levels were within normal range and LH pulse frequency was reduced to 1 in 4 hours. Administration of dexamethasone 1 mg/day for 2 days did not suppress circulating T and free T levels but lowered serum cortisol concentration and urine excretion of 17-OHCS. Blood glucose and insulin levels were within normal limits and their responses to oral glucose administration were normal. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography and computed tomography as well as adrenal scintigraphy did not reveal any tumorous lesions in bilateral adrenals and ovaries. Administration of GnRH agonist, Buserelin 900 micrograms/day, suppressed circulating T concentrations to 0.7 ng/ml in 8 days, while it had no significant effects on DHEA and DHEA-S levels. After 16 weeks of Buserelin administration, ovulation was successfully induced by hMG administration. Cyclic estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy by Kaufmann's schedule for 2 cycles also suppressed serum T levels to normal, female range. Thus, the present case represents non-neoplastic, non-PCO, ovarian hypertestosteronism which responded well both to GnRH agonist and estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy in terms of lowering circulating T levels."

The selection criteria were adnexal cystic masses greater than 3 cm but less than 10 cm, the masses were in the benign range (4-8) of Sassone's scoring system for transvaginal ultrasonography, and the patients had serum CA-125 levels less than 65 IU/mL. Two hundred nineteen women fulfilled the criteria and underwent operative laparoscopy. Almost all the masses (99.5%) were accurately predicted to be benign except for one borderline ovarian tumor. Two hundreds thirteen (97.3%) women were successfully managed by operative laparoscopy and six (2.7%) required laparotomy. For the patients managed by laparoscopy, the mean operative time was 51.3 min; the mean hospital stay was 2.5 days. There was no significant morbidity and surgery-related mortality. The combination of the Sassone's scoring system for transvaginal ultrasonography and serum CA-125 level can accurately predict benign cystic masses, and operative laparoscopy is technically feasible and safe for the management of adnexal mass in postmenopausal women."

Three hundred and ninety three were urgent laparoscopies: 325 patients with acute spontaneous abdomen and 68 acute traumatic abdomen. Emergency laparoscopy is made in patients with, both spontaneous and traumatic acute abdomen, when diagnosis is not made in 8 hours with the usual clinical and imaging methods. Acute diffuse peritonitis was the commonest finding in the first group (21%) and splenic rupture in the traumatic group (34%). There were two severe complications (0.5%): pulmonary oedema in a patient with myocardial disease and a respiratory failure in a old patient, which were resolved. We had two deaths related to laparoscopic diagnosis: massive mesenteric thrombosis and fecal peritonitis. There are few contraindications and tolerance is very good. This study shows a sensitivity of 98%, a specificity of 90%, a predictive positive value greater than 98% and a negative predictive value of 100%. In summary, the present study demonstrates that emergency laparoscopy is a effective diagnostic method in acute abdominal pain of uncertain aetiology."

In 462 of these cases, we performed laparoscopic surgery with 679 therapeutical interventions. Sterilisation is the most frequent operation in our cases of Fallopian tube surgery, but we have also had tubal pregnancy in 5 cases. In ovarian surgery, we found a great number of benign ovarian cysts followed by a high rate of ovarian adhesions, which, counted together with the Fallopian tube and intestinal adhesions, amounted to 201 cases. In 9 women, the extirpation of a myoma was necessary and the largest one was 5.5 cm in diameter. In comparison with the total number of our surgical interventions, we had a high rate of appendectomies. Each surgeon is aware of the various locations of the appendix, of its close relation to the adnexae and the difficulty of clinical diagnosis of appendicitis in women, especially in pregnant women. We removed the appendix in two pregnant women (4th and 18th week of pregnancy). A pathological substrate was found in more than 80%. Because of a good preliminary selection of our patients, we found no carcinoma in the abdominal cavity, except from an early metastasis on the appendix of an ovarian carcinoma. This patient came for staging re-laparoscopy after treatment of the ovarian carcinoma years ago. Since the beginning of 1989, we have used a Neodym: Yag laser in endoscopic operations.

In cases of urological complications after irradiation therapy, radionephrography, infusion urogram, blood count, cystoscopy, and cystometry should also be carried out after two months. Depending on the clinical picture, radionephrography, blood count and urinalysis are to be repeated in regular intervals. After lymphography with positive findings, x-ray controls are necessary after two and four months.

CD009786,0,17617524,0,Management of borderline ovarian neoplasms.,"Over the last decades, the management of borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) has changed from radical surgery to more conservative therapy as a result of the need for fertility-sparing surgery and the increasing use of laparoscopy. The question is whether this is good clinical practice from an oncologic point of view. Here, recent literature regarding management of borderline ovarian neoplasms is reviewed, and oncologic concerns are discussed with emphasis on the mode of surgery and the possibility of fertility-sparing surgery and its consequences. Proper staging is defined as an exploration of the entire abdominal cavity with peritoneal washings, infracolic omentectomy, and multiple peritoneal biopsies as the cornerstone of a successful treatment, and this is only possible through a midline incision. For stage I disease, conservative surgery consisting of unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or cystectomy in case of bilateral ovarian involvement or when the disease develops in the only remaining ovary is a valuable alternative in a number of young patients who want to preserve their fertility. Patients with advanced-stage disease or who are finished childbearing are treated with radical surgery consisting of peritoneal washings, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy, complete peritoneal resection of macroscopic lesions, or multiple peritoneal biopsies; in case of mucinous BOTs, patients also are treated with an appendectomy."

CD009786,0,9440109,0,Intraoperative laparoscopic sonography for improved preoperative sonographic pathologic characterization of adnexal masses.,"This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopic sonography and transvaginal sonography in the evaluation of adnexal masses. Fifty-eight women underwent transvaginal sonography, which showed 69 adnexal masses, and laparoscopic ultrasonography, which showed 68 adnexal lesions. Conventional gray-scale ultrasonography (using transvaginal sonography and laparoscopic ultrasonography) was performed with morphologic characterization of internal architecture, followed by color Doppler imaging with spectral Doppler analysis where possible. A specific diagnosis was obtained with transvaginal sonography and laparoscopic ultrasonography based on a combination of imaging features. The specific diagnosis obtained with each imaging modality was compared with the final histologic diagnosis as the gold standard in 57 patients with 68 adnexal masses who underwent cystectomy or oophorectomy. The ability of laparoscopic sonography to detect the contralateral ovary and any residual ovarian tissue in the presence of a mass was also compared with transvaginal sonography. The accuracy of laparoscopic ultrasonography in the characterization of adnexal masses was 83.8% and that of transvaginal sonography was 73.5% (P < 0.05). Laparoscopic sonography showed greater morphologic detail than that obtained with transvaginal sonography, allowed more precise and specific characterization of adnexal masses, and detected additional adnexal lesions not evident on preoperative transvaginal sonography. Laparoscopic ultrasonography showed the contralateral ovary in 86.2% of patients, compared with 81.0% using transvaginal sonography (P = 0.51). In addition, laparoscopic ultrasonography was able to demonstrate the presence of residual ovarian tissue in the side affected pathologically in 76.5% of patients compared with 59.4% using transvaginal sonography (P < 0.005). Laparoscopic sonography allows more precise morphologic characterization of internal architecture and histologic diagnosis of adnexal lesions, but it is as yet unable to increase the diagnostic accuracy of borderline or malignant lesions, possibly due to the small sample size. Laparoscopic sonography is superior to transvaginal sonography in the evaluation of residual ovarian tissue in the side affected pathologically, which may help in surgical planning between cystectomy and oophorectomy, and also in the identification of the contralateral ovary, which may potentially increase the detection of bilateral pathologic conditions."

Twenty-two patients with FIGO stages IIB, III, and IV ovarian adenocarcinoma underwent second-look laparoscopy after a median of 23 months of therapy. Eight (36.3%) patients had documented evidence of persistent ovarian cancer and were thus spared second-look laparotomy. Moreover, in 4 patients (18.1%), malignant cells in cytologic washings were the only laparoscopic evidence of persistent ovarian cancer. The absence of visible tumor and malignant cells in cytologic washings allows for the use of second-look laparotomy while the patient is under 1 anesthesia; the presence of tumor or malignant cells in cytologic washings spares the patient second-look laparotomy at that time."

Nevertheless, results of ongoing randomized studies should be waited before stating about the results on survival of such management compared to initial debulking surgery. Waiting such results, the standard treatment of advanced stage ovarian cancer in 2005 remains initial surgery, performed in order to obtain ideally a total resection of all macroscopic diseases, and followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. However, in patients with massive spread, interval debulking surgery is becoming an interesting option, and will perhaps become a standard management. But criteria to select patients between initial and interval debulking surgery should be clearly defined. Those different points will be studied in this paper."

The positive predictive value of frozen section in the diagnosis of a malignant lesion was 100% (34 of 34). Errors were mainly made in the diagnosis of borderline tumours with a predictive value of 87.5% (7 of 8). The negative predictive value was 98.4% (127 of 129). Frozen section however, was less accurate in the diagnosis of specific histological type with an accuracy rate of 91.9% (159 of 173). Macroscopic features were found to be useful in the intraoperative prediction of malignant potential. Completely cystic tumours were benign in 96.4% (108 of 167) of cases. Solid/cystic tumors were malignant in 69% (27 of 38) of cases. Completely solid tumours were malignant in 56% (9 of 16) of cases.

Recent acquisitions].,"The authors report on their experience with two cases of Krukenberg's tumour treated at Chioggia Hospital in patients admitted for pelvic tumours. The clinical manifestation of Krukenberg's tumour is mainly related to the presence of the pelvic mass even in advanced forms of gastrointestinal cancers. The authors stress the importance of an adequate follow-up of premenopausal patients with a previous gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma because the incidence of ovarian metastases is quite frequent and influences the prognosis. The Authors do not consider a bilateral preventive ovariectomy associated with gastrectomy as advisable in premenopausal patients, because the studies to date are inadequate for the purposes of drawing conclusions regarding the benefit of these procedures. They consider a more valid policy to be a thorough follow-up in women with a previous gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma because the priority must be accorded to diagnosing secondary lesions so as to be able to perform an ovariectomy which may improve the prognosis. With this in mind it is important to assess Ca 19.9 and perform radiological procedures, such as CT and MRI. The prognosis may be distinctly unfavourable as in one of the cases reported by the Authors involving a very rare form of secondary lesion of the bone marrow and consequent medullary aplasia, with the onset of severe haemorrhages in several areas leading to the patient's death. They consider that surgical treatment should be preceded by a diagnostic laparoscopy.

A few ovarian lesions have been reported that are associated with massive ovarian edema. This article describes the first case of an ovarian serous cystadenoma associated with a massive ovarian edema. The patient was a 17-year-old female who was referred to the emergency room because of lower abdominal pain. Subsequent ultrasound and computed tomography scanning studies revealed an abdominopelvic cystic mass suggestive of an ovarian neoplasm. She underwent an exploratory laparoscopy, and a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The specimen weighed 1610 g and consisted of a cystic mass measuring 17 x 15 x 8 cm attached to a solid mass measuring 13 x 11 x 4 cm. Microscopy revealed a cystic and a solid lesion. The cystic structure was composed of a flat or cuboidal single-layer lining showing ciliated epithelium and focal areas of papillary structures compatible with a diagnosis of ovarian serous cystadenoma. The solid mass had an intact capsule and diffuse interstitial edema, preserving the overall structure of the ovary and sparing the outer cortex.

In the Professorial Unit at Glasgow Royral Infirmary, the findings (over a three years period), obtained by the laparoscopic investigation of the infertile woman, are given. It is found that laparoscopy frequently identifies a possible cause of infertility in women whose failure to conceive has remained unexplained by other methods of investigation."
CD009786,0,1829343,0,Pelviscopic surgery: a key for conserving fertility.,"As a result of experience with more than 16,000 pelviscopic operative procedures performed at the Kiel University Women's Clinic from 1971 to 1988 which in this time had been adapted and used around the world, it may be said that the pelviscopic operative techniques, based completely on the laparotomy techniques which employ the microscissors, needles and suture material, is superior for many of the classical gynecological indications to operation. Minimally invasive surgery reduces hospitalization for even the most difficult cases to approximately 3 days. Convalescence is also reduced to approximately 1 week. Postoperative complaints are few, particularly when the primary exudate is removed through an abdominal drain. Late complications are practically unknown. It must be said that even the most minimal of operative procedures can produce late postoperative complaints or can be ascribed as the source of late postoperative complaints. Experiences gathered from around the world with endoscopically guided intraabdominal surgery have shown that for some gynecological procedures laparotomy is now indicated only in the rare case. The leading example of this switch can be seen in the operative treatment of the ectopic pregnancy. Following closely are operations to correct sterility such as salpingolysis, ovariolysis, fimbrioplasty, and salpingostomy. Finally pelviscopic treatment is increasing for all benign ovarian tumors, and the enucleation of myomas of up to 400 grams in weight. Endoscopically guided intraabdominal surgery also has a place in the field of general abdominal surgery--that of treatment of chronic abdominal adhesions. These procedures in the future should basically commence with endoscopic adhesiolysis, the patient having had the proper preoperative bowel preparation. Because of this minimally invasive technique the surgeon will only rarely be forced to perform laparotomy. In the case of abdominal adhesions a prerequisite for pelviscopic treatment is the visually controlled perforation of the peritoneum. Endoscopic surgery, in contrast to open laparoscopy, has a large periumbilical radius of action and produces no postoperative scars. In Kiel operative pelviscopy has replaced 80% of the classic gynecological laparotomies. The recurrence rate of adhesions is 84% with laparotomy compared with a recurrence rate of less than 40% with postendoscopic adhesiolysis. Forty to sixty percent of the patients who underwent pelviscopic adhesiolysis are complaint-free; this is a result not attained with classical abdominal surgery. Adhesiolysis per laparotomy is now limited to the emergency situation, as in the cases of ileus, for example. Endoscopically guided intraabdominal surgery has now improved the quality of life for surgical patients."

CD009786,0,10952124,0,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus primary debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer.,"Primary surgical cytoreduction followed by chemotherapy usually is the preferred management of advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer. The presence of residual disease after surgery is one of the most important adverse prognostic factors for survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been proposed as an alternative approach to conventional surgery as initial management of bulky ovarian cancer, with the goal of improving surgical quality. Since 1989, we have been treating advanced epithelial ovarian cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead of primary cytoreductive surgery in approximately half of the patients with stage III-IV disease. Selection of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was based on disease-related characteristics (eg, metastatic tumor load, stage of disease, performance status). Since 1993, open laparoscopy also has been used to aid in evaluating operability. A retrospective analysis of 338 patients was conducted to compare outcomes during 1989 to 1998, when neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used, with those observed during 1980 to 1988, when all patients underwent primary cytoreductive surgery. Crude 3-year survival rates were higher and postoperative mortality rates were lower during the second time period compared with the first. Overall, the results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in survival rates in selected patients with advanced ovarian cancer that are comparable with those associated with primary cytoreductive surgery. Patients with stage IV disease, total metastatic tumor load greater than 1,000 g, uncountable plaque-shaped peritoneal metastases, and/or a poor performance status are probably the best candidates for this alternative approach. A prospective randomized study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and primary cytoreductive surgery is ongoing."

All patients undergo preoperative lab work, imaging studies and bowel preparation prior to surgery. The Davinci surgical system is used to perform urinary cystectomy, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvic adenectomy (including obturator, hypogastic, external iliac, and common iliac lymph nodes). In addition, debulking to less than 1 cm is performed. The anterior pelvic exenteration procedure involves wide perivesical dissection. Then the robot is locked, and ileal conduit is performed via a 6 cm lower midline incision. Operative time can be maintained in 4.6 hours with a mean blood loss of 215 ml and hospital stay of five days. Farghaly's technique of robotic-assisted laparoscopic anterior pelvic exenteration in patients with advanced ovarian cancer is safe, feasible, and cost-effective with acceptable operative, pathological and short- and long-term clinical outcomes. It retains the advantage of minimally invasive surgery."

There is controversy regarding the frequency of the Y-chromosome-derived material and the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in these patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate a large number of patients with UTS, followed before and during the pubertal age for the prevalence of Y-chromosome derived material, the occurrence of gonadoblastoma, and the incidence of possible neoplastic degeneration. An unselected series of 171 patients with UTS (1-34 years old), diagnosed cytogenetically, was studied for Y-chromosome markers (SRY and Y-centromeric DYZ3 repeats). The follow-up was of 2-22 years; 101 of these patients were followed during pubertal age. Y-chromosome material was found in 14 patients (8%): 12 of these were gonadectomized (2.8-25.9 years). A gonadoblastoma was detected in four patients under 16 years of age: in two, Y-material was detected only at molecular analysis (at conventional cytogenetic analysis, one was included in the 45,X group and one in the X + mar group) and one had also an immature teratoma and an endodermal sinus carcinoma. The prevalence of gonadoblastoma in our series of gonadectomized UTS patients with Y-positive material was of 33.3% (4/12). Our data suggest that the age of appearance and the possibility of malignant degeneration of gonadoblastoma can occur early in life. These patients, in particular those with 45,X or a marker chromosome may benefit from molecular screening to detect the presence of Y-chromosome material; PCR is a rapid and inexpensive technique. At the moment, laparoscopy and preventive gonadectomy performed as soon as possible remain the procedures of choice for patients with UTS, when Y-chromosome has been identified, as we are still unable to predict a future malignant evolution of gonadoblastoma."
CD009786,0,6212328,0,[Diagnosis in progressive hirsutism. Catheter technique and results (author's transl)].,"Catheterization of adrenal and ovarian veins in combination with hormone concentration analyses was performed in seventy hirsute women. There was suspicion of tumor in 30 cases because of excess androgen production (plasma testosterone more than 1,5 ng/ml and/or plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate more than 7000 ng/ml in peripheral blood samplings). Catheterization and blood sampling was done with a femoro-visceral catheter by the transfemoral approach. Contributary blood flows from many different venous systems were found to be more often to the right ovarian and to the left adrenal veins in comparisons to the other side. Catheterization of the wrong vessels occurred without being recognized immediately (circumaortic renal collar, inferior phrenic vein, ascending lumbar vein). These pitfalls might falsify blood samplings. There were no significant complications. Seven ovarian tumors were localized. Their size ranged from 0,5 to 2,5 cm in diameter. They were not recognized during laparoscopy. There were 10 hyperthecoses, four adrenogenital syndromes, one abortive testis, one adrenal adenoma, one Cushing's syndrome and one Cushing's disease due to an adenoma of the pituitary gland. In five patients a diagnosis could not be made. Tumor was excluded in forty patients. Their virilization was of adrenal origin in 32%, of ovarian origin in 29%, and of both adrenal and ovarian origin in 22%. In 17% a source of the excess androgen production was not found. This differential diagnosis is not important for the patient therapy."

CD009786,0,161983,0,[The indications for laparoscopy in malignant tumours of the ovary (author's transl)].,"The diagnosis of a malignant ovarian tumour can be made laparoscopically. It is particularly indicated in cases of ascites occurring by itself due to a neoplasm or of undiagnosed origin, and in cases of infiltration of the pelvic nodes or when a small abdominal mass, whether it is isolated or associated with ascites, is found. This particularly of value when a cytological examination of the ascitic fluid does not indicate the diagnosis. Laparoscopy is a means by which the degree of spread of abdomino-pelvic lesions can be discerned in cases where the malignant nature of the ovary is known, but where the prognoses for its removal, either immediately or after several cures with chemotherapy, are doubtful and where the degree of spread has not been correctly and precisely determined at the first surgical intervention. Therefore laparoscopy can complete the information obtained from pelvic examinations and avoid the need for carrying out an exploratory laparotomy, but is gives less information than this latter does about the degree of spread in the pelvis and in the abdomen. So, laparoscopy is a means by which repeated control of the results of therapy which is more thorough than clinical examination can be assured, particularly because it acts as a check on peritoneal cytology. Although its interpretation can be very difficult and its reliability is a relative one, the latter is a good criterion of follow-up."
CD009786,0,7882629,0,Operative laparoscopy in gynaecological oncology.,"Initial reports on the role of laparoscopy in gynaecological malignancies have centred around staging procedures. Laparoscopic lymphadenectomy, both pelvic and para-aortic, appears to be feasible and adequate. It appears that laparoscopy may play an important role in reviving the radical vaginal hysterectomy for patients with early cervical cancer. Similarly, an abdominal incision may be avoided in patients with early endometrial carcinoma by employing laparoscopic staging with vaginal hysterectomy. The role laparoscopy will play in ovarian cancer is still to be defined, and laparoscopic advocates must be cautious in this subset of patients. However, for those gynaecological oncologists employing second-look procedures, it appears that beginning with laparoscopy may make laparotomy unnecessary in the majority of patients. Survival data for patients with gynaecological malignancies managed using laparoscopy in lieu of laparotomy are still lacking. It is imperative that survival is not compromised by employing a new surgical technique. Cost data comparing laparoscopy to laparotomy in our subspeciality is unavailable. This increasingly important aspect of medical care may influence the future of laparoscopy. These and other important issues need to be addressed by future trials before the role of laparoscopy in gynaecological oncology can be determined."

We report on a patient with BOT with early recurrence and high-grade carcinoma transformation in a short interval after complete laparoscopic staging. A 27-year-old unmarried woman presented with a 26 cm in size ruptured left ovarian mass. Laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy with right ovarian biopsies, multiple peritoneal biopsies, omental biopsy and washing cytology were performed. FIGO Stage I ovarian serous borderline tumor with microinvasion was confirmed.

From experimental data, the laparoscopic treatment of gynecologic cancer has potential advantages and disadvantages. The risk of dissemination appears high when a large number of malignant cells are present so that adnexal tumors with external vegetations, and bulky lymph nodes may be considered as contra-indications to CO2 laparoscopy. Laparoscopic surgery has become the gold standard in the treatment of benign adnexal tumeurs, whereas laparotomy remains the standard for the treatment of malignant tumors. The surgical diagnosis is the key to adequate management of adnexal tumeurs. In our experience, after a careful preoperative evaluation, the laparoscopic diagnosis of malignancy is reliable. Moreover in national surveys, many malignant tumeurs were considered as benign despite suspicious laparoscopic findings. Using strict guidelines, laparoscopic diagnosis can be proposed for both non suspicious and complex tumeurs, thus avoiding many unnecessary laparotomies for benign tumeurs suspicious at ultrasound. The more controversial limits of laparoscopic treatment are discussed. If a laparotomy was performed for all tumeurs suspicious at surgery, 80% of the cases would be treated by laparoscopy.

Our literature search revealed 19 reported cases of neonatal ovarian cysts resulting in bowel obstruction. Infants may present with a palpable abdominal mass, respiratory distress, as well as signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Two mechanisms exist for bowel obstruction: adhesions caused by a torsed necrotic ovary and mass effect of a large ovarian cyst, often measuring 9 to 10 cm in diameter.

The current standard treatment for ovarian cancer consists of maximum cytoreductive surgery to reduce tumor residuum to a minimum, followed by platin-based chemotherapy. If an unsuspected ovarian cancer is detected at diagnostic laparoscopy, staging and debulking by laparotomy should be undertaken without delay. For apparently early stages (I or II), appropriate surgical staging is extremely important and will result in the upstaging of about one-third of patients (usually to Stage III). Several retrospective clinical trials show that successful cytoreduction and systemic lymphonodectomy result in an improved survival, but prospective randomized studies have not been performed to evaluate this benefit. Patients who cannot initially be cytoreduced to an optimal stage should be considered candidates for interval cytoreduction after chemotherapy. Repeated surgical debulking in relapsed patients will probably only benefit a small subset of selected patients (e.g. disease-free interval > 2 years). Surgery may also be important for palliation, such as for the treatment of bowel obstruction to improve the patients quality of life. The question still remains whether the observed improved survival rates for patients with ovarian cancer are an effect of primary cytoreductive surgery or tumor biology."

Therapeutic laparoscopy was performed in 3 cases: transposition of an ovary before radiotherapy, bilateral gonadal excision for Turner's syndrome and ovarian fixation after contralateral torsion of normal adnexa (TNA). Diagnostic and potentially therapeutic laparoscopy was performed in 25 cases: 12 suspected torsion of adnexa (6 confirmed), 4 possible ovarian or appendicular pathology (1 appendicitis), 4 to confirm the histological nature of an ovarian tumor (2 functional cysts, 1 old TNA, 1 dermoid cyst), 3 suspected salpingitis (2 confirmed), and 2 chronic pelvic pain (1 endometriosis). No pathology was found in 2 cases, and in 1 case pelvic adhesions prevented confirmation of the diagnosis. Thirteen laparoscopically-guided surgical acts were performed: 2 detorsions of adnexa, 2 excisions of necrosed adnexa and 9 punctures with or without biopsy for functional cysts. Intralaparoscopic detorsion of TNA was complicated in one case by fibrinolysis requiring secondary laparotomy. Mean hospitalisation was 3 days (range 1 to 16). the preferential therapeutic indications for laparoscopy in the child are transposition of an ovary and ablation of the gonads in case of sexual ambiguity. It is used diagnostically in cases of sudden pelvic pain. In addition to this diagnostic role, it now allows most treatments to be carried out (detorsion with or without fixation, transparietal cystectomy), including those for associated lesions (appendicectomy).

CD009786,0,12807227,0,Reflections on the FIGO surgical staging of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer.,"The main aims and requirements of any staging system are: to determine the anatomical extent of disease, to allow uniform reporting of treatment results, comparison of their efficacy and pooling of data from various institutions. It should be based on the mode of spread of the neoplasm, take into consideration prognostic risk factors and be of prognostic value. A critical review of the FIGO staging system for ovarian carcinoma indicates that these aims and requirements are not entirely fulfilled. Following are some examples. It does not include exact recommendations for comprehensive surgical staging in apparently early ovarian cancer and staging is therefore not performed uniformly. The presence of parenchymal liver and lung metastasis may be facilitated by modern imaging devices. However, according to FIGO rules only simple X-ray procedures are allowed preoperatively. The correlation between increasing stage and survival is inconsistent and sometimes contrary to that expected. Many known prognostic factors are not included in the present staging system. Although the aims of data pooling and of uniform reporting of treatment results have been achieved, the validity of some comparisons are questionable in view of the variations in staging. The intent of this review was not to belittle the major contribution of staging to research, understanding and management of ovarian carcinoma, but to highlight its deficiencies. New data have accumulated since the FIGO staging system of ovarian carcinoma has been adopted and should prompt consideration of modifications such as incorporation of modern diagnostic procedures and of some established prognostic markers and reshuffling of certain substages."
CD009786,0,9118426,0,Intralaparoscopic ultrasound and Doppler sonography in urology.,"Common practice with intraoperative sonography during open surgery has demonstrated that ultrasounds supply important information that can help the urologist in decision making; in addition, the growing popularity of laparoscopy has underscored the importance of laparoscopic ultrasonography. Laparoscopic ultrasound combines the advantage of diagnostic laparoscopy and intraoperative contact ultrasonography. The authors report their experience with intralaparoscopic ultrasonography using a 7.5-MHz transesophageal probe in several paradigmatic urologic applications, in which intraoperative ultrasonography was employed to provide anatomical information, to supply efficiency in confirming and excluding anticipated or unexpected pathology, and to solve diagnostic problems using high-resolution, real-time, B-mode ultrasound. Intralaparoscopic ultrasound proves to be a simple, efficient procedure that provides useful information in order to help the urologist in intraoperative decision making."

Fourteen patients underwent laparoscopic removal of such tumours. There were no operative complications. Post-operative hospitalization was short (average: 2 days). All patients undergoing a second-look laparoscopy had mild adhesions around the operated ovary. Two spontaneous and one in-vitro fertilization pregnancy occurred. If a teratoma is diagnosed during laparoscopy or oocyte retrieval, it should be promptly removed as malignant transformation is not excluded. In this case, the embryos should be frozen for later transfer."
CD009786,0,21793996,0,Primary transitional cell carcinoma of the fallopian tube.,"The fallopian tube is the least common site for origin of malignancy in the female genital tract. Most primary fallopian tube malignancies are adenocarcinomas. Primary transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the fallopian tube is an extremely rare tumor with a small number of cases reported in the literature. We present a 67-year-old woman who was found incidentally to have a left adnexal mass on a screening pelvic ultrasound. Subsequently the patient underwent laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy and the specimen was submitted for intraoperative frozen section, which revealed a high-grade carcinoma; therefore, she underwent a laparotomy and total abdominal hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy. Histopathology revealed high-grade transitional cell carcinoma in the left fallopian tube. Post-surgery she was treated with four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel with no complications. Our patient had a family history of malignancy, so genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was undertaken and did not reveal any mutation or unclassified variants. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was normal."
CD009786,0,9876656,0,Endoscopic management of adnexal masses.,"The laparoscopic management of suspicious adnexal masses and early ovarian malignancies is discussed with the aim of maintaining accepted oncologic treatment principles. Comparative survival data of patients with gynecological malignancies managed by laparoscopy or laparotomy are still very scarce and the survival of cancer patients must not be compromised by new techniques. It is time to closely analyze laparoscopy and determine if it has a positive impact on the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian malignancies. In this paper we will address the following points: 1) Which ovarian cysts can be surgically treated by laparoscopy (pelviscopy)? 2) Is staging laparoscopy an accepted technique? 3) Is laparoscopy, as a second-look procedure, of benefit? 4) Is laparoscopic staging, together with histologic tissue sampling, adequate surgical technique in inoperable ovarian cancer with ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis? 5) Does endoscopic biopsy of ovarian cancer stage Ia change the destiny of a patient into ovarian cancer Ic?"

In both patients, CT scan revealed the presence of an heterogeneous nodular lesion inside the left oblique muscle. Histologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of port-site recurrence."
CD009786,0,17484640,0,Indications for hand-assisted laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors.,"Radiofrequency ablation has established itself as the preferred treatment for irresectable liver tumors. It can be performed either percutaneously, laparoscopically, or by open surgery. The choice of approach depends on the patient and tumor-related variables. The laparoscopic approach appears to be the safest and most effective method for small tumors on the liver surface. It also provides additional information on the intrahepatic tumor burden with the use of intraoperative ultrasound and staging laparoscopy. Furthermore, the pneumoperitoneum reduces the flow of the portal vein and increases the efficacy of the ablation. Depending on the location of the tumor, mobilization of the liver or lysis of adhesions from previous surgery can require open surgery. Our aim was to study the combined use of laparoscopy and laparotomy by using hand-assisted laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation."

CD009786,0,11918456,0,Elevated serum cancer antigen 125 levels in advanced abdominal tuberculosis.,"A 48-yr-old female presented with a 1-yr history of pain in the hypochondrium and epigastrium. All routine investigations and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen were done. CT findings revealed a well-defined cystic mass in the right ovary, and ascitis with features suggestive of secondaries over the omentum and peritoneal surface. The serum CA125 was 1255 U/mL (normal range 0-35 U/mL), which was indicative of ovarian malignancy. An exploratory laparotomy was performed. Histopathological examination of organs revealed the presence of granuloma. The patient was advised to undergo antitubercular treatment (ATT) and follow-up every month. After 1 mo of ATT, the CA125 level came down to 42 U/mL, which was near normal. As tuberculosis requires only a conservative management, we suggest that in cases of abdominopelvic mass with or without ascitis, high serum CA125 should always raise a suspicion of tuberculosis and a laparoscopy combined with peritoneal biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This will prevent unnecessary laparotomies. Moreover, serum CA125 can be used to monitor the response of disease to antitubercular treatment."

These combinations were high-dose methotrexate-leucovorin plus cyclophosphamide (MECY) or cyclophosphamide, hexamethylmelamine, doxorubicin, and DDP (CHAD). Patients with no clinically measurable disease after 6 months of therapy were evaluated by laparoscopy. In the absence of disease progression at the time of the laparoscopy the study design called for a repeat cycle of four weekly DDP courses and another five monthly courses of the assigned multidrug combination. All patients with no evidence of disease after 1 year of treatment had a second-look laparoscopy which, if negative, was followed by a second-look laparotomy. This report includes all of the consecutively entered patients observed for a minimum of 1 year or to death. DDP-MECY and DDP-CHAD were similarly active for overall response rates and complete response rates according to laparoscopic criteria. However, DDP-MECY had a statistically significantly lower relapse rate (P less than 0.02) and a statistically significantly higher negative second-look laparotomy rate than did DDP-CHAD. Using all entered patients, with no exclusions from analysis, eight of 17 patients (47%) treated with DDP-MECY had negative second-looks after 1 year of treatment. This compares with one of 16 (6%) negative second-looks in patients treated with DDP-CHAD (P less than 0.02). The high negative second-look rate with DDP-MECY is exciting. Positive cytologic washings at the 6-month laparoscopic evaluation were highly predictive that residual disease would be found at the 1-year second-look surgery. Only one patient with positive peritoneal cytology after 6 months of treatment was found to have a negative second-look after 1 year of therapy."

CD009786,0,7660384,0,Follow-up laparoscopy in patients with ovarian cancer.,"Between 1982 and 1990, two hundred and fourteen consecutive laparoscopies were performed on 75 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer when the disease appeared to be clinically in complete remission according to simultaneous CT scan or ultrasonography. Evaluation were based on macroscopic findings through the laparoscope, by cytologic examination of ascitic and peritoneal washings and by intraperitoneal biopsy. The results were positive in 34 laparoscopies for 19 patients, suspicious in 15 laparoscopies for 13 patients and negative in 164 laparoscopies. the intraperitoneal recurrence rate after negative second-look laparoscopy was 14.0% as a whole, and 4.5% in cases with more than two consecutive negative evaluations. Serum CA-125 levels exhibited and elevation in 28 of 34 positive laparoscopies before treatment and remained within the normal range in 22 (78.6%) of the 28 cases after treatment despite positive follow-up laparoscopies. The repeated laparoscopies offer the advantage of lowering the false negative rate.

CD009786,0,16398230,0,Management of ovarian cysts in pregnancy: a case report.,"According to recent epidemiological studies on ovarian cysts during pregnancy one out of 600 are, in most cases, benign neoformations. The most frequent histological type reported is mature cystic teratoma (50% of the cases), followed by functional cysts (13%), benign cystadenomas (20%) and ovarian cancer (0.6%). Most adnexal masses are asymptomatic and spontaneously resolve before the 16th week of amenorrhoea. On the other hand, some cases are persistent forms which can cause complications for the mother and fetus. The objective of this work was to review the existing literature from an epidemiological point of view, with an emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic management. We have paid particular attention in our review to the use of diagnostic techniques and non surgical therapies such as laparoscopy, which in expert hands and adopting particular skills, can be considered as on approach to ovarian cysts in pregnancy. We present the case of a patient with an ovarian cyst during pregnancy that was a successfully treated with laparoscopy."
CD009786,0,15754994,0,Possibilities and limitation of endoscopic procedures in oncological gynaecology.,"In cases of gynaecological cancer, the use of endoscopic techniques, in spite of becoming more frequent, is very controversial. Mainly, the potential risk of dissemination, which worsens the patient prognosis and leads to consequent adjuvant therapy is of concern. Based on data from the literature the authors present the advantages and disadvantages of using hysteroscopy in patients suffering from endometrial malignancy. According to the references and personal experience, the diagnostic and therapeutic value of laparoscopy in cases of cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancer are discussed."
CD009786,0,12959184,0,Surgical advances in the treatment of ovarian cancer.,"Surgical intervention remains a key component in the diagnosis and management of epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Although the parameters defining ""optimal"" tumor cytoreduction continue to evolve, data validate the concept of complete operative tumor resection to no visible residual disease in all stages of ovarian cancer to prolong disease-free and overall survival. In select patients, recurrent disease also may be managed with surgical cytoreduction. At the other end of the spectrum, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy has been shown conclusively to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women at high risk. Although BRCA1-associated and BRCA2-associated gynecologic cancer syndromes do not seem to include uterine malignancies, the role of hysterectomy to remove the fallopian tube completely is controversial. Finally, new data support the concept of conservative, fertility-sparing surgery in a select group of women with early-stage disease. Although laparoscopy may be feasible in staging women with disease apparently limited to an ovary, further studies are necessary before it can be considered routinely as an alternative to standard laparotomy."

Fourteen of 37 evaluable patients had recieved previous treatment. Three of these 14 previously treated patients responded; no complete remissions were achieved and more severe toxicity was seen compared with the 23 previously untreated patients. In the latter group of patients, seven partial remissions and five complete remissions documented by peritoneoscopy and laparotomy were achieved. It is concluded that the combination of hexamethylmelamine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil is not useful as second-line chemotherapy but can be considered suitable for remission induction in previously untreated patients."
CD009786,0,9989103,0,The impact of laparoscopic surgery in the management of adnexal masses.,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical aspects of laparoscopic management of adnexal masses. The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated, but the safe and effective use of laparoscopy for this indication requires training, technical skills and experience on the part of the laparoscopist. If used appropriately, many patients will benefit from minimally-invasive surgery. We compared clinical factors of patients having laparoscopy to those having laparotomy in a case-control study of 30 patients with adnexal masses. Oophorectomy or ovarian cystectomy was performed by laparoscopy for 20 women and by laparotomy for 10 women. Comparing the 2 groups, the most significant difference was the decrease in length of hospital stay in the laparoscopy group. There were no significant differences in operative time or intraoperative complications. Estimated blood loss was lower in the laparoscopy group, and no intraoperative complications occurred. No patient required conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy. All patients had benign disease despite the inclusion of patients with risk factors for ovarian carcinoma. This study clearly demonstrates the clinical benefits of laparoscopic management of adnexal masses treated with oophorectomy or ovarian cystectomy."

Without the primary site of a neoplasm it is often difficult to establish the prognosis and a treatment regimen. In PC the most frequent primitive tumors are ovarian neoplasms in women and gastrointestinal neoplasms in men. We present a case report of a 70-year-old Caucasian woman who was referred to our department for diagnosis and management of a PC. A fine-catheter aspiration cytology of the peritoneal implants was performed and provided histologic evidence of an ovarian papillary type carcinoma. This case is suggestive of what has been called in recent literature extraovarian peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma. Absent or insignificant histology of the ovaries of primary in-situ ovarian carcinoma is one diagnostic criterion. This patient had no evidence of ovarian disease considering ultrasound imaging and computer tomography.

CD009786,0,20873867,0,Novel surgical approaches for sampling the ovarian surface epithelium and proximal fluid proteome.,"The pathogenesis of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers has been difficult to elucidate despite intense effort. Recently, though, the care of women felt to be at high risk due to a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer or a known germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has provided potential insight into the development of these malignancies. Risk-reducing surgical removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries, called risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy (RRBSO), is commonly performed as a laparoscopic procedure to minimize recovery time. We describe here an optimized surgical sampling workflow for analyzing the proteomes of peritoneal, fallopian tube, and ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) specimens collected at the time of laparoscopic RRBSO, a technique which has not been described previously. This methodology presents a unique opportunity for closer examination of the proteomic alterations in the tissues at risk for malignant transformation in women with an inherited susceptibility to ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer development."

In a large phase III trial ovarian cancer patients in complete clinical remission with FIGO stage Ic-IV were randomized between standard treatment plus a single IP (90)Y-labeled muHMFG1 versus standard treatment alone after negative second-look laparoscopy. Case report forms of all patients with disease recurrence were reviewed to determine site and date of recurrent disease. In total 447 patients were included in the study with a median follow-up of 3.5 years. Relapse was seen in 104/224 in the active and 98/223 in the control arm. Significantly fewer IP (p < 0.05) and more extraperitoneal (p < 0.05) relapses occurred in the active treatment arm. Time to IP recurrence was significantly longer (p = 0.0019) and time to extraperitoneal recurrence was significantly shorter for the active treatment arm (p < 0.001). The impact of IP radioimmunotherapy on IP relapse-free survival could only be seen in the subgroup of patients with residual disease after primary surgery (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.53; p = 0.002). Although, there is no survival benefit for IP radioimmunotherapy as consolidation treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer, we found an improved control of IP disease, that was offset by increased extraperitoneal recurrences."

CD009786,0,7855346,0,From the archives of the AFIP. Ovarian epithelial neoplasms: radiologic-pathologic correlation.,"Ovarian carcinoma is the most common cause of death from a gynecologic malignant neoplasm. The typically advanced stage at presentation and aggressive nature of these neoplasms result in an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 40%. Most malignant ovarian neoplasms are of the surface epithelial cell type, which includes serous, mucinous, clear cell, endometrioid, and Brenner tumors. However, among the epithelial neoplasms, benign lesions are more common than malignant neoplasms, and other entities (including nonneoplastic masses) are far more common causes of a pelvic mass. Imaging studies (ultra-sound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) can depict the tumor morphology: solid or cystic, unilocular or multilocular cystic, with or without thickening of the walls or septa, with or without papillary excrescences or other soft-tissue elements, and with or without calcifications. Evaluation of these morphologic characteristics allows attempted differentiation among malignant, benign neoplastic, and nonneoplastic lesions. Lesion characterization assists in surgical planning. Malignant neoplasms nearly always require laparotomy, whereas benign neoplasms may be managed laparoscopically. In the case of ovarian carcinoma, treatment is primarily surgical, and most patients also receive chemotherapy. Unfortunately, recurrence is common."

CD009786,0,14515055,0,[Functional ovarian cysts in girls].,"Ovarian masses may result from functional (nonneoplastic) cysts or benign or malignant neoplasms. In 1973, the World Health Organisation classified ovarian neoplasms into nine major categories and 26 subtypes, based on histologic cell type and benign versus malignant state. The literature review concerning functional ovarian cysts in girls has been presented. Functional cysts are not true neoplasms but rather should be considered a variation of a normal physiologic process. Functional cyst include follicular, corpus luteum, and theca-lutein types, all of which are benign and usually self-limited. The incidence of functional cysts in the community is probably even higher than indicated in most series, as percentages are based on referred cases and it is not possible to determine the underlying incidence of nonidentified or asymptomatic cysts. Incidence, etiopathogenesis, clinical symptoms, methods of diagnostics, treatment and results of functional cysts in fetus and newborns, in children and adolescents are discussed."

CD009786,0,11056130,0,Successful transfer of frozen-thawed embryos obtained immediately before radical surgery for stage IIIa serous borderline ovarian tumour: case report.,"A stage IIIA borderline serous ovarian tumour was treated conservatively by laparoscopy to preserve the fertility of a 21 year old nulligravid woman. Six months later, recurrent lesions were resected. An 'urgent' IVF was performed to obtain frozen embryos. Oncological treatment was then completed by radical surgery with uterine conservation. Fifteen months later, two thawed embryos were successfully transferred and the patient delivered one baby. From this observation, the authors discuss an alternative to oocyte donation in cases of bilateral ovariectomy for stage IIIA borderline serous ovarian tumour."

There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications and postoperative recovery was rapid with all patients having function of the colostomy within 24 hrs and regaining their preoperative state of mobility on the second postoperative day. The laparoscopic approach allows the careful selection of the colostomy site, easy mobilisation of the colon, causing only little disruption to the intestinal function hence improving postoperative recovery. From Authors' experience, laparoscopic colostomy is a simple and safe operation in most cases and can be used as the preferred technique of intestinal diversion."
CD009786,0,21362294,0,Endometriosis coexisting with dermoid cyst in a single ovary: a case report.,"Endometriosis coexisting with a dermoid cyst of the ovary is extraordinarily rare, although both these benign conditions are said to be common in women in the reproductive age group. There are only two previous case reports,which is evident from our literature review from January 1960 through January 2010. Acute abdomen is one of the greatest diagnostic challenges and easily ignored by the clinicians to exclude the possibility of gynecologic illness. A 35-year-old woman was referred by the doctor in Family clinic. She experienced a three-day period of severe right lower abdominal pain and intermittent vomiting. Ultrasonography identified a bilocular, cystic, hypoechoic, and hyperechoic tumor, 7 cm × 6 cm × 6 cm in the right adnexal region. Laparoscopic cystectomy was performed under the impression of ovarian cyst with torsion or hemorrhage. The frozen section was benign and appendiceal status was adequate. Histopathologic examination described an ovarian cyst composed of endometrial-type lining with stromacells (endometriosis) and benign teratoma tissue with plenty of skin appendages and sebaceous glands. We report this unusual and interesting ovarian mass to remind physicians that the usage of the Endobag after cystectomy, the benefits on minimizing operative time, spilled opportunity, and postoperative complications. Laparoscopic techniques for large ovarian masses might be considered. The experience of the surgeon is also very important to prevent misdiagnosis or complication. Further follow up is mandatory for this simultaneous finding of ovarian endometriosis with coincidental dermoid cyst as a separate pathology in single ovary of such a nature. It also presents a challenge to the clinicians and to the pathologists."
CD009786,0,11977327,0,Diagnostic value of US and CT in the assessment of ovarian teratomas and their qualifications for surgical treatment with laparoscopic method.,"In the group of 17 women after surgery with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of teratomas diagnostic usefulness of US and CT was analysed. Differentiated echostructure of tumours was correlated with different densities of pathologic tissues in CT examination, also after their contrast enhancement. In 2 patients teratomas of both ovaries were recognised, in the remaining 15 women tumours were unilateral. In total morphologic pictures of 19 teratomas were assessed, 9 times tumours with prevailing liquid component had the picture of a thick-walled cyst, 7 times these were hyperechogenic fatty foci and in 3 cases had the character of solid tumours. Teratomas had different morphologic pictures, but it was possible to show the prevalence of one element and classify the tumour to one of the three types of teratomas. It was found that US examination, due to its high frequency, lets early diagnose teratomas before they are accessible in the clinical exam, in the symptomless period or when they give indirect symptoms, usually dysuric ones. CT examination, due to its high sensitivity in recognising fatty tissue and calcifications, is necessary before laparoscopic operation requiring fragmentation of big tumours to determine their character."

There were found cysts of the both ovaries, which were conservative treated by insistence of the patient for three months. After unsuccessful gestagenic therapy there was performed a gynecological laparoscopy, which showed that on one of the ovaries there was an exophyte growths suspected for carcinoma tissue. It was offered an emergency operation, which was made only after 1,5 months because of personal causes of the patient. It was taken a sample that was with unconvincing data for ovarian cancer. The clinical experience and professionalism of the surgical team were put on the test. It was performed a radical operation with removal of the uterus, adnexa uteri, partial peritoneoectomy, total lymph dissection, appendectomy, total omentectomy.

These patients are, however, often diagnosed when evaluated for primary amenorrhea. We report the case of FS in a pre-menarchal girl at the age of 6 years. Ultrasound examinations were performed and were inconclusive as to the presence or size of the gonads. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and the presence of bilateral streak gonads was documented and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histological examination of the streak gonads confirmed the presence of gonadoblastoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature of a pre-menarchal patient diagnosed with FS and a laparoscopic bilateral gonadoblastoma resection. Laparoscopic aspects regarding safe streak gonad removal in the pediatric population have been elaborated."

After ultrasonography and determination of tumor markers, a right huge benign adnexal mass was suspected. In order to avoid exploratory laparotomy because severe pain and a large operative scar were expected, an operative laparoscopy was performed. No intra-operative and post-operative complications were observed. With the uneventful recovery, only a one-day hospital stay was needed. Neither residual nor recurrent evidence was suspected after 2-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months follow-up. With proper case selection, good pre-operative counseling and the operation performed under familiarity and good training in laparoscopy, laparoscopic management of a huge suspected benign adnexal mass is technically feasible. The benefits are reducing hospital stay, lowering morbidity, especially less pain and cosmetic acceptance of the operative scar."

Clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal tuberculosis are non-specific and compatible with pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, advanced ovarian cancer, deep mycosis, yersinia infection and amebomas. Abdominal form is located at 6th place of the extrapulmonary forms, after lymphatic, genitourinary, osteoarticular, miliary and meningeal infections. Eventually, 25 to 75% of patients with abdominal tuberculosis will require surgery. These procedures should be limitated with the purpose to preserve small bowel. Resection should be limitated for complicated cases. The surgical indications include: Intestinal occlusion (15-60%), perforation (1-15%), abscesses and fistulas (2-30%) and hemorrhage (2%)."

Gynecologic problems included infertility, suspected endometriosis and/or pelvic adhesions, ovarian cysts, and second-look laparoscopy after treatment for ovarian cancer. The technique was evaluated in regard to ease of performance in patients with various abdominal incisions. Conventional instrumentation was used. No significant side effects were experienced and anesthesia time was prolonged by no more than 10 to 20 minutes in most cases. Significant subincisional adhesions were found in 35% of patients.

Forty-nine ovaries in 25 consecutive infertility patients undergoing microlaser surgery for deep ovarian endometriosis or polycystic ovarian disease, refractory to medical treatment, were evaluated from October 1981 through March 1983. All patients subsequently underwent a second-look nonlaser laparoscopy to evaluate the extent of healing and to bluntly lyse any subsequent adhesions with the Olympus laparoscope (Olympus Corporation, Lake Success, NY) second-puncture probe: 36.7% of the ovaries had recurring adhesions, 83.3% of these adhesions were mild and filmy and 16.7% were moderate and dense. Additionally, four ovaries were viewed approximately 1 year postoperatively, with two ovaries that previously had mild and filmy adhesions lysed at 6 weeks having no recurrent adhesions. The actual pregnancy rate in this study is 60%, with 15 of the 25 patients conceiving at least once and 2 patients conceiving twice. The majority of pregnancies occurred within the first 6 months postoperatively, with the longest initial pregnancy occurring 22 months postoperatively. Thus, microlaser ovarian surgery, coupled with early second-look laparoscopy, appears efficacious in minimizing adhesion reformation and seems to have little adverse effect on subsequent conception."

Histology findings, age, tumor size, bilaterality and malignity of these 620 cases were analyzed. The histologic differentiation yielded 604 (17.3%) mature teratomas (dermoid cysts), 15 monodermale and 1 immature teratoma. Division of total period in the time before and after 1990-since then we have got the possibility of laparoscopic operation-reveals that presumably by increasing use of ultrasound a decrease in mean age at time of diagnosis from 40.2 +/- 20 to 30.7 +/- 12 as well as in tumor size (9 +/- 4 resp. 4 +/- 2 cm) has been achieved. A secondary malignant transformation of epithelial component has been found in 0.5% (3/604) and bilaterality in 11% of the cases. With regard to general rules of laparoscopic operations the intact dermoid cyst enucleation is recommended in premenopausal and extirpation in postmenopausal women.

CD009786,0,22371368,0,Laparoscopic management of large ovarian cysts.,"The aim of this study was to describe a new technique for laparoscopic removal of large ovarian cystic masses. The authors performed a retrospective study during the period January 2008 to December 2009 in the Second Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Aretaieion University Hospital; 19 women with large ovarian cysts were included in the study. During the study period, 53 women underwent laparoscopic excision of ovarian cysts. Among them, 19 had very large complex ovarian cysts with a mean diameter of 8.4 cm. The mean age of the patients was 32.1 years. Ultrasound examination revealed findings suggestive of benign disease in all patients. In 8 out of 19 patients CA-125 levels were elevated, ranging from 40.5 to 194.7 IU/mL. A 5-mm suprapubic trocar was directly inserted into the cyst and fluid contents aspirated, so the decompressed cyst could fit in a 5-cm laparoscopic bag. The cyst wall was carefully detached from the healthy ovarian tissue and placed in the bag without any spillage. The remaining cyst wall was removed from the peritoneal cavity with the laparoscopic bag. The mean operative time was 45 minutes. No operative or postoperative complications were noted. There was no conversion to laparotomy. Mean hospital stay was 1 day. Pathology revealed 7 endometriomas, 3 mucinous cystadenomas, 3 serous cystadenomas, 3 serous cysts, and 3 teratomas. Direct trocar insertion within the ovarian cyst followed by aspiration of the fluid contents is a safe and feasible method for the laparoscopic management of large ovarian cysts."

A 30-year-old woman underwent excision of a right submandibular adenoid cystic carcinoma followed by regional external beam radiation therapy. Three years later, she underwent extended hepatic resection and localized radiotherapy to the hepatic region for metastatic disease. The patient was without evidence of disease for 7 years when she developed pelvic pain and a pelvic mass was found. A solid and cystic 10-cm left ovarian mass and a single metastatic tumor nodule involving the right ovary were excised via the laparoscope. Histologically, the tumor was identical to the patient's initial salivary gland neoplasm. The neoplastic cells were CAM 5.2 positive, S100 positive, muscle-specific actin positive, and smooth muscle actin positive. Ultrastructurally, characteristic pseudocysts (pseudolumina) with abundant basal lamina and true glandular lumina lined by short microvilli were present. Other than a single anecdotal account of a parotid gland adenoid cystic carcinoma, this case represents the first documented report of an adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary gland origin that was associated with symptomatic ovarian metastases. This case demonstrates that the ovary is a potential site for metastatic disease many years following the diagnosis and treatment for a primary neoplasm however uncommon or remote the site of origin. Since metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma can rarely present as an ovarian mass, a clinical history of this neoplasm should be heavily weighed in the differential diagnosis of any unusual ovarian tumor with a predominant cribriform, trabecular, or tubular pattern."

Eighteen patients had complete surgical staging defined as total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and aortic node sampling, omentectomy, and cytology. Eight patients had all of the above with the exception of node sampling. The overall median follow-up for the group is 43+ months. Three patients had grade 1 tumors with positive washings or capsule invasion and are disease free with a median follow-up of 53+ months. Of 23 patients with grade 2-3 tumors, 22 are alive and free of disease with a median follow-up of 42+ months. There has been 1 recurrence, at 18 months, in a patient who had complete staging and a grade 2 tumor. The patient recurred with carcinomatosis, documented by laparoscopy.

It is attractive to continue treatment of these patients with intraperitoneal (ip) delivered chemotherapy. From 1981 through 1984 a Tenckhoff catheter was implanted in 59 women for ip chemotherapy after a staging laparoscopy or laparotomy. Minor complications occurred in 8 patients and could be treated conservatively. Ten patients suffered major complications, leading to three (re)laparotomies and catheter extraction in 7 of 10 patients. No patient died of complications, but mean hospitalization time of patients with major complications was 25 days as compared to 11 days for patients without complications. An analysis of nine factors that could lead to postoperative complications failed to reveal a statistically significant risk factor.

CD009786,0,11802556,0,[Laparoscopy and gynecologic cancer: is it still necessary to debate or only convince the incredulous?].,"Many papers suggested that laparoscopic treatment of cancer could be achieved and taught safely. Although cases reports about trocar site metastasis and national survey about inadequate management of early ovarian cancer suggested that laparoscopic management of cancer may be dangerous. The current literature may be summarized as follows. An inadequate surgical management performed by laparoscopy as well as by laparotomy may worsen the prognosis of an early ovarian cancer. If the abdominal wall is protected with a bag and the tumour is not morcellated, the incidence of trocar site site metastasis is about 1%. Animal studies demonstrated that the laparoscopic management of cancer has both advantages and disadvantages. Preliminary results from prospective randomised trials in the treatment of colon cancer suggested that the survival rate is similar after laparoscopy and after laparotomy. The risk of dissemination appears high when a large number of malignant cells are present in patients operated using an increased abdominal pressure and a CO2 pneumoperitoneum. These data suggest that laparoscopic treatment of gynaecologic cancer is not dangerous if an adequate surgical technique is used. However morcellation of suspicious solid tumours, treatment of adnexal tumours with external vegetations but without peritoneal dissemination and of bulky lymph nodes should be considered as contra-indications to CO2 laparoscopy, puncture of an ovarian tumour with intracystic vegetations is a high risk situation which should be avoided whenever possible."

Three patients with clinical presumptive stage IA GCT of the ovary were initially treated with conservative laparoscopic surgery with intraoperative rupture of the tumor. On repeat surgical exploration, all 3 patients were found to have peritoneal disease. Postoperative chemotherapy was required. Several important aspects of laparoscopic management of adnexal masses are highlighted by these 3 case reports. A thorough knowledge about GCT is important.

CD009786,0,8015759,0,Management of early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer.,"Because ovarian cancer is asymptomatic until the late stages of the disease and because accurate methods of early detection are lacking, only about 40% of these cancers present in stages I and II. As a result, ovarian carcinoma remains the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy in the United States. However, proper management of early cases may lead to a good prognosis for long-term survival and, in some cases, may even permit preservation of reproductive capacity. The appropriate management of these early cases includes meticulous and thorough staging at the time of the initial surgery. In women who do not desire further reproduction, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be carried out. In those who eagerly wish to maintain reproductive potential, the uterus and contralateral ovary may be preserved, providing certain criteria have been met. Patients with stage Ia or Ib grade 1 disease can be followed-up without further therapy after definitive surgery; those with Ic or grade 3 tumors should receive adjuvant therapy. Patients with stage I epithelial ovarian cancer who are without evidence of disease after comprehensive staging surgery and primary adjuvant chemotherapy do not require second-look laparotomy. In the future, laparoscopy will play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and management of early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer."

On retrospective review of the CT pelvis after surgery, the radiologist could still not diagnose the ovarian lesion separated from the primary rectal tumor due to their close proximity. However, on EUS we were able to clearly see on real-time imaging that there was a distinct peri-rectal mass apart from the primary rectal tumor."
CD009786,0,15630884,0,[The role of laparoscopy in ovarian carcinoma].,"Diagnostic laparoscopy is a standard in the surgical management of adnexal masses, and is a tool in the diagnosis of early ovarian cancers. On the other hand, there are a lot of limitations to the use of laparoscopic surgery in the management of early ovarian cancer, and open surgery remains a standard. Laparoscopic surgery is used in there assessment of inadequately staged apparently early ovarian cancers. In the case of obviously advanced ovarian cancer, laparoscopic examination may help to decide whether to propose upfront surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Laparoscopy may also be used in the follow up of previously treated patients. Prophylactic oophorectomy is routinely performed using laparoscopic surgery."
CD009786,0,6908877,0,[Bilateral ovarian carcinoma during pregnancy (author's transl)].,A case of bilateral ovarian carcinoma during pregnancy is reported. The diagnosis was obtained at 18 weeks gestation by laparoscopy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with excision of macroscopically evident tumour was carried out.

CD009786,0,7554603,0,The case for laparoscopic management of the adnexal mass.,"Careful patient selection criteria can be used to identify patients who are appropriate for management of an adnexal masses via operative laparoscopy. Proper intraoperative assessment and liberal use of rapid frozen section are also important for optimal clinical outcome. Reported studies show that laparoscopic management of adnexal masses can be safely done. The short hospital stay and rapid return to normal activity combine to potentially reduce the overall cost of patient care. When cancer is unexpectedly found at the time of laparoscopic surgery for an adnexal mass, the surgeon should be prepared to proceed with staging laparotomy for appropriate treatment."

CD009786,0,16787549,0,Managing ovarian masses during pregnancy.,"The management of adnexal masses during pregnancy can be challenging for the patient and the clinician. The specter of a possible malignancy can sway the decision for intervention versus expectant management. The etiologies of ovarian masses are reflective of the patient's age; and, therefore, benign entities such as functional ovarian cysts, benign cystic teratomas, and serous cystadenomas predominate. In the unusual cases when cancer is present, they are typically germ cell and borderline ovarian tumors, and are commonly low stage and low grade. Ultrasound is the primary modality used to detect ovarian masses and to assess the risk of malignancy. Morphologic criteria more accurately identify benign cysts compared with malignant tumors. Tumor markers are used primarily to monitor disease status after treatment rather than establish the ovarian tumor diagnosis as a result of lack of specificity, because several markers can be elevated inherent to the pregnancy itself (eg, CA-125, beta-hCG). Expectant management is recommended for most pregnant patients with asymptomatic, nonsuspicious cystic ovarian masses. Surgical intervention during pregnancy is indicated for large and/or symptomatic tumors and those that appear highly suspicious for malignancy on imaging tests. The extent of surgery depends on the intraoperative diagnosis of a benign versus a malignant tumor. Conservative surgery is appropriate for benign masses and borderline ovarian tumors. More aggressive surgery is indicated for ovarian malignancies, including surgical staging. Although rarely necessary, chemotherapy has been used during pregnancy with minimal fetal toxicity in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer in which the risk of maternal mortality outweighs the fetal consequences."
CD009786,0,10584186,0,Laparoscopy combined with conventional operative techniques.,"In order to establish minimal invasive methods further, it should be guaranteed that laparoscopy is not only performed in a few pediatric surgical centers. A simple approach to gain experience would be the performance of diagnostic laparoscopy. However, benefit could be increased if the surgeon combines the minimal invasive laparoscopy to establish the diagnosis with the conventional surgical technique to continue. This approach for example applies to complicated cases of appendicitis. In a combined procedure, even bowel resections and tumor extirpations can be performed with minimal invasion. In twenty-seven cases--11 appendicectomies, 14 resections of cystic ovarian tumors and 2 resections of Meckel's diverticulum--we applied this technique and found no complications so far. The surgical method presented is convenient and safe."

Adequate hydration with alkalinization prevented nephrotoxicity and no cumulative myelosuppression was observed. Serum MTX levels in nontoxic patients averaged 1 X 10(-6) M 24 hours following a 30-minute iv infusion of MTX at 3 g/m2. Among nontoxic women there was a 50-fold difference in the MTX level which correlated with the mean serum creatinine level. Response was assessed after 6--12 weeks of treatment by laparoscopy in patients with nonpalpable intra-abdominal tumor implants or by physical examination in patients with palpable masses. Despite the high levels of MTX achieved with the weekly schedule, only one partial response occurred among eight patients with visible or palpable metastatic lesions. Progressive disease was observed after 6--12 weeks of treatment in four of eleven women who began to receive MTX without evidence of disease or with lesions of less than 1.5 cm in diameter. MTX at the dose and schedule used in the present study appears to be of no benefit in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer."

Peritoneoscopy has made a large impact on the staging and follow-up of patients with ovarian cancer. Lymphangiography, combined more recently with ultrasonography or computerized tomography, appears to be especially useful in evaluating patients with cervical cancer for lymph node metastases outside the usual radiation treatment fields. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography are useful for evaluating masses for resectability and treatment response, planning radiation therapy, detecting metastases and ascites, and directing thin-needle aspiration of masses. Thin-needle aspiration techniques are now available which provide a means for sampling areas which were previously inaccessible except to open operative biopsy or where biopsy might result in serious complications."

Thirty-four of the 38 benign tumors were considered benign by sonographic criteria. Three of 4 borderline epithelial tumors were considered malignant sonographically, as were 22 of the 26 cancers of the ovary (sensitivity 84%). Nineteen of them were malignant epithelial neoplasms and most were classified as FIGO stages III and IV (76%). In 6 of the 7 patients with stage I and II cancers the latter were considered malignant by sonographic criteria. Twenty-three of the 26 cancers were classified as having a complex structure using the classic ultrasonographic criteria. Histopathological evaluation did not correlate with the ultrasonic findings: sonography could not predict the correct stage and a particular histological type.

Diagnosis is based on histology and immunohistochemistry, while the role of imaging studies is not diagnosis-specific. We present the case of a 38-year-old patient complaining of an increase in her abdominal circumference. Consequently, a vaginal examination, a transvaginal ultrasound and an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis were carried out. It should be noted that a preoperative diagnosis of GISTs is uncommon, due to the rarity and many presentations of the disease. Ultrasound and MRI are not able to differentiate a GIST from ovarian cancer. However, if a pelvic mass is detected, the possibility of a non-gynaecological tumor has to be considered."

CD009786,0,141518,0,Diagnostic laparoscopy from the pathologist's viewpoint.,"In conclusion, laparoscopy provides an easy approach to the diagnosis of various intraabdominal diseases. Because biopsy specimens are often small, adequate sampling is essential for accurate diagnosis. It is important for the laparoscopist to understand the basic pathologic anatomy of the diseases under consideration in order to provide the pathologist with adequate diagnostic material. The use of special techniques, including electron microscopy, may be helpful in establishing specific diagnosis in selected difficult cases."
CD009786,0,1825866,0,Laparoscopic excision of ovarian neoplasms subsequently found to be malignant.,"One hundred fifty-six members and candidate members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists responded to a survey concerning the ""laparoscopic management of ovarian neoplasms subsequently found to be malignant."" Twenty-nine responders (19%) reported a total of 42 cases of ovarian malignancy. The laparoscopic procedure was aborted or the cyst was aspirated in 38% of the cases, and partial or complete excisions were attempted in 33 and 29%, respectively. The characteristics of the masses were as follows: less than 8 cm 67%, cystic 62%, unilocular 48%, and unilateral 81%. All four ""benign"" characteristics were present in 31% of the cases found to be malignant, and three of four characteristics were present in 24%. Laparotomy was performed at the time of laparoscopy in 17% of cases, after laparoscopy in 71% with an average interval of 4.8 weeks, and not at all in 12%. Fifty-seven percent of the cases were invasive epithelial malignancies, whereas 29% were tumors of low malignant potential. At least 50% of the patients had stages II-IV. We conclude that attempted laparoscopic excisions of adnexal masses that are subsequently found to be malignant are not uncommon, and that the presence of so-called ""benign"" characteristics does not preclude malignancy. Attempts at partial or complete excision are common, as are delays in subsequent definitive surgery. The stage of disease is often advanced, and all histologic types of malignancy are encountered. We advocate careful evaluation of this practice, with development of strict guidelines to ensure optimal patient care."

CD009786,0,141514,0,The use of laparoscopy to determine the results of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.,"The chemotherapeutic management of patients with epithelial tumors of the ovary is hampered by a lack of diagnostic tests that are sufficiently sensitive for detecting residual or recurrent tumor. At the completion of a chemotherapy program, direct visualization of the peritoneal cavity is necessary to accurately assess the amount and location of residual tumor. Laparoscopy, with visually directed biopsies of residual tumor masses, can spare some patients a laparotomy and yet provide a safe and easy route for assessment of intraabdominal disease. If residual tumor is not seen at laparoscopy, than laparotomy with multiple peritoneal biopsies must be done so that residual tumor will not be missed and chemotherapy prematurely stopped. Laparoscopy is not an alternative to ""second look"" laparotomy but is a useful adjunct for determining the presence of resectable, unresectable or diffuse disease after chemotherapy."
CD009786,0,9194283,0,Prophylactic laparoscopic ovarian ablation for premenopausal breast cancer: medical and economic efficacy.,"Worldwide analysis showed a highly significant reduction in the annual rates both of recurrence and of death produced by ovarian ablation. We examined the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic laparoscopic oophorectomy for premenopausal breast cancer. Prophylactic laparoscopic oophorectomy was attempted in 15 selected premenopausal patients with breast cancer. After mastectomy, these patients had laparoscopic ovarian ablation as treatment for breast carcinoma with positive estrogen receptors. To evaluate the economic impact of laparoscopic oophorectomy, comparisons were made between patients treated laparoscopically and those treated with conventional surgery, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. The average time required for laparoscopic bilateral oophorectomy was 44 min. Oral intake was resumed the next morning, and the patients were discharged 3 days after surgery. No limitation on physical activity and no complications were required during postoperative days. There was no reduction in the overall costs of laparoscopic surgery and conventional surgery in Japan. The cost of one year's supply of tamoxifen was equivalent to the overall cost of surgical oophorectomy. From medical and economic viewpoints, we conclude that laparoscopic ovarian ablation should be considered an alternative to adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal women."

Eighteen months after the operation, she presented with recurrent occult bowel hemorrhage without evidence of an abdominal mass. Nine months later, a rapidly growing abdominal mass was detected. Laparoscopy revealed a solitary tumor of the ileum covered with an intact serosal layer. Partial ileectomy was performed for tumor resection. Histological examination revealed cells resembling the primary ovarian tumor in the mucosal surface of the small bowel along with an intact serosa. The tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for cytokeratin 20, suggesting an ovarian origin. This is the first report of solitary metastasis of an ovarian carcinoma to the small bowel parenchyma without peritoneal dissemination.

The predictive value of the number of chemotherapy cycles to achieve a serum CA125 of < 35 U/ml is compared to the predictive value of s, the rate of achieving a normal serum CA125. s is generated from an exponential regression model. This study suggests that s accurately predicts which patients have residual disease at reassessment laparotomy, who will be free of disease, and, of those in the latter group, who are at greatest risk to recur, as well as overall survival. If these observations are confirmed, physicians may base further therapeutic intervention on the basis of a calculated parameter following complete clinical response to first-line treatment rather than relying on findings at reassessment laparotomy."

CD009786,0,23159202,0,[Follow-up and counselling after pelvic inflammatory disease].,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can be responsible for infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Treatment of acute PID is very important as it can reduce the risk of sequelae. However, follow-up, partner treatment and counselling are also useful to reduce the reinfection rate. Few weeks after PID, clinical evaluation as well as transvaginal and transabdominal sonography must be performed. The interest of systematic bacteriological tests is not proved. Hysterosalpingography and second-look laparoscopy should be considered only for women with infertility and severe infection. Use of condom is advisable in this population in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STD) including HIV and to decrease rate of recurrence, associated to contraceptive pill, which is also a good option. In selected cases, intrauterine devices can be used in patients with history of PID if the infection is resolved and no significant risk factors for STD exist. Infertility and chronic pelvic pain are the most common sequelae in the population of young women with severe and recurrent infection. The risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher for these women and must be kept in mind. Counselling and risk-reduction interventions decreased significatively the rate of recurrence and sequelae in PID."

About 95% of hyperandrogenic women will have PCOS. Endometrial hyperplasia can be prevented in hyperandrogenic, anovulatory women by the oral contraceptive pill or progestins. Hirsutism is best treated by a combination of the oral contraceptive pill and an anti-androgen. The first line of therapy for ovulation induction is clomiphene citrate, with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) or laparoscopic ovulation induction reserved for clomiphene failures. hMG together with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist may decrease the risk of spontaneous abortion following ovulation induction in PCOS.

CD009786,0,8038406,0,The role of laparoscopic surgery in gynecologic oncology.,"As a result of recent technological advances, laparoscopic lymphadenectomy is becoming the standard method for the staging of pelvic cancer. More extensive procedures, such as para-aortic lymph node dissection and radical hysterectomy, have also been demonstrated to be feasible by advanced laparoscopic surgery. This new approach appears to be very promising. In the future, because of its well documented advantages, laparoscopic surgery may appear as a way to decrease the morbidity of cancer treatment in patients with low-risk tumors and to propose more aggressive treatments of patients with tumors associated with a poor prognosis. These new techniques should be reserved for surgical teams trained in oncologic and major laparoscopic surgery. More clinical research is required before this approach can be proposed as an alternative to laparotomy, and guidelines have to be established.

The general surgeon may confront in his practice solid ovarian mass, sometimes in emergency. Between 1995 and 2005, we report thirteen cases of ovarian fibroma (two bilateral) and two ovarian thecoma with mean age 53 years operated in First Surgical Clinic Iasi. Four of them were operated on as emergencies. Clinical ascites are found in three patients with large tumors. The early symptoms were pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding. Patients with large tumors or ascites were admitted with compression symptoms or abdominal distension. Ultrasonography showed a solid uniformly hypo-echogenic mass, with very marked sound attenuation. We performed oophorectomy in six cases (laparoscopic approach in four cases) and salpingo-oophorectomy in nine cases (using laparoscopic stapler in three cases). There were no conversions to laparotomy. In all cases the diagnosis was established by histological examination.

CD009786,0,22764562,0,Ovarian cysts in adolescents: medical and surgical management.,"Contemporary management of ovarian cysts in the adolescent consists of conservative management, whether expectant, medical, or surgical. An understanding of ovarian physiology in the perimenarcheal and postpubertal patient supports ovarian preservation surgery, as the rate of malignancy is low and the alternative can be devastating. The most common ovarian cysts in adolescents are functional and often regress without further treatment. Symptomatic ovarian cysts warrant further investigation. Endometriomas arising from endometriosis are extremely uncommon. Tubo-ovarian abscesses are managed medically and rarely by drainage or surgery. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and prompt conservative operative management is indicated. Consideration of additional imaging, tumor markers, and surgical management of persistent or complex masses with ultrasound findings suspicious for malignancy is appropriate. This article reviews all these conditions and conservative management using laparoscopy as the preferred method if surgical intervention is needed. Unilateral removal of malignancies is advocated when possible."

CD009786,0,8455217,0,The role of sonographically guided aspiration in the clinical management of ovarian cysts.,"This study was undertaken to verify the role of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) followed by cytologic examination as a possible alternative to surgery in case of cystic pelvic masses. From January 1988 to March 1989, 204 patients with a proven cystic pelvic mass underwent FNA under sonographic guidance. In 20 cases the aspiration was performed transvaginally. Thirty-six patients were postmenopausal. In all cases the aspirated fluid was collected for cytologic evaluation. Other than one case of persistent hematuria, no complications occurred. The overall recurrence rate, verified 3 months from FNA, was 65%. Fifty-two per cent of patients developed a new cyst after a complete aspiration. Fifty-three patients underwent a laparotomy, allowing a comparison between cytologic and histologic patterns. The sensitivity of cytologic examination of aspirated fluids was 40% (3 of 5 malignancies were missed) and the specificity was 100% (no false positives were observed). We conclude that FNA might be proposed in young women with a unilocular ovarian cyst to avoid a surgical procedure. In postmenopausal women with a unilocular cystic mass 5 cm or less, FNA may be considered as an important step in the diagnosis. In all instances the ultrasonographic appearance of the cyst (echo texture and regularity of wall) and the characteristics of aspirated fluid are the most important findings. When the aspirated fluid contains mucus or blood, or when a complex mass is present, exploratory laparotomy or a laparoscopy is recommended."

CD009786,0,8835491,0,[Surgical therapy of ovarian carcinoma].,"Aim of primary surgery in early stage ovarian cancer (FIGO I-IIA) is a complete removal of all visible tumors and an exact staging of intraabdominal and retroperitoneal tumor spread. Debulking of tumor as radical as possible is the aim of surgery in advanced stages of disease (FIGO IIb-IV). After 2 to 3 cycles of an active polychemotherapy interventional debulking surgery is performed with the intention to remove all existing tumors in those patients with postoperative residual tumor masses > 1 cm in diameter after first surgery. Second-look surgery is performed after 6 cycles of first line polychemotherapy either to confirm a clinical complete remission pathohistologically or to debulk persisting residual tumors. Secondary tumordebulking and its influence on survival as well as the diagnostic value of second-look surgery is discussed controversially, so today second-look is confined to clinical protocols. Cytoreduction of relapsing tumor masses seems to prolong survival in those patients with a relapse free interval of more than 12 months. This seems to be an attractive therapeutic alternative. For the future one can expect more selective operation strategies on the basis of new biologic prognosticators and new developments in minimal invasive operation techniques."

Very rare secretory Brenner tumours (BT) have been described, generally after the menopause. A 31-year-old woman sought medical advice for secondary amenorrhoea, progressive hirsutism and a 5-year history of virilisation syndrome with clitoromegaly. Testosterone was markedly high (285 ng/dl, N<85) with moderate elevation of delta 4-androstenedione (D4AD) (311 ng/dl, N <270), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (366 μg/dl, N <340) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) (275 ng/dl). LH was 9 IU/l, FSH 4.3 IU/l, estradiol 60 pg/ml and progesterone 314 ng/100 ml. Cortisol was decreased (1.3 μg/dl) after the dexamethasone suppression test. Pelvic MRI showed a 5-cm right ovarian tumour with a 2.5 cm nodular component and cystic areas, and two nodules measuring 11 mm and 15 mm above the right and left ovaries. After right ovariectomy by laparoscopy, pathological examination concluded on a 3-cm SLCT and a 2-cm BT; the nodules above the ovaries were dysembryoplastic cysts. Postoperatively, testosterone level was normal after 24 h (26 ng/dl), estradiol and progesterone rapidly decreased, cyclic secretion then resumed and the patient menstruated at day 27. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an ovarian tumour associating a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour and a Brenner tumour in a patient with virilisation syndrome which resolved after ovariectomy."

Complications such as wound breakdown, respiratory challenges, cardiac complications and difficult intubations are associated with obesity. For the patient with uterine cancer, surgery is necessary for staging, control of symptoms and cure. With the advent of the da Vinci(™) intuitive robot, alternative surgical options can now be offered to these patients. While surgery is the principal modality for the treatment and management of uterine cancer, the morbidly obese patient faces increased complications and longer postoperative recovery. As studied in the LAP2, comparable outcomes have been noted in laparotomy vs laparoscopic surgery. Recently, minimally invasive surgery has been refined with the advent of the da Vinci robotic system. Applying a minimally invasive technique further enhanced with the da Vinci robotic system, a total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed on a patient with a BMI of 98."
CD009786,0,12057051,0,Advanced ovarian cancer.,"State-of-the-art treatment for advanced ovarian cancer requires a multimodality approach. Aggressive surgical debulking with the goal of optimal cytoreduction is the initial step. After primary cytoreductive surgery, standard treatment for patients with stage III and IV disease is systemic combination chemotherapy consisting of six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Approximately 70% of patients enter a clinical remission with this approach, yet less than 30% remain disease free. Options following primary therapy include observation or second surgical assessment if no clinical evidence of disease is present. Novel strategies for consolidation are needed. Second-look surgery can be performed safely and effectively laparoscopically, and this is the most accurate means of identifying patients who appear to be clinically free of disease but actually harbor persistent cancer. Although this procedure is an extremely accurate means of identifying these patients, women who have pathologically negative second-look surgery are still at risk for relapse. Patients can receive additional treatment following second-look surgical assessment via the intraperitoneal route if they are pathologically negative or if they have microscopic or small volume disease. Alternatively, additional systemic chemotherapy can be given with non-cross-resistant systemic agents, but no current standard approach for consolidation therapy exists for patients following the completion of primary treatment. Unfortunately, most patients relapse. Multiple agents with similar activity in phase II trials are available to treat patients with advanced recurrent disease. Combination therapy in this setting has not been shown to have significantly superior progression-free or overall survival compared with single agents. The selection of treatment for patients with recurrent disease is currently based on a determination of the treatment-free interval since last treatment, as well as the route, schedule, and expected side effects of the agent."
CD009786,0,12775541,0,Laparoscopic adnexectomy of a persistent ovarian tumor in a girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse.,"The management of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) relapse and an ovarian tumor remains controversial. The authors report about a 4-year-old girl who developed a late bone marrow and cutaneous relapse of her pre-B-cell ALL and revealed an enlargement of her left ovary (4 x 3 x 2 cm). Chemotherapy (ALL-REZ-BFM pilot-protocol 2002) achieved effective remission, but the ovarian mass depicted no regression. Laparoscopic adnexectomy was performed and the tumor could be extracted in a specimen-bag through a 12-mm umbilical incision. Histology detected no viable lymphoblasts, but a fibrotic enlargement due to previous cellular infiltration. The authors conclude that in children with ALL relapse and an ovarian tumor, malignant infiltration as well as local response to chemotherapy can be judged only by surgical excision and histopathologic examination. Laparoscopic oophoradnexectomy is a valuable management option in these children."
CD009786,0,20059391,0,Laparoscopic excision of infarcted accessory spleen.,"An accessory spleen is present in about 10-30% of the population and, usually, does not cause symptoms. We present a case report of an unusual presentation of accessory spleen infarction, with a literature review. A 12-year old male presented with acute left-upper quadrant pain that slowly resolved. An ultrasound and computed tomography scan showed a 3.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm solid mass abutting and displacing the splenic flexure of the colon, with surrounding inflammatory changes. This was interpreted as a colonic duplication cyst, and the boy was treated with antibiotics and underwent elective laparoscopic exploration. It was removed laparoscopically without complication and, on pathologic examination, proved to be consistent with an infarcted accessory spleen. Less than two dozen similar cases of accessory spleen infarction have been reported in the literature, most presenting with acute abdominal pain. Preoperative diagnoses included appendicitis, ovarian torsion, neoplasm, and, in our case, colonic duplication. The natural course of infarcted accessory spleen would be to atrophy, but, even with advanced imaging techniques, it may be impossible to diagnose infarcted accessory spleen with enough confidence to avoid surgery."

A positive interval laparoscopy was predictive of disease in 91% of patients, whereas a negative interval laparoscopy showed absence of disease at second look in only 70.5% of patients. A positive laparoscopic biopsy at six months showed presence of disease at second look procedure in 100% (11 of 11) of patients. It is concluded that either an intensive initial chemotherapy or change in therapy such as intraperitoneal chemotherapy after positive interval laparoscopy is indicated in future studies."

In 2000 women over 45 years old, without any evidence of adnexal disease, pelvic examination and serum CA-125 determination were performed. When either the findings of the pelvic examination were ambiguous or positive, or the serum CA-125 level was > 35 U/ml, further investigation including ultrasonography and laparoscopy or laparotomy was done. Among 174 women with clinical findings of adnexal disease there were 15 (8.62%) who had serum CA-125 > 35 U/ml. Among 18 women with elevated serum CA-125 (> 35 U/ml) there were 15 women (83.33%) who had clinical findings of adnexal disease. In 15 women further investigation was suggestive of adnexal disease and surgical exploration revealed three cases of malignancy. One case of serious ovarian cystadenocarcinoma stage Ia, one case of borderline ovarian tumour and one case of metastatic carcinoma from the right kidney. The other 12 women had benign adnexal masses or pelvic endometriosis. In our study this combined approach had sensitivity 100%, specificity 99.70% and P.P.V. 22%. According to these data, the procedure could be a potential component of a strategy aimed to the early detection of ovarian cancer, regardless of the financial cost."
CD009786,0,17401568,0,An ovarian tumour with a potential appendiceal origin.,"A 14-year-old girl underwent left oopherectomy for a multicystic ovarian mass. Histology revealed this to be an intestinal type mucinous borderline tumour (IMBT). In view of this, a semi-urgent laparoscopic appendicectomy was carried out. The appendix was histologically normal. IMBT of the ovary is a mucinous tumour with atypical proliferation of the goblet cell containing epithelium. It is known to occur simultaneously with tumours of the appendix. Paediatric surgeons need to be aware of this rare tumour and when operating on any ovarian pathology should always inspect the peritoneal cavity for mucinous deposits and examine the appendix."
CD009786,0,20181551,0,VEGF hypersecretion as a plausible mechanism for pseudo-meigs' syndrome in advanced colorectal cancer.,"We present a case of pseudo-meigs' syndrome caused by a metastatic ovarian tumor of rectal cancer origin, and examine the possible involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathogenesis of refractory fluid retention. A 42-year-old woman with advanced rectal cancer underwent a laparoscopic anterior resection of the rectum. During systemic chemotherapy treatment, she complained of severe abdominal distension 16 months following the operation. We failed to improve massive ascites by diuretics and repeated abdominocenteses. Without any definite evidence of carcinomatous peritonitis, we chose to extirpate an enlarged ovarian tumor on the presumptive diagnosis of pseudo-meigs' syndrome. Ascites disappeared promptly after resecting the ovarian tumors and the subject resumed systemic chemotherapy. Preoperative high levels of serum VEGF were normalized promptly after the operation. Levels of VEGF expression in metastatic ovarian tumors were as weak as in the primary tumor upon immunohistochemical staining. In contrast, increased VEGF expression was evident in epithelial cells of oviducts. For patients with massive and refractory ascites, we need to keep in mind the disease entity of pseudo-meigs' syndrome, since surgical intervention possibly improves conditions. Furthermore, the hypersecretion of VEGF from oviducts may play a role in the pathogenesis of clinical manifestations of pseudo-meigs' syndrome."
CD009786,0,8571460,0,The value of transvaginal color Doppler in the assessment of pelvic inflammatory disease.,"This study compares transvaginal color and pulsed Doppler (TVCD), laparoscopic and clinical findings in 102 women with proven pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Seventy-two (72) of them had acute symptoms, 11 presented with chronic pelvic pain and 19 patients were infertility cases suspected of tubal etiology. Uterine sonographic findings were demonstrated in 72 patients (70.6%). Free fluid in the cul-de-sac was demonstrated in 39 (38.2%) patients. Ovarian enlargement as the only finding was demonstrated in 6 (5.9%) patients, 22 (21.6%) presented with tubular adnexal structure, while in 74 (72.5%) patients it was of a complex nature. Color flow was obtained in all 6 patients presenting with ovarian enlargement, in 12 (54.5%) of those presenting with tubular adnexal structure, and in 56 (75.7%) of those with complex adnexal mass. Ovarian morphology was clearly delineated from adnexal mass in 59 patients (55.9%). The ipsilateral ovarian flow was altered in 50 of them (84.7%). The mean resistance index (RI) in patients with acute symptoms was 0.53 +/- 0.09 (+/-SD). It significantly differed from those obtained in patients with chronic pelvic pain (RI = 0.71 +/- 0.07) and infertility cases (RI = 0.73 +/- 0.09).

However, vaporization of endometriosis, particularly large plaques and hemorrhagic areas, is associated with significant amounts of carbon deposition in the desicated tissues. Further, it is difficult to ascertain complete removal of disease in some areas. In this study, 66 patients were treated by excision of peritoneal and/or ovarian endometriosis with the carbon dioxide laser via laparoscopy. Using excisional techniques, we were able to visualize the extent of peritoneal penetration and subperitoneal spread of endometriotic nodules.

Ninety-six patients completed 6 months of therapy at a dosage of 800 mg daily, and 107 patients completed therapy with 400 mg daily. No difference was reported in the incidence of side effects, regardless of dosage. Gross resolution of disease (as determined by second-look laparotomy or laparoscopy) was evaluated in 110 patients and found to be similar, regardless of dosage. Ovarian endometriosis greater than 1 cm was observed to respond significantly less well to danazol than peritoneal or ovarian disease less than 1 cm. Pregnancy rates for 157 patients with no other discernible causes of infertility were slightly higher for the 800-mg danazol regimen than for the 400-mg regimen. In patients with mild disease, the use of danazol alone resulted in pregnancy rates lower than those achieved with conservative surgery alone. Its use preoperatively for all stages of disease resulted in slightly higher pregnancy rates than when conservative surgery alone was employed. Danazol was less effective when used postoperatively. No differences were observed between three classification schemes in their ability to predict subsequent prognosis for conception."

The aim of the study is to evaluate indications and feasibility of laparoscopy and video-assisted prophylactic gonadectomy in children with Ullrich Turner syndrome (UTS) or 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis (GoDy). Between 1996 and December 2002 five girls with UTS and nine patients with 46,XY GoDy (female gender role) were explored by laparoscopy. Video-assisted salpingo-oophorectomy or gonadectomy was performed using a three-port technique. Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy was exclusively performed in UTS patients with proven presence of translocated parts of the Y chromosome. In three patients with 46,XY GoDy laparoscopy was followed by surgical revision of the groin and open gonadectomy in four patients. In two cases with UTS the removed streak gonads contained small unilateral tumours stage pT1a, and in four cases of 46, XY GoDy histopathological investigation revealed bilateral neoplasms stage pT1b. We found the following tumour types: gonadoblastoma, dysgerminoma, testicular intraepithelial neoplasia, and mature teratoma. In conclusion, investigative laparoscopy gives a good image of the internal genital structures and allows the safe removal of the dysgenetic gonads during the same operation.

The procedure can be done by open surgery (laparotomy) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) technique. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery include shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activity, and reduced postoperative pain. However, conventional laparoscopic surgery techniques required the infusion of gas carbon dioxide in the peritoneum to distend the abdomen and displace the bowel upward to create the room for surgical manipulation. Serious complications such as abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the circulating blood (hypercarbia) and perforation of internal organs have also been reported. These serious complication may be harmful to the fetus."

CD009786,0,8906667,0,Outpatient minilaparotomy ovarian cystectomy for benign teratomas in teenagers.,"Benign cystic teratomas are the most common ovarian neoplasms in adolescents. An ovary-conserving method was developed for outpatient surgical removal of benign cystic teratomas by minilaparotomy in teenagers. The technique requires no specialized training, laser devices, or expensive disposable instrumentation. As a precaution, the first teenager in whom the technique was used was observed as an inpatient for 3 days. Following this, the method was used as an outpatient procedure in three further cases. No complications occurred in any of the four patients, and the mean operating time of 85 minutes (range, 60 to 95 minutes) was similar to the reported time for removal of benign cystic teratomas by laparotomy. Although a randomized controlled study with many more patients would be necessary for a definitive conclusion, considerable cost savings and reduction in morbidity over traditional laparotomy are suggested by this experience."

The response was evaluated through repeated laparoscopy with multiple biopsies and serial measurement of Ovarian Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125); 11/36 patients had a complete (6 patients) or partial (5 patients) response. Toxicity (both local and general) was observed starting from 25 mg/m2 of M per cycle. The amount of drug reaching systemic circulation was monitored by measuring M plasma value after i.p. treatment. This study showed wide variations in serum levels obtained after i.p. doses ranging from 23 to 36 mg/m2. The area under the curve (AUC) of mitoxantrone plasma samples, did not correlate with the i.p. administered dose. Conversely, a correlation seems to exist between the plasma AUC and the responder status.

In 36 cases, cysts were bilateral. 678 cysts (84%) were treated by pelviscopy alone. Organ-preserving treatment was performed in 83%, oophorectomy or adnexectomy in only 17% of cases. Two stage Ia ovarian carcinomas (0.26% of all cysts) were operated on by pelviscopy before laparotomy. Sonography is particularly important in determining whether a pelviscopic approach is appropriate. Pelviscopic procedures are unacceptable in multilocular cysts measuring greater than or equal to 7 cm in diameter with echo-dense components. Special caution is required for any cyst measuring greater than 9 cm in diameter. The risk of opening a malignant cyst must be weighed against the advantages of pelviscopic surgery: minimal physical strain, better postoperative quality of life, and organ conservation. In doubtful cases, laparotomy is recommended."
CD009786,0,18336393,0,Timing of debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer.,"It is clear that primary debulking remains the standard of care within the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage III and IV). This debulking surgery should be performed by a gynecological oncologist without any residual tumor load, or so-called ""optimal debulking."" Over the last decades, interest in the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy together with an interval debulking has increased. Neoadjuvant therapy can be used for patients who are primarily suboptimally debulked due to an extensive tumor load. In this situation, based on the randomized European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Gynaecological Cancer Group trial, interval debulking by an experienced surgeon improves survival in some patients who did not undergo optimal primary debulking surgery. Based on the GOG 152 data, interval debulking surgery does not seem to be indicated in patients who underwent primarily a maximal surgical effort by a gynecological oncologist. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can also be used as an alternative to primary debulking. In retrospective analyses, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery does not seem to worsen prognosis compared to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, we will have to wait for the results of future randomized trials to know whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is a good alternative to primary debulking surgery in stage IIIc and IV patients. Open laparoscopy is probably the most valuable tool for evaluating the operability primarily or at the time of interval debulking surgery."

In the last two decades, treatment of these tumors in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at our hospital has depended on the stage of the disease and the age of the patient. It ranged from laparoscopic cyst extirpation to hysterectomy with bilateral adnectomy and omental resection and regional lymphnodectomy. From the end of 1985 to the end of 1992, 35 patients with borderline tumors of the ovaries were operated on. Histologically, 14 borderline tumors were mucinous, 21 were serous. A follow-up investigation was carried out five to 11 years after primary operation. In this period, no patient died of borderline tumor. Twenty-eight patients who were followed up were clinically free of recurrence, five patients are alive, but could not be followed up. Two patients have died of other diseases after five years. Only one patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. She could not be followed up. In the meantime, peritoneal implants were demonstrated at second-look laparoscopies in four out of 18 patients. Later, these could no longer be demonstrated (one patient) or did not affect the survival time (three patients) and thus ultimately was not pathologically relevant. Primarily, two of these four patient had stage Ia-Ic. The paraffin blocks of the preparations are still available from 26 patients, and additional investigations could be carried out. Nineteen percent of the borderline tumors showed micropapillary structures of an MPCS (= micropapillary serous carcinoma), which evidently did not have a negative effect on the prognosis. All borderline tumors showed diploid distributions in DNA cytometry. It is not possible to make a definitive treatment recommendation on the basis of this investigation because the number of patients followed up was too small."

A laparoscopic method for treatment of non-neoplastic ovarian cysts.,"A laparoscopic method of managing macroscopically benign, unilateral, unilocular, mobile, translucent, and smooth-walled ovarian cysts in women of reproductive age is described. The method requires the cutting of a window in the cyst wall through the laparoscope fenestration. In preference to aspiration at laparoscopy or removal at laparotomy, this method has the advantage of ensuring histologic material as well as permanent drainage by the use of atraumatic surgical technique. Nineteen cysts were fenestrated laparoscopically. Four cysts could not be classified, two owing to lack of histologic material, two owing to malpreparation of the selected cyst tissue. In one case an epithelial cyst--a mucinous cystadenoma, being laparoscopically unsuspected--was fenestrated. One cyst recurred.

The amount of residual tumor following primary surgery was an important prognosis factor. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a new therapeutic approach. Secondary, optimal surgery could be done in better conditions. The purpose was to access the ability of preoperative abdominopelvic CT to predict success of debulking surgery for ovarian carcinoma: less than 1 cm of residual tumor size after initial surgery. We reviewed 39 patients (2 stages Ic, 1 stage IIc, 22 stages III and 14 stages IV) operated on for ovarian carcinoma between January 1992 and December 1997. Surgical criteria of inability to perform optimal surgical cytoreduction were compared with abdominopelvic CT done the month before. CT scans were prospectively assessed by radiologist A and retrospectively (3 months to 6 years delay) rewiewed separately by radiologists A and B without surgical data. Nineteen patients underwent optimal debulking surgery: 13 no residual tumor and 6 with residual lesions under 1 cm. The interreader (0.73) and intrareader (0.9) agreement, worked out by Kappa coefficient, was juged good to very good. The sensitivity of CT was 91% with a specificity of 95%.

CD009786,0,17006424,0,[Laparoscopic treatment of adnexal cystic masses].,"Operative laparoscopy has become the gold standard for the surgical treatment of numerous gynecological benign conditions. In the case of ovarian cysts, however, the use of the laparoscopic approach has been debated due to the possibility of encountering an unexpected ovarian malignancy at the time of surgery. This would upstage a IA or IB ovarian malignancy to IC. In this review, the authors evaluate the preoperative parameters that could help in the selection of the patients who are candidate to a laparoscopic approach. In particular, the authors consider the age related risk of the patients, the use of sonography and color-Doppler velocimetry, the use of CA 125, and as a last diagnostic step, the findings at laparoscopy. In a personal series of 1.584 cysts in patients under 40 years of age, the first author encountered 7 unexpected borderline tumors and 1 mucinous G1 adenocarcinoma, while no malignancy was found in a group of strictly selected postmenopausal patients. These data have been compared with those found in scientific literature. There is no sound evidence that the stripping procedure determines a reduction of the ovarian reserve when performed with strict microsurgical principles. Recent evidence in the literature suggests that the decreased ovarian responsiveness reported by some authors following ovarian cystectomy may not be a consequence of surgery. The concern of a possible reduction of the ovarian reserve needs to be balanced with the benefits obtained with surgery. Finally, it should always be kept in mind the risk of an unexpected malignancy, even in cysts apparently benign, malignancy that can only be diagnosed through surgery obtaining a specimen for pathology."

Total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and appendectomy should also be performed in patients with epithelial ovarian tumors. Evidence suggests that patients who have had optimal cytoreduction of the tumor (less than 1.5 cm) have a better outcome following chemotherapy. Patients who have no clinical or CT evidence of disease after a full course of chemotherapy should be explored to confirm disease status.

All the patients had a preoperative study and once completed they were selected for laparoscopic surgery. The laparoscopic procedure was able to solve the gynecologic pathology. The mean overall surgical time was of 66.8 min with a maximum time of 180 and a minimum of 30 min, accordingly to the groups the surgical mean times were as follows: 1) adhesiolysis 111 min 2) ovarian surgery 69 min 3) hysterectomy 113 min 4) tubal surgery 60 min and 5) myomectomy 58 min. There were no surgical complications and they all had a brief hospitalization period and a fast return to active life. All procedures were done with a bipolar cautery.

CD009786,0,1955662,0,[Ovarian tumors and cysts after 50 years of age. Retrospective study from 1979 to 1989 at the Foch hospital].,This is a retrospective study carried out between the years 1979 and 1989 to look at the anatomopathology of tumours and ovarian cysts occurring in women over 50 years of age who had operations in our department. We found a raised incidence of malignant tumours (30%) when a late diagnosis is made (70% diagnosed at stages 3 and 4). There was a higher incidence of fibrothecomas (10%) along with the nine tumours. This is an important finding because functional cysts have only been found in non-menopausal women or in women who have recently had their menopause who have been taking hormone replacement therapy. Ovarian cysts in menopausal women are therefore primarily organic. This result makes it possible to outline a therapeutic regime specifically designed for the menopausal women. In effect the proposed treatment would either be laparoscopic surgery or laparotomy because it is very doubtful whether ultrasound puncture should be carried out because one cannot be sure that it is not a malignant cyst. The authors take the occasion of this study to view the complimentary tests that can be carried out for ovarian cysts. These are mainly ultrasounds and estimations of CA125. The therapeutic methods that are available are then transparietal cystectomy or intraperitoneal cystectomy or intraperitoneal cystectomy which means laparotomy with removal of the cyst.

However, present detection techniques are not very effective, and symptoms are more commonly seen in later stage disease. Amino acids, structural proteins, and enzymatic cofactors have endogenous optical properties influenced by precancerous changes and tumor growth. We present the technical details of an optical spectroscopy system used to quantify these properties. A fiber optic probe excites the surface epithelium (origin of 90% of cases) over 270 to 580 nm and collects fluorescence and reflectance at 300 to 800 nm with four or greater orders of magnitude instrument to background suppression. Up to four sites per ovary are investigated on patients giving consent to oophorectomy and the system's in vivo optical evaluation. Data acquisition is completed within 20 s per site. We illustrate design, selection, and development of the components used in the system. Concerns relating to clinical use, performance, calibration, and quality control are addressed. In the future, spectroscopic data will be compared with histological biopsies from the corresponding tissue sites. If proven effective, this technique can be useful in screening women at high risk of developing ovarian cancer to determine whether oophorectomy is necessary."

Although ovarian cancer is a significant cause of mortality in menopausal women, large population-based studies demonstrate that the majority of adnexal masses are benign. Despite this, the appearance of an adnexal mass is a concern for the patient and an insight exercise for physicians. In most cases, an adnexal enlargement is an incidental finding, generally corresponding to a benign cyst and easily diagnosed by conventional ultrasound. Exceptionally an ovarian tumour may be malignant and should be treated as early as possible. When conventional ultrasound renders complex morphology other diagnostic tools must be used such as: colour Doppler and functional tumour vessel properties, serum CA 125 levels, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and in some cases laparoscopy. Several new tumour markers are being studied for clinical application, although there are presently no clear recommendations. Adnexal masses with benign morphological and functional properties must be periodically monitored as an alternative to surgery since malignant transformation is exceptional."

Her left ovary had been removed at the age of 38 years old for a benign cyst and vaginal hysterectomy was performed one year later for cervical carcinoma. She had taken premarin 0.625 mg daily since her surgeries. Initial hormonal studies revealed elevated serum concentrations of total testosterone 524 ng/dL (N: 6-86 ng/dL), free testosterone 20.9 pg/mL (N: 0.3-2.7 pg/mL), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone 270 ng/dL (N: < 70 ng/dL); but normal baseline concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, androstenedione, and cortisol. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the adrenals and ultrasonography of the pelvis were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis similarly were non-revealing. She was given glucocorticoids without effect. Subsequently, retrograde selective venous sampling showed a marked testosterone gradient in the right ovarian vein. A laparoscopic right oophorectomy was performed and a 11 mm Leydig cell tumour of hilus cell type was detected on histologic examination. Postoperative testosterone levels returned to normal and she had slow regression of hirsutism. Our case illustrates that a virilizing ovarian neoplasm can be small and elude imaging studies. We suggest bilateral oophorectomy for postmenopausal women with severe recent-onset virilization and without Cushing's syndrome and with normal adrenal imaging. This approach avoids unnecessary investigations and delays in definitive management."
CD009786,0,15742862,0,Conservative laparoscopic management of ovarian teratoma torsion in a young woman.,"Benign cystic tumors, specifically dermoid or mucinous cysts, are the most frequent causes of ovarian torsion. In clinical practice, adnexal torsion is usually subjected to adnexectomy to prevent embolism of thrombosed ovarian veins and its sequelae. However, this intervention is unsatisfactory for young women who want to preserve their fertility. In such situations, conservative management with untwisting of the adnexa, followed by cystectomy to preserve part of the ovary, would be a better option. In this report, we present a case of adnexal torsion due to cystic teratoma. A 25-year-old unmarried woman with lower abdominal pain and nausea was referred to our emergency room with suspicion of an ovarian mass. Ultrasonography showed a left ovarian mass measuring 9.7 x 6.5 x 6.2 cm with heterogeneous components within it. Laparoscopy showed an enlarged, dusky left ovary with torsion. Detorsion was performed and followed by cystectomy. The pathology revealed cystic teratoma of the ovary. We report this case to emphasize that untwisting of potentially viable adnexa, followed by cystectomy, in patients with adnexal torsion appears to be a safe procedure. This conservative approach should be encouraged in women of childbearing age to reduce the possibility of premenopausal loss of ovarian function."

Ninety-four (48.9%) patients developed recurrent disease after a median time of 18 months (range, 4-89 months) from surgical reassessment. The recurrence involved the pelvis in 45 (47.9%) cases, the abdomen in 42 (44.7%), the retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 13 (13.8%), and distant sites in 20 (21.2%). On the whole series, 5- and 7-year disease-free survival rates after negative second-look were 47.4 and 44.5%, respectively.

These transducers made it possible to visualize the gallbladder and bile ducts and evaluate for the presence of stones, to detect masses and provide guidance for their aspiration or biopsy, and to image the internal structures of the ovary and fallopian tube. In addition, these miniature transducers were used to locate such normal vital structures as blood vessels, thereby allowing the surgeon to decide on the best approach for dissection during mediastinoscopy. During conventional surgery, the surgeon or gynecologist can palpate an area of abnormality not directly visualized. However, during laparoscopy and mediastinoscopy direct palpation is not possible.

This method appears to be safe and is associated with a significantly high survival rate."

CD009786,0,21944035,0,Primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer.,"Advanced ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis. De-bulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy are the cornerstones of the treatment. Primary debulking surgery has been the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer. Recently a new strategy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery has been developed. In a recently published randomised trial of the EORTC-NCIC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - National Cancer Institute Canada) in patients with extensive stage IIIc and IV ovarian cancer it was shown that the survival was similar for patients randomised to neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking compared to primary debulking surgery, followed by chemotherapy. The post-operative complications and mortality rates were lower after interval debulking than after primary debulking surgery. The most important independent prognostic factor for overall survival was no residual tumour after primary or interval debulking surgery. In some patients obtaining the goal of no residual tumour at interval debulking is difficult due to chemotherapy-induced fibrosis. On the other hand the patients randomised had very extensive stage IIIc and IV disease and in patients with metastases smaller than 5 cm the survival tended to be better after primary debulking surgery. Hence, selection of the correct patients with stage IIIc or IV ovarian cancer for primary debulking or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is important. Besides imaging with CT, diffusion MRI and/or PET-CT, also laparoscopy can play an important role in the selection of patients. It should be emphasised that the group of patients included in this study had extensive stage IIIc or IV disease. Surgical skills, especially in the upper abdomen, remain pivotal in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. However, very aggressive surgery should be tailored according to the general condition and extent of the disease of the patients. Otherwise, this type of aggressive surgery will result in unnecessary postoperative morbidity and mortality without improving survival. Hence, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should not be an easy way out, but is in some patients with stage IIIc or IV ovarian cancer a better alternative treatment option than primary debulking. According to the current treatment algorithm at the University Hospitals Leuven about 50% of the patients with stage IIIc or IV ovarian cancer are selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
CD009786,0,10422684,0,Advanced ovarian cancer patients with no evidence of disease after platinum-based chemotherapy: retrospective analysis of the role of second-look.,"From 1981 to 1992, 230 previously chemotherapy-untreated epithelial ovarian cancer patients (Stages IIb-III or IV) received platinum-based polychemotherapy at our Division. In this presentation, time to progression and overall survival rates were retrospectively analyzed in 89 epithelial ovarian cancer patients (stage IIb, c - III or IV) with no clinical evidence of disease (clinical complete remission--CCR--in 26 patients with postsurgical residual tumor > or = 2 cm, and no clinical evidence of disease--NED--in 63 patients with post-surgical residual tumor < 2 cm) after first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy. After at least 6 courses of chemotherapy, 62 patients (group A) were submitted to second-look (SL) laparotomy (n=47) or laparoscopy (n=15); 27 patients (group B) did not undergo second-look surgery because of patient refusal, the surgeon's decision or clinical contro-indications to surgery. Groups A and B were comparable in terms of post-surgical residual tumor (< 2 cm: 71% vs 70%), median Performance Status (WHO: 1) and median age (56 vs 57 yrs). FIGO stage IIb, c was more frequent in group B (26% vs 18%--p=0.004). In 9/18 (50%) patients with clinical CR and in 31/44 (70%) NED patients no residual tumor was confirmed at SL (pathological CR--pCR). After a median follow-up of 10 years (range 5-16 years), 72% (64/89) of patients relapsed and 65% (58/89) died. Survival was significantly longer in patients with pCR (median survival 76 months vs 32, 29 and 16 months for patients with pPR, pNC or pPD, respectively, p=0.0001). Multivariate analysis identifies pCR as the only significant prognostic factor exerting an influence on survival after second-look laparotomy (p=0.0000). This study confirms that the second-look can provide an important prognostic evaluation in patients without evidence of disease after chemotherapy for ovarian cancer stages III-IV."

Without ingenuity, medicine and surgical skills would advance slowly. This anecdotal report is presented not only as information but as a stimulus to the endoscopist to consider new approaches to today's surgical problems. The laparoscope has been used to: 1. remove ectopic pregnancies, excise paraovarian cysts and retrieve foreign objects from the abdomen. 2. explore the abdomen for suspected trauma, 3. evaluate the abdomen and pleural cavity for metastatic disease, and 4. perform lumbar sympathectomy. These and other unusual uses of the laparoscope are presented for the ""spelunkers"" of modern-day endoscopy."

CD009786,0,1835528,0,Indications and general techniques for lasers in advanced operative laparoscopy.,"Lasers are but one of the several energy delivery systems used by the operative laparoscopist in the performance of advanced operative laparoscopy. Safety is a key factor in the selection of a laser because the tissue damage produced by this instrument is absolutely predictable. The surgeon must be totally familiar with the chosen wavelength and its tissue reaction if this safety factor is to be realized. Other instruments complement the use of lasers in advanced operative laparoscopy, and without thorough knowledge of all available techniques and instruments, the operative laparoscopist will not achieve the full potential of this specialty. It is beyond the scope of this issue on gynecologic laser surgery to present all of the useful nonlaser techniques. Suffice it to say that we often use laser, loop ligature, sutures, hemoclips, bipolar electricity, hydrodissection, and endocoagulation during the course of a day in the operating room and sometimes during one case. As enthusiasm for advanced operative laparoscopy grows and endoscopic capability increases, more complicated and prolonged surgical feats are reported. Radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy have been performed by the laparoscopic route, and endoscopic management of ovarian tumors also has been reported. At this moment, these must be viewed as ""show and tell"" procedures unsupported by statistics to demonstrate any advantage (or disadvantage) when compared with conventional surgical methods. The time required of advanced operative laparoscopy for any given procedure is certainly an important factor. Prolonged operative and anesthesia time certainly can negate the supposed benefit of small incisions and minimally invasive surgery. What goes on inside the abdomen is certainly the most important part of advanced operative laparoscopy. Good surgeons must recognize their own limitations and the limitations of available technology. The operative laparoscopist must know when to quit and institute a laparotomy. In general, when the magnitude of the operative laparoscopy greatly increases the time required to perform the surgery or exceeds the capability of the surgeon, laparotomy is necessary. Patients should never be promised that an operation will be done by laparoscopy. In advanced operative laparoscopy, informed consent means that the patient has had a reasonable explanation of the method, its benefits and its dangers, and has also been told that laparotomy is always a possibility. In our large series, the laparotomy rate is about 3%. It is also wise not to promise the patient that advanced operative laparoscopy will be done by the laser.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009786,0,8587744,0,An overview of consumer-driven ambulatory surgery: operative laparoscopy.,"Laparoscopy is considered one of the first truly consumer-driven medical advances. It is estimated that 30% to 70% of all gynecologic surgery currently performed via laparotomy incision could be completed by using the laparoscope. The emerging trend in recent years is the change from using the laparoscope in gynecology for diagnosis and tubal sterilization to treating ectopic pregnancy and ovarian neoplasm. The 1991 and 1992 Gynecologic and Obstetrical Society's review and recommendations of this surgical specialty reflect a 1.5-fold increase in the number of laparoscopic procedures reported in 1988. Pelvic pain is the most frequent indication for operative laparoscopy. There is a need for further evaluation of laparoscopy, including an evaluation of cost-savings claims and an evaluation of necessary recovery time in comparison with laparotomy. Primary care providers can effectively monitor patients' potential surgical needs and appropriately counsel patients when armed with knowledge of the benefits and risks of operative laparoscopy. This article provides a review of the history, purpose, benefits, risks, and patient surgical outcomes of operative laparoscopy."

Whilst a clear pathogenetic role for endometriosis resulting in tubo-ovarian distortion and infertility is obvious, a causal role for mild endometriosis in infertility has not been established. Any one of several factors may result in both endometriosis and infertility. Nevertheless, endometriosis is best treated at the time of diagnosis in order to limit progression of the disease. The preferred method of treatment is medical, with surgery being reserved for those endometriotic lesions not responding to medical treatment. Conservative surgery will not eradicate microscopic foci, and it is possible that the surgery itself may result in adhesion formation. The choice of medication should be individualized, as the side-effects may not be readily tolerated by some women. Maintenance of amenorrhoea may not be essential to therapeutic efficacy, as normally sited and ectopically sited endometrial tissue may respond to hormonal manipulation in different ways."

We report on a 6-year-old girl with signs of precocious pseudo-puberty and an abdominal tumour. Work-up revealed premature thelarche, vaginal discharge, elevated estrogen levels, and a solid tumour in the lower pelvis (6 x 4 x 3 cm in MRI). The girl underwent laparoscopy (3 ports, 5-mm instruments), during which a non-invasive, mobile tumour of the left ovary was found. Since all margins of resection could be clearly identified, salpingo-oophrectomy was performed, using the harmonic scalpel for dissection and 5-mm clips to ligate the fallopian tube. Histopathology revealed a JGCT with an intact capsule (FIGO 1 a) which required no further chemotherapy. Within 3 months postoperatively the girl's signs of precocious puberty had resolved and at present, after a follow-up of more than 3 years, there is no evidence of tumour recurrence. Minimally invasive surgery of solid ovarian tumours in children remains controversial. However in the present case, laparoscopic resection did not compromise the surgical and oncological safety."

In the laparoscopy group, the average size of the ovarian masses was smaller, and there was a significant reduction in the intraoperative blood loss, postoperative analgesic requirement, morbidity (particularly febrile morbidity and urinary retention), length of hospital stay, and recuperation period. The incidence of rupture of the ovarian mass was not related to the operative approach but to the underlying pathology. Two patients in the laparoscopy group were converted to laparotomy, and 1 in the laparotomy group required a second laparotomy.

CD009786,0,7988849,0,"[When may, should, must the ovary by removed--with which technique?].","The growing demand for minimally invasive operative processes and the unmistakable progress in pelviscopy, have led to an extension of the indications for minimally invasive surgery. At the same time, the operative treatment of ovarian cysts is the third most frequently performed pelviscopic operation. The indication for ovarectomy depends, above all, on anamnestic factors, the clinical findings and the results of pre-operative vaginal sonography. In the event of inadequate hormone secretion by the ovaries, the indication for organ removal should be generously applied. Vaginal sonography is not capable of proving or excluding the existence of a malignancy with 100% certainty. The average rate of ovarian carcinomas is 2.6% in case of smooth-walled, unicamerate cysts. Pelviscopy is also unable to differentiate reliably between benign and malignant ovarian tumours. With the aid of pelviscopic operative processes, a cystic ovarian tumour cannot be extirpated in toto with the necessary certainty. In spite of the conflicting results in the literature, an iatrogenic rupture of an early ovarian carcinoma can be expected to result in worsening the prognosis. The Department of Obstet. Gynecol. University of Göttingen, adopted the following procedure: 1. A (mini-) laparotomy with immediate section for microscopic examination is always performed on sonographically suspect ovarian tumours. 2. On smooth-walled unicamerate ovarian tumours > or = 3 cm which persist or fail to respond to treatment with oral contraceptives, (mini-) laparotomy is performed with complete extirpation of the cystic ovarian tumour and immediate section for microscopic examination; a conceivable alternative is, if possible, total pelviscopic extirpation of the ovarian cyst with immediate section for microscopic examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009786,0,20666969,0,Primary and bilateral tubal carcinoma is associated with long-standing granulomatous inflammation and primary infertility: a case report.,We report a case of bilateral and primary tubal carcinoma associated with granulomatous inflammation and long-standing primary infertility. A 38-year-old woman with a 17-year history of primary infertility presented with lower abdominal pain and granulomatous inflammation in the endometrial biopsy. Bilateral adnexal masses measuring 4 and 6 cm in size were detected and the serum cancer antigen 125 level was 141 IU/ml. Laparoscopic surgical exploration and frozen section on the resected tubes revealed bilateral fallopian tube adenocarcinoma and then a staging laparotomy was performed. Histopathological examination showed a primary bilateral Grade 2 tubal serous adenocarcinoma of Stage 1b associated with granulomatous salpingitis. Primary fallopian tube carcinomas in young women are extremely rare gynecological tumors that are infrequently diagnosed prior to surgical exploration and their cause is unknown. A definitive diagnosis could be made on the histopathological examination in our case with the evidence of chronic pelvic inflammation. Our findings suggest that chronic pelvic inflammation may play a role in carcinogenesis in the tubes of infertile women.
CD009786,0,7867272,0,The potential value of magnetic resonance imaging in infertility.,"The potential value of magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool in infertility was investigated. Twenty-six women with primary or secondary infertility and symptoms of dysmenorrhoea or menorrhagia were studied prospectively using conventional T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo techniques. Positive diagnoses were obtained in 20 of 26 (76.9%) patients. Of these, 18 (69.2%) had lesions likely to be significantly contributing to infertility. Adenomyosis was detected in 14 patients (53.8%) with 11 showing the diffuse pattern while three had discrete adenomyomas. Cystic lesions typical of endometriosis were detected in seven patients (26.9%), four of these also had evidence of adenomyosis. The endometriotic lesions were also seen at laparoscopy in each case. Five patients (19.2%) had leiomyomas, one in a patient with adenomyosis and endometriosis and one in a patient with endometriosis alone. Only one patient had submucous leiomyomas causing significant distortion of the endometrial mucosa likely to affect fertility. Magnetic resonance imaging is valuable in the investigation of unexplained infertility where it provides a high diagnostic yield particularly if uterine pathology is suspected."

The clinical records of 219 patients were studied. In 7 of 43 patients (16%) who had undergone laparoscopy and 3 of 30 patients (10%) who had undergone paracentesis previous to the primary debulking, an abdominal wall metastasis had developed at the entry sites. All metastases occurred in patients with FIGO stage IIIC-IV including ascites. Survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that after adjustment for age, FIGO stage, histology, grade, ascites, and residual disease after primary debulking, the presence of abdominal wall metastases in the entry sites of previous laparoscopy or paracentesis was negatively, although not statistical significantly, correlated with survival (P = 0.14)."
CD009786,0,19543903,0,Posterior colpotomy revisited: a forgotten route for retrieving larger benign ovarian lesions following laparoscopic excision.,"Although simple, ovarian cysts can be decompressed (within an impermeable pouch) following laparoscopic excision to allow lesions of up to 10 cm to be delivered safely. It is more difficult to remove solid or semi-solid ovarian tumours (such as fibromas and dermoid cysts) through this route. We present a modification of laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal retrieval of ovarian tumours through a posterior colpotomy incision (in a bag) and suggest that this is a route that allows large specimens to be retrieved safely and with minimal spillage."

We describe the fourth case reported in the literature of Sister Mary Joseph's nodule originating from fallopian tube carcinoma. In a 54-year-old woman, Sister Mary Joseph's nodule was unexpectedly detected during umbilical hernia repair. Subsequent laparoscopy revealed a 2-cm friable tumor located at the fimbriated end of right fallopian tube and 1-cm peritoneal implant in the pouch of Douglas. Laparoscopic bilateral adnexectomy and resection of the peritoneal implant were performed. Because frozen section examination revealed fallopian tube carcinoma, the procedure was continued with laparotomy including total abdominal hysterectomy, omentectomy, and pelvic lymph node sampling. Final diagnosis was stage IIIB fallopian tube carcinoma. The patient received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent carboplatin and has remained alive and with no evidence of disease. It is concluded that in cases of Sister Mary Joseph's nodule, laparoscopy can be a useful tool in the search of the primary tumor in the abdomen and/or pelvis. Laparoscopy can provide crucial information with respect to the location, size, and feasibility of optimal surgical resection of the intraabdominal and/or pelvic tumors."

Subgroups of young patients with early stage ovarian cancer, endometrial carcinoma and cervical carcinoma may be considered to be at relatively low risk of recurrence and may be treated conservatively with the aim to preserve fertility when this is of prime concern. Unilateral adnexectomy with preservation of the contralateral ovary and uterus may be appropriate for some patients with epithelial ovarian cancers, and certainly should be the procedure of choice for those young women with borderline tumors and early stage sex cord-stromal and malignant germ cell tumors. Administration of high-dose progestins may obviate the need for immediate hysterectomy in a young patient with a well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma desirous of childbearing. The performance of vaginal radical trachelectomy in conjunction with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomies has emerged as a real breakthrough for a highly select group of young women with early invasive tumors of the cervix. In this review, we also discuss reproductive strategies for women who experience chemotherapy-induced ovulatory failure and also address the potential for ovarian cortex cryopreservation and transplantation, and uterine transplantation, all of which are looming on the horizon."

In two patients double haemangiomas of the liver were removed. So the number of resected haemangiomas was 10. The size of these haemangiomas was 2, 2, 3, 3.5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6.5 and 16 cm respectively, average 5.7 cm. Diagnosis was established by ultrasonography, computed tomography, blood pool 99m-technetium-scintigraphy, laparoscopy and selective angiography. Indications for the operation were: palpable tumour and pain in 2 patients; suspected liver metastases secondary to colon cancer 7 years after right colectomy; suspicion to primary haematoma of the liver and suspicion to secondary liver tumour in a patient with a big tumour of the left ovary. Incidental ultrasonic finding of the liver tumour occurred in a patient with obstructive jaundice. In a female with Bartter's syndrome ultrasonography and explorative surgery were carried out in order to reveal endocrine tumour (reninoma), as well as an occasional finding during cholecystectomy. Various operative techniques were performed in these 5 patients: 3 left lobectomies, 1 segmentectomy of the V and the VI liver segments, and 3 atypical resections. The only postoperative complication in our series was a mild superficial variceal thrombophlebitis of the leg in one female patient which disappeared on conservative treatment.

I assessed the usefulness of fat saturated MRI in detecting small endometrial implants by comparing it with conventional MRI. Seventy-four patients with clinically suspected endometriosis were referred for MRI. In every patient, laparoscopy or laparotomy was performed. MRI was performed with a 1.5T superconducting magnet with spin echo T1, T2 and fat saturated T1 weighted images. Surgery revealed a normal pelvis in 6 patients, endometriosis in 65, and cystic lesions in three others. With fat saturated MRI, overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 87.7%, 66.7%, 95.0% and 42.9%, respectively. At surgery, 160 pigmented lesions of endometriosis were detected. Conventional MRI permitted identification of almost all ovarian endometriomas > 10mm in diameter, as with fat saturated MRI. With conventional MRI, 18 endometrial implant lesions < 10mm in diameter were detected. Including those detected by fat saturated MRI, altogether 42 lesions were detected. Conventional MRI demonstrated only 3 lesions among the 48 blueberry spots, but the additional fat saturated MRI technique increased the detection rate to 21 out of 48. Fat saturated MRI can therefore be used for detecting small endometrial implants."

CD009786,0,1729791,0,Value of lipid- and water-suppression MR images in distinguishing between blood and lipid within ovarian masses.,"The distinction between blood and lipid in ovarian masses on MR imaging is important in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. However, this is often difficult on routine MR images because both blood and lipid within tumors can have the same signal intensity as subcutaneous fat. Accordingly, we studied the value of lipid- and water-suppression MR images in making this distinction in 16 patients (21 lesions). As proved by surgery (six patients) or laparoscopy (10 patients), there were 16 endometriomas, one hemorrhagic leiomyosarcoma, and four lipid-containing mature cystic teratomas. The signal intensity in all 17 hemorrhagic lesions was greater than that of subcutaneous fat on lipid-suppression images and less than that of fat on water-suppression images. This compared with the signal intensity of the four lesions that contained lipid, in which the signal intensity was similar to that of subcutaneous fat on both the lipid- and water-suppression images. Thus, the lipid- and water-suppression MR images allowed an accurate distinction between the two. Our experience suggests that the appearance of blood and lipid in ovarian tumors is sufficiently different on lipid- and water-suppression MR images to allow an accurate distinction between the two. The two techniques should be useful in the differential diagnosis of such lesions by MR imaging."

In up to 40% of these patients laparoscopic findings are negative. As a result, many gynecologists frequently excise portions of the uterosacral ligaments and biopsy inconspicuous pelvic lesions in an effort to perform uterosacral nerve ablation and also to identify subclinical endometriosis. During diagnostic laparoscopy for chronic intermittent pelvic and abdominal pain, a 37-year-old woman was noted to have an incidental, 5-mm, pink-white nodule in the right uterosacral ligament. Pathologic examination reported features typical of a carcinoid tumor. Further evaluation by computerized tomographic scan and indium-III octreotide scan identified a 1.6-cm lesion in the mesentery.

The authors report a case of a 10-month-old girl with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) who presented with bilateral inguinal hernias. Herniorrhaphy was uneventful. Microscopic examination of the hernia sacs showed exuberant mesothelial hyperplasia containing multiple nests of differentiated glial tissue. Subsequent computed tomography and laparoscopy disclosed normal ovaries with no evidence of intraabdominal or pelvic abnormalities. Gliomatosis peritonei in this case was attributed to transport of glial tissue from the cerebrospinal fluid into the peritoneal cavity via the shunt.

The data were compared with the corresponding serum levels. CA 125 levels in undiluted peritoneal fluid ranged between 41-301 U/mL and were significantly higher than levels in serum, except in cases of ovarian carcinoma. However, when CA 125 of peritoneal fluid was measured at dilutions greater than 1:50, higher antigen levels were measured (1120-31,500 U/mL), with the highest CA 125 values in patients with ovarian carcinoma. Measurements at dilutions of less than 1:50 were also affected but did not show any decreased binding of the antigen. Immunoblotting analysis of serum and peritoneal fluid indicated the presence of two main bands in each. The monoclonal antibody OC 125 reacted strongly with peritoneal fluid CA 125, in agreement with the CA 125 values obtained by immunoradiometric assay using high dilutions. These data suggest that CA 125 measurements in peritoneal fluid are unreliable unless the samples are diluted 1:50 or more. Furthermore, the statistical difference found between patients with benign and malignant tumors and those with leiomyomata uteri and controls suggests that diluted peritoneal fluid could have a role in identifying abnormal antigen levels."

They report 33 cases exclusively treated by laparoscopic surgery in a series of 407 adnexal cysts treated over a 4-year period (April 1988 to April 1992). As regards diagnosis, the principal difficulty is not to miss the odd malignant lesion (1 to 2%) encountered mainly in older women. Technically, the most delicate stage in the operation is extraction of the cyst, especially when it is large and has an important solid component. Provided all precautions are taken in the diagnosis and the operative technique, this new method seems to be quite acceptable as it enables women who carry these lesions, which require excision, to benefit from the well-known advantages of laparoscopic surgery."

CD009786,0,10949421,0,Ovarian masses in the newborn.,"Prenatal sonography uncovers many fetal ovarian masses that previously would have gone unrecognized. This challenges clinicians to learn the natural history of these asymptomatic lesions so as to provide the best care postnatally. Spontaneous resolution of simple ovarian cysts is expected by about 6 months of age, which is attributed to predicted changes in the postnatal hormonal milieu. After birth, levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and estrogen plummet. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) rise until about 3 months of age and then fall as the ""gonadostat"" matures. Although symptomatic cysts demand intervention, simple asymptomatic cysts less than 5 cm in diameter should be left alone but reassessed sonographically. If simple cysts are larger than 5 cm in diameter the risk of torsion may be significant, and intervention often is advocated. However, the risk of torsion versus the likelihood of resolution is not well established. The therapeutic goal for a clinician managing a newborn with a simple ovarian cyst is to maximize ovarian salvage. Aspiration alone may be a reasonable option. The laparascopic approach to the neonatal ovarian cyst provides a view of both ovaries and allows aspiration, unroofing, cystectomy, or ovariectomy. The sonographically complex cyst usually represents adnexal torsion but could be a neoplasm and warrants intervention because the morbidity from untreated neonatal adnexal torsion can be significant beyond loss of the ovary (eg, hemorrhage, peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, or a wandering tumor)."

CD009786,0,6225603,0,Laparoscopy in the management of patients with ovarian carcinoma.,"Since operative evaluations of patients undergoing therapy for ovarian cancer are necessary, the laparoscope will continue to play a role in the management of these patients. However, the sensitivity of the laparoscope for detecting disease either prior to or at the completion of chemotherapy is significantly less than that of laparotomy, and therefore its utility must be more narrowly defined. The morbidity of laparoscopy is low when performed correctly and utilizing techniques to avoid bowel perforation. Most patients require only a brief hospitalization, and those who cannot medically tolerate an extensive laparotomy might be able to undergo a laparoscopy. The major limitations of laparoscopy are the inability to adequately inspect the peritoneal cavity and pelvis in at least one-quarter of patients because of extensive adhesions, to assess retroperitoneal lymph nodes in all patients, and to resect tumour masses necessary to cytoreduce the tumour prior to therapy. The successful performance of interval laparoscopy, however, is predictive of survival and can select a group of patients whose likelihood of recurrence is relatively low (30 per cent) after more than three years. The observation that the majority of patients who have a negative laparoscopy following six months of chemotherapy remain free of disease for several years, suggests that sensitive tumours are most likely to respond during the initial courses of chemotherapy, and that consideration should be given to briefer and more intensive courses of therapy prior to operative evaluation of the patients."

Use of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for monitoring gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has set the standard to which other assays must be compared. Beta hCG and alphafetoprotein have provided useful markers for ovarian germ cell tumors. Recently, a monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay for CA 125 antigen has been used to monitor the treatment of epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Persistent elevation of CA 125 in serum has generally reflected persistence of disease at second look surveillance procedures. CA 125 levels can, however, return to within normal limits and residual disease can be found at laparoscopy or laparotomy. CA 125 shows promise for distinguishing benign from malignant pelvic masses.

CD009786,0,2288867,0,Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of infertile women.,"Infertility can be due to a variety of causes, ranging from genetic or endocrine disturbances to structural abnormalities. Imaging is often used in the evaluation of anatomic abnormalities. The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has greatly improved diagnostic accuracy in the workup of several entities causing infertility. Developmental abnormalities of the reproductive tract are particularly well suited to diagnosis by MRI, which clearly demonstrates the zonal anatomy of the corpus, cervix, and vagina. Correct classification of an anomaly can spare the patient unnecessary laparoscopy or surgery. Leiomyomas, another cause of infertility, are optimally evaluated by MRI, since the size, number, location, and extent of degeneration can be identified. These factors are important in deciding how the leiomyomas will be treated. Adenomyosis can cause uterine enlargement and can be misconstrued as fibroids. MRI is the only noninvasive method that can prospectively diagnose adenomyosis. Ovarian masses can also give rise to infertility. MRI is particularly well suited to clarify whether a mass is uterine or ovarian. It is also much more specific than ultrasound in the differential diagnosis of a mass, especially endometriomas, dermoids, and fibromas. Polycystic ovarian disease, usually diagnosed via hormonal measurements, also has a characteristic appearance on MRI."

Therefore, using clinical characteristics, diagnostic imaging, serum biomarkers or laparoscopic findings, many studies have attempted to find models for predicting surgical resectability. However, most of these prediction models showed limited effectiveness and have not been properly validated. To establish a reliable prediction model, several requirements should be met. First, the goal of surgical cytoreduction should be adequately defined. Second, the desired accuracy for making the model clinically useful should be defined. Third, the model should test all relevant predictors, including clinical, radiological and biochemical predictors, and be developed using a large dataset that provides a sufficient number of events. Fourth, any prediction model should be validated with a relevant external dataset. Lastly, the prediction model should be able to aid decision making and, thereby, improve the outcome of patients.

Explorative laparoscopy was performed revealing an enlarged vermiform appendix with the uterus and adnexa macroscopically normal, and no signs of intraperitoneal metastasis or adnexal torsion. Laparotomic appendectomy followed. Histological examination revealed a mucinous cystadenoma of the vermiform appendix. This clinical entity of appendiceal mucocele should always be considered by gynaecologists as well as gastroenterologists in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting a right-sided adnexal mass on ultrasound in order to choose the best surgical approach."

CD009786,0,2288664,0,Gynecologic applications of MRI.,"Gynecologic anatomy is consistently depicted with MRI. Abnormal developmental anatomy is also well assessed. In cases of complete or partial vaginal agenesis where ultrasound is equivocal, MRI can be definitive. The various subtypes of uterine anomalies are well delineated with MRI. MRI is the optimal technique in the therapeutic evaluation of leiomyomas, because the number, size, location, and degeneration can be documented. It is particularly useful in the identification of the ovaries in the presence of an enlarged leiomyomatous uterus. Adenomyosis, an often neglected diagnosis, is distinguishable from leiomyomas. In the setting of an equivocal ultrasound, MRI is useful in discerning whether a mass is ovarian or uterine in origin. Endometriosis, a disease routinely diagnosed and staged by laparoscopy, does have a typical MR appearance and therefore can usually be differentiated from other adnexal masses. Dermoids are readily diagnosed with MRI. Other adnexal masses do not have a specific MR appearance and morphologic criteria as used with ultrasound or CT must be relied upon in suggesting whether or not the mass is benign or malignant. MRI is the procedure of choice in the staging of cervical and endometrial cancer."

We studied 136 consecutive cyst fluids (108 benign, 28 malignant) and correlated the findings with the tissue diagnosis. All three antigens were very low (CEA, less than 0.5 ng/ml; CA125, 55-2,143 mu/ml; and AFP, less than 4.8 ng/ml) in follicular and lutein cysts. Markedly elevated CA125 (296-1,950,000 mu/ml) and low CEA (0.5-220 ng/ml) and AFP (less than 4.8 ng/ml) levels were seen in patients with serous neoplasms, both benign and malignant. Elevated CEA (greater than 600 ng/ml) and CA125 (56-65,330 mu/ml) levels were seen in primary mucinous cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma. Two patients with colonic carcinoma metastatic to the ovary had an elevated CEA (greater than 600 ng/ml) and a normal CA125. Only one patient, with a malignant teratoma, had an elevated AFP. The adjunctive use of CEA and CA125 is recommended for the classification of ovarian cysts."
CD009786,0,3493176,0,Interleukin-1: a possible role in the infertility associated with endometriosis.,"Increased numbers of activated macrophages are associated with mild endometriosis. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a protein produced by macrophages and is believed to be a primary mediator of host responses. IL-1 induces prostaglandin and fibrinogen synthesis and stimulates fibroblast proliferation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of IL-1 in the infertility associated with mild endometriosis. Peritoneal fluid (PF) was obtained at laparoscopy from 11 patients with minimal or mild endometriosis and from 7 women undergoing tubal ligation. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured for 24 hours. Peritoneal and macrophage culture fluids were studied for IL-1 activity, which was measured with the EL-4 assay. IL-1 activity was present in the PF of 10 of the 11 patients with endometriosis and 11 of the 11 macrophage culture fluids and was absent in the PF and macrophage culture fluid of the tubal ligation patients. The effect of recombinant alpha-IL-1 on the in vitro growth of 2-cell mouse embryos was also studied. IL-1 in concentrations similar to those present in the PF (greater than 1 U/ml) was toxic to mouse embryo development. We conclude that the IL-1 may play a role in the infertility associated with endometriosis."

The accuracy in detecting signs of adhesion and parietal infiltration of the large bowel was 76.3%, due to the limited size of most of the lesions. Forty-seven of the 72 patients underwent a double contrast enema and laparoscopy during presurgical staging: accuracy in detecting lesions was the same for both examinations (80.4%).

CD009786,0,11140864,0,Laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy.,"In the last decade, operative laparoscopic procedures are performed increasingly in both gynecology and general surgery. The major advantages of this newer minimally invasive approach are: decreased postoperative morbidity, less pain and decreased need for analgesics, early normal bowel function, shorter hospital stay, and early return to normal activity. With the advancement of laparoscopic surgery, its use during pregnancy is becoming more widely accepted. The most commonly reported laparoscopic operation during pregnancy is laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Other laparoscopic procedures commonly performed during pregnancy include: management of adnexal mass, ovarian torsion, ovarian cystectomy, appendectomy, and ectopic pregnancy. The possible drawbacks of laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy may include injury of the pregnant uterus and the technical difficulty of laparoscopic surgery due to the growing mass of the gravid uterus. Also, the potential risk of decreased uterine blood flow secondary to the increase in intraabdominal pressure and the possible risk of carbon dioxide absorption to both the mother and fetus should be taken into account. To date, data on laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy are insufficient to draw conclusions on its safety and exact complication rate. This is due to the few cases reported and the lack of prospective studies. Furthermore, there is a common tendency to underreport unsuccessful cases. Finally, most reports in the literature come from centers and surgeons with special interest, experience, and skills in laparoscopy, and their results may not reflect the real complication rates. We have reviewed the pertinent English literature from the last decade. The cumulative experience suggests that laparoscopic surgery may be performed safely during pregnancy, although more studies are needed to establish its exact rate of adverse events."

First, the results of these 254 cycles were compared with 174 cycles involving patients with proven non-endometriotic tubal infertility having similar age and body mass index. Women with ovarian endometriosis had a significantly higher cancellation rate, but similar pregnancy, implantation and delivery rates as patients with tubal infertility. Second, among the women with ovarian endometriosis, the women with a history of laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometriomas prior to IVF and no visual endometriosis at ovum pick-up (n = 112) were compared with the non-operated women and visual endometriomas at ovum pick-up (n = 142). Patients who underwent ovarian surgery before IVF had significantly shorter period, lower antral follicle count and required higher gonadotropin doses than patients with non-operated endometriomas. The two groups of women with a previous or present ovarian endometriosis did, however, have similar pregnancy, implantation and live birth rates. In conclusion, ovarian endometriosis does not reduce IVF outcome compared with tubal factor. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins."

CD009786,0,17054259,0,Laparoscopic surgery for presumed benign ovarian tumor during pregnancy.,"The surgical management of ovarian tumors in pregnancy is similar to that of non-pregnant women. The procedures include resection of the tumor (enucleation), removal of an ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy), or surgical excision of the fallopian tube and ovary (salpingo-oophorectomy). The procedure can be done by open surgery (laparotomy) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) technique. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery include shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activity, and reduced postoperative pain. However, conventional laparoscopic surgery techniques required the infusion of gas carbon dioxide in the peritoneum to distend the abdomen and displace the bowel upward to create the room for surgical manipulation. Serious complications such as abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the circulating blood (hypercarbia) and perforation of internal organs have also been reported. These serious complication may be harmful to the fetus."

Patients with a pelvic mass and an omental cake and/or large-volume ascites were selected for open laparoscopy. One hundred and seventy-three patients with stage III or IV ovarian carcinoma underwent diagnostic open laparoscopy. Seventy-one patients underwent complete excision of port sites at the time of debulking surgery. Thirty (17%) patients developed port-site metastases. However, only 8 (5%) of these port-site metastases were clinically diagnosed, while 22 out of 71 (31%) with complete port-site excision were diagnosed on pathologic examination. There was no significant relationship between the development of port-site metastases and median time to primary chemotherapy or surgery, the presence of ascites, or stage IV disease. All port-site metastases disappeared during primary therapy, and none of the patients developed a second relapse in one of their port sites. We observed a high rate of port-site metastases after laparoscopy in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma. However, prognosis was not worse in this group of patients. Laparoscopy is a convenient technique to diagnose advanced ovarian carcinoma, to exclude other primary tumors, and to refer patients to a tertiary center."

CD009786,0,2501110,0,Administration of nasal Buserelin as compared with subcutaneous Buserelin implant for endometriosis.,"One hundred infertile patients with laparoscopically confirmed ovarian endometriosis were treated with either intranasal (IN) Buserelin (Hoechst, AG, Frankfurt am Main, West Germany) (300 micrograms three times a day) or subcutaneous (SC) Buserelin implant (6.6 mg Buserelin). Serum estradiol was suppressed in the menopausal range in both groups, but the inhibition of the pituitary ovarian axis appeared more profound and consistent in the SC group than in the IN group. Laparoscopic findings proved that the SC Buserelin emerged superior to the IN Buserelin. Indeed, the score of endometriotic lesions and the ovarian cyst diameter were more reduced in the SC group than in the IN group. Moreover, the histologic study showed a lower incidence of active endometriosis and a lower mitotic index of ovarian endometrial epithelium in the SC group than in the IN group. In conclusion, the release of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist by a biodegradable implant achieved better efficacy in reducing endometriotic lesions than the IN mode of administration."

A staging examination under anesthetic was performed. Preoperatively, 60-MBq technetium-labeled nannocolloid was injected in the mucosa at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock just adjacent to the tumor recurrence. Three sentinel nodes were detected, respectively, in the left obturator fossa (two) and the right external iliac region, using a laparoscopic probe (Navigator) and removed for pathological assessment. As they proved to be negative, the patient underwent a total vaginectomy, parametrectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. The tumor was completely removed, and all lymph nodes proved to be negative. The accuracy of sentinel node identification in patients with recurrent gynecological tumors needs further evaluation. This unique case shows that sentinel node detection is possible after previous radiotherapy and surgery and hopes to stimulate further research in this field."

However, in rare cases, patients can present with large masses and radiographic suggestion of malignancy. We present the case of a 76-year-old white female, 23 months after bilateral salpino-oophorectomy at the same institution, complaining of 3.5 months of right flank and abdominal pain. Clinical and radiological evidence of a right ovarian remnant was discovered. Subsequent laparoscopic resection was consistent with a well-encapsulated mucinous adenocarcinoma in a right ovarian remnant. Curiously, this patient had no history of endometriosis, dense pelvic adhesions, pelvic inflammatory disease, or difficulty encountered during the original hysterectomy. This is the seventh published case report in the international literature about carcinoma developing in an ovarian remnant. However, this case differs in that the patient had no preexisting gynecologic conditions at the time of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to account for residual ovarian tissue. Additionally, the oophorectomy was performed vaginally, in contrast to multiple previous case reports."

Second-look surgery was carried out in the following situations: (1) tumor elements found in the washings of the peritoneum in Douglas' space and high blood-serum levels of CA-125 (8 patients with stage I-II tumors, in clinical remission); (2) during remission, after 6-10 courses of polychemotherapy (13 patients with stage III-IV tumors); (3) during remission, after non-radical primary surgery (117); (4) suspected recurrence (144); (5) recurrence-free surgical pathology, e.g. ventral hernia, requiring laparotomy (22). Patients without repeated laparotomy (199) were in control. During remission, surveillance can be carried out using cytologic, ultrasound and immunoradiologic techniques since laparoscopy fails. The latter is useful, for diagnostic purposes, in case of discrepancy between clinical and ultrasound evidence as well as during monitoring in patients in clinical remission who show unfavorable levels of CA-125 and poor results of sonographic. Laparotomy is indicated prior to chemotherapy of inoperable tumors for morphologic verification of diagnosis. Indications for second-look operations can be significantly decreased considering the latest improvements in non-invasive monitoring technique.

Thirteen women presented acutely. Family history of breast, ovary or colon cancer was not ascertained in any of the women. None had CA125 levels performed. In 22 cases, the cyst was aspirated; only 10 of these had follow-up ultrasound. Laparotomy was performed in 25 premenopausal women, the two perimenopausal women and eight postmenopausal women. Average cyst size was 71 mm (range 40-80 mm) in the laparoscopy group, and 72 mm (range 36-180 mm) in the laparotomy group. After initial diagnosis at ultrasound, a follow-up scan was performed 4-16 weeks later. The final diagnosis was ovarian neoplasm in 13 and hydrosalpinx in two. None had a malignancy. Documentation at ultrasound was often inadequate, and management of the women with an ovarian cyst was haphazard. Guidelines on management of simple ovarian cysts are likely to improve clinical practice."
CD009786,0,23024155,0,"Diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of borderline ovarian tumors.","Borderline ovarian tumors represent a heterogeneous group of noninvasive tumors of uncertain malignant potential with characteristic histology. They occur in younger women, are present at an early stage, and have a favorable prognosis, but symptomatic recurrence and death may be found as long as 20 years after therapy in some patients. The molecular changes in borderline ovarian tumors indicate linkage of this disease to type I ovarian tumors (low-grade ovarian carcinomas). The pathological stage of disease and subclassification of extraovarian disease into invasive and noninvasive implants, together with the presence of postoperative macroscopic residual disease, appear to be the major predictor of recurrence and survival. However, it should be emphasized that the most important negative prognostic factor for recurrence is just the use of conservative surgery, but without any impact on patient survival because most recurrent diseases are of the borderline type-easily curable and with an excellent prognosis. Borderline tumors are difficult masses to correctly preoperatively diagnose using imaging methods because their macroscopic features may overlap with invasive and benign ovarian tumors. Over the past several decades, surgical therapy has shifted from a radical approach to more conservative treatment; however, oncologic safety must always be balanced. Follow-up is essential using routine ultrasound imaging, with special attention paid to the remaining ovary in conservatively treated patients. Current literature on this topic leads to a number of controversies that will be discussed thoroughly in this article, with the aim to provide recommendations for the clinical management of these patients."

CD009786,0,1827651,0,Surgical indications in antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts.,"The antenatal diagnosis of ovarian cysts poses a therapeutic dilemma because the natural history of these lesions is not well known. A retrospective review from 1980 to 1989 showed 29 ovarian cysts in 27 patients diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography performed between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Nineteen cysts were initially observed. Eleven cysts resolved (diameter less than 2 cm), three are decreasing, three were lost to follow-up, and two underwent resection. Eight patients underwent surgical exploration immediately following birth. The diagnosis of benign ovarian cyst was confirmed histologically in all cases. A review of the literature showed an additional 230 cases of antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts. Simple cysts of the ovary tend to resolve spontaneously and, therefore, may be treated conservatively. Serial ultrasonography allows accurate diagnosis and long-term assessment of ovarian cysts in the neonate and may prevent unnecessary oophorectomy. Patients with cysts larger than 4 cm may be candidates for percutaneous aspiration, or should undergo removal of the cyst because of a significant risk of torsion. Complex cystic masses, symptomatic ovarian cysts, and cysts that do not resolve should be removed."

The patients were placed in the lithotomy position after sedation and a veres needle was inserted in the posterior vaginal vault. A trocar followed and warm normal saline was injected into the pelvis. The needle was removed and a telescope connected to a light source and monitor was introduced. Excellent visualization was achieved in all cases examined and the average time of TVL was 30 min. All patients except one found TVL a simple and painless procedure. TVL helped in the diagnosis of six benign ovarian lesions and ruled out OC in the other 17 cases. TVL is an easy method to learn with reliable results. TVL can reduce the number of unnecessary laparoscopies and/or laparotomies and it seems to be useful in ruling out OC.

CD009786,0,19204659,0,[The role of laparoscopy in ovarian carcinoma].,"The role of minimally invasive surgery in the management of gynecologic cancers is continuously expanding. Although few trials have focused on the safety of laparoscopy in oncology, laparoscopy is now widely used for most gynecological malignancies. Laparoscopy is widely used to manage benign ovarian masses, but its role in managing ovarian cancer still needs to be defined. The role of laparoscopy in ovarian cancer surgery may be divided into three following categories: 1) laparoscopic staging of apparent early ovarian cancer; 2) laparoscopic assessment of disease extent and potential for resectability; 3) laparoscopic reassessment, or second-look operation, or rule out recurrence. Laparoscopic approach has shown several advantages like a reduction in operating time, blood loss, hospital stay, and total hospital charges. The limitations of laparoscopic practice include inadequate port-site metastasis, tumour dissemination due to cyst rupture and incomplete staging. In addition, there were limitations in performing extensive laparoscopic sampling of areas of tumor persistence including retroperitoneal lymph nodes. In literature there are no randomized studies assessing the use of laparoscopy in the management of ovarian cancer. Moreover, most of the studies in literature comparing laparoscopy and laparotomy are carried out by surgeons specialized in one of two approaches, so that the results can not be compared."

Ovarian cancer on the other hand, although rare in this age group, is the most common genital tract malignancy. The purpose of this study was to define imaging characteristics of ovarian masses in adolescents between 12 and 21 years old and correlate imaging and surgical findings. Thirty-seven female adolescent patients aged between 12 and 21 years were operated on because of a diagnosed ovarian mass between 1997 and 2002. All patients underwent pelvic ultrasound, five had an abdominal CT scan, two had abdominal MRI, one abdominal X-ray and one intravenous pyelography. Ultrasound was used to define the size of the lesion and to characterize its gross morphologic condition as solid, simple cyst or complex cyst. The records were reviewed for age at presentation, presenting symptoms, diagnostic studies, surgical procedure and pathology findings, which were available for all patients. In our study 32 patients (86.5%) were symptomatic and five asymptomatic (13.5%). The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (59.5%). Thirty-four patients (91.1%) had benign lesions, two had malignant tumors (5.4%) and one patient had a borderline lesion (2.7%). The most common ovarian masses detected were germ cell tumors (27.5%) and functional cysts (25%). Twenty patients (54%) underwent operative laparoscopy and 17 patients (46%) exploratory laparotomy. Simple resection of the ovarian mass was achieved in the majority of cases (84%). Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed in only one case (2.7%)."

CD009786,0,8706964,0,Ovarian cysts.,"The Author intends to compare the data available in literature on the topic of 'laparoscopic surgery of ovarian cysts' to his case material. From 1985 to 1994, the author carried out 920 laparoscopic operations for the removal of ovarian cysts. Of these, 13 were converted to laparotomies, mostly because of peri-adnexal adhesions. There were 22 recurrences (endometriosic and mucinous multilocular cysts), and five severe complications (two purulent inflammations, one intra-operative haemorrhage and one post-operative one, one post-operative acute abdomen sine causa). In one case, an unrecognised endometrioid carcinoma was inadequately treated with laparoscopy. The author considers laparoscopy as the elective choice for surgical treatment of ovarian cysts. Suspect malignancy is not a contra-indication to laparoscopic surgery, since the removal of the operative specimen and its subsequent histological examination can be effected-in the large majority of cases-with the same results both laparoscopically and laparotomically. There is a problem with undiagnosed carcinomas in fertile females, but it is equally present in laparotomy."

CD009786,0,12886864,0,Prophylactic surgery in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome.,"The hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome is responsible for approximately 5% of all breast cancers and 10% of all ovarian cancers. Although this accounts for a small portion of these diseases, much attention has been focused on this syndrome because of the abundance of research in this area. The majority of the hereditary breast/ovarian syndrome can be attributed to germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Reliable screening techniques for these mutations have been developed and are readily available in clinical practice. For patients who are thought to have the hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome based on family history or genetic testing, options exist for either intensive screening or prophylactic surgery. This review will discuss the mechanisms by which mutations in the BRCA genes lead to the development of cancer, the limitations of currently available screening techniques, and the efficacy of prophylactic surgery. In general, prophylactic oophorectomy can be performed laparoscopically as an outpatient procedure, carrying as its main drawback the associated consequence of surgical menopause. Prophylactic mastectomy is quite effective in reducing the risk of breast cancer but is a more extensive surgical procedure and results in disfigurement. For any given patient, the best estimates of individual risk of breast or ovarian cancer should be weighed against the benefits of prophylactic surgery and the patient's personal wishes."

CD009786,0,22321906,0,Borderline ovarian tumours.,"Borderline ovarian tumours account for 10-20% of all epithelial ovarian cancer. Historically, standard primary surgery has included borderline ovarian tumours, omentectomy, peritoneal washing and multiple biopsies. As one-third of borderline ovarian tumours are diagnosed in women under the age of 40 years, fertility-sparing treatment has been more frequently used in the past 10 years. Fertility drugs are well tolerated in women with infertility after fertility-sparing surgery. Careful selection of candidates is necessary. Laparoscopic techniques can be used, but should be reserved for oncologic surgeons. This conservative treatment increases the rate of recurrence, albeit with no effect on survival. The pregnancy rate is nearly 50%, and most are achieved spontaneously. These women should be closely followed up. The question is whether this is acceptable from a gynaecologic oncologic point of view. For this reason, we will discuss recently published studies and gynaecologic oncologic concerns about the mode of fertility-sparing surgery and its consequences."

CD009786,0,8727704,0,Indications for laparoscopic surgery of ovarian tumors.,"To investigate the criteria for laparoscopic surgery in ovarian tumors, a retrospective review of indications, preoperative assessments using transvaginal ultrasonography, serum CA 125, surgical methods and diagnosis and post-operative complications were analyzed. Forty-three patients underwent surgical treatment for ovarian tumors, from November 1992 to October 1993. Of the 43 patients with ovarian tumors, 19 (44%) underwent laparoscopic surgery, and 24 (56%) underwent laparotomy. Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 18 of 34 (53%) patients with benign ovarian cysts. Eight patients with malignant ovarian tumors were treated by laparotomy. Coincidence of preoperative assessment and surgical diagnosis was 95%. No major complications were observed in the laparoscopic surgery. We suggest that malignant ovarian tumors and inextricable adhesions are contraindications to laparoscopic surgery. We propose the following criteria for laparoscopic surgery by classification into three groups: A) good indication: benign cystic tumors with good mobility, B) deliberation indication: benign tumors with poor mobility, including some dermoid cysts and endometrial cysts, C) contraindication: malignant tumors and dense adhesions. We conclude that indications of laparoscopic surgery for ovarian tumors should be determined by careful preoperative assessment using transvaginal ultrasonography and tumor markers."

They may be missed even on direct inspection during laparotomy or laparoscopy. There are several typical ovarian sonographic signs which are known to occur frequently in women with benign ovarian cystic teratomas. High-resolution sonography can identify the cysts based on their typical sonographic signs. Since these very small dermoid cysts are sometimes undetected by the naked eye during the operation, ultrasonography with particular attention to the signs is very important. We present three cases reports that illustrate the problem and stress the contribution of preoperative sonography in the diagnosis and treatment of such cases."
CD009786,0,11449615,0,[Operative standard therapy of micro- and macro-invasive carcinoma of the cervix].,"Radical hysterectomy with bilateral lymphonodectomy represents one of the most important strategies in the treatment of cervical cancer, especially in early stage disease with small tumor volume. Nowadays, 5-year survival rates of patients with stage IB and IIA range between 87% and 92%. Ovary preserving management in cervical cancer is justified in early stage disease and younger women (< 45 years), and regarded as standard treatment. Therapy of microinvasive cervical cancer (Stage Ia1 und Ia2) depends on depth of invasion, superficial spread of lesion, and other prognostic criteria. Exact work-up of the cone is the basis for successful treatment. A great variety exists in regard to radicality of surgery in patients with cervical cancer--ranging between modified radical hysterectomy and radical hysterectomy with resection of the parametria to both pelvic side walls. Assessment of lymph node status is mandatory for individual treatment. Pelvic lymphonodectomy represents standard treatment at radical hysterectomy, and if positive, paraaortic lymphonodectomy is indicated. Micturition disorders, urinary incontinence, lymph cysts, bowel problems, thrombophlebitis, urogenital fistulas, and pulmonary embolism are the most frequent complications following radical hysterectomy. Today, there is an increasing competition between different therapy strategies in cervical cancer such as primary irradiation, chemoradiation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, laparoscopic radical hysterectomy, vaginal radical hysterectomy combined with laparoscopic surgical staging. All these treatment modalities have to be compared with the ""golden standard"" comprising survival and recurrence rates functional results, morbidity, mortality and quality of life."
CD009786,0,4276392,0,Laparoscopy.,"In the last five years, laparoscopy has become increasingly popular in North America. The procedure has been mainly embraced by the gynecologist and its use in this field has largely supplanted culdoscopy. Other specialties, nevertheless, have been slower in recognizing its value.The procedure has wide applications in gynecology. In pediatrics, laparoscopy proves useful in elucidation of amenorrhea, intersex and precocious puberty. In general surgery, laparoscopy has been recognized as a useful tool in the patient with multiple trauma, and in establishing the diagnosis of many intra-abdominal conditions.Numerous perlaparoscopic operative procedures which include biopsies and tubal sterilizations may be carried out by an experienced operator. Complications associated with the procedure are few, but may be severe. These can be avoided by careful adherence to proper technique."
CD009786,0,3945444,0,Endometriosis: pathogenetic implications of the anatomic distribution.,"The authors have reassessed the anatomic distribution of ectopic endometrium by the laparoscopic study of the location of implants, adhesions, and uterine position in 182 consecutive patients with infertility and endometriosis. The ovary was the most common site of implants with 54.9% having either unilateral or bilateral involvement. This was followed, in order of frequency, by the posterior broad ligament (35.2%), the anterior cul-de-sac (34.6%), the posterior cul-de-sac (34.0%), and the uterosacral ligament (28.0%). Adhesion formation followed the same anatomic distribution. No patients were noted to have endometriosis of the cervix and vagina. Endometriosis of the anterior compartment (anterior cul-de-sac, anterior broad ligament, and anterior uterine serosa) was significantly more common in patients with anterior uteri (40.7%) versus patients with posterior uteri (11.8%, P less than .0005). Exclusive anterior compartment disease was found only in patients with anterior uteri, and significantly more commonly in patients with severely anteflexed uteri (P less than .005). These data suggest that factors influencing implantation of retrograde menstrual debris include: the dependent pooling of peritoneal fluid as affected by uterine position; epithelial cell type at the site of implantation; unique ovarian susceptibility; route of entry; and mobility of the pelvic structures. The data support the Sampson hypothesis of retrograde menstruation as the primary model of development of endometriosis."
CD009786,0,14968063,0,[Surgical treatment for endometriomas].,"Endovaginal ultrasonography is relevant for the diagnosis of ovarian endometriomas with a good predictive value. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be recommended if deep endometriosis is suspected. Operative laparoscopic management is the 'gold standard' for surgical treatment, and medical treatment should not be given before surgery. Peritoneal lavage cytology must be performed before cystectomy. First, the cyst is opened and the endometriosic fluid is aspirated. The stripping technique is performed and after hemostasis, the ovarian cortex is reattached with microsurgical sutures. Coagulation or laser vaporization of endometriomas without excision of the pseudocapsule seems to be associated with a significant increase in risk of cyst recurrence. Recurrent ovarian surgery is not recommended in women with infertility, as it might be deleterious for ovarian reserve."

The extent of disease was assessed by clinical and conventional radiologic examinations, peritoneoscopy with visualization of diaphragmatic leaves, peritoneal cytology, and, in some patients, exploratory laparotomy. The highest incidence of metastases was found in advanced stages (31.1% in stage III and 60% in stage IV) and in recurrences (75.9%). In 87 patients with early disease, the incidence was 9.2%. In 36 pretreated patients with no evidence of disease, this incidence was 11.1%. Biopsies of the nodes were performed in 96 patients: radiologic accuracy was confirmed in 33 of 33 positive and in 55 of 63 negative cases. Of the patients, 33% had metastases only in the pelvic nodes, and 7.9% only in the paraaortic nodes; in 79.1%, both chains were involved simultaneously.

CD009786,0,7736636,0,The role of endovaginal ultrasound in differentiating endometriomas from other ovarian cysts.,"Endometriomas have a prevalence of 24% among all ovarian cysts. Various sonographic features have been proposed to identify endometriomas. Although the visualization of ovarian masses with low-level internal echoes is suggestive for the endometriotic origin of the cyst, no data are yet available on the specificity of endovaginal ultrasonography in differentiating endometriomas from other ovarian masses. To address this issue, the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of endovaginal ultrasonography in comparison with pathology were calculated for each visualized cyst. The study population (n = 251) consisted of all premenopausal non pregnant women submitted to laparotomy or laparoscopy between May 1991 and March 1993 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Cagliari. Within one week before surgery, all patients underwent endovaginal ultrasonography and 93 ovarian cysts were visualized. After the scan, the physician gave prospective impressions as to the presence of endometriomas using the visualization of round-shaped homogeneous hypoechoic ""tissue"" of low-level echoes within the ovary as characteristic ultrasonographic finding. Ultrasonographic impression was compared with histopathological diagnosis. Out of 93 adnexal masses detected by ultrasound, 31 were suspected to be endometriomas and the diagnosis was confirmed in 24. The sensitivity and the specificity of endovaginal ultrasonography in differentiating endometriomas from other ovarian cysts were 83% and 89%, respectively. This specificity (89%) is comparable with that obtainable with magnetic resonance imaging (91%)."

CD009786,0,18946442,0,Pilimiction.,Per urethral hair growth or passage of hair in the urine is a rare urological problem. It is pathognomonic sign of urinary bladder dermoid. Primary bladder dermoid is very rare problem. It could be managed endoscopically when it is limited to detrusor muscle. Secondary dermoid in the urinary bladder is not uncommon among the female specially during their reproductive life. It is mostly ovarian origin. Ovarian dermoid may grow and invade the urinary bladder wall to discharge its content in the urine. Cystoscopic evaluation followed by laparotomy and excision of ovarian dermoid along its extension to the urinary bladder is a rational approach. However if expertise is available it may be managed laparoscopically. Our patient has benign indolent coarse of pilimiction for last 9 years. Except US scans we did not do MRI or CT scan for financial constrain. Keeping an open mind we did cyst evaluation. Attempt of endoscopic resection seems that the dermoid has invaded bladder wall from out side. We did laparotomy in the same sitting. Lt. ovary was almost buried between the leaf of broad ligament and contain a dermoid cyst invading bladder wall to discharge its contents. So we confirm our diagnosis as secondary bladder dermoids as a cause of pilimiction & excise the whole specimen keeping its safety margin. Histopathologically it appears benign mature cystic teratoma.

All patients with theca lutein cysts had significantly elevated serum 17-OHP levels compared to those in 1) normal pregnancy, 2) patients with GTN and normal-size ovaries, 3) patients with metastatic GTN in the absence of ovaries (P less than 0.02). Levels of serum 17-OHP but not P correlated with the degree of ovarian enlargement (r = 0.87, P less than 0.05). Serum P concentrations in patients with theca lutein cysts, although higher than the levels in cases of GTN with normal-size ovaries, were not significantly different from the levels in normal pregnancy (P greater than 0.05). Serum hCG levels in patients with theca lutein cysts, though higher than the normal pregnancy levels (P less than 0.05), were not significantly different from those in cases of GTN with normal-size ovaries and GTN without ovaries (P greater than 0.05). Under the conditions studied, no correlation was observed between serum hCG and P levels in our cases of GTN. Increased serum 17-OHP level in a patient with GTN suggests the presence of theca lutein cysts."

On the basis of their experience the authors address the clinical classification of benign ovarian pathology and the surgical laparoscopic procedures utilised in the treatment of adnexal cysts. Forty-two patients underwent laparoscopic surgery after a preoperative clinical and biological evaluation and imaging in order to exclude the presence of ovarian malignancies. All surgical procedures were carried out laparoscopically, with a conversion index of 0%. The morbidity was 2.3% (one case of haematoma of the umbilical trocar site) and there was no mortality. No late complications were observed. In conclusion, laparoscopic surgery in the management of ovarian cysts is technically feasible. On the basis of these findings laparoscopic surgery is the treatment of choice for adnexal cystic tumours after careful exclusion of malignancy."

Patients with cervical, vaginal, endometrial and ovarian cancer can be managed laparoscopically either for staging or for treating. The feasibility of procedures through the laparoscope (such as hysterectomies, bilateral oophorectomies, pelvic and para aortic lymphadenectomies, omentectomies, colostomies, bowel resections, oophoropexies, radical hysterectomies and ovarian cancer debulking) has been demonstrated by skilled gynaecologists. Many of these procedures have been heralded as avant garde 'surgical standards' without appropriate evaluation of efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency. Larger series of patients have now replaced case reports to try to answer the numerous unanswered questions regarding the value of these procedures. Several prospective trials were begun to compare laparotomy and laparoscopy.

Of 20 oviducts removed after documented sterilization failure (group I), 6 revealed a process compatible with endometriosis. Four of nine previously ligated fallopian tubes removed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (group II) were successfully injected with India ink. In two patients histologic examination demonstrated the India ink in epithelium-lined spaces that lay beyond the muscle of the tubal wall extending from the tubal lumen to the serosal surface. Fifty oviducts were studied in twenty-five patients requesting reversal of their sterilizations (group III). A higher percentage of fistulas was demonstrated in patients with less than 4 cm of remaining proximal tubal segment. Furthermore, most of these fistulas were demonstrated in patients for whom 3 years had elapsed since the original sterilization procedure. Patients sterilzed by laparoscopic cautery methods were observed to have a higher percentage of fistula formation and histologic documentation of endometriosis at the sterilization site as compared with patients sterilized by other methods. Our observations suggest that ligation of the oviduct within 4 cm of the uterine cornu may predispose to the development of endometriosis and subsequent fistula formation in the tip of the ligated oviduct."

Place and modalities of operative laparoscopy.,"The purpose of this study was to discuss the place and the specific modalities of laparoscopic surgery in the management of ovarian dermoid cysts. This retrospective and noncomparative study was carried out in 65 patients who presented dermoid ovarian cyst between January 1986 and December 1990 in our institution. The surgical treatment was performed purely by laparoscopy in 86.2% of the cases (56 patients). The modalities of laparoscopic surgery were as follows: ovariectomy (8 cases; 14.3%), transparietal cystectomy (4 cases; 7.1%) and intraperitoneal cystectomy (44 cases; 78.6%). In 15 cases (15/44 = 34%) the intraperitoneal cystectomy was carried out without opening the cyst and the intact cyst was extracted using an endoscopic impermeable sack. We observed no cases of chemical peritonitis. The risk of recurrence after conservative treatment is 4% (two patients) and out of the ten patients for whom a second-look laparoscopy was performed only two (20%) presented adhesions. Laparoscopic treatment of dermoid ovarian cysts is feasible, safe, and effective. The treatment can be conservative in over 80% of the cases. The specific risk of chemical peritonitis can be countered by a change in the cystectomy technique. The use of an impermeable laparoscopic sack permits extraction of the cyst without any peritoneal contamination."

The clinical manifestations are characteristic of pelvic tumor and the hormonal metabolism is not usually modified. Radiography, employing ultrasound procedures, is the most commonly used pre-surgical detection method but only histological examination makes the diagnosis. The malignance recognition by pathological study not always is easy; in this sense, it requires an exhaustive sampling of the lesion, being specially carefully in some aspects related with malignant transformation such as extending beyond the capsula and involving peripheral tissues. A thyroidal differentiation must be confirmed by immunohistochemical study and other local processes with similar histology should be ruled out. Given the exceptional character of malignant forms, there does not appear to be unanimous agreement on a standard therapy with a somewhat uncertain prognosis."

CD009786,0,21503633,0,Role of minimally invasive surgery in staging of ovarian cancer.,"Since the introduction of laparoscopy and robotic surgery in gynecologic practice in the last several decades, use of these minimally invasive surgical techniques has increased dramatically. The role of minimally invasive surgical techniques continues to expand because they offer reduced intraoperative and postoperative complications, less intraoperative blood loss, and a shorter postoperative recovery. Despite initial concerns about the use of minimally invasive surgery in gynecologic oncology, this approach has been shown to be safe and effective in the management of uterine and cervical cancer, and minimally invasive surgical management of these malignancies is now commonplace. Concerns remain regarding the use of minimally invasive surgery for the staging and management of ovarian cancer, including concerns regarding the adequacy of abdominal exploration and staging with minimally invasive approaches compared to traditional laparotomy and the risks and implications of intra-operative tumor cyst rupture and port-site metastases. However, several case series, retrospective reviews, and case-control studies have demonstrated that minimally invasive surgery is both safe and effective for the staging of borderline ovarian tumors and early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer when performed by a trained gynecologic oncologist. Data to support the role of minimally invasive surgery for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer are scant and use of minimally invasive surgery in this setting is not recommended."

We reviewed our experience with a prospective ongoing protocol for the treatment of benign ovarian teratomas, between January 1990 and December 1996. Sonography established the diagnosis, and biochemical markers were used to screen for possible malignancy. Surgery consisted of resecting the cyst and conserving the ovary if appropriate. The resected cyst was aspirated of its contents following insertion into an EndoCatch bag. Removal was accomplished via the narrowest incision possible by pulling the bag's margins through the incision and grasping the solid parts with conventional surgical instruments. The diameter of the cysts ranged from 2 to 15 cm. Cystectomy was performed in 47, and oophorectomy in 37, patients. Spillage occurred in 11 cases, but none developed peritonitis or fever. The mean duration of post-operative stay was 0.9 days (range 0.5-2). We conclude that laparoscopic resection of benign teratomas of the ovary is safe, well tolerated, and shortens hospital stay."

Endosurgical techniques of biopsy and excision were used for diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors, respectively. Since July 1997, a total of 24 biopsies and 24 excisions have been performed laparoscopically for neuroblastoma ( n=24), ovarian solid tumors ( n=10) and other tumors. Seventeen biopsies and six excisions were performed for abdominal neuroblastoma, while ten excisions were performed for ovarian tumor. In these patients, the length of the operation, blood loss, time to start postoperative feeding, time to start postoperative chemotherapy and length of hospital stay were evaluated and compared to the those of the open surgery group. Furthermore, intra- and postoperative complications were analyzed in all patients of both groups. The length of the hospital stay and time to start postoperative feeding were significantly shorter in the group of patients who underwent endosurgical procedures for either abdominal neuroblastoma or ovarian tumor when compared to the open procedure group. The time to start postoperative chemotherapy was shorter only in the abdominal neuroblastoma group. The procedure for two patients undergoing endosurgical tumor excision had to be converted to open surgery due to large tumor size. Two weeks after thoracoscopic excision of a dumb bell-type neurofibroma, one patient underwent open repair of the dura mater because of leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. There were no port-site recurrences in any tumor types. Endosurgical procedures for solid tumors are effective and minimally invasive. However, better indicators are needed for their implementation in order to prevent complications and subsequent conversions to open procedures."

CD009786,0,17185953,0,[Management of ovarian cysts].,"Ovarian cysts occur frequently in women of reproductive age. These are usually functional cysts which resolve spontaneously and whose evolution can be followed with ultrasound. Non-functional cysts have diverse histologic origins. The most common are serous and mucinous cystadenomas which arise from the epithelial wall of the ovary, endometriomas which arise in the setting of pelvic endometriosis, and dermoid cysts which arise from the germinal cells of the ovary. Endovaginal ultrasound with Doppler enhancement is the best imaging technique to establish the nature of cysts and to distinguish cysts suspicious for malignancy which require more invasive investigation. Pelvic laparoscopy is the surgical approach of choice for the treatment of non-functional benign ovarian cysts. Conservative treatment to shell out the cyst and preserve functional ovarian tissue should be reserved for women desirous of future pregnancies. The risk of ovarian cancer remains a major preoccupation of the surgeon. Where malignancy is suspected, laparoscopy is contraindicated and a median laparotomy is appropriate for radical extirpative surgery. This article describes the diagnostic techniques which allow a laparoscopic approach to presumably benign cysts and discusses surgical techniques specifically adapted to their different histologic nature of ovarian cysts."
CD009786,0,8816863,0,The current role of laparoscopic surgery in gynecological oncology.,"Transabdominal laparotomy is currently the standard approach to the surgical diagnosis and treatment of gynecological malignancies. Despite the fact that laparoscopy has been widely embraced by our gynecological/infertility colleagues for many years, it has only sporadically been utilized by gynecological oncologists. With the advent of video laparoscopy, novel instrumentation, and new techniques, a reevaluation of the applicability of this procedure is certainly in order. To date, laparoscopy has been employed for the performance of a multitude of intra-abdominal procedures. However, universal applicability may not be feasible or in the best interest of all patients with gynecological malignancies. As instrumentation and techniques evolve, it is possible that procedures currently nonamenable to the laparoscopic approach may become so. However, it is wise to approach these new procedures with healthy skepticism, and within the context of proper scientific study.

CD009786,0,19527374,0,Third S. S. Ratnam memorial lecture 2007. Ovarian cancer: Is there hope for women?,"Ovarian cancer is today the most lethal female cancer with an overall survival of only 49.9%. The currently available screening modalities are disappointing in detecting highly curable early stage ovarian cancer. Natural history of ovarian cancer is unknown; it appears it can develop quickly from normal looking ovaries. Timely referral of women with non-specific symptoms (such as abdominal bloating, pelvic pain) for an ultrasound scan or blood CA125 assessments may help in the early diagnosis. Patients with Stage IA or IB disease with grade 1 tumors have a cure rate of >90%; this is likely to be compromised by laparoscopic surgery. In selected patients fertility preservation with good obstetric outcome is possible. However, the relapse rate in 'high risk' early stage ovarian cancers is 40-45%; adjuvant chemotherapy is needed. Only 20-25% of those with stage III and IV disease are cured. Despite a high primary response (70%) majority (70-75%) will relapse and all are likely to succumb. Optimal debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy are needed for stages III and IV disease; the outcome is superior if managed by gynecologic oncologists. Where cost of drugs is an important consideration, an alternative is carboplatin (an affordable and equally effective drug). The role of vaccines needs further study. When relapses occur palliation will be the aim in most instances. Oral contraceptives, breast feeding, tubal sterilization and hysterectomy also have a protective effect. Risk-reducing salpingo-oopherectomy has been suggested in women with BRCA mutations."
CD009786,0,11128910,0,Managing mature cystic teratomas of the ovary.,"Mature cystic teratomas (MCT), commonly called dermoid cysts, are the most common benign germ cell tumors of the ovary in women of reproductive age. Future fertility is of major concern among these women; therefore, the surgical management must focus on preserving ovarian tissue and minimizing adhesion formation. Patients requiring surgery should be appropriately counseled about the risks and benefits of laparoscopy and laparotomy, the risks of intraoperative MCT spillage and adhesion formation. In addition, the risks of recurrence and malignant transformation should be discussed. The parents of children with MCTs have the same concerns as older women and a similar discussion should take place. The goal of this article is to review these issues and provide the physician with the information to counsel their patients preoperatively."

A 31-year-old woman presented with back pain, and radiographic studies disclosed massive liver enlargement and bilateral ovarian tumors. The second patient, a 38-year-old woman, had an enlarged liver at the time of laparoscopic tubal ligation, and subsequently underwent right hepatic lobectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Three months later a left ovarian tumor was detected and a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy performed. The third patient, a 68-year-old woman, presented with gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss, and had bilateral ovarian tumors and widespread tumor at laparotomy. Two patients died of their disease at 18 months and 4 years 7 months; the third patient is alive with residual tumor at 7 months. The ovarian tumors, which were bilateral and multinodular in two cases and focally cystic in one case, ranged from 4 to 11 cm in maximum dimension, and had yellow-green or yellow sectioned surfaces. On microscopic examination, they were composed of cells with moderate to abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm growing diffusely and in nodules, nests, and trabeculae; cysts or glands were conspicuous in two cases. Bile was present in one tumor. The main differential diagnostic considerations were hepatoid yolk sac tumor and hepatoid carcinoma, primary or metastatic in the ovary. A variety of features, including the age of the patient, unilaterality or bilaterality of the ovarian tumors, distribution of disease, and microscopic features of the neoplasm, including the identification of bile, established the diagnosis. Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma must be included in the differential diagnosis of oxyphil cell tumors of the ovary."

CD009786,0,21082898,0,An easy new approach to the laparoscopic treatment of large adnexal cysts.,"We describe a technique for laparoscopically assisted extracorporeal cystectomy or adnexectomy of large adnexal cysts without spillage of the cyst contents. At open laparoscopy, a suction tube decompressed the adnexal cyst from the 2-cm umbilical incision and the puncture hole was closed by the purse string tie, which was followed by extra-corporeal excision of the cyst. With this method, we prevent cyst spillage in three ways. Firstly, the cyst is aspirated extracorporeally. Secondly, when the cyst is totally collapsed, the puncture point is closed with a 1-o Vicryl purse suture and pulled to the umbilicus. Thirdly, as soon as a part of the mass is delivered from the abdomen, it is lined with moist gauze. This method provides excellent visualization and control of the penetration site during aspiration, and minimizes the chances of the cyst contents leaking into the peritoneal cavity. This method was successfully used with 12 patients, including four cystadenomas, one serous cystadenoma, three dermoid cysts (with one pregnant woman who successfully spontaneously delivered a normal baby at term), two low malignant potential ovarian tumors and one grade I endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The cancer patient has shown no recurrence after a follow-up of three years."

Prior to treatment, peritoneoscopy documented new sites of involvement undetected by conventional radiologic and isotopic procedures in 42 patients (48%) and provided the only evidence for follow-up of disease in 25 patients (28%). Twenty-one percent of patients referred with Stages I and II disease were upstaged to Stage III on the basis of diaphragmatic disease detected at peritoneoscopy. In the 66 restaging (posttreatment) peritoneoscopies, residual disease was found in 33 (50%) and peritoneoscopic findings provided the only evidence for disease in 24 cases (36%). These patients were spared an unnecessary second-look laparotomy. Twenty-two patients with negative peritoneoscopies underwent laparotomy. Residual ovarian cancer was found in 12 (55%), mainly in the pelvis and mesentery. Thus, a negative peritoneoscopy must be followed by a laparotomy before a patient with ovarian cancer can be considered disease free. Peritoneoscopy was found to be a safe and feasible procedure, even in patients who had prior laparotomies. It could not be performed for technical reasons in only 6% of the patients.

CD009786,0,16575358,0,[Laparoscopy and gynecologic cancer in 2005].,"All the surgical procedures, which may be required to treat a gynecologic cancer, can be performed endoscopically. However prospective randomized studies required to confirm the oncologic efficacy of the technique are still lacking in gynecology, whereas such studies are available in digestive surgery. Animal studies suggested that the risk of tumor dissemination in non traumatized peritoneum is higher after a pneumoperitoneum than after a laparotomy. Experimental studies also emphasized two points: the surgeon and the surgical technique are essential, all the parameters of the pneumoperitoneum may influence the postoperative dissemination. Changing these parameters we may, in the future, be able to create a peritoneal environment adapted to oncologic patients in order to prevent or to decrease the risks of peritoneal dissemination and/or of postoperative tumor growth. Until the results of prospective randomized studies become available, the preoperative selection of the patients and the surgical technique should be very strict. In patients with endometrial cancer, the laparoscopic approach should be reserved to clinical stage I disease, if the vaginal extraction is anticipated to be easy accounting for the volume of the uterus and the local conditions. In cervical cancer, the laparoscopic approach should be reserved to patients with favorable prognostic factors: stage IB of less than 2 cm in diameter. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the surgical diagnosis of adnexal masses. But the puncture should be avoided whenever possible. The surgical treatment of invasive ovarian cancer should be performed by laparotomy whatever the stage. In contrast restaging of an early ovarian cancer initially managed as a benign mass, is a good indication of the laparoscopic approach. The laparoscopic management of low malignant potential tumors should include a complete staging of the peritoneum. Knowledge of the principles of endoscopy and of oncologic surgery is required. Teaching and diffusion of endoscopic oncological techniques are among the major challenges of gynecologic surgery within the next few years."

At laparoscopy, a smooth surfaced, firm and mobile right adnexal mass with solid and cystic portions was detected and the tumor was excised. Pathologic and immunohistochemical examination revealed carcinoid tumor. After the evaluation of gastrointestinal and respiratory systems by imaging and endoscopic studies, no evidence of tumor tissue or metastases were found. Based on this finding, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and appendectomy were performed and pelvic-paraaortic lymph nodes were also removed. All histological findings were similar to the features of mature cystic teratoma and carcinoid tumor. Examination of the resected lymphatic, omental and appendiceal tissue indicated no tumoral invasion. Thus, the diagnosis was primary ovarian carcinoid arising from a mature cystic teratoma. This case, in the setting of a normal appendix and negative workup for an extraovarian origin, is one of a primary ovarian adenocarcinoid tumor. The primary carcinoid tumor should be differentiated from a metastatic carcinoid inside the ovary, which is always bilateral.

Case-control study].,"A clustering of radiologic signs is associated with the presence of ovarian and/or peritoneal endometriosis: some indicate fibrosis of utero-sacral ligaments (isthmic dissection of the uterus, fixed retroversion); others are linked to pathology of the tube (ampullar retention of dye after evacuation, sometimes inducing false aspects of hydrosalpinx); the last ones suggesting peritoneal adhesions (incomplete peritoneal diffusion). All these signs have been systematically studied, independently of the diagnosis, on 154 hysterosalpingograms of infertile patients known to have patent tubes at laparoscopy: in 107 out of these cases endometriosis was diagnosed at laparoscopy; the 47 last cases constituted the control group. The results confirm that all the signs described are significantly more frequent in cases of endometriosis, although non-specific for this condition. On the contrary, neither adenomyosis, tubal diverticulosis, nor intramural polyps are significantly linked to external endometriosis. In conclusion, some radiologic signs suggest the presence of peritoneo-ovarian endometriosis. Their detection is possible only on high quality pictures, including a last one taken after 10 to 20 minutes walking, to feature the anomalies of tubal evacuation and peritoneal diffusion. The clustering of these signs allows the clinician to propose an early laparoscopy in the work-up of an infertility case. Furthermore, some of these salpingograms provide evidence of a functional disorder of tubal motility in endometriosis, possibly responsible for the low fertility associated with the disease."
CD009786,0,16455020,0,Transperitoneal laparoscopic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in gynecologic cancers.,"Laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgery, may benefit select patients more than traditional abdominal approaches. The benefits of this procedure include low morbidity, shorter length of hospital stay, less blood loss, no significant increase in complications, and a shorter postoperative recovery period; this allows patients to begin adjuvant therapy more quickly. Laparoscopy has been used in gynecologic oncology since the early 1990s and has continued to grow and develop. Complex gynecologic oncology procedures can be performed with a low rate of complication and a low rate of conversion to laparotomy. The literature supports the fact that laparoscopy can be performed with short-term benefit with no increase in morbidity. Although the data are limited and emerging, the risk of cancer recurrence does not appear to increase because of this minimal access approach. Currently, advanced laparoscopic techniques are used to evaluate and treat cervical, endometrial, and ovarian malignancies. Specifically, transperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy including pelvic and paraaortic nodes is a feasible and efficacious procedure in the management of certain gynecologic malignancies."
CD009786,0,9280737,0,[Treatment of adnexal tumors with laparoscopy].,"This article shows the experience in 61 patients with adnexal tumors studied from June 1988 to June 1994; the origin of the patients in private and semiprivate, to whom we practiced a diagnostic and operative laparoscopy (56/61) at the same time. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined by clinical history (past history, age, symptoms, size, etc.), vaginal ultrasonography scan (ascites, papillas, cyst's content, etc.), laboratory tests (Ca 125 in postmenopausal patients), the macroscopic assessment during the diagnostic laparoscopy, transoperative biopsy (19/61) was made in order to confirm the benign findings seen before laparoscopy; and the results were accordingly on the 61 cases. The cause of consult was infertility in 24/61; 18/61 were primary infertility; 6/61 were secondary infertility. We did 22 cystectomies and 2 oophorectomies; 10 of them became pregnant. 37 from 61 had pain, nine of this group we did an oophorectomy (2 by torsion, 3 had hemorrhagic cysts that were ruptured and 4 were residual ovary), the rest 28 we performed cystectomy with frank improvement of their symptoms. The postoperative diagnosis of the tumors were: luteomas 13/61; functional cysts 17/61, Hemorrhagic cysts 8/61; endometriomas 9/61; serous cystoadenoma 3/61; mucinous cystoadenoma 1/61; ovaric fibroma 1/61; mature cystic teratoma 2/61; residual ovaries 4/61; paraovaric cysts 2/61 and Morgagni's hydatide 1/61.

One hundred patients with endometriosis, as demonstrated by laparoscopy, were entered into the study. The mean length of patient follow-up was 49 months. All patients were treated with 800 mg of danazol per day. The mean duration of danazol therapy was 17.3 weeks. Eighty-nine percent of the patients reported symptomatic improvement, and 94% were improved, as demonstrated by repeat laparoscopy or laparatomy. After completing a course of danazol therapy, 57% of the patients underwent conservative laparotomy for fertility enhancement, pain control, or ovarian masses. Two patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy-bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for advanced disease poorly responsive to danazol therapy. In those patients desiring fertility (56), there were 38 pregnancies in 26 women, for an overall fertility rate of 46%. The overall recurrence rate was 33%, as determined by symptoms and physical findings. Significant side effects from danazol were reported by 85% of the patients. The major side effects were weight gain, edema, decrease in breast size, oily skin, hirsutism, and deepening of the voice. Only one patient discontinued danazol therapy due to side effects. Clinical tissues concerning the use of danazol with or without surgery and the miscarriage rate following danazol therapy are discussed."

This study is a systematic review. We searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and COCHRANE LIBRARY) trials registers and reference lists of published trial reports. Six randomized controlled trials were identified involving 324 patients. Duration of surgery, adverse effects of surgery, pain, length of hospital stay, and economic outcomes were compared. The mean duration of surgery was longer in the laparoscopy group overall (weighted mean difference 11.39, 95% CI 0.57-22.22). The pooled estimate for febrile morbidity decreased for laparoscopy (Peto OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.88). The odds of any adverse effect were decreased after laparoscopic procedures (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.55). The odds of being pain free were significantly greater for the laparoscopy group (Peto OR 7.35, 95% CI 4.3-12.56). Mean length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopy group with reduction of 2.79 days (95% CI -2.95 to -2.62). In economic outcomes, there was a significant reduction of US$1045 (95% CI -1361 to -726.97) in the laparoscopy group. Laparoscopy is associated with a reduction in the following: febrile morbidity, urinary tract infection, postoperative complications, postoperative pain, days in hospital, and total cost. These findings should be interpreted with caution as only a small number of studies were identified including a total of only 324 women."
CD009786,0,9315174,0,Evaluation of adnexal masses using three-dimensional ultrasonographic technology: preliminary report.,"The purpose of the current study was to demonstrate the ability of three-dimensional ultrasonographic technology to enhance the morphologic scoring system and further improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant ovarian masses. We performed conventional two-dimensional and three-dimensional transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography on eight women with adnexal masses. All patients underwent exploratory laparotomy or diagnostic laparoscopy. The three-dimensional ultrasonographic findings were compared with the two-dimensional ultrasonograms, the intraoperative observations, and gross and histopathologic findings. The morphologic scoring system as described by Sassone and coworkers was adopted, with scores of less than 9 suggestive of benign lesions, and this system was applied in both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasonographic examinations. The morphologic scores were subsequently compared. The images were dissected in the XYZ planes, and the areas suggestive of malignancy, as suggested by two-dimensional ultrasonography, were determined to be either negative or positive and confirmatory. In each of the eight adnexal masses, three-dimensional ultrasonography confirmed the preoperative diagnoses. The morphologic scores did not differ between two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasonograms for the benign cysts. In one case of benign solid fibroma, both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional gray scale morphologic scores were falsely positive at greater than 9. In one case of malignant serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma the two-dimensional morphologic score was a 9, where- as the three-dimensional score was 13. This difference in scores can be attributed to the additional views available with three-dimensional volume scanning, which allowed better characterization of the pathologic conditions. In addition, three-dimensional sonographic technology had the added advantage of high-speed image acquisition and recording to decrease the time of scanning to improve patient comfort. Furthermore, three-dimensional ultrasonography allowed the real-time analysis of the acquired image data to be conducted at a later time when the patient is off the examination table. Our preliminary results suggest that three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonographic technology can enhance and facilitate the morphologic evaluation of both benign and malignant adnexal masses."

Only one microscopically involved lymph node was lost at laparoscopic lymphadenectomy when a laparotomic control followed immediately after. It seems bleeding, which is the most serious perioperative complication, is more common during laparoscopic lymphadenectomy than during laparotomy; however, the incidence will decrease with experience of the surgeon. The laparoscopic procedure does not seem to influence negatively the survival of patients with early stage endometrial and cervical cancer.

CD009786,0,6715399,0,Diagnosis and staging of ovarian cancer.,"The diagnostic process in ovarian carcinoma is divided into the pre- and intraoperative procedures, examinations of tumor tissue, and follow-up. For preoperative diagnosis, the probability of a palpable adnexal mass being a malignant tumor should first be ascertained by sonography. This should be followed by an appropriate general examination, a search for tumor outside the abdominal cavity and in the liver parenchyma as well as by determination of markers. Intraoperative diagnosis determines the tumor stage and must be carried out all the more comprehensively when the ovarian carcinoma is more limited. Histologic subtype and degree of differentiation are in direct relation to the tumor stage, whereas the size of the primary tumor is often indirectly proportional to its extent. Besides the morphological analysis, the determination of possible chemoresistance and chemosensitivity, as well as further investigations on fresh tumor tissue are included in the tissue examination. Follow-up after a curative operation consists of gynecologic examination and Douglas lavages if tumor is still present in CT Scans and sonographs. To verify a relapse, laparoscopy can be used, but to ascertain a complete remission, a laparotomy is necessary."

CD009786,0,19346186,0,The roles of laparoscopy in treating ovarian cancer.,"Great advances in technology offer meticulous options of minimally invasive surgery to empower the gynecologists to manage patients of early ovarian cancer. Laparoscopy affords improved visualization of the pelvic peritoneum, diaphragm and the deep pelvic structures, and offers many advantages in the avoidance of long abdominal incision, including shorter hospital stay and a more rapid recovery time. Most studies showed that laparoscopy did not compromise the survival and recurrence prognosis in comparison with open abdominal approach of staging surgery. Contrarily, laparoscopy precludes the advantage of open surgery, such as manual examination of the full extent of the bowel and palpation of lymph nodes. Besides, laparoscopy technically hampers the removal of large ovarian mass, and laparoscopic cancer surgery has a potential risk of trocar site metastasis. As the trend shows that laparoscopy has been playing an important role in treating early ovarian cancer, we could expect laparoscopy to become an attractive surgical option in the future for ovarian cancers."

In contrast the inadequate surgical management of an undiagnosed ovarian cancer may worsen the prognosis. The diagnosis is the key step. To be able to immediately and completely treat an ovarian cancer when managing an ovarian tumor surgically, Laparoscopic diagnosis is safe and reliable when used cautiously. The surgical diagnosis may and should probably be performed by laparoscopy whatever the ultrasonographic appearance of the tumor. Masses diagnosed as suspicious at surgery should be treated by immediate laparotomy, since the results of laparoscopic treatment of an ovarian cancer are not known. In young patients, conservative surgery is the main advantage of laparoscopy, and should be achieved in most benign masses. The recent progresses of in vitro fertilization should be taken into account when managing an ovarian tumor in a patient who wishes to become pregnant. Frozen sections are useful, when treating highly suspicious masses, allowing an immediate staging and avoiding the disadvantages of a second surgical procedure. Whenever a malignant tumor has been missed at laparoscopy, restaging is required and should be considered to be an oncologic emergency."

Specialized magnetic graspers are introduced through a standard 12-mm port and are controlled by a powerful external magnet. This study is a retrospective analysis of all magnet-assisted laparoscopic operations performed at the Fundacion Hospitalaria Private Children's Hospital from September 2009 to January 2011. Outcomes include demographics, diagnosis, operative time, intraoperative complications, and conversion rates. Forty-four magnet-assisted laparoscopic operations were performed. The operations included 23 appendectomies, 8 cholecystectomies, 3 Nissen fundoplications, 2 gastrojejunostomies, 2 splenectomies, 2 ovarian tumor/cyst resections, 1 retroperitoneal lymphangioma resection, 1 left adrenalectomy, 1 total abdominal colectomy and 1 pulmonary wedge resection. The mean operative times for the most commonly performed operations were 61 minutes for appendectomy and 93 minutes for cholecystectomy. The operations were classified as follows: Group I, adjunct to conventional laparoscopy (5 operations); Group II, adjunct to multiple-access umbilical laparoscopy (11 operations); and Group III, true single-port laparoscopy (28 operations). Among Group II/III operations, 6 operations required 1 additional port outside the umbilicus. No operations required more that 1 additional port, and no operations were converted to the open technique. There were no intraoperative complications. Magnet-assisted laparoscopic surgery is safe and effective in children. The use of magnetic graspers improves triangulation and ergonomics while reducing the number and size of abdominal incisions."

CD009786,0,12680799,0,Blood-based screening and light based imaging for the early detection and monitoring of ovarian cancer xenografts.,"We report a novel technology for in vivo early detection, identification, and monitoring of ovarian cancer in live mice leading to better treatment outcome. A genetic dualistic reporter system that uses an adenoviral (Ad) vector to transfer the genetic reporters to the ovarian cancer is described. Infection of the cancer cells leads to expression of one reporter that is detected in blood, namely, secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). A second reporter, namely, enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) is also delivered by the Ad, leading to expression at the site of ovarian cancer. The SEAP gene under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter element is linked to the GFP gene with an IRES element. A diagnostic adenoviral vector (Ad) encoding the SEAP and GFP (Ad5-SEAP-GFP) is produced. Efficacy of newly developed diagnostic vector is tested in cell culture and animal models. SKOV3ip.1 cells are infected with Ad5-SEAP-GFP. Over time the cells are monitored for fluorescence and SEAP is also measured in the growth media supernatant. For animal experiments, SKOV3ip.1 cells are implanted first in nude mice either subcutaneously (SC) or intraperitoneally (IP) separately. After 4-7 days, the Ad5-SEAP-GFP is administered. Control mice do not receive any Ad vector. All mice are imaged with a fluorescent stereomicroscope after 24 h, and blood is collected for SEAP analyses. Increasing green fluorescence is detected in all SKOV3ip.1 cells infected with Ad5-SEAP-GFP, while SEAP levels in growth media increase over monitoring period. Expression of GFP in both SC and IP tumors is detected by 24 h in the live mice. At this time, the SEAP blood levels are more than 2-3 fold greater than blood levels of control group. GFP fluorescence and SEAP levels continue to increase in all mice that are injected with Ad5-SEAP-GFP until termination. Control mice (both SC and IP) do not express GFP or SEAP throughout the experiment. GFP contrast is necessary to differentiate between micro-sized early stage non-palpable ovarian tumor nodules and surrounding normal tissue. While the studies are conducted in mice, it is envisioned that the dual-based approach will eventually be translated into human applications for routine diagnosis and monitoring of ovarian cancer when an ovarian cancer specific promoter will be available. Due to the thickness of the abdominal wall in human laparoscopy or laparotomy will be necessary. This system will provide gynecologic oncologists with a more effective tool for treating patients. The blood-based screening assay provides a quick test to determine the presence of the ovarian cancer at its earliest stage. The location of the ovarian cancer is afforded by the light-based imaging component, which represents a new and improving technology with tremendous advantages of sensitivity and spatial resolution to localize micro-sized tumor nodules. The novelty of the dualistic system is the linkage of blood-based reporter screening as a selection criteria for subsequent light-based imaging procedures. This combination will lead to an accurate and widely applicable method for the early detection and monitoring of ovarian cancer, especially in high-risk women"

Laparoscopic hysterectomy can be taken into consideration at the first stage of endometrial, cervical and ovarian cancer. If there is doubt about an uterus sarcoma and a laparoscopic access is accomplished, a conversion to abdominal hysterectomy must be done. Obesity and big uteri are not a contrarindication for that minimally-invasive access. Today, laparoscopic hysterectomy is a reasonable alternative to total abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy."

These patients responded to chemotherapy, but there were three recurrences noted that responded to further therapy. Seventy-four per cent of the benign tumors were teratomas. The most common presentation was abdominal pain in 27 patients (55%) followed by an abdominal mass. Ultrasound and CT scans were the most common imaging studies with a mean mass size of 14.7 cm. A majority of the patients underwent a laparotomy with 12 per cent having a minimally invasive procedure. Only 37 per cent of the operations were performed by the pediatric surgeons. There were no deaths in this series after a follow up of over 6 years. Most ovarian masses in childhood are benign. Malignant lesions have favorable outcomes with chemotherapy, even with recurrent disease. Consideration for laparoscopic procedures should be given for the benign lesions."

A prospective observational study of EOC patients with pelvic/aortic lymph node relapse was conducted between January 1995 and June 2005. After a clinical and laparoscopic staging, secondary cytoreduction, including systematic lymphadenectomy, were performed. The eligibility criteria were as follows: disease-free interval > or =6 months, radiographic finding suggestive of bulky lymph node recurrence, and patients' consent to be treated with chemotherapy. Forty-eight EOC patients with lymph node relapse were recruited. Twenty-nine patients were amenable to cytoreductive surgery. Postoperatively, all patients received adjuvant treatment. The median numbers of resected aortic and pelvic nodes were 15 (2-32) and 17 (8-47), respectively. The median numbers of resected aortic and pelvic positive lymph nodes were 4 (1-18) and 3 (1-17), respectively. The mean size of bulky nodes was 3.3 cm. Four patients (14%) experienced one severe complication. No treatment-related deaths were observed. After a median follow-up of 26 months, among cytoreduced patients, 18 women were alive with no evidence of disease, nine were alive with disease. Among the 11 patients not amenable to surgery, five women were alive with persistent disease, six patients died of disease, at a median follow-up of 18 months. Estimated 5-year overall survival and disease-free interval for operated women were 87% and 31%, respectively. In conclusion, patients with bulky lymph node relapse can benefit from systematic lymphadenectomy in terms of survival. The procedure is feasible with an acceptable morbidity rate."

Typically, lymphangiomas are slow-growing tumors that remain asymptomatic for a long time. They are most often found incidentally in abdominal or pelvic imaging studies or at surgery or autopsy. Wide excision of the lesion with microscopically clear margins is the best approach when feasible. A postmenopausal woman had a symptomatic pelvic mass. Imaging studies demonstrated a complex left ovarian cyst. Complete removal of a cystic lymphangioma was successfully performed at laparoscopy.

CD009786,0,1838204,0,[Echographic guided puncture of ovarian cysts. Possibilities and limitations].,"Ultrasound-guided puncture is a simple and easy to perform procedure. It would seem to be a good idea to suggest simple puncture as a first intention in cases of an image of ovarian cyst. In theory, the advantages are obvious: a puncture is performed, the liquid is analyzed and an appropriate treatment is administered. Coelio-surgery could surely be avoided in cases of functional cysts and perhaps in some non-malignant ovarian cysts. In fact, it must be remembered that a cancer of the ovary in its early stages may have the appearance of a banal cyst, and that puncture does not allow pathological examination. Cytological examination is insufficient to totally rule out malignancy or to allow detailed histological diagnosis. There is, therefore, a risk of leaving in place the pocket of a cyst which may be organic and which may recur or even develop. For these reasons, ultrasound-guided puncture can be undertaken only in pre-selected patients and in the context of a specific protocol: 1) The ultrasound image of the cyst must be liquid, anechoic, unilocular (or bilocular with a fin wall), with no vegetation, the serum level of CA 125 must be low; 2) it the puncture liquid is oily, tarry or viscous, a celioscopy must be carried out as soon as possible, only a yellow-colored liquid can justify waiting; 3) the analysis of the cyst fluid is not always determinant, and the cytology findings are conclusive only if positive. A high 17 beta-estradiol level suggests a functional cyst.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Abdominal radiation included the entire peritoneal cavity and both diaphragms; the liver was not shielded. Only 2 patients had residual disease greater than 2 cm. No group 1 patients underwent pretherapy restaging laparoscopy prior to radiation or second look laparotomy after treatment. Eighty percent of group 2 patients underwent restaging laparoscopy (10) or staging laparotomy (2) prior to radiation. All group 2 patients underwent second look procedures if no evidence of disease. No patient developed intestinal complications secondary to radiation requiring surgery. Eighty-one percent of group 1 patients and to date 40% of group 2 patients developed recurrences. Size of residual disease prior to radiation, histologic grade, and substage (IIA, B, or C) did not correlate with recurrences. Five-year estimated survival was 40 and 50% for groups 1 and 2, respectively. Three thousand rad of wole abdominal radiation plus 2000 rad pelvic boost or 5000 rad pelvic radiation plus melphalan did not appear to improve survival over surgery alone.

CD009786,0,19896593,0,Robotics and gynecologic oncology: review of the literature.,"The objectives of this article were to review the published scientific literature about robotics and its application to gynecologic oncology to date and to summarize findings of this advanced computerenhanced laparoscopic technique. Relevant sources were identified by a search of PUBMED from January 1950 to January 2009 using the key words Robot or Robotics and Cervical cancer, Endometrial cancer, Gynecologic oncology, and Ovarian cancer. Appropriate case reports, case series, retrospective studies, prospective trials, and review articles were selected. A total of 38 articles were identified on the subject, and 27 were included in the study. The data for gynecologic cancer show comparable results between robotic and laparoscopic surgery for estimated blood loss, operative time, length of hospital stay, and complications. Overall, there were more wound complications with the laparotomy approach compared with laparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopy. There were more lymphocysts, lymphoceles, and lymphedema in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group compared with the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups in patients with cervical cancer. Infectious and lung-related morbidity, postoperative ileus, and bleeding or clot formation were more commonly reported in the laparotomy group compared with the other 2 cohorts in patients with endometrial cancer. Computer-enhanced technology may enable more surgeons to convert laparotomies to laparoscopic surgery with its associated benefits. It seems that in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons, final outcomes are the same with or without use of the robot. There is good evidence that robotic surgery facilitates laparoscopic surgery, with equivalent if not better operative time and comparable surgical outcomes, shorter hospital stay, and fewer major complications than with surgeries using the laparotomy approach."

CD009786,0,8163617,0,[Voluminous ovarian cyst in children. Therapeutic strategy].,"Ovarian cysts are rare in children but can sometimes become extremely large, leading to difficult therapeutic decisions. There is general agreement that the therapeutic attitude for benign serous cysts less than 5 cm in diameter includes echographic monitoring and possible echo-guided punction. For cysts larger than 5 cm, most authors favour cystectomy via the celioscopic route using either celio-surgery or mini-laparotomy. On the contrary, the clinical manifestations of large cysts greater than 15 cm in diameter may vary greatly, presenting as increased abdominal volume, pain, respiratory impairment. The large size of the cyst should not be allowed to mask an associated torsion of the annexes in cases of paroxysmal abdominal pain. We report our experience of 6 voluminous ovarian cysts with a largest diameter varying between 15 and 40 cm. The children's age varied from 10 to 15 years. There were 3 dermoid cysts, 2 treated by ovariectomy and 1 by celio-surgery, 1 torsion of the annexes on dermoid cyst was treated via laparotomy. There were two cases of mucinous cystadenomas, 1 treated by mini-laparatomy and the other by celio-surgery. Finally one serous cyst with torsion of the annex was treated by annexectomy. The large size of the cysts may impair the surgical approach. Prudent ceilo-surgery should be preferred to wide laparotomy. Introduction should be performed under visual control followed by leak-free punction. The cyst is emptied before exeresis of the ovary via a mini-laparotomy since, in many of these cases of voluminous tumours, cystectomy cannot always be performed and ovariectomy must be preferred."

CD009786,0,19852568,0,Seven years' experience in laparoscopic dissection of intact ovarian dermoid cysts.,"A large case series on laparoscopic removal of dermoid cysts with a diameter between 3 and 12 cm, via an endobag, is reported (127 cysts in 121 premenopausal women). The incidence of spillage and recurrence rate of laparoscopic ovarian dermoid cystectomy, the duration of the surgical procedure, the length of hospitalization, the incidence of recurrence and pregnancies was evaluated. In 2.5% of cases, the endobag ruptured during removal, and a total spillage rate of 12% was seen. No signs or symptoms of peritonitis were observed regardless of cystic spillage or not. Laparoscopic cystectomy of dermoid cysts in premenopausal women is safe and effective and appears to be a valuable alternative to laparotomy. Controlled intraperitoneal spillage of cyst contents does not increase postoperative morbidity as long as an endobag is used and the peritoneal cavity is washed out thoroughly."
CD009786,0,11176227,0,Risk of spread of ovarian cancer after laparoscopic surgery.,"The incidence of the spread of ovarian cancer after laparoscopic surgery is difficult to establish from the current literature. The prognosis incidence of a trocar site metastasis without peritoneal dissemination is not known. Data from general surgeons in prospective studies from a single institution suggested that in colon cancer the risk is low, whereas it seems to be much higher in multicentric studies of undiagnosed gallbladder cancer. Experimental studies suggested that laparoscopy has advantages and disadvantages. However, the risk of dissemination is high when a large number of malignant cells and a carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum are present, a situation encountered when managing adnexal tumours with large vegetations. Animal studies will allow the development of a peritoneal environment adapted to the treatment of cancer. The ovary is an intraperitoneal organ and ovarian cancer a peritoneal disease, so the risk of peritoneal spread may be higher in ovarian cancer than in other gynecological cancers. A careful preoperative evaluation appears to be the best way to prevent these risks. It should also be used to choose which patient should be operated by which surgical team. The second step is a careful and cautious laparoscopic diagnosis, so that more than 98% of ovarian cancers encountered can be treated immediately and effectively. The laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer remains controversial; it should be performed only in prospective clinical trials. Until the results of such studies become available, an immediate vertical midline laparotomy remains the gold standard if a cancer is encountered."

CD009786,0,8252224,0,Laparoscopic hysterectomy and cancer.,"Laparoscopic hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy is a procedure which is now gaining popularity in the UK. It has been clearly demonstrated that this technique is superior to abdominal hysterectomy and oophorectomy via laparotomy, and often replaces this procedure. In cases where vaginal hysterectomy is likely to prove difficult or impossible in the hands of most surgeons, the laparoscopic route is of value. In those cases where dense pelvic adhesions or poor vaginal access exist, or where oophorectomy is co-indicated, laparoscopic surgery converts operation via laparotomy to a less invasive procedure, with consequent benefits in terms of both patient care and bed occupancy. In the case of malignant disease, laparoscopic hysterectomy and oophorectomy is a viable alternative to open abdominal hysterectomy, but great care must be taken that patients with malignant disease are not under-treated."

No patient had been previously treated with chemotherapy. Peritoneoscopy with diaphragmatic inspection, peritoneal cytology, lymphography, and chest X-ray were routinely used in staging and restaging the patients. Complete (CR) plus partial (PR) responses were obtained in 13/31 fully restaged patients (41.9%). CR was recorded in seven patients (22.5%) and PR in six patients (19.3%). Remission duration was significantly longer in patients who achieved CR (20 months) than in those who attained PR (9.5 months) (P Less Than 0.01). In all treated patients the median duration of survival was 16.5 months. Survival was significantly longer in patients with CR than in patients who did not achieve CR (P Less Than 0.05). Nevertheless, considering the rate of CR in patients with gross disease (20.6%), HEXA-CAF combination seems a useful but not yet a hopeful treatment for patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma."

Salpingoscopy, ovarian cystoscopy and endo-ovarian surgery with the argon laser.","Salpingoscopy gives detailed visual information on the mucosal pattern of the tubal ampulla as far as the isthmoampullary junction. With experience it takes 10 minutes to perform salpingoscopy on both sides and with an additional dye test a most complete evaluation of tubal morphology and patency can be obtained during routine diagnostic laparoscopy. Comparative studies proved the technique to be superior to HSG and the laparoscopic inspection of the tubal serosa and of the fimbriae. In some instances, like a tubocornual block, only salpingoscopy can provide additional information. Eventually, with the current techniques of operative laparoscopy salpingoscopic inspection of a phimosis or even a hydrosalpinx can be performed quite easily and these findings help us in the clinical management of patients requiring either microsurgical cuff-salpingostomy (giving a more realistic chance of a spontaneous pregnancy every month) or in vitro fertilization (avoiding laparotomy). Salpingoscopy also guides us in the selection of patients for a GIFT procedure and probably provides a better estimation of the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian cystoscopy can be applied for accurate diagnosis of non-malignant ovarian cysts at the time of laparoscopy. The wall of the cyst is inspected in detail and selective biopsies are obtained. Unnecessary surgery for non-neoplastic tumours can be avoided and endometrial and cystic tumours can be treated in situ using an argon laser with minimal surgical damage to the ovarian capsule. This laser technique is under further investigation to evaluate its place in the diagnosis and conservative surgical treatment of benign ovarian cysts occurring during reproductive life."

CDE imaging is characterized by an increased sensitivity to flow, and thus may be useful in low-flow states and when optimal Doppler angles cannot be obtained. In addition, longer segments of vessels and more individual vessels can be visualized with CDE imaging. The role of CDE imaging in the evaluation of stromal vasculature in normal and in polycystic ovaries is described, and the relationship between follicular vascularity and outcome following in-vitro fertilization are discussed, together with the findings obtained from the evaluation of thecal arteriole of corpus luteum in early pregnancy. The fundamental role of CDE imaging in differentiation among ovarian masses is also reviewed. We summarize the role of CDE imaging in pregnancy, and describe two new applications of three-dimensional power Doppler sonography and the use of ultrasound contrast media. In conclusion, CDE imaging can replace conventional colour Doppler when the information on the direction of flow is not useful. Moreover, the technique appears superior to others for describing microvascular architecture and determining the presence or absence of flow."
CD009786,0,7855480,0,The role of laparoscopy in the management of gynecologic malignancy.,"With the advent of minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, most gynecologic procedures for benign conditions can be performed in an outpatient setting. However, the role of such techniques in gynecologic oncology is not well defined. By reviewing the literature and presenting some new data, we attempt to elucidate the applications of operative videolaparoscopy in gynecologic oncology. Advanced laparoscopic techniques are utilized for the management of cervical cancer as well as the staging and treatment of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Such techniques are used in performing radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer, pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy, and second look laparoscopy following chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. Even though preliminary data are encouraging, large prospective controlled studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to better define the role and limitations of laparoscopy in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies."

CD009786,0,17145485,0,Health technology assessment of surgical therapies for benign gynaecological disease.,"This chapter summarises the evidence of the benefits and harm of surgical therapies for benign gynaecological disease. We have limited the discussion in this chapter to three gynaecological conditions - menorrhagia, endometriosis and benign ovarian tumours - with a further section on the different surgical approaches for performing a hysterectomy for menorrhagia due to dysfunctional uterine bleeding and pelvic masses such as fibroids and benign adnexal masses. The currently available evidence suggests that there is little to choose between the four first-generation endometrial destruction techniques - laser ablation, transcervical resection of endometrium, vaporisation ablation and rollerball ablation - in terms of clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction. There is a paucity of evidence with regards to the comparison of the different second-generation endometrial-destruction techniques but current evidence suggests that bipolar radiofrequency ablation is more effective than thermal balloon ablation for treating menorrhagia. Overall, the second-generation techniques are at least as effective as first-generation methods but are easier to perform and can be done under local rather than general anaesthesia in some circumstances. Hysteroscopic endometrial ablation is an alternative to hysterectomy and should be offered to women with menorrhagia because of its high satisfaction rates, shorter operation time, shorter hospital stay, earlier recovery and reduced postoperative complications; hysterectomy remains the surgical option of choice for women with intractable menorrhagia despite repeated endometrial ablations and for those who do not wish under any circumstances to continue to have menstrual bleeding. The combined use of laparoscopic laser ablation, adhesiolysis and uterine nerve ablation has been shown to have a beneficial effect on pelvic pain associated with mild to moderate endometriosis. Current evidence also supports the use of laparoscopic treatment of minimal and mild endometriosis to improve the on-going pregnancy and live birth rate in infertile patients. The current available evidence suggests that the laparoscopic approach is superior to laparotomy for the surgical management of benign ovarian cysts. It results in less postoperative pain and a shorter postoperative hospital stay; it also costs less. With regards to the surgical approach for performing a hysterectomy for menorrhagia and benign pelvic masses, vaginal hysterectomy should be performed over laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy when possible. Where it is not possible to perform the hysterectomy vaginally, then laparoscopic hysterectomy can be employed instead of abdominal hysterectomy to avoid a laparotomy scar. There appears to be no significant advantage in performing a subtotal hysterectomy instead of the total removal of the uterine corpus and cervix."
CD009786,0,23142076,0,Is perioperative visual estimation of intra-abdominal tumor spread reliable in ovarian cancer surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy?,"Most cases of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are diagnosed in an advanced stage. When the disease has spread intra-abdominally, complete surgical tumor debulking is the single most important prognostic factor. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) before surgery can cause fibrosis and adhesions in the peritoneal cavity and may interfere with the perioperative evaluation of tumor spread. In this prospective study, we evaluated whether perioperative visual assessment of tumor dissemination is similar in patients undergoing primary and interval surgery for EOC."
CD009786,0,16261563,0,Ovarian repositioning in pediatric cancer patients: Flexible techniques accommodate pelvic radiation fields.,"Treatments for childhood cancer and consequent long-term survival rates continue to improve. As the success of these therapies advances, premature ovarian failure and sterility have become an increasingly evident long-term morbidity. Abdominal and pelvic radiation have been specifically shown to induce early menopause and decreased fertility. In order to minimize radiation injury, we utilized novel techniques to reposition ovaries in two girls with pelvic tumors prior to initiation of pelvic radiation. One girl with a sacral Ewing sarcoma underwent laparoscopic anterior suspension of the ovaries, using a simple and easily reversible technique. The second patient, who underwent hysterectomy for a recurrent uterine rhabdomyosarcoma, underwent widely lateral and cephalad repositioning of the ovaries. Both procedures were well tolerated, with no significant morbidity. In both cases the ovaries were moved well beyond the planned radiation field. We propose that open or laparoscopic ovarian repositioning in children is a simple, flexible, and reversible option to reduce radiation injury to the ovaries in pediatric cancer patients."

In all 131 patients several findings were present in combined form that would have permitted abdominal surgery only, provided laparoscopy had not been performed. 49 patients were operated upon via the abdominal approach even though they had been subjected to laparoscopy. In 82 patients, the more favourable vaginal approach was rendered complicated by additional findings (in 22, antefixating preliminary operations on the uterus after Doléris or Baldy; in 29, cystic adnexal tumours; in 31, adhesions or unclear conditions of pain following known or unknown previous surgery).

CD009786,0,16873081,0,[Impact of surgical access on staging of early borderline and invasive tumors of the ovary].,"The objectives were to evaluate the impact of the surgical approach on the staging of borderline tumors and early-stage malignancies of the ovary. We retrospectively reviewed cases of borderline and invasive ovarian tumors stages Ia through Ic treated surgically between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 2001. We compared the rates of potentially harmful procedures according to the surgical approach. The quality of surgical staging was assessed by examining each required procedure and by determining a score. The influence of variables related to patient characteristics, preoperative workup, and initial surgery on staging quality was tested by univariate analysis. Variables independently associated with staging quality were entered in a logistic regression model. SPPS 7.5 and STATA 8 software was used for statistical tests. Of 118 patients with borderline tumors, 48 (41 %) underwent laparoscopic surgery, 54 (45 %) laparotomy, and 16 (14 %) laparoscopy converted to laparotomy. Surgery was conservative in 57 % of cases overall ; this proportion was significantly greater with laparoscopy than with laparotomy (p < 0.05) and in younger women (p < 0.001). Intraoperative tumor rupture occurred in 9 % of patients, with no significant difference across surgical approaches (p = 0.1). Bag extraction was used in 19 (40 %) of 48 laparoscopically treated patients. Staging was incomplete in 73 % of patients. By univariate analysis, bilateral adnexectomy and, to a lesser extent, age > 44 years, laparotomy, hysterectomy, and treatment after 1995 predicted at least partial staging. Factors independently associated with at least partial staging in the multivariate model were treatment after 1995, bilateral adnexectomy, and hysterectomy. Of 178 patients with invasive tumors, 34 underwent laparoscopic surgery, 114 laparotomy, and 30 conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy. The laparotomy group was characterized by significantly older patient age and larger tumors, compared to the laparoscopy group. Staging was often inadequate after initial surgery, most notably with low rates of paraaortic lymphadenectomy (0 % in the laparoscopy group, 18 % in the laparotomy group, and 33 % in the conversion group). Staging is often less complete with laparoscopy than with laparotomy. In patients with invasive cancer, inadequate initial staging is common, most notably when laparoscopy is used. The surgeons training seems of major importance."

We present 2 cases with the classical triad of advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma-ascites, abdominopelvic masses and elevated serum CA-125 levels. Laparoscopic examination revealed peritoneal nodules which on biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation and no malignant cells. Patients were started on anti-tuberculous therapy and on follow-up their symptoms as well as CA-125 levels normalized. Medical awareness of peritoneal tuberculosis is lacking and many young women with this disease undergo unnecessary extended surgery. Diagnostic laparoscopy combined with peritoneal biopsy seems to be a sufficient and safe method to provide a definitive diagnosis for this curable infection.

At sonographic examination, the majority of borderline tumors were multilocular. Serum CA-125 levels were elevated in 32.1%, CA-19-9 in 17.4%. In contrast, ACE levels were constantly normal. Twenty-four out of 43 patients (55.8%) had serous tumors, 18 (41.9%) had mucinous tumors and 1 (2.3%) had endometrioid tumor. Among, the 43 patients, 9 (20.9%) had first laparotomic approach and 34 had first laparoscopic treatment. Seven out of 34 patients treated by first laparoscopic approach had a laparoconversion (2 for presumption of invasive carcinoma and 5 for failure of laparoscopic procedure). Therefore, 27 had exclusive laparoscopic management. Among the 43 patients, 22 had conservative treatment and 21 radical surgery. The mean follow-up of patients was 41 months. Thirty-seven patients (86.1%) were alive without recurrence, 4 had a recurrence (9.3%), 1 patient (2.3%) was lost to follow-up and the last died of intercurrent disease.

CD009786,0,16396153,0,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.,"Primary debulking surgery by a gynecologic oncologist remains the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer. Optimal debulking surgery should be defined as no residual tumor load. In retrospective analyses, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery does not seem to worsen prognosis compared to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, we will have to wait for the results of future randomized trials to know whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is as good as primary debulking surgery in stage IIIC and IV patients. Interval debulking is defined as an operation performed after a short course of induction chemotherapy. Based on the randomized European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Gynecological Cancer Group (EORTC-GCG) trial, interval debulking by an experienced surgeon improves survival in some patients who did not undergo optimal primary debulking surgery. Based on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 152 data, interval debulking surgery does not seem to be indicated in patients who underwent primarily a maximal surgical effort by a gynecologic oncologist. Open laparoscopy is probably the most valuable tool for evaluating the operability primarily or at the time of interval debulking surgery."

CD009786,0,19264478,0,Cryopreservation and autotransplantation of human ovarian tissue prior to cytotoxic therapy--a technique in its infancy but already successful in fertility preservation.,"Increasing survival rates in young cancer patients, new reproductive techniques and the growing interest in quality of life after gonadotoxic cancer therapies have placed fertility preservation as an important issue to oncologists, fertility specialists and patients. Several techniques are now available for fertility preservation in these patients. A new promising method is cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian cortex. Ovarian tissue can be extracted by laparoscopy without any significant delay of gonadotoxic therapy. The tissue can be cryopreserved by specialised centres of reproductive medicine and transplanted in case the women experience premature ovarian failure (POF). This review summarises the European expertise on cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian tissue, following around 30 reported transplantations globally, resulting in six live births and several ongoing pregnancies. It emphasises that fertility preservation by the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is a new but already a successful clinical option, which can be considered for selected cancer patients."
CD009786,0,7729731,0,Comparison between soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors and CA125 in peritoneal fluids as a marker for epithelial ovarian cancer.,"The levels of the soluble forms of the membrane-bound receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), p55 and p75, were assessed in peritoneal fluid samples from 50 patients with ovarian cancer, from 20 patients operated for benign pelvic masses, and from 26 healthy women undergoing laparoscopy. The 95% cutoff for normal levels were 14.0 and 5.2 ng/ml for p55 and p75, respectively. In patients with active ovarian cancer, elevated levels of p55 and p75 were found in 54 (p55) and 84% (p75) of the patients, and elevated levels were seen in all histologic types. The levels correlated with peritoneal fluid quantity and with stage of disease. Among 20 patients operated for benign pelvic masses, 1 patient had elevated p55 and 8 patients (40%) had elevated p75. The concentration of CA125 in peritoneal fluids showed a 95% cutoff value in healthy individuals of 8.950 U/ml; and elevated CA125 levels were found in 7 patients with ovarian cancer (14%) and in none of the patients with benign masses. The results indicate that in peritoneal fluid, measurement of soluble TNF receptors, and particularly of p75, has an increased sensitivity and accuracy over CA125 in distinguishing ovarian cancer from benign pelvic masses."

CD009786,0,10378217,0,Laparoscopy in gynecologic malignancies.,"One of the cornerstones of gynecologic cancer surgery is the assessment and removal of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Numerous reports have demonstrated that, when performed by highly skilled individuals, laparoscopic lymphadenectomies can be performed safely. This has led to the investigation of laparoscopy in the surgical staging and treatment of patients with ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. This very promising approach has the potential to revolutionize numerous aspects of the management of gynecologic malignancies. However, it must be emphasized that the use of laparoscopy for gynecologic malignancies is still in its infancy. Studies that provide complication rates and long-term results are just beginning to be reported. More clinical data are necessary before the laparoscopic techniques are accepted as new surgical standards. Ongoing, prospective clinical trials will help answer many of the questions regarding the safety and efficacy of gynecologic laparoscopy. Until more data accumulate, operative laparoscopy will remain a promising, but unproven, tool in the management of patients with gynecologic malignancies."

Most cases are asymptomatic and found incidentally at autopsy or unrelated operation. These leiomyomas tend to be singular, small, and unilateral, with a resultant rare preoperative diagnosis. They are often managed with laparotomy, as seen in the literature review. Therefore, preoperative imaging is never reported. We describe a case of leiomyoma of the fallopian tube, which was suspected before operation and treated by laparoscopic approach. Transvaginal ultrasound clearly showed a hypoechoic solid mass separate from the left ovary and uterus in a 44-year-old woman. Color Doppler ultrasound detected low impedance flow in this mass. Diagnostic laparoscopy and the follow-up laparoscopic salpingoectomy revealed a primary leiomyoma of the fallopian tube.

She was found to have extensive intralymphatic carcinoma in both breasts, with only focal minimal breast parenchymal involvement, and residual metastatic carcinoma in bilateral sentinel lymph nodes. Further work-up revealed pelvic ascites and omental nodularities. The patient underwent laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which revealed high-grade serous carcinoma involving both ovaries and fallopian tubes. Molecular testing of tumor from the ovary and axillary lymph node showed an identical pattern of allelic loss, confirming a common origin for both tumors.

CD009786,0,12413936,0,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the management of ovarian cancer.,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to the administration of chemotherapy before definitive surgery is performed; this approach was introduced into the management of ovarian cancer approximately one decade ago, initially for use in women who were medically unable to tolerate aggressive cytoreductive surgery. Subsequently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was employed in women who, by diagnostic imaging analysis, were unlikely to undergo successful optimal cytoreductive surgery. Only very limited data are available on the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the management of women with apparent advanced ovarian cancer; these data are derived mainly from single institution experiences and suggest that this approach may increase disease-free survival but does not improve overall survival for the patient. However, it has consistently enhanced the feasibility of optimum surgical cytoreduction once neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been administered. Reduced blood loss, and shorter operations, intensive care unit stays and overall hospitalizations have been well documented. The methods for selecting candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy vary among institutions. Non-optimal surgical cytoreducibility has been assessed on the basis of diagnostic imaging studies, laparoscopic assessment and/or laparotomies. Currently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is most beneficial for women who are medically impaired and unable to tolerate aggressive cytoreductive surgery and for women who are found to have such aggressive cancers that optimal cytoreductive surgery does not appear by diagnostic imaging or direct visualization to be possible."

The increasing popularity of fine needle biopsy and laparoscopy created a demand for using these techniques to diagnose ovarian masses. Ovarian masses were aspirated prior to, during, or after laparotomy and laparoscopy. The cases included a variety of nonneoplastic cysts and benign and malignant neoplasms. The nuclear and cytoplasmic features of the aspirated cells, the background material and the presence of other structures such as hair, and psammoma bodies and hyaline bodies made it possible to classify most tumors regarding their behaviors as well as their specific type. Malignant neoplasms in general produced more cellular specimens than benign tumors. It was difficult to differentiate between some types of sex cord/stroma neoplasms. Aspiration cytology, which can be performed through a laparoscope transvaginally, transrectally, or transabdominally is a safe, noninvasive, and relatively reliable technique.

CD009786,0,16966069,0,Image guided biopsy in the management of cancer of the ovary.,"When used in the context of multidisciplinary team discussion, image guided biopsy using ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) guidance is of value in planning management of women with suspected ovarian cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of uncertain aetiology. It is essential in women believed to have ovarian cancer but with poor performance status or with advanced disease believed beyond the scope of primary cytoreductive surgery for whom staging surgical pathology will not be obtained. It provides a site-specific primary tumour diagnosis in 93% of cases and it should replace diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy for this purpose. It allows provision of primary (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy based on a firm histological diagnosis. It is mandatory in women with a history of cancer whose metastases may mimic ovarian cancer (e.g. breast, GI tract, melanoma). More women with prior breast cancer who re-present with peritoneal cancer will have a new gynaecological primary than recurrence of their original primary tumour; the two options require radically different therapies. Finally it is a valuable problem solving tool in situations of diagnostic uncertainty, e.g. unusual imaging patterns of disease such as PC with bilateral solid ovarian masses or non-enlarged ovaries and with an unusual tumour marker profiles suggesting primary tumours outwith the ovary. The technique is simple, safe and effective and can be combined with palliative drainage of ascites at the same procedure."

CD009786,0,7556836,0,Laparoscopic management of malignant ovarian cysts: a 78-case national survey. Part 2: Follow-up and final treatment.,"This paper reports a retrospective multi-institutional French survey carried out in 1992 to determine the incidence of laparoscopic management of malignant ovarian cysts. Of 5307 ovarian lesions treated endoscopically, 78 were malignant (1.47%) including 60 borderline tumours (77%) and 18 ovarian cancers (23%). Laparoscopic treatment was puncture in 23% of cases, partial exeresis in 51% and total removal in 26%. Laparotomy was immediately performed in 25% of the cases and as a second stage procedure in 58% (mean delay: 78 days). Laparotomy was not performed in 16% of the cases. Our findings suggest that laparoscopic management of ovarian lesions that subsequently prove to be malignant is not uncommon. To prevent the risk of metastasis, thorough pre-operative and per-operative evaluation is mandatory. In 22.4% of the patients presenting lesions in this study, laparoscopic tampering resulted in an upgrading of FIGO stage."

Conventional karyotyping was supplemented with fluorescent in situ hybridisation techniques in order to confirm the presence of Y chromosomes. One patient is a phenotypic female with karyotype 45,X/46,X,idic(Y)(q11.2). She underwent a laparoscopic gonadectomy at which streak ovaries without evidence of gonadoblastoma were removed. The second patient presented as a virilised female with karyotype 45,X/47,XYY. At laparoscopy, she was found to have mixed gonadal dysgenesis with a gonadoblastoma in situ. We recommend early gonadectomy in female children presenting with gonadal dysgenesis and the presence of a Y chromosome although once the gonadoblastoma locus on Y chromosome gene has been cloned it may be possible to identify those patients who have a low risk of developing gonadoblastoma."

Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent further sequelae including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Not all patients, however, present with pelvic pain, pelvic mass, fever, and leukocytosis. We present the case of a sexually active 15-year-old black girl who presented with mild abdominal pain and excessive vaginal bleeding without pelvic mass, fever, or leukocytosis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 66 mm/h. Pelvic ultrasound revealed bilateral complex ovarian masses. At laparoscopy, the patient had bilateral tuboovarian abscesses with extensive adhesions to the pelvic side walls. This case illustrates the need for a high index of suspicion of tuboovarian abscess in sexually active adolescents."

We believe that its occurrence during pregnancy has not been previously reported. The patient was a 32-year-old woman who during her pregnancy was noted to have a progressively enlarging, unilocular left ovarian cyst. Beginning at 18 weeks gestation, the fetus required multiple platelet transfusions for severe alloimmune thrombocytopenia. A viable baby girl was delivered by cesarean section at 39 weeks gestation. At that time, an ovarian cystectomy also was performed. When the histology of the tissue subsequently became known, a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed for gynandroblastoma. One year later, at the time of laparoscopic sterilization, the examination of the pelvis was normal."

Accidental cyst rupture was more frequent when a total laparoscopic approach was used (26/174 or 15% versus 39/140 or 28%; P = 0.005), but there were no cases of intraperitoneal spillage when an endoscopic bag was used. Two cases of granulomatous peritonitis developed out of 26 women with intraperitoneal spillage of cyst contents (8%). We conclude that the risk of granulomatous peritonitis can be minimised by undertaking laparoscopic removal of dermoid cysts with the routine intraoperative use of an endoscopic retrieval bag to prevent intraperitoneal spillage of cyst contents."

Intravenous metamizol was administered and when pneumoperitoneum was performed she developed severe hypotension and bronchospasm. Anaphylactic reaction was suspected, all drugs were suspended, and 2 doses of intravenous adrenalin (0.2 and 1 mg) were injected followed by continuous perfusion. Because response was slow and given the unknown origin of the tumor, the possibility of a carcinoid crisis was considered. When an intravenous bolus dose of octreotide was administered, pressure recovered, patient was extubated and could be transferred asymptomatic to the recovery ward. Tests later ruled out carcinoid syndrome, whereas tryptase levels in blood extracted during surgery and allergy tests confirmed an anaphylactic reaction to metamizol. Carcinoid crisis can be difficult to distinguish from anaphylactic reaction because the clinical pictures are similar. Anesthetic management of carcinoid crisis has been facilitated by administration of octreotide. Less is known about the use of octreotide to treat hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy based mainly on the drug's ability to produce splanchnic vasoconstriction. This is probably the reason why octreotide resolved our patient's shock in a context of systemic vasodilation caused by the anaphylactic reaction."

Individual and regional variation in surgical practice and factors influencing surgical practice were assessed. A postal questionnaire was sent to all 1536 consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology currently practising in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with a 52.7% response rate. Approximately 60% of hysterectomies were abdominal, 37% vaginal and 4% laparoscopic-assisted, with junior consultants performing a greater proportion of hysterectomies vaginally. There was a wide variation in method of hysterectomy, both individually and regionally. Only 21% of consultants would routinely consider performing prophylactic oophorectomy and of these the majority would perform this procedure in women aged between 46 and 50 years old. This large variation in surgical practice indicates a need to form a consensus on optimal surgical techniques and to ensure adequate surgical training for all gynaecologists."
CD009786,0,22543911,0,Inherited risk of ovarian cancer and the implications for screening.,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is a disease normally diagnosed at late stages, when survival rates are particularly poor. Diagnostic screening strategies are currently ineffective at detecting diseases at the earliest most treatable stages. This is confounded by the relative rarity of the disease. Stratifying the population according to genetic, lifestyle, and/or epidemiological risk factors could improve early-stage screening approaches by enriching the population for individuals at greatest disease risk. If lifetime risks are substantial, surgical interventions such as laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy could be offered to women to eliminate altogether their risks of primary cancer of the ovary. There have been significant recent advances in characterizing genetic risk factors for a multitude of cancers, including ovarian cancer. This research has been driven by technological advances that enable very high throughput DNA scanning approaches in tens of thousands of subjects. This article summarizes the progress in identifying genetic alleles for ovarian cancer in the population and the implications for clinical intervention strategies based on identifying the proportion of the population at greatest risk of disease."

Laparoscopy has multiple benefits in the cancer patients, including image magnification to visualize metastatic or recurrent disease and improved dissection in challenging areas such as the paravesical and pararectal spaces. There is limited bleeding from small vessels because of the pressure from pneumoperitoneum, decreased hospital stay, and rapid recovery. Postoperative chemotherapy or radiation can be initiated earlier, and radiation complications from bowel adhesions are minimized. Significant progress has been made in the last 2 decades in gynecologic malignancy. In this study, the application of laparoscopy in cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer will be presented."

However, recent studies argued against attempts to remove every last vestige of tumor in patients with many large tumor masses in the upper abdomen. Successful secondary cytoreduction at second surgery may improve survival in some selected patients. The change from a clinical to a surgical staging for endometrial neoplasia undoubtedly improved the accuracy of staging, but it remains to be seen if appropriate clinical treatment of high-risk patients improves survival. Large loop excision of the transformation zone has become increasingly popular for treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Lesions with no more than a 3-mm depth of invasion and with no vascular space involvement may be treated by simple hysterectomy. The morbidity and postoperative mortality with treatment of invasive squamous carcinoma of the vulva have been reduced by modifying the extent of vulvar and groin dissection. Recent studies suggested that the femoral nodes should be removed when performing inguinal lymphadenectomy. Laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomies and even laparoscopically assisted radical hysterectomies have been reported in patients with gynecologic malignancies.

To better understand this phenomenon, we compared pathologic findings in these laparoscopic and total abdominal hysterectomies performed for uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Reports from 58 robotically assisted laparoscopic and 39 abdominal hysterectomies with grade 1 or 2 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinomas were reviewed for stage, depth of invasion, vascular space involvement, uterine weight, and lymph node metastases. In addition, attention was given to possible procedural artifacts, including vertical endomyometrial clefts, and inflammatory debris, benign endometrial glands, and disaggregated tumor cells in vascular spaces. All foci with vascular involvement were reviewed by three gynecologic pathologists. Nine of the 58 (16%) laparoscopic and 3 of the 39 (7%) abdominal hysterectomies contained vascular space involvement based on the original pathology reports (P-value=0.0833). No one histologic feature consistently distinguished laparoscopic from abdominal cases on blind review of the available cases. Disaggregated intravascular tumor cells were significantly associated with reported vascular involvement in both procedures (P-values<0.001 and 0.016), most of which were corroborated on review. Laparoscopic procedures tend to have a higher index of vascular involvement, which is associated with lower stage, fewer lymph node metastases, and less myometrial invasion; however, pathologists cannot consistently determine the procedure on histologic findings alone. Moreover, there is significant inter-observer variability in distinguishing true from artifactual vascular space involvement, even among pathologists at the same institution. The clinical significance of apparent true vascular space involvement seen adjacent to artifacts is unclear, as is the impact of laparoscopic hysterectomy on recurrence risk."

Lymph nodes were free from invasion. A 7 cm ovarian cyst developed during follow-up and after a 2 month regimen of lynestrenol, coelioscopy with peritoneal lavage was performed. The pathology diagnosis was papillary cystadenocarcinoma requiring laparotomy which revealed invasion of both ovaries, neoplasic granulations and involvements of the epiloon. Exceresis of the trocar tract also showed tumoural invasion. Pathology examination favoured metastatic extension of the breast cancer. A 6-month chemotherapy was programmed before a second look. This case illustrates the risk of neoplastic dissemination after puncture or rupture of a cyst misdiagnosed as benign. In patients with a history of breast cancer, the risk of discovering a primary malignant ovarian cancer at coelioscopy is 9%. Metastases are found in 15-30% of the cases compared with 0.4 to 1.8% in unselected subjects. Prevention of operative dissemination relies on cystectomy without opening the cyst. This may require transforming the coelioscopy into a laparotomy which should not be considered as an operative failure but as a necessary method of preventing dissemination and clinical aggravation. Careful history taking, a rigorous coelioscopy technique and extension to laparotomy in cases with suspected diffusion should reduce the number of dramatic situations where the malignant process had not been suspected in the precoelioscopic diagnosis."

The application of these techniques to oncologic surgery, which used to be basically the most invasive procedure, has become an important issue when considering patient well-being. For cervical and endometrial cancer we can perform a simple hysterectomy, type II or a type II radical hysterectomy as well as a pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. For ovarian cancer endoscopic procedures are advantageous for surgical staging, and even debulking surgery is possible in selected cases. The short-term outcome is excellent because post-operative recovery is quick, resulting in no delays in adjuvant therapy and a quick return to normal activity. As for the long-term results, although the number of cases and the observation period are limited, at present the outcome does not differ greatly from the results of conventional laparotomy."

A 68-year-old female, who had undergone total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for scirrhous gastric cancer of Stage IIIA, was admitted because of ovarian metastasis. Laparoscopic bilateral ovariectomy was performed for ovarian metastases of the gastric cancer (Krukenberg tumor) 6 months after gastrectomy. Seven months after gastrectomy, 11-course of S-1 treatment (80 mg/m2) for bilateral ovarian metastases of the gastric cancer was administered.

The antibodies used were Ca 1 or Ca 2, anti-CEA, and HMFG-2 or E29. All these are directed against epithelial antigens and are expressed on most malignant epithelial cells and weakly or not at all on mesothelial cells. It was hoped that these reactions would confirm diagnoses made by conventional cytology and possibly show malignant cells which had not already been identified. Of 28 patients with malignant disease (chosen to exclude any with frank ascites), eight gave positive immunochemical reactions, only four having been reported positive from conventional examination. Of 77 patients without malignant disease, HMFG-2 or E29 gave positive reactions in seven, Ca 1 or Ca 2 in two, and anti-CEA in two (reactions with plasma cells being disregarded). Some misleading reactions were probably due to endometrial cells. It was concluded that the antibodies used in this study are not sufficiently specific or sensitive to allow immunocytochemical staining to replace conventional cytological diagnosis but are a useful supplementary aid."

Sixteen patients had previously received cis-platinum containing combination chemotherapy systemically. Seven patients had microscopic residual disease at the start of intraperitoneal therapy, eight had macroscopic disease of 5 mm in diameter or less, and three had disease of 6-10 mm in diameter. The drug was administered weekly in 2 L of Ringer's lactate solution via an indwelling Tenckhoff catheter, and the dose ranged from 30-270 mg per cycle (median 120 mg). The dwell time was 20 minutes. After 12 cycles, response was assessed by open laparoscopy (six patients), laparotomy (eight patients), or peritoneal cytology (three patients). One patient developed distant metastases. Local and systemic toxicity was mild. Delays of therapy were necessary for eight of the 210 cycles because of hematologic toxicity. Of the 15 patients available for pathologic evaluation, four (26.6%) had a complete response and two (13.3%) had a partial response. Results of this pilot study suggest a possible role for intraperitoneal cis-platinum in the management of carefully selected patients with epithelial ovarian cancer."

Judicious preoperative evaluation along with careful patient selection can reduce the risk of operating on an unsuspected ovarian malignancy. Appropriate patient consent and planning should be obtained before the procedure, in case an ovarian neoplasia should be encountered. Although endoscopic pelvic biopsy, treatment and staging has been reported recently, the standard of care still appears to be by a laparoscopy. The removal of benign cystic teratomas of all sizes can be handled laparoscopically with the assistance of a retrieval bag or pouch. Reports of endoscopic treatment of ovarian remnant syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, and even prophylactic oophorectomy are appearing in the literature.

However, routine periodic pelvic examinations with laparoscopic examination of any significant adnexal enlargement in postmenopausal women should decrease the discovery time. Certainly, unexplained vaginal discharge or bleeding particularly when associated with a pelvic mass, should increase one's suspicion.

Her breast cancer was deemed metastatic by virtue of a supraclavicular lymph node, but she had no visceral or bone metastasis. She was begun on primary chemotherapy and her CA 125 normalized. CA 125 is a tumor-associated antigen that is most commonly seen in advanced ovarian cancer. It is predominantly derived from coelomic epithelium, which explains elevations in benign conditions or other malignancies. The significance of CA 125 elevations in breast cancer is uncertain. Although CA 125 production has been demonstrated in the normal breast, it has been reported most often as a marker of pleural involvement with metastatic breast cancer.

She was treated with intravenous antibiotics until resolution of symptoms. The pain recurred 1 month later, and the patient presented to our emergency department. At that time, she was afebrile and all laboratory results were normal or negative, aside from an elevated white blood cell count. Computed tomography suggested a right ovarian dermoid. At laparoscopy, however, the right tube and ovary were normal, and chronic appendicitis was confirmed.

A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all patients with apparent stage I epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent laparoscopic (laparoscopy group) or laparotomic (laparotomy group) surgical staging at the Center for Uterine Cancer, National Cancer Center, Korea, between January 2001 and August 2006. During the study period, 19 patients underwent laparotomic surgical staging and 17 patients underwent laparoscopic surgical staging. No cases were converted from laparoscopy to laparotomy. The two groups were similar in terms of age, body mass index, procedures performed, number of lymph nodes retrieved, and operating time. The laparoscopy group had less estimated blood loss (P = 0.001), faster return of bowel movement (P < 0.001), and a shorter postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.002) compared to the laparotomy group. Transfusions were required only in two laparotomy patients, and postoperative complications occurred only in four laparotomy patients. However, two patients with stage IA grade 1 and 2 disease in laparoscopy group had recurrence with one patient dying of disease. The accuracy and adequacy of laparoscopic surgical staging were comparable to laparotomic approach, and the surgical outcomes were more favorable than laparotomic approach. However, the oncologic safety of laparoscopic staging was not certain. This is the first report on the possible hazards of laparoscopic staging in early-stage ovarian cancer. In the absence of a large prospective trial, this technique should be performed cautiously."

Involvement of the diaphragm with metastatic ovarian carcinoma was found in 63% of all patients. This finding again necessitated a change in therapy, since the right hemidiaphragm is shielded along with the liver when abdominal radiotherapy is used. Peritoneoscopy supplied the only followable findings with which to gauge response to therapy in 40% of the patients and also supplied followable findings in 78% of all patients studied.

Comprehensive surgical staging is essential for precise prognostic determination and treatment planning for patients with apparent early-stage ovarian cancer. Although randomized trials are lacking, the survival advantage associated with optimal primary cytoreduction has been consistent and reproducible. With increasing radicality of cytoreductive surgical techniques and sophistication of postoperative care, it appears that an ""optimal"" surgical procedure is that which leaves the patient with no visible residual disease. The survival benefits of cytoreductive surgery are also applicable to women with stage IV ovarian cancer, although the rate of success is somewhat attenuated compared with patients with stage III disease. Recent data also indicate that with appropriate surgical selection criteria, secondary cytoreduction is associated with a significant prolongation of survival for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

Serum levels of testosterone above 1.5 ng/ml and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate values above 6700 ng/ml are suggestive of tumour. Functional tests, laparoscopy and imaging modalities are often less efficient. Selective vein catheterisation enables the diagnosis and localisation of such hormone-producing neoplasms (Kirschner and Jacobs, 1971). This paper presents the case report of the diagnosis of a Leyding cell tumour of the right ovary by means of selective vein catheterisation.

Two groups of ovarian cancer patients were evaluated: those with optimally debulked advanced disease undergoing second-look procedures and those with presumed stage I disease undergoing surgical staging. Twenty-four of the 44 laparoscopic second-look procedures (56%) were positive for persistent disease. Five of these patients had microscopic disease only, in the omentum, washings, pelvic peritoneum, and in para-aortic lymph nodes (2 patients). In the group of 14 patients undergoing staging for presumed early ovarian carcinoma, metastatic disease was discovered in 8 (57%) patients. Two patients had peritoneal washings positive for adenocarcinoma; 3 had pelvic disease, 1 confined to a fallopian tube and 2 to the pelvic peritoneum; and 3 patients had para-aortic lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. There were no serious complications in this category. The average hospital stay was 1.6 days. Laparoscopic staging appears to be an accurate staging technique, and further investigation into the validity of this approach is warranted."

CD009786,0,18356093,0,[Borderline ovarian tumors: an update].,"Borderline ovarian tumors account for 15-20% of all ovarian epithelial tumors and are diagnosed primarily in young women who want to preserve their childbearing potential. Due to the absence of specific preoperative criteria, diagnosis is often made during surgery or after the anatomopathologic examination. The management of borderline ovarian tumors with early stage is well-known and conservative surgery must be chosen as much as possible. Laparoscopic approach is possible for these tumors, allowing diagnosis, staging and also treatment. For advanced stage, laparotomy is still recommended. Staging must be performed during the initial surgery because tumor stage is one of the most relevant prognostic factors. Restaging operation should be discussed when complete staging was not made during initial surgery. Because his prognostic and therapeutic impacts are not proved, restaging surgery remains controversial. For that reason, it seems important to define clinical and histological criteria for patients with a high risk of upstaging."

CD009786,0,8786211,0,Aspiration cytology of neoplastic and non-neoplastic ovarian cysts: is it accurate?,"To evaluate the role of aspiration cytology in the distinction between neoplastic and non-neoplastic ovarian cysts, we examined the cytology of 81 aspirates from 80 women 14-67 years of age. We then correlated results with subsequent histology or the clinical follow-up. Aspiration were performed during laparoscopy (32 cases) or immediately after surgical removal of the tumors (49 cases). The cysts ranged in size from 1.0 to 43.0 cm. Papanicolaou-stained cytospin preparations of samples were evaluated, and the lesions were classified into non-neoplastic (68 cases), benign neoplasms (four cases), and malignant neoplasms (nine cases). Cytologic impressions were correlated with histologic findings in 74 cases and with the clinical follow-up in the remaining seven. Nine of the 12 (75%) cystadenocarcinomas, including two serous neoplasms of low malignant potential (LMP), were correctly diagnosed as malignant by cytology. There were no false-positive results. On the other hand, of the 26 benign neoplasms (19 cystadenomas and seven mature cystic teratomas), only four teratomas (15%) could be subclassified specifically. The remaining 68 aspirates were classified as non-neoplastic. Seventy-seven percent of all proven non-neoplastic cysts measured < 8.0 cm, whereas 77% of all benign and malignant neoplastic cysts were > 8.0 cm. The overall diagnostic accuracy was improved from 63% to 69% when cyst size was taken into consideration. In malignant cysts the diagnostic sensitivity was 75%, specificity 100%, and overall accuracy 96%. We arrived at the following conclusions: Aspiration cytology is an accurate predictor of malignancy in ovarian cystic lesions, but because the sensitivity of the technique is not high enough, one should not rely on aspiration cytology alone; The differential diagnosis between cystadenocarcinomas and tumors of low malignant potential cannot be made by cytology; Although it is difficult to distinguish between benign neoplasms and non-neoplastic benign cysts, diagnostic accuracy will improve when the size of the lesion is considered; Aspiration cytology can provide particularly useful information in young women with functional cysts of the ovary to avoid an unnecessary operation; Acellular cyst fluids should not be considered nondiagnostic because they represent benign cysts in the majority of cases; false-negative results of fine-needle aspiration of cystic ovarian lesions is usually due to low cellularity of the sample and secondary degenerative changes; negative fine-needle aspiration results should be followed clinically."

CD009786,0,8774657,0,What is the role of reassessment laparoscopy in the management of gynecologic cancers in 1995?,"One hundred fifty-four patients with a diagnosis of ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma underwent 181 reassessment procedures to detect persistent or recurrent disease between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 1994 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. One hundred four laparoscopic procedures were performed. Eleven of these procedures were converted to laparotomy due to severe adhesions. Therefore, a total of 88 reassessment laparotomies were performed during the study period. Fifty-seven of 93 laparoscopies and 69 of 88 laparotomies were done as second-look procedures. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to patient age, tumor histology, degree of primary cytoreduction, and tumor stage or grade. Significant differences were found between laparoscopy and laparotomy groups in the following outcome variables evaluated: estimated blood loss (33.9 ml vs 164.9 ml, P = 0.0001), operative time (81.3 min vs 130.4 min, P = 0.0001), days of hospitalization (0.3 days vs 6.8 days, P = 0.0001), and direct cost/case ($2765 vs $5420, P = 0.0001). Despite obtaining 50% fewer biopsies with laparoscopy than laparotomy, the ability to detect disease was similar between these two groups: 47.3% vs 55.7% for all procedures and 52.6% vs 53.6% in the patients undergoing second-look procedures. Major complications in the laparoscopy group included transverse colon perforation (1), small bowel perforation (2), enterocutaneous fistula (1), and a retroperitoneal hematoma (1). Major complications in the laparotomy group included cystotomy (1), left ureteral injury (1), enterotomy (2), and SBO (4). Laparoscopy, when technically feasible, appears equally as effective as laparotomy in detecting persistent or recurrent malignant disease with less blood loss, less days spent in the hospital, less financial burden, and no increase in patient morbidity."

This is due to three factors: the simultaneous diagnosis of lesions, establishment of the prognosis and actual treatment: greater respect for the anatomy and physiological processes; the shift in the theatre of operations which is now represented by the pelvis itself and not the operating room we were used to. This surgical revolution has achieved a number of indisputable advances, especially where the adnexa are concerned. Tubo-peritoneal infertility, of course, for which Raoul Palmer developed laparoscopy; the approach relies on a thorough knowledge of the tubal condition. Ectopic pregnancy where laparoscopic treatment has become the standard. Ovarian cysts which raise the specific problems of discovering, and even more important, overlooking malignancy. Endometriosis for which surgical treatment has become appropriate again thanks to endoscopy. This revolutionary cycle is not yet complete for subperitoneal surgery is now being addressed. Hysterectomy, so highly symbolic for the gynecologist, is now regularly carried out in this manner. Even cancer surgery may now employ endoscopy, with second-look laparoscopy for ovarian cancer and above all lymphadenectomy techniques which were developed for a large part in France and will no doubt bring about a total change in the strategies for surgical treatment of cancer. Once the technical difficulties have been resolved radical hysterectomy has the potential to become the reference thanks to its precision and radicality. Prolapse too can draw benefit from endoscopic surgery. This is already the case for colpocervical suspension and other factors concerning prolapse are under study. We must not forget that this surgery must not only comply with the standard rules for surgery, but must also benefit from regulated and rigorous training. Collaboration with the engineers and equipment manufacturers is yet another new element with which French medicine is not yet very familiar."

We describe herein the case of a 22-year-old woman who underwent a right salpingo-oophorectomy for struma ovarii at the age of 12 years, who was admitted 8 years later with signs and symptoms of a left pelvic tumor. Laparoscopy detected a left ovarian endometriotic cyst and multiple nodules on the pelvic peritoneum, right lateral abdominal wall, diaphragm, vesical plica and liver. The diagnosis was abdominal and pelvic widespread dissemination of recurrent struma ovarii, with features consistent with the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient was treated with a combination of conservative surgery and two 131I administrations (cumulative activity of 350 mCi after dosimetric evaluation). Because of the high degree of hormonogenesis shown by the metastases, the first administration was performed following use of recombinant human (rh) thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to reach adequate TSH levels. To avoid the 'stunning effect' and to obtain high-quality scintigraphy, a whole-body scan was performed with 123I after rh-TSH and before the 131I therapy. We also discuss the potential role and the possible benefit of using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and ovarian tissue cryopreservation to preserve fertility in women treated with 131I for pelvic metastases from malignant struma ovarii."
CD009786,0,22117832,0,Laparoscopic treatment of ovarian dermoid cysts is a safe procedure.,"Experienced laparoscopic surgeons should consider laparoscopy as an alternative to laparotomy in management of ovarian dermoid cysts in selected cases. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety of laparoscopy in ovarian dermoid cysts treatment and risk of chemical peritonitis. We report 63 cases of patients (mean age of 37) with ovarian dermoid cysts originating from the ovary, treated from 2002 to 2010. Most of the patients underwent cysts removal. In 7 patients salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. We used 15 mm trocars for removing specimens. In patients with dermoid cyst rupture peritoneal cavity was washed out thoroughly with Ringer lactate and drained for 24-48 hours. All the material extracted was sent for a histopathology examination. The diagnosis of mature ovarian dermoid cysts was confirmed in 58 (92.63%) of cases and immature ovarian dermoid cysts in 5 (7.37%) cases. Dermoid cysts were composed of tissue developed from three germinative layers in 31 (49%) patients, from two germinative layers in 25 (40%), and in 7 (11%) patients from one germinative layer. No intra or postoperative complications occurred. No signs or symptoms of chemical peritonitis were observed regardless of cystic spillage or not. We conclude that the risk of chemical peritonitis can be minimized when undertaking laparoscopic removal of ovarian dermoid cysts if the peritoneal cavity is washed out thoroughly from spillage of cyst contents. Drainage of peritoneal cavity should be performed in the patients with the ruptured dermoid cysts."

Nevertheless, experimental data have shown that this pressure range can represent a hemodynamic risk factor as it may induce a decrease in the venous return to the right ventricle, a decrease in cardiac output, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin angiotensin system. We report two cases of acute renal failure that occurred soon after videolaparoscopy in young female patients without any evidence of ongoing renal disease. Patient A was 29 years old and was submitted to videolaparoscopic surgery in a follow-up program after surgical treatment of ovarian cancer; patient B was 15 years old and was submitted to the surgical removal of a monolateral ovarian cyst. In neither of the cases was it necessary to perform hemodialysis. Patient A underwent a renal biopsy under ultrasound guidance; optic microscopy showed only in ra- and extraglomerular capillary congestion. In both cases the acute renal failure resolved completely and the patients where discharged with normal renal function. Taking in to account that normal renal venous pressure levels are around 4 mmHg we think that a) a 15 mmHg pneumoperitoneum may represent a risk factor during videolaparoscopic surgery mainly if the patient's extracellular volume is not properly expanded; b) administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in order to prevent surgical pain may inhibit vasodilatory prostaglandin availability; c) onset of oliguria during the surgical procedure suggests that extracellular volume expansion is required."

Treatment with CHAP-5 resulted in more complete remissions as determined by laparatomy or peritoneoscopy (p = 0.004), better overall response (p = 0.0001), and longer overall survival and progression-free survival (p less than 0.002). Therapy, histological grade, and Karnofsky index were reliable predictors of overall response, whereas therapy, FIGO-stage, and size of residual tumour before chemotherapy were independent predictors for complete remission and for prolonged survival. Peripheral neurotoxicity was a major problem in patients assigned to the CHAP-5-group and was likely to be due to the simultaneous administration of hexamethylmelamine and cisplatin. The CHAP-5 regimen is one of the most effective regimens for the initial treatment of ovarian cancer."

All 40 patients have either disease progression or have completed the 12-month protocol. Eighty-seven percent of the patients (35) underwent optimal (less than or equal to 2 cm residual) debulking surgery before chemotherapy, in spite of the fact that 50% (20) were referred to Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) as inoperable after initial surgery elsewhere. There were no postoperative deaths and chemotherapy was started in less than or equal to 14 days in 97% of the patients. Of the 40 patients, 30% (12) achieved a pathologic complete remission (11) or a clinical complete remission (one patient refused second-look surgery). The estimated 3-year survival rate was 62%, but the 3-year progression-free survival rate was only 29%. The median survival time was 48 months. The estimated 3-year progression-free survival rate was 31% for residual disease less than or equal to 2 cm. For the five patients with residual disease greater than 2 cm, four died within 3 years. The median survival time of patients with less than or equal to 2 cm residual disease was 48 months, as compared with 21 months for those with greater than 2 cm residual disease. Although the estimated 3-year survival rate of 62% is noteworthy, the 3-year progression-free survival rate of only 29% is probably indicative that in spite of extensive debulking surgery and cisplatin-based chemotherapy as used in this protocol, the long range proportion of patients ""cured"" will remain small."

Ten patients had ovarian cancer, 12 had colorectal cancer, and one patient each had endometrial carcinoma and primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma. All ovarian cancer patients, three of twelve colorectal cancer patients, and one patient with endometrial carcinoma had received prior therapy. Patients received IL-2 100,000 U/kg every 8 hours intravenously (IV) for 3 days, and 2 days later underwent daily leukapheresis for 5 days. LAK cells were generated in vitro by incubating the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IL-2 for 7 days and were then administered IP daily for 5 days through a Tenckhoff catheter (Davol, Inc, Cranston, RI) together with IL-2 25,000 U/kg IP every 8 hours. All but one patient completed at least one cycle of therapy. Toxic side effects included minor to moderate hypotension, fever, chills, rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, oliguria, fluid retention, thrombocytopenia, and minor elevations of liver function tests; all of these rapidly improved after discontinuation of IL-2. One patient had a grand mal seizure, and one suffered a colonic perforation; these were felt to be treatment-related. IP fibrosis developed in 14 patients and limited repeated cyclic administration of this therapy in five patients. Two of 10 (20%) ovarian cancer patients and five of 12 (42%) colorectal cancer patients had laparoscopy- or laparotomy-documented partial responses. We conclude that LAK cells and rIL-2 can be administered IP to cancer patients, resulting in moderate to severe short-term toxicity and modest therapeutic efficacy. Further investigation of this form of adoptive immunotherapy modified to address the problem of IP fibrosis and with lower IP IL-2 doses is justified by these initial results."

Patients who undergo gynecological pelviscopic operations often experience in comparison to laparotomy less fever, require less postoperative analgesia and are able to tolerate a full diet within 24 hours of surgery. Very often they have a faster recovery and a shorter hospital stay than patients undergoing traditional abdominal or transvaginal operations. The endoscopic operative technique lays the foundation for minimal invasive surgery. The mainly organ-resecting gynecological laparotomy, aiming to avoid recurrence, is increasingly being replaced by pelviscopic organ preservative techniques. Meanwhile we tend to perform many hysterectomies laparoscopically assisted (LAVH). It avoids laparotomy in casesa of adhesions and high uterine tissue mass and seems to lower intraoperative risks such as infection by strong operative restriction of the vaginal approach. CISH (classic intrafascial S*E*M*M* hysterectomy, S*E*M*M denoting ""serrated edge macro-morcellated"") even leaves the pelvic floor intact.

Six days later, laparoscopy was done and methotrexate, 50 mg in 6 mL of normal saline, was injected into the ampullar mass of the right fallopian tube in two divided dosages. The serum beta-hCG levels then gradually decreased and returned to negative 60 days after the methotrexate injection.

The Roswell Park experience.,"Sixty-four patients with primary fallopian tube cancer treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute from 1964 to 1987 underwent retrospective clinicopathologic review. In 40 patients fallopian tube cancer was the only primary, but in 24 patients primary fallopian tube cancer was part of a multifocal upper genital tract malignancy. Of the 40 patients with unifocal fallopian disease, the median survival was 28 months. Only 15% of patients were alive and disease free with follow-up ranging from 22 to 141 months (median, 90.5 months). Survival was not associated with stage of disease, tumor histology, grade, or depth of invasion in this series. Fourteen patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy were evaluable for response. Three patients (21%) responded; two complete and one partial. Twelve patients without clinical evidence of disease underwent second-look procedures, ten laparotomy and two laparoscopy. Four of ten second-look laparotomies were negative. Secondary debulking was done in three of four patients with gross disease, one of which had a negative third-look laparotomy. Negative laparotomy, second-look or third-look, was associated with improved survival (P = 0.016). One of the two laparoscopies was negative, but the patient recurred. In the remaining 24 patients cancer of the fallopian tube was part of a multifocal upper genital tract malignancy. In 12 patients tubal disease was invasive, and in 12, it was in situ. Separate primaries occurred in the ovaries (n = 20); uterus (n = 7); and cervix (n = 2). This represents 1.3% of ovarian malignancies treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute during the study period. Fallopian tube cancer seems as virulent as ovarian cancer with few long-term survivors. It is frequently associated with other sites of upper genital tract malignancy. Second-look laparotomy is an important predictor of survival. Second-look laparoscopy may be useful if positive."

CD009786,0,9557831,0,Laparoscopic management of organic ovarian cysts: is there a place for frozen section diagnosis?,"Only benign ovarian cysts can be treated by laparoscopic surgery. Although clinical examination and the results of pre-operative work-up do make a real contribution in indicating the benign or malignant nature of cysts, only histology can provide the absolute diagnosis. In this context, the goal of this study was to establish whether there is any advantage in performing frozen section during laparoscopic surgical management of organic ovarian cysts. Between January 1989 and March 1996, 228 patients underwent an adnexectomy for an ovarian mass. After the pre-operative work-up and the diagnostic phase of laparoscopy, 26 patients (11.4%) presented with suspected signs of malignancy restricted purely to the ovary. These 26 patients underwent a laparoscopic adnexectomy with extraction of the excised tissues using an endoscopic bag, followed by frozen section. For all these patients the results of the frozen section concluded that the lesion was benign. In every case the definitive histological results confirmed the frozen section findings. This strategy enabled us to avoid laparotomy, especially for the nine post-menopausal patients whose adnexal masses appeared to be complex by ultrasound. These encouraging preliminary results need to be confirmed by a larger series of patients, so as to specify the place of frozen section in the laparoscopic surgical management of organic ovarian cysts."
CD009786,0,22815844,0,"A 46,XY female DSD patient with bilateral gonadoblastoma, a novel SRY missense mutation combined with a WT1 KTS splice-site mutation.","Patients with Disorders of Sex Development (DSD), especially those with gonadal dysgenesis and hypovirilization are at risk of developing malignant type II germ cell tumors/cancer (GCC) (seminoma/dysgerminoma and nonseminoma), with either carcinoma in situ (CIS) or gonadoblastoma (GB) as precursor lesion. In 10-15% of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis cases (i.e., Swyer syndrome), SRY mutations, residing in the HMG (High Mobility Group) domain, are found to affect nuclear transport or binding to and bending of DNA. Frasier syndrome (FS) is characterized by gonadal dysgenesis with a high risk for development of GB as well as chronic renal failure in early adulthood, and is known to arise from a splice site mutation in intron 9 of the Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1). Mutations in SRY as well as WT1 can lead to diminished expression and function of SRY, resulting in sub-optimal SOX9 expression, Sertoli cell formation and subsequent lack of proper testicular development. Embryonic germ cells residing in this unfavourable micro-environment have an increased risk for malignant transformation. Here a unique case of a phenotypically normal female (age 22 years) is reported, presenting with primary amenorrhoea, later diagnosed as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism on the basis of 46,XY gonadal dygenesis with a novel missense mutation in SRY. Functional in vitro studies showed no convincing protein malfunctioning. Laparoscopic examination revealed streak ovaries and a normal, but small, uterus. Pathological examination demonstrated bilateral GB and dysgerminoma, confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Occurrence of a delayed progressive kidney failure (focal segmental glomerular sclerosis) triggered analysis of WT1, revealing a pathogenic splice-site mutation in intron 9. Analysis of the SRY gene in an additional five FS cases did not reveal any mutations. The case presented shows the importance of multi-gene based diagnosis of DSD patients, allowing early diagnosis and treatment, thus preventing putative development of an invasive cancer."

Complete resection is mandatory for malignant lesions, and in the case of benign tumors preservation of healthy ovarian tissue is crucial. Diagnosis is based on clinical features (age and hormonal status), imaging and tumor marker levels. Laparoscopy is of great help in making a diagnosis and staging when the lesion is malignant. Laparotomy by a supra-pubic approach is, however, the only way to ensure a safe treatment of the lesion by avoiding any risk of tumor spillage, which constitutes a chance loss. Surgical treatment consists of complete ovariectomy for a malignant tumor and partial ovariectomy when the lesion is surely benign. Preservation of fertility is based on conservative surgery for uni- or bilateral benign lesions, and may be discussed in some selected cases of bilateral malignant tumors.

CD009786,0,138476,0,Advances in the staging and treatment of ovarian cancer.,The age adjusted death rate for ovarian cancer has remained unchanged for the past 20 years. Recent data obtained by staging ovarian cancer patients with lymphangiography and peritoneoscopy demonstrated that many patients with apparently localized disease actually have occult dissemination within the abdomen. These new staging techniques plus the determination of the histologic grade of anaplasia may permit a more precise determination of a patient's prognosis and therefore better design of therapeutic stategy. Radiotherapeutic techniques are being adapted to attempt to treat some areas of occult disease. Numerous single chemotherapeutic agents are capable of producing objective tumor responses. Preliminary data suggest that combination chemotherapy can increase the objective response rate above that seen with single agents. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether combination chemotherapy can prolong survival.

We used a Medline computer database search to conduct for pertinent articles through September 1996. Cross-referencing identified additional publications. We found that the majority of recurrences were in patients with adenocarcinoma cell type, advanced stage (far-advanced disease), and often with diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis, suggesting that port site metastases may contribute to the highly aggressive nature of the disease. Risk factors that contributed to early occurrence of port site metastases were ovarian cancers, presence of ascites, and diagnostic or palliative procedures for malignancy (P < 0.0001, P = 0.008, and P < 0.001, respectively). Practitioners should exercise extreme caution when using laparoscopic techniques to manage the care of these patients."

The aim of this study was to show the usefulness of laparoscopic surgical treatment of ovarian tumors suspected of benignity. From September 4, 1985 through December 1, 1989, 108 patients were operated on in our unit for ovarian tumors suspected of benignity (absence of clinical and ultrasound scanning signs of malignancy). There were 111 operations due to three recurrences. Operative laparoscopy was carried out 100 times. The laparoscopic operations were 71 transparietal cystectomies, 20 intraperitoneal cystectomies, 8 transparietal oophorectomies, and 1 intraperitoneal oophorectomy. Of these, 43 operations were performed in emergency situations and 57 were not. Eight patients were pregnant at the time of laparoscopic treatment, there were no miscarriages. Average operation time and hospital stay duration were 51.80 min and 3.27 days, respectively. Three borderline tumors were diagnosed (one through laparoscopy and two through histology) and were treated by secondary laparotomy. Operative laparoscopy was the only treatment for ovarian tumors 98 times out of 111 (88.28%). A histological diagnosis was obtained in every case. Laparoscopic treatment of the tumor was efficient and safe. For ovarian tumors suspected of benignity this technique is of double interest: diagnostic and therapeutic.

New techniques have changed the way of diagnosing and treating this condition. This study aims to demonstrate the value of laparoscopic surgery for ovarian cysts in the early months of pregnancy. From the 7th November 1985 to the 1st September 1989, eight pregnant women with less than 17 weeks amorrhoea consulted for ovarian tumours that were more than 6 centimeters in diameter. They were all operated on for ovarian tumours of more than 6 centimeters diameter and they were all operated on laparoscopically. Four operations were emergency and four non-emergency. In seven cases cystectomy was carried out transparietally and in one oophorectomy was. Laparoscopic surgery was possible in every case. These was no complication to the pregnancy due to the operation. Laparoscopic surgery permits early treatment of ovarian tumours in pregnancy without the risks of laparotomy.

A retrospective study was carried on 468 operative laparoscopy cases performed from September 1995 to September 1998 at Yonsei University College of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Patient characteristics, specimen pathology, perioperative morbidity, and perioperative complications were reviewed. The percentage of operative laparoscopy increased steadily from 20.7% in 1996, 33.9% in 1997, to 49.7% in 1998. The mean age of patients was 33.66.5 (mean +/- SD) years and the mean hospital stay was less than 2 days. Types of surgery performed were cystectomy (n = 234), salpingo-oophorectomy (n = 126), oophorectomy (n = 63), and fulguration (n = 45), in decreasing order. Depending on the pathology of the ovarian cyst, the mean operation time was in the range of 80 to 110 minutes. Perioperative complications included 5 cases of subcutaneous emphysema, 10 cases of abdominal wall hematoma, 7 cases of trocar site bleeding, 3 cases of bowel injury, and 1 case of bladder injury. In conclusion, operative laparoscopy in treating benign ovarian cysts provides advantages such as less need to perform laparotomy, smaller skin incision, less perioperative discomfort, minimal tissue handling and trauma, and shorter hospital stay. Nevertheless, the risk of unrecognized ovarian malignancy cannot be absolutely excluded, therefore careful patient selection is mandated."

The low positive predictive value for malignancy of the currently available preoperative examinations results in 5 to 220 surgeries performed for each case of pelvic malignancy detected, depending on the evaluation method and patient selection. Although extensively reviewed as an effective tool for the investigation and treatment of adnexal masses, laparoscopy is still underused for this purpose in postmenopausal women. Some reasons are uncertainty about the incidental diagnosis of a malignant lesion during laparoscopy, concern about the effect of laparoscopy over the course of a pelvic malignant lesion, and inadequate referral of patients at high risk to specialized centers with oncologic gynecologists. Identification of patients at low risk might also be inadequate, causing them to undergo unnecessary laparotomy. Herein we demonstrate through a comprehensive literature review that laparoscopy is a highly effective tool for investigation and treatment of suspected adnexal masses in postmenopausal women, both in general medical settings without oncologic backup and in specialized centers. The indications for laparoscopy in this context can be further expanded without oncologic harm if patients at low and high risk are appropriately selected for surgery at general and specialized settings, respectively."

Two groups of women were eligible to participate in this investigation: (i) asymptomatic postmenopausal patients or patients >50 years of age, and (ii) asymptomatic women >30 years of age with a family history of ovarian cancer. Ovarian volume was calculated using the prolate ellipsoid formula (length x height x width x 0.523). An abnormal sonogram was defined by (1) an ovarian volume >10 cm3 in postmenopausal women or >20 cm3 in premenopausal women, and (2) a papillary or complex tissue projection into a cystic ovarian tumor. All women with an abnormal TVS had a repeat sonogram in 4-6 weeks. Patients with persistently abnormal scans had a serum CA-125 determination, tumor morphology indexing, and color Doppler sonography. Ninety patients (1.4%) with a persisting abnormality on TVS underwent exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy for tumor removal. Thirty-seven patients had serous cystadenomas and six had primary ovarian cancers. Five patients had Stage IA ovarian cancer and one patient had Stage IIIB disease. Only one of the ovarian cancer patients had a palpable abnormality on pelvic examination, and none had an elevated (>35 u/ml) serum CA-125. All these patients are presently alive and well 1-5 years after conventional therapy. There was one false negative in this study, a 38-year-old white female who was noted to have a small ovarian cancer at the time of laparoscopic prophylactic oophorectomy 11 months after a normal scan. Over 17,000 screening years have been accrued and there have been no deaths from primary ovarian cancer in the screened population. A cost analysis of TVS screening is presented."
CD009786,0,8582588,0,[Laparoscopic preliminary surgery of ovarian malignancies. Experiences from 127 German gynecologic clinics].,"A controversial discussion has arisen between endoscopists and oncologists about laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer and borderline tumours. A questionnaire was mailed to 273 German Departments of Gyn./Obst. A response rate of 46% (127 hospitals) was obtained concerning the endoscopical technique used, the kind and delay of post-endoscopical cancer operation and the early findings (follow-up) in cases of ovarian cancer, dysgerminoma, malignant teratoma, tubal cancer and borderline tumours of the ovary. In this German survey it could be shown that laparoscopic management of malignant ovarian tumours was not uncommon between 1991-1994. Totally, 61% of ovarian cancer stage Ia and 84% of ovarian borderline tumours stage Ia have been reported without any pathological finding in laparotomy subsequent to laparoscopic management of the lesions. The 192 cases cited here are undoubtedly an underestimate of the real present frequency of endoscopically managed ovarian malignancies. Patients with this early ""negative"" report should be followed up carefully and may not permit conclusions that laparoscopic management of ovarian malignancies may be harmless for them. In 16% of the stage Ia borderline tumours and in 39% of the stage Ia ovarian cancer early spread has been found totally, demonstrating that implantations and metastases subsequent to the endoscopical procedure can be found even in an early follow-up phase. In 92.4% laparoscopic capsule rupture, tumour morcellement with intraabdominal spilling, subsequent cystectomy or adnectomy had been the technique of choice with additional rinsing of the intraabdominal cavity. This was harmful for the majority of patients if the subsequent cancer surgery by laparotomy was delayed for more than 8 days. Early progression of these cases to stage I c has been reported in 20% (7/36 cases) and to stage II-III in 53% (19/36 cases). Only in 7.4% the endobag procedure was used in laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer stage Ia. In ovarian cancer stage Ic-III (n = 50) an early seeding in the laparoscopic tract was reported in 52% (13/25) if subsequent cancer surgery by laparotomy was delayed more than 8 days. The endoscopical techniques and the early findings after an endoscopical management are reported in detail. In conclusion, in respect of common oncological standards the actual practice in laparoscopic management of ovarian malignancy is considered poor surgery. Capsule rupture, tumour morcellement and unprotected ""biopsy"" in the intraabdominal cavity and an additional delay of adequate cancer surgery are the main pitfalls of that procedure. For the overwhelming majority of patients undergoing such endoscopical procedures very early implants and metastases in the pelvis, the abdominal cavity or the laparoscopic tract have been found. It seems necessary that laparoscopic management of ovarian malignancies and borderline tumours under the present technical conditions are given up and that we should return to reliable standards of oncological surgery comparable to laparotomy. This should be discussed urgently."

On the other hand, menopausal symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency is an important contributor to the poor quality of life scores in gynecologic cancer survivors. Transposing of the ovaries into the paracolic gutters (ovarian transposition) was described in 1958 with the aim of protecting gonadal functions in reproductive-aged women treated by pelvic radiotherapy and/or surgery. Although the laparatomic approach has been used as a parallel to development in endoscopic surgery, today it is generally performed laparoscopically. However, there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of ovarian tranposition with respect to protecting gonadal functions. Moreover, metastasis to the transposed ovaries and port sites is another concern about this procedure.

However, this malignant tumor is very rare in the female reproductive system. A 58-year-old woman presented with acute abdominal pain, and computed tomography (CT) scan detected multiple masses measuring 4-6 cm in size with a fatty density in her adnexal region. Laparoscopic evaluation revealed tumors of the left fallopian tube with a normal left ovary. Histopathological evaluation of the resected pelvic tumors showed lipocytes and lipoblasts of various sizes, leading to diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma of the left adnexal region. This is the first known case of a liposarcoma arising from the fallopian tube.

It is generally unilateral and may involve either normal or pathologically enlarged ovary or tube, or both organs. The condition may be partial or complete, the latter often resulting in gangrene and marked exacerbation of symptoms. If untreated, it may progress to necrosis and gangrene, followed by peritonitis, which may be lethal. Prompt diagnosis, in which timely diagnostic laparoscopy and ultrasound evaluation of the pelvis may be helpful, provides the opportunity for prompt laparotomy with untwisting of the torsion and stabilization of the adnexa by suture and cystectomy, if possible, extirpation if not. Organ conservation requires a clear need to preserve reproductive or ovarian function, so cystectomy is generally preferable to oophorectomy."

Our patient is a 32-year-old nulligravida with long-lasting dysmenorrhea, urinary symptoms, and familiarity for endometriosis, who had voluntarily discontinued oral contraceptives. Various pelvic scans had not shown pathological findings. Five months following the last negative scan, she presented with pain and increase of abdominal girth.

At a 6-months follow-up, she was symptom-free and ultrasonography showed no recurrence. Endometriosis has still an unknown mechanism of proliferation and its clinical behavior or progression is highly unpredictable. Severe uropathy is commonly related to direct ureteral involvement, but can also depend on an ab-extrinseco compression by large, rapidly growing endometriomas.

Acute ovarian torsion in a pregnant patient is rare and is difficult to diagnose. Infarction caused by ovarian torsion will result if the twist is not unwound spontaneously or surgically in a timely fashion. The case is described of a 28-year-old primigravida who originally presented to the emergency department with right lower abdominal pain. The patient was ultimately found to have an extremely large cystic teratoma of the right ovary with concomitant torsion. Bedside ultrasonography is a highly accessible tool that can be used in a pregnant woman for screening a mass or ascites. Laparoscopic surgery has now been accepted as a safe modality for definitive diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Because acute ovarian torsion is not encountered frequently, timely diagnosis is required to prevent mortality and minimise morbidity. It is important to keep ovarian torsion in the differential diagnosis of any pregnant woman with acute abdominal pain. Emergency physicians should be aware of the possibility of acute ovarian torsion in pregnant women and should have a high index of suspicion. Early surgical intervention should be undertaken."

Acute appendicitis or acute ovarian torsion are rare and complicate the diagnosis. The case of a 6-year-old girl with urinary retention caused by ovarian torsion is reported, in which clinical presentation showed nonspecific complaints and ultrasound demonstrated a retrovesical mass. The long-standing ovarian torsion could only be diagnosed by laparotomy. This case once again demonstrates possible difficulties in obtaining a correct diagnosis, especially when imaging techniques reach their limits. Here, the anatomical structures had become so altered by adhesions of the omentum that they were no longer identifiable, rendering the advantageous, non-invasive laparoscopy ineffective. As a result, laparotomy became the most accurate and reliable method for obtaining a correct diagnosis. The occurrence of acute urinary retention with ovarian torsion can be explained by an earlier disturbance of the vegetative nervous system."

Patients with high luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (> 12 IU/l) had a better response than patients with lower LH values but a high LH: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio (> or = 2:1). However, the body mass index, ovarian volume or pretreatment testosterone values were not helpful in predicting the clinical outcome. Both responders (n = 22) and non-responders (n = 7) showed a decline in LH and testosterone and an increase in FSH 6-h mean values, following 15-min blood sampling 1 month after surgery, compared to the corresponding pretreatment levels. The magnitude of change was significantly higher for LH (p < 0.01) in responders but there was no difference in the corresponding values of the other hormones between the two groups (p > 0.05). Accordingly, unsupplemented ovarian electrocautery is better reserved for the treatment of patients with PCOD and high LH values.

Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a right adnexal mass. She had a slightly raised serum CA-125 level. Frozen section examination identified the right ovarian mass as a poorly differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. The surgically resected tumor and left ovary and omentum implants found during laparoscopy were diagnosed as DSRCT with Leydig cell hyperplasia. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were negative for epithelial markers but were positive for calretinin and inhibin. The patient is still undergoing chemotherapy at 8 months after initial presentation with partial response. This case showed that DSRCT with unusual immunohistochemical profiles and Leydig cells hyperplasia pose a diagnostic challenge. Molecular genetic techniques may help in these cases."

From June 1994 to June 1996, eight girls aged 4 months to 11 years (mean 6.1 years) underwent laparoscopic procedures for various ovarian pathologies at King Khalid University Hospital (7) and Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar (1). Four children had emergency laparoscopic surgery for lower abdominal crises; three of them were managed successfully for twisted adnexal lesions (2 simple ovarian cysts, 1 benign cystic teratoma), the fourth patient was converted to an open salpingo-oophorectomy. The other four patients had elective laparoscopic excision of adnexal lesions (two antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts and two mature ovarian cystic teratomas). There were no operative complications; the mean operative time was 76.25 min, the mean hospital stay 2.25 days. Our initial experience and technique are presented.

Determination of sex hormone levels in the fluid of cysts of the ovary showed normal level. Clear cell cystadenofibroma proliferation was found in ovarian stroma while atrophy in ovarian cortex. Histological examination revealed that the glands were lined by 1 or 2 layers of hobnail cells with scant to moderate pale or clear cytoplasm. The nuclei were small uniform, and flat to round.

Lymph node sampling, short of complete dissection, should be avoided because it may be insufficient to detect metastasis. In any case, laparoscopic lymphadenectomy as well as open surgery, should be in the hands of properly trained subspecialists in gynaecologic oncology. Of 97 patients with ovarian carcinoma studied in our hospital, 68% were treated by means of complete staging laparotomy (FIGO). Lymphadenectomy was spared in 14 cases with stage I tumours (mainly serous) without changes in overall survival. In 15% metastases in pelvic lymph nodes were present.

The benefits of laparoscopy include less postoperative pain, less blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, and a shorter recovery period with no significant increase in complications or morbidity. With emerging data, it appears that the risk of cancer recurrence does not increase with a minimally invasive approach. The incorporation of laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy has expanded the types of procedures performed for the management of certain gynecologic malignancies.

We performed an explorative laparoscopy in 15 women presenting with advanced ovarian carcinoma, and for whom the preoperative evaluation was considered unsatisfactory, to define the possibility of achieving a complete cytoreduction. We focused on three sites of carcinomatosis: bowel, liver pedicle, and right diaphragmatic dome. Laparoscopic evaluation was successful in all 15 patients. Four patients were considered to have unresectable carcinomatosis because of extensive involvement of the small bowel and therefore had no laparotomy. These women underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the following 2 weeks. Eleven patients were considered to have resectable peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). Ten women had no macroscopic residual tumor after surgery. A modified posterior exenteration was performed in five patients. The laparoscopic exploration had underestimated the liver pedicle involvement in two patients, but only one had an infracentimetric residual tumor after surgery. Laparoscopy is a reliable method of exploring PC in advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Laparoscopy may obviate the need for unnecessary laparotomy in many cases and may, therefore, contribute to a better quality of life for patients found to have unresectable disease."

A total of 13,739 laparoscopies were performed for this indication. Ninety-six percent of the respondents performed laparoscopy for this indication on premenopausal women only. Among respondents performing laparoscopy for suspected cancer, there was a 14% conversion rate to laparotomy, compared to 9% among those who performed direct laparotomies when cancer was suspected. An overall incidence of 4 per 1,000 cases of stage I ovarian cancer was found, and about 70% of women with persistent adnexal masses were managed by laparoscopy alone.

Effect with postoperative gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist treatment.,"In the period 1988-1990 this prospective study of 33 women with moderate or severe endometriosis who underwent laparoscopy for infertility and/or chronic pelvic pain, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of aspirating endometriotic cysts followed by administration of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist in reducing the size of ovarian endometriomas. The cysts (mean diameter, 4.5 cm; range, 2-7; unilateral, 21 cases; bilateral, 12 cases) were punctured, aspirated, washed and emptied completely. After laparoscopy, 15 subjects received goserelin administered as a 28-day subcutaneous depot for three months, whereas 18 patients undergoing simple observation constituted internal controls. Ultrasound scans were performed before and at one, three and six months after laparoscopy. One case and three controls requested surgery between the four- and five-month follow-up scans and did not complete the study. All the other women had recurrent cysts at the six-month scan. There were no significant differences in mean endometrioma diameter between the two groups at any observation time nor between prelaparoscopic and six-month ultrasound examinations within each treatment group. We conclude that aspiration and washing of endometriotic cysts, combined with postoperative administration of GnRH agonists or not, is ineffective."

A 16-year-old girl presented with abdominal distention, intermittent fever and weight loss. Physical examination and radiologic studies revealed massive ascites, generalized peritoneal thickening and slightly enlarged right ovary with a cystic mass and left pleural effusion. Serum CA 125 was 939 U/L (normal range: 0-35 U/L) and other tumor markers including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) were within normal range. Acid-fast stain and culture were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy were performed with the presumptive diagnosis of peritonitis carcinomatosis, and histologic examination revealed multiple granulomas with epithelioid cells and caseification necrosis which confirmed tuberculosis. Quadruple anti-tuberculosis treatment was administered and the patient's clinical findings and serum CA 125 level returned to normal. In conclusion, tuberculous peritonitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with ascites and elevated serum CA 125.

In this patient group the incidence of early or localised stages of ovarial malignomas FIGO I and II is 0.9 per cent. 81 laparoscopies were performed on patients suffering from localised stages of ovarial malignomas. 32% (n = 26) of these laparoscopised patients suffering from ovarial malignomas were subjected to extended diagnostic-surgical laparoscopy. These 26 localised stages of ovarial malignomas on which tumour-aggressive laparoscopy had been performed, were followed up and the relevant literature studied and processed. In 23 of the patients thus subjected to tumour-aggressive laparoscopic surgery we did not observe any deterioration of the prognosis during the treatment period (1-8 years). Problematic postoperative courses were seen in 3 patients; the reasons for this are discussed in the present paper. Measures resulting in opening of the tumours during diagnostic-surgical laparoscopy are neither accidental nor unforeseen incidents, but are rather part of an overall surgical strategy. If safety techniques are adopted-as described in this paper-diagnostic-surgical laparoscopy can be performed even during localised stages of ovarial malignomas without any presently recognisable adverse effect on patient prognosis."

Because of its rarity, there are various approaches to its treatment. We describe a case of malignant struma ovarii, in a 37 year-old female who presented for non cyclic, chronic pelvic pain and the presence of a right ovarian cyst with mean diameter of 7 cm. The patient was treated with laparoscopic right ovariectomy and with multiple biopsies of omental, left ovary and utero-sacral ligament. The patient underwent subsequently total thyroidectomy and radioiodine (131I) ablation. A Medline literature search was performed; we found 48 cases of malignant struma ovarii. The therapeutic management of the disease is very different in the described case; particularly after surgical removing of the ovarian mass, the treatment is still controversial. We think that the management of malignant struma ovarii could be the same than carcinoma of the thyroid, so after surgical removing of ovarian neoplasm, we recommend thyroidectomy, radiotherapy with 131I and levothyroxine suppressive therapy."

In these cases laparoscopy allowed to exclude the pelvic pathology or to quality to laparoscopic operation of ovarian cysts and intact tubal pregnancy. Diagnostic and operative laparoscopy give the possibility of quick diagnosis in diagnostically difficult cases and enables avoidance of laparotomy in many cases.
CD009786,0,8147211,0,DNA ploidy of ovarian and adnexal cyst fluid. A useful adjunct to cytology.,"It is increasingly common for cytology laboratories to receive ovarian, adnexal and pelvic cyst fluids obtained via sonographically directed aspiration and laparoscopic techniques, especially from women who are desirous of preserving fertility or who are undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Accurate characterization of such cysts is a worthwhile goal, given the superior prognosis for ovarian carcinomas that are diagnosed at an early stage. In an effort to improve upon the false-negative diagnosis rate associated with cytology, we evaluated DNA ploidy as a possible adjunctive criterion. We examined 55 benign, 3 borderline and 6 malignant aspirates received by our cytopathology laboratory; 35 were aspirated directly from the patient from clinically and ultrasonographically benign cysts, and 29 were aspirated from surgically removed benign (20) and malignant (9) cysts. Adjunctive DNA ploidy and cell cycle analysis was performed using the Cell Analysis Systems CAS-200 on Feulgen-stained cytologic smears of the 64 cyst fluids. Adequate material for DNA analysis was obtained from 33/35 in situ aspirated cysts and from 19/29 surgical specimen cysts. Forty-seven of 52 cytologically benign cysts were diploid. Of the 5 nondiploid benign cysts, 3 were follicle cysts (2 from hormonally stimulated IVF patients and 1 from a postpartum patient), and 1 was a benign cystic teratoma. Their nondiploid DNA pattern or tetraploidy may be due to a high proliferative index. The fifth nondiploid benign aspirate was from a resected benign epithelium-lined cyst; its DNA histogram contained a conspicuous tetraploid population. All 9 malignant cysts were cytologically malignant. Of the 3 borderline cysts, 1 was nondiploid, and 2 were diploid. All 6 fully malignant cysts were nondiploid; 2 of them were tetraploid. Based on our results, we conclude that DNA ploidy analysis of cells derived from ovarian and adnexal cyst aspirates is feasible (in 95% of cases) and relatively specific (90%) and has a relatively high negative predictive value (92%). The results are not sufficiently predictive of the histology of the lesion to warrant therapeutic intervention based on ploidy alone (sensitivity of nondiploid results, 78%; positive predictive value of nondiploid results, 58%). Nondiploidy should suggest consideration, but is not conclusive, of a malignancy diagnosis. There may even be prognostic implications to the ploidy pattern, particularly in borderline tumors, in which nondiploidy portends a poor prognosis."

The observation time ranged between 3 and 7 years. All patients had elevated CA 125 levels at the start of chemotherapy with subsequent normalization during treatment. Seventeen patients were classified as having no evidence of disease during the whole follow-up period. Out of 649 samples analyzed from these patients only 6 of the samples from 4 patients were greater than 35 U/ml (rate of false positives, 0.9%). These high values were all singular; the serum samples for the preceding and following months were normal. Out of 20 verified recurrences in 15 patients, 19 had elevated CA 125 levels (sensitivity, 95.0%). The CA 125 increase was the only sign that initiated clinical investigation in 16 recurrences (sensitivity for early diagnosis, 80.0%). With examination under anesthesia, fine needle aspiration for cytology, CT scan, and sometimes laparoscopy or laparotomy a relapse could be verified in 13 of these cases (sensitivity for the whole procedure, 65.0%). In 2 recurrences the increase in CA 125 was obvious at the same time as the clinical evidence of recurrence and in 1 case the elevation was delayed. One additional patient is presently under investigation because of an increase in CA 125. We conclude that monitoring with monthly determinations of serum CA 125 is a reliable method with very few false-positive values. We regard this as a step forward in the management of the follow-up of ovarian cancer patients."

The mean age of the group was 49.4 (30-80) years, mean weight 72.1 (44.5-114) kg, and mean parity 2.7 (0-8). All patients had preoperative urodynamic study to confirm genuine stress incontinence (GSI). Sixteen patients (14%) had dual pathology (GSI and detrusor instability). A transperitoneal approach was used in 93 operations and extraperitoneal in 20. The mean operating time was 108 (30-320) minutes and mean hospitalization 3.3 (1-10) days. In 13 women the operation was converted to laparotomy; 10 due to adhesions and diminished bladder mobility, 1 for inferior epigastric vessel injury, 1 for an ovarian tumour discovered incidentally at the procedure and 1 for equipment problems. Operative complications included 10 cystotomies (5 repaired laparoscopically), 2 extraperitoneal cases converted to transperitoneal, 1 inferior epigastric vessel injury, 1 vaginal tear, 1 suture through the bladder and 1 case of possible enterotomy oversewn at laparoscopy.

CD009786,0,11917373,0,"[Doppler ultrasonography in the diagnosis of ovarian cysts: indications, pertinence and diagnostic criteria].","To discriminate ovarian lesions is of particular importance in gynecological practice. Two main problems need answers: discrimination of benign and malignant adnexal masses and choice of the appropriate surgical treatment if necessary. Nearly 2% of the adnexal masses are ovarian carcinomas or border line tumors. It is now well established that ultrasonography is the gold standard for ovarian cyst diagnosis. The purpose of this work was to review the literature and to establish, with the evidence based medicine model, which parameters and existing diagnostic models using ultrasound and Doppler performs best in the evaluation of adnexal masses. Transvaginal sonography has demonstrated considerable advantage over conventional transabdominal sonography. However, transparietal sonography is still useful in large tumors. It is no longer reasonable to subject all patients undergoing pelvic sonography to bladder distension. Functional ovarian cyst characterization seems easy using sonography and Doppler. In case of complication, discrimination of such functional cyst may be difficult but spontaneous regression confirms usually the expectative management. Dermoid cysts and endometriomas seem to be easier to discriminate from other adnexal masses. Papillary formations on the inside of the cyst wall and masses with a non hyperechoic solid component are the most statistically significant predictors of a malignant ovarian mass. Ultrasound and morphologic parameters have a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 93%, that make this exam the gold standard for ovarian masses diagnosis. Another parameter is important: experienced hands with subjective evaluation seems to be one of the best ultrasound method for adnexal masses discrimination. Scoring system help differentiate benign from malignant masses (sensitivity 90%, VPP 50%). Doppler flow measurement and assessment of tumor vascularity by doppler energy increase the confidence with which a correct diagnosis is made. Moreover, combined US techniques and a diagnostic algorithm perform significantly better than morphologic assessment, color doppler or CA125 measurement alone. Logistic regression and neural network models are good methods and may be useful for malignancy prediction but the improvement is small and the concordance with histology far from 100%. In front of a benign and maybe functional cyst, spontaneous resolution may be controlled by sonographic exam at 3 and 6 months. Three-dimensional ultrasound and power doppler, contrast enhanced sonography, and sonography during the laparoscopic procedure are not still validated. Every suspicious ovarian mass needs sonography by an expert which can first use all the techniques and the different parameters to discriminate benign and malignant tumors. Secondly, after control if necessary, he can propose the patient for appropriate surgical treatment."

CD009786,0,7982547,0,[Diagnosis and therapy of adnexal tumors in postmenopause. A prospective study].,"The management of postmenopausal adnexal tumours is still controversially discussed. Approximately 30% of all postmenopausal tumours are malignant. The standard operative approach for these adnexal masses is still the exploratory laparotomy although the advantages of laparoscopic procedure are obvious, even in older patients. The aim of this prospective study was to find out to what extent diagnostic-operative laparoscopy is able to replace laparotomy in the therapy of postmenopausal adnexal masses. From January 1990 to August 1992, 169 postmenopausal patients entered the prospective study. After careful preoperative diagnostics, 63 patients underwent a laparotomy (group B) and 106 patients a laparoscopy (group A). 10 of these 106 cases underwent laparotomy after diagnostic laparoscopy (group Ab). The main operative procedure in group Aa was laparoscopic adnexectomy after Semm. Mean operative time and mean postoperative hospital stay were significantly lower in patients, who only underwent laparoscopic operation (group Aa). One case (0.9%) of the laparoscopically operated patients was subsequently found to be malignant (histologic assessment) and immediately treated by laparotomy with hysterectomy and contralateral adnexectomy. The combination of vaginal examination, vaginal/abdominal ultrasonography (tumor marker CA 125) and a sufficient preoperative diagnostic during endosurgery (no proliferations on the ovary or peritoneal surface, no ascites) reduces the risk of operating a malignant tumour by laparoscopy to a minimum. We believe that operative laparoscopy of postmenopausal adnexal masses is a safe and efficient method in carefully selected women."
CD009786,0,11917377,0,[Ovarian cyst: surgical indications and access].,"Laparoscopic treatment of adnexal masses is indicated when all criteria of a benign lesion are present: transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates a mass < 5 cm, with liquid or dermoid content, with less than 3 fine partitions (< 3 mm), a thin wall (< 3 mm), no vegetations, normal Doppler. Laparoscopy is also indicated for ""benign"" cysts measuring 5 to 10 cm if laparoscopy is feasible. Peroperative exploration is the rule. Since the benign or malignant nature of an ovarian mass cannot be determined macroscopically, precaution must be taken to avoid potential laparoscopic dissemination: use of an extraction pouch, instrument cleaning, cytotoxic agent (chlorexidine or povidone-iodine) for trocar tracts, prevention of gas leakage, 3-plane suture of trocar orifices measuring > 10 mm, short interval between laparoscopic diagnosis of cancer and onset of chemotherapy or complete surgery (1 week). In case of pre- or peroperatively suspected malignancy, cytology examination of the peritoneal fluid and careful peroperative exploration of the abdomen and pelvis with peritoneal biopsy as needed are required. Simple cystectomy or adnexectomy may be performed, depending on the age of the patient, while waiting for the final pathology report. Peroperative intraperitoneal rupture must be avoided, converting to laparotomy if needed. If several suspicious elements are found, median laparotomy is often recommended, particularly in case of suspected cancer with extra-ovarian involvement, or if there is a risk of peroperative rupture. Peroperative pathology of the adnexectomy specimen and peroperative exploration will depend on the operator's experience and the availability of pathology examination in the operating room. First line laparoscopy allows an analysis of the operability and choice of the most appropriate access."

There is not enough evidence to privilege cystectomy after needle aspiration over attempt to achieve enucleation of the cyst; however, uncontrolled rupture of the cyst is the risk associated with the latter procedure (NP5). Authors usually recommend extraction of the cyst through a bag (NP5). There is not enough evidence for or against ovarian suture. Benefits of adhesion barriers after ovarian cystectomy has to be proved. The majority of the authors perform a bilateral oophorectomy in case of unilateral postmenopausal cyst (NP5).

The cellular response to the therapy was evaluated and graded according to morphologic, that is, histologic and ultrastructural, criteria. A 2-month therapy with 1.25 mg of gestrinone daily induced a degree of cellular inactivation and degeneration of the endometriotic implants that was more pronounced than after 4 months of therapy with either gestrinone (2.5 mg twice or thrice weekly) or danazol (600 mg daily). There was no correlation between the morphologic response to treatment and either the hormonal response of the foci during the menstrual cycle before therapy or the change in laparoscopic staging of endometriosis at the end of therapy. It is suggested that a short-term medical treatment should be further evaluated clinically in the treatment of endometriosis and infertility."

CD009786,0,7889049,0,[Urologic applications of intralaparoscopic echography].,"The impossibility to palpate organs and tissues is probably the most important drawback of the laparoscopic approach: laparoscopic sonography represent the only real alternative to manual palpation. The laparoscopic approach in the field of urology was initially limited to the identification of the undescended testes in paediatric urology and to the laparoscopic ligation of varicocele. More recently, it took into account the pelvic lymphadenectomy for staging prostatic and bladder cancer. The upper urinary tract and the retroperitoneum were approached more recently. In a preliminary phase the indications for laparoscopic nephrectomy were limited to benign diseases, such as atrophic kidney in patients with renal hypertension, and scarred pyelonephritic kidney. At present some preliminary experiences are reported about nephrectomy performed for carcinoma of the urether or of the upper collecting system and for renal masses of unknown origin. Another indication for a laparoscopic approach to the kidney is represented by symptomatic renal cysts. These cysts have been usually treated with percutaneous aspiration and/or sclerosis, but a high rate of recurrence is reported. Laparoscopy may be used to approach renal cysts with the advantage that most of the cystic wall could be excised, reducing the change of recurrence. Another possible indication for laparoscopy and laparoscopic sonography is the retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in testes cancer with staging or therapeutic purposes. Nowadays preliminary experiences in laparoscopic adrenalectomy have been reported in a limited series of cases. In this report the Authors present their initial experience using a 7.5 MHz rigid probe having 400 crystal which can be inserted into a 10 mm trocar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009786,0,19525620,0,[Significance of laparoscopy in gynaecological oncology: limitations for adnexal tumours].,"In the last few decades, the impact and use of laparoscopy for benign adnexal tumours have markedly increased. However, the surgical resection of early-stage ovarian malignoma remains controversial. This review evaluates the importance of laparoscopy in surgery of adnexa and especially of malignant tumours. Certainly, morbidity after laparoscopy is lower, but there is a risk of possibly more restricted staging, rupture of the tumour and port metastases. Analysis showed that the standard treatment of ovarian malignant tumours is laparotomy via a vertical incision, because data on laparoscopy are scarce and prospective, randomized trials for early-stage ovarian cancer are still missing. Staging by laparoscopy is technically feasible, but so far there is no proof of safety."
CD009786,0,11499346,0,Prognostic factors in stage I ovarian carcinoma.,"Most studies on prognostic factors in stage I ovarian carcinoma have been hampered by a relative small number of patients included. In this study we identified the most important independent clinical and pathological prognostic factors in stage I epithelial invasive ovarian carcinoma in a large data base of 1545 patients with stage I epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The patients were treated in 6 different countries but were analysed in the same way. Because of the increasing use of endoscopy to remove possibly malignant cysts and the reports on rapid spread of ovarian carcinoma in the peritoneal cavity after laparoscopic removal of ovarian cancers, special attention was made to the presence and timing of the cysts before or during surgery. The multivariate analyses identified degree of differentiation as the most powerful prognostic indicator of disease-free survival, followed by rupture before surgery, rupture during surgery, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 1973 stage and age. When the effects of these factors were accounted for, none of the following were of prognostic value for disease-free survival: histological type, dense adhesions, extracapsular growth, ascites, FIGO stage 1988, and size of tumour. In conclusion, degree of differentiation was the most powerful prognostic indicator in Stage I ovarian cancer and should be used when deciding therapy in clinical practice. We also strongly advocate the inclusion of degree of differentiation in a new FIGO classification of stage I ovarian carcinoma. In addition, rupture before and during surgery, FIGO Stage 1973 (Ib versus Ia) and age were shown to be independent prognostic factors. Hence, every effort should be made to avoid rupture during primary surgery of malignant ovarian tumours confined to the ovaries."
CD009786,0,6454868,0,Laparoscopy for second-look evaluation in ovarian cancer.,"Although second-look laparotomy to ascertain primary therapeutic effect on ovarian cancer has been generally accepted, laparoscopy for this purpose has been controversial. Between 1974 and 1978, 119 consecutive laparoscopic examinations were performed on 57 patients with ovarian cancer to monitor the effect of chemotherapy or to determine disease status. Most procedures included intraperitoneal biopsy and cytologic evaluation of peritoneal washings. Seventy-three percent of the procedures were successful. Fourteen percent of the patients had major complications requiring laparotomy, most of which involved bowel perforation. Complications were significantly reduced when routine laparoscopy was preceded by needle laparoscopy. A negative laparoscopy including biopsy and cytologic evaluation was associated with a significant increase in survival when compared with the entire patient group. Repetitive laparoscopy permitted early detection of recurrence and identified patients whose risk of recurrence after 24 months was low. With each successive negative laparoscopy, the mean duration of remission was longer and the probability of recurrence lower."

Ultrasonography revealed a 7 × 4 cm solid right pelvic mass. There was no visible intrauterine gestational sac. The serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level was 11 998 IU/l. Emergency laparoscopy was performed for a presumptive diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. At laparoscopy, the right ovary was enlarged with a non-haemorrhagic 7 × 4 cm solid lesion, which was resected. The histological diagnosis was a dysgerminoma with immunohistochemistry showing nests of syncytiotrophoblastic cells, which were the origin of the hCG production. There was no pregnancy, either intrauterine or ectopic. There was no evidence of metastasis from the dysgerminoma on the positron-emission tomography scanner. The patient underwent a second procedure for surgical staging of this ovarian germ-cell tumour. This ovarian dysgerminoma was staged FIGO 1A, and the patient did not receive adjuvant therapy.

A 15-year-old girl presented with a giant (>25 cm) ovarian serous cyst adenoma containing 7 L of fluid. At open laparoscopy, a giant, entirely cystic, smooth mass originating from the right ovary and lying between the symphysis and the xiphoid was observed. After intraabdominal fluid aspiration, open conservative cystectomy was performed, avoiding spillage. The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged on the second postoperative day. To our knowledge, this is the largest ovarian cyst treated conservatively in an adolescent. Minimal access surgery, laparoscopy and open cystectomy, can be safely proposed in this group of patients. Conservative surgery should always be evaluated for preservation of ovarian function in cases of giant ovarian cysts in adolescents."

Recent data reinforced the arguments supporting the use of laparoscopy in the management of EOC. Advances in laparoscopy have enabled surgeons to meet the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics' criteria for staging of EOC. Although most study results are encouraging, the sample size is still too small to be able to draw definite conclusions. Frequently cited concerns such as accuracy of staging, intraabdominal tumor rupture and port site metastasis should not be used as arguments against laparoscopic management of EOC. Clinical evidence is clearly in favor of a larger role for laparoscopy in the management of EOC. This should encourage studies with larger sample sizes to confirm the validity of laparoscopic management of EOC."

The tissue samples were obtained after 2, 4, and 6 months of usage of the drug to study the ultrastructural effect of this treatment. The glandular epithelium appeared to be arrested in what looked like the late proliferative stage of the normal menstrual cycle. The ciliated cells remained unchanged for the most part. The findings were correlated with possible effects of danazol on the target tissue, but caution is required in the interpretation of ultrastructural effects of steroids until detailed knowledge of the metabolic pathways is available."
CD009786,0,17578369,0,Ectopic ovary: a case of autoamputated ovary with mature cystic teratoma into the cul-de-sac.,"An ovary with a mature cystic teratoma which was autoamputated into the cul-de-sac and confirmed by laparoscopy is described. A 24-year-old woman with a history of chronic pelvic pain for 5 years presented with left abdominal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left ovarian mass of 5 cm in diameter. The pain was relieved spontaneously after a few weeks. Laparoscopy was performed 5 months later. The mass was identified in the cul-de-sac partly enveloped in the omentum without any ligamentous or direct connection with the pelvic organs. There was no left ovary in its proper anatomical location. Histopathologic study revealed a mature cystic teratoma with viable ovarian tissue. These findings suggested autoamputation of the ovary either by inflammation or torsion, which is one of the mechanisms for the formation of an ectopic ovary."
CD009786,0,9050641,0,Laparoscopic techniques for extracting ovarian teratomas.,"We performed two techniques for laparoscopic extraction of benign ovarian teratomas. For cysts up to 5 cm, we used the pouch technique, with partial extraction followed by enlargement of the hypogastric port. A skin incision was enlarged to allow the use of a scalpel in the pouch. This enabled us to perform several stab incisions in the cyst to spill its contents while still holding it in the pouch. This was followed by suction irrigation and forceps removal of the contents until the collapsed cyst could be removed in the pouch. For a cyst over 5 cm, we performed endoscopic aspiration irrigation with hot water inside the cyst, followed by partial extraction of the cyst; an opening was made in the exposed cyst wall and the contents extracted as described. When the cyst wall collapsed, we proceeded with the final extraction. When spillage occurred, it was managed with extensive warm lavage of the peritoneum, skimming the floating debris with suction tubing until clear, and underwater inspection and removal of teeth and other solid material. With these techniques, we experienced no complications."

CD009786,0,15717442,0,Diagnosis and management of organic ovarian cysts: indications and procedures for laparoscopy.,"In the field of gynaecological surgery, the past few years have been significant due to the development of operative laparoscopy. Originally recommended for the diagnosis of female infertility, over the past 15 years laparoscopy has acquired the standing of a surgical discipline in its own right. Laparoscopic surgical treatment of ovarian cysts, whether conservative or radical, has now been completely standardized. The aim of this work is to specify the indications, procedures and risks involved with this surgery as applied to organic ovarian cysts. Only benign ovarian cysts are suitable for treatment by laparoscopic surgery; ovarian cancer must always be handled by classic surgery using a mid-line laparotomy. Given that clinical and other pre-operative investigations can give only an indication, ovarian lesions require surgical investigation to diagnose the histological type. Laparoscopy appears to be as reliable as laparotomy when assessing whether an ovarian tumour is malignant. The risk of parietal contamination and peritoneal dissemination if a malignancy is not recognized means that, if there are no signs of extra-ovarian extension, adnexectomy is mandatory whenever there is the slightest doubt. This adnexectomy must obey two important rules: it must be accomplished without rupturing the cyst, and the cyst must be placed, intact, inside an endoscopic bag before being extracted. Provided that all stages of the procedure, from pre-operative work-up to the initial diagnostic phase of the laparoscopy, are carried out meticulously, laparoscopic surgery is reliable for both the diagnosis and the management of benign organic-ovarian cysts."
CD009786,0,12013106,0,Peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking ovarian carcinoma with ascites and elevated serum CA-125: case report and review of literature.,"Peritoneal tuberculosis is rare in the western world, although its incidence has been increasing in recent years. The presenting signs and symptoms, imaging examinations and CA-125 status in peritoneal tuberculosis may resemble that of ovarian carcinoma. Thus, the possibility of peritoneal tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma, especially in women immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. A case of peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking ovarian carcinoma in a young woman immigrant from India is described. The patient presented with ascites, abdominopelvic masses and elevated serum CA-125 (1,081 U/ml). Laparoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis and no malignancy, and thereby unnecessary extended surgery was avoided. Following treatment with the 4-drug anti-tuberculosis regimen, the patient recovered with disappearance of ascites and abdominopelvic masses, and return of CA-125 to normal range. It is concluded that laparoscopy, if feasible, seems to be a sufficient and safe method to provide diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis."
CD009786,0,15717440,0,Modern surgical approaches to female reproductive tract.,"Laparoscopic and hysteroscopic surgery have changed the management of many gynaecological disorders. Procedures that previously required a long duration of hospitalization can now be done on an outpatient basis or with a short hospital stay. Surgical treatment remains the definitive and universal treatment of ectopic pregnancy and it can be safely done by laparoscopy. Most reproductive operations are done by laparoscopy and the results appear to be similar to those obtained with laparotomy. Those needing a laparotomy will be better treated by in-vitro fertilization. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is a viable alternative for infertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Most ovarian cysts and endometriosis should be treated by laparoscopy. Although uterine myomas can be removed by laparoscopy, the uterine integrity after the procedure is questionable. Surgery should be reserved for women who have completed their family or those with pedunculated or shallow intramural myomas. Alternatively, a laparoscopically assisted myomectomy can be done. For laparoscopic hysterectomies for benign lesions, supracervical hysterectomy appears to be a good option. Hysteroscopy has changed our management, particularly for abnormal uterine bleeding. A submucous myoma and polyp can be removed by hysteroscopy and, as an alternative to hysterectomy, endometrial ablation can be done. In the future, most procedures will be done by endoscopy and laparotomy will be reserved only for selected cases."

The actual treatment regimen consists of a cytoreductive surgery followed by a combination chemotherapy. Few studies have compared outcome of EPSPC to papillary serous ovarian cancer (PSOC). Several authors have documented similar clinical behavior between EPSPC and PSOC, but this finding has not been universal. A 64-year-old female patient with symptomatic gall stone disease underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Unexpectedly we found some uncommon small nodular structures on the serosa of the right colon. The histological findings suggested a poorly differentiated peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma. Biopsies of both ovaries showed no signs of tumor infiltration and the diagnosis of EPSPC was established. After surgery, a combination chemotherapeutic regimen with carboplatin and cyclophosphamid was given. Laparoscopic reassessment 7 months after the first procedure showed no tumor. 3 identical cycles completed chemotherapy.

Laparotomy is generally performed, even though this approach is regarded as highly invasive, whereas laparoscopy, though minimally invasive, is relatively contraindicated because of the high conversion rates to laparotomy. In light of this, we propose laparoscopically guided transverse minilaparotomy (LGTM) as a minimally invasive alternative technique.

Bevacizumab (BV) was started to administer with FOLFIRI since a CT scan had revealed that metastatic liver tumors had enlarged . Four days after final administration of BV (13th course), she presented lower abdominal pain. CT scan showed an enlarged right ovary sized 20 cm, but no findings suggesting bowel perforation; therefore we assumed her pain was due to enlarged ovarian tumor, which might be metastasis from sigmoid cancer. Increased oral morphine could not relieve her pain. Then, along with sufficient information about the risks of the operation caused by BV, we proposed an operation to remove her enlarged ovary. Day 16 after final administration of BV, we undertook a laparotomy by lower median incision, and found a twisted right adnex with large necrotic ovarian tumor. Pathologists diagnosed the ovarian tumor as primary ovarian cancer. No complication related to BV occurred, and she was moved to the ward for internal medicine 13 days after operation."

We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 127 operative ovarian lesions including 30 ovarian torsions (23.6%) treated in two pediatric centers over a 10-year period. Age at presentation, presenting symptoms, diagnostic studies, surgical procedure and pathological findings were analyzed. Mean age was 13.7 years. Conservative surgery has been performed in 46.7% of the cases and laparoscopic approach in 40%. Ovarian torsion occurred in 56.7% on ovaries with functional lesion, in 23.3% on normal adnexa and in 20% on ovaries with benign neoplasm. The article includes a literature review (2000-2010) and a statistical analysis which shows a slow increase in conservative surgery from 28 to 45%. Laparoscopic surgery accounts for 23.5%. Literature review shows 40.5% normal adnexa, 33.2% non-neoplastic lesions, 25.3% benign neoplasms and 1% malignant neoplasms. The surgical treatment of children and adolescents presenting adnexal torsion should be practiced as an emergency and it should be more conservative as possible in order to maximize the future reproductive potential."

CD009786,0,1593762,0,[Assessment of ovarian tumors by transvaginal scanning and clinical significance of ultrasonic examination in postoperative follow up].,"A hundred and sixty cases of ovarian tumor were preoperatively examined by transvaginal (TV) and Transabdominal (TA) scanning and accuracy of the assessment for histologic type was compared. We also examined 56 cases of postoperative ovarian cancer by ultrasonography to detect recurrent lesions. Positive predictive values for serous cysts and endometrial cysts were higher with TV than TA. Sensitivity for cancer was also high, but false negative rate was lower with TV than TA. The results showed that scatter from small particles and small mural echo in the cystic mass are visualized more clearly with TV, so that TV is more useful for assessing histological type of ovarian tumors. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonographic examination for detecting intraperitoneal recurrent lesions were 88.2% and 97.4%, respectively. Those for extraperitoneal lesions were 86.7% and 97.6%. Ultrasonography is suggested to be useful for detecting recurrence ovarian cancer especially for experitoneal lesions, as laparoscopy is not effective for such lesions."

CD009786,0,6504419,0,Chromosomal complements in primary gonadal failure.,"Twenty-nine patients underwent clinical, hormonal, endoscopic, and cytogenetic studies to determine the cause of primary amenorrhea or delayed sexual development. In 19 of them (mean age 17.6 years), the X chromosome was either missing or anomalous. In ten patients (mean age 25.5 years), the chromosomal complement was normal, 46 XX in six patients and 46 XY in four patients. Those with abnormal chromosomal complements were shorter (mean height, 141.9 cm) than patients with normal complements (158.7 cm). Somatic stigmas were observed more frequently in patients with chromosomally abnormal primary gonadal failure. In 23 patients (79.3%), the gonads were streaks, with fibrous stroma devoid of either follicles or tubules containing germ cells. In three patients the ovaries were hypoplastic, with few primordial follicles. Gonadoblastoma was present in two patients with XY and mixed XX/X/XY gonadal dysgenesis. In every patient with streak gonads and lack of germ cells, serum gonadotropin levels were elevated. Karyotype, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) assays, and eventually laparoscopy and gonadal biopsy are important in the management of patients with primary gonadal failure."

The disease is associated with a common clinical problem: persistent adnexal masses, most of which are benign. Operative laparoscopy has become an increasingly attractive way of diagnosing and removing adnexal masses. The practicing general gynecologist thus faces two new dilemmas: not to miss an early ovarian cancer or manage an unsuspected one to the patient's detriment, and not to perform extensive major surgery for adnexal masses, most of which can be handled laparoscopically. Fortunately, pertinent data exist on which the resolution of these dilemmas may be based."

They received escalating doses of intraperitoneally (IP) administered yttrium-90 (Y-90)-labeled monoclonal antibody, HMFG1, against a tumor cell-surface antigen. Myelosuppression prevented an escalation of the administered Y-90 activity above 25 mCi. Y-90-labeled antibody was absorbed from the peritoneal cavity into the circulation. Maximum blood Y-90 activity was observed 40 hours after the IP injection with a mean of 21% of the injected activity (range, 14.2% to 26.4%) in the circulation. The radiation dose the bone marrow received from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody (the blood radiation dose) was calculated by applying the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) formulation to the measured Y-90 activity in patients blood. Myelosuppression occurred following calculated blood radiation doses to bone marrow of only 10 to 30 cGy. The excessive myelosuppression following such modest radiation doses from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody could be explained by the uptake of Y-90 by bone. In an attempt to reduce bone absorption of Y-90, seven patients received an intravenous (IV) infusion of EDTA (Sinclair Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Godalming, United Kingdom). This increased the urinary excretion of Y-90 from a mean of 11.1% to 32.3% of the injected activity (P = .0001). Fourteen patients had assessable tumor at laparoscopy. Tumor regression was observed in one patient, and palliation of ascites in a further patient."
CD009786,0,18950959,0,"""Exterritorial"" lymphocytic hypophysitis within an ovarian teratoma during pregnancy: a possible sentinel lesion?","Pituitary tissue is rarely to be found among the constituents of ovarian teratomas (dermoid cysts). In some exceptional cases, however, such ectopic pituitary anlagen may even give rise to secondary organ-specific pathologies. Akin to those of the pituitary in its natural location, these tend to be adenomas. We describe a unique example of lymphocytic hypophysitis incidentally encountered in a mature left ovarian teratoma from a 30-year-old woman in the 19th week of pregnancy. Amidst various fully differentiated derivatives of all three embryonic layers, the cyst wall also included a miniature replica of the anterior pituitary lobe 0.5 cm in diameter. While a full set of adenohypophyseal hormone-producing cell types could be identified, there was characteristic pregnancy-related hyperplasia of lactotrophs. This was further overlaid by prominent mononuclear inflammation, including infiltration by T lymphocytes, follicular aggregates of B cells, and attendant destruction of parenchyma. There was no significant inflammatory reaction elsewhere. Discounting the non-standard location, the ensemble of the clinical setting and histology were felt to be indistinguishable from the classical paradigm of lymphocytic hypophysitis complicating pregnancy. To date, lymphocytic thyroiditis is the sole form of organ-specific inflammatory process within an ovarian teratoma on record. By analogy, we hypothesize that this ectopic manifestation of immune-mediated inflammation of pituitary parenchyma may possibly be read as a preclinical sentinel lesion of lymphocytic hypophysitis."

Blood kinetics and urinary excretion of the radiolabels were assayed. Scintigraphy was performed immediately following administration and before and after peritoneal lavage at 48 h. Blood levels of both preparations rose over the first 20-40 h reaching 8-14% of the administered dose in the circulation and then declined (T1/2 of 40 h). Circulating radiolabel was still attached partially to antibody as shown by precipitation with anti-mouse IgG antiserum. The rapid appearance of radiolabel in the bloodstream meant that any tumour localization could be from circulating antibody rather than local infiltration. Interpretation of the images was difficult and the distribution of the tracer was different from that previously observed using i.v. administration of antibody.

It is not possible to isolate sonographically the anatomically unchanged tube or the tube obliterated as a result of salpingitis. Nevertheless, it is possible to effect an indirect diagnosis if the tube is at least unilaterally patent or if it is bilaterally occluded, by means of an extended form of sonography within the scope of a sonographically controlled hydropertubation via a phenomenon which the author describes an ""positive"" or ""negative"" ""phenomenon of Douglas"". Hence, sonographically monitored hydropertubation, together with hysterosalpingography or laparoscopic chromopertubation--with reservations--is a valuable diagnostic tool to help in clarifying the cause of sterility. Pathological changes of the tubes in the sense of a sactosalpinx of different contents (retained secretions) can be differentiated by sonography.

One of these procedures included management of 2000 mL hemoperitoneum. Three of the 4 attempts at ovarian enucleation were successfully completed within 64 to 162 minutes, with estimated blood loss ≤ 50 mL. One NOTES procedure failed because of a misdiagnosed peritoneal mucinous tumor located anterior to the uterus and inaccessible, leading to subsequent conversion to transabdominal laparoscopy.

In advanced ovarian carcinoma, main objectives of salvage therapy include: a improvement in quality of life and symptoms; b. tumor load reduction and survival advantage; c. evaluation of potentially active new drugs to be included in first-line treatment. We need to evaluate the potential benefit on survival of systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy during primary or secondary cytoreductive surgery in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma. Paclitaxel/cisplatin is considered to be the international standard treatment based on the data of GOG 111 trial showing that paclitaxel/cisplatin has provided a survival benefit better than that of cyclophosphamide/cisplatin. This choice of standard therapy might, however, be questioned based on the results of the largest randomised study, ICON3. There were no statistically significant differences in progression-free or overall survival among paclitaxel/carboplatin and carboplatin only or a platinum combination (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/cisplatin). The best selection for adjuvant chemotherapy is still controversial and a large number of studies are now ongoing."

A ruptured appendiceal mucinous adenoma seems to be the most common origin, but low grade ovarian malignancies are often associated. Peritoneal gelatinous diseases must be subdivided into disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis, peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis and intermediate cases. These entities have significantly different prognosis. Debulking surgery is the most common treatment but some are in favour of an ultra radical surgery with hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy, with some encouraging results."
CD009786,0,19919915,0,[Advanced ovarian cancer: criteria of resectability].,"Residual disease is the first predictive factor for survival in women with ovarian cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy still has not proved superiority in terms of overall survival compared with complete initial resection. Hence, initial surgery remains the cornerstone of management for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Various parameters have been proposed to evaluate the ability of complete resection. Clinical evaluation of peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascite is not relevant enough while general status (ASA score) is correlated with the risk of postoperative complications. Preoperative dosage of CA-125 higher than 500 UI/L seems to be related with an increase risk of sub-optimal surgery. Recently, some authors challenged its prognostic value. For a CA-125 threshold at 500 UI/L, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values range from 58 to 78%, 64 to 89%, 64 to 84% and 35.7 to 85.4%, respectively. Imaging criteria failed to report concordant results. Indeed, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values vary from 52 to 100%, 75 to 100%, 49% to 100% and 50 to 100%, respectively. High-correlation has been demonstrated for carcinomatosis scores evaluating the dissemination of the disease (AUCs of ROCs curves higher than 0.6). At laparotomy, for an Eisenkop score under 6, 99% of patients could benefit of complete resection. At laparoscopy, for a Fagotti score under 4, a complete cytoreduction could be obtained in 78% of patients. This score had the best AUC (0.76). Various scoring systems are available for surgeons to evaluate the resecability of advanced ovarian cancer. Among them, peroperative scoring systems appear the best tool and should be recommended in routine especially at first laparoscopy. Finally, due to the impact on survival of complete initial resection, women with advanced ovarian cancer should be referred to specialized centres."
CD009786,0,11834867,0,Influence of pelvic endometriosis and ovarian endometrioma on fertility.,"We investigated the influence of pelvic endometriosis and ovarian endometrioma on pregnancy outcome in women associated with infertility. A total of 237 women with endometriosis were reviewed, and their fertility rate was assessed by both r-AFS staging and TOP classification as previously proposed by our group. There was no significant difference in pregnancy rate among r-AFS stages. However, the pregnancy rate was mostly affected by the tubal condition according to the TOP classification as follows: no adhesive lesion (T0), 53% (69/129); unilateral lesion (T1), 46% (18/39); bilateral lesion with at least one tube patent, (T2), 37% (10/27); bilateral tubal occlusion (T3), 0% (0/8) (p < 0.05, Mantel-Extension test). The absence (O0-O1) or co-existence (O2-O3) of ovarian endometrioma and different gradings of cul-de-sac obliteration (P2-P3) showed no significant differences in pregnancy rate. The resulting conception rate was also not affected by the size or location of ovarian endometrioma. In addition, the higher adhesion score of ovarian endometrioma involving the fallopian tube and as described in r-AFS classification had a significant detrimental effect on fertility. These observations suggest that our TOP classification describing individual tubal condition has a clinically predictive value in assessing the reproductive outcome of women with endometriosis."

Data collected included operative time, estimated blood loss, lymph node count, time for the recovery of normal temperature and time to resumption of normal bladder function, intraoperative and postoperative complications. The procedure was completed laparoscopically in 108 patients. Two patients were converted to laparotomy due to common iliac vein injury. The mean overall operative time was 200.6+/-38.6 min; the mean operative blood loss was 280.5+/-128.3 mL; he mean number of pelvic lymph nodes that were resected wa26. 0+/-5.8. The time for recovery of normal temperature and the normal bladder function after the operation was 5.8+/-2.9 d and 15.2+/-4.3 d.

One case has been diagnosed with cervical squamous cell carcinoma, whereas the others have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumor. We present a novel case of laparoscopy-site abdominal wall metastasis from endometrial cancer after laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). The 56-year-old female patient exhibited metastases of an abdominal wall trocar site and a perineal site after undergoing LAVH and laparoscopic-assisted (LA) bilateral pelvic lymph node sampling as well as LA para-aortic lymph node sampling for treating endometrial carcinoma, surgical staging IIIC, G3. The interval between the surgical extirpation of endometrial carcinoma and diagnosis of the tumor recurrence was 6 months, suggesting that overmanipulation of the diseased organ during laparoscopic surgery may have resulted in tumor spillage, intraperitoneal dissemination, and wound contamination. Although this procedure has been proven beneficial to patients with benign disease or early-stage gynecologic malignancies, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy may not be efficacious to eradicate advanced gynecological malignancy."

CD009786,0,18802903,0,Dermoid tumors of the ovary: evaluation of the gasless lift-laparoscopic approach.,"Laparoscopic removal is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for dermoid tumors. However, the spillage of dermoid content with the laparoscopic approach is very high compared to laparotomy. The potential malignancy of dermoid tumors and the rare, but difficult to treat, chemical peritonitis in cases of spillage of dermoid content should lead to an adaptation of procedures during an endoscopic operation on a dermoid tumor to comply with the precautions of the ""open"" technique. Lift-laparoscopy combines laparoscopy with the standard procedures of laparotomy and thus may help reduce the spillage of dermoid contents. In a retrospective study of 108 patients with dermoid tumors, the frequency of the rupture of a dermoid tumor during a lift-laparoscopic operation was examined. Among the 79 cases of organ-preserving treatment, there were only three cases (3.8%) where a rupture of the dermoid capsule occurred. Even in cases of ruptures, it was possible to avoid spillage by closing the lesion with a clamp and continue the enucleation of the dermoid tumor during a lift-laparascopic operation. After thorough abdominal cavity lavage, none of these three cases showed a cytological contamination of the abdominal cavity with dermoid cells. None of the ovariectomy or adnexectomy cases showed a rupture. Histologically, there was also no carcinoma in any of the examined dermoid tumors. By adapting the endoscopic dermoid surgery to the precautions established in an open surgery technique using gasless lift-laparoscopy, ruptures and cell spilling can be avoided to a large extent but not completely excluded. Compared with other methods, the number of ruptures and spillage of dermoids by organ-preserving treatment as well as ovariectomy is lowest using a lift-laparoscopic procedure."

CD009786,0,8059620,0,Ovarian cysts: a clinical dilemma.,"The rapid development of ultrasound technology and its routine application during gynecological examinations has led to the more frequent detection of ovarian cysts. Such cysts can be diagnosed at any age or stage of a woman's life, and detected as early as the fetal stage or as late as the postmenopause. Ovarian cysts in female fetuses are usually detected during screening in pregnancy and followed after delivery as neonates. A few months are usually sufficient for spontaneous regression, although symptomatic cysts should be promptly operated. In fertile women, most cases present benign functional cysts which disappear after menstruation or can be managed easily with the combined oral contraceptive pill. When pregnancy is complicated with an adnexal mass, the second trimester is the preferable time of action in cases when operation is demanded. Transvaginal sonography plays an important role, not only in the detection of ovarian cysts but also in the diagnosis of malignancy. Large cysts, multiloculi, septa, papillae and increased blood flow are all suspected signs of neoplasia. The incidence of ovarian cancer increases with age and is predominantly a disease of peri- and postmenopausal women with an average patient age of 50-59 years. Vaginal sonography has been established as the examination of choice in screening and follow-up of patients, with complementary color Doppler studies and determination of serial serum levels of CA-125. If a malignant cyst is suspected, at any age, explorative laparotomy should be performed promptly. Sonographic or computerized tomographic scanner aspiration procedures, as well as laparoscopic surgery, should be reserved for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in low-risk cancer patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009786,0,20198556,0,Leydig-cell-tumor of the ovary that responded to GnRH-analogue administration - case report and review of the literature.,"Progressive hirsutism can be a symptom of an androgen-producing tumor, especially in postmenopausal women. We report a case of a 58-year-old woman who complained of progressive hirsutism, nervousness, irritability, anxiousness and an increased libido. Examination showed an unusual redness of her head, décolleté, palms and soles of her feet. Basal laboratory tests revealed a profound elevation of testosterone levels (7.5 microg/l) and normal levels of androstendione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, 17alpha-hydroxy-progesterone and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Also remarkable was that her red blood count, hemoglobin and hematocrit values were elevated while erythropoietin was within normal limits. Functional laboratory tests ruled out heterozygous C21-hydroxylase deficiency and showed a moderate insulin resistance on the oral glucose tolerance test. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a slightly hyperdensic area of 6 mm in the left ovary. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a contrast medium-accumulating area of 2 cm in the left ovary. Since the patient was initially reluctant to undergo surgery, a GnRH-analogue (triptoreline) was administered VIA intramuscular injection once per month for two months and testosterone levels were lowered to less than one third of the initial level (2 microg/l). Surgery was eventually performed with laparoscopic bilateral salpingoophorectomy, hysteroscopy and uterine curettage. The histologic examination revealed a Leydig cell tumor in the hilus and stroma of the left ovary. Postoperatively testosterone levels dropped dramatically and instantly into the normal range. Within months, the red blood count and hematocrit levels were within normal limits. The patient's face became more feminine, the redness of her face and hirsutism regressed. Her anxiousness and nervosity resolved and the insulin sensitivity improved. In this paper, polyglobulia, the metabolic and psychological changes due to hyperandrogenism are discussed, as well as the phenomenon that the tumor responded to a GnRH-analogue. Such a response implies that the tumor is either under gonadotropin control or that GnRH analogues have direct effects via receptors on tumorous Leydig cells."

Operative laparoscopy has been described in the surgical staging and treatment of patients with ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. it seems to be a very promising approach with the potential to revolutionize numerous aspects of the management of gynecologic malignancies. Since 1996, the SGO has offered an operative laparoscopy course to all gynecologic oncology fellowship programs. Boike and colleagues report that faculty and fellows from 25 different fellowship programs have attended the 2-day course. In questionnaires filled out at the completion of the course, more than 85% of respondents believed that operative laparoscopic procedures were equivalent to open techniques and should be taught in fellowship programs. Despite the enthusiasm for the use of endoscopy in patients with gynecologic malignancies, its potential is unconfirmed and its hazards unknown. Reports regarding complications and long-term results are just now beginning to be published. More clinical data must be collected before the minimally invasive techniques can be accepted as new surgical standards. Ongoing prospective clinical trials will help to answer many of the questions regarding safety and efficacy. Pending the completion of additional trials, operative laparoscopy will remain a promising but unproven tool in the management of patients with gynecologic cancer."

According to risk factors on pathologic evaluation of the specimen, some of them will receive postoperative pelvic radiotherapy. This subset of patients could benefit from taking the ovaries away from the irradiation field in an effort to preserve their functionality. This prospective study included 28 FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer patients, 45 years old or younger, maintaining menstrual cycles, who were considered suitable for conservation of the ovaries. The ovarian transposition was performed by laparoscopy as a part of the same celio-Schauta operation. Twelve patients underwent adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy. No intraoperative or postoperative morbidity related to the ovarian transposition was observed, and the procedure only entailed a minimum delay of the operative time. There were no cases of ovarian metastasis. At a mean follow-up of 44 months, 63.6% of patients receiving radiotherapy and 93% of those who nonirradiated maintained normal ovarian function. Two patients developed benign ovarian cysts, requiring oophorectomy, but no other long-term adverse effects of the transposition were identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series of the laparoscopic procedure reported to date in this setting. According to our results, laparoscopic ovarian transposition is a safe and effective procedure for the preservation of ovarian function in young patients with early cervical cancer undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery."

CD009786,0,21566518,0,Lymph node counts in endometrial cancer: expectations versus reality.,"It has been proposed that an adequate lymph node (LN) dissection in cases of endometrial carcinoma (CA) should contain a determined number of pelvic (P) and/or para-aortic (PA) LNs. As a result, our surgeons have certain expectations regarding the number of PLNs and PALNs reported per case. Failure to meet these expectations has become a challenge in our practice. In an attempt to solve this problem, we wanted to ascertain whether a pathology factor such as disregarding small LNs not detected on gross examination was responsible for any discrepancy between expected and reported LN counts. To achieve this goal, we evaluated the impact of the microscopic examination of residual adipose tissue (AT) after the routine processing of LN dissections performed as part of the staging procedure for patients with endometrial CA (endometrioid, serous, and clear cell CA) on the LN counts and status for hysterectomies performed from 2006 to the present. In addition, we assessed whether other factors such as surgical procedure type, operating surgeon, histologic subtype of CA, depth of myometrial invasion, or body mass index had an impact on the number of LNs obtained. The number of PLNs and PALNs were recorded. All LN specimens were processed by dissecting LNs from the surrounding AT. The number of LNs submitted per cassette was recorded in the section code. In cases in which residual AT was submitted, hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of the additional tissue were reviewed to determine the number and size of any additional LNs and their status. Two hundred fifty-eight patients had a median of 11 PLNs (range, 1 to 38) and 6 PALNs (range, 1 to 25). Fifty of 78 cases (64%) in which residual AT was submitted had additional LNs (median size, 4.0 mm): median 2 PLNs and 3 PALNs. There was no significant association between the number of LNs obtained and whether the residual AT was submitted (PLN, P=0.2; PALN, P=0.78). There were no cases in which metastatic endometrial CA was present exclusively in the additional LNs. Compared with open hysterectomy, laparoscopically and robotically obtained lymphadenectomy specimens had an average of 3 and 0.8 more PALNs, respectively (P=0.002). No similar association was found for PLNs or total LNs. Evidence for some difference in LN counts between surgeons was observed. No evidence of an association between body mass index, histologic subtype of endometrial CA or depth of myometrial invasion and LN count was identified. In our experience, the standard processing of lymphadenectomy specimens adequately reflects the actual numbers of LNs obtained in cases of endometrial CA. Submitting the residual AT does not increase the number of reported LNs or the detection of positive LNs. Additional studies are required to determine the actual numbers of PLNs and PALNs present and to determine whether a revision of the number of LNs required to consider a lymphadenectomy as adequate is necessary."

PID primarily affects young, sexually active women, and it is highly correlated with having several sexual partners, intrauterine contraceptive device and sexually transmitted diseases. The spectrum of disease is caused most commonly by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 30-50% of cases. PID is responsible for severe acute morbidity and significant long-term sequelae, including tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The following clinical features are suggestive of a diagnosis of PID: bilateral lower abdominal tenderness, abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge, fever (higher than 38 degrees C), abnormal vaginal bleeding, dyspareunia, cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness, with or without a palpable mass. In laboratory findings, there is presence of excess leucocytes, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. Transvaginal ultrasound scanning may be helpful, and its sensitivity is up to 85%. It can identify inflamed and dilated tubes and tubo-ovarian masses. Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in a final diagnosis in 95% of cases. In 15-30% of suspected cases, there is no laparoscopic evidence of disease.

CD009786,0,18447057,0,[Endoscopic management of gynecological malignancies: an update. 2007].,"All the different surgical procedures used to treat gynecologic cancers have already been performed with the endoscopic approach. However, the prospective randomized trials required to confirm the oncologic efficacy of this approach are still lacking in gynecology, whereas such studies are available for abdominal surgery. Animal studies suggest that the risk of tumor dissemination in the non traumatized peritoneum may be higher after pneumoperitoneum than after laparotomy, and they also show the importance of the surgeon's experience and technique. All the parameters of pneumoperitoneum can influence the risk of postoperative dissemination. By controlling these parameters we may, in future, be able to create a peritoneal environment suitable for oncologic indications and thereby prevent or minimize the risk of peritoneal dissemination and postoperative tumor growth. In endometrial cancer, the laparoscopic approach should be reserved for clinical stage I disease, if the volume of the uterus and local conditions are appropriate for vaginal extraction. In cervical cancer, the laparoscopic approach should be reserved for patients with favorable prognostic factors (stage IB, less than 2 cm in diameter). Laparoscopy is the gold standard for surgical diagnosis of adnexal masses, but puncture should be avoided whenever possible. Surgical treatment of invasive ovarian cancer should use laparotomy, whatever the stage. In contrast, restaging of early ovarian cancer initially managed as a benign mass is a good indication for the laparoscopic approach. Laparoscopic management of tumors with low malignant potential should include complete staging of the peritoneum. An excellent knowledge of the principles of endoscopy and of oncologic surgery is required. Training in endoscopic oncological techniques will be a major challenge in the field of gynecologic surgery in coming years."

CD009786,0,15285533,0,Role of surgery in ovarian cancer: an update.,"Rupture of an ovarian malignant tumor should be avoided at the time of surgery for an early ovarian cancer. Laparoscopic removal of ovarian cysts should be restricted to patients with preoperative evidence that the cyst is benign. Degree of differentiation is the most important independent prognostic factor in stage I disease and should be used in decisions on therapy in clinical practice and the future FIGO-classification of Stage I. In early ovarian cancer staging adequacy and tumor grade were the only 2 statistical significant prognostic factors for survival in the multivariate analysis of the EORTC ACTION-trial. According to the present data there is no scientific basis to rely only on adjuvant chemotherapy or on optimal staging procedure in medium and high risk stage I ovarian cancer. Primary debulking surgery by a gynecologic oncologist remains the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer. Optimal debulking surgery should be defined as no residual tumor load. Interval debulking is defined as an operation performed after a short course of induction chemotherapy, usually 2 or 3 cycles. Based on the randomized EORTC-GCG trial, interval debulking by an experienced surgeon improves survival in some patients who did not undergo optimal primary debulking surgery. Based on the GOG 152 data, interval debulking surgery does not seem to be indicated in patients who underwent primarily a maximal surgical effort by a gynecological oncologist. Open laparoscopy is probably the most valuable tool for evaluating the operability primarily or at the time of interval debulking surgery. In retrospective analyses neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery does not seem to worsen prognosis compared to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, we will have to wait for the results of the EORTC-GCG/NCI Canada randomized trial to know whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is as good as primary debulking surgery in some or all stage IIIc and IV patients. The most suitable candidates for secondary debulking surgery are those who had an initial complete response to chemotherapy, a long treatment-free interval (e.g. more than 12 months), and resectable disease (without diffuse carcinomatosis)."

Adopting this technique in cases of suspect adnexal masses enables the reduction of spilling and ensures an intact specimen. Twenty-two consecutive patients with suspect adnexal masses 10 cm or smaller underwent laparoscopic adnexectomy. Patients with bilateral suspect ovarian masses that required bilateral adnexectomy were enrolled only if they were no longer of childbearing age. Laparoscopy was feasible in all patients. No tumor spillage occurred. In 5 patients (23.6%), minilaparotomy was required to extract the specimen. Mean (SD) operating time was 80 (35-160) minutes, and estimated blood loss was 50 (10-100) mL. No major intraoperative complications occurred. Median (range) postoperative stay was 1 (1-3) day. Definitive pathologic analysis revealed benign pathologic conditions in 18 patients (81.8%), an ovarian tumor with low malignant potential in 3 patients (13.7%), and ovarian cancer in 1 patient (4.5%) in whom findings at frozen-section analysis were inconclusive. Median (range) follow-up of malignant ovarian tumors and of tumors with low malignant potential was 27 (21-29) months. No recurrence or port-site metastasis developed during follow-up.

Of the 42 women undergoing a cystectomy, the clinical diagnosis of an endometrioma was confirmed by pathology in only 68%, the other cases being corpora lutea (27%) or follicular cysts (5%). Cyst fluids from corpora lutea had lower CA 125 concentrations (< 1000 IU/ml) together with high 17 beta-oestradiol concentrations (> 2000 pg/ml) and/or high progesterone concentrations (> 100 ng/ml). Endometriotic cysts had either very high CA 125 concentrations (> 10,000 IU/ml) as occurred in 78% or lower CA 125 concentrations (< 1000 IU/ml) together with low 17 beta-oestradiol and/or progesterone concentrations. 'Chocolate' fluid-containing cysts aspirated during IVF had similar concentration profiles of CA 125, 17 beta-oestradiol and progesterone and the diagnoses derived from these concentrations were not contradicted in 19/27 women undergoing a laparoscopy within 4 months. In eight women, however, with high CA 125 concentrations in their cyst fluid, no endometriotic cysts were found at laparoscopy.

Laparoscopy is also used in patients undergoing second-look procedures and to help evaluate whether patients should undergo optimal tumor debulking procedures or be initially managed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Randomized clinical studies are needed to further support the role of minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of ovarian cancer."
CD009786,0,2141643,0,Laparoscopic management of stage I ovarian cancer. A case report.,"A woman with stage I ovarian cancer refused traditional treatment and was managed laparoscopically. Both ovaries were removed intact via a culdotomy incision. Vaginal hysterectomy, omentectomy and laparoscopic lymphadenectomy followed. With the increasing frequency of laparoscopic oophorectomy, it clearly seems prudent to remove ovaries intact through the cul-de-sac whenever ovarian pathology is in doubt. Although the laparoscopic approach is as yet unproven, it is an alternative for a select group of well-informed women with borderline or low-grade ovarian malignancy."

The operations varied from simple pelviscopic lysis of adhesions to bilateral oophorectomy; 18 patients had the latter. A protocol involving CA-125 and ultrasound was introduced to decrease the risk of affecting the prognosis of potentially malignant ovarian tumors. A technique was developed that may answer possible criticisms of the endoscopic approach to surgery in women who are past childbearing."

The indications for laparoscopy were infertility (16) and dysmenorrhea (14). The laparoscopic procedures undertaken so far at our clinic were aspiration of chocolate cysts, removal of ovarian endometriomas, adnexal adhesiolysis, uterine nerve ablation, coagulation of peritoneal endometriosis and irrigation. No complications occurred. After undergoing this procedure, 6 of 16 patients achieved pregnancy, and 13 of 14 obtained pain relief. The serum CA-125 levels were significantly decreased postoperatively. We confirmed that contact irradiation with a cone-shaped sapphire probe provides an adequate incision and lysis at low power levels and that this method is an effective treatment for ovarian endometriomas."
CD009786,0,10806907,0,[Controversies in surgical treatment of advanced ovarian cancer].,"Cytoreductive surgery has traditionally been regarded as a cornerstone in the primary treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Both five year survival and median survival are better for patients with small residual masses. Despite many similar reports showing the prognostic significance of postoperative residual tumour, the survival benefits of cytoreductive surgery still remain scientifically unproven and controversial. There have been no prospective controlled clinical trials. The question remains as to whether the observed survival benefits for patients subjected to primary cytoreductive surgery are an effect of surgery skills or tumour biology. The proponents of tumour biology claim that cytoreductive surgery is a selective procedure and that patients with better prognosis are selected. Therefore a randomized study between primary cytoreduction and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients that cannot be optimally cytoreduced seems warranted, though one problem with such a study is how to select eligible patients. During chemotherapy and after relapse several types of operations are used in ovarian cancer: secondary cytoreductive surgery, interval cytoreductive surgery, second-look surgery and palliative secondary surgery. So far interval cytoreductive surgery during chemotherapy is the only type of operation which in a prospective randomized study showed significant improvement in long-term survival. This paper discusses indirect evidence in the literature in support of or in contradiction to the primary debulking hypotheses and also indications and impact of surgical procedures during chemotherapy."

The adrenal glands and the ovaries were normal on radiological and ultrasonographic investigation. Catheterization of the veins draining from the adrenal glands and the ovaries yielded testosterone levels of 20.3 nmol/L and 20.0 nmol/L in the right and the left adrenal veins, respectively, and 17.9 nmol/L and 27.4 nmol/L in the right and left ovaries venous plexus, respectively. Sequencial dexamethasone and ethynyl estradiol suppression test showed a decrease in cortisol level with no change in total testosterone level on dexamethasone while an increase in testosterone from 10.5 nmol/L to 20.1 nmol/L was observed ten days after ethynil estradiol had been associated to dexamethasone. When a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (gonadorelin 3.5 mg i.m.) was administered for 2 months, serum gonadotropins levels decreased to less than 2 IU/L, total testosterone to 3.8 nmol/L and estradiol to less than 36 pmol/L. The patient was submitted to a pelvic exploratory laparotomy and a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. A solid and circumscribed ovarian tumor of 1.0 cm in diameter was found. The pathological diagnosis was a Leydig cell tumor with surrounding stromal hyperplasia. These findings may suggest that this tumor was gonadotropin-dependent being indirectly stimulated by ethynil estradiol, through a sensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes and increase in gonadotropin levels and suppressed by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist."

Forty-nine patients were classified as having new disease or were to have reassessment of disease, and seven cases were to be restaged (one with and six without clinical evidence of disease). Of new and reassessment cases, 44 patients underwent lymphography, 16 underwent peritoneoscopy with diaphragmatic inspection and 30 had peritoneal cytologic testing performed. Positive lymphography resulted in restaging in 31.6% of patients. Diaphragmatic inspection was always negative. Peritoneal cytologic testing was positive for malignant cells in three patients and worsened the stage in one. Pathologic staging of disease was as follows: Stage IA, 24; Stage IB, one Stage IC, one; Stage III peritoneal disease, two. Stage III retroperitoneal disease, 12; Stage III peritoneal and retroperitoneal disease; four. The 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 91% in patients with pathologic Stages IA, IB, and IC; 74% in those with Stage III retroperitoneal disease, and 24% in patients with Stage III peritoneal disease or peritoneal plus retroperitoneal disease.

No more than 130 cases are reported. Several risk factors such as chronic peritoneal irritation, caused by foreign bodies, infection or endometriosis, were hypothesized but the pathogenesis is still unknown. A 51-year menopausal woman was submitted to ultrasonography because of abnormal uterine bleeding. The scan revealed a right ovarian cyst (size 81 x 64 mm) with the feature of serous cyst. In the anamnesis a cystectomy of the right ovary and appendectomy were reported. At laparoscopy, then converted in laparotomy, a cyst arising from peritoneum of the posterior surface of the uterus was found. The right ovary was normal. The histopathological finding was: serous simple cyst of peritoneum. Ultrasonographic diagnosis was not confirmed by surgery; in fact, sometimes, it may be difficult to establish the origin of pelvic cystic mass, from ovary or peritoneum, by ultrasonography. It is mandatory to suggest a laparoscopy and/or laparotomy in case of pelvic cystic mass that does not regress in the time even after administration of oral contraceptives."
CD009786,0,18971141,0,Occult fallopian tube cancer in a patient with BRCA1 breast cancer.,"Primary fallopian tube cancer is very rare form of ovarian cancer. However, despite the infrequent incidence, emerging evidence suggests that patients who have a deleterious mutation of BRCA1 or -2 mutation may be more vulnerable to developing this disease. A patient with breast carcinoma was initially treated for her disease in 1994. She had a new primary lesion on the contralateral side in 2001 and was eventually identified with a positive BRCA1 germline mutation in 2007. The patient subsequently underwent a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy surgery performed by her gynecologist. Final pathology revealed occult stage IIC fallopian tube cancer with bilateral ovarian serosal involvement. Consequently, the patient was referred to gynecologic oncology and underwent a pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopic omentectomy, followed by chemotherapy. Although fallopian tube cancer is rare, women who are positive for the BRCA mutation are at greater risk for developing this disease. Therefore, physicians should consider the associated risk factors and perform comprehensive risk-reducing surgery and staging when treating these patients."
CD009786,0,20079589,0,Laparoscopic surgery for gynaecological cancers in obese women.,"The use of laparoscopic surgery in the management of gynaecological malignancies has been growing for over a decade. Concomitantly the incidence of obesity has been increasing worldwide. This review summarizes the available studies on minimal invasive surgery in obese women with gynaecological malignancies. We undertook a literature search to identify the differences between traditional open methods and the laparoscopic approach in terms of intra- and postoperative outcome and patient safety. Only eight relevant studies were identified. Six of these focused on endometrial cancer, one study included early stage cervical and ovarian cancers with other benign conditions, while another paper included cervical and endometrial pre-cancers and only a few malignant conditions. Obesity is generally known to increase the risk of intra- and postoperative complications. However, several studies show that obesity, formerly precluding keyhole surgery, seems now to be an indication for the laparoscopic approach. As compared to laparotomy, laparoscopic surgery has a good postoperative outcome, reduced estimated blood loss (EBL) and pain and in some series an increased lymph node count. Laparoscopy has been shown to be cost effective with a shorter hospital stay and return to normal activity. Survival is reported to be the same with both laparotomy and laparoscopy. The benefits of minimal invasive surgery in gynaecological surgery are starting to be found with robotic surgery."

CD009786,0,11091991,0,Female sterilization. Evidence.,"The literature review herein reveals substantial information regarding the safety, efficacy, short-term complications, long-term complications, and noncontraceptive benefits of sterilization. This information should be helpful for providers and potential sterilization candidates. The review also reveals areas where the data are unclear. Points to keep in mind during counseling include the following: The vast majority of women are satisfied with the decision to undergo sterilization. The fact that regret occurs underscores the importance of counseling and adequate individual deliberation before the procedure. In addition to the difficulty and expense associated with sterilization reversal, the woman should thoroughly understand the permanence of the procedure. Although failure is a rare event, it can occur many years after the procedure. Although evidence suggests that hysterectomy rates are higher in sterilized women aged less than 30 to 35 years, it is unlikely that there is a plausible biologic effect of sterilization on hysterectomy risk. An association between tubal sterilization and menstrual cycle changes does not seem valid for changes noted up to 2 years after the procedure. Data are unclear and inconsistent among studies observing women more than 2 years after the procedure. Evidence consistently shows that sterilization is associated with a reduced incidence of ovarian cancer and pelvic inflammatory diseases. Most studies show no effect or improvement of sexual satisfaction after sterilization. Complications during and postprocedure are rare. Sterilization provides no protection against the acquisition of sexually transmitted disease. Patients and their physicians should recognize that sterilized women may need more targeted preventive efforts for health screening and to reduce high-risk behavior than women who use other contraceptive methods. The surgeon's experience and the woman's preferences should govern the ultimate decision regarding the approach and occlusion method. Level II-2 evidence indicates comparable safety between interval laparoscopy and minilaparotomy. Data consistently show that in experienced trained hands, tubal sterilization is safe and highly effective regardless of the approach or occlusive method. Attention to the subtleties of technique seems to be most important in ensuring procedure safety and efficacy. Reanalysis of the CREST data shows that the cumulative failure rate of bipolar coagulation is comparable with the failure rate of unipolar coagulation if a substantial length of tube is adequately coagulated. The data discussed herein can be used to guide management decisions that may increase accessibility and reduce cost of the procedure. Low-resource settings and office settings have maintained an excellent safety record for this procedure through performance of sterilization under local anesthesia. The use of local anesthesia enables a change in procedure location from an inpatient operating room to a free-standing surgical clinic or adequately equipped office. Local anesthesia, with or without preoperative medication, is an excellent option associated with a lower complication risk, reduced cost, and shorter, easier recovery. The surgeon should have specific training in the effective use of local anesthetics, preoperative medications, and management of rare complications in low-resource settings. Little additional research is needed regarding the safety and efficacy of standard sterilization approaches and occlusion methods. There is a need for continued development of nonsurgical methods of sterilization, microlaparoscopic approaches performed in the office setting, and the feasibility and acceptance of service provision by nonspecialist health care providers. The evidence indicates that female sterilization can be performed safely in a variety of resource settings ranging from rural sterilization camps in developing countries to high-tech, resource-rich operating rooms in developed c"

Pathologically, it is the result of functional endometrium located outside the uterus. It may vary from microscopic endometriotic implants to large cysts (endometriomas). The physical manifestations are protean, with some patients being asymptomatic and others having disabling pelvic pain, infertility, or adnexal masses. Symptoms do not necessarily correlate with the severity of the disease. Ultrasonographic (US) features are variable and can mimic those of other benign and malignant ovarian lesions. Low-level internal echoes and echogenic wall foci are more specific US features for endometriomas. Magnetic resonance imaging improves diagnostic accuracy, with endometriotic cysts typically appearing with high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and demonstrating ""shading"" on T2-weighted images. The ovaries are the most common sites affected, but endometriosis can also involve the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, chest, and soft tissues. Small implants and adhesions are not well evaluated radiologically; therefore, laparoscopy remains the standard of reference for diagnosis and staging. Both medical and surgical treatment options are available depending on the patient's specific case."

Lymph node biopsy revealed metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma with focal signet ring cell differentiation. Imaging studies demonstrated metastatic disease without a defined primary site. Acute renal and respiratory failure developed and the patient expired shortly after initiation of chemotherapy, 7 weeks after presentation. Autopsy examination revealed widespread metastatic adenocarcinoma with a 2 cm cervical adenocarcinoma. The second patient, age 43, presented with left internal jugular vein thrombosis, acute thrombophlebitis, and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. She developed progressive venous thrombosis despite anticoagulation. Imaging studies demonstrated widespread lymphadenopathy and an adnexal mass. Diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsies and left oophorectomy revealed metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell differentiation involving peritoneum, ovary, cervix, and bladder without a defined primary site. Progressive thromboembolic disease with acute renal failure and multiple cerebral infarcts developed and the patient expired shortly after initiation of chemotherapy, 2 months after presentation. No autopsy was performed. HPV DNA was detected by in situ hybridization in the lymph node metastasis in the first case and in the cervical and ovarian tumor specimens in the second case. High-risk HPV-related endocervical adenocarcinomas occasionally exhibit signet ring cell differentiation and can present with Trousseau syndrome. These features more commonly suggest metastatic adenocarcinoma of upper gastrointestinal tract origin but the presence of HPV DNA within the tumors establishes them as cervical in origin."

The laparoscopic management of adnexal masses remains controversial because of the potential risks of cancer dissemination suggested by many case reports and national surveys. Experimental data show potential advantages and disadvantages for the laparoscopic treatment of gynecologic cancer. Since the risk of dissemination appears high when a large number of malignant cells are present, adnexal tumors with external growths and bulky lymph nodes may be considered contra-indications to CO(2) laparoscopy. Surgical diagnosis is the key to adequate management of adnexal masses. In our experience, laparoscopic diagnosis of malignancy is reliable after a careful pre-operative evaluation has been performed. Moreover, national surveys have revealed that despite suspicious laparoscopic findings, many malignant masses were considered benign at the outset. Using strict guidelines, laparoscopic diagnosis can be proposed for both non-suspicious and complex masses, thus avoiding many unnecessary laparotomies for benign masses suspicious at ultrasound. The more controversial limits of laparoscopic treatment are discussed. If a laparotomy was performed for all masses suspicious at surgery, 80% of the cases would be treated by laparoscopy. The role of laparoscopy for restaging and second-look operations for ovarian cancer requires further evaluation."
CD009786,0,10883022,0,Surgical staging of early invasive epithelial ovarian tumors.,"Early stage epithelial ovarian carcinoma is defined pathologically as a tumor strictly limited to one or both ovaries without any extra-ovarian disease (i.e., Stage IA or B of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification). This diagnosis can be obtained only after an exhaustive surgical staging procedure, performed as soon as the diagnosis of epithelial invasive ovarian carcinoma is established. This staging surgery currently encompasses a peritoneal cytology, the thorough inspection of all the visceral and parietal peritoneal surfaces with biopsy of any abnormality, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH + BSO), random peritoneal biopsies, omentectomy, appendectomy and bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomies, up to the left renal vein. The results of this staging procedure and its indications are discussed. In all of the cases, the radical removal of the pathologic adnexa is indicated, along with the complete peritoneal and retroperitoneal staging. While fertility-sparing surgery (avoiding hysterectomy and contralateral adnexectomy, if possible) seems to be safe for young women, a TAH + BSO is the rule for the others. Adjuvant chemotherapy can be omitted in well-differentiated tumors with a negative staging operation, but currently it remains indicated in all other cases. Indeed, the ultimate goal in early stage ovarian carcinoma is to not impair by inadequate management the high chance of a cure."
CD009786,0,10883025,0,Second-look and second surgery: second chance or second best?,"About 40 years ago, second-look laparotomy (SLL) was introduced to evaluate, surgically and pathologically, primary treatment in case a clinical complete remission was obtained in ovarian cancer patients. But does SLL increase the disease-free or overall survival? Important technical aspects of the procedure as: how many biopsies should be taken, can laparoscopy be replaced by laparotomy and should complete lymphadnectomy be performed at SLL, are still not clarified. This and maybe even more important issues, are disputed in literature: for instance, should a SLL be done at all, or should a SLL be performed in order to do a secondary cytoreduction in case tumour is found at the operation. If clinical remission is reached in more than 50% of the patients with advanced disease, tumour still can be found at SLL. If no tumour is found at SLL, macroscopically or microscopically, the operation is redundant. Apart from this, the recurrence rate after such a ""negative SLL"" is about 35%. Whether tumour found at SLL should be removed will depend on the fact if the tumour still is responsive to chemotherapy. To minimise the chance of tumour resistance, secondary surgery should be done as early as possible during treatment. Therefore, an interval debulking will be the intervention of choice. So, as long as there is no evidence that SLL increases the survival in ovarian cancer patients, it should be done in a research setting only. Also, the usefulness of secondary surgery for recurrent disease mainly depends on the chemo-sensitivity of the tumour. After a complete remission, which lasts for more than a year, complete secondary cytoreduction, again followed by chemotherapy, improves survival."

The majority of patients present with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Treatment with debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy is the standard approach while chemotherapy is contemplated when surgery is not possible. A correct pre-operative staging is important to ensure a most appropriate management. Laparoscopy (LPS) is the standard diagnostic tool for the assessment of intraperitoneal infiltration but is invasive and requires general anaesthesia. FDG-PET/CT is increasingly used for staging different types of cancer, and the aim of this study is to assess the value of FDG-PET/CT in staging advanced OC and its sensitivity to detect lesions in different quadrants of the abdominal-pelvic area compared to laparoscopy."

After laparoscopical confirmation of endometriosis, 59 patients were randomized to receive danazol (200 mg 3 times daily), MPA (100 mg daily) or placebo for 6 months. Clinical examinations were done before and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the beginning of the study, and a 2nd laparoscopy 6 months after termination of the medication. Eighteen patients in the danazol group, 16 in the MPA group and 17 in the placebo group completed the trial. Total or partial resolution of peritoneal implants was observed in 60% of the patients receiving danazol and in 63% of the patients receiving MPA. In the placebo group, resolution was observed in 18%, while the size of the implants was estimated to be increased in 23% of the patients. In relation to placebo, danazol and MPA significantly alleviated endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, lower back pain and defecation pain, but they did not differ from each other in these actions. The appearance of acne, muscle cramps, edema, weight gain and spotting bleeding complicated MPA treatment. The present results indicate that because of good efficacy and tolerance, high-dose MPA is a useful alternative in the hormonal treatment of endometriosis."

CD009786,0,21194826,0,Ovarian tumours in pregnancy: a literature review.,"Ovarian tumours in pregnancy are a diagnostic and management challenge that is increasingly being faced by the clinician. While most masses are benign and resolve spontaneously, there are others that persist and indicate the need for surgical management. Ultrasound not only detects asymptomatic masses but also helps to guide their management based on presence or absence of features suspicious of malignancy. The role of tumour markers in pregnancy is limited due to their non-specific nature. Most masses treated in pregnancy are benign (most commonly dermoids), and most malignancies are either of low malignant potential or germ cell tumours, usually early stage disease. Surgical management is indicated for symptomatic masses or those with increasing size or complexity indicating possible malignancy. Both laparoscopy and laparotomy have similar results with regard to obstetric outcome. Conservative management is preferred in the remainder. MRI may help in better characterization of doubtful masses. National tumour registries can help to establish guidelines."
CD009786,0,12756880,0,[Carcinoma of the fallopian tube after prophylactic laparoscopic ovariectomy in a patient with a BRCAI mutation].,"A 48-year-old woman with a distended abdomen appeared to have ascites and was admitted to the gynaecological ward. At the age of 31 years she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had undergone surgical breast conservation of the right breast. There was a history of both ovarian cancer and breast cancer in her family. Genetic evaluation showed that she was carrying a BRCAI germline mutation. At the age of 42 years she underwent a prophylactic bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy and 5 years later she underwent a complete mastectomy due to breast carcinoma of the left breast. Two months later she developed ascites, a raised CA125 level and on a CT scan carcinoma of the peritoneum. During the laparotomy a fallopian tube carcinoma was found. After the uterus, fallopian tubes and omentum had been surgically removed, chemotherapy took place. The patient tolerated this well and the CA125 value decreased. Recently, the first molecular evidence was found that linked fallopian tube cancer to germline mutations in BRCAI patients. Patients harbouring a BRCA germline mutation not only have an increased risk of ovarian carcinoma but also of fallopian tube carcinoma. Therefore, in patients with a BRCA mutation, prophylactic surgery should take the form of an adnexectomy, not an oophorectomy."

The total number of hysterectomies was 1491 from which 251 by laparoscopic approach, the rest being made by the classic methods (most of them by laparotomy and some by vaginal approach). In the statistic we have included 15 myomectomies, 4 cases of radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and 4 cases of complete hysterectomy after partial procedures made by laparotomy. The indications were represented mostly by uterine fibroma (82.07%), but also by uterine prolapse (13.14%), uterine bleeding, cervix severe dysplasia, uterine and cervix neoplasia (stage I) or associated to ovariectomy related to breast cancer. The paper analyses the results looking at the incidents and accidents (hemorrhagic, ureteral, urinary bladder or rectal lesions) and also postoperative complications (we had three reinterventions, two by laparoscopy and one by laparotomy). We also recorded one death not directly as a consequence of surgery, but as a diagnosis error. Regarding the surgical technique we initially chose the laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Afterwards by gaining experience we started treating the uterine pedicle and now we settled for the integral laparoscopic procedure. In our opinion laparoscopic hysterectomy represents all the advantages of mini-invasive approach. The technological development, but essentially the experience gained by surgeons are the key factors in accepting and promulgating the technique."

We report an open-label, two-center, phase II study of upfront paclitaxel for patients with histological diagnosis of stage III ovarian carcinoma. Treatment consisted of paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 administered in a 3-h infusion every 21 days. Response was evaluated after the third course by either laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy. Patients with stable or progressive disease discontinued treatment, whereas responding patients continued treatment until a maximum of six courses.

Colo-rectal cancer is the most frequent tumor in West Countries (United States 156,000 new case/year, Europe 58,300 deaths/year). A Medline analysis using terms ""colon and rectal cancer"" prove a progressive increasing of interest about many problems regard prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of colorectal cancer. Prognosis of colorectal cancer depend on correct and complete stadiation. The most used classifications are Dukes classification, modified from Astler-Coller, and TNM classification of UICC. In the past years oncologic al principle of colorectal surgery was modified from a new debated concept of oncological radicality. The authors analyze own experience in comparison to Literature about the ""no touch isolation technique"", the principle of vascular ligation at the origin of vessels, lymphectomy extension, total mesorectal excision, surgical decision about advanced loco-regional cancer, surgical decision of complicated colorectal cancer (perforation and occlusion), the role of bilateral prophylactic ovariectomy, surgical treatment of liver metastasis, correct indication of T.E.M. and finally the role of laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of colorectal cancer."

Since then, 112 such surgical procedures have been undertaken, including 36 pelvic lymphadenectomies, 20 para-aortic lymphadenectomies, 6 infrarenal paraaortic lymphadenectomies, 22 simple hysterectomies, 6 extended hysterectomies, 2 Schauta's radical hysterectomies, 4 omentectomies, 5 appendectomies, 3 ovarian transpositions, and 8 second look operations for ovarian cancer. All patients tolerated the procedures smoothly except for one who had hemostasis. There was also one complication of tumor seeding at the laparoscopic skin site. Our preliminary experience shows the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic procedures for gynecology and oncology patients.

Altogether, 90 patients were enrolled and only 4 were not suitable for tru-cut biopsy. The biopsy was taken either from pelvic tumor (54.6%), peritoneal visceral or parietal metastases (31.4%), or omental cake (14%). Samples were obtained transvaginally (53.5%) or transabdominally (46.5%). A diagnosis consistent with primary ovarian malignancy was made in 62.8%, metastatic ovarian involvement was found in 10.5%, and extraovarian tumor in 26.7%. The obtained tissue was adequate for histologic diagnosis in 80 out of 86 cases. In four cases, repeated biopsy was required to obtain a sufficient tissue sample. False-negative samples without tumor tissue were obtained in two cases, and those patients were referred for either laparoscopy or minilaparotomy. The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound-guided tru-cut biopsy reached 97.7% (95% CI 91.85-99.72%). There was only one complication, a bleeding from tumor in a patient with mild thrombocytopenia, requiring laparotomy. In conclusion, ultrasound-guided tru-cut biopsy is safe, reliable, and cost-effective diagnostic method. It can be performed in an outpatient setting without the need for general anesthesia and provides an adequate specimen for histologic analysis, including immunohistochemical methods. It should, therefore, be considered as a method of choice for histologic verification of both advanced primary and recurrent abdomino-pelvic tumors."

CD009786,0,7835810,0,Management of the adnexal mass.,"The methods for preoperative diagnosis and evaluation of the woman with a suspected ovarian neoplasm have evolved significantly with little or no impact on the surgical treatment, which remains removal of the abnormal ovary. Although most adnexal masses are benign, the primary goal of the diagnostic evaluation is the exclusion of malignancy. A complete history, physical examination, and ultrasonic imaging are vital in evaluating a suspected ovarian mass. In postmenopausal women, serum CA-125 determinations further improve sensitivity and specificity. Once the presence of an ovarian mass is established, the crucial decision is whether to observe the patient or proceed with surgical removal. If surgical removal is indicated, the proper procedure is important for staging and initiation of effective therapy. While many surgeons are now using the less invasive laparoscopic approach, the standard of care continues to be a laparotomy with either an ovarian cystectomy or oophorectomy. Future clinical research in the management of adnexal masses should focus on decreasing the number of patients undergoing a surgical procedure, and in patients who require surgery, further evaluation of laparoscopy as a safe, cost-effective means of treatment. Improved imaging techniques may allow for nonoperative management of probably benign ovarian neoplasms."

This article reviews the development of different wavelength lasers, the different tissue effects and their applications in infertility surgery. The CO2 laser remains the most precise laser, especially in the ultrapulse mode, for the division of adhesions and the accurate and safe vaporization of deposits of endometriosis. The neodymium:YAG laser, because of its greater depth of penetration, is more suited to hysteroscopic surgery, and attempts to focus the energy by sapphire tips and sculpted quartz fibres merely enable tissue to be incised by a thermal effect. Carbon dioxide laser energy is strongly absorbed by the water molecule and is rendered ineffective in the presence of blood so the visible light lasers, argon and potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP/532) lasers, are more suitable for the treatment of ovarian endometriomas and ectopic pregnancies. Techniques and results of laser surgery in endometriosis, tubal surgery, ectopic pregnancy and polycystic ovarian syndrome are reviewed. The main advantage of the various lasers is that they allow fertility surgeons to perform operative surgery by the minimally invasive approach of laparoscopy rather than laparotomy."

Robotic hysterectomies (RH), like traditional laparoscopic hysterectomies (LH), involve a significant amount of uterine manipulation. The use of a manipulator is thought to possibly increase the incidence of artifactual tumor displacement beyond the endometrium, including the fallopian tube. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is an association between RH and tumor present in the fallopian tube lumina. All RH and LH cases performed for endometrial cancer from May 2007 to August 2009 were reviewed. Of the cases not converted to laparotomy, 137 RH and 184 LH were identified. Age, body mass index, operative and hysterectomy time, type and grade of tumor, stage, pelvic wash results, and the presence of detached tumor fragments (contaminants) in the lumina of the fallopian tubes were recorded. Appropriate statistical tests were applied. Of the 184 LH, 4 (2.2%) were reported to have detached fragments of tumor in the lumina of the fallopian tubes compared with 16 of the 137 (11.7%) RH cases (P<0.001). The majority of the patients with RH and tumor present in the tubes had Stage I disease (9/16, 56.2%) and Grade 1 tumors (9/16, 56.2%). Four (4/16, 25%) patients had Stage IIIa disease detected by a pelvic wash. Patients with contaminants had a higher body mass index, but the difference was not statistically significant and was possibly due to small numbers. In conclusion, our data demonstrate an association between RH and tubal contamination. The clinical significance of this phenomenon remains to be determined."

It was carried out prospectively at Dr. Zekai Tahir Burak Women's Hospital of Ankara, Turkey. 943 women with 1035 adnexal masses who had undergone laparotomy and/or laparoscopy between January 1989 and March 1995 were included into the study group. All of these patients had a sonographic preoperatively examination within one week of surgery and the sonographic diagnosis was compared to histopathological findings. The visualization of: 1. echogenic mass with or without acoustic shadowing or enhancement (assumed to represent sebum with lipophilic contaminants or with hair) 2. Dermoid plug; layered lines and dots; fat-fluid level; isolated brigth echogenic foci with acoustic shadowing within the complex mass (assumed to represent Rokitansky protuberance; hair in low viscosity fluid; sebum as a supernatant of serous fluid; teeth or bone fragments respectively) 3. intraovarian echogenic mass with or without acoustic shadowing or enhancement (assumed to represent intraovarian dermoid cyst) were chosen as characteristical sonographic findings of dermoid cysts. Combining these with the subjective visual assessment of the operator, the sensitivity and the specificity were calculated for each visualized adnexal mass to assess the efficiency of sonography in differentiating dermoid cysts from other ovarian masses. All in all 1035 adnexal masses were visualized, 155 were suspected to be dermoid cysts and the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology in only 147 cases. The sensitivity and specificity of sonography were 94% and 99% respectively. As a conclusion this study demonstrates that ultrasonography has an accuracy of 98% in differentiating dermoid cysts from other adnexal masses with a specificity of 99%."

One hundred patients (group A) underwent second-look laparotomy and 47 patients (group B) other features of control: laparoscopy 37 patients, clinical control ten patients. Apart metastatic spread more frequent in group B (A vs B = 10 vs 32%) and tumor grade 1 more frequent in group B (A vs B = 33 vs 49%), the two groups were well balanced concerning tumor characteristics and treatment features. All patients had received a complementary treatment after the second-look procedures. With a median follow-up of 86 months in group A and 104 months in group B, no difference was found in overall nor in recurrence-free survival. Within group A, 34 patients had achieved pathologic proved complete remission. Their 5-year survival was 73% with an incidence of recurrence of 32%. Second-look laparotomy was found an invasive technique with a 15% operative morbidity. Its therapeutic apport seems absent and the diagnostic role limited to indication of radiotherapy in CR patients. Second-look laparotomies should be reserved to trials evaluating its proper place but should not be used systematically to assess tumor response to chemotherapy.

Forty-three patients had either an ovarian or a peritoneal biopsy performed after peritoneal lavage. The results indicate that 25% of the washings performed were successful in demonstrating endometrial glands or stroma. On the other hand, 72% of the patients on whom biopsies were performed showed endometrial tissue, and biopsy failures were mainly related to the technical difficulties of the ovarian biopsy. In 46% of the histologically proven cases of endometriosis, peritoneal lavage failed to demonstrate endometrial tissue. Conversely, in 4.6% of the negative biopsy cases, peritoneal lavage showed endometrial glands. We conclude that exfoliative cytology is not a useful tool in the diagnosis of endometriosis. On the other hand, we were able to make the diagnosis by biopsy in more than 70% of the patients on whom biopsies were performed."

Technologic advances and the proliferation of new equipment have occurred at a rapid rate. However, the criteria for the safe and appropriate use of endoscopic surgery have not been developed fully or followed by all surgeons, and there is some evidence that a lack of adherence to carefully considered protocols has the potential to have an adverse impact on women with ovarian lesions. McDonough made a thoughtful presentation on the need for technology assessment in the reproductive sciences, focusing on the fact that there has been a rapid diffusion of technology without prior broad-based critical peer review and stressing the need to have scientific technology assessment. Pitkin, in his editorial on operative laparoscopy, questioned whether we are evaluating therapeutic appropriateness properly as a separate and independent issue from technical feasibility. Obviously, it would be preferable to have had more controlled prospective data on the relative merits and risks of the use of the laparoscope for resection of ovarian cysts before the widespread use of this technology. However, there are several situations in which it currently appears to have important clinical utility for the patient. In addition, it already is being used widely, and it would be inappropriate to withhold this method from our patients. However, it should be urged that careful prospective evaluation be undertaken so that both the scientific community and the public are able to have an accurate understanding of the risks, benefits, indications, and contraindications of this technology.

Anovulatory women who are responsive to clomiphene citrate should be treated for at least six cycles and the treatment should probably be limited to a maximum of 12 cycles. It is necessary to monitor at least the first cycle with ultrasonography because of the risk of multiple pregnancy and the variable response of patients to different doses of clomiphene. In addition, the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome should not be underestimated. More triplets and higher order pregnancies result from ovulation induction than from in vitro fertilization, and multiple pregnancy has many risks for both mother and babies. The role of empirical clomiphene in the treatment of unexplained infertility is debatable and the present data are inconclusive. Obesity, hyperandrogenaemia and insulin resistance are important factors in clomiphene-resistant patients. Failure to ovulate in response to clomiphene has been approached by either medical or surgical treatment. An effective alternative medical treatment is gonadotrophin injections. Treatment with metformin and the new generation of insulin-sensitizing drugs is under evaluation. The most widely used surgical treatment today is laparoscopic ovarian drilling, which appears to be as effective as gonadotrophin therapy."

CD009786,0,16951393,0,Role of minimally invasive surgery in gynecologic cancers.,"The role of minimally invasive surgery in the management of gynecologic cancers continues to expand. Radical vaginal trachelectomy with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy has emerged as a safe, reasonable option for women with early-stage cervical cancer desiring fertility preservation. Similarly, laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy has been systematically described, is feasible, and can be offered to women with early-stage cervical cancer who do not desire future childbearing. In the treatment of early-stage endometrial cancer, the surgical approach of laparoscopic hysterectomy, peritoneal washings, and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, with or without an omentectomy, is being compared with the same surgery performed via laparotomy in the cooperative Gynecologic Oncology Group LAP 2 study, which has completed accrual, and appears to be a reasonable surgical option. In ovarian cancer, minimally invasive surgery has been incorporated to manage early-stage, advanced-stage, and recurrent disease, as well as second-look procedures. Hand-assisted laparoscopy has also recently been described in managing larger volume primary and recurrent gynecologic cancers. Extraperitoneal laparoscopy for para-aortic and pelvic lymph node dissections has been shown to yield adequate nodal counts and to be safe and feasible in the management of gynecologic cancers."

Six of the 7 patients who were thought to have ovarian carcinoma localized to the pelvis (stages I and II) were found to have advanced disease (stage III) at peritoneoscopy and thus required a change in therapy. Metastatic diaphragmatic involvement in ovarian carcinoma is common and was found in 77 percent of all patients studied. The routine shielding if the liver area ordinarily used with total abdominal radiotherapy would select these patients for therapeutic failure. Peritoneoscopy supplied reevaluable finding in 2 of 7 patients having normal physical, roentgenologic, and laboratory examinations, as well as in 93 percent of all patients stuided.

All patients had received six courses of cisplatin-paclitaxel-based chemotherapy intravenously. At the end of the laparoscopic staging, a 5-mm catheter was inserted under direct vision through a 5-mm trocar in the abdomen.

CD009786,0,3457709,0,Elevated serum concentrations of CA-125 in patients with advanced endometriosis.,"CA-125 is a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein that is expressed on the cell surface of some derivatives of embryonic coelomic epithelium. Based on results of an immunoradiometric assay developed to detect CA-125 in peripheral blood, 82% of patients with ovarian cancer and less than 1% of apparently healthy controls have elevated peripheral blood levels of CA-125. Because endometriotic lesions are likely to be derivatives of embryonic coelomic epithelium, the authors investigated serum CA-125 levels in patients with endometriosis. Preoperative serum CA-125 concentrations were measured in 147 patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy. Serum CA-125 concentrations were elevated in patients with stage III or IV endometriosis, compared with controls with negative diagnostic laparoscopies (66.5 +/- 14.5 versus 8.20 +/- 0.59 U/ml, mean +/- standard error of the mean; P less than 0.001). Fifty-four percent of patients with stage III or IV endometriosis and 0% of the controls had CA-125 levels greater than 35 U/ml. Occasional patients with stage II endometriosis (13%), leiomyomata uteri (14%), and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (5%) also had serum CA-125 concentrations greater than 35 U/ml.

An operation for a gynecologic malignancy is classified roughly into a surgery of internal pelvic organs and lymph nodes. The techniques which extensive technology is pursued involve radical hysterectomy and paraaortic lymph node excision.

CD009786,0,8422646,0,The cellular composition in the peritoneal cavity and the cytotoxic function of the peritoneal cells from patients with ovarian cancer; effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment.,"In patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the cellular composition in the peritoneal cavity and the functional capacities of the peritoneal cells (PC) are unknown. Especially the peritoneal macrophages (m phi) could play an important role in defense against tumor cells. To study the cellular composition in the peritoneal cavity and the functional capacities of PC, these cells were obtained from three patients with EOC. The PC were immunophenotyped and tested functionally in vitro in a cytotoxicity assay. One of the patients was treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single dose of 0.06 mg/m2 tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). PC were obtained before the treatment, after 24 h and after 1 week. PC from healthy women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization served as controls. It appeared that patients with EOC have a lower percentage of macrophages (m phi) in the peritoneal cavity than healthy persons. These m phi of patients were also less capable of killing U 937 tumor cells as compared to the peritoneal m phi of control persons. However, in the patient treated i.p. with TNF-alpha the cytotoxic capacities of the peritoneal m phi were strongly improved. The percentage cytotoxicity at an effector to target ratio of 10, increased from 17% to 80%. Thus, the peritoneal m phi in this patient were activated in vivo to a tumoricidal state. These findings indicate that PC in patients with EOC differ from controls, but further investigation is necessary to define the contribution of the disease and/or prior chemotherapy to this defect."

CD009786,0,7605086,0,Comparison of the usefulness of serum CA 125 level and a risk scoring system in detecting malignancy in ovarian cysts.,"A prospective study was carried out to compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the accuracy of serum CA 125 measurement with a clinical risk scoring system in the detection of malignant ovarian cysts. One hundred and three patients admitted to one department of obstetrics and gynaecology within a 12-month period were studied. There were 22 cases of malignant ovarian cysts. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were 81.8%, 72.0%, 43.9%, 93.7% and 75.0% respectively for a raised serum CA 125 measurement (> or = 35 u/ml) alone, and 90.9%, 64.8%, 40.8%, 96.4% and 70.2% respectively for a high risk score system (> or = 7 scores) alone. The specificity and positive predictive value were both further improved to 93.9% by combining a raised CA 125 level and high risk score of 7 or more as the predictive test. When used alone, the clinical risk scoring system picked up more FIGO stage I ovarian cancer than the raised serum CA 125 level. The findings of this study indicated that the risk scoring system is a useful predictor of malignant ovarian cysts. It needs to be assessed further in populations with different prevalence of ovarian cysts of various pathological types and malignancy before it can be advocated for general application, particularly in selecting ovarian cysts for laparoscopic surgery."
CD009786,0,22134021,0,Laparoscopy in pregnancy and the pediatric patient.,"Minimally invasive surgery is now standard of care for many procedures in pediatric gynecology. Laparoscopy has been well documented to produce faster recovery,decreased postoperative pain, and because of smaller incisions, a better cosmetic result. These are important when considering an active pediatric patient. Although a laparoscopic approach to endometriosis, adnexal masses, and ovarian torsion are well supported in the literature in the pediatric patient, more data are needed with regard to SILS in younger patients. Laparoscopy seems to be a better approach to oopheropexy in children undergoing radiation, and in resection of certain mullerian anomalies; however, the numbers are low.Similarly in pregnant patients, laparoscopy provides for shorter recovery times,decrease analgesic use and shorter hospital stays. Concerns about poor fetal outcomes in surgery during pregnancy for non gynecologic problems have been brought to light; however, the evidence indicates that these outcomes can be attributed to the nature of the underlying disease and not the surgical approach. With regard to pneumoperitoneum the effect of CO2 insufflation on fetal physiology and long-term outcomes remains unclear, and will continue to be an issue of controversy until larger studies are published.With both the pediatric and pregnant populations, laparoscopic complications can be diminished when performed by skilled surgeons with strict adherence to good technical principles. The advantages of laparoscopy are great, and this approach should be considered in pediatric and pregnant patients."
CD009786,0,8329645,0,Surgery for malignant gynecologic disease.,"The surgical management of malignant gynecologic disease continues to evolve as more is learned about the natural history and biology of these neoplasms. Whereas curing malignancies remains the ultimate goal of most surgical procedures for gynecologic cancers, the importance of quality of life cannot be ignored. Surgical procedures that enhance the quality of life without compromising cure continue to be explored. In vulvar cancer, the disfiguring classical radical vulvectomy is being replaced by more conservative procedures. As anesthetic techniques and postoperative care continue to improve, the role of radical surgery for invasive and recurrent cervical cancer has been extended to include older women. Ovarian cancer continues to be the most lethal of all gynecologic malignancies, and the role of aggressive primary and secondary cytoreduction continues to be defined.

The routine use of pelvic imaging (sonography), in the case of any gynaecological symptom or as a screening method in women at risk, explains why more and more ovarian cysts are encountered. The diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the clinician to provide the best immediate and long-term benefits for the patient is to identify pre-operatively not only an ovarian malignancy (to be treated in a conventional way) but also functional cysts (usually disappearing spontaneously and requiring no form of treatment in most cases). Ideally, only benign 'organic' cysts should be treated laparoscopically. The technical aspects and the benefits of this approach have been documented extensively in recent years. The routine use of the 'closed technique' and of an impermeable bag for removal should limit the risk of spillage of the cyst contents with its inherent potential problems (chemical peritonitis, malignant cell dissemination and parietal implantation into the laparoscopic port sites). The adnexal torsion can be also properly managed by laparoscopic surgery."

The complication rate has been found to increase as the complexity of the operation rises, but it is not higher than in open surgery. Preliminary studies show that recurrence and survival rates are comparable to those reported for patients treated by a standard abdominal approach. Future randomised trials are necessary to deal with long term recurrences and survival data and benefits of laparoscopy in management of gynecologic malignancies. At our institution 97 cancer patients underwent laparoscopic procedures, without complications: explorative and staging laparoscopies with biopsies of ovaries, peritoneal biopsies, retroperitoneal and mesenteric tumours; second look laparoscopy, ovariectomy, laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH).

CD009786,0,7593516,0,The value of cyst puncture in the differential diagnosis of benign ovarian tumours.,"A prospective collection of serum samples and ovarian cyst fluid was used to assess the use of different tumour markers and cyst fluid cytology in combination with serum tumour markers for the differential diagnosis of benign ovarian cysts. A consecutive series of 108 women of median age 30 years (range 15-75) undergoing laparotomy or operative laparoscopy for presumedly benign ovarian cyst(s) were studied at a teaching hospital at the University of Milan, Italy. The main outcome measures were tumour markers CA 125, CA 19.9 and carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in serum and ovarian cyst fluid, oestradiol and progesterone concentrations in cyst fluid, and cytology of the sediment. The studied cysts were endometriotic (55 subjects), dermoid (16), mucinous (12), serous (10) or of miscellaneous histotype (15, including four follicular and one luteal). Serum CA 125 concentrations were significantly higher in the endometrioma patients than in the other groups. The sensitivity of CA 125 in the differentiation of endometriomas from other adnexal tumours was 61.8% and the specificity 94.3%; combining CA 125 and CA 19.9 assays yielded a sensitivity of 83.6% and specificity of 62.3%. Cyst fluid tumour markers values were extremely scattered with ample overlap between different cyst types. Oestradiol and progesterone concentrations were similar in the histological subgroups. Cyst fluid cytology was non-specific. We concluded that the aspiration of fluid from presumedly benign ovarian cysts appears to contribute little to the differential diagnosis of various tumours. The use of combining serum CA 125 and CA 19.9 assays in the diagnosis of endometriomas needs further confirmation."

Nevertheless, the morphologic analysis of these fluids frequently provides false-negative findings. As shown in other areas of cytodiagnosis, monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to tumor-associated antigens may be a useful adjunct to overcome the limitations of conventional cytopathologic examination of PW. To evaluate this question, immunocytochemical tests were done using a panel of four MoAb to ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (B72.3, MOv18, MOv19, and OC-125) to analyze 117 PW sampled during initial surgical staging and 121 PW harvested at second-look operations. The results of this study showed that immunocytochemical tests using the combination of the four reagents could improve cytodiagnosis more than 15% in both groups of PW.

CD009786,0,17362319,0,Characterization of an intraperitoneal ovarian cancer xenograft model in nude rats using noninvasive microPET imaging.,"MicroPET is a noninvasive imaging modality that can potentially track tumor development in nude rats using the radiotracer fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG). Our goal was to determine whether microPET, as opposed to more invasive techniques, could be used to noninvasively monitor the development of ovarian cancer in the peritoneal cavity of nude rats for monitoring treatment response in future studies. Female nude rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with 36 million NIH:OVCAR-3 cells. Imaging was carried out at 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks postinoculation. Each rat was fasted overnight and intravenously injected with 11.1 MBq (300 microCi) of (18)F-FDG in 0.2 mL of saline. Thirty minutes following injection, the rats were placed in the microPET and scanned for 30 min. After imaging, rats were euthanized for ascites and tissue collection for biodistribution and histopathologic correlation. Standard uptake values (SUVs) of (18)F-FDG within the peritoneal cavity were also calculated from regions of interest analysis of the microPET images. MicroPET images showed diffuse increased uptake of (18)F-FDG throughout the peritoneal cavity of tumor rats (mean SUV=4.64) compared with control rats (mean SUV=1.03). Ascites gathered from tumor-bearing rats had increased (18)F-FDG uptake as opposed to the peritoneal fluid collected from control rats. Biodistribution data revealed that the percent injected dose per gram (% ID/g) was significantly higher in tumor-bearing rats (6.29%) than in control rats (0.59%) in the peritoneal lymph nodes. Pathology verified that these lymph nodes were more reactive in tumor-bearing rats. By 6 weeks, some rats developed solid masses within the peritoneum, which could be detected on microPET images and confirmed as tumor by histopathology. (18)F-FDG uptake in these tumors at necropsy was 2.83% ID/g. These results correlate with previous invasive laparoscopic studies of the same tumor model and demonstrate that microPET using (18)F-FDG is a promising noninvasive tool to localize and follow tumor growth in an intraperitoneal ovarian cancer model."

CD009786,0,16445616,0,Impact of initial surgical access on staging and survival of patients with stage I ovarian cancer.,"The aim of this study was to compare staging by laparoscopy and laparotomy, and to compare survival in patients with laparoscopy versus laparotomy as the first surgical access. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with stage I ovarian cancer treated surgically between 1985 and 2001, and we included those patients with stage I epithelial cancer for whom follow-up data were available. For each patient, we recorded whether initial surgical staging was by laparoscopy or by laparotomy, the procedures done at initial staging surgery, and the outcomes. The data were evaluated by analysis of variance, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, logistic regression, Cox model, and log-rank test, using SPSS 7.5 and STATA. Initial staging was by laparoscopy in 34 patients, laparotomy in 114 patients, and laparoscopy converted to laparotomy in 30 patients. In the laparotomy group, patient age was significantly greater and tumor size significantly larger, as compared to the laparoscopy group. Staging after first surgery was often inadequate; most notably para-aortic lymph node dissection was done in 0% of laparoscopy patients, 18% of laparotomy patients, and 33% of conversion patients. Restaging surgery has been indicated in 88% of laparoscopy patients, 48% of laparotomy patients, and 46% of conversion ones. After a mean follow-up of 40 months, survival rates were not significantly different among the three patient groups. No deleterious influence of laparoscopy as first surgical access was detected by univariate or multivariate analysis. Despite of inaccurate radicality and staging during initial laparoscopy, this study found no harmful influence of laparoscopy as first initial access on outcomes of patients with stage I ovarian cancer."

CD009786,0,10410886,0,Laparoscopic prophylactic oophorectomy in women with inherited risk of ovarian cancer.,"The aim of this study was to specify the surgical procedure most adapted for prophylactic laparoscopic oophorectomy in patients with an inherited risk of ovarian cancer. This prospective study was based on a series of 27 patients who underwent prophylactic bilateral laparoscopic oophorectomy between September 1995 and January 1998. Nine patients underwent an oophorectomy (33%) and 18 patients an adnexectomy (67%). The laparoscopic procedure was converted into a laparotomy in one patient in whom an ovarian adenocarcinoma was detected during the surgical procedure. During final histologic examination of the ovaries, 23 patients were found to have benign atypical histologic alterations, one patient had an ovarian adenocarcinoma and only three patients (11%) had normal ovaries. In women with an inherited risk of ovarian cancer, during the laparoscopic procedure for prophylactic oophorectomy, the abdomino-pelvic cavity should be thoroughly explored with peritoneal cytology and systematic peritoneal biopsies. The laparoscopic procedure could be converted into a laparotomy if an ovarian cancer is discovered."

Laparoscopy confirmed normal ovaries and a jejunal mass which was resected at laparotomy. This circumstance has very rarely been described in the literature and represents a diagnostic dilemma of which clinicians should be aware. Intra-abdominal lymphangioma should be included with other non-gynaecological diseases in the differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass, and requires a multi-specialty approach."

CD009786,0,19745797,0,The value of laparoscopic surgery to stage gynecological cancers: present and future.,"The laparoscopic management of gynecologic cancers has been discussed controversely since decades. Much progress has been achieved technically enabling an experienced endoscopic surgeon to perform most of the gynecologic oncologic procedures such as hysterectomy, omentectomy, pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection. Although the value of laparoscopy with respect to oncological safety and patient's outcome has not been shown in prospective randomized clinical trials, many studies with altogether thousands of patients have revealed the feasibility and also similar oncologic results of laparoscopy when compared to laparotomy. Therefore, the laparoscopic approach has become well accepted for certain oncological indications, especially when early stage cancer cases are treated. These indications are also subject to ongoing Phase III trials: The LACC001 trial compares Total Laparoscopic Radical Hysterectomy (TLRH) or total robotic radical hysterectomy with total abdominal radical hysterectomy (TARH) for the treatment of early stage cervical cancer. The GOG LAP 2 and also the LACE001 trial compare total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) with total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) for the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer, whereby bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection is performed according to tumor stage and grade. This review summarizes the current status of laparoscopy in gynecologic oncology based on the literature to date, the ongoing clinical trials, and the recommendations of the German Gynecologic Oncology Group (AGO)."

In this review, we discuss recent findings on the outcomes of fertility-sparing treatments in patients with BOTs."
CD009786,0,8924000,0,Experience in laparoscopic hysterectomy: analysis of three hundred cases.,"A personal experience with 300 cases of laparoscopic hysterectomy was analysed and its merits and demerits were discussed. The demographic features, indications, feasibility, complications, operating time, blood loss, hospital stay, cost effectiveness and its outcome were reviewed. The indications were uterine fibroid (40%), adenomyosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease (36%), fibroid uterus with endometriosis (17.5%), postmenopausal bleeding (3%), ovarian neoplasm (2.1%) and fibroid uterus with ovarian cyst (1.4%). Two uterine malignancies and one case of potentially malignant ovarian neoplasm, were also encountered in our series. Assessibility score of above 20 was present in 55%. Haemorrhage was prevented intraoperatively by securing the large pedicles with electrocoagulation as well as large titanium clips (LT-400). Retrograde ureteric catheterisation was not necessary. Overall morbidity was present only in 10.62%. Intraoperative bladder injury was encountered in 1%, urinary fistula in 0.66%, primary and secondary haemorrhage in 0.33% respectively, and minor febrile morbidity in 4.66%. Conversion to conventional abdominal hysterectomy occurred in 0.66% of the cases. The average operating time was 141.99 +/- 31.678 min, the estimated blood loss was 237.07 +/- 76.76 ml and average hospitalisation was 3.37 +/- 0.66 days. The cost of laparoscopic hysterectomy was found similar to abdominal hysterectomy. Higher operating fee, operating theatre and anaesthesia charges did not affect the overall cost of laparoscopic hysterectomy because of shorter hospital stay. It is concluded that laparoscopic hysterectomy has definite role in gynaecological surgery."

A Medline search was performed for all port site recurrences published in the literature. These reports were analysed and port site recurrences studied to determine initial stage of cancers, time to recurrence and whether the port site was an isolated site of recurrence or part of widespread intra-abdominal disease. The possible aetiologies were similarly reviewed and several recent basic science reports assessed. To date, 93 port site recurrences have been published. These have occurred with colorectal cancers as well as ovarian, gastric, pancreatic and other malignancies. Often, these recurrences are isolated and most standard means of prevention of cell dissemination may not prevent their occurrence. Possible mechanisms include aerosolisation of tumour cells, exfoliation, and changes in immune function. Port site recurrences continue to be reported. Their aetiology is unclear but the occurrence is of concern and requires continued scrutiny for laparoscopic oncologic surgery."

Stratification was made according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and according to size of residual disease after surgery. Response was evaluated after six courses when patients were restaged, with laparoscopy or laparotomy in clinical complete responders or those with no assessable disease. Treatment was then stopped in surgically proven complete responders. Patients with partial (PR) or minor response (MR) received a further six courses of their original drug at a reduced dose (carboplatin 300 mg/m2, iproplatin 225 mg/m2). Patients with stable (SD), progressive (PD), or recurrent disease were treated with cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2). The response rates were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 74%) for carboplatin and 38% (95% CI, 26% to 51%) for iproplatin. Fifteen patients were not assessable for response. The median survival was 114 weeks (95% CI, 82 to 233 weeks) for carboplatin patients and 68 weeks (95% CI, 48 to 82 weeks) for iproplatin patients (P = .008). The amount of residual disease after initial laparotomy was a prognostic factor for survival. Myelosuppression was the main toxicity and was greater with iproplatin. This study shows carboplatin to be more active than iproplatin in the treatment of ovarian cancer and less toxic. Few responses to cyclophosphamide occurred following either drug, implying resistance to the alkylating agent."

This procedure has been included in the protocol for the treatment of these tumors. During the period 1980-1987 a total of 3038 laparoscopies were performed; 205 (7%) were for ovarian cancer. We present the results of 72 explorations in 52 patients; after surgery and chemotherapy all of them were in complete remission. 44 explorations were second-look laparoscopy and 28 third-look laparoscopy. All the examinations were done under local anesthesia. There were two failures due to the presence of adhesions secondary to the previous surgery which prevented the pneumoperitoneum. In 35 (48.6%) explorations a neoplasia was found and a laparotomy was avoided. There were 31% (4/13) false negative in second-look laparotomy post-laparoscopy. The correlation between gross and microscopic findings was excellent. There were no complications in spite of the previous abdominal surgery. We recommend second-look laparoscopy in patients under treatment of ovarian cancer which in our experience avoided laparotomy almost in half of the cases; no complications were observed and the procedure was well-tolerated.

CD009786,0,8775267,0,Unexpected ovarian malignancy diagnosed after laparoscopic surgery.,The main concerns for laparoscopic management of ovarian masses are unexpected malignancy and the spillage of the cyst content. Careful preoperative evaluation is important in proper patient selection. We report a case of unexpected ovarian malignancy managed by operative laparoscopy in a 29-year-old woman. The role of ultrasonographic and laparoscopic assessment and their limitations are discussed. The potential role of intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasonographic assessment of the ovarian masses is proposed.
CD009786,0,14644836,0,Laparoscopy and oncology: where do we stand today?,"The clinical application of laparoscopic surgery has grown rapidly over the last few years. Since the first documentations of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy, many reports highlight the use of modern laparoscopy in the field of gynecologic oncology. Laparoscopic treatment of early-stage cervical and endometrial cancer, and laparoscopic evaluation and staging of cervical, ovarian, and endometrial carcinomas, are feasible procedures. The place of minimal-access surgery in the arsenal of gynecologic oncological surgery has been established, especially after the recent developments and practical application of video laparoscopy, novel instrumentation, and advanced surgical techniques. Although operative laparoscopy in gynecologic oncology is still in its infancy the potentiality of the procedure is underscored. Many patients may benefit from the treatment or staging of gynecologic malignancies with laparoscopic means. Literature reports highlight that laparoscopy may be an effective procedure with lower morbidity and complication rates than traditional abdominal surgery. The short hospital stay and recovery time have a positive impact in a cancer patient's quality of life, as they return to normal activities rapidly. Many risks, though, may arise from the application of minimal-access surgery in cancer patients, and many questions regarding safety and efficacy need answers, based on prospective clinical trials. We must emphasize that such studies with large patient numbers and long-term follow-up are lacking. Until results from these trials are available, laparoscopic oncologic procedures should be performed only in an investigational setting by expert teams."

The publications were further limited to English-language articles, those addressing adnexal mass management, early stage ovarian cancer, and advanced stage ovarian cancer treatments. The articles were divided into 4 broad categories: adnexal masses, low malignant potential tumors, early stage ovarian cancer, and advanced ovarian cancer. For each category, a further subdivision into case reports, case series, and finally cohorts was developed and summarized. Additional articles were obtained based on the bibliographic cross-reference of the initial articles reviewed. The current literature defining the role of laparoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer is limited to case reports, case series, and cohort studies. However, these limited studies suggest equal efficacy of laparoscopy compared with laparotomy in both early and advanced stage ovarian cancer."

A markedly elevated maternal serum alphafetoprotein (MSAFP) suggested a diagnosis of endodermal sinus tumour of the ovary. A right salpingo-oophorectomy at 19 weeks' gestation enabled histological confirmation of the diagnosis and suggested a stage 1 tumour. Unfortunately tumour recurrence necessitated further laparotomy and delivery by caesarean section at 32 weeks' gestation. A total abdominal hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy was undertaken with resection of the splenic flexure and formation of a double-barrelled colostomy after which no gross intraperitoneal tumour remained. Three weeks later a new suprahepatic tumour mass was excised and the colostomy was closed. The patient then received four cycles of combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Unfortunately she developed a faecal fistula at the site of the colostomy. Germ cell tumours are highly responsive to chemotherapy.

Primary retroperitoneal teratomas are extremely rare in adults. A 27-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of an incidentally found pelvic mass, considered to be an ovarian tumor by ultrasonography. Computed tomography strongly suggested a retroperitoneal cystic tumor because of anterior displacement of retroperitoneal organs. The large retroperitoneal mature teratoma was successfully resected laparoscopically without complication. In this case, despite a large tumor size and its approaching the rectum, total laparoscopic resection was the most feasible surgical choice."
CD009786,0,10541371,0,A phase II study of intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy with iodine-131-labeled monoclonal antibody OC-125 in patients with residual ovarian carcinoma.,"Standard treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Additional therapies using the i.p. route are considered as a potential means of improving the locoregional control rate. This Phase II study evaluated the efficacy of i.p. radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in patients with minimal residual ovarian adenocarcinoma after primary treatment with surgery and chemotherapy. Between February 1995 and March 1996, six patients with residual macroscopic (<5 mm) or microscopic disease as demonstrated by laparotomy and multiple biopsies received i.p. RIT. All had initial stage III epithelial carcinoma and were treated with debulking surgery and one line (four patients) or two lines (two patients) of chemotherapy. RIT was performed with 60 mg of OC 125 F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody labeled with 4.44 GBq (120 mCi) of 131I injected 5-10 days after the surgical procedure. Systematic laparoscopy or laparotomy with multiple biopsies performed 3 months after RIT in five patients (clinical progression was seen in one patient) showed no change in three patients and progression in two patients. Toxicity was mainly hematological, with grade III neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in two patients. Human antimouse antibody production was demonstrated in all six patients. This study showed little therapeutic benefit from i.p. RIT in patients with residual ovarian carcinoma."

It is usually associated with ascites and raised CA-125 levels. Occasionally a pelvic mass may be present making the preoperative differential diagnosis from advanced ovarian cancer extremely difficult. Acid-fast stains and special cultures of the ascitic fluid for Mycobacterium tuberculosis are frequently negative, and confirmation of the diagnosis commonly requires histologic examination of biopsy specimens, in which epithelioid granulomas with central caseous necrosis can be identified. We present a case of unexplained pyrexial ascites in a postmenopausal woman in whom the diagnosis of miliary peritoneal tuberculosis was confirmed laparoscopically.

CD009786,0,17000446,0,Acute pulmonary embolism following laparoscopic ovariectomy: a case report.,"Laparoscopic surgery is usually considered to be less invasive when compared to traditional laparotomy, and is regarded as a relatively low-risk procedure for postoperative complications because of the reduced surgical stress and earlier mobilization. However, we describe a 47-year-old woman who presented with acute respiratory distress, drowsy consciousness, and circulatory collapse shortly after gynecologic laparoscopic ovariectomy for removing an ovarian teratoma at a local hospital. After resuscitation, the patient was transferred to our emergency department. Immediate bedside electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination results led to acute pulmonary embolism being quickly diagnosed. The patient received subsequent intensive care with smooth course. Although pulmonary embolism is rare after laparoscopic surgery, early detection and quick treatment are important in the management of this life-threatening complication and offer good prognosis. The risk of pulmonary embolism after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery remains unclear. Therefore, the decision to provide prophylaxis is up to the individual physician, and should take into consideration the patient's individual risk factors and comorbidities."
CD009786,0,22264278,0,Laparoscopy to predict the result of primary cytoreductive surgery in advanced ovarian cancer patients (LapOvCa-trial): a multicentre randomized controlled study.,"Standard treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is surgery and chemotherapy. The goal of surgery is to remove all macroscopic tumour, as the amount of residual tumour is the most important prognostic factor for survival. When removal off all tumour is considered not feasible, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in combination with interval debulking surgery (IDS) is performed. Current methods of staging are not always accurate in predicting surgical outcome, since approximately 40% of patients will have more than 1 cm residual tumour after primary debulking surgery (PDS). In this study we aim to assess whether adding laparoscopy to the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of advanced ovarian carcinoma may prevent unsuccessful primary debulking surgery for ovarian cancer."

CD009786,0,22932780,0,Robotic surgery for gynaecologic cancer: an overview.,"After decades of reluctance to change surgical approaches, new technologies have created new perspectives for surgery. Initially, the laparoscopic approach was considered to be only one useful for relatively simple procedures as the design of the instruments and the limited access hampered free movements to perform complicated surgery. Robotic systems overcame this problem and boosted the use of minimally invasive techniques also for radical gynaecological surgery. Robot-assisted laparoscopy can now routinely be used for the surgical treatment of early or downstaged cervical carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma and staging of early ovarian carcinoma. Robot-assisted laparoscopy has proven to be feasible, although the benefits for the patient are less clear than those for the surgeon. The main advantage of robot-assisted laparoscopy over conventional laparoscopy is probably not that it is safer or better, but that it allows more types of radical surgery to be performed and that it prevents the surgeon from developing complaints and muscular conditions that interfere with the ability to perform surgery. New applications have emerged with the introduction of new devices to be used in conjunction with the robotic system as well as with totally new robotic systems. Training in these new tools should be more systematic and structured to allow their safe introduction and use."

In most cases of gonadal dysgenesis with a germ cell tumour a Y-chromosome is present. The risk of a gonadal tumour in such cases is estimated to be 25%. In gonadal dysgenesis with a Y-chromosome a prophylactic extirpation of the gonads is necessary, which should be combined with a hysterectomy."

MR findings were correlated with the results of laparoscopy (13 women) and laparotomy (17 women). Surgical examination revealed a normal pelvis in five patients and endometriosis in 25. Three of the five normal cases and 16 of the 25 cases of endometriosis were correctly identified with MR imaging (sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 60%; accuracy, 63%). MR imaging demonstrated seven of eight endometriomas but only 14 of 29 adhesions and only six of 45 endometrial implants. While MR imaging demonstrated endometriomas, ovarian adhesions, and extraperitoneal endometrial implants, it could not accurately depict extraovarian endometrial adhesions and intraperitoneal endometrial implants. In addition, MR imaging findings did not correlate with the surgically determined severity of the disease. These limitations indicate that MR imaging cannot be used as the primary modality in the detection, characterization, and staging of endometriosis; laparoscopy remains the procedure of choice."

CD009786,0,7557223,0,[Initial experiences with laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound].,"Preoperative ultrasound as well as intraoperative laparoscopic diagnosis have both their limits, a fact that might be significant for laparoscopic surgical management. In particular, since in this surgical domain, where almost everything has become technically feasible, the operator must decide what is to the benefit of the patient. A possible solution could be laparoscopic ultrasound, i.e. ultrasound diagnosis per laparoscopy at the very site of the lesion. The advantages are evident. Due to the closeness to the organ to be examined, the frequency of the scan head can be extremely high, resulting in better resolution. Also, structures could be visualized by ultrasound which e.g., due to adhesions cannot be seen with the laparoscope. Moreover, ultrasound offers a view into the structures which can be seen only from the exterior with the laparoscope. To perform these examinations we used a specially designed scanhead (Toshiba): Instead of the optical system a crystal array was inserted into a conventional gastroscope. The result was a high resolution 7.5 MHz linear array at the distal end of a freely movable gastroscope. Colour doppler sonography is feasible with this scanhead. We examined 19 patients, 16 of them with ovarian tumours, and attempted visualization of the uterine myometrium/endometrium as well as of the liver. In six cases of ovarian tumours in which only cystic structures were found by preoperative transvaginal sonography, laparoscopic ultrasound additionally revealed solid inner structures. In 5 cases direct laparoscopic view of the ovarian lesions was impossible due to severe adhesions. They were, however, easily detected by intraoperative ultrasound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009786,0,7835808,0,The role of prophylactic oophorectomy in cancer prevention.,"Prophylactic oophorectomy is presently the only effective method of ovarian cancer prevention. This study reviews current data on how prophylactic oophorectomy (PO) should be used in different risk groups. It is estimated that 7% of ovarian cancer patients have positive family history, of which 3-9% may end up having hereditary cancer syndromes. Women in direct genetic lineage of family cancer syndromes may have up to 50% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Because of such a high risk, PO is indicated for women with familial cancer syndromes after childbearing or the age of 35-40 at the latest. Most women with positive family history of ovarian cancer do not have one of the recognized hereditary cancer syndromes. However, women with one or two affected relatives do have an increased lifetime risk of ovarian cancer from a baseline of 1.6 to 5-7%. This risk is not high enough to warrant PO recommendation for a large number of women. After being properly informed and the patient still desires surgical prevention (i.e., cancer phobia), PO then becomes an indicated procedure. In women without family history of ovarian cancer, the role of PO remains controversial. The decision of PO as a concurrent procedure to other indicated gynecologic surgeries should depend on the individual patient and her ability to comply with lifelong estrogen replacement therapy."

Apropos of a case and review of the literature].,"Dermoid cyst is the most frequent benign ovarian tumor. Its intraperitoneal rupture may lead to a peritoneal reaction known as chemical peritonitis. It is a rare but a potentially dangerous issue. Its treatment may need one or more reoperations. We report here the case of a patient operated on in emergency for a torsion of an ovarian dermoid cyst, with peritoneal spillage of its content during coeliosurgery. The prolonged contact between the sebaceous material and the peritoneum has led to a chemical peritonitis. Two more laparoscopic interventions, associated with a systemic anti-inflammatory treatment, were necessary to relieve symptoms. We propose the following attitude to avoid this complication: (1) puncture and drainage of the cyst with a trocar; (2) extraction of the cyst in an endobag, and (3) abundant washout of the peritoneal cavity."
CD009786,0,1828651,0,The use of potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser for laparoscopic removal of ovarian endometrioma.,"From January 1989 through January 1990, 31 patients thought to have ovarian endometrioma at ultrasonography were treated by operative laparoscopy and potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The endometriomas ranged from 2 to 9.2 cm in diameter by preoperative transvaginal ultrasonography. The operative procedure used was a three-puncture technique with a 600 micron fiber attached to a potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The power setting was 10 W with a continuous pulse. In all cases endometriomas were opened, drained, and irrigated, and the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser was used to vaporize or remove the entire cyst lining. The ovarian edges were inverted with the laser at the end of the procedure. With one exception, there was no recurrence of endometrioma at 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure, on the basis of transvaginal ultrasonography or laparoscopy. In one case, 4 months after the initial laparoscopic procedure, exploratory laparotomy was performed for resection of a large, recurrent endometrioma. The use of the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser allows the laparoscopic surgeon an aggressive approach to ovarian endometriomas that in the past necessitated exploratory laparotomy."

CD009786,0,6215076,0,[Surgery's place in the treatment of ovarian cancer].,"Surgery must remain in first place as it allows for: --biopsy by direct access, --the assessment of the peritoneal and visceral extensions, --a cytological pre-operative study of the liquid of the peritoneal lavage which might lead the surgeon to suspect otherwise unnoticed extensions--a frozen section examination of the lumbar nodes or of the other apparently normal ovary. But surgery is, above all, indispensable in order to achieve ""tumoral reduction"", as large as possible by total hysterectomy with the ablation of both annexae as well as of the epiploon. Nevertheless the surgeon is often obliged to leave cancerous centers impossible to remove and he also fails to recognize the mini-centers grafted on the peritoneum and the viscera; he therefore has an imperative need of the complementary actions of polychemo--or radiation therapy in order to sterilise or neutralize these centers. A routine ""second look"" after chemotherapy must be done even if laparoscopy is negative; this makes it possible to judge whether treatment can be discontinued; it seems capable of significantly increasing the chances of treatment in the case of a limited recurrence of a slightly developed tumor; it can make possible secondary exeresis of certain originally inoperable forms. Combined treatment and secondary controls, in particular by means of a re-intervention appear to be a serious hope of improving the results thanks, above all, to the recent contribution of chemotherapy."

Among the side effects of chemotherapy treatments are ovarian failure and infertility, which are of particularly great concern to young cancer patients. Recently, cryopreservation procedures such as in vitro fertilization and embryo storage, or ovarian tissue cryopreservation have been used to preserve fertility in patients subjected to cancer treatments. Knowledge of the risks and probabilities of ovarian failure as well as the risks of the cryopreservation procedures is crucial for patients and physicians in order to make informed choices that will best serve the patients interests. This article presents data of a prospective study that determines the risk of ovarian failure following exposure to chemotherapy as well as a review of related publications. Progressive, dose-related depletion of primordial follicles is noted on histology, explaining the risk of undergoing premature ovarian failure years after exposure to chemotherapy. The safety of ovarian tissue cryopreservation procedures with a new round biopter was evaluated, as well as the risk of malignant cell transmission. It has been shown that laproscopic ovarian biopsy performed with the round biopter is a safe and efficient method for collection of ovarian tissue in cancer patients. In Hodgkin's disease patients' ovarian cortical tissue obtained for cryopreservation does not contain malignant cells. However the risk of cryopreserving and transferring malignant cells should be tested separately for each disease according to the risk of ovarian metastasis and the ability to detect single malignant cells."
CD009786,0,10469692,0,Factors that increase the risk of leakage during surgical removal of benign cystic teratomas.,"The contents of mature cystic teratomas can be a potent irritant resulting in chemical peritonitis. Using a retrospective cohort, we examined the various risk factors for leakage of benign cystic teratomas during laparoscopy and laparotomy. Cyst leakage of the benign cystic teratoma contents was the primary endpoint. In all, 158 women underwent surgery for a total of 178 ovarian benign cystic teratomas. Statistical analysis was performed using chi(2), Mann-Whitney U and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 115 benign cystic teratomas was successfully removed without intra-operative leakage and 63 underwent intra-operative leakage either at laparoscopy or laparotomy. The likelihood of success of removing the benign cystic teratoma intact was unrelated to age, pre-operative size or surgical technique. There was no difference among cystectomies performed by laparotomy in surgeon experience or the presence of adhesions. However, surgeons with more laparoscopic experience (>35 laparoscopies/year) were less likely to have intra-operative leakage (relative risk: 0.5, 95% confidence interval: 0.2, 1.2) compared to surgeons with less experience (<20/year) at cystectomy (26.1 versus 51.2% respectively). Oophorectomy significantly reduced the frequency of intra-operative leakage at both laparoscopy and laparotomy (14.7%). These findings suggest that laparoscopic experience can reduce the risk of leakage at cystectomy. At laparotomy, lack of surgeon postgraduate years of experience was not a risk factor for leakage."

There were 263 operations of the benign adnexal masses, and 107 operations due to benign tumors of corpus uteri (there were 18 LAVH, 12 LH and 77 TLH). There were 11 laparoscopic operations due to carcinoma (1 ovary, 6 corpus and 4 cervix). Operations were: 3 LAVH (laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy), 5 TLH (total laparoscopic hysterectomy) with pelvic lymphadenectomy, 1 LAVH with pelvic lymphadenectomy, 1 coelio Shauta operation with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy and paraaortal lymphadenectomy, and 1 laparoscopic adnexectomy. Among laparoscopic procedures in 370 patients operations were successfully performed as planed, while in 11 patients it was necessary to switch to laprotomy. Among serious complications of laparscopic operations it is necessary to note 2 lesions of the ureter and 1 lesion of the bladder. Laparoscopic lymphadenectomies were performed successfully; there were no serious early or late postoperative complications. There was no operative mortality.

CD009786,0,17948753,0,[Benign and borderline tumors of the ovary].,"Alterations of the ovaries easily cause diagnostic uncertainty about relevance and consequence. Palpable or sonographic ovarian tumors are reason for various differential diagnoses. Therefore the clarification of ovarian lesions is one of the main duties in daily gynaecological practice. Although diagnostic procedures might be supplemented by CT-Scan or MRI techniques, classical bimanual examination and vaginal ultrasound scan will determine the diagnosis in most cases comparably accurate. The suspected diagnosis concerning benign or malignant lesions, should take the palpable and sonographic feature, as well as the information from the patients medical history (e.g. family history of malignant diseases (BRCA 1/2 mutations) into account. In this regard, there are no other additional parameters established. Serum tumormarkers (CA 12.5) or sonographic examinations (including Doppler) have low sensitivity and specificity. Clinical diagnostic experience seems to be crucial. Cystic lesions mostly occur in premenopausal women and commonly relapse. They are mostly normal follicle cysts, but may also be a tumor of low malignant potential (LMP-tumor) or even an invasive cancerous lesion. 20-30% of all ovarian tumors are malignant and by the time of primary diagnosis already in a about 60-70% incurable due to intraabdominal dissemination. Benign or malignant lesions may occur in every age group. Ovarian tumors at infantile age are malignant in about 15%. Most malignant tumors occur between the age of 50 to 70. The LMP-tumors occur in average 10 years earlier. Malignant ovarian lesions represent about 15-30% of all genital malignant tumors. Hormonal contraceptives, pregnancy and breast feeding seem to be protective. The persistence of ovarian cysts and tumors will be mostly examined by laparoscopic surgery. In that respect the diagnosis of LMP-tumors might be incidentally and will then have a substantial impact on the extent of the surgery and the follow up. This compilation overviews the spectrum of benign and low malignant potential tumors of the ovary and their different tissues of origin."

In early-stage cervical cancer during the first and at the beginning of the second trimester, the two main considerations for management of the patient are the tumour size (and stage) and nodal staging. MRI and laparoscopic lymphadenectomy are useful for clinicians planning a potentially conservative approach. The management of patients with locally advanced cervical disease is controversial and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis according to the tumour size, radiological findings, the term of pregnancy, and the patient's wishes. Different histological types of malignant ovarian diseases arise during pregnancy and their management depends on the diagnosis (histological subtypes, tumour differentiation, and nodal status), the tumour stage, and the trimester of the pregnancy. In patients with peritoneal spread or high-risk early-stage disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with pregnancy preservation could be appropriate."

High-scoring lesions (10-14) are often malignant, therefore in situ needle aspiration of such lesions is not recommended. The aim of our study was to correlate the results of TVS characterization of ovarian and adnexal cysts with the aspiration cytologic evaluation. Twenty-three of the 43 cysts studied were aspirated in situ from the patient; 20 were aspirated from resected surgical specimens. Thirty-six benign cysts had TVS scores ranging from 4 to 12, with a median score of 7. All 25 cysts that were benign by TVS and/or histology were also cytologically benign as well as an additional 11 cysts that were not resected (TVS scores: 4 to 9). Seven cytologically and histologically malignant cysts had high TVS scores (TVS scores 10-14; median = 12). The combination of TVS and needle aspiration cytology is valuable, particularly in the diagnosis of cysts having low or intermediate TVS scores and benign cytology. Aspiration of cysts or masses with high TVS scores is not recommended. This combined evaluation may allow a more limited surgical approach, such as operative laparoscopy, or, in some cases, obviate the need for operative treatment altogether."

The pelviscopic procedures were primarily organ preserving operations associated with minimally invasive surgery, for example: Ovariolysis, ovarian cyst enucleation, coagulation of ovarian endometriotic implants, follicle puncture, parovarian cyst enucleation and, salpingo-oophorectomy. Laparotomy was indicated in the case of malignant disease, borderline tumors, large tumors, extensive adhesiolysis status post previous laparotomy, and in one case uncontrollable bleeding. The results show that today most procedures on the ovary can be performed per pelviscopy. In order to prevent a pelviscopic intervention in suspicious cases, the indication for laparotomy here must be generously applied."

CD009786,0,8821245,0,The role of laparoscopic surgery in gynaecological oncology.,"Minimal access surgery is here to stay in gynaecological oncology. Within the last three years, rapid strides have been made in applying minimal access surgical techniques to a wide range of gynaecological oncology procedures. The re-assessment of radical vaginal surgery has come largely because of the ease of accessing the pelvic lymph nodes using retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal techniques. An ability to assess the lymph nodes of the pelvis and the para-aortic region prior to definitive therapy is making management of many oncological conditions more logical. Question marks still arise over the place of minimal access surgery in ovarian cancer. A recent study by Professor Gunther Kinderman (Munich) in which, following a postal questionnaire, he identified an unacceptably high rate of laparoscopic interventions in invasive cancer with a parallel unacceptably high rate of metastatic disease, particularly in the port sites, has demonstrated a need for constant vigilance and careful assessment of the application of minimal access surgery in certain areas of oncology. Even while this chapter was in press, Professor Daniel Dargent has shown the possibility of carrying out assessment laparoscopically of the groin lymph nodes using a combination of minimal access surgery and plastic surgical techniques to remove fat. This technique when applied to sentinel node identification may revolutionize our assessment of the groin. Clearly this is an exciting time in gynaecological oncology and many and new inventive applications are being visualized by surgeons throughout the world. When this chapter is rewritten in two years time, inevitably, a considerable part of it will be altered. A glimpse of the future has been seen and we await the full vision with bated breath."
CD009786,0,8821246,0,Laparoscopic pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy.,"A systematic approach to the laparoscopic management of gynaecological malignancies began about 5 years ago more or less simultaneously in a few centres in France and the USA. Mature data and long-term follow-up are not yet available. Despite the absence of comparative studies, evidence is, in this author's opinion, now compelling that pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy can be carried out just as effectively laparoscopically as via a laparotomy. This conclusion is based on traditional surgical, anatomical and pathological considerations such as the way in which the operation is executed, photodocumentation of the extensiveness of the dissection, the lymph node harvest and the proportion of positive lymph nodes recovered. The benefits of a laparoscopic approach have yet to be demonstrated in comparative studies, but compared with historical controls, the reduction in morbidity is so dramatic as to leave little doubt that patients benefit from laparoscopic treatment in experienced hands."

CD009786,0,10459063,0,Laparoscopic management of benign ovarian disease.,"There was little controversy in the management of ovarian cysts until 15 years ago when operative endoscopy gained popularity. Before this time, laparotomy was the standard form of treatment for pelvic masses. Simple cysts were treated laproscopically by aspiration and solid or large tumors with any malignant potential by laparotomy. Constantly improving technology and instrumentation has allowed more and more operations to be performed laparoscopically. The gynecological oncologist has been wary of adopting this form of surgery for potential gynecological malignancies because of the safety and efficacy issues. Pelvic pathology, particularly ovarian tumors, pose a difficult problem. Apart from difficulty in screening, it is also difficult to confirm the nature of an ovarian pathology using the currently available investigative modalities. If the nature of an ovarian cyst can be ascertained beyond doubt, then the treatment can be simple, laparoscopy for benign and laparotomy for malignant. Having said that, more enthusiastic operative laparoscopists are using this approach to treat gynecological malignancies. We discuss the role of laparoscopy in the management of ovarian cysts."

Epithelial cancer of the ovary was only 25% as common among those who had ever taken oral contraceptives as those who had never done so (95% confidence interval 8% to 67%). There was little evidence of any important association between use of oral contraceptives and benign teratoma or cystadenoma. Functional cysts of the ovary occurred much less commonly in women who had recently (in the six months preceding diagnosis) taken combined oral contraceptives (but not in those who had taken progestogen only oral contraceptives) than in those who had never taken oral contraceptives or had taken them in the past. This protective effect was more pronounced for corpus luteum cysts (78% reduction; 95% confidence interval 47% to 93%) than for follicular cysts (49% reduction; 95% confidence interval 20% to 70%). It is estimated that about 28 (95% confidence interval 16 to 35) operations for functional ovarian cysts are avoided among every 100,000 women who take oral contraceptives each year."
CD009786,0,8747403,0,Office laparoscopy as a screening tool for early detection of ovarian cancer.,"Laparoscopy is a safe and effective surgical procedures used in evaluating the peritoneal cavity. Laparoscopy, under local anesthesia, has been well documented in the literature. These studies support the concept that laparoscopy can be performed under local anesthesia. Several small studies have addressed the respiratory, cardiac, and hemodynamic changes observed using local anesthesia and suggest that, with proper monitoring, these procedures can be safely performed in an outpatient setting. Optical catheter systems now have diameters ranging from 0.25 mm to 2.5 cm. Image fibers 6 microns in diameter are combined in bundles. The catheter system produces a brighter though grainier picture than views produced by a xenon light source and a 5 mm laparoscope. An Adair Verres needle (18 gauge) is inserted through a 3 mm plastic introducer. The Adair Verres needle is removed and a gas extension tube is used to create a pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide. The optical catheter is placed through the extension tube. If a second site is required for biopsy or washings, a 3 mm port can be inserted under direct visualization. Miniature ultrasound transducers have now been developed as a means of imaging the internal structures of the ovary. These transducers, housed in #3.5-6.2 French catheters, can be passed through a laparoscope, adding a new dimension to laparoscopy. Although the technology of office laparoscopy as a means of detecting early ovarian cancer exists, it has limited applicability for screening the population at large. It may be more useful as secondary or tertiary testing in the work-up of patients suspected of having ovarian cancer."

A 25-year-old woman in her 11th week of pregnancy had acute severe left lower-abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as left ovarian teratoma with torsion. She underwent emergency laparoscopic surgery with unwinding of the twisted fallopian tube and ovary and cystectomy of the teratoma.

The most common of these tumors--serous papillary carcinoma--is generally asymptomatic in the early stages. Non serous carcinomas (endometrioid and clear-cell carcinomas) have a higher chance of early diagnosis, as the associated endometriosis can cause pelvic pain, while endometrial hyperplasia/neoplasia can lead to vaginal bleeding. In addition, serous papillary carcinomas tend to be bilateral with peritoneal involvement, while non serous papillary carcinomas are often unilateral. Non serous papillary carcinomas tend to occur in younger, hyperestrogenic, often infertile patients. Serous papillary carcinomas potentially arise from dysplastic epithelial cells lining the ovarian surface and inclusion cysts, while the substrate of non serous papillary tumors is atypical endometriotic tissue.

The sonographic criteria for the diagnosis of endometriomata were (1) cystic structure with low, homogeneous echogenicity and (2) thick cystic wall with regular margins. In 50 patients, sonography suggested an endometrioma. In 47 cases, the diagnosis was correct. The false-positive cases were all caused by cystic teratomas with a homogeneous sonographic pattern. Ten false-negative cases were diagnosed by ultra-sonography as functional ovarian cysts (5), teratomas (3), and benign ovarian cystoma (1).

Despite many controversial views regarding its safety, aspiration cytology has been accepted as an innocuous procedure that can be accomplished with minimal discomfort or complications and, in association with laparoscopy, assist in the management of ovarian cysts and masses. Although FNA cannot be considered the first-hand diagnostic procedure for ovarian cancer in postmenopausal patients, it may be extremely helpful in young women, even during pregnancy, to safely differentiate functional and other benign ovarian cysts from malignant ones. In postmenopausal women, especially those in the high risk group for surgical procedures and those undergoing a ""second look"" intervention following radiation or chemotherapy, aspiration cytology may provide sufficient information to warrant abandoning unnecessary surgery. During laparotomy for suspected unilateral disease, FNA may provide sufficient data about the opposite ovary to allow that organ to remain in place, thus preserving its function in a young patient. The pathologist must be familiar with the cytology of normal pelvic structures and the diagnostic criteria used to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, as well as potential diagnostic pitfalls, such as interpretation based on very few cells or the absence of appropriate clinical information. Although proper classification of ovarian masses can be achieved through FNA, the pathologist should be aware of its limitations, such as difficulties in differentiating adenomas from non-neoplastic cysts, and tumors of low malignant potential from well-differentiated carcinomas. Descriptive histologic terminology should be applied, and terms such as ""suspicious"" or ""atypical"" avoided. The aspirated material may not only be used for the diagnosis and classification of ovarian neoplasms, it may also be used for DNA analysis, detection of estrogen receptors and other prognostic markers, thus providing information regarding biologic behavior of the tumors. Finally, it is hoped that aspiration of ovarian lesions routinely detected by sonography, in elderly women or those with a strong family history of ovarian cancer, will allow the physician to accomplish detection of early ovarian cancer."
CD009786,0,2423378,0,CA-125 levels in endometriosis.,"CA-125 is a cellular antigen detected in many patients with ovarian cancer, but it has also been detected in patients with endometriosis. Preoperative CA-125 levels were drawn from 113 patients before they underwent laparoscopy. Patients were categorized into diagnostic groups on the basis of pathologic findings. CA-125 levels in patients with evidence of intraabdominal adhesions were not statistically different from those in patients with normal pelvic anatomy. However, patients with advanced endometriosis had significantly elevated levels of CA-125 when compared with patients with normal pelvic anatomy (P less than 0.05). The clinical and immunologic implications of elevated CA-125 levels in patients with advanced endometriosis are discussed."
CD009786,0,8849961,0,Current status of staging laparotomy in colorectal and ovarian cancer.,"Colon and rectal carcinomas. Accurate staging of colon and rectal carcinomas (CRCs) is vital to insure appropriate surgical and adjuvant therapy, and appropriate enrollment in and interpretation of adjuvant or neoadjuvant trials. Historically, CRC staging has relied on pathologic examination of surgical speciments. These newer techniques of endoscopic and intraoperative ultrasound, laparoscopy, and radioimmunoguided surgery may permit increased accuracy of staging by the surgeon. Cautious interpretation of investigations of these modalities is warranted, as studies include small numbers of patients and some of the work is preliminary. Despite this, we remain optimistic that as surgeons become more familiar with these techniques and as these modalities become more widely available, more accurate staging will facilitate optimal patient management in terms of complete resection of occult disease and appropriate adjuvant therapy. Ovarian carcinoma. The survival of patients with ovarian cancer has not appreciably changed in the past several decades. There are several reasons for this, some of which are related to the surgical procedures used to diagnose and treat these cancers. First, despite a great deal of literature that suggests an elevated CA-125 level in a postmenopausal woman with a pelvic mass is virtually diagnostic of ovarian carcinoma, an unexceptably large number of patients are still explored in community hospitals by a surgeon or obstetrician-gynecologist who is not prepared or adequately trained to perform the aggressive cytoreductive surgery that the patients require. Similarly, a large percentage of patients with ""apparent"" early ovarian cancer are not fully surgically staged at their initial surgery and often require reoperation to accurately define the extent of their disease, which will then determine the need for adjuvant therapy. Despite ongoing health care reforms, these patients should be referred to centers where the appropriate surgical procedure can be performed by an experienced gynecologic oncologist. Second-look laparotomy (SLL) has become more and more controversial, mainly because of a lack of effective second-line therapy, and should not be performed unless the patient fully understands its limitations and is willing preoperatively to participate in a subsequent trial based on the operative findings. Laparoscopy, both in the initial staging surgery and at reassessment laparotomy (SLL), is being re-evaluated but should be considered experimental until definitive trials determine its role."

Recent data showed that following the SEE FIM protocol it is possible to evidence more fimbriae cancers. Due to those studies, fallopian tube cancer in recent years has become the predominant site of cancer in BRCA1 and/or 2 mutation carriers.

In vitro and in vivo studies of cell lines immortalized with human papillomavirus DNA are described with a discussion of the mechanism of the development of malignancy. An animal model to test and develop an anti-human papillomavirus vaccine is presented. The epidemiology of adenocarcinoma is also reviewed, and the development of invasive carcinoma after conservative therapy or conization for dysplasia is discussed. Computed tomography scanning has been found to be no more accurate than examination for staging of early cervical cancer. Several studies in the review period have evaluated risk factors for recurrent disease in patients treated for early-stage cervical cancer, including a prospective surgical pathologic study by the Gynecologic Oncology Group. The optimal treatment of early stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix is discussed, comparing the efficacy of primary surgical therapy with the efficacy of radiation therapy. The risk of ovarian metastases in patients with early-stage cervical cancer is very low for both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma. The surgical technique and efficacy of laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy for patients with early-stage cervical cancer are discussed. Lateral transposition of the ovaries at the time of radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer has significant potential benefits but also risks. Finally, surveillance methods that detect recurrent cervical cancer after treatment for early-stage disease are discussed."

Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is an emerging concept with potential advantages for patient recovery. The first case of clinical diagnostic application of transvaginal NOTES for diagnostic cancer staging is presented. Informed consent and Institutional Commission approval were obtained for transvaginal clinical trials. On February 28, 2007, a patient with elective surgical indication for diagnostic cancer staging was submitted to transvaginal NOTES procedure, and intra- and postoperative parameters were documented. In a 50-year-old female patient presenting with ascitis, diffuse abdominal pain, and weight loss for 2 months, diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis was suspected, which was also found when a CT scan was performed. Transvaginal NOTES was used for diagnostic staging of the patient, using a colonoscope introduced into the abdomen through a small incision in the vagina. Biopsies of liver, diaphragm, ovaries, and peritoneum were successfully performed. Operative time was 105 min, vaginal access and closure was obtained in 15 min. Abdominal inventory was reliable, and all 16 biopsies taken were positive for ovarian adenocarcinoma. The patient was dismissed 48 hours after the procedure without complications. Recent literature and experience of the study group suggest possibilities for preliminary clinical applications by transvaginal natural orifice surgery for diagnostic purposes."

CD009786,0,15516851,0,Peritoneal carcinoma in women with genetic susceptibility: implications for Jewish populations.,"Women from families with multiple cases of breast and ovarian cancer, specifically those who carry cancer-associated mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 are at increased life-time risk for peritoneal carcinoma, even after previous surgery to remove the ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus. Hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and the associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are particularly prevalent in women of Jewish lineage, and specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations have been linked with peritoneal carcinoma and HBOC syndrome in Jewish populations, especially those of Ashkenazi descent. This review presents the currently available data and looks forward toward further and better understanding of peritoneal carcinoma in women with inherited susceptibility. Over 90% of peritoneal cancer in patients from HBOC syndrome kindreds and associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are serous carcinomas, which is equivalent with the proportion of ovarian cancers that are serous carcinomas in similar patients. The best indications are that while many peritoneal carcinomas in genetically susceptible women may arise directly from malignant transformation of the peritoneum, others might represent metastases from primary ovarian or fallopian tube carcinomas. Although the incidence of borderline ovarian tumors may not be increased in HBOC syndrome kindreds and those who carry cancer-associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, these individuals could be susceptible to malignant transformation of borderline lesions of the ovaries and peritoneum. Moreover, recent reports raise the question of possibly increased risk in Jewish carriers of germline BRCA1 mutations for uterine papillary serous carcinoma, which could be the source of metastasis to the peritoneum in some cases. The penetrance of cancer-associated BRCA1 mutations for ovarian cancer is estimated to be 11%-54%, and for BRCA2 mutations the penetrance for ovarian cancer is 11%-23%. So far, available screening methods appear to be insufficient for early detection of many ovarian cancers. Prophylactic oophorectomy has been found to reduce the risk for ovarian cancer in women from HBOC kindreds and those who carry cancer-associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, leaving a residual risk for peritoneal carcinomatosis of well less than 5%. Therefore, surgical removal of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus, after child-bearing has been completed and by early in the fifth decade of life, are appropriate prophylactic procedures in women whose genetic susceptibility puts them at increased risk for cancers of mullerian tract origin, including ovarian and fallopian tube carcinomas and possibly serous carcinoma of the uterus. Hysterectomy, as well as salpingo-oophorectomy, removes the gynecologic organs targeted for malignant transformation in genetically susceptible women and simplifies decisions regarding hormone replacement therapy and chemical prophylaxis and treatment of breast cancer. Unless a transabdominal operative approach is otherwise indicated, laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal techniques are well suited for intra-abdominal exploration, cytology, biopsies and prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy in women with hereditary susceptibility to gynecologic cancer."
CD009786,0,17217498,0,Inguinal endometriosis attaching to the round ligament.,"We report a case of endometriosis in the right inguinal region, attached to the right round ligament in a 28-year-old woman. At the age of 20, laparoscopic left ovarian cystectomy and pelvic adhesiolysis for endometriosis was carried out. She noticed a right tender groin mass 7 months previously, and the tumour size fluctuated with the menstrual cycle. A poorly circumscribed elastic hard mass, measuring 3 cm in diameter, was palpated in her right inguinal region. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm mass in the right inguinal canal and a 5.4 cm x 6.8 cm mass was seen in the left ovary. The mass enlarged during menstruation. The groin mass was removed, in addition to carrying out laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. At operation, the groin mass was found to be in continuity with the round ligament of extraperitoneal portion. Histological diagnosis of endometriosis was made in both ovarian and inguinal tumours. After surgery, the pain disappeared completely. Worth mentioning is that MRI clearly showed the change of tumour size depending on the menstrual cycle, which aided in arriving at the correct diagnosis of endometriosis in an unusual location."

Owing to its high predictive value, laparoscopic surgery should be recommended for comprehensive diagnosis of small-size masses located in the small pelvis as possible early precursors of ovarian tumor; morphological verification of tumor process extent, and detection of preclinical recurrence of tumor in cases of failed non-invasive monitoring procedures such as ultrasound and CA-125 determination."

This has special relevance to the increasing possibilities of conservative management of adnexal tumours and cysts (puncturing or operating by laparoscopy). We reviewed sonographical and histological data of 514 patients, who were operated on in the 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Vienna because of pelvic masses. We correlated sonographical parameters like size of tumour, distinctness of margins, different kinds of internal echo pattern, papillary vegetation on the cystic wall or septa, with the defined histopathological diagnosis. A close relationship between size of tumour and tumour status could be found. The size of benign tumours was 7.1 cm. Malignant tumours had a size of 10.7 cm. The size of the high-echogenic area within the tumour, as well as its homogeneity, seemed to be of great importance. Such tumours with high-echogenic areas within, and especially those who had nonhomogeneous structures of these areas, proved to be malignant in 81% of the cases. Similarly, we found a close correlation of papillary vegetation either on cystic walls or on septa with the confirmed diagnosis of malignancy. Septa without papillarities or changing of their thickness were less important. By means of using our criteria a less experienced sonographic examiner could reach as good results as an experienced one in predicting malignancy."

CD009786,0,8736725,0,Sterilization.,"Sterilization is accepted as a permanent method of contraception by many couples in the world. Female sterilization is more widely used than male sterilization, but the latter is used by many couples in developed countries. The most widely used methods for female sterilization are simple tubal ligation, electrocautery of the fallopian tubes, and occlusion of the tubes by Hulka or Filshie clips or Falope rings. These procedures may be carried out either by minilaparotomy or by laparoscopy, under local anaesthesia. Sterilization may be performed immediately following pregnancy, or as an interval operation. The effectiveness of female sterilization is high, with failure rates of about 1-2 per 1000 procedures. Immediate complications are few and minor, while there appear to be no serious, long-term adverse effects. It is possible that there is a protective effect against ovarian cancer. Potential new technologies for female sterilization include the use of chemicals, such as quinacrine, for transcervical tubal occlusion, and hysteroscopic methods. Male sterilization is more simple and can readily be performed under local anaesthesia. A new technique originating in China, the no-scalpel technique, has made the procedure even more simple and produces fewer complications such as haematoma. It is possible that the direct injection of plug-forming material into the vas may render the procedure more reversible. Concerns about possible adverse effects of vasectomy on cardiovascular diseases and testicular cancer largely have been dispelled, but a possible weak association between vasectomy and prostatic cancer continues to be studied."

This was done to take advantage of the cellular and molecular synergism between paclitaxel and DNA-damaging agents, with the hope of avoiding paclitaxel-cisplatin toxicities. Paclitaxel was given as a 24-hr CIVI, after which cyclophosphamide was given as a 60-min infusion. Cycles of therapy were repeated every 3 weeks; and granulocyte colony-simulating factor (G-CSF) was given in a ""flexible"" dosing fashion. Starting doses were 170 mg/m2 paclitaxel and 750 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was seen at the doses of 250 mg/m2 paclitaxel and 1250 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide. DLT was cumulative thrombocytopenia. There were six nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicities experienced in the study. Eleven of 20 evaluable patients (55%) have achieved an objective response (4 CCR;7 PR). Three of four CCRs were confirmed by negative findings at peritoneoscopy. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1-4) and 17 individuals had platinum-refractory disease. We conclude that paclitaxel followed by cyclophosphamide is an active combination in recurrent ovarian cancer and that further study is needed to determine if this combination is truly better than paclitaxel alone."

CD009786,0,11155944,0,Reproduction post-chemotherapy in young cancer patients.,"High-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy has increased long-term survival of young patients with cancer. Sometimes however, the price paid is ovarian failure and sterility. It is highly important to detect who are the patients at risk in order to verify when fertility preservation is indicated. With conventional chemotherapy, there is significant differences in ovarian failure rate according to patients age, disease for which patients are treated for, and the drugs used. Bone marrow transplantation in cancer patients almost invariably induced ovarian failure, irrespective of patient age, treatment protocol or administration of hormonal treatment. Moreover, normal reproductive parameters post-chemotherapy does not necessarily imply that the ovaries escaped damage; ovarian injury is not an all or none phenomenon--partial loss of primordial follicle reserve can result in premature menopause as a delayed reaction to treatment. This should be taken into account while consulting former cancer patients about future planed pregnancies. The direct mechanisms of chemotherapy induced ovarian failure are poorly understood. An in vitro study has demonstrated that in the human ovary chemotherapy acts primarily on primordial follicles through induction of apoptotic changes in pregranulosa cells which lead to follicle loss. Protecting fertility potential in females exposed to chemotherapy with IVF and embryo cryopreservation or cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is practiced. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation: A recent study has demonstrated that laparoscopic ovarian biopsy performed with the round biopter is a safe and efficient method for collecting ovarian tissue for cryopreservation in cancer patients. In order to avoid possible hazards of transferring malignant cells, genetic and immunohistochemical markers for detection of minimal residual cancer cells in ovarian tissue are currently used. However, the reproductive potential of this method is still questionable. IVF: IVF and embryocryopreservation is currently used in infertile patients, however, several obstacles prevent it's wide implementation in cancer patients such as the need for male partner and the time needed for ovarian stimulation. A highly important issue is the possible risk of performing IVF and embryo cryopreservation to preserve fertility in females already exposed to chemotherapy. An animal study has raised serious concerns regarding the consequences of chemotherapy on future pregnancies. High abortion and malformation rates related to the different stages of oocyte maturation at the time of exposure to chemotherapy were demonstrated. These results should be taken into account when considering the use of IVF and embryo cryopreservation following chemotherapy treatment in cancer patients."

CD009786,0,21158324,0,Handling ovarian cancer FIGO III-IV : evolution over the last 30 years.,"The treatment of ovarian cancer FIGO III-IV has undergone substantial changes in the last 30 years. As I was involved as an oncological surgeon in the treatment of these patients since 1979 and made my PhD thesis on this subject, I consider myself a privileged witness of this evolution. In the late 1970's two major changes took place: the introduction of combination chemotherapy containing cisplatin and the concept of debulking surgery. In 1980 we embarked on an ambitious treatment plan combining maximal cytoreductive surgery, 6 cycles of chemotherapy, second look laparotomy and panabdominal irradiation. The results were analyzed in 1991 and gave rise to the following changes. Surgical cytoreduction could only be considered optimal if no residual tumor was left and residual tumor correlated with median survival. Upfront surgery was abandoned in FIGO IV and FIGO III with a very high tumor load. Panabdominal irradiation was too toxic. A recent randomized study has established equivalency of survival in FIGO IIIc between interval debulking after 3 cycles and upfront surgery. Initial tumor load remains a determinant of long- term cure and optimal upfront surgery is critical in patients with a metastatic tumor load of less than 100 gram. Retroperitoneal node dissection becomes important when complete resection of peritoneal metastases can be obtained. In experienced hands selection for primary debulking or for interval debulking seems possible at laparoscopic exploration."

Motion artifacts were reduced on breath-hold FR-FSE (3.8:3.2 = breath-hold FSE:nonbreath-hold FSE, P < 0.01) and image quality was comparable (3.8:3.7, NS). In all patients, pathology (leiomyoma [N = 26], adenomyosis [N = 10], endometrial carcinoma [N = 8], and ovarian cystic lesions [N = 21]) was recognized with comparable lesion conspicuity (3.8:3.7, NS) and better delineation of the structures (3.9:3.6, P < 0.05) on the FR-FSE images. There was no significant difference in contrast ratios, although SNRs (e.g., myometrium 18.3:25.8, P < 0.01) were better and the uterine zonal anatomy was recognized better on the nonbreath-hold FSE (3.4:3.7, P < 0.05). These differences did not affect the diagnosis. Breath-hold FR-FSE provides the benefits of motionless imaging and a short examination time, although lower SNRs were noted. J. Magn. Reson.

CD009786,0,17848329,0,Management of large cystic adnexal tumor by gasless laparoscopic-assisted surgery with wound retractor.,"We used a retrospective analysis to evaluate the efficacy of a wound retractor used in gasless laparoscopic-assisted surgery by the subcutaneous abdominal wall-lift method for the management of large cystic adnexal tumors. In the department of gynecology at a general hospital, 39 patients with large cystic adnexal tumors with an excised tissue weight including cystic contents exceeding 1000 g were treated by gasless laparoscopic-assisted surgery with a wound retractor from January 2001 through December 2006. Intervention was with a gasless laparoscopic-assisted adnexal surgery with a wound retractor. The median age of the patients was 51.5 years (range 16-79 years). The median weight of the excised tissue including cystic contents was 1857 g (range 1044-9454 g). The median blood loss was 30 mL (range 10-570 mL). The median surgical duration was 62 minutes (range 26-107 minutes). There were no major surgical complications. Histopathologic diagnosis of the excised tumor was mucinous cystadenoma, 18 cases; serous cystadenoma, 8 cases; mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of low-grade malignancy, 5 cases; dermoid cyst, 4 cases; paraovarian cyst, 2 cases; endometriotic cyst, 1 case; and clear cell adenocarcinoma, 1 case. Bilateral adnexal tumors were noted in 3 cases. We determined that gasless laparoscopic-assisted adnexal surgery with a wound retractor is an effective, minimally invasive procedure to treat large cystic adnexal tumors."

CD009786,0,2941187,0,Gonadal and adrenal androgen secretion in hirsute females.,"The pathophysiology of glandular androgen hypersecretion must be regarded as a continuous process without sharp borderlines from normal to non-tumorous conditions, such as polycystic ovaries and hyperthecosis, to neoplastic disease. Hirsutism and related symptoms are most often caused by excess androgens of ovarian and/or adrenal origin, i.e. testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, delta 4-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulphate. As demonstrated by selective catheterization of glandular effluents, combined hypersecretion occurs more frequently then either purely gonadal or adrenal overproduction. No correlation can be found between the type, frequency and extent of hormonal changes and the clinical, laparoscopic, angiographic, or histological findings. Dynamic function tests do not reliably discriminate between the various aetiological subgroups due to extremely variable and even non-specific individual responsiveness. Selective catheterization is presently the most sensitive method for the preoperative identification and localization of androgen-secreting neoplasms."
CD009786,0,15064540,0,[Surgical treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer].,Primary cytoreductive surgery remains the standard care in advanced ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery is defined as a residual tumor load less than 1 cm. after operation. The randomized clinical trials showed that interval debulking surgery improved survival in patients who did not undergo optimal primary debulking surgery. The retrospective trials have suggested that the outcome for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is the same as for patients treated with primary debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy should not to be used for clinical practice until the randomized clinical trial carried out by Gynecological Cancer Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and National Cancer Institute of Canada answers this question. There are no data from randomized trials to show the survival advantage in patients who received second-look operation as compared to those who did not.

We report a case of a 54-year-old woman with amenorrhea and hirsutism of abrupt onset and mild signs of virilization that had an adrenal incidentaloma coexisting with ovarian hyperthecosis. Basal total and free testosterone were 191 ng/dL and 179 pmol/L. Pelvic ultrasonography disclosed a right ovary with 10.3 cc and a left ovary with 9.8 cc without nodules or cysts, and computerized tomography of the abdomen disclosed a normal right adrenal gland. On the left adrenal gland a solid nodule with 0.8 cm was seen. After GnRHa administration, total testosterone was 23 ng/dL and free testosterone was 17 pmol/L. In view of a suppression of testosterone by GnRHa, the patient was submitted to a hystero-oophorectomy by laparoscopy. Symmetrically enlarged ovaries were seen. No tumor was apparent. Histology showed hyperthecosis, with foci of luteinized stromal cells. Only atretic follicles were detected. No hilar cell hyperplasia was seen. In conclusion, the presence of an adrenal mass in a hirsute woman can lead to a wrong diagnosis. In this case the suppression GnRHa test was fundamental to determine the origin of hyperandrogenemia."

All these uses of TVUS of the ovary will be discussed in this article."
CD009786,0,161766,0,"[The evolution of the indications for laparoscopy between 1973 and 1977. 1,758 cases (author's transl)].","In order to avoid the misuse of laparoscopy by an unnecessary increase in the indications for the procedure the authors have reviewed the evolution of these indications in the five years between 1973 and 1977. Certain indications have stayed stable, such as chronic pain in the pelvis, masses found in the pelvis, symptoms suggestive of upper genital tract infection or of ectopic pregnancy and tubal or unexplained sterility. Stability in these indications is correct because laparoscopy and laparoscopy alone can give a precise diagnosis of the lesion and complete the clinical findings and the other methods of investigation. There are two indications which have become less frequent and these are: ovarian sterility and amenorrhoea. This is logical since more reliance has come to be placed on biological methods. Laparoscopy should be reserved in these conditions for cases where are contradictions between biological findings or where there are therapeutic failures. An increase in the indications which is very justified is in those laparoscopies which are carried out as a control of the results of tubal surgery, because there a prognosis can be given and therapy can be carried out (such as division of adhesions) and in cases of malignant tumours of the ovary which, although the procedure will give less precise information than laparotomy, has the advantage that it can be repeated from time to time."

D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC). Microscopically, all tumors had marked epithelial proliferation with abundant eosinophilic cells, and eight had intraluminal mucin. Multiple areas of microinvasion were found in eight cases. Additional unusual features were found in three cases. One patient presented with a serous LMP tumor in a supraclavicular lymph node. After resection of an ovarian serous LMP tumor, she was treated with chemotherapy and is without evidence of disease after 21 years. One patient had tumor resected at 24 weeks of gestation and at 2 months postpartum. Marked regression of the epithelial proliferation, the number of eosinophilic cells, and the amount of mucin was seen in the second specimen. Another patient had multiple peritoneal nodules at cesarean section, one of which was biopsied and diagnosed as a primary serous LMP of the peritoneum with multiple areas of microinvasion. Two months later a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and no residual disease was found. All patients are alive with no evidence of disease. In summary, serous LMP tumors during pregnancy have microscopic and clinical features suggesting aggressive behavior; however, these features appear to regress at the termination of the pregnancy."

There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications and postoperative recovery was rapid with all patients having function of the colostomy within 24 h and regaining their preoperative state of mobility on the second postoperative day. The laparoscopic approach allows the careful selection of the colostomy site, easy mobilisation of the colon causing only little disruption to the intestinal function and hence, improving postoperative recovery. From our experience, laparoscopic colostomy is a simple and safe operation in most cases and can be used as the preferred technique of intestinal diversion.

All 3 patients underwent re-exploration within 3 weeks and were found to have tumoral spread and port site implantation of tumor. When ovarian cancer is removed laparoscopically, the potential exists for intra-abdominal tumoral spread.

The Groshong was easily inserted intraperitoneally in 20 ovarian cancer patients and used to deliver 81 courses of intraperitoneal therapy over 2310 patient-days. There were no catheter-related complications during treatment and only one exit site infection after catheter removal.

CD009786,0,9007148,0,The management of dermoid cysts--a comparative study of laparoscopy and laparotomy.,The aim of our study was to compare laparoscopy with laparotomy for the removal of ovarian dermoid cysts. Thirty-eight women with benign ovarian dermoid cyst were allocated for either laparoscopy (18 patients) or laparotomy (20 patients). The two groups were compared for operative and hospitalization times and postoperative course. Operating time was longer (93.6 +/- 23.8 min) and hospitalization time significantly shorter (22.4 +/- 6.6 h) in the laparoscopy group. No complications were reported in either group. We conclude that operative laparoscopy is a safe procedure for the removal of dermoid ovarian cysts and is as effective as laparotomy.

CD009786,0,1838758,0,[Rupture of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. Value of celioscopic surgery].,"The rupture of haemorrhagic cysts of the ovary occur frequently and are often missed. Review of the literature and an analysis of our series of 20 patients makes it possible to summarise the typical clinical picture, which is of a young woman who has sudden severe pelvic pain in the second half of her menstrual cycle, during intercourse, or when she has pelvic trauma. Ultrasound in 90% of cases shows up signs suggesting the diagnosis and these are: a mass beside the uterus, or an intra-abdominal effusion. Endoscopic surgery is indicated particularly in women of reproductive age who suffer this pathology which is always benign. The indications to treat the patients should always take in to account the histology; 100% of these are luteal cysts. There is no reported case of cancer of the ovary or of an organic haemorrhagic cyst. On the other hand occasionally a primary ovarian pregnancy may occur and that can be confused with a haemorrhagic cyst. Finally haemorrhagic cysts can occur with an intra-uterine pregnancy and this means that the corpus luteum must be preserved. We propose the following treatment for those cases with symptoms: simple peritoneal washout when pregnancy has been ruled out on the laparoscopy exploration and when the bleeding is widespread: systematic taking of a biopsy for histology if there is the slightest doubt that there is a pregnancy in the ovary and an intraperitoneal removal of the cyst when haemorrhage persists during the operation."

We present the case of a 34-year-old woman who was admitted with the acute onset of abdominal pain and distension. A pelvic sonogram showed a large amount of peritoneal fluid with echogenic material and a 10-cm complex cystic structure, which appeared to be an enlarged left ovary. The concentrations of CA125 and CA19-9 were 548.1 and 7604 IU/mL, respectively. On the second day of admission, an exploratory laparoscopy was performed, which revealed a ruptured left ovarian cyst consistent with an endometrioma. A laparoscopic left adnexectomy was therefore performed. The histological examination of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of an endometrioma. After a 12-month follow-up period, the patient showed no recurrence of the endometrioma or peritoneal fluid accumulation. In most instances, the presence of massive ascites is associated with malignancies, tuberculosis, or a perforated viscus. The information provided in the present report is important to both gynecologists and oncologists because it shows that an ovarian cyst with ascites and highly elevated CA125 and CA19-9 levels might be benign."
CD009786,0,7437381,0,Carcinoma of the ovary--correlation of ultrasound with second look laparotomy.,"In a series of twenty-six patients with Stage III or IV carcinoma of the ovary, results of ultrasound examination of the pelvis and abdomen were correlated with second look laparotomy. All of these patients had responded clinically to a course of chemotherapy. Elective surgery was used to restage and debulk tumour. Ultrasound examination was done before surgery. Ultrasound was sensitive in detecting ovarian tumour in the pelvis and had an 84 per cent correlation with laparotomy. It was also sensitive in detecting liver and right diaphragmatic metastases with a 92 per cent correlation with the laparotomy findings. However, it consistently failed to detect intraperitoneal spread except when disease was gross or when it could be predicted by the presence of ascites. The correlation with laparotomy in this situation was only 36 per cent. This is to be expected as the size of most peritoneal deposits is below the resolution of ultrasound. These lesions, however, are easily detected by laparoscopy. These findings suggest that ultrasound has an important role in the management of advanced carcinoma of the ovary."

CD009786,0,11319502,0,[Laparoscopic treatment of ovarian cysts in women over 40].,"Laparoscopy constitutes the main surgical method for treating benign ovarian pathology in women under 40 years of age. The discussion is about the possibility of extending this surgical method to patients over 40 in whom the risk of malignant ovarian pathology is either borderline or considerably higher. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic treatment for these patients, who have been submitted to adequate screening, comparing the results of echographic diagnosis, laparoscopy and histology."
CD009786,0,21806569,0,Laparoscopy or laparotomy for endometrial cancer? A review of three prospective randomised trials.,"The incidence of endometrial cancer is increasing throughout the world, and an appropriate safe and cost-effective surgical management is debated between traditional laparotomy and laparoscopy. Recently, three large prospective randomised controlled trials have been published comparing both modalities. The inclusion criteria for these studies are quite different, and whilst many of the outcomes reported are similar, some such as blood loss, complications, length of stay and quality of life (QoL) may have suffered as a result of selection bias. Some of these biases include differences in the stage of patients included, tumour grade, tumour histology, performance status, the requirement to undertake and complete surgical staging and the methodology of QoL assessment. An overall analysis of these studies shows that whilst there are advantages (and disadvantages) to both surgical approaches, overall there is no convincing evidence of the superiority of one surgical approach over the other. What is probably more important for the individual surgeon consenting a patient for surgery is to offer an approach consistent with good oncological outcomes."

Abdominal pain caused by isolated tubal torsion is extremely rare. In the report, we presented a case of isolated tubal torsion caused by benign serous cystadenoma. A 28-year-old married woman (G0) having lower abdominal pain and nausea was referred to our Emergency Room with suspicion of ovarian mass. Physical examination, transvaginal ultrasound and computed tomography showed a 4-cm right adnexal cystic mass. Other laboratory data were all within normal limits. She was managed by laparoscopic examination due to a lack of improvement in her clinical symptoms and inclusive diagnosis after 48-hours' conservative treatment. Laparoscopy showed isolated torsion of right fallopian tube but the right ovary was normal without torsion. Initially, detorsion was performed but necrotic change of the fallopian tube persisted because of permanent darkened color tube without blood flow redistribution, so salpingectomy was performed 30 minutes later. Final pathology showed benign serous cystadenoma of fallopian tube. The present case is the first case of benign serous cystadenoma with resultant necrotic tubal torsion. We reported this case to emphasize the possible value of early performance of laparoscopy in aiding an accurate diagnosis."

Because sonography was without pathological findings and the patient showed a sterility type, laparoscopy was indicated. Histological findings showed invasive growth of a tubulopapillary carcinoma. Laparotomy with hysterectomy, bilateral adnexa removal, omentectomy as well as pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was examined.

CD009786,0,10063270,0,T lymphocytes and cytokine production in ascitic fluid of ovarian malignancies.,"The activation status of T lymphocytes and the presence of various cytokines in ascitic fluid were examined to test peritoneal immunity in women with ovarian malignancies. Peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid were collected from 12 patients with primary ovarian cancer with ascites and 27 normal control subjects during laparoscopic examination. Lymphocyte subpopulations and the expression of activation markers on T lymphocytes were analyzed by dual-color flow cytometry. The concentrations of various cytokines and soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor-alpha were measured. CD8 T lymphocytes were the main component of peritoneal lymphocytes. CD69 and HLA-DR, but not CD25, were highly expressed on peritoneal T lymphocytes compared to those in peripheral blood. In ascitic fluid of ovarian malignancies, CD4 T lymphocyte concentrations were further decreased, resulting in a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio. Decreased expression of CD69 and CD25 was also noted on T lymphocytes from ascites compared with T lymphocytes in normal peritoneal fluid. IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and soluble IL-2 receptor-alpha concentrations were increased significantly in the ascitic fluid of women with ovarian cancer. The decrease in activation markers on T lymphocytes is suggestive of an immunosuppressive state, despite the presence of abundant stimulatory cytokines. The immunosuppression may be multifactorial, attributed, in part, to the increased concentrations of soluble IL-2 receptor-alpha and other inhibitors."

We report a case of bone formation within a mucinous cystadenoma of the ovary. A 19-year-old active duty female presented with an asymptomatic pelvic mass; sonographic imaging revealed a 5.7-cm complex right adnexal mass. A laparoscopic cystectomy was performed. Pathologic evaluation of the cyst revealed a mucinous cystadenoma. Contained within several of the thick fibrous septae were areas of well-formed bone. Although a benign finding, bone formation and associated fibrosis may lead to sonographic findings of concern during the evaluation of patients with a pelvic mass."
CD009786,0,16677839,0,[Feasibility and limits of laparoscopic treatment of borderline ovarian tumours].,"Borderline ovarian tumours (BOT) are mainly diagnosed in young women with early stage disease. Due to the absence of specific pre operative criteria for BOT, a laparoscopy is usually performed. A review of the literature found no pejorative data on laparoscopic approach for BOT. Strict surgical procedures must be performed to avoid incomplete surgical staging, cells dissemination and port-site metastases. The limits of the laparoscopic management are the stage of disease and the tumour size. Laparoscopic treatment of BOT for women with early stage disease is feasible. This treatment should be evaluated in specialized centres for women with advanced stage diseases and/or peritoneal implants."
CD009786,0,6448405,0,"[The management of ovarian adenocarcinoma. ""Second look"" surgical operation after chemotherapy (author's transl)].","Forty patients with adenocarcinoma of the ovary (including 34 in stages III and IV) underwent a ""second look"" surgical operation after a first course of chemotherapy. The operation, which carried negligible morbidity, demonstrated complete remission in 27,5% of the cases; whenever necessary and possible achieved complete remission by surgical excision; and helped in establishing a second course of chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy. This therapeutic strategy seems to have had overall favourable repercussions on the patients' short- and mid-term survical. Long-term results cannot yet be assessed, but the knowledge of late failures suggests that applying intensive chemotherapy or, preferably, chemo-immunotherapy after the ""second look"", or even reserving potent cytostatic drugs for that period, could be beneficial. From the very favourable survival rate in patients found on second look to have complete remission, one may conclude that surgically confirmed remission should be considered as the primary target of the initial treatment."
CD009786,0,10459057,0,Laparoscopic surgery of the fallopian tubes and ovaries.,"Operative laparoscopy can be used for many surgical procedures on the fallopian tube and ovary. These include: (1) tubal sterilization; (2) salpingectomy and salpingostomy for tubal pregnancy; (3) fimbrioplasty, salpingoneostomy, and linear salpingostomy for tubal obstruction and infertility; (4) microsurgical tubal reanastomosis for reversal of tubal sterilization; (5) oophorectomy, cystectomy, cyst drainage and fulguration, and excision of ovarian tumors; (6) wedge resection and ovarian drilling for polycystic ovaries; and (7) fulguration and laser vaporization for endometriosis. Many of these procedures are conservative and involve reconstruction of the tube and ovaries to preserve fertility. Microsurgical techniques are incorporated into such fertility sparing or enhancing procedures. Comparison of similar surgical procedures on the tube and ovaries indicates better or similar surgical outcome when done through the laparoscope rather than laparotomy; less blood loss, faster recovery, and cheaper cost are the hallmarks when the procedure is done by laparoscopy. With further improvement and expansion in laparoscopy equipment, it can be expected that more surgical procedures on the adnexa can be undertaken safely and effectively."

CD009786,0,8992817,0,[Laparoscopic para-aortic and pelvic lymph node excision--initial experiences and development of a technique].,"It was the aim of this study to establish and analyze the laparoscopic technique of para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy. During a one year period (from August 1994 till July 1995) 42 patients underwent pelvic and para-aortic laparoscopic lymphadenectomy. In 29 cases cervical cancer, in 11 cases endometrial cancer and in 2 cases tumors of low malignant potential of the ovary were the indication for lymphadenectomy which was combined with radical vaginal hysterectomy in 19 patients or simple vaginal hysterectomy in 13 patients. During the observation period the mean operating time for para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy decreased and the efficiency of the lymphadenectomy increased significantly: the mean operating time for the first 10 para-aortic lymphadenectomies was 52 minutes and for the pelvic lymphadenectomies 141 minutes, respectively. For the last 10 procedures the para-aortic part took 35 minutes and the pelvic part 110 minutes. Whereas at the beginning of the study a mean of 25 lymph nodes were removed, a mean of 36 lymph nodes were sampled during the last 10 procedures. In 3 patients operative injuries to major vessels were encountered of which two were followed by laparotomy. In 3 other patients laparotomy due to postoperative hemorrhage was necessary. These 6 complications occurred during the first half of the study and were not encountered during the following operations by changing from monopolar to bipolar coagulation and by modifying the regimen for perioperative thrombosis prophylaxis. In the first half of the study in 9 women blood transfusions were necessary and in the second half only 4 patients had to be transfused. In the first 10 patients the mean intraoperative blood loss was 1300 cc, in the last 10 patients 300 cc. After a short learning curve laparoscopic para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy is a safe and effective technique for staging cervical, endometrial, and early ovarian cancers. Though this technique is no standard procedure results of this pilot study warrant prospective studies comparing this technique with conventional procedures."
CD009786,0,4256596,0,Fibrin degradation products and ovarian tumours.,"Fibrin degradation products (F.D.P.) were determined in the serum of 163 women in whom ovarian tumours had been suspected on palpation at gynaecological examination and who were afterwards examined by laparoscopy or subjected to laparotomy. F.D.P. were found in the serum (0.5-30 mg/100 ml) of 23 (72%) out of 32 patients with malignant tumours. Of 131 patients with benign findings F.D.P. (traces to 2 mg/100 ml) were found in six (4.5%), and in most of these the occurrence of F.D.P. could be explained on other clinical grounds. The findings suggest that the examination of F.D.P. in suspected malignant ovarian tumour may be of diagnostic value.Determination of F.D.P. in malignant ascitic fluid showed very high values, ranging between 40 and 350 mg/ 100 ml. This argues for the occurrence of F.D.P. in the blood being due to an extravascular breakdown of fibrin caused by tumour cells, but they may also be due to thromboplastic and fibrinolytic agents from the tumour entering the blood stream."

CD009786,0,9263716,0,Laparoscopic management of gynecological malignancies.,"The primary surgical management of endometrial and cervical carcinoma requires four operations: simple and radical hysterectomy, and pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy. All these four operations can now be carried out laparoscopically with significant reduction in morbidity and among the patient population that develops these malignancies, namely, the elderly and the obese. Moreover, as judged by the number of nodes harvested and the proportion of positive nodes, the radicality of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy is equivalent to its 'open' counterpart. Thus, laparoscopic management is feasible in almost every patient who has carcinoma of the endometrium or cervix. Experience with the laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer is more limited. There has been concern that the increased frequency of cyst rupture makes laparoscopic management inappropriate, but cyst rupture per se does not impair survival provided patients are managed appropriately with adjuvant chemotherapy, and all but stage I, grade I ovarian cancer is treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Many patients who have stage II-IV disease can be satisfactorily 'debulked' laparoscopically, and a significant proportion of those who cannot be debulked primarily can be debulked laparoscopically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer promises to be the most active area of advance over the next few years."

A planned laparoscopic approach was successful in 95.2% (179/188) of patients. The majority of women were premenopausal (93.6%) and the most common procedure performed was an ovarian cystectomy (73.5% of cysts). Three ovarian cysts that were thought to be benign by preoperative and intraoperative assessment were subsequently found to be ovarian tumours of low malignant potential after histological examination. Operative laparoscopy has become the preferred mode of treatment for benign adnexal cysts at the Royal Women's Hospital. It confers a wide range of benefits to patients, reduces health-care costs and appears to be a safe and effective treatment modality."
CD009786,0,8851090,0,[Laparoscopy in (apparently) benign ovarian tumors between benefit and catastrophy and the deceptive safety of laparoscopic lap sacs].,"Endoscopic ovarian surgery is currently spreading tremendously, but also rather uncritically. The technical possibilities both of organ preserving and ablative endoscopic surgery are controversial, so that structuring of the indication for an endoscopic procedure as well as optimization of the endoscopic removal of ovarian tumor or adnexae is of utmost relevance. Therefore, a study was performed at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the Heidelberg University with the following aims: Risk evaluation of operating into an ovarian malignancy at endoscopy for ""presumably"" benign cystic ovarian tumors in n = 100 cases in Heidelberg and literature survey Analysis of problems and complications during clinical application of laparoscopic lap sacs for removal of cystic adnexal tumors or adnexae (n = 50) Experimental examination of the risk of an endoscopic lap sacs to rupture during a procedure The risk of endoscopically operating into an ovarian cancer lies between 0.4 and 3% according to literature data. Despite maximal preoperative selection, mainly by ultrasound examination, in our group of 100 patients, in three women without preoperative signs of malignancy but with discreet intracystic structures in the ultrasound, an endoscopic adnexectomy with complete removal in a lap sac was performed, and though immediate section for microscopic examination was negative, final histology revealed one ovarian cancer la and 2 borderline tumors, same stage. In the time period analyzed, three further patients were referred to our center for secondary, delayed (median 3 months) staging after endoscopic procedures for presumed benign lesions. Clinical application of lap sacs proved the necessity of an intensive training. In 3 patients an intraperitoneal rupture of the sac occurred. Typical problems were volume discrepancies between sac respectively abdominal incision and tissue to be removed (28% of cases). The risk of rupture of the various lap sacs examined differed significantly (p < 0.05). Due to the complex pathological nature of cystic adnexal tumors, a 100% selection for the endoscopic approach is not feasible. Therefore, an endoscopic procedure should only be performed after optimal preoperative diagnosis and, in case of the slightest doubt, only if intraoperative microscopic examination is available, and the possibility to perform an immediate staging laparotomy. Sufficient information of the patient is relevant. Laparoscopic removal of tumor or adnexae should be performed in a lap sac. However, there is no absolute certainty of preventing spillage even with the lap sac, since not all endoscopic sacs available are of a sufficient quality."

The study is concerned with a retrospective assessment of 358 patients. The first line of investigation was seen to be ultrasound which is effective in 91% of cases. When the level of CA-125 is above 35 U/ml that suggests that there may be a malignant neoplasm present. The test is sensitive to about 78.6% and specific at 76%. 96 cysts were considered to be benign using clinical and para-clinical examinations and were punctured under ultrasound control or laparoscopically. The cytology could not be interpreted in 15%. Only one borderline tumour of the ovary was found. 25.3% of cysts that had been aspirated recurred and this is a high figure. Given these figures, the authors suggest a diagnostic and therapeutic program for ovarian cysts."

Antitumour murine mAbs (HMFG1, HMFG2, H317, and H17E2) and the reshaped human antibody Hu2PLAP (against placental alkaline phosphatase; PLAP), labelled with indium-111 and iodine-123, were evaluated for their ability to localise ovarian tumours in sequential studies of our group. Thirty patients with ovarian cancer, aged 40-78 years (median 60 years) were studied with HMFG1/G2: 11, and H317/H17E2: 19 murine mAbs. Six patients with ovarian cancer aged between 36 and 65 years (median 49 years) were studied with the reshaped human Hu2PLAP mAb (5 patients) or the murine H17E2 mAb (2 patients) labelled with 111In via a new macrocyclic chelating agent (DOTA). One of these was imaged twice, with H17E2- and Hu2PLAP-DOTA-111In, respectively. In 20 out of 22 patients with radiologically measurable ovarian cancer, the presence of tumour was confirmed by the murine mAb scan and correlated well with the findings of conventional radiology diagnostic methods. One of these patients with a negative H17E2 scan and a large abdominal mass at laparotomy was found to have a PLAP-negative tumour on immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the antibody scan revealed the presence of active disease, confirmed at laparotomy/laparoscopy, in 6 out of 8 patients considered to be in clinical complete remission. Best images were obtained at 24 and 48 h after the 123I and 111In mAbs, respectively. Successful imaging with the reshaped human antibody, Hu2PLAP, was seen in 2 patients with PLAP-positive tumours. Antibodies to DOTA developed in 2 patients. In conclusion, immunolocalisation of ovarian tumours is feasible with both murine and reshaped human mAbs. The sensitivity and specificity of the method appear very high in this pilot study, and in view of the absence of toxicity, the diagnostic contribution of this approach should be evaluated prospectively. Given the low number of patients without surgically detectable disease in the present study, future investigations should include more patients with no evidence of disease in order to provide more meaningful estimates of specificity."

This risk can be minimized by paying particular attention to high-risk characteristics in any of the above assessment criteria and by obtaining an intraoperative frozen section if there is any suspicion of malignancy. The same approach should be used whether the initial treatment is by laparotomy or laparoscopy. We present a case of clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary in a 19-year-old woman where there was delay in diagnosis and treatment as a result of an incorrect initial histopathology assessment.

Explorative laparotomy confirmed the presence of papillary serous carcinoma in the omentum, surface of the left ovary and the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and established the diagnosis of PPSC. Following two cycles of postoperative chemotherapy, the patient is alive with no evidence of internal malignancy. However, although muscle strength and enzymes have remained normal, no effect on the skin manifestation of DM has been observed. This case illustrates that, alongside the more frequently occurring ovarian carcinoma, PPSC should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of the underlying malignancy that may occur in the female patient with DM."

CD009786,0,21413836,0,Laparoscopic second look operation for ovarian cancer: single center experiences.,"We compared the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic surgery with those of laparotomy in second-look operations for ovarian cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 35 patients treated between January 2000 and December 2005. They were categorized into two groups: Laparoscopy versus laparotomy group. Among 35 patients, 18 patients (51.4%) were treated with laparoscopy, and 17 patients (48.6%) were treated with laparotomy. There were no statistically significant differences except for hospital stay (laparoscopy vs. laparotomy five days vs. nine days, p < 0.05). Eight patients (44.4%) in the laparoscopy group and six (35.3%) in the laparotomy group were found to be pathologically positive after the second look operation. There were two recurrences (20.0%) in the laparoscopy group and four (36.4%) in the laparotomy group pathologically negative in the second-look operation (p = 0.557). There were no differences in disease-free survival rates (p = 0.705) between the two groups. The second look operation is an ideal method for histologic comfirmation of recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer. Laparoscopic surgery seems a safe and accurate method for the second-look examination, and can also reduce patient discomfort, hospital stay and morbidity associated with laparotomy."
CD009786,0,12854858,0,Ovarian tumour: ovarian pregnancy. Diagnosis and management.,"An ovarian mass in a premenopausal patient has many differential diagnoses. In young patients the mass is most likely to be benign. Sometimes patients with an abdominal mass will present as acute abdomen. If the patients have an IUD and a positive test for serum HCG, an ectopic ovarian pregnancy has to be suspected. However one also has to take into consideration the possibility of an ovarian germ cell tumour. The latter occurs in young patients, presents as an ovarian mass and can produce HCG. The preoperative and even intraoperative diagnosis are difficult. In these cases where there is a suspected ovarian mass and no clear diagnosis a laparoscopic approach should be considered. Patients with an ovarian pregnancy have a good prognosis for future fertility and therefore conservative surgical management is advocated. The approach and treatment modalities of an ovarian pregnancy are discussed."
CD009786,0,11098043,0,The management of mature cystic teratomas in children and adolescents: a retrospective analysis.,"Mature cystic teratomas (MCT) are the most common ovarian tumours seen in children and adolescents. Fifty-two patients <21 years of age had surgical removal of an MCT, 14 of whom were approached laparoscopically. Compared with laparotomy, those patients managed laparoscopically had a significantly shorter hospital stay. Intra-operative tumour spillage occurred in 27 (52%) patients; there were no cases of chemical peritonitis. Available follow-up data on 34 (65%) patients revealed seven pregnancies occurring at a median of 70 months (46-123) postoperatively, including four in patients with intraoperative MCT spill. There were no cases of tumour recurrence during the follow-up period among the 27 (52%) patients managed with ovarian cystectomy. These results demonstrate that some of the conclusions regarding the contemporary management of MCT in adults are applicable to children and adolescents."

The diagnosis is often delayed because of the non-specific nature of symptoms and a lack of specific and accurate diagnostic tests, that is, CA125 and ultrasound. In premenopausal women these issues are compounded, further reducing the likelihood of an accurate and early diagnosis. It is important for gynaecologists to have a high index of suspicion and appropriately investigate symptomatic patients and interpret test results critically. Not all ovarian cysts in young women are benign, and a low threshold for surgical evaluation is warranted."

Examining 194 own cases (1983-1993) it was 1.5%. We found one squamous cell carcinoma (0.5%). Additionally we found 2 immature teratomas (1%). We point out the different biological behaviour of malignant mature teratomas and immature teratomas. We agree with the majority of authors that the method of choice is the intact removal of all teratomas without iatrogen rupture or contamination of the abdominal cavity by contents of the teratoma. This adequate surgical procedure can and should be performed by laparotomy or laparoscopy with endobag. The often practised method of cutting open the cyst during laparoscopy, sucking off the contents or cutting the teratoma into pieces, has been proven to lead to implantation and worsening the prognosis in case of a malignant teratoma. Even the rinsing of the abdominal cavity, usually carried out with this method, could not compensate always for the disadvantage of this ""dirty"" endoscopical method compared with usual oncological standards. This is pointed out by case reports in the literature and the first analysis of a German survey with early-follow-up of 192 laparoscopically managed ovarian malignancies [11a]. The principle of intact removal of every teratoma should again be kept in mind."

It is characterised by the presence of polycystic ovaries on ultrasound examination together with clinical and biochemical signs of hyperandrogenaemia. The majority of patients will seek medical advice because of menstrual disturbances, infertility or signs of hyperandrogeneamia (hirsutism, acne, alopecia). In obese patients the therapeutic mainstay is weight reduction. Anovulatory infertility is treated by stimulation of ovulation, laparoscopic electrocautery or IVF, while patients with menstrual disturbances without a wish to conceive should be treated with cyclic gestagen therapy or oral contraceptives in order to reduce the increased life-long risk of endometrial cancer. Additionally, hirsutism may be treated by epilation or antiandrogen therapy. PCOS is a common disease with an increased risk of NIDDM, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and endometrial cancer.

They probably are a one-sided development of a teratoma, which arise from germ cells after the first meiotic division due to either a meiosis I or a meiosis II non dysjunction. Diagnosis is possible only with histological examination and immunohistochemistry which allow us to differentiate carcinoids from sex-cord tumors and ependymomas.

The direct samples were obtained during laparotomy or laparoscopy, following saline lavage if that was performed, and were immediately smeared on glass slides and fixed in 95% alcohol. Only 9 of the direct peritoneal samples taken from 64 patients with benign gynecologic disease were unsatisfactory for cytologic interpretation while 19 of the 33 lavage specimens simultaneously collected from these patients were considered unsuitable for analysis (P less than .001). Two direct smears from cases with benign histology were reported as suspicious. Nineteen patients with epithelial ovarian cancer also had cytologic specimens collected by direct sampling and by washing. The direct smears were positive for malignancy in 12 cases, suspicious in 4 cases and negative in 3 cases while the lavage samples were positive in 9 cases, suspicious in 4 cases, negative in 4 cases and unsatisfactory in 2 cases. These results indicate that direct peritoneal sampling is a simple and reliable alternative to peritoneal lavage and produces a significantly lower incidence of unsatisfactory specimens."

They are generally recognized either immediately or a few days after the operation. We present a case of laparoscopic perforation of the small intestine in a patient who had undergone previous pelvic surgery for an ovarian carcinoma. On ultrasound (US), the patient had multiple hepatic lesions resembling hepatic metastases. To confirm the diagnosis, laparoscopy with guided liver biopsy was performed on the grounds that this procedure is regarded as more appropriate than CT- or US-guided hepatic biopsy. Veress needle and trocar insertion were performed at a proper distance from the abdominal scar. However, the abdominal cavity was not visible after the trocar's insertion due to the unexpected presence of adhesions. This precluded the continuation of the procedure. In the following days, the patient experienced only mild abdominal discomfort. However, 2 weeks after laparoscopy, the patient presented signs of peritoneal reaction and underwent laparotomy. Adhesion-fixing jejunal loops to the anterior abdominal wall were discovered at the site of the trocar puncture. Moreover, two hiatuses of these loops were observed and sutured. The follow-up was uneventful. As this case illustrates, laparoscopic bowel injuries remain an unpredictable event. Recognition of this complication may occur several days after the procedure, as the tamponating effect of adhesions on the jejunal hiatus delays the involvement of the peritoneum."

A 28-year-old female patient exhibited intraperitoneal carcinomatosis after a laparoscopic surgery for ruptured mature teratoma of the ovary with occult malignant transformation. The complication was found two months after initial laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was smooth including oophorectomy, and removing all spilled specimens within the abdominal cavity. At the end of the laparoscopic surgery, cleaning the abdominal cavity and irritating the port site were also performed. Cytology of the abdominal cavity and all removed specimens did not show evidence of malignancy. She followed up regularly and uneventfully except for persistently abdominal fullness and erythematous change of umbilical portal site. Evidence demonstrated intestinal obstruction associated with ascites after a detailed evaluation. Although the patient received supportive treatment the symptom exacerbated. Therefore, the patient was treated with exploratory laparotomy. Pathology proved with intraperitoneal carcinomatosis caused by squamous cell carcinoma. All tumor evaluations including tumor markers, a thorough physical examination, imaging studies and evaluations of the nuclear medicine were negative except of intraperitoneal carcinoma, origin to be determined. The patient is dead 14 months' post-treatment by exploratory laparotomy. Although it was not clear that the laparoscopic approach or the disease itself worsened indeed the prognosis because the disease was already disseminated before the laparoscopy, we still emphasized the possible limitation of laparoscopic surgery if diagnosis at original surgery is impaired, of if excision is incomplete and the delay between the laparoscopic procedure and the carcinomatosis."

CD009786,0,6617038,0,Importance of proper staging in ovarian carcinoma.,"Therefore, on discovery of a clinical Stage I or II ovarian carcinoma through a previously made subumbilical incision, the incision should be extended above the umbilicus to enable one to inspect the diaphragm and remove the omentum from the transverse colon. Biopsy of any raised lesion of the diaphragm can easily be done with laparoscopic biopsy forceps and is associated with minimal morbidity. Routine biopsy of a normal appearing diaphragm is not advocated. Pelvic and paracolic washings for cytological evaluation for malignant cells are obtained by instilling 100-200 cm3 of saline into the pelvis and a similar amount into the right and left paracolic spaces, respectively, and aspirating the fluid for cytological evaluation. Most women with ovarian cancers are still primarily operated on by gynaecologists who are not trained in para-aortic and pelvic lymph node sampling. Ideally, however, women with clinical Stage I or II ovarian cancers should have biopsy of any palpable para-aortic or pelvic lymph node. Such careful surgical staging will: define those patients who are apt to truly have Stage I or II ovarian cancer; improve and refine adjuvant therapy for Stage I and II ovarian cancer; and allow for adjuvant therapy for patients found to have Stage III ovarian cancer, discovered at the time of surgical staging for presumed localized ovarian cancer. The significance of the latter is seen in Table 10 and in the fact that with the subsequent increase to 61 patients evaluated by the Ovarian Cancer Study Group, the incidence of occult metastases from Stage I and II ovarian cancer remain strikingly unchanged (Young et al, 1983, unpublished observations)."

Correlative cytologic and histologic study of celomic epithelial neoplasms.,"The ovary is commonly involved by a wide variety of neoplasms and nonneoplastic masses. Seventy-seven ovarian masses were aspirated using fine needles. They included 29 neoplasms classified as being of celomic epithelial origin. The study was performed in order to elucidate the cytologic features of material aspirated from these neoplasms and to correlate them with the histologic features. As expected, material aspirated from malignant neoplasms was much more cellular than material obtained from benign neoplasms. By studying the background material, nuclear and cytoplasmic features of the epithelial cells, as well as the presence of other structures such as psammoma and hyaline bodies, a fairly specific pattern can be recognized for each neoplasm. Using aspiration cytology, a conclusion can be made regarding the malignant or benign nature as well as the specific type and classification of the ovarian neoplasms. Aspiration cytology, especially with the increased use of laparoscopy, has a specific role to play in the diagnosis of celomic epithelial neoplasms of the ovary.

Twenty-three had epithelial ovarian cancer and 2 had advanced endometrial cancer. Twelve patients received IP carboplatin and IV doxorubicin at the conclusion of their primary cytoreduction. The remaining 13 received IP carboplatin alone and consisted of 4 reassessment laparotomies for ovarian cancer, 7 secondary cytoreductions, 1 minilaparotomy for the placement of an IP catheter, and 1 second-look laparoscopy. The median age of the 25 patients was 59 years. Eight patients underwent bowel resections with anastomoses; 2 had ureteral resections and ureteroneocystostomies, 1 required a splenectomy, and 1 underwent a partial hepatic resection. There were no mortalities. Three of the 13 patients who received the IP carboplatin alone had postoperative fevers with no infectious source, which did not delay discharge. No other morbidity was noted in this group. However, 7 patients who received IV doxorubicin along with the IP carboplatin developed severe leukopenia requiring antimicrobial and colony-stimulating factor support.

CD009786,0,7557204,0,[Total pelviscopic removal of ovarian tumors in a bag bag posterior colpotomy].,"Treatment of suspicious ovarian masses requires the oophorectomy in toto without opening the tumor or cyst wall. We describe a laparoscopic technique for the in-toto-removal of clinically suspicious ovarian tumours without puncture or morcellation of the tumour before it is entirely brought outside of the abdominal wall and without performing any abdominal incision longer than 25 mm: Oophorectomy is performed by means of bipolar coagulation and the CO2-laser. A nylon bag (Lapsac, Cook Inc.) is inserted into the abdomen and the ovary is enclosed in this bag by pulling the drawstring. The drawstring is held with a needleholder while the posterior vaginal fornix is opened. The needleholder drives the drawstring out of the pelvis through the vagina; this manoeuvre only takes a short amount of time, therefore preventing loss of CO2-gas and of visibility. By pulling the drawstring from outside the vagina the bag can be easily removed with its unmorcellated content. There is no danger of the intestines being damaged by a grasping forceps. Such a problem could occur in the event of extraction through a posterior culdotomy under impaired visibility due to loss of CO2-gas. Because the bag itself serves as a closing valve of the vaginal opening, there is a good visibility all the time."

The age of patients differed from 16-61 years (mean +/- s: 36 +/- 16). The histopathologic findings yielded 15 (11.8%) functional cysts, 30 (23.6%) persistent corpus luteum cysts, 9 (7.1%) endometriomas, 7 (5.5%) cystic teratomas, 9 (7.1%) undifferenciated cysts and 57 (44.9%) cystadenomas. There were no differences between histopathologic diagnosis groups according to age and cysts size by ultrasound. Functional cysts with complaints (n = 6) may explain that the observation time in 60% of all functional cysts was smaller than 6 weeks, whereas persistent corpus luteum cysts, endometriomas, cystic teratoma and cystadenomas had been observed for longer than 6 weeks in more than two thirds. Intraoperative evaluation of cysts content as ""chocolate""-like was suspicious of endometriomas, but was also present in cysts of other histopathological findings. By means of cytology, endometrioma (siderophages) was suspected in 44.4% and a cystadenoma in 42.1% of all histopathologically verified cases. In all, the cytologic findings were useful for correct histopathological diagnosis in only 33.9% of all 127 cases. It is concluded that differential diagnosis of simple ovarian cysts is not possible by clinical characteristics, neither by ultrasound nor by cytological evaluation. Ovarian cysts should be observed for at least two hormonal cycles. A hormonal treatment by combination preparations containing high doses of oestrogen is also recommended. In cases of persisting ovarian cysts laparoscopic removal is necessary."
CD009786,0,21751454,0,The approach to ovarian dermoids in adolescents and young women.,Mature cystic teratomas (MCTs) are the most common ovarian neoplastic lesions found in adolescents. MCTs are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on exam or imaging. The recurrence rate of MCTs following cystectomy is 3-4% and incidence of malignant transformation is estimated to be 0.17-2%. Given the accuracy with which MCTs can be diagnosed preoperatively studies suggest that these lesions can be treated surgically using laparoscopic techniques. The management of MCTs in the adolescent population poses unique challenges given the potential impact on sexual development and fertility.

The patient's menstrual periods had been regular since menarche at the age of 12 until she became amenorrheic at the age of 20. She visited our facility in November 1988 after receiving three cycles of estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy from a previous physician which caused withdrawal bleeding. Clomiphen citrate reportedly failed to induce apparent ovulation. On her first visit with us, she was 160 cm tall weighing 47 kg with apparent hoarseness but not with hirsutism. Pelvic examination revealed significant clitoromegaly but otherwise normal external and internal genitalia. Laparoscopic examination disclosed that her uterus appeared to be normal with bilateral ovaries relatively small (4 x 4 x 3 cm) without tumorous or polycystic appearance. Histological examination of her ovaries obtained at laparoscopy showed several primary follicles with mild infiltration of the stromal cells. No thickened tunica albuginea or cystic formation were observed. These findings did not support either polycystic ovary or hyperthecosis. Serum testosterone (T) levels were extremely high (7.1 ng/ml), while serum androstenedione levels were only slightly above normal range (3.1 ng/ml). Urine 17-KS excretion was slightly increased (6.1 mg/day), while 17-OHCS output was within normal range (4.0 mg/day). Basal serum LH and FSH levels were within normal range and LH pulse frequency was reduced to 1 in 4 hours. Administration of dexamethasone 1 mg/day for 2 days did not suppress circulating T and free T levels but lowered serum cortisol concentration and urine excretion of 17-OHCS. Blood glucose and insulin levels were within normal limits and their responses to oral glucose administration were normal. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography and computed tomography as well as adrenal scintigraphy did not reveal any tumorous lesions in bilateral adrenals and ovaries. Administration of GnRH agonist, Buserelin 900 micrograms/day, suppressed circulating T concentrations to 0.7 ng/ml in 8 days, while it had no significant effects on DHEA and DHEA-S levels. After 16 weeks of Buserelin administration, ovulation was successfully induced by hMG administration. Cyclic estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy by Kaufmann's schedule for 2 cycles also suppressed serum T levels to normal, female range. Thus, the present case represents non-neoplastic, non-PCO, ovarian hypertestosteronism which responded well both to GnRH agonist and estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy in terms of lowering circulating T levels."

Postmenopausal women found to have an adnexal cystic mass were retrospectively evaluated with transvaginal ultrasonography, and serum CA-125 levels. The selection criteria were adnexal cystic masses greater than 3 cm but less than 10 cm, the masses were in the benign range (4-8) of Sassone's scoring system for transvaginal ultrasonography, and the patients had serum CA-125 levels less than 65 IU/mL. Two hundred nineteen women fulfilled the criteria and underwent operative laparoscopy. Almost all the masses (99.5%) were accurately predicted to be benign except for one borderline ovarian tumor. Two hundreds thirteen (97.3%) women were successfully managed by operative laparoscopy and six (2.7%) required laparotomy. For the patients managed by laparoscopy, the mean operative time was 51.3 min; the mean hospital stay was 2.5 days. There was no significant morbidity and surgery-related mortality. The combination of the Sassone's scoring system for transvaginal ultrasonography and serum CA-125 level can accurately predict benign cystic masses, and operative laparoscopy is technically feasible and safe for the management of adnexal mass in postmenopausal women."

In ovarian surgery, we found a great number of benign ovarian cysts followed by a high rate of ovarian adhesions, which, counted together with the Fallopian tube and intestinal adhesions, amounted to 201 cases. In 9 women, the extirpation of a myoma was necessary and the largest one was 5.5 cm in diameter. In comparison with the total number of our surgical interventions, we had a high rate of appendectomies. Each surgeon is aware of the various locations of the appendix, of its close relation to the adnexae and the difficulty of clinical diagnosis of appendicitis in women, especially in pregnant women. We removed the appendix in two pregnant women (4th and 18th week of pregnancy). A pathological substrate was found in more than 80%.

CD009786,0,17617524,0,Management of borderline ovarian neoplasms.,"Over the last decades, the management of borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) has changed from radical surgery to more conservative therapy as a result of the need for fertility-sparing surgery and the increasing use of laparoscopy. The question is whether this is good clinical practice from an oncologic point of view. Here, recent literature regarding management of borderline ovarian neoplasms is reviewed, and oncologic concerns are discussed with emphasis on the mode of surgery and the possibility of fertility-sparing surgery and its consequences. Proper staging is defined as an exploration of the entire abdominal cavity with peritoneal washings, infracolic omentectomy, and multiple peritoneal biopsies as the cornerstone of a successful treatment, and this is only possible through a midline incision. For stage I disease, conservative surgery consisting of unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or cystectomy in case of bilateral ovarian involvement or when the disease develops in the only remaining ovary is a valuable alternative in a number of young patients who want to preserve their fertility. Patients with advanced-stage disease or who are finished childbearing are treated with radical surgery consisting of peritoneal washings, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy, complete peritoneal resection of macroscopic lesions, or multiple peritoneal biopsies; in case of mucinous BOTs, patients also are treated with an appendectomy."

Fifty-eight women underwent transvaginal sonography, which showed 69 adnexal masses, and laparoscopic ultrasonography, which showed 68 adnexal lesions. Conventional gray-scale ultrasonography (using transvaginal sonography and laparoscopic ultrasonography) was performed with morphologic characterization of internal architecture, followed by color Doppler imaging with spectral Doppler analysis where possible. A specific diagnosis was obtained with transvaginal sonography and laparoscopic ultrasonography based on a combination of imaging features. The specific diagnosis obtained with each imaging modality was compared with the final histologic diagnosis as the gold standard in 57 patients with 68 adnexal masses who underwent cystectomy or oophorectomy. The ability of laparoscopic sonography to detect the contralateral ovary and any residual ovarian tissue in the presence of a mass was also compared with transvaginal sonography. The accuracy of laparoscopic ultrasonography in the characterization of adnexal masses was 83.8% and that of transvaginal sonography was 73.5% (P < 0.05). Laparoscopic sonography showed greater morphologic detail than that obtained with transvaginal sonography, allowed more precise and specific characterization of adnexal masses, and detected additional adnexal lesions not evident on preoperative transvaginal sonography. Laparoscopic ultrasonography showed the contralateral ovary in 86.2% of patients, compared with 81.0% using transvaginal sonography (P = 0.51). In addition, laparoscopic ultrasonography was able to demonstrate the presence of residual ovarian tissue in the side affected pathologically in 76.5% of patients compared with 59.4% using transvaginal sonography (P < 0.005). Laparoscopic sonography allows more precise morphologic characterization of internal architecture and histologic diagnosis of adnexal lesions, but it is as yet unable to increase the diagnostic accuracy of borderline or malignant lesions, possibly due to the small sample size. Laparoscopic sonography is superior to transvaginal sonography in the evaluation of residual ovarian tissue in the side affected pathologically, which may help in surgical planning between cystectomy and oophorectomy, and also in the identification of the contralateral ovary, which may potentially increase the detection of bilateral pathologic conditions."

Eight (36.3%) patients had documented evidence of persistent ovarian cancer and were thus spared second-look laparotomy. Moreover, in 4 patients (18.1%), malignant cells in cytologic washings were the only laparoscopic evidence of persistent ovarian cancer. The absence of visible tumor and malignant cells in cytologic washings allows for the use of second-look laparotomy while the patient is under 1 anesthesia; the presence of tumor or malignant cells in cytologic washings spares the patient second-look laparotomy at that time."

Waiting such results, the standard treatment of advanced stage ovarian cancer in 2005 remains initial surgery, performed in order to obtain ideally a total resection of all macroscopic diseases, and followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. However, in patients with massive spread, interval debulking surgery is becoming an interesting option, and will perhaps become a standard management.

Errors were mainly made in the diagnosis of borderline tumours with a predictive value of 87.5% (7 of 8). The negative predictive value was 98.4% (127 of 129). Frozen section however, was less accurate in the diagnosis of specific histological type with an accuracy rate of 91.9% (159 of 173). Macroscopic features were found to be useful in the intraoperative prediction of malignant potential. Completely cystic tumours were benign in 96.4% (108 of 167) of cases. Solid/cystic tumors were malignant in 69% (27 of 38) of cases. Completely solid tumours were malignant in 56% (9 of 16) of cases. Frozen section in completely cystic tumours only marginally improved the clinical macroscopic diagnosis of malignancy. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound scan in the diagnosis of malignant/borderline tumours were 82% and 86% respectively. The false negative rate of 7% makes laparoscopic excision of unsuspected malignant ovarian cyst a significant possibility. The predictive value of ultrasound scan in the diagnosis of malignant ovarian tumour was 62% (26 of 42). In the preoperative assessment of malignant potential of ovarian tumours, this study shows that ultrasound scan has a high false positive and a significant false negative rate. Careful intraoperative assessment of gross features and the use of frozen section especially in those with solid/cystic and solid tumours will help achieve a high accuracy rate in the assessment of ovarian tumours."

The following methods were employed for instrumental diagnosis: USI, computerized tomography and laparoscopy. Hormonal investigation included the determination of basal levels of serum testosterone (T), excretion with urine of 17-ketosteroids and their time course against a background of suppression tests with dexamethasone and stimulation tests with CG. The results of hormonal investigations were compared with those of similar investigations of 14 patients with stromal ovarian thecomatosis and 8 patients with androgen producing adrenal tumors. Ovarian tumors were detected in 40% by instrumental and clinical methods. Hormonal studies revealed a high level of T in patients with virile ovarian and adrenal tumors exceeding 3-3.8-fold a similar indicator in patients with stromal thecomatosis. All patients with a ""tumor"" level of T underwent laparotomy after excluding an adrenal lesion. Ovarian tumors of 1.0-2.5 cm in diameter were detected."

Recent acquisitions].,"The authors report on their experience with two cases of Krukenberg's tumour treated at Chioggia Hospital in patients admitted for pelvic tumours. The clinical manifestation of Krukenberg's tumour is mainly related to the presence of the pelvic mass even in advanced forms of gastrointestinal cancers. The authors stress the importance of an adequate follow-up of premenopausal patients with a previous gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma because the incidence of ovarian metastases is quite frequent and influences the prognosis. The Authors do not consider a bilateral preventive ovariectomy associated with gastrectomy as advisable in premenopausal patients, because the studies to date are inadequate for the purposes of drawing conclusions regarding the benefit of these procedures. They consider a more valid policy to be a thorough follow-up in women with a previous gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma because the priority must be accorded to diagnosing secondary lesions so as to be able to perform an ovariectomy which may improve the prognosis. With this in mind it is important to assess Ca 19.9 and perform radiological procedures, such as CT and MRI. The prognosis may be distinctly unfavourable as in one of the cases reported by the Authors involving a very rare form of secondary lesion of the bone marrow and consequent medullary aplasia, with the onset of severe haemorrhages in several areas leading to the patient's death. They consider that surgical treatment should be preceded by a diagnostic laparoscopy. When there are other concomitant negative prognostic factors such as neoplastic ascites and perineal carcinosis, ovariectomy will prove ineffective from the prognostic point of view."

A few ovarian lesions have been reported that are associated with massive ovarian edema. This article describes the first case of an ovarian serous cystadenoma associated with a massive ovarian edema. The patient was a 17-year-old female who was referred to the emergency room because of lower abdominal pain. Subsequent ultrasound and computed tomography scanning studies revealed an abdominopelvic cystic mass suggestive of an ovarian neoplasm. She underwent an exploratory laparoscopy, and a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The specimen weighed 1610 g and consisted of a cystic mass measuring 17 x 15 x 8 cm attached to a solid mass measuring 13 x 11 x 4 cm. Microscopy revealed a cystic and a solid lesion. The cystic structure was composed of a flat or cuboidal single-layer lining showing ciliated epithelium and focal areas of papillary structures compatible with a diagnosis of ovarian serous cystadenoma. The solid mass had an intact capsule and diffuse interstitial edema, preserving the overall structure of the ovary and sparing the outer cortex. These findings are compatible with the diagnosis of ovarian massive edema. This report of an association of serous cystadenoma with massive ovarian edema broadens the histologic spectrum in which a massive ovarian edema may be encountered."

CD009786,0,9463084,0,[The place of second-look laparoscopy in monitoring treatment of advanced malignant ovarian neoplasms].,"The role of second-look laparotomy in management of advanced ovarian cancer is still controversial. One of the arguments against this method is the risk of this wide operation. Replacement of second-look laparotomy by laparoscopy maybe the way to minimize that risk. The aim of this report is the comparison of second-look laparotomy and laparoscopy. The prospectively gathered material consists of 56 women with ovarian cancer, 17 of them were qualified for second-look procedures. Laparoscopy was the first step in this procedure. In 5 patient the residual malignancy in abdominal cavity was found. In 11 there were no evidence of the disease, and in 1 case laparoscopic inspection was impossible. When the laparoscopy was negative or impossible the second-look laparotomy was performed. Only in one case after negative laparoscopy the evidence of malignancy during laparotomy was found. In our opinion: 1) Positive second-look laparoscopy is equivalent to laparotomy and permits to avoid it. 2) The negative second-look laparoscopy with its contemporary technique still requires the subsequent laparotomy."

CD009786,0,1829343,0,Pelviscopic surgery: a key for conserving fertility.,"As a result of experience with more than 16,000 pelviscopic operative procedures performed at the Kiel University Women's Clinic from 1971 to 1988 which in this time had been adapted and used around the world, it may be said that the pelviscopic operative techniques, based completely on the laparotomy techniques which employ the microscissors, needles and suture material, is superior for many of the classical gynecological indications to operation. Minimally invasive surgery reduces hospitalization for even the most difficult cases to approximately 3 days. Convalescence is also reduced to approximately 1 week. Postoperative complaints are few, particularly when the primary exudate is removed through an abdominal drain. Late complications are practically unknown. It must be said that even the most minimal of operative procedures can produce late postoperative complaints or can be ascribed as the source of late postoperative complaints. Experiences gathered from around the world with endoscopically guided intraabdominal surgery have shown that for some gynecological procedures laparotomy is now indicated only in the rare case. The leading example of this switch can be seen in the operative treatment of the ectopic pregnancy. Following closely are operations to correct sterility such as salpingolysis, ovariolysis, fimbrioplasty, and salpingostomy. Finally pelviscopic treatment is increasing for all benign ovarian tumors, and the enucleation of myomas of up to 400 grams in weight. Endoscopically guided intraabdominal surgery also has a place in the field of general abdominal surgery--that of treatment of chronic abdominal adhesions. These procedures in the future should basically commence with endoscopic adhesiolysis, the patient having had the proper preoperative bowel preparation. Because of this minimally invasive technique the surgeon will only rarely be forced to perform laparotomy. In the case of abdominal adhesions a prerequisite for pelviscopic treatment is the visually controlled perforation of the peritoneum. Endoscopic surgery, in contrast to open laparoscopy, has a large periumbilical radius of action and produces no postoperative scars. In Kiel operative pelviscopy has replaced 80% of the classic gynecological laparotomies. The recurrence rate of adhesions is 84% with laparotomy compared with a recurrence rate of less than 40% with postendoscopic adhesiolysis. Forty to sixty percent of the patients who underwent pelviscopic adhesiolysis are complaint-free; this is a result not attained with classical abdominal surgery. Adhesiolysis per laparotomy is now limited to the emergency situation, as in the cases of ileus, for example. Endoscopically guided intraabdominal surgery has now improved the quality of life for surgical patients."

CD009786,0,10952124,0,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus primary debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer.,"Primary surgical cytoreduction followed by chemotherapy usually is the preferred management of advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer. The presence of residual disease after surgery is one of the most important adverse prognostic factors for survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been proposed as an alternative approach to conventional surgery as initial management of bulky ovarian cancer, with the goal of improving surgical quality. Since 1989, we have been treating advanced epithelial ovarian cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead of primary cytoreductive surgery in approximately half of the patients with stage III-IV disease. Selection of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was based on disease-related characteristics (eg, metastatic tumor load, stage of disease, performance status). Since 1993, open laparoscopy also has been used to aid in evaluating operability. A retrospective analysis of 338 patients was conducted to compare outcomes during 1989 to 1998, when neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used, with those observed during 1980 to 1988, when all patients underwent primary cytoreductive surgery. Crude 3-year survival rates were higher and postoperative mortality rates were lower during the second time period compared with the first. Overall, the results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in survival rates in selected patients with advanced ovarian cancer that are comparable with those associated with primary cytoreductive surgery. Patients with stage IV disease, total metastatic tumor load greater than 1,000 g, uncountable plaque-shaped peritoneal metastases, and/or a poor performance status are probably the best candidates for this alternative approach. A prospective randomized study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and primary cytoreductive surgery is ongoing."

All patients undergo preoperative lab work, imaging studies and bowel preparation prior to surgery. The Davinci surgical system is used to perform urinary cystectomy, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvic adenectomy (including obturator, hypogastic, external iliac, and common iliac lymph nodes). In addition, debulking to less than 1 cm is performed. The anterior pelvic exenteration procedure involves wide perivesical dissection. Then the robot is locked, and ileal conduit is performed via a 6 cm lower midline incision. Operative time can be maintained in 4.6 hours with a mean blood loss of 215 ml and hospital stay of five days. Farghaly's technique of robotic-assisted laparoscopic anterior pelvic exenteration in patients with advanced ovarian cancer is safe, feasible, and cost-effective with acceptable operative, pathological and short- and long-term clinical outcomes. It retains the advantage of minimally invasive surgery."

There is controversy regarding the frequency of the Y-chromosome-derived material and the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in these patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate a large number of patients with UTS, followed before and during the pubertal age for the prevalence of Y-chromosome derived material, the occurrence of gonadoblastoma, and the incidence of possible neoplastic degeneration. An unselected series of 171 patients with UTS (1-34 years old), diagnosed cytogenetically, was studied for Y-chromosome markers (SRY and Y-centromeric DYZ3 repeats). The follow-up was of 2-22 years; 101 of these patients were followed during pubertal age. Y-chromosome material was found in 14 patients (8%): 12 of these were gonadectomized (2.8-25.9 years). A gonadoblastoma was detected in four patients under 16 years of age: in two, Y-material was detected only at molecular analysis (at conventional cytogenetic analysis, one was included in the 45,X group and one in the X + mar group) and one had also an immature teratoma and an endodermal sinus carcinoma. The prevalence of gonadoblastoma in our series of gonadectomized UTS patients with Y-positive material was of 33.3% (4/12). Our data suggest that the age of appearance and the possibility of malignant degeneration of gonadoblastoma can occur early in life. These patients, in particular those with 45,X or a marker chromosome may benefit from molecular screening to detect the presence of Y-chromosome material; PCR is a rapid and inexpensive technique. At the moment, laparoscopy and preventive gonadectomy performed as soon as possible remain the procedures of choice for patients with UTS, when Y-chromosome has been identified, as we are still unable to predict a future malignant evolution of gonadoblastoma."
CD009786,0,6212328,0,[Diagnosis in progressive hirsutism. Catheter technique and results (author's transl)].,"Catheterization of adrenal and ovarian veins in combination with hormone concentration analyses was performed in seventy hirsute women. There was suspicion of tumor in 30 cases because of excess androgen production (plasma testosterone more than 1,5 ng/ml and/or plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate more than 7000 ng/ml in peripheral blood samplings). Catheterization and blood sampling was done with a femoro-visceral catheter by the transfemoral approach. Contributary blood flows from many different venous systems were found to be more often to the right ovarian and to the left adrenal veins in comparisons to the other side. Catheterization of the wrong vessels occurred without being recognized immediately (circumaortic renal collar, inferior phrenic vein, ascending lumbar vein). These pitfalls might falsify blood samplings. There were no significant complications. Seven ovarian tumors were localized. Their size ranged from 0,5 to 2,5 cm in diameter. They were not recognized during laparoscopy. There were 10 hyperthecoses, four adrenogenital syndromes, one abortive testis, one adrenal adenoma, one Cushing's syndrome and one Cushing's disease due to an adenoma of the pituitary gland. In five patients a diagnosis could not be made. Tumor was excluded in forty patients. Their virilization was of adrenal origin in 32%, of ovarian origin in 29%, and of both adrenal and ovarian origin in 22%. In 17% a source of the excess androgen production was not found. This differential diagnosis is not important for the patient therapy."

The second look, at first largely used in patients in which had been performed adjuvant chemotherapy with drugs containing platinum and with no evidence of residual disease, has been later strongly criticized and the effective usefulness of this invasive procedure discussed. At the moment, we think that the indications for its execution are still large because with the second look it is also possible to put into the abdomen a catheter which can be used for locoregional chemotherapy and there is now the opportunity to perform this procedure also in video-laparoscopy."

CD009786,0,161983,0,[The indications for laparoscopy in malignant tumours of the ovary (author's transl)].,"The diagnosis of a malignant ovarian tumour can be made laparoscopically. It is particularly indicated in cases of ascites occurring by itself due to a neoplasm or of undiagnosed origin, and in cases of infiltration of the pelvic nodes or when a small abdominal mass, whether it is isolated or associated with ascites, is found. This particularly of value when a cytological examination of the ascitic fluid does not indicate the diagnosis. Laparoscopy is a means by which the degree of spread of abdomino-pelvic lesions can be discerned in cases where the malignant nature of the ovary is known, but where the prognoses for its removal, either immediately or after several cures with chemotherapy, are doubtful and where the degree of spread has not been correctly and precisely determined at the first surgical intervention. Therefore laparoscopy can complete the information obtained from pelvic examinations and avoid the need for carrying out an exploratory laparotomy, but is gives less information than this latter does about the degree of spread in the pelvis and in the abdomen. So, laparoscopy is a means by which repeated control of the results of therapy which is more thorough than clinical examination can be assured, particularly because it acts as a check on peritoneal cytology. Although its interpretation can be very difficult and its reliability is a relative one, the latter is a good criterion of follow-up."
CD009786,0,7882629,0,Operative laparoscopy in gynaecological oncology.,"Initial reports on the role of laparoscopy in gynaecological malignancies have centred around staging procedures. Laparoscopic lymphadenectomy, both pelvic and para-aortic, appears to be feasible and adequate. It appears that laparoscopy may play an important role in reviving the radical vaginal hysterectomy for patients with early cervical cancer. Similarly, an abdominal incision may be avoided in patients with early endometrial carcinoma by employing laparoscopic staging with vaginal hysterectomy. The role laparoscopy will play in ovarian cancer is still to be defined, and laparoscopic advocates must be cautious in this subset of patients. However, for those gynaecological oncologists employing second-look procedures, it appears that beginning with laparoscopy may make laparotomy unnecessary in the majority of patients. Survival data for patients with gynaecological malignancies managed using laparoscopy in lieu of laparotomy are still lacking. It is imperative that survival is not compromised by employing a new surgical technique. Cost data comparing laparoscopy to laparotomy in our subspeciality is unavailable. This increasingly important aspect of medical care may influence the future of laparoscopy. These and other important issues need to be addressed by future trials before the role of laparoscopy in gynaecological oncology can be determined."

From experimental data, the laparoscopic treatment of gynecologic cancer has potential advantages and disadvantages. The risk of dissemination appears high when a large number of malignant cells are present so that adnexal tumors with external vegetations, and bulky lymph nodes may be considered as contra-indications to CO2 laparoscopy. Laparoscopic surgery has become the gold standard in the treatment of benign adnexal tumeurs, whereas laparotomy remains the standard for the treatment of malignant tumors. The surgical diagnosis is the key to adequate management of adnexal tumeurs. In our experience, after a careful preoperative evaluation, the laparoscopic diagnosis of malignancy is reliable. Moreover in national surveys, many malignant tumeurs were considered as benign despite suspicious laparoscopic findings. Using strict guidelines, laparoscopic diagnosis can be proposed for both non suspicious and complex tumeurs, thus avoiding many unnecessary laparotomies for benign tumeurs suspicious at ultrasound. The more controversial limits of laparoscopic treatment are discussed. If a laparotomy was performed for all tumeurs suspicious at surgery, 80% of the cases would be treated by laparoscopy.

During the next eleven months new adhesive obstructions of the bowel developed and a third operation had to be performed incl. resection of the dolichosigmoideum on account of chronic problems during defaecation. A special tube as a intraluminal splint was inserted as prophylaxis of mechanical ileus in the postoperative period. But during next thirteen months subileous conditions and mechanical ileus developed again (up to now). The picture of intraperitoneal conditions was disastrous: almost total fibrotic changes allowed only partial adhesectomy. The passage through bowel is limited and is restricted to dietetic and medicamentous preparations. This case-report demonstrates postoperative adhesions a very old and very serious problem at the beginning of the third millennium."
CD009786,0,20620297,0,"Neonatal ovarian torsion complicated by intestinal obstruction and perforation, and review of the literature.","We present a case of neonatal ovarian torsion complicated by bowel obstruction and perforation and review the literature regarding the incidence of bowel obstruction in neonatal ovarian cysts, the presentation, and treatment. A term neonate was prenatally diagnosed with a cystic abdominal mass palpable on physical examination. A postnatal abdominal x-ray showed paucity of gas in the left hemiabdomen with rightward displacement of bowel loops. Exploratory laparotomy on day 2 of life revealed a large cystic mass in the left lower quadrant consistent with a torsed left ovary, an omental band causing strangulation of the bowel mesentery, and a perforation of the distal ileum. Our literature search revealed 19 reported cases of neonatal ovarian cysts resulting in bowel obstruction. Infants may present with a palpable abdominal mass, respiratory distress, as well as signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Two mechanisms exist for bowel obstruction: adhesions caused by a torsed necrotic ovary and mass effect of a large ovarian cyst, often measuring 9 to 10 cm in diameter. Options to treat ovarian cysts include antenatal or postnatal aspiration, laparoscopy, and laparotomy. Cysts less than 4 to 5 cm can be observed, whereas operative intervention is indicated in symptomatic cases and in persistent or enlarging ovarian cysts."
CD009786,0,9499545,0,[Current trends in the surgical management of ovarian cancer].,"Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies in western countries, it is diagnosed at an advanced stage in approximately 75% of patients. The current standard treatment for ovarian cancer consists of maximum cytoreductive surgery to reduce tumor residuum to a minimum, followed by platin-based chemotherapy. If an unsuspected ovarian cancer is detected at diagnostic laparoscopy, staging and debulking by laparotomy should be undertaken without delay. For apparently early stages (I or II), appropriate surgical staging is extremely important and will result in the upstaging of about one-third of patients (usually to Stage III). Several retrospective clinical trials show that successful cytoreduction and systemic lymphonodectomy result in an improved survival, but prospective randomized studies have not been performed to evaluate this benefit. Patients who cannot initially be cytoreduced to an optimal stage should be considered candidates for interval cytoreduction after chemotherapy. Repeated surgical debulking in relapsed patients will probably only benefit a small subset of selected patients (e.g. disease-free interval > 2 years). Surgery may also be important for palliation, such as for the treatment of bowel obstruction to improve the patients quality of life. The question still remains whether the observed improved survival rates for patients with ovarian cancer are an effect of primary cytoreductive surgery or tumor biology."
CD009786,0,15841027,0,The role of laparoscopy in ovarian tumors of low malignant potential and early-stage ovarian cancer.,"Although it is feasible today to perform laparoscopic surgical staging and treatment of ovarian low malignant potential tumors and early-stage ovarian cancer safely, it is still generally agreed that a patient with ovarian cancer should have a laparotomy. Concerns related to laparoscopy in managing gynecologic malignancy include the accuracy of intraoperative diagnosis, inadequate resection, significance of tumor spillage, improper or delay in surgical staging, delay in therapy, and the possibility of port-site metastasis. On the other hand, laparoscopy has the advantages of being a minimally invasive surgery, with shorter hospitalization, decreased postoperative pain, and quicker return to normal daily activities. We review the current literature discussing the consequences of laparoscopic surgery in ovarian tumors of low malignant potential and early-stage ovarian cancer."
CD009786,0,11594544,0,Laparoscopic management of adnexal masses the opportunities and the risks.,"Suspected ovarian neoplasm is a common clinical problem affecting women of all ages. Although the majority of adnexal masses are benign, the primary goal of diagnostic evaluation is the exclusion of malignancy. It has been estimated that approximately 5-10% of women in the United States will undergo a surgical procedure for a suspected ovarian neoplasm during their lifetime. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is still considerable disagreement regarding the optimal surgical management of these lesions. Traditional management has relied on laparotomy to avoid undertreatment of a potentially malignant process. Advances in detection, diagnosis, and minimally invasive surgical techniques make it necessary now to review this practice in an effort to avoid unnecessary morbidity among patients. Here, we review the literature on the laparosopic approach to the treatment of the adnexal mass without sacrificing the principles of oncologic surgery. We highlight potentials of minimally invasive surgery and address the risks associated with the laparoscopic approach."
CD009786,0,16525789,0,Endometriosis associated with Stage IA clear cell ovarian carcinoma in a woman with IVF-ET treatments in the Yale Series.,"A 42-year-old woman with Stage IA, grade 3 clear cell ovarian carcinoma arising within an endometrioma after multiple ovarian stimulation attempts was a unique case from a total of 900 patients who underwent laparoscopy for infertility and pelvic pain between 1996 and 2002 at Yale University. Her previous treatments included two laparoscopic cystectomies for left ovarian endometriomas and four cycles of IVF-ET that resulted in one miscarriage and two successful pregnancies. Although it has been suggested that controlled ovarian hyperstimulation may predispose to the development of ovarian cancer, more recent studies postulate a protective effect if fertility treatments ultimately result in successful pregnancy. Our unusual case serves as a reminder that clear cell adenocarcinoma may coexist with endometriosis, and that parity does not necessarily protect infertility patients against the development of ovarian cancer."

Twenty-eight children (mean age 13 years; range 8 to 16) underwent 30 laparoscopy procedures. Therapeutic laparoscopy was performed in 3 cases: transposition of an ovary before radiotherapy, bilateral gonadal excision for Turner's syndrome and ovarian fixation after contralateral torsion of normal adnexa (TNA). Diagnostic and potentially therapeutic laparoscopy was performed in 25 cases: 12 suspected torsion of adnexa (6 confirmed), 4 possible ovarian or appendicular pathology (1 appendicitis), 4 to confirm the histological nature of an ovarian tumor (2 functional cysts, 1 old TNA, 1 dermoid cyst), 3 suspected salpingitis (2 confirmed), and 2 chronic pelvic pain (1 endometriosis). No pathology was found in 2 cases, and in 1 case pelvic adhesions prevented confirmation of the diagnosis. Thirteen laparoscopically-guided surgical acts were performed: 2 detorsions of adnexa, 2 excisions of necrosed adnexa and 9 punctures with or without biopsy for functional cysts. Intralaparoscopic detorsion of TNA was complicated in one case by fibrinolysis requiring secondary laparotomy. Mean hospitalisation was 3 days (range 1 to 16). the preferential therapeutic indications for laparoscopy in the child are transposition of an ovary and ablation of the gonads in case of sexual ambiguity. It is used diagnostically in cases of sudden pelvic pain. In addition to this diagnostic role, it now allows most treatments to be carried out (detorsion with or without fixation, transparietal cystectomy), including those for associated lesions (appendicectomy). Its morbidity is quite low, which warrants increasing the number of indications in pediatric pathology."
CD009786,0,1839658,0,What can we expect from the surgical management of endometriosis?,"In endometriosis, radical surgery to remove both ovaries appears to be the only truly lasting cure. However, to retain or improve fertility potential, conservative surgery to remove all visible endometriotic deposits is often employed. Traditional conservative surgery using laparotomy is time-consuming and involves large, painful, slow-healing incisions, but, it is argued, modern developments in minimally invasive endoscopic surgery using advanced laparoscopy with lasers offer significantly reduced operation time, discomfort and convalescence. These surgical advances are reviewed. Although their effectiveness remains to be confirmed in controlled clinical trials, they appear to produce good results and are safe in experienced hands."

CD009786,0,12807227,0,Reflections on the FIGO surgical staging of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer.,"The main aims and requirements of any staging system are: to determine the anatomical extent of disease, to allow uniform reporting of treatment results, comparison of their efficacy and pooling of data from various institutions. It should be based on the mode of spread of the neoplasm, take into consideration prognostic risk factors and be of prognostic value. A critical review of the FIGO staging system for ovarian carcinoma indicates that these aims and requirements are not entirely fulfilled. Following are some examples. It does not include exact recommendations for comprehensive surgical staging in apparently early ovarian cancer and staging is therefore not performed uniformly. The presence of parenchymal liver and lung metastasis may be facilitated by modern imaging devices. However, according to FIGO rules only simple X-ray procedures are allowed preoperatively. The correlation between increasing stage and survival is inconsistent and sometimes contrary to that expected. Many known prognostic factors are not included in the present staging system. Although the aims of data pooling and of uniform reporting of treatment results have been achieved, the validity of some comparisons are questionable in view of the variations in staging. The intent of this review was not to belittle the major contribution of staging to research, understanding and management of ovarian carcinoma, but to highlight its deficiencies. New data have accumulated since the FIGO staging system of ovarian carcinoma has been adopted and should prompt consideration of modifications such as incorporation of modern diagnostic procedures and of some established prognostic markers and reshuffling of certain substages."
CD009786,0,9118426,0,Intralaparoscopic ultrasound and Doppler sonography in urology.,"Common practice with intraoperative sonography during open surgery has demonstrated that ultrasounds supply important information that can help the urologist in decision making; in addition, the growing popularity of laparoscopy has underscored the importance of laparoscopic ultrasonography. Laparoscopic ultrasound combines the advantage of diagnostic laparoscopy and intraoperative contact ultrasonography. The authors report their experience with intralaparoscopic ultrasonography using a 7.5-MHz transesophageal probe in several paradigmatic urologic applications, in which intraoperative ultrasonography was employed to provide anatomical information, to supply efficiency in confirming and excluding anticipated or unexpected pathology, and to solve diagnostic problems using high-resolution, real-time, B-mode ultrasound. Intralaparoscopic ultrasound proves to be a simple, efficient procedure that provides useful information in order to help the urologist in intraoperative decision making."

Fourteen patients underwent laparoscopic removal of such tumours. There were no operative complications. Post-operative hospitalization was short (average: 2 days). All patients undergoing a second-look laparoscopy had mild adhesions around the operated ovary. Two spontaneous and one in-vitro fertilization pregnancy occurred. If a teratoma is diagnosed during laparoscopy or oocyte retrieval, it should be promptly removed as malignant transformation is not excluded. In this case, the embryos should be frozen for later transfer."
CD009786,0,21793996,0,Primary transitional cell carcinoma of the fallopian tube.,"The fallopian tube is the least common site for origin of malignancy in the female genital tract. Most primary fallopian tube malignancies are adenocarcinomas. Primary transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the fallopian tube is an extremely rare tumor with a small number of cases reported in the literature. We present a 67-year-old woman who was found incidentally to have a left adnexal mass on a screening pelvic ultrasound. Subsequently the patient underwent laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy and the specimen was submitted for intraoperative frozen section, which revealed a high-grade carcinoma; therefore, she underwent a laparotomy and total abdominal hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy. Histopathology revealed high-grade transitional cell carcinoma in the left fallopian tube. Post-surgery she was treated with four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel with no complications. Our patient had a family history of malignancy, so genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was undertaken and did not reveal any mutation or unclassified variants. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was normal."
CD009786,0,9876656,0,Endoscopic management of adnexal masses.,"The laparoscopic management of suspicious adnexal masses and early ovarian malignancies is discussed with the aim of maintaining accepted oncologic treatment principles. Comparative survival data of patients with gynecological malignancies managed by laparoscopy or laparotomy are still very scarce and the survival of cancer patients must not be compromised by new techniques. It is time to closely analyze laparoscopy and determine if it has a positive impact on the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian malignancies. In this paper we will address the following points: 1) Which ovarian cysts can be surgically treated by laparoscopy (pelviscopy)? 2) Is staging laparoscopy an accepted technique? 3) Is laparoscopy, as a second-look procedure, of benefit? 4) Is laparoscopic staging, together with histologic tissue sampling, adequate surgical technique in inoperable ovarian cancer with ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis? 5) Does endoscopic biopsy of ovarian cancer stage Ia change the destiny of a patient into ovarian cancer Ic?"

CD009786,0,17484640,0,Indications for hand-assisted laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors.,"Radiofrequency ablation has established itself as the preferred treatment for irresectable liver tumors. It can be performed either percutaneously, laparoscopically, or by open surgery. The choice of approach depends on the patient and tumor-related variables. The laparoscopic approach appears to be the safest and most effective method for small tumors on the liver surface. It also provides additional information on the intrahepatic tumor burden with the use of intraoperative ultrasound and staging laparoscopy. Furthermore, the pneumoperitoneum reduces the flow of the portal vein and increases the efficacy of the ablation. Depending on the location of the tumor, mobilization of the liver or lysis of adhesions from previous surgery can require open surgery. Our aim was to study the combined use of laparoscopy and laparotomy by using hand-assisted laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation."

CD009786,0,11918456,0,Elevated serum cancer antigen 125 levels in advanced abdominal tuberculosis.,"A 48-yr-old female presented with a 1-yr history of pain in the hypochondrium and epigastrium. All routine investigations and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen were done. CT findings revealed a well-defined cystic mass in the right ovary, and ascitis with features suggestive of secondaries over the omentum and peritoneal surface. The serum CA125 was 1255 U/mL (normal range 0-35 U/mL), which was indicative of ovarian malignancy. An exploratory laparotomy was performed. Histopathological examination of organs revealed the presence of granuloma. The patient was advised to undergo antitubercular treatment (ATT) and follow-up every month. After 1 mo of ATT, the CA125 level came down to 42 U/mL, which was near normal. As tuberculosis requires only a conservative management, we suggest that in cases of abdominopelvic mass with or without ascitis, high serum CA125 should always raise a suspicion of tuberculosis and a laparoscopy combined with peritoneal biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This will prevent unnecessary laparotomies. Moreover, serum CA125 can be used to monitor the response of disease to antitubercular treatment."

These combinations were high-dose methotrexate-leucovorin plus cyclophosphamide (MECY) or cyclophosphamide, hexamethylmelamine, doxorubicin, and DDP (CHAD). Patients with no clinically measurable disease after 6 months of therapy were evaluated by laparoscopy. In the absence of disease progression at the time of the laparoscopy the study design called for a repeat cycle of four weekly DDP courses and another five monthly courses of the assigned multidrug combination. All patients with no evidence of disease after 1 year of treatment had a second-look laparoscopy which, if negative, was followed by a second-look laparotomy. This report includes all of the consecutively entered patients observed for a minimum of 1 year or to death. DDP-MECY and DDP-CHAD were similarly active for overall response rates and complete response rates according to laparoscopic criteria. However, DDP-MECY had a statistically significantly lower relapse rate (P less than 0.02) and a statistically significantly higher negative second-look laparotomy rate than did DDP-CHAD. Using all entered patients, with no exclusions from analysis, eight of 17 patients (47%) treated with DDP-MECY had negative second-looks after 1 year of treatment. This compares with one of 16 (6%) negative second-looks in patients treated with DDP-CHAD (P less than 0.02). The high negative second-look rate with DDP-MECY is exciting. Positive cytologic washings at the 6-month laparoscopic evaluation were highly predictive that residual disease would be found at the 1-year second-look surgery. Only one patient with positive peritoneal cytology after 6 months of treatment was found to have a negative second-look after 1 year of therapy."

In select patients, recurrent disease also may be managed with surgical cytoreduction. At the other end of the spectrum, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy has been shown conclusively to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women at high risk. Although BRCA1-associated and BRCA2-associated gynecologic cancer syndromes do not seem to include uterine malignancies, the role of hysterectomy to remove the fallopian tube completely is controversial. Finally, new data support the concept of conservative, fertility-sparing surgery in a select group of women with early-stage disease.

If used appropriately, many patients will benefit from minimally-invasive surgery. We compared clinical factors of patients having laparoscopy to those having laparotomy in a case-control study of 30 patients with adnexal masses. Oophorectomy or ovarian cystectomy was performed by laparoscopy for 20 women and by laparotomy for 10 women. Comparing the 2 groups, the most significant difference was the decrease in length of hospital stay in the laparoscopy group. There were no significant differences in operative time or intraoperative complications. Estimated blood loss was lower in the laparoscopy group, and no intraoperative complications occurred. No patient required conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy. All patients had benign disease despite the inclusion of patients with risk factors for ovarian carcinoma.

The purpose of our study was to examine the impact of IDS on clinical outcomes of patients considered unsuitable for PDS and compare them with outcomes of women that had conventional PDS followed by chemotherapy."
CD009786,0,9773541,0,[Peritoneal carcinomatosis].,"Searching for the primitive tumor of a peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is no easy task even considering the multiple modern diagnostic procedures at our disposal. Without the primary site of a neoplasm it is often difficult to establish the prognosis and a treatment regimen. In PC the most frequent primitive tumors are ovarian neoplasms in women and gastrointestinal neoplasms in men. We present a case report of a 70-year-old Caucasian woman who was referred to our department for diagnosis and management of a PC. A fine-catheter aspiration cytology of the peritoneal implants was performed and provided histologic evidence of an ovarian papillary type carcinoma. This case is suggestive of what has been called in recent literature extraovarian peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma. Absent or insignificant histology of the ovaries of primary in-situ ovarian carcinoma is one diagnostic criterion. This patient had no evidence of ovarian disease considering ultrasound imaging and computer tomography. Unfortunately, since both laparotomy and laparoscopy were contraindicated, histology of the ovaries is lacking."
CD009786,0,20873867,0,Novel surgical approaches for sampling the ovarian surface epithelium and proximal fluid proteome.,"The pathogenesis of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers has been difficult to elucidate despite intense effort. Recently, though, the care of women felt to be at high risk due to a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer or a known germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has provided potential insight into the development of these malignancies. Risk-reducing surgical removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries, called risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy (RRBSO), is commonly performed as a laparoscopic procedure to minimize recovery time. We describe here an optimized surgical sampling workflow for analyzing the proteomes of peritoneal, fallopian tube, and ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) specimens collected at the time of laparoscopic RRBSO, a technique which has not been described previously. This methodology presents a unique opportunity for closer examination of the proteomic alterations in the tissues at risk for malignant transformation in women with an inherited susceptibility to ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer development."

In a large phase III trial ovarian cancer patients in complete clinical remission with FIGO stage Ic-IV were randomized between standard treatment plus a single IP (90)Y-labeled muHMFG1 versus standard treatment alone after negative second-look laparoscopy. Case report forms of all patients with disease recurrence were reviewed to determine site and date of recurrent disease. In total 447 patients were included in the study with a median follow-up of 3.5 years. Relapse was seen in 104/224 in the active and 98/223 in the control arm. Significantly fewer IP (p < 0.05) and more extraperitoneal (p < 0.05) relapses occurred in the active treatment arm. Time to IP recurrence was significantly longer (p = 0.0019) and time to extraperitoneal recurrence was significantly shorter for the active treatment arm (p < 0.001). The impact of IP radioimmunotherapy on IP relapse-free survival could only be seen in the subgroup of patients with residual disease after primary surgery (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.53; p = 0.002). Although, there is no survival benefit for IP radioimmunotherapy as consolidation treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer, we found an improved control of IP disease, that was offset by increased extraperitoneal recurrences."

CD009786,0,7855346,0,From the archives of the AFIP. Ovarian epithelial neoplasms: radiologic-pathologic correlation.,"Ovarian carcinoma is the most common cause of death from a gynecologic malignant neoplasm. The typically advanced stage at presentation and aggressive nature of these neoplasms result in an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 40%. Most malignant ovarian neoplasms are of the surface epithelial cell type, which includes serous, mucinous, clear cell, endometrioid, and Brenner tumors. However, among the epithelial neoplasms, benign lesions are more common than malignant neoplasms, and other entities (including nonneoplastic masses) are far more common causes of a pelvic mass. Imaging studies (ultra-sound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) can depict the tumor morphology: solid or cystic, unilocular or multilocular cystic, with or without thickening of the walls or septa, with or without papillary excrescences or other soft-tissue elements, and with or without calcifications. Evaluation of these morphologic characteristics allows attempted differentiation among malignant, benign neoplastic, and nonneoplastic lesions. Lesion characterization assists in surgical planning. Malignant neoplasms nearly always require laparotomy, whereas benign neoplasms may be managed laparoscopically. In the case of ovarian carcinoma, treatment is primarily surgical, and most patients also receive chemotherapy. Unfortunately, recurrence is common."

In 1973, the World Health Organisation classified ovarian neoplasms into nine major categories and 26 subtypes, based on histologic cell type and benign versus malignant state. The literature review concerning functional ovarian cysts in girls has been presented. Functional cysts are not true neoplasms but rather should be considered a variation of a normal physiologic process. Functional cyst include follicular, corpus luteum, and theca-lutein types, all of which are benign and usually self-limited. The incidence of functional cysts in the community is probably even higher than indicated in most series, as percentages are based on referred cases and it is not possible to determine the underlying incidence of nonidentified or asymptomatic cysts.

There are only two previous case reports,which is evident from our literature review from January 1960 through January 2010. Acute abdomen is one of the greatest diagnostic challenges and easily ignored by the clinicians to exclude the possibility of gynecologic illness. A 35-year-old woman was referred by the doctor in Family clinic. She experienced a three-day period of severe right lower abdominal pain and intermittent vomiting. Ultrasonography identified a bilocular, cystic, hypoechoic, and hyperechoic tumor, 7 cm × 6 cm × 6 cm in the right adnexal region. Laparoscopic cystectomy was performed under the impression of ovarian cyst with torsion or hemorrhage. The frozen section was benign and appendiceal status was adequate. Histopathologic examination described an ovarian cyst composed of endometrial-type lining with stromacells (endometriosis) and benign teratoma tissue with plenty of skin appendages and sebaceous glands. We report this unusual and interesting ovarian mass to remind physicians that the usage of the Endobag after cystectomy, the benefits on minimizing operative time, spilled opportunity, and postoperative complications. Laparoscopic techniques for large ovarian masses might be considered. The experience of the surgeon is also very important to prevent misdiagnosis or complication. Further follow up is mandatory for this simultaneous finding of ovarian endometriosis with coincidental dermoid cyst as a separate pathology in single ovary of such a nature. It also presents a challenge to the clinicians and to the pathologists."
CD009786,0,11977327,0,Diagnostic value of US and CT in the assessment of ovarian teratomas and their qualifications for surgical treatment with laparoscopic method.,"In the group of 17 women after surgery with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of teratomas diagnostic usefulness of US and CT was analysed. Differentiated echostructure of tumours was correlated with different densities of pathologic tissues in CT examination, also after their contrast enhancement. In 2 patients teratomas of both ovaries were recognised, in the remaining 15 women tumours were unilateral. In total morphologic pictures of 19 teratomas were assessed, 9 times tumours with prevailing liquid component had the picture of a thick-walled cyst, 7 times these were hyperechogenic fatty foci and in 3 cases had the character of solid tumours. Teratomas had different morphologic pictures, but it was possible to show the prevalence of one element and classify the tumour to one of the three types of teratomas. It was found that US examination, due to its high frequency, lets early diagnose teratomas before they are accessible in the clinical exam, in the symptomless period or when they give indirect symptoms, usually dysuric ones. CT examination, due to its high sensitivity in recognising fatty tissue and calcifications, is necessary before laparoscopic operation requiring fragmentation of big tumours to determine their character."

Forty-nine ovaries in 25 consecutive infertility patients undergoing microlaser surgery for deep ovarian endometriosis or polycystic ovarian disease, refractory to medical treatment, were evaluated from October 1981 through March 1983. All patients subsequently underwent a second-look nonlaser laparoscopy to evaluate the extent of healing and to bluntly lyse any subsequent adhesions with the Olympus laparoscope (Olympus Corporation, Lake Success, NY) second-puncture probe: 36.7% of the ovaries had recurring adhesions, 83.3% of these adhesions were mild and filmy and 16.7% were moderate and dense. Additionally, four ovaries were viewed approximately 1 year postoperatively, with two ovaries that previously had mild and filmy adhesions lysed at 6 weeks having no recurrent adhesions. The actual pregnancy rate in this study is 60%, with 15 of the 25 patients conceiving at least once and 2 patients conceiving twice. The majority of pregnancies occurred within the first 6 months postoperatively, with the longest initial pregnancy occurring 22 months postoperatively.

The authors performed a retrospective study during the period January 2008 to December 2009 in the Second Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Aretaieion University Hospital; 19 women with large ovarian cysts were included in the study. During the study period, 53 women underwent laparoscopic excision of ovarian cysts. Among them, 19 had very large complex ovarian cysts with a mean diameter of 8.4 cm. The mean age of the patients was 32.1 years. Ultrasound examination revealed findings suggestive of benign disease in all patients. In 8 out of 19 patients CA-125 levels were elevated, ranging from 40.5 to 194.7 IU/mL. A 5-mm suprapubic trocar was directly inserted into the cyst and fluid contents aspirated, so the decompressed cyst could fit in a 5-cm laparoscopic bag. The cyst wall was carefully detached from the healthy ovarian tissue and placed in the bag without any spillage. The remaining cyst wall was removed from the peritoneal cavity with the laparoscopic bag. The mean operative time was 45 minutes. No operative or postoperative complications were noted. There was no conversion to laparotomy. Mean hospital stay was 1 day. Pathology revealed 7 endometriomas, 3 mucinous cystadenomas, 3 serous cystadenomas, 3 serous cysts, and 3 teratomas. Direct trocar insertion within the ovarian cyst followed by aspiration of the fluid contents is a safe and feasible method for the laparoscopic management of large ovarian cysts."

A 30-year-old woman underwent excision of a right submandibular adenoid cystic carcinoma followed by regional external beam radiation therapy. Three years later, she underwent extended hepatic resection and localized radiotherapy to the hepatic region for metastatic disease. The patient was without evidence of disease for 7 years when she developed pelvic pain and a pelvic mass was found. A solid and cystic 10-cm left ovarian mass and a single metastatic tumor nodule involving the right ovary were excised via the laparoscope. Histologically, the tumor was identical to the patient's initial salivary gland neoplasm. The neoplastic cells were CAM 5.2 positive, S100 positive, muscle-specific actin positive, and smooth muscle actin positive. Ultrastructurally, characteristic pseudocysts (pseudolumina) with abundant basal lamina and true glandular lumina lined by short microvilli were present. Other than a single anecdotal account of a parotid gland adenoid cystic carcinoma, this case represents the first documented report of an adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary gland origin that was associated with symptomatic ovarian metastases. This case demonstrates that the ovary is a potential site for metastatic disease many years following the diagnosis and treatment for a primary neoplasm however uncommon or remote the site of origin. Since metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma can rarely present as an ovarian mass, a clinical history of this neoplasm should be heavily weighed in the differential diagnosis of any unusual ovarian tumor with a predominant cribriform, trabecular, or tubular pattern."

Patients received 50 mg/m2 cisplatin and 50 mg/m2 doxorubicin every 21 days for six cycles. Eighteen patients had complete surgical staging defined as total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and aortic node sampling, omentectomy, and cytology. Eight patients had all of the above with the exception of node sampling. The overall median follow-up for the group is 43+ months. Three patients had grade 1 tumors with positive washings or capsule invasion and are disease free with a median follow-up of 53+ months. Of 23 patients with grade 2-3 tumors, 22 are alive and free of disease with a median follow-up of 42+ months. There has been 1 recurrence, at 18 months, in a patient who had complete staging and a grade 2 tumor. The patient recurred with carcinomatosis, documented by laparoscopy. There was no significant hematologic, neurologic, or renal toxicity encountered in any patient.

It is attractive to continue treatment of these patients with intraperitoneal (ip) delivered chemotherapy. From 1981 through 1984 a Tenckhoff catheter was implanted in 59 women for ip chemotherapy after a staging laparoscopy or laparotomy. Minor complications occurred in 8 patients and could be treated conservatively. Ten patients suffered major complications, leading to three (re)laparotomies and catheter extraction in 7 of 10 patients. No patient died of complications, but mean hospitalization time of patients with major complications was 25 days as compared to 11 days for patients without complications. An analysis of nine factors that could lead to postoperative complications failed to reveal a statistically significant risk factor. From this study no profile of a typical high-risk patient emerges."

Two women developed abdominal distention, one of whom had been receiving medical treatment for known tuberculosis. In both cases, ultrasonography showed a pelvic mass and ascites associated with high levels of CA 125. A transabdominal ultrasonographically-guided biopsy of the masses with a trucut needle established their tuberculous origin.

CD009786,0,11802556,0,[Laparoscopy and gynecologic cancer: is it still necessary to debate or only convince the incredulous?].,"Many papers suggested that laparoscopic treatment of cancer could be achieved and taught safely. Although cases reports about trocar site metastasis and national survey about inadequate management of early ovarian cancer suggested that laparoscopic management of cancer may be dangerous. The current literature may be summarized as follows. An inadequate surgical management performed by laparoscopy as well as by laparotomy may worsen the prognosis of an early ovarian cancer. If the abdominal wall is protected with a bag and the tumour is not morcellated, the incidence of trocar site site metastasis is about 1%. Animal studies demonstrated that the laparoscopic management of cancer has both advantages and disadvantages. Preliminary results from prospective randomised trials in the treatment of colon cancer suggested that the survival rate is similar after laparoscopy and after laparotomy. The risk of dissemination appears high when a large number of malignant cells are present in patients operated using an increased abdominal pressure and a CO2 pneumoperitoneum. These data suggest that laparoscopic treatment of gynaecologic cancer is not dangerous if an adequate surgical technique is used. However morcellation of suspicious solid tumours, treatment of adnexal tumours with external vegetations but without peritoneal dissemination and of bulky lymph nodes should be considered as contra-indications to CO2 laparoscopy, puncture of an ovarian tumour with intracystic vegetations is a high risk situation which should be avoided whenever possible."

For a young woman with stage IA disease who wishes to preserve fertility, conservative surgery with laparoscopic techniques can be a safe and effective method. Three patients with clinical presumptive stage IA GCT of the ovary were initially treated with conservative laparoscopic surgery with intraoperative rupture of the tumor. On repeat surgical exploration, all 3 patients were found to have peritoneal disease. Postoperative chemotherapy was required. Several important aspects of laparoscopic management of adnexal masses are highlighted by these 3 case reports. A thorough knowledge about GCT is important.

CD009786,0,8015759,0,Management of early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer.,"Because ovarian cancer is asymptomatic until the late stages of the disease and because accurate methods of early detection are lacking, only about 40% of these cancers present in stages I and II. As a result, ovarian carcinoma remains the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy in the United States. However, proper management of early cases may lead to a good prognosis for long-term survival and, in some cases, may even permit preservation of reproductive capacity. The appropriate management of these early cases includes meticulous and thorough staging at the time of the initial surgery. In women who do not desire further reproduction, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be carried out. In those who eagerly wish to maintain reproductive potential, the uterus and contralateral ovary may be preserved, providing certain criteria have been met. Patients with stage Ia or Ib grade 1 disease can be followed-up without further therapy after definitive surgery; those with Ic or grade 3 tumors should receive adjuvant therapy. Patients with stage I epithelial ovarian cancer who are without evidence of disease after comprehensive staging surgery and primary adjuvant chemotherapy do not require second-look laparotomy. In the future, laparoscopy will play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and management of early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer."

Bilateral tubal occlusion was noted on hysterosalpingogram, and a right adnexal cyst, initially thought to be of ovarian origin, was identified by office transvaginal sonography. Laparoscopy revealed a 5.5-cm, fluid-filled mass involving the distal aspect of the right fallopian tube. Both ovaries and uterine exterior appeared grossly normal. The cyst was decompressed and removed intact without incident through a 5-mm laparoscopic cannula. The mass showed histologic features consistent with benign serous cystadenofibroma.

The technique has been associated with less postoperative pain, a better cosmetic result and a shorter period of hospitalization. The early optimism has been followed by the doubts based on the observation of port site metastasis after laparoscopic surgery for neoplastic diseases. Port site metastases have been reported without a sure explanation of their cause: gas turbulence and exfoliated cells, contaminated instruments or limited experience of surgeon.

The surgeon was alerted to the EUS finding prior to the planned laparoscopic colectomy. On retrospective review of the CT pelvis after surgery, the radiologist could still not diagnose the ovarian lesion separated from the primary rectal tumor due to their close proximity.

On the other hand, there are a lot of limitations to the use of laparoscopic surgery in the management of early ovarian cancer, and open surgery remains a standard. Laparoscopic surgery is used in there assessment of inadequately staged apparently early ovarian cancers. In the case of obviously advanced ovarian cancer, laparoscopic examination may help to decide whether to propose upfront surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Laparoscopy may also be used in the follow up of previously treated patients. Prophylactic oophorectomy is routinely performed using laparoscopic surgery."

Proper intraoperative assessment and liberal use of rapid frozen section are also important for optimal clinical outcome. Reported studies show that laparoscopic management of adnexal masses can be safely done. The short hospital stay and rapid return to normal activity combine to potentially reduce the overall cost of patient care. When cancer is unexpectedly found at the time of laparoscopic surgery for an adnexal mass, the surgeon should be prepared to proceed with staging laparotomy for appropriate treatment."

CD009786,0,16787549,0,Managing ovarian masses during pregnancy.,"The management of adnexal masses during pregnancy can be challenging for the patient and the clinician. The specter of a possible malignancy can sway the decision for intervention versus expectant management. The etiologies of ovarian masses are reflective of the patient's age; and, therefore, benign entities such as functional ovarian cysts, benign cystic teratomas, and serous cystadenomas predominate. In the unusual cases when cancer is present, they are typically germ cell and borderline ovarian tumors, and are commonly low stage and low grade. Ultrasound is the primary modality used to detect ovarian masses and to assess the risk of malignancy. Morphologic criteria more accurately identify benign cysts compared with malignant tumors. Tumor markers are used primarily to monitor disease status after treatment rather than establish the ovarian tumor diagnosis as a result of lack of specificity, because several markers can be elevated inherent to the pregnancy itself (eg, CA-125, beta-hCG). Expectant management is recommended for most pregnant patients with asymptomatic, nonsuspicious cystic ovarian masses. Surgical intervention during pregnancy is indicated for large and/or symptomatic tumors and those that appear highly suspicious for malignancy on imaging tests. The extent of surgery depends on the intraoperative diagnosis of a benign versus a malignant tumor. Conservative surgery is appropriate for benign masses and borderline ovarian tumors. More aggressive surgery is indicated for ovarian malignancies, including surgical staging. Although rarely necessary, chemotherapy has been used during pregnancy with minimal fetal toxicity in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer in which the risk of maternal mortality outweighs the fetal consequences."
CD009786,0,10584186,0,Laparoscopy combined with conventional operative techniques.,"In order to establish minimal invasive methods further, it should be guaranteed that laparoscopy is not only performed in a few pediatric surgical centers. A simple approach to gain experience would be the performance of diagnostic laparoscopy. However, benefit could be increased if the surgeon combines the minimal invasive laparoscopy to establish the diagnosis with the conventional surgical technique to continue. This approach for example applies to complicated cases of appendicitis. In a combined procedure, even bowel resections and tumor extirpations can be performed with minimal invasion. In twenty-seven cases--11 appendicectomies, 14 resections of cystic ovarian tumors and 2 resections of Meckel's diverticulum--we applied this technique and found no complications so far. The surgical method presented is convenient and safe."

Adequate hydration with alkalinization prevented nephrotoxicity and no cumulative myelosuppression was observed. Serum MTX levels in nontoxic patients averaged 1 X 10(-6) M 24 hours following a 30-minute iv infusion of MTX at 3 g/m2. Among nontoxic women there was a 50-fold difference in the MTX level which correlated with the mean serum creatinine level. Response was assessed after 6--12 weeks of treatment by laparoscopy in patients with nonpalpable intra-abdominal tumor implants or by physical examination in patients with palpable masses. Despite the high levels of MTX achieved with the weekly schedule, only one partial response occurred among eight patients with visible or palpable metastatic lesions. Progressive disease was observed after 6--12 weeks of treatment in four of eleven women who began to receive MTX without evidence of disease or with lesions of less than 1.5 cm in diameter. MTX at the dose and schedule used in the present study appears to be of no benefit in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer."

Peritoneoscopy has made a large impact on the staging and follow-up of patients with ovarian cancer. Lymphangiography, combined more recently with ultrasonography or computerized tomography, appears to be especially useful in evaluating patients with cervical cancer for lymph node metastases outside the usual radiation treatment fields. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography are useful for evaluating masses for resectability and treatment response, planning radiation therapy, detecting metastases and ascites, and directing thin-needle aspiration of masses. Thin-needle aspiration techniques are now available which provide a means for sampling areas which were previously inaccessible except to open operative biopsy or where biopsy might result in serious complications."

We present the case of a 38-year-old patient complaining of an increase in her abdominal circumference. Consequently, a vaginal examination, a transvaginal ultrasound and an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis were carried out. It should be noted that a preoperative diagnosis of GISTs is uncommon, due to the rarity and many presentations of the disease. Ultrasound and MRI are not able to differentiate a GIST from ovarian cancer. However, if a pelvic mass is detected, the possibility of a non-gynaecological tumor has to be considered."

Twenty-nine responders (19%) reported a total of 42 cases of ovarian malignancy. The laparoscopic procedure was aborted or the cyst was aspirated in 38% of the cases, and partial or complete excisions were attempted in 33 and 29%, respectively. The characteristics of the masses were as follows: less than 8 cm 67%, cystic 62%, unilocular 48%, and unilateral 81%. All four ""benign"" characteristics were present in 31% of the cases found to be malignant, and three of four characteristics were present in 24%. Laparotomy was performed at the time of laparoscopy in 17% of cases, after laparoscopy in 71% with an average interval of 4.8 weeks, and not at all in 12%. Fifty-seven percent of the cases were invasive epithelial malignancies, whereas 29% were tumors of low malignant potential. At least 50% of the patients had stages II-IV. We conclude that attempted laparoscopic excisions of adnexal masses that are subsequently found to be malignant are not uncommon, and that the presence of so-called ""benign"" characteristics does not preclude malignancy. Attempts at partial or complete excision are common, as are delays in subsequent definitive surgery. The stage of disease is often advanced, and all histologic types of malignancy are encountered. We advocate careful evaluation of this practice, with development of strict guidelines to ensure optimal patient care."

At the completion of a chemotherapy program, direct visualization of the peritoneal cavity is necessary to accurately assess the amount and location of residual tumor. Laparoscopy, with visually directed biopsies of residual tumor masses, can spare some patients a laparotomy and yet provide a safe and easy route for assessment of intraabdominal disease. If residual tumor is not seen at laparoscopy, than laparotomy with multiple peritoneal biopsies must be done so that residual tumor will not be missed and chemotherapy prematurely stopped. Laparoscopy is not an alternative to ""second look"" laparotomy but is a useful adjunct for determining the presence of resectable, unresectable or diffuse disease after chemotherapy."

We examined the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic laparoscopic oophorectomy for premenopausal breast cancer. Prophylactic laparoscopic oophorectomy was attempted in 15 selected premenopausal patients with breast cancer. After mastectomy, these patients had laparoscopic ovarian ablation as treatment for breast carcinoma with positive estrogen receptors. To evaluate the economic impact of laparoscopic oophorectomy, comparisons were made between patients treated laparoscopically and those treated with conventional surgery, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. The average time required for laparoscopic bilateral oophorectomy was 44 min. Oral intake was resumed the next morning, and the patients were discharged 3 days after surgery. No limitation on physical activity and no complications were required during postoperative days. There was no reduction in the overall costs of laparoscopic surgery and conventional surgery in Japan. The cost of one year's supply of tamoxifen was equivalent to the overall cost of surgical oophorectomy.

The predictive value of the number of chemotherapy cycles to achieve a serum CA125 of < 35 U/ml is compared to the predictive value of s, the rate of achieving a normal serum CA125. s is generated from an exponential regression model. This study suggests that s accurately predicts which patients have residual disease at reassessment laparotomy, who will be free of disease, and, of those in the latter group, who are at greatest risk to recur, as well as overall survival. If these observations are confirmed, physicians may base further therapeutic intervention on the basis of a calculated parameter following complete clinical response to first-line treatment rather than relying on findings at reassessment laparotomy."

Treatment of acute PID is very important as it can reduce the risk of sequelae. However, follow-up, partner treatment and counselling are also useful to reduce the reinfection rate. Few weeks after PID, clinical evaluation as well as transvaginal and transabdominal sonography must be performed. The interest of systematic bacteriological tests is not proved. Hysterosalpingography and second-look laparoscopy should be considered only for women with infertility and severe infection. Use of condom is advisable in this population in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STD) including HIV and to decrease rate of recurrence, associated to contraceptive pill, which is also a good option. In selected cases, intrauterine devices can be used in patients with history of PID if the infection is resolved and no significant risk factors for STD exist. Infertility and chronic pelvic pain are the most common sequelae in the population of young women with severe and recurrent infection.

CD009786,0,8038406,0,The role of laparoscopic surgery in gynecologic oncology.,"As a result of recent technological advances, laparoscopic lymphadenectomy is becoming the standard method for the staging of pelvic cancer. More extensive procedures, such as para-aortic lymph node dissection and radical hysterectomy, have also been demonstrated to be feasible by advanced laparoscopic surgery. This new approach appears to be very promising. In the future, because of its well documented advantages, laparoscopic surgery may appear as a way to decrease the morbidity of cancer treatment in patients with low-risk tumors and to propose more aggressive treatments of patients with tumors associated with a poor prognosis. These new techniques should be reserved for surgical teams trained in oncologic and major laparoscopic surgery. More clinical research is required before this approach can be proposed as an alternative to laparotomy, and guidelines have to be established. Training in oncology is essential to ensure optimal patient care and to avoid the consequences of inadequate laparoscopic management with regard to cases of tumor dissemination reported after laparoscopic biopsy or resection of undiagnosed ovarian cancer."

There are no data in literature on the presence of dendritic cells derived from peritoneal fluid monocytes/macrophages. In our study we tried to culture PF macrophages from patients who undergone surgery so that to obtain dendritic cells. PF was aspirated during laparoscopy from patients with endometriosis, unexplained infertility or benign noninflammatory ovarian tumor. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated using adherence method then were cultured and stimulated with GM-CSF and IL-4. Phenotype of cultured cell was estimated using flow cytometry after incubation with monoclonal antibodies CD45/14, CD 40/HLA-DR, CD28/3, CD3/40L, CD25/5 and CD69/HLA-DR. Morphology of cultured cells was confirmed microscopically after May-Grunvald-Giemsa staining. PF leukocytes concentration varied from 1.2 x 10(6) cells/mm3 to 22.6 x 10(6) cells/mm3. Cultured monocytes/macrophages from PF had morphology typical for dendritic cells. We also found that only dendritic cells from patients with endometriosis had higher expression HLA-DR antigen (93.6% of cells) and low expression of CD40 (2.7% of cells) on their surface in comparison to reference group. It is worthy to notify that dendritic cells from patients with endometriosis expressed also CD25 antigen characteristic for T leukocytes.

CD009786,0,22764562,0,Ovarian cysts in adolescents: medical and surgical management.,"Contemporary management of ovarian cysts in the adolescent consists of conservative management, whether expectant, medical, or surgical. An understanding of ovarian physiology in the perimenarcheal and postpubertal patient supports ovarian preservation surgery, as the rate of malignancy is low and the alternative can be devastating. The most common ovarian cysts in adolescents are functional and often regress without further treatment. Symptomatic ovarian cysts warrant further investigation. Endometriomas arising from endometriosis are extremely uncommon. Tubo-ovarian abscesses are managed medically and rarely by drainage or surgery. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and prompt conservative operative management is indicated. Consideration of additional imaging, tumor markers, and surgical management of persistent or complex masses with ultrasound findings suspicious for malignancy is appropriate. This article reviews all these conditions and conservative management using laparoscopy as the preferred method if surgical intervention is needed. Unilateral removal of malignancies is advocated when possible."

CD009786,0,8455217,0,The role of sonographically guided aspiration in the clinical management of ovarian cysts.,"This study was undertaken to verify the role of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) followed by cytologic examination as a possible alternative to surgery in case of cystic pelvic masses. From January 1988 to March 1989, 204 patients with a proven cystic pelvic mass underwent FNA under sonographic guidance. In 20 cases the aspiration was performed transvaginally. Thirty-six patients were postmenopausal. In all cases the aspirated fluid was collected for cytologic evaluation. Other than one case of persistent hematuria, no complications occurred. The overall recurrence rate, verified 3 months from FNA, was 65%. Fifty-two per cent of patients developed a new cyst after a complete aspiration. Fifty-three patients underwent a laparotomy, allowing a comparison between cytologic and histologic patterns. The sensitivity of cytologic examination of aspirated fluids was 40% (3 of 5 malignancies were missed) and the specificity was 100% (no false positives were observed). We conclude that FNA might be proposed in young women with a unilocular ovarian cyst to avoid a surgical procedure. In postmenopausal women with a unilocular cystic mass 5 cm or less, FNA may be considered as an important step in the diagnosis. In all instances the ultrasonographic appearance of the cyst (echo texture and regularity of wall) and the characteristics of aspirated fluid are the most important findings. When the aspirated fluid contains mucus or blood, or when a complex mass is present, exploratory laparotomy or a laparoscopy is recommended."

CD009786,0,8835491,0,[Surgical therapy of ovarian carcinoma].,"Aim of primary surgery in early stage ovarian cancer (FIGO I-IIA) is a complete removal of all visible tumors and an exact staging of intraabdominal and retroperitoneal tumor spread. Debulking of tumor as radical as possible is the aim of surgery in advanced stages of disease (FIGO IIb-IV). After 2 to 3 cycles of an active polychemotherapy interventional debulking surgery is performed with the intention to remove all existing tumors in those patients with postoperative residual tumor masses > 1 cm in diameter after first surgery. Second-look surgery is performed after 6 cycles of first line polychemotherapy either to confirm a clinical complete remission pathohistologically or to debulk persisting residual tumors. Secondary tumordebulking and its influence on survival as well as the diagnostic value of second-look surgery is discussed controversially, so today second-look is confined to clinical protocols. Cytoreduction of relapsing tumor masses seems to prolong survival in those patients with a relapse free interval of more than 12 months. This seems to be an attractive therapeutic alternative. For the future one can expect more selective operation strategies on the basis of new biologic prognosticators and new developments in minimal invasive operation techniques."

Very rare secretory Brenner tumours (BT) have been described, generally after the menopause. A 31-year-old woman sought medical advice for secondary amenorrhoea, progressive hirsutism and a 5-year history of virilisation syndrome with clitoromegaly. Testosterone was markedly high (285 ng/dl, N<85) with moderate elevation of delta 4-androstenedione (D4AD) (311 ng/dl, N <270), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (366 μg/dl, N <340) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) (275 ng/dl). LH was 9 IU/l, FSH 4.3 IU/l, estradiol 60 pg/ml and progesterone 314 ng/100 ml. Cortisol was decreased (1.3 μg/dl) after the dexamethasone suppression test. Pelvic MRI showed a 5-cm right ovarian tumour with a 2.5 cm nodular component and cystic areas, and two nodules measuring 11 mm and 15 mm above the right and left ovaries. After right ovariectomy by laparoscopy, pathological examination concluded on a 3-cm SLCT and a 2-cm BT; the nodules above the ovaries were dysembryoplastic cysts. Postoperatively, testosterone level was normal after 24 h (26 ng/dl), estradiol and progesterone rapidly decreased, cyclic secretion then resumed and the patient menstruated at day 27.

For the patient with uterine cancer, surgery is necessary for staging, control of symptoms and cure. With the advent of the da Vinci(™) intuitive robot, alternative surgical options can now be offered to these patients. While surgery is the principal modality for the treatment and management of uterine cancer, the morbidly obese patient faces increased complications and longer postoperative recovery. As studied in the LAP2, comparable outcomes have been noted in laparotomy vs laparoscopic surgery. Recently, minimally invasive surgery has been refined with the advent of the da Vinci robotic system. Applying a minimally invasive technique further enhanced with the da Vinci robotic system, a total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed on a patient with a BMI of 98."
CD009786,0,12057051,0,Advanced ovarian cancer.,"State-of-the-art treatment for advanced ovarian cancer requires a multimodality approach. Aggressive surgical debulking with the goal of optimal cytoreduction is the initial step. After primary cytoreductive surgery, standard treatment for patients with stage III and IV disease is systemic combination chemotherapy consisting of six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Approximately 70% of patients enter a clinical remission with this approach, yet less than 30% remain disease free. Options following primary therapy include observation or second surgical assessment if no clinical evidence of disease is present. Novel strategies for consolidation are needed. Second-look surgery can be performed safely and effectively laparoscopically, and this is the most accurate means of identifying patients who appear to be clinically free of disease but actually harbor persistent cancer. Although this procedure is an extremely accurate means of identifying these patients, women who have pathologically negative second-look surgery are still at risk for relapse. Patients can receive additional treatment following second-look surgical assessment via the intraperitoneal route if they are pathologically negative or if they have microscopic or small volume disease. Alternatively, additional systemic chemotherapy can be given with non-cross-resistant systemic agents, but no current standard approach for consolidation therapy exists for patients following the completion of primary treatment. Unfortunately, most patients relapse. Multiple agents with similar activity in phase II trials are available to treat patients with advanced recurrent disease. Combination therapy in this setting has not been shown to have significantly superior progression-free or overall survival compared with single agents. The selection of treatment for patients with recurrent disease is currently based on a determination of the treatment-free interval since last treatment, as well as the route, schedule, and expected side effects of the agent."

The authors report about a 4-year-old girl who developed a late bone marrow and cutaneous relapse of her pre-B-cell ALL and revealed an enlargement of her left ovary (4 x 3 x 2 cm). Chemotherapy (ALL-REZ-BFM pilot-protocol 2002) achieved effective remission, but the ovarian mass depicted no regression. Laparoscopic adnexectomy was performed and the tumor could be extracted in a specimen-bag through a 12-mm umbilical incision. Histology detected no viable lymphoblasts, but a fibrotic enlargement due to previous cellular infiltration. The authors conclude that in children with ALL relapse and an ovarian tumor, malignant infiltration as well as local response to chemotherapy can be judged only by surgical excision and histopathologic examination. Laparoscopic oophoradnexectomy is a valuable management option in these children."
CD009786,0,20059391,0,Laparoscopic excision of infarcted accessory spleen.,"An accessory spleen is present in about 10-30% of the population and, usually, does not cause symptoms. We present a case report of an unusual presentation of accessory spleen infarction, with a literature review. A 12-year old male presented with acute left-upper quadrant pain that slowly resolved. An ultrasound and computed tomography scan showed a 3.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm solid mass abutting and displacing the splenic flexure of the colon, with surrounding inflammatory changes. This was interpreted as a colonic duplication cyst, and the boy was treated with antibiotics and underwent elective laparoscopic exploration. It was removed laparoscopically without complication and, on pathologic examination, proved to be consistent with an infarcted accessory spleen. Less than two dozen similar cases of accessory spleen infarction have been reported in the literature, most presenting with acute abdominal pain. Preoperative diagnoses included appendicitis, ovarian torsion, neoplasm, and, in our case, colonic duplication. The natural course of infarcted accessory spleen would be to atrophy, but, even with advanced imaging techniques, it may be impossible to diagnose infarcted accessory spleen with enough confidence to avoid surgery."

In 2000 women over 45 years old, without any evidence of adnexal disease, pelvic examination and serum CA-125 determination were performed. When either the findings of the pelvic examination were ambiguous or positive, or the serum CA-125 level was > 35 U/ml, further investigation including ultrasonography and laparoscopy or laparotomy was done. Among 174 women with clinical findings of adnexal disease there were 15 (8.62%) who had serum CA-125 > 35 U/ml. Among 18 women with elevated serum CA-125 (> 35 U/ml) there were 15 women (83.33%) who had clinical findings of adnexal disease. In 15 women further investigation was suggestive of adnexal disease and surgical exploration revealed three cases of malignancy. One case of serious ovarian cystadenocarcinoma stage Ia, one case of borderline ovarian tumour and one case of metastatic carcinoma from the right kidney. The other 12 women had benign adnexal masses or pelvic endometriosis. In our study this combined approach had sensitivity 100%, specificity 99.70% and P.P.V. 22%. According to these data, the procedure could be a potential component of a strategy aimed to the early detection of ovarian cancer, regardless of the financial cost."

Histology revealed this to be an intestinal type mucinous borderline tumour (IMBT). In view of this, a semi-urgent laparoscopic appendicectomy was carried out. The appendix was histologically normal. IMBT of the ovary is a mucinous tumour with atypical proliferation of the goblet cell containing epithelium. It is known to occur simultaneously with tumours of the appendix. Paediatric surgeons need to be aware of this rare tumour and when operating on any ovarian pathology should always inspect the peritoneal cavity for mucinous deposits and examine the appendix."
CD009786,0,20181551,0,VEGF hypersecretion as a plausible mechanism for pseudo-meigs' syndrome in advanced colorectal cancer.,"We present a case of pseudo-meigs' syndrome caused by a metastatic ovarian tumor of rectal cancer origin, and examine the possible involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathogenesis of refractory fluid retention. A 42-year-old woman with advanced rectal cancer underwent a laparoscopic anterior resection of the rectum. During systemic chemotherapy treatment, she complained of severe abdominal distension 16 months following the operation. We failed to improve massive ascites by diuretics and repeated abdominocenteses. Without any definite evidence of carcinomatous peritonitis, we chose to extirpate an enlarged ovarian tumor on the presumptive diagnosis of pseudo-meigs' syndrome. Ascites disappeared promptly after resecting the ovarian tumors and the subject resumed systemic chemotherapy. Preoperative high levels of serum VEGF were normalized promptly after the operation. Levels of VEGF expression in metastatic ovarian tumors were as weak as in the primary tumor upon immunohistochemical staining. In contrast, increased VEGF expression was evident in epithelial cells of oviducts. For patients with massive and refractory ascites, we need to keep in mind the disease entity of pseudo-meigs' syndrome, since surgical intervention possibly improves conditions. Furthermore, the hypersecretion of VEGF from oviducts may play a role in the pathogenesis of clinical manifestations of pseudo-meigs' syndrome."
CD009786,0,8571460,0,The value of transvaginal color Doppler in the assessment of pelvic inflammatory disease.,"This study compares transvaginal color and pulsed Doppler (TVCD), laparoscopic and clinical findings in 102 women with proven pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Seventy-two (72) of them had acute symptoms, 11 presented with chronic pelvic pain and 19 patients were infertility cases suspected of tubal etiology. Uterine sonographic findings were demonstrated in 72 patients (70.6%). Free fluid in the cul-de-sac was demonstrated in 39 (38.2%) patients. Ovarian enlargement as the only finding was demonstrated in 6 (5.9%) patients, 22 (21.6%) presented with tubular adnexal structure, while in 74 (72.5%) patients it was of a complex nature. Color flow was obtained in all 6 patients presenting with ovarian enlargement, in 12 (54.5%) of those presenting with tubular adnexal structure, and in 56 (75.7%) of those with complex adnexal mass. Ovarian morphology was clearly delineated from adnexal mass in 59 patients (55.9%). The ipsilateral ovarian flow was altered in 50 of them (84.7%). The mean resistance index (RI) in patients with acute symptoms was 0.53 +/- 0.09 (+/-SD). It significantly differed from those obtained in patients with chronic pelvic pain (RI = 0.71 +/- 0.07) and infertility cases (RI = 0.73 +/- 0.09).

Since subdiaphragmatic air can persist for up to 24 days, clinical decisions are generally made on the basis of other findings."

Women are living longer with ovarian cancer, and the survival for all cases in the U.S. has increased. Some, but not all, of this success is secondary to new surgical approaches. New techniques, new philosophies and new technology have changed the surgical approach to ovarian cancer in a variety of clinical situations, and these changes have affected the care of women with ovarian cancer. Access to specialist surgeons continues to be very important in the care of women with ovarian cancer to ensure adequate staging, optimal cytoreduction and application of secondary cytoreduction when appropriate. Further work needs to be undertaken in screening, prevention, surgery and adjuvant therapy."
CD009786,0,2971904,0,Excision of pelvic endometriosis with the carbon dioxide laser laparoscope.,"Laparoscopic vaporization of peritoneal endometriosis has been reported to relieve pain and enhance fertility. However, vaporization of endometriosis, particularly large plaques and hemorrhagic areas, is associated with significant amounts of carbon deposition in the desicated tissues. Further, it is difficult to ascertain complete removal of disease in some areas. In this study, 66 patients were treated by excision of peritoneal and/or ovarian endometriosis with the carbon dioxide laser via laparoscopy. Using excisional techniques, we were able to visualize the extent of peritoneal penetration and subperitoneal spread of endometriotic nodules. Further, we obtained histologic confirmation of the disease process in all patients. No patient received postoperative hormonal therapy during follow-up. Follow-up evaluation of these patients revealed relief of the painful symptoms of endometriosis. No long-term complications were encountered."

Ninety-six patients completed 6 months of therapy at a dosage of 800 mg daily, and 107 patients completed therapy with 400 mg daily. No difference was reported in the incidence of side effects, regardless of dosage. Gross resolution of disease (as determined by second-look laparotomy or laparoscopy) was evaluated in 110 patients and found to be similar, regardless of dosage. Ovarian endometriosis greater than 1 cm was observed to respond significantly less well to danazol than peritoneal or ovarian disease less than 1 cm. Pregnancy rates for 157 patients with no other discernible causes of infertility were slightly higher for the 800-mg danazol regimen than for the 400-mg regimen. In patients with mild disease, the use of danazol alone resulted in pregnancy rates lower than those achieved with conservative surgery alone. Its use preoperatively for all stages of disease resulted in slightly higher pregnancy rates than when conservative surgery alone was employed. Danazol was less effective when used postoperatively. No differences were observed between three classification schemes in their ability to predict subsequent prognosis for conception."

The aim of the study is to evaluate indications and feasibility of laparoscopy and video-assisted prophylactic gonadectomy in children with Ullrich Turner syndrome (UTS) or 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis (GoDy). Between 1996 and December 2002 five girls with UTS and nine patients with 46,XY GoDy (female gender role) were explored by laparoscopy. Video-assisted salpingo-oophorectomy or gonadectomy was performed using a three-port technique. Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy was exclusively performed in UTS patients with proven presence of translocated parts of the Y chromosome. In three patients with 46,XY GoDy laparoscopy was followed by surgical revision of the groin and open gonadectomy in four patients. In two cases with UTS the removed streak gonads contained small unilateral tumours stage pT1a, and in four cases of 46, XY GoDy histopathological investigation revealed bilateral neoplasms stage pT1b. We found the following tumour types: gonadoblastoma, dysgerminoma, testicular intraepithelial neoplasia, and mature teratoma. In conclusion, investigative laparoscopy gives a good image of the internal genital structures and allows the safe removal of the dysgenetic gonads during the same operation. The high rate of gonadal tumours underlines the indication for early gonadectomy in these patients."

CD009786,0,23440802,0,Laparoscopic surgery for presumed benign ovarian tumor during pregnancy.,"The surgical management of ovarian tumors in pregnancy is similar to that of non-pregnant women. The procedures include resection of the tumor (enucleation), removal of an ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy), or surgical excision of the fallopian tube and ovary (salpingo-oophorectomy). The procedure can be done by open surgery (laparotomy) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) technique. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery include shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activity, and reduced postoperative pain. However, conventional laparoscopic surgery techniques required the infusion of gas carbon dioxide in the peritoneum to distend the abdomen and displace the bowel upward to create the room for surgical manipulation. Serious complications such as abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the circulating blood (hypercarbia) and perforation of internal organs have also been reported. These serious complication may be harmful to the fetus."

An ovary-conserving method was developed for outpatient surgical removal of benign cystic teratomas by minilaparotomy in teenagers. The technique requires no specialized training, laser devices, or expensive disposable instrumentation. As a precaution, the first teenager in whom the technique was used was observed as an inpatient for 3 days. Following this, the method was used as an outpatient procedure in three further cases. No complications occurred in any of the four patients, and the mean operating time of 85 minutes (range, 60 to 95 minutes) was similar to the reported time for removal of benign cystic teratomas by laparotomy. Although a randomized controlled study with many more patients would be necessary for a definitive conclusion, considerable cost savings and reduction in morbidity over traditional laparotomy are suggested by this experience."

The response was evaluated through repeated laparoscopy with multiple biopsies and serial measurement of Ovarian Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125); 11/36 patients had a complete (6 patients) or partial (5 patients) response. Toxicity (both local and general) was observed starting from 25 mg/m2 of M per cycle. The amount of drug reaching systemic circulation was monitored by measuring M plasma value after i.p. treatment. This study showed wide variations in serum levels obtained after i.p. doses ranging from 23 to 36 mg/m2. The area under the curve (AUC) of mitoxantrone plasma samples, did not correlate with the i.p. administered dose. Conversely, a correlation seems to exist between the plasma AUC and the responder status.

CD009786,0,1388132,0,Pelviscopic treatment of ovarian cysts in premenopausal women.,"Between 1984 and 1989, 773 patients less than or equal to 45 years of age, presenting with a total of 809 ovarian cysts, underwent pelviscopy at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Kiel University. In 36 cases, cysts were bilateral. 678 cysts (84%) were treated by pelviscopy alone. Organ-preserving treatment was performed in 83%, oophorectomy or adnexectomy in only 17% of cases. Two stage Ia ovarian carcinomas (0.26% of all cysts) were operated on by pelviscopy before laparotomy. Sonography is particularly important in determining whether a pelviscopic approach is appropriate. Pelviscopic procedures are unacceptable in multilocular cysts measuring greater than or equal to 7 cm in diameter with echo-dense components. Special caution is required for any cyst measuring greater than 9 cm in diameter. The risk of opening a malignant cyst must be weighed against the advantages of pelviscopic surgery: minimal physical strain, better postoperative quality of life, and organ conservation. In doubtful cases, laparotomy is recommended."
CD009786,0,18336393,0,Timing of debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer.,"It is clear that primary debulking remains the standard of care within the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage III and IV). This debulking surgery should be performed by a gynecological oncologist without any residual tumor load, or so-called ""optimal debulking."" Over the last decades, interest in the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy together with an interval debulking has increased. Neoadjuvant therapy can be used for patients who are primarily suboptimally debulked due to an extensive tumor load. In this situation, based on the randomized European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Gynaecological Cancer Group trial, interval debulking by an experienced surgeon improves survival in some patients who did not undergo optimal primary debulking surgery. Based on the GOG 152 data, interval debulking surgery does not seem to be indicated in patients who underwent primarily a maximal surgical effort by a gynecological oncologist. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can also be used as an alternative to primary debulking. In retrospective analyses, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery does not seem to worsen prognosis compared to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, we will have to wait for the results of future randomized trials to know whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is a good alternative to primary debulking surgery in stage IIIc and IV patients. Open laparoscopy is probably the most valuable tool for evaluating the operability primarily or at the time of interval debulking surgery."

In the last two decades, treatment of these tumors in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at our hospital has depended on the stage of the disease and the age of the patient. It ranged from laparoscopic cyst extirpation to hysterectomy with bilateral adnectomy and omental resection and regional lymphnodectomy. From the end of 1985 to the end of 1992, 35 patients with borderline tumors of the ovaries were operated on. Histologically, 14 borderline tumors were mucinous, 21 were serous. A follow-up investigation was carried out five to 11 years after primary operation. In this period, no patient died of borderline tumor. Twenty-eight patients who were followed up were clinically free of recurrence, five patients are alive, but could not be followed up. Two patients have died of other diseases after five years. Only one patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. She could not be followed up. In the meantime, peritoneal implants were demonstrated at second-look laparoscopies in four out of 18 patients. Later, these could no longer be demonstrated (one patient) or did not affect the survival time (three patients) and thus ultimately was not pathologically relevant. Primarily, two of these four patient had stage Ia-Ic. The paraffin blocks of the preparations are still available from 26 patients, and additional investigations could be carried out. Nineteen percent of the borderline tumors showed micropapillary structures of an MPCS (= micropapillary serous carcinoma), which evidently did not have a negative effect on the prognosis. All borderline tumors showed diploid distributions in DNA cytometry. It is not possible to make a definitive treatment recommendation on the basis of this investigation because the number of patients followed up was too small."

The method requires the cutting of a window in the cyst wall through the laparoscope fenestration. In preference to aspiration at laparoscopy or removal at laparotomy, this method has the advantage of ensuring histologic material as well as permanent drainage by the use of atraumatic surgical technique. Nineteen cysts were fenestrated laparoscopically. Four cysts could not be classified, two owing to lack of histologic material, two owing to malpreparation of the selected cyst tissue. In one case an epithelial cyst--a mucinous cystadenoma, being laparoscopically unsuspected--was fenestrated. One cyst recurred.

The amount of residual tumor following primary surgery was an important prognosis factor. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a new therapeutic approach. Secondary, optimal surgery could be done in better conditions. The purpose was to access the ability of preoperative abdominopelvic CT to predict success of debulking surgery for ovarian carcinoma: less than 1 cm of residual tumor size after initial surgery. We reviewed 39 patients (2 stages Ic, 1 stage IIc, 22 stages III and 14 stages IV) operated on for ovarian carcinoma between January 1992 and December 1997. Surgical criteria of inability to perform optimal surgical cytoreduction were compared with abdominopelvic CT done the month before.

CD009786,0,17006424,0,[Laparoscopic treatment of adnexal cystic masses].,"Operative laparoscopy has become the gold standard for the surgical treatment of numerous gynecological benign conditions. In the case of ovarian cysts, however, the use of the laparoscopic approach has been debated due to the possibility of encountering an unexpected ovarian malignancy at the time of surgery. This would upstage a IA or IB ovarian malignancy to IC. In this review, the authors evaluate the preoperative parameters that could help in the selection of the patients who are candidate to a laparoscopic approach. In particular, the authors consider the age related risk of the patients, the use of sonography and color-Doppler velocimetry, the use of CA 125, and as a last diagnostic step, the findings at laparoscopy. In a personal series of 1.584 cysts in patients under 40 years of age, the first author encountered 7 unexpected borderline tumors and 1 mucinous G1 adenocarcinoma, while no malignancy was found in a group of strictly selected postmenopausal patients. These data have been compared with those found in scientific literature. There is no sound evidence that the stripping procedure determines a reduction of the ovarian reserve when performed with strict microsurgical principles. Recent evidence in the literature suggests that the decreased ovarian responsiveness reported by some authors following ovarian cystectomy may not be a consequence of surgery. The concern of a possible reduction of the ovarian reserve needs to be balanced with the benefits obtained with surgery.

Debulking surgery should be performed by a gynaecologic oncologist without any residual tumour load, or so called optimal debulking'. Over the last decades, interest in the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy together with an interval debulking has increased. Open laparoscopy is probably the most valuable tool for evaluating the operability primarily or at the time of interval debulking surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy can be used for patients that are primarily suboptimally debulked due to an extensive tumor load. In this situation, based on the randomized EORTC-GCG trial, interval debulking by an experienced surgeon improves survival in some patients who did not undergo optimal primary debulking surgery. Based on the GOG 152 data, interval debulking surgery does not seem to be indicated in patients who underwent primarily a maximal surgical effort by a gynecological oncologist. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can also be used as an alternative to primary debulking. In retrospective analyses neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery does not seem to worsen prognosis compared to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, we will have to wait for the results of future randomized trials to know whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is a good alternative to primary debulking surgery in stage IIIc and IV patients."
CD009786,0,6385256,0,Staging and surgical evaluation of ovarian cancer.,"Ovarian carcinoma is the only female genital malignancy surgically staged. Appropriate preoperative roentgenographic, isotopic, and endoscopic studies can help define the spread of disease and the extent of surgery required. At surgery, the common sites of metastases--pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, diaphragm, serosal surfaces and omentum--should be examined and biopsied or excised. Total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and appendectomy should also be performed in patients with epithelial ovarian tumors. Evidence suggests that patients who have had optimal cytoreduction of the tumor (less than 1.5 cm) have a better outcome following chemotherapy. Patients who have no clinical or CT evidence of disease after a full course of chemotherapy should be explored to confirm disease status. Peritoneoscopy can be used as an interval procedure to assess response to treatment."
CD009786,0,8714064,0,[Laparoscopic surgery in gynecology. Experience at the Luis Castelazo Ayala Hospital].,"The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the various applications of the laparoscopic surgery in the field of gynecology. 40 patients who were submitted to laparoscopic surgery were studied and divided into 5 groups accordingly to the surgical procedure: adhesiolysis, surgery of ovarian tumors, hysterectomy, surgery of the Fallopian tube and myomectomy. All the patients had a preoperative study and once completed they were selected for laparoscopic surgery. The laparoscopic procedure was able to solve the gynecologic pathology. The mean overall surgical time was of 66.8 min with a maximum time of 180 and a minimum of 30 min, accordingly to the groups the surgical mean times were as follows: 1) adhesiolysis 111 min 2) ovarian surgery 69 min 3) hysterectomy 113 min 4) tubal surgery 60 min and 5) myomectomy 58 min. There were no surgical complications and they all had a brief hospitalization period and a fast return to active life. All procedures were done with a bipolar cautery. We conclude that laparoscopic surgery is a useful resource for the resolution of the majority of the benign gynecologic pathology and when indicated in the proper way there is no rise in the morbid-mortality, and offers a short hospitalization period and a quick return to active life."

On occasion, the general surgeon may encounter ovarian fibroma while operating an acute abdomen. We present a series of 15 ovarian fibromas encountered in 13 patients over 11 years experience in our general surgical ward. Only four cases required emergency operations due to either tumors or adnexal torsion. High-resolution ultrasound scan with color Doppler suggested an ovarian fibroma in only ten cases, while CT and MRI were suggestive for the diagnosis in three other cases. Surgical treatment consisted of five ovarectomies, three adnexal resections and five total hysterectomies with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Seven patients underwent laparoscopic surgery, four of them for an ovarian resection and in three for an adnexectomy. Laparoscopic approach has significant advantages by limiting parietal aggression with better cosmetic results, short hospital admission, lower costs, few postoperative adhesions and rapid recovery."

Retrospective study from 1979 to 1989 at the Foch hospital].,This is a retrospective study carried out between the years 1979 and 1989 to look at the anatomopathology of tumours and ovarian cysts occurring in women over 50 years of age who had operations in our department. We found a raised incidence of malignant tumours (30%) when a late diagnosis is made (70% diagnosed at stages 3 and 4). There was a higher incidence of fibrothecomas (10%) along with the nine tumours. This is an important finding because functional cysts have only been found in non-menopausal women or in women who have recently had their menopause who have been taking hormone replacement therapy. Ovarian cysts in menopausal women are therefore primarily organic. This result makes it possible to outline a therapeutic regime specifically designed for the menopausal women. In effect the proposed treatment would either be laparoscopic surgery or laparotomy because it is very doubtful whether ultrasound puncture should be carried out because one cannot be sure that it is not a malignant cyst. The authors take the occasion of this study to view the complimentary tests that can be carried out for ovarian cysts. These are mainly ultrasounds and estimations of CA125. The therapeutic methods that are available are then transparietal cystectomy or intraperitoneal cystectomy or intraperitoneal cystectomy which means laparotomy with removal of the cyst.

However, present detection techniques are not very effective, and symptoms are more commonly seen in later stage disease. Amino acids, structural proteins, and enzymatic cofactors have endogenous optical properties influenced by precancerous changes and tumor growth. We present the technical details of an optical spectroscopy system used to quantify these properties. A fiber optic probe excites the surface epithelium (origin of 90% of cases) over 270 to 580 nm and collects fluorescence and reflectance at 300 to 800 nm with four or greater orders of magnitude instrument to background suppression. Up to four sites per ovary are investigated on patients giving consent to oophorectomy and the system's in vivo optical evaluation. Data acquisition is completed within 20 s per site. We illustrate design, selection, and development of the components used in the system. Concerns relating to clinical use, performance, calibration, and quality control are addressed. In the future, spectroscopic data will be compared with histological biopsies from the corresponding tissue sites. If proven effective, this technique can be useful in screening women at high risk of developing ovarian cancer to determine whether oophorectomy is necessary."

Although ovarian cancer is a significant cause of mortality in menopausal women, large population-based studies demonstrate that the majority of adnexal masses are benign. Despite this, the appearance of an adnexal mass is a concern for the patient and an insight exercise for physicians. In most cases, an adnexal enlargement is an incidental finding, generally corresponding to a benign cyst and easily diagnosed by conventional ultrasound. Exceptionally an ovarian tumour may be malignant and should be treated as early as possible. When conventional ultrasound renders complex morphology other diagnostic tools must be used such as: colour Doppler and functional tumour vessel properties, serum CA 125 levels, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and in some cases laparoscopy. Several new tumour markers are being studied for clinical application, although there are presently no clear recommendations. Adnexal masses with benign morphological and functional properties must be periodically monitored as an alternative to surgery since malignant transformation is exceptional."

Her left ovary had been removed at the age of 38 years old for a benign cyst and vaginal hysterectomy was performed one year later for cervical carcinoma. She had taken premarin 0.625 mg daily since her surgeries. Initial hormonal studies revealed elevated serum concentrations of total testosterone 524 ng/dL (N: 6-86 ng/dL), free testosterone 20.9 pg/mL (N: 0.3-2.7 pg/mL), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone 270 ng/dL (N: < 70 ng/dL); but normal baseline concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, androstenedione, and cortisol. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the adrenals and ultrasonography of the pelvis were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis similarly were non-revealing. She was given glucocorticoids without effect. Subsequently, retrograde selective venous sampling showed a marked testosterone gradient in the right ovarian vein. A laparoscopic right oophorectomy was performed and a 11 mm Leydig cell tumour of hilus cell type was detected on histologic examination. Postoperative testosterone levels returned to normal and she had slow regression of hirsutism. Our case illustrates that a virilizing ovarian neoplasm can be small and elude imaging studies.

CD009786,0,15742862,0,Conservative laparoscopic management of ovarian teratoma torsion in a young woman.,"Benign cystic tumors, specifically dermoid or mucinous cysts, are the most frequent causes of ovarian torsion. In clinical practice, adnexal torsion is usually subjected to adnexectomy to prevent embolism of thrombosed ovarian veins and its sequelae. However, this intervention is unsatisfactory for young women who want to preserve their fertility. In such situations, conservative management with untwisting of the adnexa, followed by cystectomy to preserve part of the ovary, would be a better option. In this report, we present a case of adnexal torsion due to cystic teratoma. A 25-year-old unmarried woman with lower abdominal pain and nausea was referred to our emergency room with suspicion of an ovarian mass. Ultrasonography showed a left ovarian mass measuring 9.7 x 6.5 x 6.2 cm with heterogeneous components within it. Laparoscopy showed an enlarged, dusky left ovary with torsion. Detorsion was performed and followed by cystectomy. The pathology revealed cystic teratoma of the ovary. We report this case to emphasize that untwisting of potentially viable adnexa, followed by cystectomy, in patients with adnexal torsion appears to be a safe procedure. This conservative approach should be encouraged in women of childbearing age to reduce the possibility of premenopausal loss of ovarian function."

Ninety-four (48.9%) patients developed recurrent disease after a median time of 18 months (range, 4-89 months) from surgical reassessment. The recurrence involved the pelvis in 45 (47.9%) cases, the abdomen in 42 (44.7%), the retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 13 (13.8%), and distant sites in 20 (21.2%). On the whole series, 5- and 7-year disease-free survival rates after negative second-look were 47.4 and 44.5%, respectively. By log-rank test the disease-free survival rate was related to FIGO stage (P = 0.008), tumor grade (P = 0.0021), size of residual disease after initial surgery (P = 0.0038), and type of second-look (laparoscopy vs laparotomy, P = 0.0061), but not to histological type and first-line chemotherapy. Cox proportional hazard model showed that tumor grade, size of residual disease, and type of second-look were independent prognostic variables for disease-free survival. The risk ratio of relapse was 2.386 (95% CI, 1.140-4.990) for grade 2 and 3.118 (95% CI, 1.515-6.416) for grade 3 compared to grade 1 disease. For patients with residual disease 1-2 cm and > 2 cm the risk ratio was, respectively, 1.877 (95% CI, 1.117-3.156) and 2.156 (95% CI, 1.324-3.511) compared to patients with residual disease < 1 cm. The risk ratio was 1.826 (95% CI, 1.121-2.973) for patients who were submitted to a laparoscopic second-look compared to those who underwent a laparotomic reassessment. Poorly differentiated grade and large residual disease after initial surgery are the strongest prognostic variables for recurrence after a negative second-look."

Because of its simplicity, fine needle aspiration cytology may be used as an alternative to surgical procedures. However, because of the great variety of tumor types in the ovary, cytologic interpretation of aspirates from that organ represents one of the most challenging fields in diagnostic cytology. Nevertheless, as clinicians become more experienced in using this technique and pathologists gain confidence in their ability to evaluate samples correctly, aspiration cytology may prove to be one of the most valuable and acceptable tools in the diagnosis of tumors of the female pelvis."

These transducers made it possible to visualize the gallbladder and bile ducts and evaluate for the presence of stones, to detect masses and provide guidance for their aspiration or biopsy, and to image the internal structures of the ovary and fallopian tube. In addition, these miniature transducers were used to locate such normal vital structures as blood vessels, thereby allowing the surgeon to decide on the best approach for dissection during mediastinoscopy. During conventional surgery, the surgeon or gynecologist can palpate an area of abnormality not directly visualized. However, during laparoscopy and mediastinoscopy direct palpation is not possible. Therefore, it is important to find another method to determine what structures lie beneath the visualized surface. These miniature ultrasound transducers appear to offer a means for making such determinations."

CD009786,0,21944035,0,Primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer.,"Advanced ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis. De-bulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy are the cornerstones of the treatment. Primary debulking surgery has been the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer. Recently a new strategy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery has been developed. In a recently published randomised trial of the EORTC-NCIC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - National Cancer Institute Canada) in patients with extensive stage IIIc and IV ovarian cancer it was shown that the survival was similar for patients randomised to neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking compared to primary debulking surgery, followed by chemotherapy. The post-operative complications and mortality rates were lower after interval debulking than after primary debulking surgery. The most important independent prognostic factor for overall survival was no residual tumour after primary or interval debulking surgery. In some patients obtaining the goal of no residual tumour at interval debulking is difficult due to chemotherapy-induced fibrosis. On the other hand the patients randomised had very extensive stage IIIc and IV disease and in patients with metastases smaller than 5 cm the survival tended to be better after primary debulking surgery. Hence, selection of the correct patients with stage IIIc or IV ovarian cancer for primary debulking or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is important. Besides imaging with CT, diffusion MRI and/or PET-CT, also laparoscopy can play an important role in the selection of patients. It should be emphasised that the group of patients included in this study had extensive stage IIIc or IV disease. Surgical skills, especially in the upper abdomen, remain pivotal in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. However, very aggressive surgery should be tailored according to the general condition and extent of the disease of the patients. Otherwise, this type of aggressive surgery will result in unnecessary postoperative morbidity and mortality without improving survival. Hence, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should not be an easy way out, but is in some patients with stage IIIc or IV ovarian cancer a better alternative treatment option than primary debulking. According to the current treatment algorithm at the University Hospitals Leuven about 50% of the patients with stage IIIc or IV ovarian cancer are selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
CD009786,0,10422684,0,Advanced ovarian cancer patients with no evidence of disease after platinum-based chemotherapy: retrospective analysis of the role of second-look.,"From 1981 to 1992, 230 previously chemotherapy-untreated epithelial ovarian cancer patients (Stages IIb-III or IV) received platinum-based polychemotherapy at our Division. In this presentation, time to progression and overall survival rates were retrospectively analyzed in 89 epithelial ovarian cancer patients (stage IIb, c - III or IV) with no clinical evidence of disease (clinical complete remission--CCR--in 26 patients with postsurgical residual tumor > or = 2 cm, and no clinical evidence of disease--NED--in 63 patients with post-surgical residual tumor < 2 cm) after first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy. After at least 6 courses of chemotherapy, 62 patients (group A) were submitted to second-look (SL) laparotomy (n=47) or laparoscopy (n=15); 27 patients (group B) did not undergo second-look surgery because of patient refusal, the surgeon's decision or clinical contro-indications to surgery. Groups A and B were comparable in terms of post-surgical residual tumor (< 2 cm: 71% vs 70%), median Performance Status (WHO: 1) and median age (56 vs 57 yrs). FIGO stage IIb, c was more frequent in group B (26% vs 18%--p=0.004). In 9/18 (50%) patients with clinical CR and in 31/44 (70%) NED patients no residual tumor was confirmed at SL (pathological CR--pCR). After a median follow-up of 10 years (range 5-16 years), 72% (64/89) of patients relapsed and 65% (58/89) died. Survival was significantly longer in patients with pCR (median survival 76 months vs 32, 29 and 16 months for patients with pPR, pNC or pPD, respectively, p=0.0001). Multivariate analysis identifies pCR as the only significant prognostic factor exerting an influence on survival after second-look laparotomy (p=0.0000). This study confirms that the second-look can provide an important prognostic evaluation in patients without evidence of disease after chemotherapy for ovarian cancer stages III-IV."

CD009786,0,1835528,0,Indications and general techniques for lasers in advanced operative laparoscopy.,"Lasers are but one of the several energy delivery systems used by the operative laparoscopist in the performance of advanced operative laparoscopy. Safety is a key factor in the selection of a laser because the tissue damage produced by this instrument is absolutely predictable. The surgeon must be totally familiar with the chosen wavelength and its tissue reaction if this safety factor is to be realized. Other instruments complement the use of lasers in advanced operative laparoscopy, and without thorough knowledge of all available techniques and instruments, the operative laparoscopist will not achieve the full potential of this specialty. It is beyond the scope of this issue on gynecologic laser surgery to present all of the useful nonlaser techniques. Suffice it to say that we often use laser, loop ligature, sutures, hemoclips, bipolar electricity, hydrodissection, and endocoagulation during the course of a day in the operating room and sometimes during one case. As enthusiasm for advanced operative laparoscopy grows and endoscopic capability increases, more complicated and prolonged surgical feats are reported. Radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy have been performed by the laparoscopic route, and endoscopic management of ovarian tumors also has been reported. At this moment, these must be viewed as ""show and tell"" procedures unsupported by statistics to demonstrate any advantage (or disadvantage) when compared with conventional surgical methods. The time required of advanced operative laparoscopy for any given procedure is certainly an important factor. Prolonged operative and anesthesia time certainly can negate the supposed benefit of small incisions and minimally invasive surgery. What goes on inside the abdomen is certainly the most important part of advanced operative laparoscopy. Good surgeons must recognize their own limitations and the limitations of available technology. The operative laparoscopist must know when to quit and institute a laparotomy. In general, when the magnitude of the operative laparoscopy greatly increases the time required to perform the surgery or exceeds the capability of the surgeon, laparotomy is necessary. Patients should never be promised that an operation will be done by laparoscopy. In advanced operative laparoscopy, informed consent means that the patient has had a reasonable explanation of the method, its benefits and its dangers, and has also been told that laparotomy is always a possibility. In our large series, the laparotomy rate is about 3%. It is also wise not to promise the patient that advanced operative laparoscopy will be done by the laser.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009786,0,8587744,0,An overview of consumer-driven ambulatory surgery: operative laparoscopy.,"Laparoscopy is considered one of the first truly consumer-driven medical advances. It is estimated that 30% to 70% of all gynecologic surgery currently performed via laparotomy incision could be completed by using the laparoscope. The emerging trend in recent years is the change from using the laparoscope in gynecology for diagnosis and tubal sterilization to treating ectopic pregnancy and ovarian neoplasm. The 1991 and 1992 Gynecologic and Obstetrical Society's review and recommendations of this surgical specialty reflect a 1.5-fold increase in the number of laparoscopic procedures reported in 1988. Pelvic pain is the most frequent indication for operative laparoscopy. There is a need for further evaluation of laparoscopy, including an evaluation of cost-savings claims and an evaluation of necessary recovery time in comparison with laparotomy. Primary care providers can effectively monitor patients' potential surgical needs and appropriately counsel patients when armed with knowledge of the benefits and risks of operative laparoscopy.

Whilst a clear pathogenetic role for endometriosis resulting in tubo-ovarian distortion and infertility is obvious, a causal role for mild endometriosis in infertility has not been established. Any one of several factors may result in both endometriosis and infertility. Nevertheless, endometriosis is best treated at the time of diagnosis in order to limit progression of the disease. The preferred method of treatment is medical, with surgery being reserved for those endometriotic lesions not responding to medical treatment. Conservative surgery will not eradicate microscopic foci, and it is possible that the surgery itself may result in adhesion formation. The choice of medication should be individualized, as the side-effects may not be readily tolerated by some women. Maintenance of amenorrhoea may not be essential to therapeutic efficacy, as normally sited and ectopically sited endometrial tissue may respond to hormonal manipulation in different ways."

Six of these procedures were performed in the office. Four patients had previous malignancies (lung, breast, and fallopian tube), and intraperitoneal recurrences or new primaries were suspected. In two of these patients, laparoscopically directed biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma similar to their prior malignancies, and in one a new primary was diagnosed. The fourth patient had no evidence of intraperitoneal disease. In the three patients with new intraperitoneal malignancies, biopsies obtained laparoscopically confirmed adenocarcinomas of the ovary in two patients and of the gastrointestinal tract in one patient. We feel that this procedure is a safe, simple, effective, and economical way to evaluate the intraperitoneal cavity and to obtain histologic or cytologic specimens for evaluation in patients with intraperitoneal malignancies. This is an ideal, minimally invasive method for detecting small-volume intraperitoneal disease. In addition, it allows some patients to be spared major operative procedures."

Patients with invasive cervical carcinoma can be spared radical hysterectomy if laparoscopy documents positive lymph nodes. Therapeutic laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy has been performed successfully in patients with small cervical lesions. Laparoscopy can be used for staging in patients with advanced cervical cancer who are scheduled for definitive radiotherapy. Laparoscopically assisted surgical staging is also feasible, safe, and adequate in patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer, and is being investigated in patients with stage I ovarian cancer. Second-look laparoscopy is proving useful in ovarian cancer patients who are candidates for a second-look procedure. Laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy is being investigated in patients with small stage I vaginal carcinoma who are being considered for treatment with brachytherapy alone."
CD009786,0,10150435,0,A comparison of laparotomy and laparoscopy in the management of ovarian masses.,"To compare the results of laparoscopy with laparotomy in the management of ovarian masses not suspected of being malignant, a retrospective review was made of 115 patients with ovarian masses operated on, 50 by laparotomy and 65 by laparoscopy, in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, from November 1, 1992, to October 31, 1993. In the laparoscopy group, the average size of the ovarian masses was smaller, and there was a significant reduction in the intraoperative blood loss, postoperative analgesic requirement, morbidity (particularly febrile morbidity and urinary retention), length of hospital stay, and recuperation period. The incidence of rupture of the ovarian mass was not related to the operative approach but to the underlying pathology. Two patients in the laparoscopy group were converted to laparotomy, and 1 in the laparotomy group required a second laparotomy. The operating time was longer in the laparoscopic approach, but this could be reduced with experience and improved technique in specimen removal. Laparoscopy appears to be a better approach than laparotomy in the management of ovarian masses where malignancy is not suspected and a competent surgeon is available."

CD009786,0,7988849,0,"[When may, should, must the ovary by removed--with which technique?].","The growing demand for minimally invasive operative processes and the unmistakable progress in pelviscopy, have led to an extension of the indications for minimally invasive surgery. At the same time, the operative treatment of ovarian cysts is the third most frequently performed pelviscopic operation. The indication for ovarectomy depends, above all, on anamnestic factors, the clinical findings and the results of pre-operative vaginal sonography. In the event of inadequate hormone secretion by the ovaries, the indication for organ removal should be generously applied. Vaginal sonography is not capable of proving or excluding the existence of a malignancy with 100% certainty. The average rate of ovarian carcinomas is 2.6% in case of smooth-walled, unicamerate cysts. Pelviscopy is also unable to differentiate reliably between benign and malignant ovarian tumours. With the aid of pelviscopic operative processes, a cystic ovarian tumour cannot be extirpated in toto with the necessary certainty. In spite of the conflicting results in the literature, an iatrogenic rupture of an early ovarian carcinoma can be expected to result in worsening the prognosis. The Department of Obstet. Gynecol. University of Göttingen, adopted the following procedure: 1. A (mini-) laparotomy with immediate section for microscopic examination is always performed on sonographically suspect ovarian tumours. 2. On smooth-walled unicamerate ovarian tumours > or = 3 cm which persist or fail to respond to treatment with oral contraceptives, (mini-) laparotomy is performed with complete extirpation of the cystic ovarian tumour and immediate section for microscopic examination; a conceivable alternative is, if possible, total pelviscopic extirpation of the ovarian cyst with immediate section for microscopic examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A 38-year-old woman with a 17-year history of primary infertility presented with lower abdominal pain and granulomatous inflammation in the endometrial biopsy. Bilateral adnexal masses measuring 4 and 6 cm in size were detected and the serum cancer antigen 125 level was 141 IU/ml. Laparoscopic surgical exploration and frozen section on the resected tubes revealed bilateral fallopian tube adenocarcinoma and then a staging laparotomy was performed. Histopathological examination showed a primary bilateral Grade 2 tubal serous adenocarcinoma of Stage 1b associated with granulomatous salpingitis. Primary fallopian tube carcinomas in young women are extremely rare gynecological tumors that are infrequently diagnosed prior to surgical exploration and their cause is unknown. A definitive diagnosis could be made on the histopathological examination in our case with the evidence of chronic pelvic inflammation. Our findings suggest that chronic pelvic inflammation may play a role in carcinogenesis in the tubes of infertile women.
CD009786,0,7867272,0,The potential value of magnetic resonance imaging in infertility.,"The potential value of magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool in infertility was investigated. Twenty-six women with primary or secondary infertility and symptoms of dysmenorrhoea or menorrhagia were studied prospectively using conventional T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo techniques. Positive diagnoses were obtained in 20 of 26 (76.9%) patients. Of these, 18 (69.2%) had lesions likely to be significantly contributing to infertility. Adenomyosis was detected in 14 patients (53.8%) with 11 showing the diffuse pattern while three had discrete adenomyomas. Cystic lesions typical of endometriosis were detected in seven patients (26.9%), four of these also had evidence of adenomyosis. The endometriotic lesions were also seen at laparoscopy in each case. Five patients (19.2%) had leiomyomas, one in a patient with adenomyosis and endometriosis and one in a patient with endometriosis alone. Only one patient had submucous leiomyomas causing significant distortion of the endometrial mucosa likely to affect fertility. Magnetic resonance imaging is valuable in the investigation of unexplained infertility where it provides a high diagnostic yield particularly if uterine pathology is suspected."

All metastases occurred in patients with FIGO stage IIIC-IV including ascites. Survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that after adjustment for age, FIGO stage, histology, grade, ascites, and residual disease after primary debulking, the presence of abdominal wall metastases in the entry sites of previous laparoscopy or paracentesis was negatively, although not statistical significantly, correlated with survival (P = 0.14)."

We describe the fourth case reported in the literature of Sister Mary Joseph's nodule originating from fallopian tube carcinoma. In a 54-year-old woman, Sister Mary Joseph's nodule was unexpectedly detected during umbilical hernia repair. Subsequent laparoscopy revealed a 2-cm friable tumor located at the fimbriated end of right fallopian tube and 1-cm peritoneal implant in the pouch of Douglas. Laparoscopic bilateral adnexectomy and resection of the peritoneal implant were performed. Because frozen section examination revealed fallopian tube carcinoma, the procedure was continued with laparotomy including total abdominal hysterectomy, omentectomy, and pelvic lymph node sampling. Final diagnosis was stage IIIB fallopian tube carcinoma. The patient received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent carboplatin and has remained alive and with no evidence of disease. It is concluded that in cases of Sister Mary Joseph's nodule, laparoscopy can be a useful tool in the search of the primary tumor in the abdomen and/or pelvis. Laparoscopy can provide crucial information with respect to the location, size, and feasibility of optimal surgical resection of the intraabdominal and/or pelvic tumors."

Subgroups of young patients with early stage ovarian cancer, endometrial carcinoma and cervical carcinoma may be considered to be at relatively low risk of recurrence and may be treated conservatively with the aim to preserve fertility when this is of prime concern. Unilateral adnexectomy with preservation of the contralateral ovary and uterus may be appropriate for some patients with epithelial ovarian cancers, and certainly should be the procedure of choice for those young women with borderline tumors and early stage sex cord-stromal and malignant germ cell tumors. Administration of high-dose progestins may obviate the need for immediate hysterectomy in a young patient with a well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma desirous of childbearing. The performance of vaginal radical trachelectomy in conjunction with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomies has emerged as a real breakthrough for a highly select group of young women with early invasive tumors of the cervix.

However, this is often difficult on routine MR images because both blood and lipid within tumors can have the same signal intensity as subcutaneous fat. Accordingly, we studied the value of lipid- and water-suppression MR images in making this distinction in 16 patients (21 lesions). As proved by surgery (six patients) or laparoscopy (10 patients), there were 16 endometriomas, one hemorrhagic leiomyosarcoma, and four lipid-containing mature cystic teratomas. The signal intensity in all 17 hemorrhagic lesions was greater than that of subcutaneous fat on lipid-suppression images and less than that of fat on water-suppression images. This compared with the signal intensity of the four lesions that contained lipid, in which the signal intensity was similar to that of subcutaneous fat on both the lipid- and water-suppression images. Thus, the lipid- and water-suppression MR images allowed an accurate distinction between the two. Our experience suggests that the appearance of blood and lipid in ovarian tumors is sufficiently different on lipid- and water-suppression MR images to allow an accurate distinction between the two. The two techniques should be useful in the differential diagnosis of such lesions by MR imaging."

Before referral, only 25% of patients had an initial surgical incision that was adequate to allow complete examination of the pelvis and abdominal cavity. In patients referred to member institutions, 31 (31%) of 100 were found to have a more advanced stage and 23 (77%) of 31 of these actually had stage III disease. Sixty-one percent of the patients had their advanced stage detected by procedures other than a second laparotomy-nine (29%) of 31 by peritoneoscopy, six (19%) of 31 by peritoneal washings, and six (19%) of 31 by lymphangiography. Sites of unsuspected disease are most likely to be pelvic peritoneum, ascites fluid, other pelvic tissue, para-aortic nodes, and the diaphragms. Based on these data, we conclude that the initial staging approaches traditionally used in clinical evaluation of patients with early ovarian cancer are often incomplete and inadequate."

The authors report a case of a 10-month-old girl with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) who presented with bilateral inguinal hernias. Herniorrhaphy was uneventful. Microscopic examination of the hernia sacs showed exuberant mesothelial hyperplasia containing multiple nests of differentiated glial tissue. Subsequent computed tomography and laparoscopy disclosed normal ovaries with no evidence of intraabdominal or pelvic abnormalities. Gliomatosis peritonei in this case was attributed to transport of glial tissue from the cerebrospinal fluid into the peritoneal cavity via the shunt. With the exclusion of an ovarian germ cell neoplasm and in the presence of a VPS, the clinical course with regard to the glial implants in these children is uneventful. If it is appreciated that gliomatosis peritonei may be a complication of a VPS, an extensive clinical evaluation generally is unnecessary."

The data were compared with the corresponding serum levels. CA 125 levels in undiluted peritoneal fluid ranged between 41-301 U/mL and were significantly higher than levels in serum, except in cases of ovarian carcinoma. However, when CA 125 of peritoneal fluid was measured at dilutions greater than 1:50, higher antigen levels were measured (1120-31,500 U/mL), with the highest CA 125 values in patients with ovarian carcinoma. Measurements at dilutions of less than 1:50 were also affected but did not show any decreased binding of the antigen. Immunoblotting analysis of serum and peritoneal fluid indicated the presence of two main bands in each. The monoclonal antibody OC 125 reacted strongly with peritoneal fluid CA 125, in agreement with the CA 125 values obtained by immunoradiometric assay using high dilutions. These data suggest that CA 125 measurements in peritoneal fluid are unreliable unless the samples are diluted 1:50 or more. Furthermore, the statistical difference found between patients with benign and malignant tumors and those with leiomyomata uteri and controls suggests that diluted peritoneal fluid could have a role in identifying abnormal antigen levels."

They report 33 cases exclusively treated by laparoscopic surgery in a series of 407 adnexal cysts treated over a 4-year period (April 1988 to April 1992). As regards diagnosis, the principal difficulty is not to miss the odd malignant lesion (1 to 2%) encountered mainly in older women. Technically, the most delicate stage in the operation is extraction of the cyst, especially when it is large and has an important solid component. Provided all precautions are taken in the diagnosis and the operative technique, this new method seems to be quite acceptable as it enables women who carry these lesions, which require excision, to benefit from the well-known advantages of laparoscopic surgery."

CD009786,0,10949421,0,Ovarian masses in the newborn.,"Prenatal sonography uncovers many fetal ovarian masses that previously would have gone unrecognized. This challenges clinicians to learn the natural history of these asymptomatic lesions so as to provide the best care postnatally. Spontaneous resolution of simple ovarian cysts is expected by about 6 months of age, which is attributed to predicted changes in the postnatal hormonal milieu. After birth, levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and estrogen plummet. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) rise until about 3 months of age and then fall as the ""gonadostat"" matures. Although symptomatic cysts demand intervention, simple asymptomatic cysts less than 5 cm in diameter should be left alone but reassessed sonographically. If simple cysts are larger than 5 cm in diameter the risk of torsion may be significant, and intervention often is advocated. However, the risk of torsion versus the likelihood of resolution is not well established. The therapeutic goal for a clinician managing a newborn with a simple ovarian cyst is to maximize ovarian salvage. Aspiration alone may be a reasonable option. The laparascopic approach to the neonatal ovarian cyst provides a view of both ovaries and allows aspiration, unroofing, cystectomy, or ovariectomy. The sonographically complex cyst usually represents adnexal torsion but could be a neoplasm and warrants intervention because the morbidity from untreated neonatal adnexal torsion can be significant beyond loss of the ovary (eg, hemorrhage, peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, or a wandering tumor)."

CD009786,0,6225603,0,Laparoscopy in the management of patients with ovarian carcinoma.,"Since operative evaluations of patients undergoing therapy for ovarian cancer are necessary, the laparoscope will continue to play a role in the management of these patients. However, the sensitivity of the laparoscope for detecting disease either prior to or at the completion of chemotherapy is significantly less than that of laparotomy, and therefore its utility must be more narrowly defined. The morbidity of laparoscopy is low when performed correctly and utilizing techniques to avoid bowel perforation. Most patients require only a brief hospitalization, and those who cannot medically tolerate an extensive laparotomy might be able to undergo a laparoscopy. The major limitations of laparoscopy are the inability to adequately inspect the peritoneal cavity and pelvis in at least one-quarter of patients because of extensive adhesions, to assess retroperitoneal lymph nodes in all patients, and to resect tumour masses necessary to cytoreduce the tumour prior to therapy. The successful performance of interval laparoscopy, however, is predictive of survival and can select a group of patients whose likelihood of recurrence is relatively low (30 per cent) after more than three years. The observation that the majority of patients who have a negative laparoscopy following six months of chemotherapy remain free of disease for several years, suggests that sensitive tumours are most likely to respond during the initial courses of chemotherapy, and that consideration should be given to briefer and more intensive courses of therapy prior to operative evaluation of the patients."

Use of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for monitoring gestational trophoblastic neoplasia has set the standard to which other assays must be compared. Beta hCG and alphafetoprotein have provided useful markers for ovarian germ cell tumors. Recently, a monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay for CA 125 antigen has been used to monitor the treatment of epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Persistent elevation of CA 125 in serum has generally reflected persistence of disease at second look surveillance procedures. CA 125 levels can, however, return to within normal limits and residual disease can be found at laparoscopy or laparotomy. CA 125 shows promise for distinguishing benign from malignant pelvic masses. Trials are currently underway to evaluate the potential of CA 125 in combination with other markers to facilitate earlier detection of occult ovarian cancer."
CD009786,0,2288867,0,Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of infertile women.,"Infertility can be due to a variety of causes, ranging from genetic or endocrine disturbances to structural abnormalities. Imaging is often used in the evaluation of anatomic abnormalities. The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has greatly improved diagnostic accuracy in the workup of several entities causing infertility. Developmental abnormalities of the reproductive tract are particularly well suited to diagnosis by MRI, which clearly demonstrates the zonal anatomy of the corpus, cervix, and vagina. Correct classification of an anomaly can spare the patient unnecessary laparoscopy or surgery. Leiomyomas, another cause of infertility, are optimally evaluated by MRI, since the size, number, location, and extent of degeneration can be identified. These factors are important in deciding how the leiomyomas will be treated. Adenomyosis can cause uterine enlargement and can be misconstrued as fibroids. MRI is the only noninvasive method that can prospectively diagnose adenomyosis. Ovarian masses can also give rise to infertility. MRI is particularly well suited to clarify whether a mass is uterine or ovarian. It is also much more specific than ultrasound in the differential diagnosis of a mass, especially endometriomas, dermoids, and fibromas. Polycystic ovarian disease, usually diagnosed via hormonal measurements, also has a characteristic appearance on MRI."

The dilemma of predicting the risk of suboptimal cytoreduction in ovarian cancer.,"Although maximal cytoreduction is the cornerstone of current treatment for patients with advanced ovarian cancer, optimal cytoreduction is not always achievable in the clinic. Therefore, using clinical characteristics, diagnostic imaging, serum biomarkers or laparoscopic findings, many studies have attempted to find models for predicting surgical resectability. However, most of these prediction models showed limited effectiveness and have not been properly validated. To establish a reliable prediction model, several requirements should be met. First, the goal of surgical cytoreduction should be adequately defined. Second, the desired accuracy for making the model clinically useful should be defined. Third, the model should test all relevant predictors, including clinical, radiological and biochemical predictors, and be developed using a large dataset that provides a sufficient number of events. Fourth, any prediction model should be validated with a relevant external dataset. Lastly, the prediction model should be able to aid decision making and, thereby, improve the outcome of patients. Therefore, randomized clinical trials with decision making based on prediction models are urgently required."

The goal of each operation was to excise all tumors greater than 1 cm in diameter. This goal was achieved in 12 of 15 primary operations, in seven of nine operations after induction chemotherapy, and in three of four operations performed for tumor recurrence. There were two major complications but no postoperative deaths. Analysis of survival and disease status indicated that patients having operations followed by chemotherapy fared the best. Analysis of prognostic variables suggested that the administration of combination chemotherapy was the most important determinant of survival once the surgical goal had been accomplished. In this latter group, all nine patients who were evaluable by laparoscopy had responded to adriamycin-cyclophosphamide and eight of the nine had complete responses."

We have sought to assess the feasibility of the laparoscopic approach to a particular gynecologic procedure, oophorectomy, in the pediatric population. Five patients under-went laparoscopic oophorectomy during the past year. The indication for oophorectomy in three cases was ovarian torsion---one in association with a hemorrhagic cyst another with a benign teratoma, and one that occurred prenatally. The fourth patient had a teratoma with significant solid component and the final patient was a young with Turner's syndrome who had laparoscopic exploration and removal of bilateral streak ovaries. Oophorectomy was successfully completed laparoscopically in each patient. In two cases a trocar site had to be widened to remove the specimen from the abdominal cavity. Post operative recovery was prompt, with time to discharge being an average of 2 days. From this experience we conclude that laparoscopic oophorectomy can be successfully accomplished in infants and children. It is technically an easy procedure and has the benefits of excellent visualization of the entire lower abdomen and pelvis including the contralateral ovary, rapid postoperative recovery, and good cosmetic result."
CD009786,0,18179147,0,Surgical approach to appendiceal mucocele mimicking an adnexal complex mass: case report.,"Mucocele of the vermiform appendix is a rare disease of the appendix caused by mucoid substance retention in its lumen, due to obstruction or hyperproduction due to appendiceal retention cysts, mucosal hyperplasia, mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas. Therefore, also appendiceal malignancy can be the underlying cause, making accurate preoperative diagnosis imperative, even if this disease is often asymptomatic and an early diagnosis still remains very difficult on imaging studies. In women, appendiceal mucoceles can sometimes present on clinical and instrumental findings as a right adnexal mass mimicking an ovarian neoplasm. A rare case of appendiceal mucocele in a 36-year-old women with a right-sided painful pelvic mass is presented. The mucocele was misdiagnosed as a cystic complex mass of the right adnexa both clinically and ultrasonographically. Serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 were increased. Explorative laparoscopy was performed revealing an enlarged vermiform appendix with the uterus and adnexa macroscopically normal, and no signs of intraperitoneal metastasis or adnexal torsion. Laparotomic appendectomy followed. Histological examination revealed a mucinous cystadenoma of the vermiform appendix. This clinical entity of appendiceal mucocele should always be considered by gynaecologists as well as gastroenterologists in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting a right-sided adnexal mass on ultrasound in order to choose the best surgical approach."

CD009786,0,2288664,0,Gynecologic applications of MRI.,"Gynecologic anatomy is consistently depicted with MRI. Abnormal developmental anatomy is also well assessed. In cases of complete or partial vaginal agenesis where ultrasound is equivocal, MRI can be definitive. The various subtypes of uterine anomalies are well delineated with MRI. MRI is the optimal technique in the therapeutic evaluation of leiomyomas, because the number, size, location, and degeneration can be documented. It is particularly useful in the identification of the ovaries in the presence of an enlarged leiomyomatous uterus. Adenomyosis, an often neglected diagnosis, is distinguishable from leiomyomas. In the setting of an equivocal ultrasound, MRI is useful in discerning whether a mass is ovarian or uterine in origin. Endometriosis, a disease routinely diagnosed and staged by laparoscopy, does have a typical MR appearance and therefore can usually be differentiated from other adnexal masses. Dermoids are readily diagnosed with MRI. Other adnexal masses do not have a specific MR appearance and morphologic criteria as used with ultrasound or CT must be relied upon in suggesting whether or not the mass is benign or malignant. MRI is the procedure of choice in the staging of cervical and endometrial cancer."

We studied 136 consecutive cyst fluids (108 benign, 28 malignant) and correlated the findings with the tissue diagnosis. All three antigens were very low (CEA, less than 0.5 ng/ml; CA125, 55-2,143 mu/ml; and AFP, less than 4.8 ng/ml) in follicular and lutein cysts. Markedly elevated CA125 (296-1,950,000 mu/ml) and low CEA (0.5-220 ng/ml) and AFP (less than 4.8 ng/ml) levels were seen in patients with serous neoplasms, both benign and malignant. Elevated CEA (greater than 600 ng/ml) and CA125 (56-65,330 mu/ml) levels were seen in primary mucinous cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma. Two patients with colonic carcinoma metastatic to the ovary had an elevated CEA (greater than 600 ng/ml) and a normal CA125. Only one patient, with a malignant teratoma, had an elevated AFP. The adjunctive use of CEA and CA125 is recommended for the classification of ovarian cysts."
CD009786,0,3493176,0,Interleukin-1: a possible role in the infertility associated with endometriosis.,"Increased numbers of activated macrophages are associated with mild endometriosis. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a protein produced by macrophages and is believed to be a primary mediator of host responses. IL-1 induces prostaglandin and fibrinogen synthesis and stimulates fibroblast proliferation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of IL-1 in the infertility associated with mild endometriosis. Peritoneal fluid (PF) was obtained at laparoscopy from 11 patients with minimal or mild endometriosis and from 7 women undergoing tubal ligation. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured for 24 hours. Peritoneal and macrophage culture fluids were studied for IL-1 activity, which was measured with the EL-4 assay. IL-1 activity was present in the PF of 10 of the 11 patients with endometriosis and 11 of the 11 macrophage culture fluids and was absent in the PF and macrophage culture fluid of the tubal ligation patients. The effect of recombinant alpha-IL-1 on the in vitro growth of 2-cell mouse embryos was also studied. IL-1 in concentrations similar to those present in the PF (greater than 1 U/ml) was toxic to mouse embryo development. We conclude that the IL-1 may play a role in the infertility associated with endometriosis."

CD009786,0,11140864,0,Laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy.,"In the last decade, operative laparoscopic procedures are performed increasingly in both gynecology and general surgery. The major advantages of this newer minimally invasive approach are: decreased postoperative morbidity, less pain and decreased need for analgesics, early normal bowel function, shorter hospital stay, and early return to normal activity. With the advancement of laparoscopic surgery, its use during pregnancy is becoming more widely accepted. The most commonly reported laparoscopic operation during pregnancy is laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Other laparoscopic procedures commonly performed during pregnancy include: management of adnexal mass, ovarian torsion, ovarian cystectomy, appendectomy, and ectopic pregnancy. The possible drawbacks of laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy may include injury of the pregnant uterus and the technical difficulty of laparoscopic surgery due to the growing mass of the gravid uterus. Also, the potential risk of decreased uterine blood flow secondary to the increase in intraabdominal pressure and the possible risk of carbon dioxide absorption to both the mother and fetus should be taken into account. To date, data on laparoscopic surgery during pregnancy are insufficient to draw conclusions on its safety and exact complication rate. This is due to the few cases reported and the lack of prospective studies. Furthermore, there is a common tendency to underreport unsuccessful cases. Finally, most reports in the literature come from centers and surgeons with special interest, experience, and skills in laparoscopy, and their results may not reflect the real complication rates. We have reviewed the pertinent English literature from the last decade. The cumulative experience suggests that laparoscopic surgery may be performed safely during pregnancy, although more studies are needed to establish its exact rate of adverse events."

First, the results of these 254 cycles were compared with 174 cycles involving patients with proven non-endometriotic tubal infertility having similar age and body mass index. Women with ovarian endometriosis had a significantly higher cancellation rate, but similar pregnancy, implantation and delivery rates as patients with tubal infertility. Second, among the women with ovarian endometriosis, the women with a history of laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometriomas prior to IVF and no visual endometriosis at ovum pick-up (n = 112) were compared with the non-operated women and visual endometriomas at ovum pick-up (n = 142). Patients who underwent ovarian surgery before IVF had significantly shorter period, lower antral follicle count and required higher gonadotropin doses than patients with non-operated endometriomas. The two groups of women with a previous or present ovarian endometriosis did, however, have similar pregnancy, implantation and live birth rates. In conclusion, ovarian endometriosis does not reduce IVF outcome compared with tubal factor. Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins."

The procedure can be done by open surgery (laparotomy) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) technique. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery include shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activity, and reduced postoperative pain. However, conventional laparoscopic surgery techniques required the infusion of gas carbon dioxide in the peritoneum to distend the abdomen and displace the bowel upward to create the room for surgical manipulation. Serious complications such as abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the circulating blood (hypercarbia) and perforation of internal organs have also been reported. These serious complication may be harmful to the fetus."

One hundred and seventy-three patients with stage III or IV ovarian carcinoma underwent diagnostic open laparoscopy. Seventy-one patients underwent complete excision of port sites at the time of debulking surgery. Thirty (17%) patients developed port-site metastases. However, only 8 (5%) of these port-site metastases were clinically diagnosed, while 22 out of 71 (31%) with complete port-site excision were diagnosed on pathologic examination. There was no significant relationship between the development of port-site metastases and median time to primary chemotherapy or surgery, the presence of ascites, or stage IV disease. All port-site metastases disappeared during primary therapy, and none of the patients developed a second relapse in one of their port sites. We observed a high rate of port-site metastases after laparoscopy in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma. However, prognosis was not worse in this group of patients. Laparoscopy is a convenient technique to diagnose advanced ovarian carcinoma, to exclude other primary tumors, and to refer patients to a tertiary center."

CD009786,0,2501110,0,Administration of nasal Buserelin as compared with subcutaneous Buserelin implant for endometriosis.,"One hundred infertile patients with laparoscopically confirmed ovarian endometriosis were treated with either intranasal (IN) Buserelin (Hoechst, AG, Frankfurt am Main, West Germany) (300 micrograms three times a day) or subcutaneous (SC) Buserelin implant (6.6 mg Buserelin). Serum estradiol was suppressed in the menopausal range in both groups, but the inhibition of the pituitary ovarian axis appeared more profound and consistent in the SC group than in the IN group. Laparoscopic findings proved that the SC Buserelin emerged superior to the IN Buserelin. Indeed, the score of endometriotic lesions and the ovarian cyst diameter were more reduced in the SC group than in the IN group. Moreover, the histologic study showed a lower incidence of active endometriosis and a lower mitotic index of ovarian endometrial epithelium in the SC group than in the IN group. In conclusion, the release of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist by a biodegradable implant achieved better efficacy in reducing endometriotic lesions than the IN mode of administration."

Preoperatively, 60-MBq technetium-labeled nannocolloid was injected in the mucosa at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock just adjacent to the tumor recurrence. Three sentinel nodes were detected, respectively, in the left obturator fossa (two) and the right external iliac region, using a laparoscopic probe (Navigator) and removed for pathological assessment. As they proved to be negative, the patient underwent a total vaginectomy, parametrectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. The tumor was completely removed, and all lymph nodes proved to be negative. The accuracy of sentinel node identification in patients with recurrent gynecological tumors needs further evaluation. This unique case shows that sentinel node detection is possible after previous radiotherapy and surgery and hopes to stimulate further research in this field."
CD009786,0,15304167,0,Mucinous adenocarcinoma in an ovarian remnant.,"The ovarian remnant syndrome, a complication of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, is progressively receiving more attention in the gynecological surgery literature. The syndrome is manifested by pelvic pain and a palpable or sonographic finding of a pelvic mass. However, in rare cases, patients can present with large masses and radiographic suggestion of malignancy. We present the case of a 76-year-old white female, 23 months after bilateral salpino-oophorectomy at the same institution, complaining of 3.5 months of right flank and abdominal pain. Clinical and radiological evidence of a right ovarian remnant was discovered. Subsequent laparoscopic resection was consistent with a well-encapsulated mucinous adenocarcinoma in a right ovarian remnant. Curiously, this patient had no history of endometriosis, dense pelvic adhesions, pelvic inflammatory disease, or difficulty encountered during the original hysterectomy. This is the seventh published case report in the international literature about carcinoma developing in an ovarian remnant. However, this case differs in that the patient had no preexisting gynecologic conditions at the time of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to account for residual ovarian tissue. Additionally, the oophorectomy was performed vaginally, in contrast to multiple previous case reports."

Second-look surgery was carried out in the following situations: (1) tumor elements found in the washings of the peritoneum in Douglas' space and high blood-serum levels of CA-125 (8 patients with stage I-II tumors, in clinical remission); (2) during remission, after 6-10 courses of polychemotherapy (13 patients with stage III-IV tumors); (3) during remission, after non-radical primary surgery (117); (4) suspected recurrence (144); (5) recurrence-free surgical pathology, e.g. ventral hernia, requiring laparotomy (22). Patients without repeated laparotomy (199) were in control. During remission, surveillance can be carried out using cytologic, ultrasound and immunoradiologic techniques since laparoscopy fails. The latter is useful, for diagnostic purposes, in case of discrepancy between clinical and ultrasound evidence as well as during monitoring in patients in clinical remission who show unfavorable levels of CA-125 and poor results of sonographic. Laparotomy is indicated prior to chemotherapy of inoperable tumors for morphologic verification of diagnosis. Indications for second-look operations can be significantly decreased considering the latest improvements in non-invasive monitoring technique. Laparoscopic examination can effectively serve the same purposes."

This new modality preserves both the technical benefits of traditional manual assistance and the convalescent advantages of minimally invasive surgery. Our preliminary experience suggests that this approach is a feasible, safe, and expeditious access option that can effectively replace an extended open laparotomy incision or an excessively tedious laparoscopic exercise in the evaluation and management of pelvic malignancy. Moreover, oncologic surgeons, reluctant to relinquish the tactile advantages of open surgery, may find hand-assisted laparoscopy an appealing alternative."

In this retrospective study, ovarian cysts over 30 mm in diameter were detected in 90 women. Of this population, 75 were premenopausal, 13 postmenopausal, and two had undergone a hysterectomy. Thirteen women presented acutely. Family history of breast, ovary or colon cancer was not ascertained in any of the women. None had CA125 levels performed. In 22 cases, the cyst was aspirated; only 10 of these had follow-up ultrasound. Laparotomy was performed in 25 premenopausal women, the two perimenopausal women and eight postmenopausal women. Average cyst size was 71 mm (range 40-80 mm) in the laparoscopy group, and 72 mm (range 36-180 mm) in the laparotomy group. After initial diagnosis at ultrasound, a follow-up scan was performed 4-16 weeks later. The final diagnosis was ovarian neoplasm in 13 and hydrosalpinx in two. None had a malignancy. Documentation at ultrasound was often inadequate, and management of the women with an ovarian cyst was haphazard.

CD009786,0,23024155,0,"Diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of borderline ovarian tumors.","Borderline ovarian tumors represent a heterogeneous group of noninvasive tumors of uncertain malignant potential with characteristic histology. They occur in younger women, are present at an early stage, and have a favorable prognosis, but symptomatic recurrence and death may be found as long as 20 years after therapy in some patients. The molecular changes in borderline ovarian tumors indicate linkage of this disease to type I ovarian tumors (low-grade ovarian carcinomas). The pathological stage of disease and subclassification of extraovarian disease into invasive and noninvasive implants, together with the presence of postoperative macroscopic residual disease, appear to be the major predictor of recurrence and survival. However, it should be emphasized that the most important negative prognostic factor for recurrence is just the use of conservative surgery, but without any impact on patient survival because most recurrent diseases are of the borderline type-easily curable and with an excellent prognosis. Borderline tumors are difficult masses to correctly preoperatively diagnose using imaging methods because their macroscopic features may overlap with invasive and benign ovarian tumors. Over the past several decades, surgical therapy has shifted from a radical approach to more conservative treatment; however, oncologic safety must always be balanced. Follow-up is essential using routine ultrasound imaging, with special attention paid to the remaining ovary in conservatively treated patients. Current literature on this topic leads to a number of controversies that will be discussed thoroughly in this article, with the aim to provide recommendations for the clinical management of these patients."

A retrospective review from 1980 to 1989 showed 29 ovarian cysts in 27 patients diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography performed between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Nineteen cysts were initially observed. Eleven cysts resolved (diameter less than 2 cm), three are decreasing, three were lost to follow-up, and two underwent resection. Eight patients underwent surgical exploration immediately following birth. The diagnosis of benign ovarian cyst was confirmed histologically in all cases. A review of the literature showed an additional 230 cases of antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts. Simple cysts of the ovary tend to resolve spontaneously and, therefore, may be treated conservatively. Serial ultrasonography allows accurate diagnosis and long-term assessment of ovarian cysts in the neonate and may prevent unnecessary oophorectomy. Patients with cysts larger than 4 cm may be candidates for percutaneous aspiration, or should undergo removal of the cyst because of a significant risk of torsion. Complex cystic masses, symptomatic ovarian cysts, and cysts that do not resolve should be removed."

The patients were placed in the lithotomy position after sedation and a veres needle was inserted in the posterior vaginal vault. A trocar followed and warm normal saline was injected into the pelvis. The needle was removed and a telescope connected to a light source and monitor was introduced. Excellent visualization was achieved in all cases examined and the average time of TVL was 30 min. All patients except one found TVL a simple and painless procedure. TVL helped in the diagnosis of six benign ovarian lesions and ruled out OC in the other 17 cases. TVL is an easy method to learn with reliable results. TVL can reduce the number of unnecessary laparoscopies and/or laparotomies and it seems to be useful in ruling out OC.

CD009786,0,19204659,0,[The role of laparoscopy in ovarian carcinoma].,"The role of minimally invasive surgery in the management of gynecologic cancers is continuously expanding. Although few trials have focused on the safety of laparoscopy in oncology, laparoscopy is now widely used for most gynecological malignancies. Laparoscopy is widely used to manage benign ovarian masses, but its role in managing ovarian cancer still needs to be defined. The role of laparoscopy in ovarian cancer surgery may be divided into three following categories: 1) laparoscopic staging of apparent early ovarian cancer; 2) laparoscopic assessment of disease extent and potential for resectability; 3) laparoscopic reassessment, or second-look operation, or rule out recurrence. Laparoscopic approach has shown several advantages like a reduction in operating time, blood loss, hospital stay, and total hospital charges. The limitations of laparoscopic practice include inadequate port-site metastasis, tumour dissemination due to cyst rupture and incomplete staging. In addition, there were limitations in performing extensive laparoscopic sampling of areas of tumor persistence including retroperitoneal lymph nodes. In literature there are no randomized studies assessing the use of laparoscopy in the management of ovarian cancer. Moreover, most of the studies in literature comparing laparoscopy and laparotomy are carried out by surgeons specialized in one of two approaches, so that the results can not be compared."

Ovarian cancer on the other hand, although rare in this age group, is the most common genital tract malignancy. The purpose of this study was to define imaging characteristics of ovarian masses in adolescents between 12 and 21 years old and correlate imaging and surgical findings. Thirty-seven female adolescent patients aged between 12 and 21 years were operated on because of a diagnosed ovarian mass between 1997 and 2002. All patients underwent pelvic ultrasound, five had an abdominal CT scan, two had abdominal MRI, one abdominal X-ray and one intravenous pyelography. Ultrasound was used to define the size of the lesion and to characterize its gross morphologic condition as solid, simple cyst or complex cyst. The records were reviewed for age at presentation, presenting symptoms, diagnostic studies, surgical procedure and pathology findings, which were available for all patients. In our study 32 patients (86.5%) were symptomatic and five asymptomatic (13.5%). The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (59.5%). Thirty-four patients (91.1%) had benign lesions, two had malignant tumors (5.4%) and one patient had a borderline lesion (2.7%). The most common ovarian masses detected were germ cell tumors (27.5%) and functional cysts (25%). Twenty patients (54%) underwent operative laparoscopy and 17 patients (46%) exploratory laparotomy.

From 1985 to 1994, the author carried out 920 laparoscopic operations for the removal of ovarian cysts. Of these, 13 were converted to laparotomies, mostly because of peri-adnexal adhesions. There were 22 recurrences (endometriosic and mucinous multilocular cysts), and five severe complications (two purulent inflammations, one intra-operative haemorrhage and one post-operative one, one post-operative acute abdomen sine causa). In one case, an unrecognised endometrioid carcinoma was inadequately treated with laparoscopy. The author considers laparoscopy as the elective choice for surgical treatment of ovarian cysts. Suspect malignancy is not a contra-indication to laparoscopic surgery, since the removal of the operative specimen and its subsequent histological examination can be effected-in the large majority of cases-with the same results both laparoscopically and laparotomically.

CD009786,0,12886864,0,Prophylactic surgery in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome.,"The hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome is responsible for approximately 5% of all breast cancers and 10% of all ovarian cancers. Although this accounts for a small portion of these diseases, much attention has been focused on this syndrome because of the abundance of research in this area. The majority of the hereditary breast/ovarian syndrome can be attributed to germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Reliable screening techniques for these mutations have been developed and are readily available in clinical practice. For patients who are thought to have the hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome based on family history or genetic testing, options exist for either intensive screening or prophylactic surgery. This review will discuss the mechanisms by which mutations in the BRCA genes lead to the development of cancer, the limitations of currently available screening techniques, and the efficacy of prophylactic surgery. In general, prophylactic oophorectomy can be performed laparoscopically as an outpatient procedure, carrying as its main drawback the associated consequence of surgical menopause. Prophylactic mastectomy is quite effective in reducing the risk of breast cancer but is a more extensive surgical procedure and results in disfigurement. For any given patient, the best estimates of individual risk of breast or ovarian cancer should be weighed against the benefits of prophylactic surgery and the patient's personal wishes."

As one-third of borderline ovarian tumours are diagnosed in women under the age of 40 years, fertility-sparing treatment has been more frequently used in the past 10 years. Fertility drugs are well tolerated in women with infertility after fertility-sparing surgery. Careful selection of candidates is necessary. Laparoscopic techniques can be used, but should be reserved for oncologic surgeons. This conservative treatment increases the rate of recurrence, albeit with no effect on survival. The pregnancy rate is nearly 50%, and most are achieved spontaneously. These women should be closely followed up. The question is whether this is acceptable from a gynaecologic oncologic point of view. For this reason, we will discuss recently published studies and gynaecologic oncologic concerns about the mode of fertility-sparing surgery and its consequences."

Forty-three patients underwent surgical treatment for ovarian tumors, from November 1992 to October 1993. Of the 43 patients with ovarian tumors, 19 (44%) underwent laparoscopic surgery, and 24 (56%) underwent laparotomy. Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 18 of 34 (53%) patients with benign ovarian cysts. Eight patients with malignant ovarian tumors were treated by laparotomy. Coincidence of preoperative assessment and surgical diagnosis was 95%. No major complications were observed in the laparoscopic surgery. We suggest that malignant ovarian tumors and inextricable adhesions are contraindications to laparoscopic surgery. We propose the following criteria for laparoscopic surgery by classification into three groups: A) good indication: benign cystic tumors with good mobility, B) deliberation indication: benign tumors with poor mobility, including some dermoid cysts and endometrial cysts, C) contraindication: malignant tumors and dense adhesions. We conclude that indications of laparoscopic surgery for ovarian tumors should be determined by careful preoperative assessment using transvaginal ultrasonography and tumor markers."

There are several typical ovarian sonographic signs which are known to occur frequently in women with benign ovarian cystic teratomas. High-resolution sonography can identify the cysts based on their typical sonographic signs.

Exact work-up of the cone is the basis for successful treatment. A great variety exists in regard to radicality of surgery in patients with cervical cancer--ranging between modified radical hysterectomy and radical hysterectomy with resection of the parametria to both pelvic side walls. Assessment of lymph node status is mandatory for individual treatment. Pelvic lymphonodectomy represents standard treatment at radical hysterectomy, and if positive, paraaortic lymphonodectomy is indicated. Micturition disorders, urinary incontinence, lymph cysts, bowel problems, thrombophlebitis, urogenital fistulas, and pulmonary embolism are the most frequent complications following radical hysterectomy. Today, there is an increasing competition between different therapy strategies in cervical cancer such as primary irradiation, chemoradiation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, laparoscopic radical hysterectomy, vaginal radical hysterectomy combined with laparoscopic surgical staging. All these treatment modalities have to be compared with the ""golden standard"" comprising survival and recurrence rates functional results, morbidity, mortality and quality of life."
CD009786,0,4276392,0,Laparoscopy.,"In the last five years, laparoscopy has become increasingly popular in North America. The procedure has been mainly embraced by the gynecologist and its use in this field has largely supplanted culdoscopy. Other specialties, nevertheless, have been slower in recognizing its value.The procedure has wide applications in gynecology. In pediatrics, laparoscopy proves useful in elucidation of amenorrhea, intersex and precocious puberty. In general surgery, laparoscopy has been recognized as a useful tool in the patient with multiple trauma, and in establishing the diagnosis of many intra-abdominal conditions.Numerous perlaparoscopic operative procedures which include biopsies and tubal sterilizations may be carried out by an experienced operator. Complications associated with the procedure are few, but may be severe. These can be avoided by careful adherence to proper technique."
CD009786,0,3945444,0,Endometriosis: pathogenetic implications of the anatomic distribution.,"The authors have reassessed the anatomic distribution of ectopic endometrium by the laparoscopic study of the location of implants, adhesions, and uterine position in 182 consecutive patients with infertility and endometriosis. The ovary was the most common site of implants with 54.9% having either unilateral or bilateral involvement. This was followed, in order of frequency, by the posterior broad ligament (35.2%), the anterior cul-de-sac (34.6%), the posterior cul-de-sac (34.0%), and the uterosacral ligament (28.0%). Adhesion formation followed the same anatomic distribution. No patients were noted to have endometriosis of the cervix and vagina. Endometriosis of the anterior compartment (anterior cul-de-sac, anterior broad ligament, and anterior uterine serosa) was significantly more common in patients with anterior uteri (40.7%) versus patients with posterior uteri (11.8%, P less than .0005). Exclusive anterior compartment disease was found only in patients with anterior uteri, and significantly more commonly in patients with severely anteflexed uteri (P less than .005). These data suggest that factors influencing implantation of retrograde menstrual debris include: the dependent pooling of peritoneal fluid as affected by uterine position; epithelial cell type at the site of implantation; unique ovarian susceptibility; route of entry; and mobility of the pelvic structures. The data support the Sampson hypothesis of retrograde menstruation as the primary model of development of endometriosis."
CD009786,0,14968063,0,[Surgical treatment for endometriomas].,"Endovaginal ultrasonography is relevant for the diagnosis of ovarian endometriomas with a good predictive value. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be recommended if deep endometriosis is suspected. Operative laparoscopic management is the 'gold standard' for surgical treatment, and medical treatment should not be given before surgery. Peritoneal lavage cytology must be performed before cystectomy. First, the cyst is opened and the endometriosic fluid is aspirated. The stripping technique is performed and after hemostasis, the ovarian cortex is reattached with microsurgical sutures. Coagulation or laser vaporization of endometriomas without excision of the pseudocapsule seems to be associated with a significant increase in risk of cyst recurrence. Recurrent ovarian surgery is not recommended in women with infertility, as it might be deleterious for ovarian reserve."

The extent of disease was assessed by clinical and conventional radiologic examinations, peritoneoscopy with visualization of diaphragmatic leaves, peritoneal cytology, and, in some patients, exploratory laparotomy. The highest incidence of metastases was found in advanced stages (31.1% in stage III and 60% in stage IV) and in recurrences (75.9%). In 87 patients with early disease, the incidence was 9.2%. In 36 pretreated patients with no evidence of disease, this incidence was 11.1%. Biopsies of the nodes were performed in 96 patients: radiologic accuracy was confirmed in 33 of 33 positive and in 55 of 63 negative cases. Of the patients, 33% had metastases only in the pelvic nodes, and 7.9% only in the paraaortic nodes; in 79.1%, both chains were involved simultaneously. These data confirm the importance of lymphography in diagnosis, treatment planning, and surveillance of ovarian carcinoma."
CD009786,0,7736636,0,The role of endovaginal ultrasound in differentiating endometriomas from other ovarian cysts.,"Endometriomas have a prevalence of 24% among all ovarian cysts. Various sonographic features have been proposed to identify endometriomas. Although the visualization of ovarian masses with low-level internal echoes is suggestive for the endometriotic origin of the cyst, no data are yet available on the specificity of endovaginal ultrasonography in differentiating endometriomas from other ovarian masses. To address this issue, the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of endovaginal ultrasonography in comparison with pathology were calculated for each visualized cyst. The study population (n = 251) consisted of all premenopausal non pregnant women submitted to laparotomy or laparoscopy between May 1991 and March 1993 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Cagliari. Within one week before surgery, all patients underwent endovaginal ultrasonography and 93 ovarian cysts were visualized. After the scan, the physician gave prospective impressions as to the presence of endometriomas using the visualization of round-shaped homogeneous hypoechoic ""tissue"" of low-level echoes within the ovary as characteristic ultrasonographic finding. Ultrasonographic impression was compared with histopathological diagnosis. Out of 93 adnexal masses detected by ultrasound, 31 were suspected to be endometriomas and the diagnosis was confirmed in 24. The sensitivity and the specificity of endovaginal ultrasonography in differentiating endometriomas from other ovarian cysts were 83% and 89%, respectively. This specificity (89%) is comparable with that obtainable with magnetic resonance imaging (91%)."

Typical karyotype is 45,X0; however, 6% of TS have mosaic patterns including Y chromosome or fragments of Y. This karyotype is a risk factor of developing a dysgerminoma in dysgenic gonads. Furthermore, rare cases of polycystic ovary are described in young-adult patients with TS. We describe the clinical case of a 12-year-old girl with TS treated with GH who showed a good response to treatment. She developed an ovary with histological polycystic pattern and a contralateral gonadoblastoma in the streak gonad. Laparoscopic gonadectomy was performed, with a good prognosis.

Primary bladder dermoid is very rare problem. It could be managed endoscopically when it is limited to detrusor muscle. Secondary dermoid in the urinary bladder is not uncommon among the female specially during their reproductive life. It is mostly ovarian origin. Ovarian dermoid may grow and invade the urinary bladder wall to discharge its content in the urine. Cystoscopic evaluation followed by laparotomy and excision of ovarian dermoid along its extension to the urinary bladder is a rational approach. However if expertise is available it may be managed laparoscopically. Our patient has benign indolent coarse of pilimiction for last 9 years. Except US scans we did not do MRI or CT scan for financial constrain. Keeping an open mind we did cyst evaluation. Attempt of endoscopic resection seems that the dermoid has invaded bladder wall from out side. We did laparotomy in the same sitting. Lt. ovary was almost buried between the leaf of broad ligament and contain a dermoid cyst invading bladder wall to discharge its contents. So we confirm our diagnosis as secondary bladder dermoids as a cause of pilimiction & excise the whole specimen keeping its safety margin.

All patients with theca lutein cysts had significantly elevated serum 17-OHP levels compared to those in 1) normal pregnancy, 2) patients with GTN and normal-size ovaries, 3) patients with metastatic GTN in the absence of ovaries (P less than 0.02). Levels of serum 17-OHP but not P correlated with the degree of ovarian enlargement (r = 0.87, P less than 0.05). Serum P concentrations in patients with theca lutein cysts, although higher than the levels in cases of GTN with normal-size ovaries, were not significantly different from the levels in normal pregnancy (P greater than 0.05). Serum hCG levels in patients with theca lutein cysts, though higher than the normal pregnancy levels (P less than 0.05), were not significantly different from those in cases of GTN with normal-size ovaries and GTN without ovaries (P greater than 0.05). Under the conditions studied, no correlation was observed between serum hCG and P levels in our cases of GTN. Increased serum 17-OHP level in a patient with GTN suggests the presence of theca lutein cysts."

On the basis of their experience the authors address the clinical classification of benign ovarian pathology and the surgical laparoscopic procedures utilised in the treatment of adnexal cysts. Forty-two patients underwent laparoscopic surgery after a preoperative clinical and biological evaluation and imaging in order to exclude the presence of ovarian malignancies. All surgical procedures were carried out laparoscopically, with a conversion index of 0%. The morbidity was 2.3% (one case of haematoma of the umbilical trocar site) and there was no mortality. No late complications were observed. In conclusion, laparoscopic surgery in the management of ovarian cysts is technically feasible. On the basis of these findings laparoscopic surgery is the treatment of choice for adnexal cystic tumours after careful exclusion of malignancy."

Many of these procedures have been heralded as avant garde 'surgical standards' without appropriate evaluation of efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency. Larger series of patients have now replaced case reports to try to answer the numerous unanswered questions regarding the value of these procedures. Several prospective trials were begun to compare laparotomy and laparoscopy.

Of 20 oviducts removed after documented sterilization failure (group I), 6 revealed a process compatible with endometriosis. Four of nine previously ligated fallopian tubes removed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (group II) were successfully injected with India ink. In two patients histologic examination demonstrated the India ink in epithelium-lined spaces that lay beyond the muscle of the tubal wall extending from the tubal lumen to the serosal surface. Fifty oviducts were studied in twenty-five patients requesting reversal of their sterilizations (group III). A higher percentage of fistulas was demonstrated in patients with less than 4 cm of remaining proximal tubal segment. Furthermore, most of these fistulas were demonstrated in patients for whom 3 years had elapsed since the original sterilization procedure. Patients sterilzed by laparoscopic cautery methods were observed to have a higher percentage of fistula formation and histologic documentation of endometriosis at the sterilization site as compared with patients sterilized by other methods. Our observations suggest that ligation of the oviduct within 4 cm of the uterine cornu may predispose to the development of endometriosis and subsequent fistula formation in the tip of the ligated oviduct."

This retrospective and noncomparative study was carried out in 65 patients who presented dermoid ovarian cyst between January 1986 and December 1990 in our institution. The surgical treatment was performed purely by laparoscopy in 86.2% of the cases (56 patients). The modalities of laparoscopic surgery were as follows: ovariectomy (8 cases; 14.3%), transparietal cystectomy (4 cases; 7.1%) and intraperitoneal cystectomy (44 cases; 78.6%). In 15 cases (15/44 = 34%) the intraperitoneal cystectomy was carried out without opening the cyst and the intact cyst was extracted using an endoscopic impermeable sack. We observed no cases of chemical peritonitis. The risk of recurrence after conservative treatment is 4% (two patients) and out of the ten patients for whom a second-look laparoscopy was performed only two (20%) presented adhesions. Laparoscopic treatment of dermoid ovarian cysts is feasible, safe, and effective. The treatment can be conservative in over 80% of the cases. The specific risk of chemical peritonitis can be countered by a change in the cystectomy technique. The use of an impermeable laparoscopic sack permits extraction of the cyst without any peritoneal contamination."

The role of minimally invasive surgical techniques continues to expand because they offer reduced intraoperative and postoperative complications, less intraoperative blood loss, and a shorter postoperative recovery. Despite initial concerns about the use of minimally invasive surgery in gynecologic oncology, this approach has been shown to be safe and effective in the management of uterine and cervical cancer, and minimally invasive surgical management of these malignancies is now commonplace. Concerns remain regarding the use of minimally invasive surgery for the staging and management of ovarian cancer, including concerns regarding the adequacy of abdominal exploration and staging with minimally invasive approaches compared to traditional laparotomy and the risks and implications of intra-operative tumor cyst rupture and port-site metastases. However, several case series, retrospective reviews, and case-control studies have demonstrated that minimally invasive surgery is both safe and effective for the staging of borderline ovarian tumors and early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer when performed by a trained gynecologic oncologist. Data to support the role of minimally invasive surgery for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer are scant and use of minimally invasive surgery in this setting is not recommended."

We reviewed our experience with a prospective ongoing protocol for the treatment of benign ovarian teratomas, between January 1990 and December 1996. Sonography established the diagnosis, and biochemical markers were used to screen for possible malignancy. Surgery consisted of resecting the cyst and conserving the ovary if appropriate. The resected cyst was aspirated of its contents following insertion into an EndoCatch bag. Removal was accomplished via the narrowest incision possible by pulling the bag's margins through the incision and grasping the solid parts with conventional surgical instruments. The diameter of the cysts ranged from 2 to 15 cm. Cystectomy was performed in 47, and oophorectomy in 37, patients. Spillage occurred in 11 cases, but none developed peritonitis or fever. The mean duration of post-operative stay was 0.9 days (range 0.5-2). We conclude that laparoscopic resection of benign teratomas of the ovary is safe, well tolerated, and shortens hospital stay."

Endosurgical techniques of biopsy and excision were used for diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors, respectively. Since July 1997, a total of 24 biopsies and 24 excisions have been performed laparoscopically for neuroblastoma ( n=24), ovarian solid tumors ( n=10) and other tumors. Seventeen biopsies and six excisions were performed for abdominal neuroblastoma, while ten excisions were performed for ovarian tumor. In these patients, the length of the operation, blood loss, time to start postoperative feeding, time to start postoperative chemotherapy and length of hospital stay were evaluated and compared to the those of the open surgery group. Furthermore, intra- and postoperative complications were analyzed in all patients of both groups. The length of the hospital stay and time to start postoperative feeding were significantly shorter in the group of patients who underwent endosurgical procedures for either abdominal neuroblastoma or ovarian tumor when compared to the open procedure group. The time to start postoperative chemotherapy was shorter only in the abdominal neuroblastoma group. The procedure for two patients undergoing endosurgical tumor excision had to be converted to open surgery due to large tumor size. Two weeks after thoracoscopic excision of a dumb bell-type neurofibroma, one patient underwent open repair of the dura mater because of leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. There were no port-site recurrences in any tumor types. Endosurgical procedures for solid tumors are effective and minimally invasive. However, better indicators are needed for their implementation in order to prevent complications and subsequent conversions to open procedures."

In cancers of the endometrium, it is part of a surgical strategy associating vaginal hysterectomy. In ovarian cancers, it is essentially applied to restaging of insufficiently explored apparent stage I tumours. In operable cervical cancer, it guides the therapeutic protocol and surgical indication by allowing interiliac lymphadenectomy.

After the operative treatment and pathologic verification from the 100 studied tumors were found 15 (15%) carcinous cystadenoma, 2 (2%) mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, 25 (25%) serous cystadenoma, 10 (10%) serous cystadenocarcinoma, 10 (10%) adenocarcinoma, 23 (23%) teratoma and 13 (13%) tumors of the other kind, 25 (25%) of tumors were malign and 75 (75%) was benign. The predicted value of the ultrasoundly proved malignity was 80% (20 from 25 patients) and for the benign tumors it was 96% (72 from 75 patients). Malignant tumor of ovary is the third most common malignant disease of genital organs of a woman and at the same time the most often cause of death of women suffering from gynecologic malignant diseases. From all kinds of gynecologic malignant tumors 25% are carcinoma of ovaries. It is the cause of death in 47% women with the malignant diseases of genital organs. The bad prognosis of this tumor is mostly caused by the late diagnosis.

CD009786,0,17185953,0,[Management of ovarian cysts].,"Ovarian cysts occur frequently in women of reproductive age. These are usually functional cysts which resolve spontaneously and whose evolution can be followed with ultrasound. Non-functional cysts have diverse histologic origins. The most common are serous and mucinous cystadenomas which arise from the epithelial wall of the ovary, endometriomas which arise in the setting of pelvic endometriosis, and dermoid cysts which arise from the germinal cells of the ovary. Endovaginal ultrasound with Doppler enhancement is the best imaging technique to establish the nature of cysts and to distinguish cysts suspicious for malignancy which require more invasive investigation. Pelvic laparoscopy is the surgical approach of choice for the treatment of non-functional benign ovarian cysts. Conservative treatment to shell out the cyst and preserve functional ovarian tissue should be reserved for women desirous of future pregnancies. The risk of ovarian cancer remains a major preoccupation of the surgeon. Where malignancy is suspected, laparoscopy is contraindicated and a median laparotomy is appropriate for radical extirpative surgery. This article describes the diagnostic techniques which allow a laparoscopic approach to presumably benign cysts and discusses surgical techniques specifically adapted to their different histologic nature of ovarian cysts."
CD009786,0,8816863,0,The current role of laparoscopic surgery in gynecological oncology.,"Transabdominal laparotomy is currently the standard approach to the surgical diagnosis and treatment of gynecological malignancies. Despite the fact that laparoscopy has been widely embraced by our gynecological/infertility colleagues for many years, it has only sporadically been utilized by gynecological oncologists. With the advent of video laparoscopy, novel instrumentation, and new techniques, a reevaluation of the applicability of this procedure is certainly in order. To date, laparoscopy has been employed for the performance of a multitude of intra-abdominal procedures. However, universal applicability may not be feasible or in the best interest of all patients with gynecological malignancies. As instrumentation and techniques evolve, it is possible that procedures currently nonamenable to the laparoscopic approach may become so. However, it is wise to approach these new procedures with healthy skepticism, and within the context of proper scientific study. This article summarizes the status of laparoscopic surgery in gynecological oncology."

The currently available screening modalities are disappointing in detecting highly curable early stage ovarian cancer. Natural history of ovarian cancer is unknown; it appears it can develop quickly from normal looking ovaries. Timely referral of women with non-specific symptoms (such as abdominal bloating, pelvic pain) for an ultrasound scan or blood CA125 assessments may help in the early diagnosis. Patients with Stage IA or IB disease with grade 1 tumors have a cure rate of >90%; this is likely to be compromised by laparoscopic surgery. In selected patients fertility preservation with good obstetric outcome is possible. However, the relapse rate in 'high risk' early stage ovarian cancers is 40-45%; adjuvant chemotherapy is needed. Only 20-25% of those with stage III and IV disease are cured. Despite a high primary response (70%) majority (70-75%) will relapse and all are likely to succumb. Optimal debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy are needed for stages III and IV disease; the outcome is superior if managed by gynecologic oncologists. Where cost of drugs is an important consideration, an alternative is carboplatin (an affordable and equally effective drug). The role of vaccines needs further study. When relapses occur palliation will be the aim in most instances. Oral contraceptives, breast feeding, tubal sterilization and hysterectomy also have a protective effect. Risk-reducing salpingo-oopherectomy has been suggested in women with BRCA mutations."

A 31-year-old woman presented with back pain, and radiographic studies disclosed massive liver enlargement and bilateral ovarian tumors. The second patient, a 38-year-old woman, had an enlarged liver at the time of laparoscopic tubal ligation, and subsequently underwent right hepatic lobectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Three months later a left ovarian tumor was detected and a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy performed. The third patient, a 68-year-old woman, presented with gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss, and had bilateral ovarian tumors and widespread tumor at laparotomy. Two patients died of their disease at 18 months and 4 years 7 months; the third patient is alive with residual tumor at 7 months. The ovarian tumors, which were bilateral and multinodular in two cases and focally cystic in one case, ranged from 4 to 11 cm in maximum dimension, and had yellow-green or yellow sectioned surfaces. On microscopic examination, they were composed of cells with moderate to abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm growing diffusely and in nodules, nests, and trabeculae; cysts or glands were conspicuous in two cases. Bile was present in one tumor. The main differential diagnostic considerations were hepatoid yolk sac tumor and hepatoid carcinoma, primary or metastatic in the ovary. A variety of features, including the age of the patient, unilaterality or bilaterality of the ovarian tumors, distribution of disease, and microscopic features of the neoplasm, including the identification of bile, established the diagnosis. Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma must be included in the differential diagnosis of oxyphil cell tumors of the ovary."

CD009786,0,21082898,0,An easy new approach to the laparoscopic treatment of large adnexal cysts.,"We describe a technique for laparoscopically assisted extracorporeal cystectomy or adnexectomy of large adnexal cysts without spillage of the cyst contents. At open laparoscopy, a suction tube decompressed the adnexal cyst from the 2-cm umbilical incision and the puncture hole was closed by the purse string tie, which was followed by extra-corporeal excision of the cyst. With this method, we prevent cyst spillage in three ways. Firstly, the cyst is aspirated extracorporeally. Secondly, when the cyst is totally collapsed, the puncture point is closed with a 1-o Vicryl purse suture and pulled to the umbilicus. Thirdly, as soon as a part of the mass is delivered from the abdomen, it is lined with moist gauze. This method provides excellent visualization and control of the penetration site during aspiration, and minimizes the chances of the cyst contents leaking into the peritoneal cavity. This method was successfully used with 12 patients, including four cystadenomas, one serous cystadenoma, three dermoid cysts (with one pregnant woman who successfully spontaneously delivered a normal baby at term), two low malignant potential ovarian tumors and one grade I endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The cancer patient has shown no recurrence after a follow-up of three years."

CD009786,0,16575358,0,[Laparoscopy and gynecologic cancer in 2005].,"All the surgical procedures, which may be required to treat a gynecologic cancer, can be performed endoscopically. However prospective randomized studies required to confirm the oncologic efficacy of the technique are still lacking in gynecology, whereas such studies are available in digestive surgery. Animal studies suggested that the risk of tumor dissemination in non traumatized peritoneum is higher after a pneumoperitoneum than after a laparotomy. Experimental studies also emphasized two points: the surgeon and the surgical technique are essential, all the parameters of the pneumoperitoneum may influence the postoperative dissemination. Changing these parameters we may, in the future, be able to create a peritoneal environment adapted to oncologic patients in order to prevent or to decrease the risks of peritoneal dissemination and/or of postoperative tumor growth. Until the results of prospective randomized studies become available, the preoperative selection of the patients and the surgical technique should be very strict. In patients with endometrial cancer, the laparoscopic approach should be reserved to clinical stage I disease, if the vaginal extraction is anticipated to be easy accounting for the volume of the uterus and the local conditions. In cervical cancer, the laparoscopic approach should be reserved to patients with favorable prognostic factors: stage IB of less than 2 cm in diameter. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the surgical diagnosis of adnexal masses. But the puncture should be avoided whenever possible. The surgical treatment of invasive ovarian cancer should be performed by laparotomy whatever the stage. In contrast restaging of an early ovarian cancer initially managed as a benign mass, is a good indication of the laparoscopic approach. The laparoscopic management of low malignant potential tumors should include a complete staging of the peritoneum. Knowledge of the principles of endoscopy and of oncologic surgery is required. Teaching and diffusion of endoscopic oncological techniques are among the major challenges of gynecologic surgery within the next few years."

Recently published clinical, experimental studies and case reports related to this problem are reviewed. Frequency of port-site metastases for gallbladder, colorectal and ovarian cancers seem to differ. Ascites and staging during laparoscopy are probably risk factors for port-site metastases. Clinical presentations of port-site metastases are exposed and experimental studies show that pneumoperitoneum, nature of gas as well as local factors were probably implicated. Hypothetical mechanisms of port-site metastases are discussed; it is likely that the aetiology are multifactorial. Preventive strategies of port-site metastases are proposed. Further research in this area is necessary to understand mechanisms of port-site metastases."

Approximately 6170 patients were admitted to the Gynecology Service at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center from July 1984 to June 1985. During this period, 36 of 432 diagnostic laparoscopies (8.3%) and 503 of 1666 laparotomies (30.2%) were performed to evaluate or treat these women. The final diagnoses in the 249 patients admitted with the impression of leiomyomata were: leiomyomata, 235 (94.4%); benign adnexal masses, seven (2.8%); cancers, four (1.6%); and miscellaneous, three (1.2%). Of the 291 patients evaluated for pelvic mass, the findings were: benign ovarian or tubal cysts, 98 (33.7%); leiomyomata, 42 (14.4%); cancers, 40 (13.7%); benign cystic teratomas, 38 (13.1%); endometriosis, 28 (9.6%); miscellaneous, 23 (7.9%); and pelvic inflammatory disease, 22 (7.6%).

At the time of surgery, peritoneal dissemination and ascites was observed. Histological examination revealed that the resected ovary, peritoneal nodes and floating cells in the ascites were metastatic adenocarcinomas. Later, the primary malignant lesion was found to be a type 4 gastric carcinoma. The carcinoma was judged to be unresectable and treated by combination chemotherapy with TS-1 and CDDP every 6 weeks. After 3 courses of treatments, upper gastrointestinal series and endoscopic examinations were conducted and revealed a marked reduction of the tumor size. No carcinoma cells were detected by endoscopic biopsy. CT-scan showed complete disappearance of metastatic lesions. Staging laparoscopy was performed for evaluation of the effects of chemotherapy, and no adenocarcinoma cells at peritoneal nodes or ascites were found histologically. We performed total-gasterectomy with D1 + alpha lymph node dissection. Histopathologically, resected specimens showed severe fibrosis in most parts of the stomach. Following chemotherapy, the carcinoma was judged to be Grade 2 by histopathological examination."

Frozen sections at laparoscopy initially revealed a borderline papillary serous ovarian tumour. Final histology showed an invasive papillary serous ovarian tumor (grade 1). Subsequent staging laparotomy conducted 13 days later revealed peritoneal implantations thus upgrading the initially thought Stage Ia papillary serous ovarian tumour at laparoscopy to Stage IIc. The patient after laparotomy had an uneventful postoperative course and received six cycles of chemotherapy based on taxol and carboplatin.

CD009786,0,19317273,0,Primary adenocarcinoid tumor of the ovary arising in mature cystic teratoma. A case report.,"Primary carcinoid tumors of the ovary are rare, forming 0.3 % of all carcinoid tumors and less than 0.1 % of ovarian malignancies. We present a case of a 47-year-old woman with abnormal vaginal bleeding and abdominal discomfort. Pelvic ultrasonography revealed a right-sided, 4 cm solid ovarian mass. At laparoscopy, a smooth surfaced, firm and mobile right adnexal mass with solid and cystic portions was detected and the tumor was excised. Pathologic and immunohistochemical examination revealed carcinoid tumor. After the evaluation of gastrointestinal and respiratory systems by imaging and endoscopic studies, no evidence of tumor tissue or metastases were found. Based on this finding, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and appendectomy were performed and pelvic-paraaortic lymph nodes were also removed. All histological findings were similar to the features of mature cystic teratoma and carcinoid tumor. Examination of the resected lymphatic, omental and appendiceal tissue indicated no tumoral invasion. Thus, the diagnosis was primary ovarian carcinoid arising from a mature cystic teratoma. This case, in the setting of a normal appendix and negative workup for an extraovarian origin, is one of a primary ovarian adenocarcinoid tumor. The primary carcinoid tumor should be differentiated from a metastatic carcinoid inside the ovary, which is always bilateral. It is important to be aware of this unusual entity in diagnoses of ovarian tumors, even in the absence of any clinical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome."
CD009786,0,2738321,0,[Hysterosalpingographic aspects of ovarian and peritoneal endometriosis. Case-control study].,"A clustering of radiologic signs is associated with the presence of ovarian and/or peritoneal endometriosis: some indicate fibrosis of utero-sacral ligaments (isthmic dissection of the uterus, fixed retroversion); others are linked to pathology of the tube (ampullar retention of dye after evacuation, sometimes inducing false aspects of hydrosalpinx); the last ones suggesting peritoneal adhesions (incomplete peritoneal diffusion). All these signs have been systematically studied, independently of the diagnosis, on 154 hysterosalpingograms of infertile patients known to have patent tubes at laparoscopy: in 107 out of these cases endometriosis was diagnosed at laparoscopy; the 47 last cases constituted the control group. The results confirm that all the signs described are significantly more frequent in cases of endometriosis, although non-specific for this condition. On the contrary, neither adenomyosis, tubal diverticulosis, nor intramural polyps are significantly linked to external endometriosis. In conclusion, some radiologic signs suggest the presence of peritoneo-ovarian endometriosis. Their detection is possible only on high quality pictures, including a last one taken after 10 to 20 minutes walking, to feature the anomalies of tubal evacuation and peritoneal diffusion. The clustering of these signs allows the clinician to propose an early laparoscopy in the work-up of an infertility case. Furthermore, some of these salpingograms provide evidence of a functional disorder of tubal motility in endometriosis, possibly responsible for the low fertility associated with the disease."
CD009786,0,16455020,0,Transperitoneal laparoscopic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in gynecologic cancers.,"Laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgery, may benefit select patients more than traditional abdominal approaches. The benefits of this procedure include low morbidity, shorter length of hospital stay, less blood loss, no significant increase in complications, and a shorter postoperative recovery period; this allows patients to begin adjuvant therapy more quickly. Laparoscopy has been used in gynecologic oncology since the early 1990s and has continued to grow and develop. Complex gynecologic oncology procedures can be performed with a low rate of complication and a low rate of conversion to laparotomy. The literature supports the fact that laparoscopy can be performed with short-term benefit with no increase in morbidity. Although the data are limited and emerging, the risk of cancer recurrence does not appear to increase because of this minimal access approach. Currently, advanced laparoscopic techniques are used to evaluate and treat cervical, endometrial, and ovarian malignancies. Specifically, transperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy including pelvic and paraaortic nodes is a feasible and efficacious procedure in the management of certain gynecologic malignancies."
CD009786,0,9280737,0,[Treatment of adnexal tumors with laparoscopy].,"This article shows the experience in 61 patients with adnexal tumors studied from June 1988 to June 1994; the origin of the patients in private and semiprivate, to whom we practiced a diagnostic and operative laparoscopy (56/61) at the same time. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined by clinical history (past history, age, symptoms, size, etc.), vaginal ultrasonography scan (ascites, papillas, cyst's content, etc.), laboratory tests (Ca 125 in postmenopausal patients), the macroscopic assessment during the diagnostic laparoscopy, transoperative biopsy (19/61) was made in order to confirm the benign findings seen before laparoscopy; and the results were accordingly on the 61 cases. The cause of consult was infertility in 24/61; 18/61 were primary infertility; 6/61 were secondary infertility. We did 22 cystectomies and 2 oophorectomies; 10 of them became pregnant. 37 from 61 had pain, nine of this group we did an oophorectomy (2 by torsion, 3 had hemorrhagic cysts that were ruptured and 4 were residual ovary), the rest 28 we performed cystectomy with frank improvement of their symptoms. The postoperative diagnosis of the tumors were: luteomas 13/61; functional cysts 17/61, Hemorrhagic cysts 8/61; endometriomas 9/61; serous cystoadenoma 3/61; mucinous cystoadenoma 1/61; ovaric fibroma 1/61; mature cystic teratoma 2/61; residual ovaries 4/61; paraovaric cysts 2/61 and Morgagni's hydatide 1/61.

Laparoscopy is very reliable in a presumptive diagnosis of the nature of an ovarian mass, but in this case shows that the operator has to be very attentive especially when there is a rapid recurrence of cyst formation in the ovary that has been operated on. They discuss the indications for intra-peritoneal laparoscopic ovariectomy in short term recurrences after ovarian cyst removal and in particular when these were mucinous. For most authors the risk of dissemination when an ovarian cyst which has proved to be malignant is punctured, seems to be nil, and unlikely to effect the prognosis. It may be possible that in the future the diagnosis of these cases can be improved when the clinical picture, the ultrasound picture and the laparoscopic picture are added to a new development of intraperitoneal laparoscopic ultrasound which will make it possible to view the contents of the cyst with direct contact."

One hundred patients with endometriosis, as demonstrated by laparoscopy, were entered into the study. The mean length of patient follow-up was 49 months. All patients were treated with 800 mg of danazol per day. The mean duration of danazol therapy was 17.3 weeks. Eighty-nine percent of the patients reported symptomatic improvement, and 94% were improved, as demonstrated by repeat laparoscopy or laparatomy. After completing a course of danazol therapy, 57% of the patients underwent conservative laparotomy for fertility enhancement, pain control, or ovarian masses. Two patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy-bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for advanced disease poorly responsive to danazol therapy. In those patients desiring fertility (56), there were 38 pregnancies in 26 women, for an overall fertility rate of 46%. The overall recurrence rate was 33%, as determined by symptoms and physical findings. Significant side effects from danazol were reported by 85% of the patients. The major side effects were weight gain, edema, decrease in breast size, oily skin, hirsutism, and deepening of the voice. Only one patient discontinued danazol therapy due to side effects. Clinical tissues concerning the use of danazol with or without surgery and the miscarriage rate following danazol therapy are discussed."

This study is a systematic review. We searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and COCHRANE LIBRARY) trials registers and reference lists of published trial reports. Six randomized controlled trials were identified involving 324 patients. Duration of surgery, adverse effects of surgery, pain, length of hospital stay, and economic outcomes were compared. The mean duration of surgery was longer in the laparoscopy group overall (weighted mean difference 11.39, 95% CI 0.57-22.22). The pooled estimate for febrile morbidity decreased for laparoscopy (Peto OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.88). The odds of any adverse effect were decreased after laparoscopic procedures (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.55). The odds of being pain free were significantly greater for the laparoscopy group (Peto OR 7.35, 95% CI 4.3-12.56). Mean length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopy group with reduction of 2.79 days (95% CI -2.95 to -2.62). In economic outcomes, there was a significant reduction of US$1045 (95% CI -1361 to -726.97) in the laparoscopy group. Laparoscopy is associated with a reduction in the following: febrile morbidity, urinary tract infection, postoperative complications, postoperative pain, days in hospital, and total cost. These findings should be interpreted with caution as only a small number of studies were identified including a total of only 324 women."
CD009786,0,9315174,0,Evaluation of adnexal masses using three-dimensional ultrasonographic technology: preliminary report.,"The purpose of the current study was to demonstrate the ability of three-dimensional ultrasonographic technology to enhance the morphologic scoring system and further improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant ovarian masses. We performed conventional two-dimensional and three-dimensional transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography on eight women with adnexal masses. All patients underwent exploratory laparotomy or diagnostic laparoscopy. The three-dimensional ultrasonographic findings were compared with the two-dimensional ultrasonograms, the intraoperative observations, and gross and histopathologic findings. The morphologic scoring system as described by Sassone and coworkers was adopted, with scores of less than 9 suggestive of benign lesions, and this system was applied in both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasonographic examinations. The morphologic scores were subsequently compared. The images were dissected in the XYZ planes, and the areas suggestive of malignancy, as suggested by two-dimensional ultrasonography, were determined to be either negative or positive and confirmatory. In each of the eight adnexal masses, three-dimensional ultrasonography confirmed the preoperative diagnoses. The morphologic scores did not differ between two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasonograms for the benign cysts. In one case of benign solid fibroma, both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional gray scale morphologic scores were falsely positive at greater than 9. In one case of malignant serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma the two-dimensional morphologic score was a 9, where- as the three-dimensional score was 13. This difference in scores can be attributed to the additional views available with three-dimensional volume scanning, which allowed better characterization of the pathologic conditions. In addition, three-dimensional sonographic technology had the added advantage of high-speed image acquisition and recording to decrease the time of scanning to improve patient comfort. Furthermore, three-dimensional ultrasonography allowed the real-time analysis of the acquired image data to be conducted at a later time when the patient is off the examination table. Our preliminary results suggest that three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonographic technology can enhance and facilitate the morphologic evaluation of both benign and malignant adnexal masses."

CD009786,0,6715399,0,Diagnosis and staging of ovarian cancer.,"The diagnostic process in ovarian carcinoma is divided into the pre- and intraoperative procedures, examinations of tumor tissue, and follow-up. For preoperative diagnosis, the probability of a palpable adnexal mass being a malignant tumor should first be ascertained by sonography. This should be followed by an appropriate general examination, a search for tumor outside the abdominal cavity and in the liver parenchyma as well as by determination of markers. Intraoperative diagnosis determines the tumor stage and must be carried out all the more comprehensively when the ovarian carcinoma is more limited. Histologic subtype and degree of differentiation are in direct relation to the tumor stage, whereas the size of the primary tumor is often indirectly proportional to its extent. Besides the morphological analysis, the determination of possible chemoresistance and chemosensitivity, as well as further investigations on fresh tumor tissue are included in the tissue examination. Follow-up after a curative operation consists of gynecologic examination and Douglas lavages if tumor is still present in CT Scans and sonographs. To verify a relapse, laparoscopy can be used, but to ascertain a complete remission, a laparotomy is necessary."

CD009786,0,19346186,0,The roles of laparoscopy in treating ovarian cancer.,"Great advances in technology offer meticulous options of minimally invasive surgery to empower the gynecologists to manage patients of early ovarian cancer. Laparoscopy affords improved visualization of the pelvic peritoneum, diaphragm and the deep pelvic structures, and offers many advantages in the avoidance of long abdominal incision, including shorter hospital stay and a more rapid recovery time. Most studies showed that laparoscopy did not compromise the survival and recurrence prognosis in comparison with open abdominal approach of staging surgery. Contrarily, laparoscopy precludes the advantage of open surgery, such as manual examination of the full extent of the bowel and palpation of lymph nodes. Besides, laparoscopy technically hampers the removal of large ovarian mass, and laparoscopic cancer surgery has a potential risk of trocar site metastasis. As the trend shows that laparoscopy has been playing an important role in treating early ovarian cancer, we could expect laparoscopy to become an attractive surgical option in the future for ovarian cancers."

Masses diagnosed as suspicious at surgery should be treated by immediate laparotomy, since the results of laparoscopic treatment of an ovarian cancer are not known. In young patients, conservative surgery is the main advantage of laparoscopy, and should be achieved in most benign masses. The recent progresses of in vitro fertilization should be taken into account when managing an ovarian tumor in a patient who wishes to become pregnant. Frozen sections are useful, when treating highly suspicious masses, allowing an immediate staging and avoiding the disadvantages of a second surgical procedure. Whenever a malignant tumor has been missed at laparoscopy, restaging is required and should be considered to be an oncologic emergency."

CD009786,0,21968159,0,The use of magnets with single-site umbilical laparoscopic surgery.,"Single-site umbilical incision laparoscopic surgery (SSULS) is increasingly being used to treat a variety of childhood surgical diseases. Existing SSULS approaches have inefficient triangulation and poor ergonomics. In an effort to overcome these shortcomings, magnet-assisted laparoscopy was developed. Specialized magnetic graspers are introduced through a standard 12-mm port and are controlled by a powerful external magnet. This study is a retrospective analysis of all magnet-assisted laparoscopic operations performed at the Fundacion Hospitalaria Private Children's Hospital from September 2009 to January 2011. Outcomes include demographics, diagnosis, operative time, intraoperative complications, and conversion rates. Forty-four magnet-assisted laparoscopic operations were performed. The operations included 23 appendectomies, 8 cholecystectomies, 3 Nissen fundoplications, 2 gastrojejunostomies, 2 splenectomies, 2 ovarian tumor/cyst resections, 1 retroperitoneal lymphangioma resection, 1 left adrenalectomy, 1 total abdominal colectomy and 1 pulmonary wedge resection. The mean operative times for the most commonly performed operations were 61 minutes for appendectomy and 93 minutes for cholecystectomy. The operations were classified as follows: Group I, adjunct to conventional laparoscopy (5 operations); Group II, adjunct to multiple-access umbilical laparoscopy (11 operations); and Group III, true single-port laparoscopy (28 operations). Among Group II/III operations, 6 operations required 1 additional port outside the umbilicus. No operations required more that 1 additional port, and no operations were converted to the open technique. There were no intraoperative complications. Magnet-assisted laparoscopic surgery is safe and effective in children. The use of magnetic graspers improves triangulation and ergonomics while reducing the number and size of abdominal incisions."

CD009786,0,12680799,0,Blood-based screening and light based imaging for the early detection and monitoring of ovarian cancer xenografts.,"We report a novel technology for in vivo early detection, identification, and monitoring of ovarian cancer in live mice leading to better treatment outcome. A genetic dualistic reporter system that uses an adenoviral (Ad) vector to transfer the genetic reporters to the ovarian cancer is described. Infection of the cancer cells leads to expression of one reporter that is detected in blood, namely, secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). A second reporter, namely, enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) is also delivered by the Ad, leading to expression at the site of ovarian cancer. The SEAP gene under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter element is linked to the GFP gene with an IRES element. A diagnostic adenoviral vector (Ad) encoding the SEAP and GFP (Ad5-SEAP-GFP) is produced. Efficacy of newly developed diagnostic vector is tested in cell culture and animal models. SKOV3ip.1 cells are infected with Ad5-SEAP-GFP. Over time the cells are monitored for fluorescence and SEAP is also measured in the growth media supernatant. For animal experiments, SKOV3ip.1 cells are implanted first in nude mice either subcutaneously (SC) or intraperitoneally (IP) separately. After 4-7 days, the Ad5-SEAP-GFP is administered. Control mice do not receive any Ad vector. All mice are imaged with a fluorescent stereomicroscope after 24 h, and blood is collected for SEAP analyses. Increasing green fluorescence is detected in all SKOV3ip.1 cells infected with Ad5-SEAP-GFP, while SEAP levels in growth media increase over monitoring period. Expression of GFP in both SC and IP tumors is detected by 24 h in the live mice. At this time, the SEAP blood levels are more than 2-3 fold greater than blood levels of control group. GFP fluorescence and SEAP levels continue to increase in all mice that are injected with Ad5-SEAP-GFP until termination. Control mice (both SC and IP) do not express GFP or SEAP throughout the experiment. GFP contrast is necessary to differentiate between micro-sized early stage non-palpable ovarian tumor nodules and surrounding normal tissue. While the studies are conducted in mice, it is envisioned that the dual-based approach will eventually be translated into human applications for routine diagnosis and monitoring of ovarian cancer when an ovarian cancer specific promoter will be available. Due to the thickness of the abdominal wall in human laparoscopy or laparotomy will be necessary. This system will provide gynecologic oncologists with a more effective tool for treating patients. The blood-based screening assay provides a quick test to determine the presence of the ovarian cancer at its earliest stage. The location of the ovarian cancer is afforded by the light-based imaging component, which represents a new and improving technology with tremendous advantages of sensitivity and spatial resolution to localize micro-sized tumor nodules. The novelty of the dualistic system is the linkage of blood-based reporter screening as a selection criteria for subsequent light-based imaging procedures. This combination will lead to an accurate and widely applicable method for the early detection and monitoring of ovarian cancer, especially in high-risk women"

Laparoscopic hysterectomy can be taken into consideration at the first stage of endometrial, cervical and ovarian cancer.

A prospective observational study of EOC patients with pelvic/aortic lymph node relapse was conducted between January 1995 and June 2005. After a clinical and laparoscopic staging, secondary cytoreduction, including systematic lymphadenectomy, were performed. The eligibility criteria were as follows: disease-free interval > or =6 months, radiographic finding suggestive of bulky lymph node recurrence, and patients' consent to be treated with chemotherapy. Forty-eight EOC patients with lymph node relapse were recruited. Twenty-nine patients were amenable to cytoreductive surgery. Postoperatively, all patients received adjuvant treatment. The median numbers of resected aortic and pelvic nodes were 15 (2-32) and 17 (8-47), respectively. The median numbers of resected aortic and pelvic positive lymph nodes were 4 (1-18) and 3 (1-17), respectively. The mean size of bulky nodes was 3.3 cm. Four patients (14%) experienced one severe complication. No treatment-related deaths were observed. After a median follow-up of 26 months, among cytoreduced patients, 18 women were alive with no evidence of disease, nine were alive with disease. Among the 11 patients not amenable to surgery, five women were alive with persistent disease, six patients died of disease, at a median follow-up of 18 months. Estimated 5-year overall survival and disease-free interval for operated women were 87% and 31%, respectively. In conclusion, patients with bulky lymph node relapse can benefit from systematic lymphadenectomy in terms of survival. The procedure is feasible with an acceptable morbidity rate."

CD009786,0,1838204,0,[Echographic guided puncture of ovarian cysts. Possibilities and limitations].,"Ultrasound-guided puncture is a simple and easy to perform procedure. It would seem to be a good idea to suggest simple puncture as a first intention in cases of an image of ovarian cyst. In theory, the advantages are obvious: a puncture is performed, the liquid is analyzed and an appropriate treatment is administered. Coelio-surgery could surely be avoided in cases of functional cysts and perhaps in some non-malignant ovarian cysts. In fact, it must be remembered that a cancer of the ovary in its early stages may have the appearance of a banal cyst, and that puncture does not allow pathological examination. Cytological examination is insufficient to totally rule out malignancy or to allow detailed histological diagnosis. There is, therefore, a risk of leaving in place the pocket of a cyst which may be organic and which may recur or even develop. For these reasons, ultrasound-guided puncture can be undertaken only in pre-selected patients and in the context of a specific protocol: 1) The ultrasound image of the cyst must be liquid, anechoic, unilocular (or bilocular with a fin wall), with no vegetation, the serum level of CA 125 must be low; 2) it the puncture liquid is oily, tarry or viscous, a celioscopy must be carried out as soon as possible, only a yellow-colored liquid can justify waiting; 3) the analysis of the cyst fluid is not always determinant, and the cytology findings are conclusive only if positive. A high 17 beta-estradiol level suggests a functional cyst.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Eighty percent of group 2 patients underwent restaging laparoscopy (10) or staging laparotomy (2) prior to radiation. All group 2 patients underwent second look procedures if no evidence of disease. No patient developed intestinal complications secondary to radiation requiring surgery. Eighty-one percent of group 1 patients and to date 40% of group 2 patients developed recurrences. Size of residual disease prior to radiation, histologic grade, and substage (IIA, B, or C) did not correlate with recurrences. Five-year estimated survival was 40 and 50% for groups 1 and 2, respectively. Three thousand rad of wole abdominal radiation plus 2000 rad pelvic boost or 5000 rad pelvic radiation plus melphalan did not appear to improve survival over surgery alone.

No complications were seen. After undergoing this procedure, eight of 20 patients achieved pregnancy and 15 of 16 patients obtained pain relief. Serum CA125 levels were significantly decreased postoperatively. We confirmed that contact irradiation with a cone-shaped sapphire probe provides adequate incision and lysis at lower power levels, and that this method is an effective treatment for ovarian endometriosis."

High soft tissue contrast makes it possible to differentiate tissues, particularly in the case of serous, mucinous and haemorrhagic fluid collections, as well as solid and fat-containing tissue. High sensitivity may be expected in the demonstration of dermoid and endometrial cysts. The distinction between benign and malignant lesions must, however, be based on morphological criteria.

Fertility-sparing treatments have been successfully attempted in selected cases of cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancer, and gynaecologists should be familiar with fertility-preserving options in women with gynaecological malignancies. Options to preserve fertility include shielding to reduce radiation damage, fertility preservation when undergoing cytotoxic treatments, cryopreservation, assisted reproduction techniques, and fertility-sparing surgical procedures. Radical vaginal trachelectomy with laparoscopic lymphadenectomy is an oncologically safe, fertility-preserving procedure. It has been accepted worldwide as a surgical treatment of small early stage cervical cancers. Selected cases of early stage ovarian cancer can be treated by unilateral salpingo-ophorectomy and surgical staging. Hysteroscopic resection and progesterone treatment are used in young women who have endometrial cancer to maintain fertility and avoid surgical menopause. Appropriate patient selection, and careful oncologic, psychologic, reproductive and obstetric counselling, is mandatory."

PET is expensive, has limited anatomic detail, and it may be difficult to differentiate benign ovarian lesions from malignant lesions when PET is used. A 43-year-old female volunteer's PET scan revealed increased uptake in the left ovary. A subsequent extensive evaluation was entirely normal; however, the patient pursued excision with only a corpus luteum on final pathology. There is a dearth of information regarding PET scan ovarian abnormalities in asymptomatic premenopausal patients, as much of the literature focuses on women with a known ovarian lesion or cancer. Our case represents an increasingly common situation: evaluation and management of an asymptomatic woman with a positive PET scan. As more clinicians encounter PET scan abnormalities, it is imperative that the medical literature documents the limitations of this technology, especially in premenopausal women."

The results were compared with the serum levels of the CA 125 antigen. At a cutoff level of 135 U/l for TPS and 20 U/l for CA 125 (95th percentile of the healthy controls), the sensitivity of the tests for detecting a malignant tumor was 77% for TPS and 87% for CA 125. The specificities were 85% for TPS and 92% for CA 125. Adding TPS to CA 125 did not increase the diagnostic values compared to using the CA 125 test alone. For both markers, the rate of positivity was higher in advanced stage than in early-stage ovarian cancer. No correlation between marker levels and survival was found. Serial determinations performed with 4 patients during therapy and follow-up showed that both TPS and CA 125 are good predictors of tumor response and recurrence."

Relevant sources were identified by a search of PUBMED from January 1950 to January 2009 using the key words Robot or Robotics and Cervical cancer, Endometrial cancer, Gynecologic oncology, and Ovarian cancer. Appropriate case reports, case series, retrospective studies, prospective trials, and review articles were selected. A total of 38 articles were identified on the subject, and 27 were included in the study. The data for gynecologic cancer show comparable results between robotic and laparoscopic surgery for estimated blood loss, operative time, length of hospital stay, and complications. Overall, there were more wound complications with the laparotomy approach compared with laparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopy. There were more lymphocysts, lymphoceles, and lymphedema in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group compared with the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups in patients with cervical cancer. Infectious and lung-related morbidity, postoperative ileus, and bleeding or clot formation were more commonly reported in the laparotomy group compared with the other 2 cohorts in patients with endometrial cancer. Computer-enhanced technology may enable more surgeons to convert laparotomies to laparoscopic surgery with its associated benefits. It seems that in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons, final outcomes are the same with or without use of the robot. There is good evidence that robotic surgery facilitates laparoscopic surgery, with equivalent if not better operative time and comparable surgical outcomes, shorter hospital stay, and fewer major complications than with surgeries using the laparotomy approach."

CD009786,0,8163617,0,[Voluminous ovarian cyst in children. Therapeutic strategy].,"Ovarian cysts are rare in children but can sometimes become extremely large, leading to difficult therapeutic decisions. There is general agreement that the therapeutic attitude for benign serous cysts less than 5 cm in diameter includes echographic monitoring and possible echo-guided punction. For cysts larger than 5 cm, most authors favour cystectomy via the celioscopic route using either celio-surgery or mini-laparotomy. On the contrary, the clinical manifestations of large cysts greater than 15 cm in diameter may vary greatly, presenting as increased abdominal volume, pain, respiratory impairment. The large size of the cyst should not be allowed to mask an associated torsion of the annexes in cases of paroxysmal abdominal pain. We report our experience of 6 voluminous ovarian cysts with a largest diameter varying between 15 and 40 cm. The children's age varied from 10 to 15 years. There were 3 dermoid cysts, 2 treated by ovariectomy and 1 by celio-surgery, 1 torsion of the annexes on dermoid cyst was treated via laparotomy. There were two cases of mucinous cystadenomas, 1 treated by mini-laparatomy and the other by celio-surgery. Finally one serous cyst with torsion of the annex was treated by annexectomy. The large size of the cysts may impair the surgical approach. Prudent ceilo-surgery should be preferred to wide laparotomy. Introduction should be performed under visual control followed by leak-free punction. The cyst is emptied before exeresis of the ovary via a mini-laparotomy since, in many of these cases of voluminous tumours, cystectomy cannot always be performed and ovariectomy must be preferred."

The incidence of spillage and recurrence rate of laparoscopic ovarian dermoid cystectomy, the duration of the surgical procedure, the length of hospitalization, the incidence of recurrence and pregnancies was evaluated. In 2.5% of cases, the endobag ruptured during removal, and a total spillage rate of 12% was seen. No signs or symptoms of peritonitis were observed regardless of cystic spillage or not. Laparoscopic cystectomy of dermoid cysts in premenopausal women is safe and effective and appears to be a valuable alternative to laparotomy.

CD009786,0,11176227,0,Risk of spread of ovarian cancer after laparoscopic surgery.,"The incidence of the spread of ovarian cancer after laparoscopic surgery is difficult to establish from the current literature. The prognosis incidence of a trocar site metastasis without peritoneal dissemination is not known. Data from general surgeons in prospective studies from a single institution suggested that in colon cancer the risk is low, whereas it seems to be much higher in multicentric studies of undiagnosed gallbladder cancer. Experimental studies suggested that laparoscopy has advantages and disadvantages. However, the risk of dissemination is high when a large number of malignant cells and a carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum are present, a situation encountered when managing adnexal tumours with large vegetations. Animal studies will allow the development of a peritoneal environment adapted to the treatment of cancer. The ovary is an intraperitoneal organ and ovarian cancer a peritoneal disease, so the risk of peritoneal spread may be higher in ovarian cancer than in other gynecological cancers. A careful preoperative evaluation appears to be the best way to prevent these risks. It should also be used to choose which patient should be operated by which surgical team. The second step is a careful and cautious laparoscopic diagnosis, so that more than 98% of ovarian cancers encountered can be treated immediately and effectively. The laparoscopic management of ovarian cancer remains controversial; it should be performed only in prospective clinical trials. Until the results of such studies become available, an immediate vertical midline laparotomy remains the gold standard if a cancer is encountered."

It has been clearly demonstrated that this technique is superior to abdominal hysterectomy and oophorectomy via laparotomy, and often replaces this procedure. In cases where vaginal hysterectomy is likely to prove difficult or impossible in the hands of most surgeons, the laparoscopic route is of value. In those cases where dense pelvic adhesions or poor vaginal access exist, or where oophorectomy is co-indicated, laparoscopic surgery converts operation via laparotomy to a less invasive procedure, with consequent benefits in terms of both patient care and bed occupancy. In the case of malignant disease, laparoscopic hysterectomy and oophorectomy is a viable alternative to open abdominal hysterectomy, but great care must be taken that patients with malignant disease are not under-treated."

Salpingoscopy, ovarian cystoscopy and endo-ovarian surgery with the argon laser.","Salpingoscopy gives detailed visual information on the mucosal pattern of the tubal ampulla as far as the isthmoampullary junction. With experience it takes 10 minutes to perform salpingoscopy on both sides and with an additional dye test a most complete evaluation of tubal morphology and patency can be obtained during routine diagnostic laparoscopy. Comparative studies proved the technique to be superior to HSG and the laparoscopic inspection of the tubal serosa and of the fimbriae. In some instances, like a tubocornual block, only salpingoscopy can provide additional information. Eventually, with the current techniques of operative laparoscopy salpingoscopic inspection of a phimosis or even a hydrosalpinx can be performed quite easily and these findings help us in the clinical management of patients requiring either microsurgical cuff-salpingostomy (giving a more realistic chance of a spontaneous pregnancy every month) or in vitro fertilization (avoiding laparotomy). Salpingoscopy also guides us in the selection of patients for a GIFT procedure and probably provides a better estimation of the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian cystoscopy can be applied for accurate diagnosis of non-malignant ovarian cysts at the time of laparoscopy. The wall of the cyst is inspected in detail and selective biopsies are obtained. Unnecessary surgery for non-neoplastic tumours can be avoided and endometrial and cystic tumours can be treated in situ using an argon laser with minimal surgical damage to the ovarian capsule.

CDE imaging is characterized by an increased sensitivity to flow, and thus may be useful in low-flow states and when optimal Doppler angles cannot be obtained. In addition, longer segments of vessels and more individual vessels can be visualized with CDE imaging. The role of CDE imaging in the evaluation of stromal vasculature in normal and in polycystic ovaries is described, and the relationship between follicular vascularity and outcome following in-vitro fertilization are discussed, together with the findings obtained from the evaluation of thecal arteriole of corpus luteum in early pregnancy. The fundamental role of CDE imaging in differentiation among ovarian masses is also reviewed. We summarize the role of CDE imaging in pregnancy, and describe two new applications of three-dimensional power Doppler sonography and the use of ultrasound contrast media. In conclusion, CDE imaging can replace conventional colour Doppler when the information on the direction of flow is not useful. Moreover, the technique appears superior to others for describing microvascular architecture and determining the presence or absence of flow."

By reviewing the literature and presenting some new data, we attempt to elucidate the applications of operative videolaparoscopy in gynecologic oncology. Advanced laparoscopic techniques are utilized for the management of cervical cancer as well as the staging and treatment of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Such techniques are used in performing radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer, pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy, and second look laparoscopy following chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. Even though preliminary data are encouraging, large prospective controlled studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to better define the role and limitations of laparoscopy in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies."
CD009786,0,9050607,0,Laparoscopic excision of benign dermoid cysts with controlled intraoperative spillage.,"Due to the risk of aseptic peritonitis associated with intraoperative rupture of dermoid cysts, many surgeons are reluctant to remove the lesions laparoscopically. In our series, 12 dermoid cysts were removed laparoscopically. Intraoperative spillage occurred in all cases and was managed with copious lavage. None of the patients experienced postoperative morbidity associated with peritonitis, indicating that intraoperative spillage of dermoid cysts is not associated with morbidity as long as vigorous lavage is performed."

CD009786,0,17145485,0,Health technology assessment of surgical therapies for benign gynaecological disease.,"This chapter summarises the evidence of the benefits and harm of surgical therapies for benign gynaecological disease. We have limited the discussion in this chapter to three gynaecological conditions - menorrhagia, endometriosis and benign ovarian tumours - with a further section on the different surgical approaches for performing a hysterectomy for menorrhagia due to dysfunctional uterine bleeding and pelvic masses such as fibroids and benign adnexal masses. The currently available evidence suggests that there is little to choose between the four first-generation endometrial destruction techniques - laser ablation, transcervical resection of endometrium, vaporisation ablation and rollerball ablation - in terms of clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction. There is a paucity of evidence with regards to the comparison of the different second-generation endometrial-destruction techniques but current evidence suggests that bipolar radiofrequency ablation is more effective than thermal balloon ablation for treating menorrhagia. Overall, the second-generation techniques are at least as effective as first-generation methods but are easier to perform and can be done under local rather than general anaesthesia in some circumstances. Hysteroscopic endometrial ablation is an alternative to hysterectomy and should be offered to women with menorrhagia because of its high satisfaction rates, shorter operation time, shorter hospital stay, earlier recovery and reduced postoperative complications; hysterectomy remains the surgical option of choice for women with intractable menorrhagia despite repeated endometrial ablations and for those who do not wish under any circumstances to continue to have menstrual bleeding. The combined use of laparoscopic laser ablation, adhesiolysis and uterine nerve ablation has been shown to have a beneficial effect on pelvic pain associated with mild to moderate endometriosis. Current evidence also supports the use of laparoscopic treatment of minimal and mild endometriosis to improve the on-going pregnancy and live birth rate in infertile patients. The current available evidence suggests that the laparoscopic approach is superior to laparotomy for the surgical management of benign ovarian cysts. It results in less postoperative pain and a shorter postoperative hospital stay; it also costs less. With regards to the surgical approach for performing a hysterectomy for menorrhagia and benign pelvic masses, vaginal hysterectomy should be performed over laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy when possible. Where it is not possible to perform the hysterectomy vaginally, then laparoscopic hysterectomy can be employed instead of abdominal hysterectomy to avoid a laparotomy scar. There appears to be no significant advantage in performing a subtotal hysterectomy instead of the total removal of the uterine corpus and cervix."
CD009786,0,23142076,0,Is perioperative visual estimation of intra-abdominal tumor spread reliable in ovarian cancer surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy?,"Most cases of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are diagnosed in an advanced stage. When the disease has spread intra-abdominally, complete surgical tumor debulking is the single most important prognostic factor. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) before surgery can cause fibrosis and adhesions in the peritoneal cavity and may interfere with the perioperative evaluation of tumor spread. In this prospective study, we evaluated whether perioperative visual assessment of tumor dissemination is similar in patients undergoing primary and interval surgery for EOC."
CD009786,0,16261563,0,Ovarian repositioning in pediatric cancer patients: Flexible techniques accommodate pelvic radiation fields.,"Treatments for childhood cancer and consequent long-term survival rates continue to improve. As the success of these therapies advances, premature ovarian failure and sterility have become an increasingly evident long-term morbidity. Abdominal and pelvic radiation have been specifically shown to induce early menopause and decreased fertility. In order to minimize radiation injury, we utilized novel techniques to reposition ovaries in two girls with pelvic tumors prior to initiation of pelvic radiation. One girl with a sacral Ewing sarcoma underwent laparoscopic anterior suspension of the ovaries, using a simple and easily reversible technique. The second patient, who underwent hysterectomy for a recurrent uterine rhabdomyosarcoma, underwent widely lateral and cephalad repositioning of the ovaries. Both procedures were well tolerated, with no significant morbidity. In both cases the ovaries were moved well beyond the planned radiation field. We propose that open or laparoscopic ovarian repositioning in children is a simple, flexible, and reversible option to reduce radiation injury to the ovaries in pediatric cancer patients."
CD009786,0,2935446,0,[Preoperative laparoscopy for determination of the surgical approach].,"131 selected patients underwent preoperative laparoscopy directly before surgery and under the same anaesthesia during the period 1981-1984. In all 131 patients several findings were present in combined form that would have permitted abdominal surgery only, provided laparoscopy had not been performed. 49 patients were operated upon via the abdominal approach even though they had been subjected to laparoscopy. In 82 patients, the more favourable vaginal approach was rendered complicated by additional findings (in 22, antefixating preliminary operations on the uterus after Doléris or Baldy; in 29, cystic adnexal tumours; in 31, adhesions or unclear conditions of pain following known or unknown previous surgery). By preceding surgery by laparoscopy it became possible to treat these patients in such a manner that the subsequent vaginal operation was without risk and free from complications. Preoperative laparoscopy extends, enables and safeguards the indication for vaginal surgical approach if used with the necessary critical discrimination."

However, the degree to which such results are achievable outside the context of formal research programs and the actual extent of laparoscopy uptake since its introduction are unclear. Purpose of this study was to examine the impact upon operative and cancer outcomes of the incorporation of laparoscopy into the surgical practice of our gynecologic oncology service."
CD009786,0,16873081,0,[Impact of surgical access on staging of early borderline and invasive tumors of the ovary].,"The objectives were to evaluate the impact of the surgical approach on the staging of borderline tumors and early-stage malignancies of the ovary. We retrospectively reviewed cases of borderline and invasive ovarian tumors stages Ia through Ic treated surgically between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 2001. We compared the rates of potentially harmful procedures according to the surgical approach. The quality of surgical staging was assessed by examining each required procedure and by determining a score. The influence of variables related to patient characteristics, preoperative workup, and initial surgery on staging quality was tested by univariate analysis. Variables independently associated with staging quality were entered in a logistic regression model. SPPS 7.5 and STATA 8 software was used for statistical tests. Of 118 patients with borderline tumors, 48 (41 %) underwent laparoscopic surgery, 54 (45 %) laparotomy, and 16 (14 %) laparoscopy converted to laparotomy. Surgery was conservative in 57 % of cases overall ; this proportion was significantly greater with laparoscopy than with laparotomy (p < 0.05) and in younger women (p < 0.001). Intraoperative tumor rupture occurred in 9 % of patients, with no significant difference across surgical approaches (p = 0.1). Bag extraction was used in 19 (40 %) of 48 laparoscopically treated patients. Staging was incomplete in 73 % of patients. By univariate analysis, bilateral adnexectomy and, to a lesser extent, age > 44 years, laparotomy, hysterectomy, and treatment after 1995 predicted at least partial staging. Factors independently associated with at least partial staging in the multivariate model were treatment after 1995, bilateral adnexectomy, and hysterectomy. Of 178 patients with invasive tumors, 34 underwent laparoscopic surgery, 114 laparotomy, and 30 conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy. The laparotomy group was characterized by significantly older patient age and larger tumors, compared to the laparoscopy group. Staging was often inadequate after initial surgery, most notably with low rates of paraaortic lymphadenectomy (0 % in the laparoscopy group, 18 % in the laparotomy group, and 33 % in the conversion group). Staging is often less complete with laparoscopy than with laparotomy. In patients with invasive cancer, inadequate initial staging is common, most notably when laparoscopy is used. The surgeons training seems of major importance."
CD009786,0,2533120,0,[Recurrent functional ovarian cysts following laparoscopy fenestration].,"The laparoscopic fenestration of functional ovarian cysts with a benign appearance is well known. After aspiration of the contents of the cyst, a window is cut in the cyst wall for an endocystic inspection. In this way, samples for cytology as well as histopathology are obtained. A laparoscopic fenestration was performed on 104 patients. During a mean follow-up time of 20 months, we found a recurrence of 8% in 91 patients. In the presence of pelvic adhesions, the functional cysts tend to reoccur. Corpus luteum cysts have a higher recurrence-rate than follicular cysts. In our study postoperative hormon-therapy recorded no protective effect."

CD009786,0,22313651,0,Pelvic-peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking ovarian cancer.,"Pelvic-peritoneal tuberculosis is a common extrapulmonary site in young females mimicking an advanced ovarian malignancy. We present 2 cases with the classical triad of advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma-ascites, abdominopelvic masses and elevated serum CA-125 levels. Laparoscopic examination revealed peritoneal nodules which on biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation and no malignant cells. Patients were started on anti-tuberculous therapy and on follow-up their symptoms as well as CA-125 levels normalized. Medical awareness of peritoneal tuberculosis is lacking and many young women with this disease undergo unnecessary extended surgery. Diagnostic laparoscopy combined with peritoneal biopsy seems to be a sufficient and safe method to provide a definitive diagnosis for this curable infection. If left untreated, the disease may disseminate and result in significant organ dysfunctions particularly infertility."
CD009786,0,16527722,0,"Laparoscopic approach to an endometriotic vault fistula causing posthysterectomy ""menstruation"".","Endometriosis is a commonly prevalent disease but can include rare complaints posing a challenge to surgical treatment. We describe an unreported cause of menstruation after hysterectomy, which was revealed as an endometriotic tubo-ovarian mass that fistulated into the vaginal vault. A 37-year-old woman experienced monthly vaginal bleeding after hysterectomy. At laparoscopy a tubo-ovarian endometriotic mass was revealed with a fistula into the vaginal vault. The mass was adherent to the left ureter and the sigmoid colon. Laparoscopic excision of the mass and fistula after ureterolysis and bowel dissection was performed. This case describes an unreported cause of posthysterectomy menstruation. The management outlines the optimal surgical management of laparoscopic techniques combined with vaginal access to achieve complete excision with minimal patient morbidity."

We report the case of a patient with a right ovarian teratoma, abnormal liver tests and pain in the right abdomen and shoulder, initially attributed to an acalculous cholecystitis. Before gynaecological surgery, a repeat ultrasound scan found several small avascular peritoneal masses at the upper dome of the liver, not reported in the initial examination. This prompted laparoscopic exploration of the subdiaphragmatic space, and the final diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis-syndrome was made. Such ultrasound finding appears to be a new diagnostic feature of this syndrome."

CD009786,0,9497606,0,[Borderline ovarian tumors: a series of 43 patients].,"Our objective was to evaluate the sonographic features, serum tumor markers in a series of 43 patients with borderline ovarian tumors. At sonographic examination, the majority of borderline tumors were multilocular. Serum CA-125 levels were elevated in 32.1%, CA-19-9 in 17.4%. In contrast, ACE levels were constantly normal. Twenty-four out of 43 patients (55.8%) had serous tumors, 18 (41.9%) had mucinous tumors and 1 (2.3%) had endometrioid tumor. Among, the 43 patients, 9 (20.9%) had first laparotomic approach and 34 had first laparoscopic treatment. Seven out of 34 patients treated by first laparoscopic approach had a laparoconversion (2 for presumption of invasive carcinoma and 5 for failure of laparoscopic procedure). Therefore, 27 had exclusive laparoscopic management. Among the 43 patients, 22 had conservative treatment and 21 radical surgery. The mean follow-up of patients was 41 months. Thirty-seven patients (86.1%) were alive without recurrence, 4 had a recurrence (9.3%), 1 patient (2.3%) was lost to follow-up and the last died of intercurrent disease. The mean delay of recurrence was 22 months (range 6 to 36). Three out of 4 recurrences occurred after cystectomy (2 ipsilateral and 1 controlateral). The fourth recurrence occurred after unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. All 10 second look procedures were negative. Our results point out about the feasibility of laparoscopic management of borderline tumors. However, cystectomy is associated with a high risk of recurrence."
