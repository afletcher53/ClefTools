CD011431,0,17984357,0,High prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection in Gabonese adults.,"Plasmodium falciparum, the most common malarial parasite in sub-Saharan Africa, accounts for a high number of deaths in children less than five years of age. In malaria-endemic countries with stable transmission, semi-immunity is usually acquired after childhood. For adults, severe malaria is rare. Infected adults have either uncomplicated malaria or asymptomatic parasitemia. During a period of one year, we screened 497 afebrile males to investigate the prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitemia in villages near Lambaréné, Gabon by use of three different methods. A total of 52% of the individuals had parasites detected by a subtelomeric variable open reading frame polymerase chain reaction (stevor-PCR), 27% of the rapid diagnostic test results were positive, and 12% of the thick blood smears with low parasitemias had P. falciparum. Most positive cases were only detected by the stevor-PCR. Asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitemia in adults living in a malaria-endemic country is frequent."
CD011431,0,19954532,0,Comparison of surveillance methods applied to a situation of low malaria prevalence at rural sites in The Gambia and Guinea Bissau.,"Health record-based observations from several parts of Africa indicate a major decline in malaria, but up-to-date information on parasite prevalence in West-Africa is sparse. This study aims to provide parasite prevalence data from three sites in the Gambia and Guinea Bissau, respectively, and compares the usefulness of PCR, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), serology and slide-microscopy for surveillance."

CD011431,0,21059211,0,A multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against 15 Plasmodium falciparum and Anopheles gambiae saliva antigens.,"Assessment exposure and immunity to malaria is an important step in the fight against the disease. Increased malaria infection in non-immune travellers under anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis, as well as the implementation of malaria elimination programmes in endemic countries, raises new issues that pertain to these processes. Notably, monitoring malaria immunity has become more difficult in individuals showing low antibody (Ab) responses or taking medications against the Plasmodium falciparum blood stages. Commonly available techniques in malaria seroepidemiology have limited sensitivity, both against pre-erythrocytic, as against blood stages of the parasite. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a sensitive tool to assess the exposure to malaria or to bites from the vector Anopheles gambiae, despite anti-malarial prophylactic treatment."

CD011431,0,17148078,1,Bedside diagnosis of imported malaria using the Binax Now malaria antigen detection test.,"Malaria may be misdiagnosed in non-endemic countries when the necessary experience for rapid expert microscopy is lacking. Rapid diagnostic tests may improve the diagnosis and may play a role as a bedside diagnostic tool. In a multicentre study we recruited patients suspected of malaria over a period of 14 months. The Binax Now Malaria rapid test was used at the bedside and in the clinical microbiology laboratory. The training of clinical staff was monitored and their experience with the use of the test was recorded. 542 patients were included, 80 of whom had malaria diagnosed by microscopy. The rapid test used at the bedside had a sensitivity of 88% for the detection of P. falciparum compared to 95% when the test was performed in the microbiology laboratory. The risk of technical problems and invalid tests was highest when the test was used at the bedside. The rapid diagnostic test may be useful for the diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria when used by routine laboratory staff, but could lead to misdiagnoses when used at the bedside. Microscopy is still essential in order to identify the few missed diagnoses, to determine the degree of parasitaemia, and to ensure species diagnosis, including mixed infections."
CD011431,0,22200962,0,Molecular test for vivax malaria with loop-mediated isothermal amplification method in central China.,"Vivax malaria has the highest incidence in central China. High-throughput and cost-effective testing methods are essential for vivax malaria diagnosis in this area. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an established nucleic acid amplification method, which provides a promising platform for the molecular detection of malaria parasites in development countries. This study was performed to compare the LAMP method, the nested PCR-based method, and microscopic examinations in diagnosing vivax malaria. LAMP detected vivax malaria parasites in 160 of 164 microscopically positive samples (sensitivity, 97.6%), whereas nested PCR detected Plasmodium vivax in 162 of 164 samples (sensitivity, 98.8%). No false-positive results were obtained by LAMP or nested PCR among fever-positive and healthy samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the two molecular tests were consistently high. In addition, the reproducibility of the LAMP assays using water bath, which reduced the cost substantially. LAMP method is an accurate, rapid, simple, and cost-effective method that may be useful for diagnosis in field diagnoses instead of nested PCR. This method is feasible to diagnose vivax malaria parasite in endemic areas of central China."
CD011431,0,17434795,0,The diagnosis of malaria and identification of plasmodium species by polymerase chain reaction in Turkey.,"More than half of the world's population is exposed to malaria in approximately 100 countries. Rapid diagnosis and correct treatment of cases are the main objectives of control programs in malaria endemic areas. We have developed a PCR method to determine the presence of plasmodium DNA in blood. The method can also identify the species of the plasmodium by restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified product. We evaluated the performance of this method in the diagnosis of malaria suspected cases in Turkey by comparing to microscopy of the blood smears: blood samples were obtained from 114 patients with malaria symptoms, including fever and/or chills lasting for several days, before starting treatment. Thin and thick blood smears were prepared immediately in the region of specimen collection. After isolation of DNA from blood samples, DNA was amplified by PCR and digested by restriction enzyme AluI. The obtained fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The number of parasites in the thick and thin smears of the blood samples was evaluated microscopically after staining by Giemsa and results were compared by PCR results. Among 114 plasmodium positive cases detected by microscopy, 100 were also detected by PCR. There were 14 false negatives and no false positive by PCR. Compared to microscopy, the sensitivity, specificity and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of PCR were determined as 76%, 100% and 100%, respectively."
CD011431,0,20218482,1,Field evaluation of a malaria rapid diagnostic test (ICT Pf).,"Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (MRDTs) are quick and easy to perform and useful for diagnosing malaria in primary health care settings. In South Africa most malaria infections are due to Plasmodium falciparurrm, and HRPII-based MRDTs have been used since 2001. Previous studies in Africa showed variability in sensitivity and specificity of HRPII-based MRDTs; hence, we conducted a field evaluation in Limpopo province to determine the accuracy of the MRDT currently used in public sector clinics and hospitals."
CD011431,0,21978238,1,Treatment guided by rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in Tanzanian children: safety and alternative bacterial diagnoses.,"WHO guidelines for the treatment of young children with suspected malaria have recently changed from presumptive treatment to anti-malarial treatment guided by a blood slide or malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT). However, there is limited evidence of the safety of this policy in routine outpatient settings in Africa."
CD011431,0,20232100,0,Evaluation of the Immunoquick+4 malaria rapid diagnostic test in a non-endemic setting.,"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the Immunoquick+4 (BioSynex, Strasbourg, France), a three-band malaria rapid diagnostic test (MRDT) targeting histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2) and pan Plasmodium-specific parasite lactate dehydrogenase, in a non-endemic reference setting. Stored whole-blood samples (n = 613) from international travellers suspected of malaria were used, with microscopy corrected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the reference method. Samples infected by P. falciparum (n = 323), P. vivax (n = 97), P. ovale (n = 73) and P. malariae (n = 25) were selected, as well as 95 malaria-negative samples. The overall sensitivities of the Immunoquick+4 for the diagnosis of P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale were 88.9, 75.3, 56.0 and 19.2%, respectively. Sensitivity was significantly related to parasite density for P. falciparum (93.6% versus 71.4% at parasite densities >100/microl and <or=100/microl, respectively) and P. vivax (86.8% versus 48.3% at parasite densities >500/microl and <or=500/microl, respectively). The Immunoquick+4 showed good reproducibility and reliability for both test results and line intensities. The Immunoquick+4 performed well for the detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax."

We assessed diversity in Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax aldolases by sequencing the coding genes from parasites of various origins. The results show that aldolases are highly conserved, indicating that antigenic diversity is not a cause of variable RDT sensitivity."

CD011431,0,23249688,1,Prevalence of PCR detectable malaria infection among febrile patients with a negative Plasmodium falciparum specific rapid diagnostic test in Zanzibar.,"We screened for malaria in 594 blood samples from febrile patients who tested negative by a Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein-2-based rapid diagnostic test at 12 health facilities in Zanzibar districts North A and Micheweni, from May to August 2010. Screening was with microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cytochrome b gene (cytbPCR) of the four major human malaria species, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The prevalence of cytbPCR-detectable malaria infection was 2% (12 of 594), including 8 P. falciparum, 3 Plasmodium malariae, and 1 Plasmodium vivax infections. Microscopy identified 4 of 8 P. falciparum infections. Parasite density as estimated by microscopy or qPCR was > 4,000 parasites/μL in 5 of 8 cytbPCR-detectable P. falciparum infections. The infections that were missed by the rapid diagnostic test represent a particular challenge in malaria elimination settings and highlight the need for more sensitive point-of-care diagnostic tools to improve case detection of all human malaria species in febrile patients."
CD011431,0,23136222,0,Defining falciparum-malaria-attributable severe febrile illness in moderate-to-high transmission settings on the basis of plasma PfHRP2 concentration.,"In malaria-endemic settings, asymptomatic parasitemia complicates the diagnosis of malaria. Histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) is produced by Plasmodium falciparum, and its plasma concentration reflects the total body parasite burden. We aimed to define the malaria-attributable fraction of severe febrile illness, using the distributions of plasma P. falciparum HRP2 (PfHRP2) concentrations from parasitemic children with different clinical presentations."
CD011431,0,22041470,0,Clinical profiles of 13 children with Plasmodium vivax cerebral malaria.,"Bikaner region is endemic for both P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria. Usually, cerebral malaria is caused by P. falciparum but it has been reported recently also in P. vivax mono-infection. Epidemiologic studies and clinical descriptions of P. vivax cerebral malaria in children are rare."
CD011431,0,12950138,1,Development and evaluation of an immunochromatographic kit for the detection of antibody to Plasmodium vivax infection in South Korea.,"Malaria is a major parasitic disease in tropical areas. Three to five hundred million people suffer from the disease and it kill a million people per year. Blood smear observation was developed for the diagnosis of malaria, but the examination needs skilled experts and exact diagnosis is time consuming. A kit based on immunochromatography can be a reliable and rapid method for clinical diagnosis, even in the hands of inexperienced personnel. However, all such currently developed kits can only diagnose P. falciparum malaria. In our previous report, the C-terminal region of P. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (PvcMSP) was cloned and expressed in E. coli. In the present study, we developed an immunochromatographic kit using this PvcMSP for the diagnosis of specific antibody to P. vivax malaria in serum samples. The kit was used to examine sera from vivax malaria patients and non-malaria- infected person and the test showed 100% sensitivity (78/78) and 98.3% specificity (58/59). This result demonstrated that the immunochromatographic kit for P. vivax antibody detection is applicable for the rapid and precise diagnosis of P. vivax malaria."
CD011431,0,23477559,0,Loop-mediated isothermal amplification test for the molecular diagnosis of malaria.,"Malaria is one of the most important infectious tropical diseases. Rapid and accurate diagnostics are the basis of therapeutic care for most febrile patients in field clinics and health centers where novel molecular techniques have overcome sensitivity and specificity limitations. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel molecular method for rapid DNA target amplification with high specificity in isothermal conditions. LAMP provides a simple and rapid diagnostic tool for the early detection and species-specific identification of Plasmodium parasites using the read-out of the LAMP with the naked eye in the field, with no requirement for expensive thermal cyclers. LAMP is readily applicable to clinical diagnosis and active surveillance of malaria parasites in reference laboratories and research centers of endemic countries as a new alternative molecular diagnostic solution. This article summarizes current technical developments, applications, limitations and the future prospects for malaria diagnosis using LAMP in developed countries and endemic areas."
CD011431,0,18510724,0,Access to artemisinin combination therapy for malaria in remote areas of Cambodia.,"Malaria-endemic countries are switching antimalarial drug policy to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) and the global community are considering the setting up of a global subsidy mechanism in order to make them accessible and affordable. However, specific interventions may be needed to reach remote at-risk communities and to ensure that they are used appropriately. This analysis documents the coverage with ACTs versus artemisinin monotherapies, and the effectiveness of malaria outreach teams (MOTs) and Village Malaria Workers (VMWs) in increasing access to appropriate diagnosis and treatment with ACTs in Cambodia, the first country to switch national antimalarial drug policy to an ACT of artesunate and mefloquine (A+M) in 2000."
CD011431,0,3898482,0,Imported malaria in Kuwait.,"The number of imported malaria cases in Kuwait rose from 87 in 1980 to 504 in 1983, an increase of 579%. The continued resurgence of malaria in endemic zones, improved diagnostic techniques and a heightened awareness of imported malaria have contributed to the increase in the number of microscopically proved cases. Thick blood films fixed in acetone and stained in Giemsa proved a rapid method of diagnosis; species identification on the basis of a thin film on the same slide was performed with ease. Malaria was acquired in 38 countries. Most patients were young male adults. Most of the cases were due to Plasmodium vivax originating from India, although an increasing number of P. falciparum cases are also now being diagnosed from there. P. falciparum infections were evenly distributed throughout the year and most cases presented within 14 days of their arrival in the country. The highest number of P. vivax cases were diagnosed between May and October, when heat stress might have been a factor in precipitating a clinical attack of an infection previously acquired in the endemic zone. Attention is drawn to the importance of delayed attacks of P. vivax and, in semi-immunes, of P. falciparum. The time interval involved in establishing a history of ""recent"" travel in clinically suspected cases of malaria needs to be more clearly defined in each geographical area. Cases of induced malaria due to transfusion, accidental and congenital infections were identified. The fatality rate due to P. falciparum infections was low. In terms of the risk of renewed transmission, Kuwait may be considered a vulnerable area."
CD011431,0,23102548,0,"Role of secondary level laboratories in strengthening quality at primary level health facilities' laboratories: an innovative approach to ensure accurate HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria test results in resource-limited settings.","Providing regular external quality assessment of primary level laboratories and timely feedback is crucial to ensure the reliability of testing capacity of the whole laboratory network. This study was aimed to assess the diagnostic performances of primary level laboratories in Southwest Showa Zone in Ethiopia. An external quality assessment protocol was devised whereby from among all the samples collected on-site at 4 health centers (HCs), each HC sent to a district hospital (DH) on a weekly basis 2 TB slides (1 Ziehl-Neelsen stained and another unstained), 2 malaria slides (1 Giemsa stained and another unstained), and 2 blood samples for HIV testing (1 whole blood and another plasma) for a comparative analysis. Similarly, the DH preserved the same amount and type of specimens to send to each HC for retesting. From October to November 2011, 192 single-blinded specimens were rechecked: 64 TB slides, 64 malaria slides, and 64 blood specimens for HIV testing. The analyses demonstrated an overall agreement of 95.3% (183/192) between the test and the retest, and 98.4% (63/64), 92.2% (59/64,) and 95.3% (61/64) for TB microscopy, malaria microscopy, and HIV rapid testing, respectively. Of the total TB slides tested positive, 20/23 (87%) were quantified similar in both laboratories. The agreement on HIV rapid testing was 100% (32/32) when plasma samples were tested either at HC (16/16) or at DH (16/16), while when whole blood specimens were tested, the agreement was 87.5% (14/16) and 93.8% (15/16) for samples prepared by HCs and DH, respectively. Results of this new approach proved that secondary laboratories could play a vital role in assuring laboratory qualities at primary level HCs, without depending on remotely located national and regional laboratories to provide this support."

Community-case management of malaria (CCMm), consisting of lay health workers (LHWs) using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in their villages, can address this disparity."
CD011431,0,12791849,1,Devices for rapid diagnosis of Malaria: evaluation of prototype assays that detect Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 and a Plasmodium vivax-specific antigen.,"The ParaSight F test was developed as a pioneer industry effort in the large-scale, process-controlled production of a device for the rapid diagnosis of malaria. This device performed well in field settings but was limited to the detection of a single malaria species, Plasmodium falciparum. The ParaSight F+V assay advanced upon the ParaSight F test format by incorporating a monoclonal antibody directed against a proprietary Plasmodium vivax-specific antigen, in addition to the antibody directed against P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2, which was used in the ParaSight F assay. The modified assay was developed to add the capability to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax in a single-test-strip format. The present study evaluated three distinct ParaSight F+V prototypes with samples from symptomatic patients in regions of Thailand and Peru where malaria is endemic. Over a 2-year enrollment period (1998 and 1999), a total of 4,894 patients consented to participation in the study. Compared with the results for duplicate microscopic examinations of Giemsa-stained blood smears as the reference diagnostic standard, each successive prototype showed substantial improvement in performance. The final ParaSight F+V prototype, evaluated in 1999, had an overall sensitivity for detection of asexual P. falciparum parasites of 98%. The sensitivity of the device was 100% for P. falciparum densities of >500 parasites/ micro l, with a sensitivity of 83% for parasite densities of </=500/ micro l. The specificity for the exclusion of P. falciparum was 93%. For P. vivax, the overall sensitivity was 87% for the final 1999 prototype. The sensitivities calculated for different levels of P. vivax parasitemia were 99% for parasite densities of >5,000/ micro l, 92% for parasite densities of 1,001 to 5,000/ micro l, 94% for parasite densities of 501 to 1,000/ micro l, and 55% for parasite densities of 1 to 500/ micro l. The specificity for the exclusion of P. vivax was 87%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the diagnostic performance of the assay for the detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax were 0.8907 and 0.8522, respectively. These findings indicate that assays for rapid diagnosis have the potential to enhance diagnostic capabilities in those instances in which skilled microscopy is not readily available."
CD011431,0,16046285,0,A new and simple solid-phase extraction method for LC determination of pyronaridine in human plasma.,"A new approach using a simple solid-phase extraction technique has been developed for the determination of pyronaridine (PND), an antimalarial drug, in human plasma. After extraction with C18 solid-phase sorbent, PND was analyzed using a reverse phase chromatographic method with fluorescence detection (at lambda(ex)=267 nm and lambda(em)=443 nm). The mean extraction recovery for PND was 95.2%. The coefficient of variation for intra-assay precision, inter-assay precision and accuracy was less than 10%. The quantification limit with fluorescence detection was 0.010 microg/mL plasma. The method described herein has several advantages over other published methods since it is easy to perform and rapid. It also permits reducing both, solvent use and sample preparation time. The method has been used successfully to assay plasma samples from clinical pharmacokinetic studies."
CD011431,0,17547098,0,"Malaria specific mortality in lowlands and highlands of Muheza district, north-eastern Tanzania.","Vital registration of causes of death in Tanzania is incomplete and many deaths occur outside health care settings. Verbal autopsies (VA) are used to determine the underlying cause of death, and the probable diagnosis helps to estimate reasonably cause-specific mortality. In this paper, we report findings of a verbal autopsy survey which involved eight villages in both low and highlands of Muheza district, north-eastern Tanzania. The survey was conducted following a rapid census, which was done to identify households that had lost one or more members within a period of two years from the date of census. Trained research assistants administered VA questionnaires to parents/close relatives. Two physicians reviewed each report independently and a third opinion was sought where there was discordant report between the two. A total of 9,872 households were surveyed and 134 deaths were recorded. A total of 96 (71.6%) deaths were from lowland villages representing high malaria transmission. Majority (72.4%) of the reported deaths occurred at home whilst 32.1% occurred at heath facility settings. Overall, severe malaria was the leading cause accounting for 34.3% of all deaths. Infants were most affected and accounted for 43.5% of the total deaths. Pulmonary tuberculosis ranked second (8.2%) cause of deaths and was exclusively confined to individuals > or = 15 years. Probable cause of death could not be determined in 13.4% of deaths. In conclusion, majority of deaths in rural north-eastern Tanzania occur at home and the immediate causes are usually unknown or not documented. These findings indicate that the verbal autopsy is a useful tool for detecting leading causes of death at community level in the absence of health facility-based data."

CD011431,0,22958259,0,Flexibility of mobile laboratory unit in support of patient management during the 2007 Ebola-Zaire outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.,"The mobile laboratory provides a safe, rapid and flexible platform to provide effective diagnosis of Ebola virus as well as additional differential diagnostic agents in remote settings of equatorial Africa. During the 2007 Democratic Republic of Congo outbreak of Ebola-Zaire, the mobile laboratory was set up in two different locations by two separate teams within a day of equipment arriving in each location. The first location was in Mweka where our laboratory took over the diagnostic laboratory space of the local hospital, whereas the second location, approximately 50 km south near Kampungu at the epicentre of the outbreak, required local labour to fabricate a tent structure as a suitable pre-existing structure was not available. In both settings, the laboratory was able to quickly set up, providing accurate and efficient molecular diagnostics (within 3 h of receiving samples) for 67 individuals, including four cases of Ebola, seven cases of Shigella and 13 cases of malaria. This rapid turn-around time provides an important role in the support of patient management and epidemiological surveillance."
CD011431,0,11781267,1,Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria parasites.,"Malaria presents a diagnostic challenge to laboratories in most countries. Endemic malaria, population movements, and travelers all contribute to presenting the laboratory with diagnostic problems for which it may have little expertise available. Drug resistance and genetic variation has altered many accepted morphological appearances of malaria species, and new technology has given an opportunity to review available procedures. Concurrently the World Health Organization has opened a dialogue with scientists, clinicians, and manufacturers on the realistic possibilities for developing accurate, sensitive, and cost-effective rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, capable of detecting 100 parasites/microl from all species and with a semiquantitative measurement for monitoring successful drug treatment. New technology has to be compared with an accepted ""gold standard"" that makes comparisons of sensitivity and specificity between different methods. The majority of malaria is found in countries where cost-effectiveness is an important factor and ease of performance and training is a major consideration. Most new technology for malaria diagnosis incorporates immunochromatographic capture procedures, with conjugated monoclonal antibodies providing the indicator of infection. Preferred targeted antigens are those which are abundant in all asexual and sexual stages of the parasite and are currently centered on detection of HRP-2 from Plasmodium falciparum and parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase or Plasmodium aldolase from the parasite glycolytic pathway found in all species. Clinical studies allow effective comparisons between different formats, and the reality of nonmicroscopic diagnoses of malaria is considered."

CD011431,0,8980591,1,ParaSight-F test to diagnose malaria in hypo-endemic and epidemic prone regions of Vietnam.,"The antigen capture ParaSight-F test was evaluated during a drug sensitivity survey in a hypoendemic region of northern Vietnam. When only asexual blood forms of P. falciparum were considered, sensitivity of ParaSight-F was 100%, specificity 88% (95% CI 95-80%), positive predictive value 68% (95% CI 85-50%) and negative predictive value 100%. ParaSight-F proved very convenient for rapid screening and selection of patients to enrol in a drug sensitivity study. In northern Vietnam, the introduction of the test as a routine diagnostic tool is not justified, considering its high cost, the necessity to carry out the treatment of presumptive Plasmodium vivax cases and the persistence of positive reactions following treatment. However, the test will be a valuable tool in remote areas in emergency situations, where rapid confirmation of a P. falciparum outbreak is required."

In a laboratory study, designed to test absolute detection limits, Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood was diluted with uninfected blood to known parasite concentrations ranging from 500 to 0.1 parasites per microlitre (P/microL). The 50% detection limits were: ICT1, 3.28; ICT2, 4.86; KAT, 6.36; MM, 9.37; CB, 11.42; DM, 12.40; Q, 16.98; PS, 20; AC, 31.15 and OP, 91.16 P/microL. A field study was carried out to test post-treatment specificity. Blood samples from malaria patients were tested with all products (except AC and DM) on the day of treatment and 3 and 7 days thereafter, against a gold standard of microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). OP and PS produced fewer false-positive results on day 7 (18 and 19%, respectively) than the other rapid tests (38-56%). However, microscopy, PCR, OP and PS disagreed largely as to which individuals remained positive. The tests were further compared with regard to general specificity, particularly cross-reactivity with rheumatoid factor, speed, simplicity, their ability to detect other species, storage requirements and general presentation."

For each patient, a thick/thin film and 5 rapid tests based on the detection of histidine-rich protein II (HRP-II) (Paracheck Pf dipstick and device, ParaHIT f, Malaria Rapid and BIO P.F.) were performed. Outcomes were validity, inter-reader reliability and 'ease of use in the field', measured by both the general characteristics of the test and by the opinion of the readers. About half (57%) of the patients were positive for P. falciparum. The Paracheck Pf (dipstick and device) was considered as the most appropriate for the use in the field, being sensitive (97%), moderately specific (88%), reliable (kappa coefficient = 0.97), easy to use and cheap (about US$ 0.5/test). The ParaHIT f represented a good alternative."
CD011431,0,11738704,0,Bioinformatics and the malaria genome: facilitating access and exploitation of sequence information.,"The torrent of sequence information unleashed by the various genome sequencing projects, including that of Plasmodium falciparum, will lead to an unprecedented increase in the data available for research purposes. The scientific community is struggling to develop ways to assimilate this information and ensure that it is fully analysed in a way that enables rapid development of new therapeutic and diagnostic advances. This is particularly so for the field of tropical medicine where many of the scientists have had limited training in the area of Bioinformatics and may be further hampered by poor access to the sequence data. A number of collections of malaria genome sequence are available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, however further improvements in these information resources are needed. In particular, there would be great benefit in integrating genomic sequence and functional genomics results with the large amount of pre-existing knowledge related to parasite biology and immunological interactions with the host. Attempts to achieve this include the PlasmoDB database, and the lessons learned in this effort could be of great utility to other organism-specific databases."
CD011431,0,22386676,0,Cerebral malaria: what is known and what is on research.,"Malaria is still the world's major important parasitic disease and is responsible for the death of more people than any other communicable disease except tuberculosis. A major change in recent years has been the recognition that severe malaria, predominantly caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is a complex multi-system disorder presenting with a range of clinical features. Some surviving patients have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioural difficulties and epilepsy, making cerebral malaria a leading cause of childhood neurodisability in the malaria transmission area. It is unclear how an intravascular parasite causes such brain injury. Understanding of these mechanisms is important to develop appropriate neuroprotective interventions. However, due to the high specificity of P. falciparum to the human host and to the fact that clinical studies in human are not always feasible, our knowledge about this syndrome mainly comes from autopsy studies which can only give us a limited view of this deadly syndrome. Efforts developed by the scientific community have shown that development of severe malaria probably results from a combination of parasite-specific factors such as adhesion and sequestration to the vascular endothelium, the release of bioactive molecules, together with host inflammatory responses and metabolic acidosis. Recent studies have shown that endothelial cells could play a central role in the onset of the severe malaria. Indeed, adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes to these cells could drive their activation, which could participate in the trigger of an immune response and haemostatic derangements. Moreover, death of endothelial cells could be at the origin of the blood-lung/brain barrier breakdown. Despite the efforts to find new mechanisms, which explain the physiopathology of severe malaria, research progress is slowed down by the lack of experimental models, which reproduce this complex multi-system disorder. In absence of a vaccine so far, the rapid diagnosis of the disease, an efficient treatment, a correct management and nursing care are the only weapons to control mortality due to P. falciparum. It is important to note that in the future, the treatment of severe malaria may involve adjuvant treatments in addition to a potent antimalarial drug. In the present review, we summarize both what is known and practically useful for a physician, and the most promising and current topics of research."
CD011431,0,12201580,0,Clinical and laboratory predictors of imported malaria in an outpatient setting: an aid to medical decision making in returning travelers with fever.,"No evidence-based information exists to guide clinicians for giving presumptive treatment to returning travelers when malaria is strongly suspected on clinical grounds but laboratory confirmation is not immediately available or is negative. A prospective study was conducted in travelers or migrants who sought care for fever to identify clinical and laboratory predictors of Plasmodium parasitemia. A total of 336 questionnaires were collected (97 malaria case patients and 239 controls). Multivariate regression analysis showed inadequate prophylaxis, sweating, no abdominal pain, temperature > or = 38 degrees C, poor general health, enlarged spleen, leucocytes < or = 10 x 10(3)/L, platelets < 150 x 10(3)/L, hemoglobin < 12 g/dL, and eosinophils < or = 5% to be associated with parasitemia. Enlarged spleen had the highest positive likelihood ratio for a diagnosis of malaria (13.6), followed by thrombopenia (11.0). Posttest probabilities for malaria were 85% with enlarged spleen and 82% with thrombopenia. A rapid assessment can thus help to decide whether a presumptive treatment should be given or not, especially when the results of the parasitological examination are not immediately available or are uncertain."

Reducing pediatric morbidity and mortality remains an essential challenge in these areas, where malaria and bacterial infections are the leading cause of death. In such settings, diagnostic tools that aid to overcome this problem are scarce and diagnosis relies mainly on clinical observations that can lead to incorrect treatment prescriptions. Currently, only malaria RDTs (rapid diagnostic tests) fulfill the criteria for a wide implementation under the operational conditions of resource-limited settings. New, affordable, simple and rapid diagnostic tools for bacterial diagnosis are crucial to guarantee adequate management of antibiotics. Serum biomarkers such as C-reactive protein or procalcitonin, used in developed countries, could form the basis for these tools. Few studies have, however, assessed their validity in malaria-endemic areas and data remain inconclusive. Viral diagnosis is not of highest priority in places where no specific etiological treatment is available and the presence of a virus cannot exclude bacterial/malarial coinfections. Although future studies may elucidate the diagnostic role of certain biomarkers in malaria-endemic areas, understanding the operational and sociological conditions of these settings will remain essential for the successful implementation of current and new diagnostic tools."

CD011431,0,16843832,0,Microwave-assisted tissue processing for same-day EM-diagnosis of potential bioterrorism and clinical samples.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the turnaround times, section and image quality of a number of more ""difficult"" specimens destined for rapid diagnostic electron microscopy (EM) after microwave-assisted processing. The results were assessed and compared with those of conventionally processed samples. A variety of infectious agents, some with a potential for bioterrorism, and liver biopsies serving as an example for routine histopathology samples were studied. The samples represented virus-producing cell cultures (such as SARS-coronavirus, West Nile virus, Orthopox virus), bacteria suspensions (cultures of Escherichia coli and genetically knockout apathogenic Bacillus anthracis), suspensions of parasites (malaria Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania major, Microsporidia cuniculi, Caenorhabditis elegans), and whole Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with microsporidia. Fresh liver samples and infected flies were fixed in Karnovsky-fixative by microwaving (20 min), all other samples were fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde or Karnovsky-fixative overnight or longer. Subsequently, all samples were divided to evaluate alternative processing protocols: one part of the sample was OsO4-postfixed, ethanol-dehydrated, Epon-infiltrated (overnight) in an automated tissue processor (LYNX, Leica), and polymerized at 60 degrees C for 48 h; in parallel the other part was microwave-assisted processed in the bench microwave device (REM, Milestone), including post-osmication and the resin block polymerization. The microwave-assisted processing protocol required at minimum 3 h 20 min: the respective epon resin blocks were uniformly polymerized allowing an easy sectioning of semi- and ultrathin sections. Sections collected on non-coated 200 mesh grids were stable in the electron beam and showed an excellent preservation of the ultrastructure and high contrast, thus allowing an easy, unequivocal and rapid assessment of specimens. Compared with conventional routine methods, microwave technology facilitates a significant reduction in sample processing time from days to hours without any loss in ultrastructural details. Microwave-assisted processing could, therefore, be a substantial benefit for the routine electron microscopic diagnostic workload. Due to its speed and robust performance it could be applied wherever a rapid electron microscopy diagnosis is required, e.g., if bioterrorism or emerging agents are suspected. Combining microwave technology with digital image acquisition, the 1-day diagnosis based on ultrathin section electron microscopy will become possible, with crucial or interesting findings being consulted or shared worldwide with experts using modern telemicroscopy tools via Internet."

CD011431,0,22818744,0,Comparison of placental blood microscopy and the ICT HRP2 rapid diagnostic test to detect placental malaria.,"Monitoring interventions to prevent malaria in pregnancy requires sensitive detection of placental infection. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are good candidates, but little information is available on their sensitivity on placental blood. We have evaluated the agreement (kappa coefficient) between microscopy and a Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based immuno-chromatographic test (ICT) on placental blood from 1151 women at delivery. Prevalences of placental infection by microscopy and RDT were 5.1% and 5.0%, respectively, showing 82.9% agreement (p<0.0001). Discordances were found at low parasitemias (<500 parasites/μL) or negative microscopy. The results suggest that the HRP2-RDTs from ICT diagnostics is a good alternative to microscopy for diagnosing placental malaria at delivery."

Fifteen confirmed visceral leishmaniasis cases (bone marrow aspiration positive), 120 tuberculosis, 58 leprosy, 15 malaria, 26 intestinal parasitic infection cases, 24 endemic healthy controls from adjacent to the study area, and 18 controls from Kathmandu (who had never visited the VL endemic areas) were tested for anti-leishmanial antibody agglutination titers. Two of the tuberculosis cases were positive for anti-leishmanial agglutinating antibodies at 1:800. All the visceral leishmaniasis confirmed cases were reactive to anti-leishmanial antibody at > or = 1:3,200. Other specimens were negative for serology. The sensitivity of the direct agglutination test was 100% and the specificity was 99.2%. The direct agglutination test had positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 99.2% respectively. The direct agglutination test has been found to be simple, rapid, reliable, economic, safe and adaptable to micro-techniques using microtiter plates. It is specific and sensitive.

CD011431,0,22782471,0,In vitro human cell-free expression system for synthesis of malaria proteins.,"In this study, we performed cell-free expression of Plasmodium proteins using the in vitro human cell-free protein expression systems for DNA and mRNA. Malaria rhoptry genes (PFc14_0344, PFc0120w, PY01759, PY00763, PY07482, and PY04666) and a Maurer's cleft gene (PfA0680c) identified from proteome analysis studies were cloned into the pT7CFE1-CHis expression vector. Following a coupled transcription-translation procedure, expressed proteins were analyzed by His-tag staining and by western blotting using protein specific antibodies and nickel-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for histidine detection. Antibodies against whole rhoptries of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii merozoites and antibodies specific for the PfMC-2TM protein identified translated proteins. The rhoptry specific antibodies exhibited cross reactivity among the expressed proteins of P. falciparum and P. yoelii.

CD011431,0,23593309,0,Genetic surveillance detects both clonal and epidemic transmission of malaria following enhanced intervention in Senegal.,"Using parasite genotyping tools, we screened patients with mild uncomplicated malaria seeking treatment at a clinic in Thiès, Senegal, from 2006 to 2011. We identified a growing frequency of infections caused by genetically identical parasite strains, coincident with increased deployment of malaria control interventions and decreased malaria deaths. Parasite genotypes in some cases persisted clonally across dry seasons. The increase in frequency of genetically identical parasite strains corresponded with decrease in the probability of multiple infections. Further, these observations support evidence of both clonal and epidemic population structures. These data provide the first evidence of a temporal correlation between the appearance of identical parasite types and increased malaria control efforts in Africa, which here included distribution of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria detection, and deployment of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). Our results imply that genetic surveillance can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of disease control strategies and assist a rational global malaria eradication campaign."

CD011431,0,3059666,0,Recent applications of the Dot-ELISA in immunoparasitology.,"The dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dot-ELISA) is a highly versatile solid-phase immunoassay for antibody or antigen detection. The assay uses minute amounts of reagent dotted onto solid surfaces such as nitrocellulose and other paper membranes which avidly bind proteins. After incubation with antigen-specific antibody and enzyme-conjugated anti-antibody, the addition of a precipitable, chromogenic substrate causes the formation of a colored dot on the solid phase which is visually read. The Dot-ELISA has been used extensively in the detection of human and veterinary protozoan and metazoan parasitic diseases, including amebiasis, babesiosis, fascioliasis, cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, malaria, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, trichinosis, trypanosomiasis and even ixodid tick infestation. The technique is rapid, easy to perform and interpret, reagent conservative, cost effective and field portable. In addition, the Dot-ELISA may be configured to detect antibodies or parasite antigen in either microtiter plates for large-batch testing or with dipsticks for small numbers of determinations. A slight modification of the Dot-ELISA procedure allows the determination of infection rates of vectors such as ticks and sandflies with parasites."

Recently, a Plasmodium vivax-specific RDT [based on identification of species-specific lactate dehydrogenase (PvLDH)] became available, which along with PfHRP2 may improve malaria diagnosis by identifying the species correctly. A cross-sectional hospital-based study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FalciVax, a commercially available PfHRP2- and PvLDH-based RDT (index test), using malaria microscopy as a reference standard. All consecutive inpatients who presented with fever underwent both the index test and the reference standard. The study sample included 657 patients and the overall sensitivity and specificity of the RDT for diagnosis of any malarial species were 92.9% and 98.4%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy estimates for correct species identification were lower (sensitivity 91.8%, specificity 96.8%).

These interventions broadly follow WHO guidelines and international recommendations and are based on interventions that have proved successful in other parts of Africa. Most performance indicators are satisfactory but, paradoxically, despite the mobilization of considerable human and financial resources, the malaria-fighting programme in Niger seems to have stalled, as it has not yet yielded the expected significant decrease in malaria burden. Indeed, the number of malaria cases reported by the National Health Information System has actually increased by a factor of five over the last decade, from about 600,000 in 2000 to about 3,000,000 in 2010. One of the weaknesses of the national reporting system is that the recording of malaria cases is still based on a presumptive diagnosis approach, which overestimates malaria incidence."

To distinguish five species of the complex that occur in Thailand, a method using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed. The method utilizes allele-specific amplification to detect fixed differences between the species in the DNA sequence of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2. Primers were designed to amplify fragments of diagnostic length from the DNA of the different species. The method was tested on 179 mosquitoes of the An. dirus complex from many parts of Thailand and shown to be effective. Every specimen was unambiguously identified as species A, B, C, D or F (i.e. An. dirus s.s. species B, C, D or An. nemophilous, respectively) by the PCR method, with confirmation of 58/61 identifications from polytene chromosome characteristics. For the other three specimens (3/44 from Kanchanaburi 5 locality), there was disagreement between the PCR and chromosomal methods of species identification (probably due to errors in the chromosomal identifications). Primers can be combined in a single PCR reaction providing a rapid, sensitive and straightforward method of species identification. Only small quantities of DNA are required, leaving most of the mosquito to be used for other analyses."
CD011431,0,21995286,0,Genomics and integrated systems biology in Plasmodium falciparum: a path to malaria control and eradication.,"The first draft of the human malaria parasite's genome was released in 2002. Since then, the malaria scientific community has witnessed a steady embrace of new and powerful functional genomic studies. Over the years, these approaches have slowly revolutionized malaria research and enabled the comprehensive, unbiased investigation of various aspects of the parasite's biology. These genome-wide analyses delivered a refined annotation of the parasite's genome, delivered a better knowledge of its RNA, proteins and metabolite derivatives, and fostered the discovery of new vaccine and drug targets. Despite the positive impacts of these genomic studies, most research and investment still focus on protein targets, drugs and vaccine candidates that were known before the publication of the parasite genome sequence. However, recent access to next-generation sequencing technologies, along with an increased number of genome-wide applications, is expanding the impact of the parasite genome on biomedical research, contributing to a paradigm shift in research activities that may possibly lead to new optimized diagnosis and treatments.

However, light microscopy, established over 100 years ago and frequently considered the reference standard for clinical diagnosis, has been neglected in control programmes and in the malaria literature and evidence suggests field standards are commonly poor. Microscopy remains the most accessible method for parasite quantitation, for drug efficacy monitoring, and as a reference of assessing other diagnostic tools.

CD011431,0,9015508,0,Clinical overlap between malaria and severe pneumonia in Africa children in hospital.,"Data collected from 200 children admitted to a hospital on the Kenyan coast who met a broad definition of severe acute respiratory infection (ARI) indicated that simple clinical signs alone are unable absolutely to distinguish severe ARI and severe malaria. However, laboratory data showed that marked differences exist in the pathophysiology of unequivocal malaria and unequivocal ARI. Children in the former group had a higher mean oxygen saturation (97 vs. 94, P < 0.001), mean blood urea level (5.3 vs. 1.9 mmol/L, P < 0.001) and geometric mean lactate level (4.5 vs. 2.1 mmol/L, P < 0.001), and lower mean haemoglobin level (5.3 vs. 9.0 g/dL, P < 0.001) and base excess (-9.4 vs. -2.6, P < 0.001) than those in the latter group. Using these discriminatory variables it was estimated that up to 45% of children admitted with respiratory signs indicative of severe ARI probably had malaria as the primary diagnosis. Radiological examination supported this conclusion, indicating that pneumonia characterized by consolidation was uncommon in children with respiratory signs and a high malarial parasitaemia (> or = 10,000/microliters). There is no specific radiological sign of severe malaria. In practice, all children with respiratory signs warranting hospital admission in a malaria endemic area should be treated for both malaria and ARI unless blood film examination excludes malaria. In those with malaria and clinical evidence of acidosis, but no crackles, antibodies may be withheld while appropriate treatment for dehydration and anaemia is given. However, if clinical improvement is not rapid, antibiotics should be started."

We suggest a diagnostic strategy based on the use of microscopy and rapid antigen-detection tests. Treatment depends on the Plasmodium species and the severity of illness. For uncomplicated malaria, a drug combination that includes an artemisinin derivative should be used in priority. Atovaquone/proguanil represents an alternative.

CD011431,0,9988333,1,Immunocapture diagnostic assays for malaria using Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH).,"We have developed two diagnostic assays based on the specific detection of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) activity. These assays exploit a panel of monoclonal antibodies that capture the parasite enzyme and allow for the quantitation and speciation of human malaria infections. An immunocapture pLDH activity assay (ICpLDH) allows for the rapid purification and measurement of pLDH from infected blood using the NAD analog APAD, which reacts specifically with Plasmodium LDH isoforms. An immunochromatographic test (the OptiMAL assay) was also formatted and allowed the detection of parasite infections of approximately 200 parasites/microl of blood. By using a combination of antibodies, both tests can not only detect but differentiate between P. falciparum and non-P. falciparum malaria. Both assays show a sensitivity comparable with other commercial nonmicroscopic tests; importantly, we found very few instances of false-positive samples, especially with samples from patients recently cleared of malaria infection. Furthermore, we find that when one uses the quantitative ICpLDH assay, the levels of pLDH activity closely mirror the levels of parasitemia in both initial diagnosis and while following patient therapy. We conclude that diagnostic tests based on the detection of pLDH are both sensitive and practical for the detection, speciation, and quantitation of all human Plasmodium infections and can also be used to indicate drug-resistant infections."

In all, 526 fever cases were screened for Plasmodium falciparum in October or November, 1999. Those found to be infected were treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and primaquine. Using microscopy as the gold standard, the new test had a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 87%. The positive and negative predictive values were 88% and 98%, respectively. Although follow-up of 64 subjects on day 7 post-treatment revealed that 20% of those who then appeared smear-negative were still antigenaemic, 34% of the subjects were still smear-positive, for asexual parasites, at that time. The Determine test was found to be very easy to perform and the results could be read reliably by field workers, without any supervision. The ease of use of the test indicates that it could be useful in the management of malaria, particularly in remote and inaccessible areas, provided that its accuracy can be assured and that it can be made affordable."

CD011431,0,15152184,0,"Multifocal autochthonous transmission of malaria--Florida, 2003.","The majority of malaria cases diagnosed in the United States are imported, usually by persons traveling from areas where malaria is endemic. However, small outbreaks of locally acquired mosquito-borne malaria continue to occur. During July-September 2003, an outbreak of malaria (eight cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria) occurred in Palm Beach County, Florida. During the same period, two patients were evaluated for malaria in neighboring Okeechobee County, approximately 75 miles from the Palm Beach County transmission area. One patient was thought to have acquired infection with the same parasite species (P. vivax), and concerns were raised about a possible link. To determine whether infection was acquired in Okeechobee County and whether a possible link existed to the Palm Beach County outbreak, the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) initiated an investigation. This report describes that investigation, which determined that although initial laboratory results suggested local transmission, subsequent evaluation and testing confirmed the case as imported malaria. These findings underscore the importance of a rapid and thorough investigation of any malaria case suspected to be acquired through local mosquito-borne transmission."

While rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer great potential to improve malaria diagnosis, the sensitivity of RDTs has been reported to be highly variable. One possible factor contributing to variable test performance is the diversity of parasite antigens. This is of particular concern for Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)-detecting RDTs since PfHRP2 has been reported to be highly variable in isolates of the Asia-Pacific region."

The RDTs detect malaria parasite antigen(s) in whole blood with high sensitivity and specificity. We assessed health worker malaria treatment practices after the introduction of RDTs in peripheral health facilities without microscopy. From December 2007 to October 2008, we introduced histidine-rich protein II (HRP-2)-based ParaHIT RDTs for routine use in 12 health facilities in Rufiji District, Tanzania. Health workers received training on how to perform RDTs for patients 5 years of age or older with fever or suspected malaria. Children < 5 years of age were to be treated empirically per national guidelines. Among the 30,195 patients seen at these 12 health facilities, 10,737 (35.6%) were tested with an RDT for malaria. 88.3% (9,405/10,648) of tested patients reported fever or history of fever and 2.7% (289/10,677) of all tested individuals were children < 5 years of age. The RDT results were recorded for 10,650 patients (99.2%). Among the 5,488 (51.5%) RDT-positive patients, 5,256 (98.6%) were treated with an appropriate first-line antimalarial per national guidelines (artemether-lumefantrine or quinine). Among the 5,162 RDT-negative patients, only 205 (4.0%) were treated with an antimalarial. Other reported treatments included antibiotics and antipyretics. Implementation of RDTs in rural health facilities resulted in high adherence to national treatment guidelines. Patients testing negative by RDT were rarely treated with antimalarials. Unapproved antimalarials were seldom used. Health workers continued to follow guidelines for the empiric treatment of febrile children."
CD011431,0,23133635,0,Development of a novel fluorophore for real-time biomonitoring system.,"Rapid in-field diagnosis is very important to prevent the outbreak of various infectious and contagious diseases. Highly sensitive and quantitative detection of diseases can be performed using fluorescent immunochemical assay with specific antigen-antibody binding and a good quality fluorophore. This can lead to the development of a small, portable, quantitative biosensor to transmit diagnostic results to a control center in order to systematically prevent disease outbreaks. In this study, we developed a novel fluorophore, coumarin-derived dendrimer, with high emission intensity, strong signal brightness, and high photostability. It is easily coupled with biomolecules and emits strong and stable fluorescence at 590 nm with excitation at 455 nm. Application to fluorescent immunochromatographic test (FICT) showed that the novel coumarin-derived dendrimer bioconjugate could detect antigens at amount as low as 0.1 ng. The clinical results and the spectral characteristics of the novel coumarin-derived dendrimer open, for the first time, the possibility of developing a cost/energy efficient LED-based portable quantitative biosensor for point-of-care (POC) disease diagnosis, which can permit real time monitoring (U-healthcare system) by a disease control center."
CD011431,0,18458305,0,Detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein II in saliva of malaria patients.,"Detection of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in patients with malaria necessitates drawing blood, which increases the risk of accidental infections and is poorly accepted in communities with blood taboos. Thus, non-invasive, cost-effective malaria tests that minimize the need for blood collection are needed. Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein II (PfHRP II) levels in plasma and saliva were compared in malaria-positive and -negative patients in Ghana. Plasma and saliva obtained from 30 thick-film positive and 10 negative children were evaluated for PfHRP II by ELISA. Among the 30 children with positive blood smear, 16 (53%) were PfHRP II positive in plasma and 13 (43%) had PfHRP II positive saliva. The sensitivity of PfHRP II detection was 53% for plasma and 43% for saliva. The specificity was 100% with no false positive for both plasma and saliva when compared with blood smear. Thus, rapid detection of PfHRP II antigen in saliva may be a useful non-invasive and cost-effective malaria diagnostic technique."
CD011431,0,21608501,0,Oro-facial manifestations of Burkitt's lymphoma: an analysis of 680 cases from Malawi.,"Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive, fast growing, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and has one of the highest proliferation rates of any human tumour. There are three forms of BL: endemic or the African form (eBL), sporadic or non-endemic form (sBL) and the immunodeficiency-associated form in HIV-AIDS. The survival rate of a child with BL is dependent upon rapid diagnosis and treatment. The aim of the present study was to determine the oro-facial manifestations in children with BL in Malawi. It was carried out in two parts: the first, a retrospective record-based study (2005-2007) consisting of 661 cases of BL and the second, a prospective study (June 2008 -October 2009) documenting 19 cases of suspected and confirmed cases of BL. In the retrospective study, two thirds presented with BL at various sites of which the abdomen was the most common site. The 5-9 year age group predominated with an average peak incidence of 7 years and accounted for 60.0% of all the cases. There was a male preponderance with a ratio of male to female of 1.6:1. The maxilla was the most common site for oro-facial BL (13.7%) followed by the mandible (7.2%), cheeks (5.7%), maxilla and mandible (4.5%) and cervical lymph nodes (4.1%). Of the 397 with BL, 41.4% were tested for HIV and 37.97% were HIV-negative while 5% were HIV-positive. In the prospective study, females predominated with a male to female ratio of 1.1:1 and the mandible was the most common site accounting for 19.04%. The age group 5-9 years predominated with 68.4% relative frequency. Generally the trend of BL had decreased from 2005 to 2007 possibly due to better access to health services, increased use of bed-treated mosquito nets for malaria prevention and knowledgeable healthcare workers. All oral healthcare and other healthcare workers need to be educated on the oro-facial manifestations of BL for prompt referral and management. This would result in a better prognosis since BL is curable as it responds favourably to chemotherapy. Furthermore, communities need to be educated on the early signs and symptoms of BL and the importance of visiting a hospital as soon as possible."

Laboratory diagnosis is a very important factor for adequate treatment and management of malaria. In Honduras, malaria is diagnosed by both, microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests and to date, no molecular methods have been implemented for routine diagnosis. However, since mixed infections, and asymptomatic and low-parasitaemic cases are difficult to detect by light microscopy alone, identifying appropriate molecular tools for diagnostic applications in Honduras deserves further study. The present study investigated the utility of different molecular tests for the diagnosis of malaria in Honduras."

African-quin is a pragmatic multicentric study carried out in 13 African countries to evaluate non-conformities in the management and treatment of uncomplicated malarial attacks using quinine. This study involved a total of 3,981 patients with documented uncomplicated malarial attacks diagnosed by 500 clinical physicians. Physicians were supplied with quinine tablets (125 mg et 500 mg Quinimax containing 125 mg and 500 mg of quinine base respectively) to allow treatment according to the dose recommendations of the WHO (24 mg/kg/day of quinine base). In 38% of the 3,981 patients, diagnosis was based on clinical findings without measurement of parasitemia. The median dose of Quinimax was 15.4 mg/kg/day in 3 intakes in 67% and 2 intakes in 33%. The dose was 23.2 mg/kg/day for patients under 12 years and 14.7 mg/kg/day for patients over 18 years (p < 0.001). Treatment lasted for at least 5 days in 62% of patients. Fever control was achieved within a mean delay of 3.9 +/- 1.5 days and was followed by a rapid decrease in clinical symptoms. Clinical control (normal temperature) was obtained in 96% of patients. The dose of Quinimax was the same regardless of whether treatment was a success or failure. The results of this study demonstrate the gap between official recommendations and everyday clinical practice and raise several important questions concerning the basis for decision-making, treatment goals, drug dosage, and treatment duration."

Studies on a number of associated factors with malaria epidemics and the measures taken to respond to outbreaks are presented."
CD011431,0,8862600,0,"Sequence variation in the 18S rRNA gene, a target for PCR-based malaria diagnosis, in Plasmodium ovale from southern Vietnam.","Field surveys of malaria were performed in southern Vietnam by using an acridine orange staining method for rapid diagnosis and a PCR-based, microtiter plate hybridization method for accurate diagnosis. A total of three patients of Plasmodium ovale infection were detected, but PCR-amplified DNA of the P. ovale isolates from two of the patients did not hybridize with the P. ovale-specific probe. Analysis of the target sequence in the 18S rRNA gene indicated that in the DNA of isolates from both patients three nucleotides in the probe region from the typical P. ovale sequence were different, with deletions of two nucleotides and the substitution of one nucleotide. These results may suggest that in addition to molecular biological methods, careful microscopic examination of stained thin blood films is still required in studies of the prevalence of different malaria species."
CD011431,0,18390603,0,A magneto-optic route toward the in vivo diagnosis of malaria: preliminary results and preclinical trial data.,"We report the development of magneto-optic technology for the rapid quantitative diagnosis of malaria that may also be realizable in a noninvasive format. Hemozoin, the waste product of malarial parasitic action on hemoglobin, is produced in a form that under the action of an applied magnetic field gives rise to an induced optical dichroism characteristic of the hemozoin concentration. Here we show that precise measurement of this induced dichroism may be used to determine the level of malarial infection because this correlates, albeit in a complex manner throughout the infection cycle, with the concentration of hemozoin in the blood and tissues of infected patients. Under conservative assumptions for the production of hemozoin as a function of parasitemia, initial results indicate that the technique can match or exceed other current diagnostic techniques. The validity of the approach is confirmed by a small preliminary clinical trial on 13 patients, and measurements on live parasitized cells obtained from in vitro culture verify the possibility of producing in vivo diagnostic instrumentation."

We therefore examined specificity of malaria RDT products among patients infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense."
CD011431,0,22915610,0,Direct blood PCR in combination with nucleic acid lateral flow immunoassay for detection of Plasmodium species in settings where malaria is endemic.,"Declining malaria transmission and known difficulties with current diagnostic tools for malaria, such as microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in particular at low parasite densities, still warrant the search for sensitive diagnostic tests. Molecular tests need substantial simplification before implementation in clinical settings in countries where malaria is endemic. Direct blood PCR (db-PCR), circumventing DNA extraction, to detect Plasmodium was developed and adapted to be visualized by nucleic acid lateral flow immunoassay (NALFIA). The assay was evaluated in the laboratory against samples from confirmed Sudanese patients (n = 51), returning travelers (n = 214), samples from the Dutch Blood Bank (n = 100), and in the field in Burkina Faso (n = 283) and Thailand (n = 381) on suspected malaria cases and compared to RDT and microscopy. The sensitivity and specificity of db-PCR-NALFIA compared to the initial diagnosis in the laboratory were 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.909 to 0.969) and 97.4% (95% CI = 0.909 to 0.969), respectively. In Burkina Faso, the sensitivity was 94.8% (95% CI = 0.88.7 to 97.9%), and the specificity was 82.4% (95% CI = 75.4 to 87.7%) compared to microscopy and 93.3% (95% CI = 87.4 to 96.7%) and 91.4% (95% CI = 85.2 to 95.3%) compared to RDT. In Thailand, the sensitivity and specificity were 93.4% (CI = 86.4 to 97.1%) and 90.9 (95% CI = 86.7 to 93.9%), respectively, compared to microscopy and 95.6% (95% CI = 88.5 to 98.6%) and 87.1% (95% CI = 82.5 to 90.6) compared to RDT. db-PCR-NALFIA is highly sensitive and specific for easy and rapid detection of Plasmodium parasites and can be easily used in countries where malaria is endemic.

CD011431,0,12096003,0,Two novel assays for the detection of haemin-binding properties of antimalarials evaluated with compounds isolated from medicinal plants.,"Forty-two compounds isolated from nine plants used within South America for the treatment of malaria were tested for haemin binding using two novel, rapid screening methods. The data obtained were analysed with respect to IC(50) values for in vitro toxicity to Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites. One method, a multiwell assay based on the inhibition of the interaction of haemin with glutathione (GSH), is sensitive in the 10 microM range, takes c. 1 h and is suitable for either a high throughput screen or rapid assay during natural product isolation. Of 19 compounds showing antiplasmodial activity (IC(50) < 40 microM), 16 (84%) showed >40% inhibition of GSH-haemin reaction. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 0.85 and 0.82, respectively. The positive predictive value was 0.81 and the negative predictive value 0.86. A more sensitive assay (0.1 microM range) is based on the reversal by haemin-binding compounds of the haemin inhibition of the L-dopachrome-methyl ester tautomerase activity of human macrophage migration inhibitory factor. This assay gives a better idea of the affinity of interaction and uses very small amounts of test compound. The log[RI(50)] of eight of the compounds that tested positive in the above assays together with those of quinine and chloroquine showed a positive correlation with log[antiplasmodial IC(50)] for strain T9-96 (r = 0.824) and strain K1 (r = 0.904).

CD011431,0,21851625,0,Socially-marketed rapid diagnostic tests and ACT in the private sector: ten years of experience in Cambodia.,"Whilst some populations have recently experienced dramatic declines in malaria, the majority of those most at risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria still lack access to effective treatment with artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) and others are already facing parasites resistant to artemisinins.In this context, there is a crucial need to improve both access to and targeting of ACT through greater availability of good quality ACT and parasitological diagnosis. This is an issue of increasing urgency notably in the private commercial sector, which, in many countries, plays an important role in the provision of malaria treatment. The Affordable Medicines Facility for malaria (AMFm) is a recent initiative that aims to increase the provision of affordable ACT in public, private and NGO sectors through a manufacturer-level subsidy. However, to date, there is little documented experience in the programmatic implementation of subsidized ACT in the private sector. Cambodia is in the unique position of having more than 10 years of experience not only in implementing subsidized ACT, but also rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) as part of a nationwide social marketing programme. The programme includes behaviour change communication and the training of private providers as well as the sale and distribution of Malarine, the recommended ACT, and Malacheck, the RDT. This paper describes and evaluates this experience by drawing on the results of household and provider surveys conducted since the start of the programme. The available evidence suggests that providers' and consumers' awareness of Malarine increased rapidly, but that of Malacheck much less so. In addition, improvements in ACT and RDT availability and uptake were relatively slow, particularly in more remote areas.The lack of standardization in the survey methods and the gaps in the data highlight the importance of establishing a clear system for monitoring and evaluation for similar initiatives. Despite these limitations, a number of important lessons can still be learnt. These include the importance of a comprehensive communications strategy and of a sustained and reliable supply of products, with attention to the geographical reach of both. Other important challenges relate to the difficulty in incentivising providers and consumers not only to choose the recommended drug, but to precede this with a confirmatory blood test and ensure that providers adhere to the test results and patients to the treatment regime. In Cambodia, this is particularly complicated due to problems inherent to the drug itself and the emergence of artemisinin resistance."
CD011431,0,15159369,0,Malaria.,"Malaria is a parasitic infection of global importance. Although relatively uncommon in developed countries, where the disease occurs mainly in travellers who have returned from endemic regions, it remains one of the most prevalent infections of humans worldwide. In endemic regions, malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and creates enormous social and economic burdens. Current efforts to control malaria focus on reducing attributable morbidity and mortality. Targeted chemoprophylaxis and use of insecticide-treated bed nets have been successful in some endemic areas. For travellers to malaria-endemic regions, personal protective measures and appropriate chemoprophylaxis can significantly reduce the risk of infection. Prompt evaluation of the febrile traveller, a high degree of suspicion of malaria, rapid and accurate diagnosis, and appropriate antimalarial therapy are essential in order to optimize clinical outcomes of infected patients. Additional approaches to malaria control, including genetic manipulation of mosquitoes and malaria vaccines, are areas of ongoing research."

CD011431,0,14742196,0,Genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum pyrimethamine resistance by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.,"Increasing resistance, recrudescences, and treatment failure have led to the replacement of chloroquine with the combination of pyrimethamine (PYR) and sulfadoxine (SDX) as the first-line antimalarial drugs for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in several areas where this disease is endemic. The development of resistance to PYR-SDX is favored by incomplete treatment courses or by subtherapeutic levels in plasma. PYR-SDX resistance has been associated with several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and the P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthetase (pfdhps) genes. We have established assays based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) that conveniently allow the identification of SNPs associated with PYR resistance. Variants occurring at codon positions 16, 51, 59, and 108 of the pfdhfr gene were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS in synthetic oligonucleotides to determine the detection threshold. In addition, 63 blood samples from subjects with P. falciparum parasitemia of various degrees were analyzed. The results were compared to those obtained by DNA sequencing of the respective gene fragment. The results of MALDI-TOF MS and DNA sequencing were consistent in 40 samples. In 23 samples two or three pfdhfr variants were detected by MALDI-TOF assays, whereas DNA-sequencing revealed one variant only. Simultaneous detection of two different mutations by biplex assays was, in principle, feasible. As demonstrated by the example of PYR resistance, MALDI-TOF MS allows for rapid and automated high-throughput assessment of drug sensitivity in P. falciparum malaria."

The 241 subjects were international travellers or immigrants from areas where malaria is endemic. When compared with the microscopical examination of bloodsmears (used as the 'gold standard'), the dipsticks were found to be 94.4% sensitive and 94.5% specific for pure infections with P. falciparum. The performance of the tests when used on patients infected with species other than P. falciparum or more than one Plasmodium spp. showed a high degree of variability. Although the dipsticks represent a very simple, rapid, and valuable diagnostic aid, they should not be considered a complete substitute for direct microscopical diagnosis using stained bloodsmears."

CD011431,0,18593340,0,Prevalence and pattern of cross-reacting antibodies to HIV in patients with tuberculosis.,"In many countries, HIV testing among tuberculosis (TB) patients is recommended so that both infections are appropriately treated. Cross-reacting antibodies to HIV antigens have been reported for several conditions, including TB, leprosy, malaria, and rheumatoid arthritis. To study the pattern and prevalence of cross-reacting antibodies to HIV antigens, we examined sera from 153 HIV-negative TB patients and 40 healthy individuals in Chennai, south India. We also studied the differences in cross-reactivity of various HIV antigens using two different Western blot kits. Of the 153 samples studied, 80 were tested using HIV Western blot and 73 were tested using INNOLIA. Most patients in the study had concordantly negative ELISA and rapid tests, and no subject had a positive Western blot. However, seven TB patients had antibodies that cross-reacted with HIV antigens, giving rise to an indeterminate result. While p51/55 was the most frequently recognized antigen in the Western blot assay, antibodies to sgp120 was most frequently identified in INNOLIA. Sequence similarities between the two organisms could be responsible for eliciting cross-reacting antibodies, since a few related epitopes were identified in HIV and Mycobacterium. These findings could have potential implications for the development of diagnostics and vaccines."

Malaria is diagnosed predominantly by using clinical criteria, with microscopy as the current gold standard for detecting parasitemia, even though it is clearly inadequate in many health care settings. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been recognized as an ideal method for diagnosing infectious diseases, including malaria, in recent years. There have been a number of RDTs developed and evaluated widely for malaria diagnosis, but a number of issues related to these products have arisen. This review highlights RDTs, including challenges in assessing their performance, internationally available RDTs, their effectiveness in various health care settings, and the selection of RDTs for different health care systems."

Widespread deficiencies have been reported in the prescribing and counselling practices of health care providers treating febrile patients in both public and private health facilities. Cameroon is no exception with low levels of adherence to national guidelines, the frequent selection of non-recommended antimalarials and the use of incorrect dosages. This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introducing two different provider training packages, alongside rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), designed to equip providers with the knowledge and practical skills needed to effectively diagnose and treat febrile patients. The overall aim is to target antimalarial treatment better and to facilitate optimal use of malaria treatment guidelines."

In developing countries, the empirical treatment of NMAUFs with antimalarial drugs continues even in the era of highly specific rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria. We carried out a retrospective review of patients with fever admitted to a rural teaching hospital in central India. We categorized patients with NMAUF into different clinical syndromes and determined their demographic profile, inhospital course, and the pattern of antimalarial use. The study sample included 1,197 adult patients who were investigated for malaria; 1,053 (88%) of them had NMAUF, and use of further diagnostics in this group was limited. Despite one or more negative tests for malaria, many patients (39.9%, 95% CI 37.0-43.3) received antimalarial drugs. These results suggest a need for guidelines and training to improve empirical treatment of NMAUF."

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerful tool in pharmaceutical forensics, and we tested this technique for discriminating between counterfeit and genuine artesunate antimalarial tablets. Using NIRS, we found that artesunate tablets could be identified as genuine or counterfeit with high accuracy. Multivariate classification models indicated that this discriminatory ability was based, at least partly, on the presence or absence of spectral signatures related to artesunate. This technique can be field-portable and requires little training after calibrations are developed, thus showing great promise for rapid and accurate fake detection."

The official figure of 1.5 million cases annually is a gross under-estimation of the true incidence and the actual figures are estimated to be 10-100 times higher. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) directorate is the main body responsible for malaria control in India. Newer strategies including insecticide treated bednets, longlasting insecticidal bednets and rapid diagnostic tests have been used for malaria control in the last decade. Global assistance has come from the World Bank and Global fund in the form of Enhanced Malaria Control Programme(EMCP) and Intensified Malaria Control Programme(IMCP) respectively. Despite years of concerted global and national efforts, control of malaria continues to be a challenge. The emergence of drug resistance to anti-malarial drugs has been a major hurdle in its control.

Additionally, the device served as a heating block for the DNA preparation. We refer this method as LAMP-Tube scanner, and evaluated using 209 microscopically positive malaria samples and compared them to RDTs and LAMP-Thermocycler. Two most common human infecting Plasmodium species were detected. The LAMP-Tube scanner method is found to be simple and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification. The time to amplification varied but was closely less than 60 min. Sensitivity and specificity of LAMP-Tube scanner in detecting Plasmodium falciparum were 95% and 93.3%, compared to microscopy and 98.3% and 100% respectively, compared to standard LAMP-Thermocycler. In addition, it showed a detection limit of 10 and 40 copies of the parasitemia for Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum. Accordingly, in comparison to the results obtained by microscopy, the LAMP-Tube scanner had a less divergence in sensitivity and specificity, and yielded results similar to those of LAMP-Thermocycler. This method has the great potential as a field usable molecular tool for the diagnosis of malaria and is an alternative to conventional PCR-based diagnostic methods for field use."

Data were collected between March 4 and April 9, 2010 by mobile medical teams. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were used for case confirmation. A convenience sample of 1,629 consecutive suspected malaria patients was included. Of these patients, 1,564 (96%) patients had malaria RDTs performed, and 317 (20.3%) patients were positive. Of the 317 case-patients with a positive RDT, 278 (87.7%) received chloroquine, 8 (2.5%) received quinine, and 31 (9.8%) had no antimalarial treatment recorded. Our experience shows that mobile medical teams trained in the use of malaria RDTs had a high rate of testing suspected malaria cases and that the majority of patients with positive RDTs received appropriate antimalarial treatment. Malaria RDTs were useful in the post-disaster setting where logistical and technical constraints limited the use of microscopy."
CD011431,0,23732448,0,[Malaria and children who travel - prophylaxis and therapy].,"Children account for between 15 - 20 % of all imported malaria cases worldwide. Immigrant children visiting their families in the country of origin in sub-Saharan Africa are at highest risk. Prevention of malaria in children who travel to endemic areas is guided by the ABCD principles - Awareness of risk, Bite prevention, Chemoprophylaxis for high risk areas and rapid Diagnosis and treatment when malaria is suspected. The use of anti-malarial medication in small children is hampered by a paucity of dosage, pharmcokinetic and tolerability data. In the pre-travel consultation parents should be provided with practical advice on anti-mosquito measures, exact, (weight-based) dosages of chemoprophylaxis medication and/or stand-by treatment as indicated. A paediatric formulation is available for daily atovaquone-proguanil chemoprophylaxis (children > 11 kg) and mefloquine is a cost-effective, once weekly prophylaxis that is useful for children > 5 kg who travel for longer periods. The bitter taste of mefloquine should be disguised to increase adherence. When a Stand-by Emergency Treatment (SBET) is indicated, artemether-lumefantrine cherry flavoured dispersible tablets are a good choice for small children. Post-travel to endemic areas, malaria should always be suspected if a child becomes ill. Paediatric malaria is an emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment."
CD011431,0,21087378,1,Genetic variability in Plasmodium vivax aldolase gene in Korean isolates and the sensitivity of the Binax Now malaria test.,"Introduction of rapid malaria diagnostic tests (RDT) initiated numerous field evaluations in various epidemiologic settings. But the efficiency of some RTD kits based on aldolase raised reservations for direct implementation of RDT into clinical settings. We performed Binax Now malaria test in 84 Korean Plasmodium vivax isolates and compared it with the traditional Giemsa stain microscopy test as the reference standard. The sensitivity of Binax Now was 62.0% for P. vivax cases (52/84, 95% CI 51.2-71.6%) with 100.0% specificity (50/50, 95% confidence interval 92.9-100%). After the aldolase gene sequence analysis of 84 isolates, two synonymous mutations in aldolase gene were identified in both Binax Now positive and negative samples. No significant association between the mutations and Binax Now malaria tests was found. Thus, the genetic variability would not explain the poor performance of P. vivax RDTs by detecting aldolase in ROK isolates."

Here we demonstrate that known point mutations in dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase can be scored quickly and accurately by single-nucleotide primer extension and detection of florescent products on a capillary sequencer. We use this method to genotype parasites in natural infections from the Thai-Myanmar border. This approach could greatly simplify large-scale screening of resistance mutations of the type required for evaluating and updating antimalarial drug treatment policies. The method can be easily adapted to other P. falciparum genes and will greatly simplify scoring of point mutations in this and other parasitic organisms."

CD011431,0,17049572,0,Minimising human error in malaria rapid diagnosis: clarity of written instructions and health worker performance.,"The usefulness of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) in malaria case management depends on the accuracy of the diagnoses they provide. Despite their apparent simplicity, previous studies indicate that RDT accuracy is highly user-dependent. As malaria RDTs will frequently be used in remote areas with little supervision or support, minimising mistakes is crucial. This paper describes the development of new instructions (job aids) to improve health worker performance, based on observations of common errors made by remote health workers and villagers in preparing and interpreting RDTs, in the Philippines and Laos. Initial preparation using the instructions provided by the manufacturer was poor, but improved significantly with the job aids (e.g. correct use both of the dipstick and cassette increased in the Philippines by 17%). However, mistakes in preparation remained commonplace, especially for dipstick RDTs, as did mistakes in interpretation of results. A short orientation on correct use and interpretation further improved accuracy, from 70% to 80%. The results indicate that apparently simple diagnostic tests can be poorly performed and interpreted, but provision of clear, simple instructions can reduce these errors. Preparation of appropriate instructions and training as well as monitoring of user behaviour are an essential part of rapid test implementation."
CD011431,0,10203469,1,Detection and species determination of malaria parasites by PCR: comparison with microscopy and with ParaSight-F and ICT malaria Pf tests in a clinical environment.,"A rapid procedure for the diagnosis of malaria infections directly from dried blood spots by PCR amplification was evaluated with samples from 52 patients. Plasmodium infections were identified with a genus-specific primer set, and species differentiation between Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was analyzed by multiplex PCR. The PCR test with any of the three primer sets was able to detect as few as four parasites per microliter by gel electrophoresis or by nonisotopic paper hybridization chromatography. The diagnoses obtained by PCR correlated closely with those obtained by Giemsa staining except for two samples observed to have mixed P. falciparum-P. vivax infections. These were initially missed by microscopic analysis. In comparison with antigen-capture assays for P. falciparum, the PCR assays were able to detect three infections that were missed by the ParaSight-F test. The PCR test was negative for nine ParaSight-F-positive samples and one ICT Malaria Pf-positive sample, and these were confirmed to be false-positive results. The PCR thus gave no false-negative or false-positive results. Patients undergoing antimalarial therapy were also monitored by the PCR assay. Four of seven patients who were PCR positive for P. vivax at the time of discharge were later readmitted to the hospital with a recurrence of P. vivax infection. We would like to propose that PCR is a sensitive and easy method that can serve as a useful addition to microscopy for the diagnosis and the clinical monitoring of treatment of malaria."

The objective of this report was to review scientific data from studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa on the diagnosis of malaria in pregnancy within the last two decades (1987 to 2007), to highlight the challenges and the public health implications. Using the Medline Entrez-Pubmed search, relevant publications were identified for the review via combinations of key words such as Malaria, Pregnancy, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which yielded 777 entries as of September 2007. The results from the various studies were discordant, due to differences in the techniques of sample collection and analysis, based on the differences in the definition of clinical, peripheral, and placental malaria. Definitions were based on the presence of malaria parasite and/or pigments in blood smear from peripheral/placental blood, on histological placental findings, on the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nonspecific clinical presentation of malaria, lack of efficient diagnostic facilities and trained personnel, and absence of regulatory standards for diagnostic tests, are some of the major diagnostic challenges. Increased allocation of resources to development and application of accurate diagnostics will improve malaria diagnosis in pregnancy."

The sensitivity and specificity of AO method compared to the gold standard (GS) method were 94.1% and 100% respectively. At parasite count below 5,000 per microlitre of blood, the sensitivity of AO method decreased to 90.2% but the difference was not statistically significant. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 94.1% respectively at all levels of parasite count. The mean duration to get results of malaria parasite diagnosis by GS and AO methods were 35 and 5 minutes respectively. The limitation of the AO method was frequent blowing of the fluorescence microscope bulb. It is concluded that if the bulb system of the fluorescence microscope can be improved, the AO method could be included among other methods for the detection of malaria parasites in clinical settings."
CD011431,0,19263088,0,Malaria morbidity and temperature variation in a low risk Kenyan district: a case of overdiagnosis?,"Diagnosis of malaria using only clinical means leads to overdiagnosis. This has implications due to safety concerns and the recent introduction of more expensive drugs. Temperature is a major climatic factor influencing the transmission dynamics of malaria. This study looked at trends in malaria morbidity in the low risk Kenyan district of Nyandarua, coupled with data on temperature and precipitation for the years 2003-2006. July had the highest number of cases (12.2% of all cases) followed by August (10.2% of all cases). July and August also had the lowest mean maximum temperatures, 20.1 and 20.2 degrees C respectively. April, July and August had the highest rainfall, with daily means of 4.0, 4.3 and 4.9 mm, respectively. Observation showed that the coldest months experienced the highest number of cases of malaria. Despite the high rainfall, transmission of malaria tends to be limited by low temperatures due to the long duration required for sporogony, with fewer vectors surviving. These cold months also tend to have the highest number of cases of respiratory infections. There is a possibility that some of these were misdiagnosed as malaria based on the fact that only a small proportion of malaria cases were diagnosed using microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. We conclude that overdiagnosis may be prevalent in this district and there may be a need to design an intervention to minimise it."

Indigenous diagnostic kits for the detection of various infections such as filariasis, typhoid, amebiasis, Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis, HIV, dengue, leishmaniasis, malaria, rabies, toxoplasmosis, rotavirus, and group A streptococci have been developed. Agreements to transfer the know-how of some of these leads to industries have been signed. The know-how of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of hepatitis C has been successfully transferred to industry and is being commercially produced. For detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2, indigenous diagnostic kits based on three different formats, namely ELISA, Western blot and rapid test have been developed and are being commercially produced by Indian industries. The factors influencing the successful transfer of laboratory-scale diagnostic assays from academia to industry and their commercial exploitation have been discussed. Indian scientists have made seminal contributions in exploring the possibility to develop an effective and safe contraceptive vaccine to control the increasing human population of India. Achieving contraception by means of vaccine is a novel approach, which entails generation of a specific antibody response against antigens critically involved in the process of mammalian reproduction. In India, three major programs on contraceptive vaccines based on the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin ((beta)hCG) for women, ovine follicle stimulating hormone (oFSH) for men, and riboflavin carrier protein for both males and females have been initiated. The work at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi on contraceptive vaccine for women, based on (beta)hCG, has demonstrated, for the first time, that it is feasible to regulate fertility by such an approach. Basic research being carried out to achieve immunocontraception by interfering at sperm-oocyte interaction level has been briefly discussed. These developments are still at the research stage. In addition to advances in the area of contraceptive vaccines, a non-steroidal contraceptive oral pill has been developed by Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, commercially produced by two Indian pharmaceutical companies and has been incorporated in the National Family Welfare Program. Another interesting approach for fertility regulation in male has been developed in India, which involves vas occlusion with styrene maleic anhydride (SMA) and is currently undergoing clinical trials in human subjects."

CD011431,0,20930074,0,Importance of nonenteric protozoan infections in immunocompromised people.,"There are many neglected nonenteric protozoa able to cause serious morbidity and mortality in humans, particularly in the developing world. Diseases caused by certain protozoa are often more severe in the presence of HIV. While information regarding neglected tropical diseases caused by trypanosomatids and Plasmodium is abundant, these protozoa are often not a first consideration in Western countries where they are not endemic. As such, diagnostics may not be available in these regions. Due to global travel and immigration, this has become an increasing problem. Inversely, in certain parts of the world (particularly sub-Saharan Africa), the HIV problem is so severe that diseases like microsporidiosis and toxoplasmosis are common. In Western countries, due to the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), these diseases are infrequently encountered. While free-living amoebae are rarely encountered in a clinical setting, when infections do occur, they are often fatal. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential to the survival of patients infected with these organisms. This paper reviews information on the diagnosis and treatment of nonenteric protozoal diseases in immunocompromised people, with a focus on patients infected with HIV. The nonenteric microsporidia, some trypanosomatids, Toxoplasma spp., Neospora spp., some free-living amoebae, Plasmodium spp., and Babesia spp. are discussed."

This complication increases the risk for postoperative wound infection and adds to the burden of trauma. The aims of the present study were to investigate the preventive effect of early antimalaria treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infected trauma patients, and to study the validity and accuracy of a rapid test to identify those infected. An open, non-randomized, interventional multi-center, cohort study was carried out at six district hospitals in northwestern Cambodia. Two hundred twenty-two trauma patients was examined for P. falciparum by dipstick test soon after injury. The patients testing positive were immediately treated with artesunate-mefloquine. A subset of 108 patients from Pailin, an area considered highly endemic for falciparum malaria, was used for the main analysis. Of 28 P. falciparum rapid test-positives, 21 developed symptomatic postinjury malaria despite early antimalarial treatment. The agreement between the dipstick test and blood smear examination was good (kappa 92.5; 95% CI 84.5-100). Early pre-operative treatment of parasite carriers does not seem to prevent symptomatic malaria after injury and surgery. The rapid test for falciparum malaria was reliable in early identification of asymptomatic P. falciparum infected patients."

CD011431,0,10900908,0,[The goals and tasks of the Roll Back Malaria WHO Cabinet Project].,"WHO's Roll Back Malaria Cabinet Project (RBM) has been initiated by WHO Director-General Dr. G. Brundtland in 1998. The World Health Organization, The United Nation's Children's Fund, the United Nation's Development Programme and World Bank have joined forces to fight malaria, which kills more than one million people a year. RBM is being launched at time of growing and investment in malaria, which still remains grossly underfunded. RBM is different from previous efforts to fight malaria. The project is working not only through new tools for controlling the disease but also by involving and strengthening the health services to affected population. This pattern of activities is close to Russian version of malaria eradication programme that had been carried out with the success in the former Soviet Union in the 1950s. RBM seeks to reduce substantially the human suffering and economic losses due one of the most costly diseases. Malaria causes an estimated 300 to 500 million acute cases per year. Malaria is a disease of young and the poor, many of them children who live with no easy access to health service. RBM goal is a significant reduction--ideally halving within ten years--in the global burden of disease associated with malaria. RBM purpose is to create an environment that helps countries develop policies and implement relevant elements of RBM strategy. There are six elements to roll back malaria. They are: early detection of malaria illness; rapid treatment of those who are ill; multiple means for preventing infection; strengthening of health sector and intersectoral activities; a powerful sustained social involvement and movement; focused research for new tools and better implementation. New tools are available to combat malaria. They include among others: rapid diagnostics; new drugs (artesunates) and new means for delivery; impregnated bednets; new means for predicting epidemics (satellite mapping). WHO will be coordinating the RBM project. Endemic countries and affected populations have identified malaria as a priority health issue. Activities will cut across WHO programmes and regions to support government, to improve technical efficiency and capacity, to optimize resource allocation, utilization and mobilization."
CD011431,0,18160449,1,Rapid diagnosis of vivax malaria by the SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test when thrombocytopenia is present.,"An easy and reliable diagnostic method for malaria is highly desirable. We examined the recently introduced SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test, which detects Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase, with the additional aid of the presence or absence of thrombocytopenia to diagnose vivax malaria. We enrolled 732 patients with clinically suspected malaria in an area where vivax malaria is endemic. We performed microscopic examination of thin film, applied the SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test, and checked platelet counts. One hundred ninety-five patients were smear positive for vivax malaria. The sensitivity of the SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test was 96.4%, and its specificity was 98.9%. We found that 95.4% of malaria patients had thrombocytopenia, and the proportion with malaria increased as platelet counts decreased. A positive SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test when thrombocytopenia was present showed a 100% positive predictive value for vivax malaria. In conclusion, the SD Bioline Malaria Antigen test is a rapid and accurate diagnostic method for vivax malaria, and a platelet count can facilitate a rapid diagnosis of malaria."
CD011431,0,10561760,1,A comparison of antigen dipstick assays with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and blood film examination in the rapid diagnosis of malaria.,"Early diagnosis of malaria for military personnel training in the field is crucial in providing proper treatment for the infected and in taking appropriate preventive measures for the non-infected. Present preliminary diagnosis of malaria in the field depends on the clinical symptoms of the patients and there is a need for rapid diagnosis of malaria in the field. The presence of drug-resistant strains of the Plasmodium species in the region also increases the urgency of finding a quick and sensitive way of identifying the different strains. This study evaluated current methods available for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The dipstick assays, the ParaSight F test and the OptiMAL malaria rapid test were compared with the methods of microscopic examination of blood film and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On comparison to the blood film and PCR methods, the ParaSight F test has specificity of 98.6% and sensitivity of 91% for P. falciparum detection. The OptiMAL malaria rapid test has a specificity of 100% and 98.6% and sensitivity of 92.8% and 92.6% for P. vivax and P. falciparum detection respectively. We conclude that both tests are suitable for use for rapid malaria diagnosis in the field but the OptiMAL rapid malaria test, which can detect both vivax and falciparum malaria, would be more useful."

CD011431,0,18513771,1,Point-of-care testing for malaria outbreak management.,"A rapid antigen assay for malaria was performed on blood samples collected during a simultaneous outbreak of falciparum malaria and vivax malaria on a remote island in the Indonesian archipelago. During the outbreak, a total of 89 patients (4.3% of the population) were diagnosed with malaria within a week. Microscopic examination revealed 78 malaria slide-positive cases, of whom 49 (62.8%) were identified as P. falciparum, 7 (9.0%) as P. vivax and 22 (28.2%) as mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax infections. The rapid malaria assay showed excellent correlation with expert-confirmed routine microscopy for P. falciparum and P. vivax monoinfections and mixed infections with a parasite density >50 parasites/microl. Several slide-negative blood samples collected from febrile patients with clinical malaria tested positive in the rapid test. The estimated sensitivity calculated for the rapid test (91.0%) was slightly higher than that of microscopy (87.6%). The result indicates that rapid antigen detection for malaria could be a useful alternative to microscopy to reduce the workload during emergency outbreak situations."

This study included 1,064 patients admitted with malaria to study thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000 /cumm) in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) mono infection and mixed infection (Pf + Pv). The species diagnosis was done by peripheral blood film (PBF) and rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Validation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done only in patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20,000 /cumm). The breakup of patients was 525 (49.34%) Pf, 460 (43.23%) Pv and 79 (7.42%) mixed malaria (Pf + Pv). Thrombocytopenia was observed in 24.6% (262/1064) patients. The risk was greatest in the mixed infections in comparison to monoinfection individually (43.04% [34/79]; mixed vs Pv monoinfection: Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.675 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.029-2.726], p < 0.0366; mixed vs Pf monoinfection: OR=3.911 [95% CI 2.367-6.463], p < 0.0001). Pv monoinfection (31.09% [143/460]) had greater risk compared to Pf monoinfection (16.19% [85/525]; OR = 2.335 [95% CI 1.722-3.167], p < 0.0001). The occurrence of severe thrombocytopenia was also higher in Pv monoinfection (18.18% [26/143]) in comparison to either Pf monoinfection (10.59% [9/85], OR = 1.877 (95% CI 0.834-4.223)) or mixed infection (11.76% [4/34]; OR = 1.667 (95% CI 0.540-5.142) but this association was statistically not significant. Six patients (3 Pv, 2 Pf and 1 mixed) developed severe epistaxis requiring platelet transfusion. There was no relation between parasite density and platelet count as many patients with severe thrombocytopenia had parasite density similar to patients without thrombocytopenia. We found that the association of thrombocytopenia was statistically more significant with P. vivax monoinfection as compared to P. falciparum."

The sensitivity and specificity of an HRP-2 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (ICT Malaria Pf((R))) compared to microscopy, as well as factors associated with discordant diagnostic results are also presented. P. falciparum infection prevalence was estimated at 7.0% (95% CI 4.9-9.0%) using microscopy. Using microscopy as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the HRP-2 RDT was 100% and specificity was 91.5%; positive predictive value was estimated to be 46.7% (95% CI 36.3-57.4%). RDT discordance, or HRP-2 false positivity, was highest among older children, those in the northern part of Luangwa District, and those with a reported history of antimalarial treatment. These data suggest microscopy should remain the gold standard for estimating malaria parasite point prevalence from household surveys for monitoring and evaluation purposes."

For the rapid test, OptiMAL commercial kits were used. The results were also evaluated with clinical findings from patients. The parasites were determined by microscopic examination of thick-blood films from 81 patients with vivax malaria from southeastern Anatolia, Turkey. The OptiMAL test results were found to be negative in five patients who were diagnosed clinically and through thick-film testing as having vivax malaria. There was no false positivity observed with the OptiMAL test.

Rapid detection of Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) in saliva samples from 130 of 144 children with microscopically confirmed P. falciparum infection was evaluated using Optimal-IT dipsticks. Genotyping of parasites was also performed in saliva and blood samples from a cohort of patients by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sensitivity of the dipstick in whole-blood, whole-saliva, or supernatant of spun saliva samples was 97.2%, 77.9%, and 48.4%, respectively. The sensitivity of the dipstick in whole-saliva samples was significantly higher than in supernatant of spun saliva samples (P < 0.0005). Mutant T76 allele was detectable in 60% and 57% of blood and saliva samples, respectively. This finding shows rapid detection of pLDH in patient saliva."

DNA extraction for LAMP was conducted by conventional methods or simple heating of the sample; test results were either assessed visually or by gel electrophoresis. Conventional DNA extraction followed by gel electrophoresis had the highest agreement with the reference method (81.7%, kappa = 0.64), with a sensitivity (95% CI) of 76.1% (68.3-83.9%), comparable to RDT and microscopy, but a specificity of 89.6% (84.0-95.2%) compared with 100% for RDT and microscopy. DNA extraction by heat treatment deteriorated specificity to unacceptable levels. LAMP enables molecular diagnosis of falciparum malaria in settings with limited technical resources but will need further optimization.

The sensitivity of ICT in 2,343 patients tested in our services was 100% and the specificity 99.74%. Moreover, two patients with a positive ICT would initially have been missed by expert microscopy, with Plasmodium falciparum malaria being confirmed microscopically some hours later. The principal reasons for the better performance of the test in our series appear to be blood collection in EDTA vials and considerable experience with handling and interpreting the ICT test."

Here we propose an approach to diagnosing the presence and drug-susceptibility of infectious diseases based on direct detection of RNA from clinical samples. We demonstrate that species-specific RNA signatures can be used to identify a broad spectrum of infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, yeast, and parasites. Moreover, we show that the behavior of a small set of bacterial transcripts after a brief antibiotic pulse can rapidly differentiate drug-susceptible and -resistant organisms and that these measurements can be made directly from clinical materials. Thus, transcriptional signatures could form the basis of a uniform diagnostic platform applicable across a broad range of infectious agents."

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer great potential to address this need. Reports of significant variation in the field performance of RDTs based on the detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) (PfHRP2) and of significant sequence polymorphism in PfHRP2 led us to evaluate the binding of four HRP2-specific monoclonal antibodies (MABs) to parasite proteins from geographically distinct P. falciparum isolates, define the epitopes recognized by these MABs, and relate the copy number of the epitopes to MAB reactivity. We observed a significant difference in the reactivity of the same MAB to different isolates and between different MABs tested with single isolates. When the target epitopes of three of the MABs were determined and mapped onto the peptide sequences of the field isolates, significant variability in the frequency of these epitopes was observed. These findings support the role of sequence variation as an explanation for variations in the performance of HRP2-based RDTs and point toward possible approaches to improve their diagnostic sensitivities."
CD011431,0,22702318,0,Standby emergency treatment of malaria in travelers: experience to date and new developments.,"The concept of 'standby emergency treatment' (SBET) describes the strategy where travelers carry an emergency malaria treatment for self-administration when no medical attention is available or for use under medical supervision after a confirmed malaria diagnosis, and raises many issues for discussion. International guidelines vary on the topic, and there is controversy regarding the appropriate niche for this imperfect strategy. There are situations when SBET can supplement chemoprophylaxis with mosquito bite prevention and for some travelers, particularly those visiting minimal malaria risk areas, carriage of SBET and concomitant anti-mosquito bite measures can constitute the main antimalaria strategy. A strong argument in support of equipping travelers with a quality effective antimalarial treatment as part of their travel medical kit is the global proliferation of counterfeit antimalarials, a situation that is increasing in Africa but is especially prevalent in Asia where more than 50% of artemisinin products are fake. New developments such as improved rapid malaria tests and their wider distribution together with the availability of effective, well-tolerated malaria treatments, such as atovaquone/proguanil, artemether/lumefantrine and a new artemisinin combination dihydroartemisin/piperaquine, which is licensed in Europe for uncomplicated malaria, suggest that it is time to revisit and re-evaluate this strategy for travelers."

The aim of this study is to explore the epidemiological and clinical features of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in United Nations personnel stationed in this area. From July 2006 to June 2009, epidemiological data and medical records of 678 patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria at the U.N. level 2 hospital were analyzed. The U.N. personnel were divided into individuals not immune to Plasmodium falciparum and individuals semi-immune to Plasmodium falciparum. The patients were divided into a chemoprophylaxis group (non-immune individuals who complied with the chemoprophylaxis regimen, 582 cases) and a no/incomplete chemoprophylaxis group (non-immune individuals who either did not fully comply with chemoprophylaxis or did not use it at all and semi-immune individuals who did not use chemoprophylaxis, 96 cases). Overall morbidity was about 11.3%. There was a significant difference in the morbidity of semi-immune and non-immune individuals (1.3% vs. 15.1%, P<0.001). Out of the total, 82.9% of cases occurred during the rainy season. The incidence of fever in the chemoprophylaxis group was significantly lower than in the no/incomplete chemoprophylaxis group (36.8% vs. 96.9%, P<0.001). Significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to all other malaria-like symptoms except gastrointestinal symptoms, serum glucose level, platelet count, and alanine aminotransferase level. The incidence of complications was 1.2% (chemoprophylaxis group) and 44.8% (no/incomplete chemoprophylaxis group).The most common complication was thrombocytopenia, which was seen in 40.6% of the no/incomplete chemoprophylaxis group. In summary, Plasmodium falciparum malaria mainly occurred in rainy season. Gastrointestinal symptoms are an important precursor of malaria. Blood smears and rapid diagnostic tests should be performed after the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. Appropriate chemoprophylaxis is necessary for reducing the severity of malaria."
CD011431,0,10449488,0,Detection of the Plasmodium falciparum antigen histidine-rich protein 2 in blood of pregnant women: implications for diagnosing placental malaria.,"Pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to infection by Plasmodium falciparum. Parasites may be present in the placenta yet not detectable in peripheral blood smears by routine light microscopy. In order to determine how frequently misdiagnosis occurs, peripheral blood and placental samples were collected from 1,077 Cameroonian women at the time of giving birth and examined for the presence of malarial parasites by using light microscopy. Results showed that 20.1% of the women who had placental malaria were peripheral blood smear negative. Thus, malarial infection was not detected by microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears from approximately one out of five malaria-infected women. Since P. falciparum parasites secrete histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2), we sought to determine if detecting HRP-2 in either peripheral plasma or whole blood might be used to diagnose the presence of parasites ""hidden"" in the placenta. Samples of peripheral plasma from 127 women with different levels of placental malarial infection were assayed by HRP-2-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HRP-2 was detected in 88% of the women with placental malaria who tested negative by blood smear. Additionally, whole blood was obtained from 181 women and tested for HRP-2 with a rapid, chromatographic strip test (ICT). The ICT test accurately detected malarial infection in 89.1% of P. falciparum-infected women. Furthermore, 94% of women with malaria were accurately diagnosed by using a combination of microscopy and the ICT test. Thus, detection of HRP-2 in conjunction with microscopy should improve diagnosis of malaria in pregnant women."

To assess the ability of health systems to maintain RDTs within manufacturers' specifications, we monitored temperatures in the delivery chain from manufacturer through to the village health worker in Cambodia and the Philippines. In both countries, storage temperatures regularly exceeded those recommended for most RDTs intended for field use, whereas temperatures during transport greatly exceeded the lower and upper limits. These results emphasize the need for good logistical planning during the introduction of point-of-care tests in tropical countries and the importance of considering the stability of diagnostic tests during procurement."
CD011431,0,12167093,0,The economic payoffs of integrated malaria control in the Zambian copperbelt between 1930 and 1950.,"It has long been suggested that malaria is delaying the economic development of countries that are most severely affected by the disease. Several studies have documented the economic consequences of malaria at the household level, primarily in communities engaged in subsistence farming. A missing element is the appraisal of the economic impact of malaria on the industrial and service sectors that will probably become the backbone of many developing economies. We estimate the economic effects of integrated malaria control implemented during the colonial period and sustained for 20 years in four copper mining communities of the former Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). Integrated malaria control was characterized by strong emphasis on environmental management, while part of the mining communities also benefited from rapid diagnosis and treatment and the use of bednets. The programmes were highly successful as an estimated 14,122 deaths, 517,284 malaria attacks and 942,347 work shift losses were averted. Overall, 127,226 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were averted per 3-year incremental period. The cumulative costs of malaria control interventions were 11,169,472 US dollars (in 1995 US dollars). Because the control programmes were so effective, the mining companies attracted a large reservoir of migrant labourers and sustained healthy work forces. The programmes averted an estimated 796,622 US dollars in direct treatment costs and 5,678,745 US dollars in indirect costs as a result of reduced work absenteeism. Within a few years of programme initiation, Northern Rhodesia became the leading copper producer in Africa, and mining generated the dominant share of national income. Copper production and revenues, which increased dramatically during malaria control interventions, amounted to the equivalent of 7.1 billion US dollars (in 1995 US dollars). Integrated malaria control in copper mining communities was a sound investment. It had payoff for public and occupational health, generally, and without it copper extraction and social and economic development would have been impossible."

CD011431,0,19478249,1,Effect of malaria rapid diagnostic tests on the management of uncomplicated malaria with artemether-lumefantrine in Kenya: a cluster randomized trial.,"Shortly after Kenya introduced artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria, we conducted a pre-post cluster randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of providing malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) on recommended treatment (patients with malaria prescribed AL) and overtreatment (patients without malaria prescribed AL) in outpatients >/= 5 years old. Sixty health facilities were randomized to receive either RDTs plus training, guidelines, and supervision (TGS) or TGS alone. Of 1,540 patients included in the analysis, 7% had uncomplicated malaria. The provision of RDTs coupled with TGS emphasizing AL use only after laboratory confirmation of malaria reduced recommended treatment by 63%-points (P = 0.04), because diagnostic test use did not change (-2%-points), but health workers significantly reduced presumptive treatment with AL for patients with a clinical diagnosis of malaria who did not undergo testing (-36%-points; P = 0.03). Health workers generally adhered to RDT results when prescribing AL: 88% of RDT-positive and 9% of RDT-negative patients were treated with AL, respectively. Overtreatment was low in both arms and was not significantly reduced by the provision of RDTs (-12%-points, P = 0.30). RDTs could potentially improve malaria case management, but we urgently need to develop more effective strategies for implementing guidelines before large scale implementation."

Here, a stimuli-responsive nanoparticle system is presented for multiplexed magneto-enrichment and non-instrumented lateral flow strip detection of model antigens from spiked pooled plasma. The integrated reagent system allows purification and enrichment of the gold-labeled biomarker half-sandwich that can be applied directly to lateral flow test strips. A linear diblock copolymer with a thermally responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) segment and a gold-binding block composed of NIPAm-co-N,N-dimethylaminoethylacrylamide was prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The diblock copolymer was used to functionalize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), with subsequent bioconjugation to yield thermally responsive pNIPAm-AuNPs that were co-decorated with streptavidin. These AuNPs efficiently complexed biotinylated capture antibody reagents that were bound to picomolar quantities of pan-aldolase and Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) in spiked pooled plasma samples. The gold-labeled biomarker half-sandwich was then purified and enriched using 10 nm thermally responsive magnetic nanoparticles that were similarly decorated with pNIPAm. When a thermal stimulus was applied in conjunction with a magnetic field, coaggregation of the AuNP half-sandwiches with the pNIPAm-coated iron oxide nanoparticles created large aggregates that were efficiently magnetophoresed and separated from bulk serum. The purified biomarkers from a spiked pooled plasma sample could be concentrated 50-fold into a small volume and applied directly to a commercial multiplexed lateral flow strip to dramatically improve the signal-to-noise ratio and test sensitivity."

One of the groups consisted of individuals with malaria-like symptoms (n = 113) and the other of asymptomatic individuals (n = 89). The classical microscopy analysis of these populations determined that 67.5% were infected with P. vivax, 31.3% with P. falciparum, and 1.2% with mixed infections. The OptiMAL test showed 96.4% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, 97.5% negative predictive value and optimal concordance (kappa = 0.97), capable of detecting any malaria infection in the evaluated population. However, these parameters were lower when the parasitaemia was < or = 300 parasites/microL. Freezing of the samples did not affect the sensitivity and specificity of the test. We concluded that this rapid malaria test is sensitive and specific for rapid diagnosis of malaria in the field and it is a complement to conventional microscopy."

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate, in a field setting, the performance of several such assays for Plasmodium falciparum infection and to examine the usefulness of these assays in identifying subjects for treatment trials in rural field sites. Residents of 12 villages in Laos who presented with fever were eligible for inclusion. Blood was collected by fingerprick for a dipstick assay, developed by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), performed and interpreted in the field by local healthcare workers. Compared with 'blinded' reference microscopy (N =196), the sensitivity and specificity of the PATH assay were 96.2% and 93.0%, respectively. Two rapid diagnostic assays (PATH and OptiMAL) were also performed on the subset of subjects eligible to participate in an in-vivo treatment trial (N = 97), and the results again compared with those of 'blinded' reference microscopy. In this subset, a subject was considered a 'true positive' if found positive by microscopy or the alternate rapid assay. Using this modified reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the PATH assay were 96.7% and 94.4%, and those of the OptiMAL assay were 91.8% and 100%, respectively. Both of the rapid assays tested therefore appear suitable for use in rural field settings by local healthcare providers and can accurately identify participants for treatment trials."

To improve current RDTs, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for novel malaria antigens have been developed and screened for their possible use in new diagnostic tests. Three antigens, glutamate rich protein (GLURP), dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) and heme detoxification protein (HDP), were selected based on literature searches. Recombinant antigens were produced and used to immunize mice. Antibody-producing cell lines were subsequently selected and the resulting antibodies were screened for specificity against Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The most optimal antibody couples were selected based on antibody affinity (expressed as dissociation constants, KD) and detection limit of crude antigen extract from P. falciparum 3D7 culture. The highest affinity antibodies have KD values of 0.10 nM ± 0.014 (D5) and 0.068 ± 0.015 nM (D6) for DHFR-TS mAbs, 0.10 ± 0.022 nM (H16) and 0.21 ± 0.022 nM (H18) for HDP mAbs and 0.11 ± 0.028 nM (G23) and 0.33 ± 0.093 nM (G22) for GLURP mAbs.

Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been presented as a means to realize the new guidelines, and National Malaria Control Programmes, including that of Cameroon, are developing plans to introduce the tests to replace microscopy or clinical diagnosis at public health facilities across the country. We aimed to understand how malaria tests and antimalarial drugs are currently used as part of social interactions between health workers and patients at public and mission health facilities in Yaoundé and Bamenda and surrounding districts in the Northwest region of Cameroon. In May to June 2010, we held 17 focus group discussions with 146 health workers involved in clinical care from 49 health facilities. Clinicians enacted malaria as a 'juggling' exercise, involving attention to pathophysiology of the patient as well as their desires and medical reputations, utilising tests and medicines for their therapeutic effects as symbols in the process of care. Parasites were rarely mentioned in describing diagnostic decisions. These enactments of malaria contrast with evidence-based guidelines emanating from WHO, which assume the parasite is the central driver of practice. If RDTs are to be taken up in practice, public health practitioners need to pay careful attention to the values and priorities of health workers and patients if they are to work with them to improve diagnosis and treatment of febrile illnesses."

CD011431,0,2011638,0,Malaria.,"Human malaria is caused by four species of the genus plasmodium. The sexual stage of the parasite occurs in the mosquito and asexual reproduction occurs in man. Symptoms of fever, chills, headache, and myalgia result from the invasion and rupture of erythrocytes. Merozoites are released from erythrocytes and invade other cells, thus propagating the infection. The most vulnerable hosts are nonimmune travelers, young children living in the tropics, and pregnant women. P. falciparum causes the most severe infections because it infects RBCs of all ages and has the propensity to develop resistance to antimalarials. Rapid diagnosis can be made with a malarial smear, and treatment should be initiated promptly. In some regions (Mexico, Central America except Panama, and North Africa) chloroquine phosphate is effective therapy. In subsaharan Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia, chloroquine resistance has become widespread, and other antimalarials are necessary. The primary care physician should have a high index of suspicion for malaria in the traveler returning from the tropics. Malaria should also be suspected in the febrile transfusion recipient and newborns of mothers with malaria."

In this retrospective study, 33 deaths (25 men and 8 women) caused by falciparum malaria reported in Switzerland from 1988 to 2002 were analyzed. The case fatality ratio (CFR) for the falciparum infections for the 15-year period was 1.2%, with a peak of 2.2% in 1991. Sub-Saharan Africa was the source of all the imported fatal infections. Non-immune Europeans had a significantly higher case fatality ratio than the non-Europeans (1.7% versus 0.2%; P < 0.001). Careless use or non-use of prophylaxis, sometimes because of physicians giving unsatisfactory pre-travel advice, and initially missed diagnosis post-travel were factors that contributed to the development of severe infections leading to death. Travelers should be sensitized to the risk of malaria by well-informed general practitioners. Updated information is readily available (www.safetravel.ch). Regarding diagnosis and treatment, greater physician awareness of the disease is needed, and expert advice should be sought without hesitation. Rapid malaria tests may be a useful diagnostic adjunct in centers where microscopic expertise is lacking. Falciparum malaria in a non-immune patient is an emergency requiring immediate treatment."

We tested 896 patients, of whom microscopy confirmed 139 P. falciparum, 279 P. vivax, and 13 mixed P.f/P.v infections and 465 negatives. Paracheck-Pf and NOW-malaria-ICT were more accurate in detecting P. falciparum (sensitivities 90.8% and 90.1%, respectively) in comparison with Optimal-IT (83.6%). NOW showed an acceptable Pf detection rate at low densities (< 500/microL), but resulted in a higher proportion of false positives. For P. vivax diagnosis, Optimal-IT had a higher sensitivity than NOW (91.0% and 81.4%, respectively). The choice between the two Pf/Pv detecting RDTs balances P. falciparum and P. vivax detection rates. Considering some degree of P. falciparum overtreatment and failure to detect all P. vivax cases as more acceptable than missing some cases of P. falciparum, we recommend careful implementation of NOW-malaria-ICT in areas where microscopy is lacking. The price is however still a constraint."

Laveran in 1880. Recently, a new direct diagnosis technique, the Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC)* Malaria Diagnosis System, has been developed. We compared this technique with the thick blood smear diagnosis in a study of the efficacy of chloroquine therapy in Zaire. A total of 815 subjects were screened; 71 participated in the trial. They were given chloroquine at a dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight over three days and were examined for parasitemia two and seven days after treatment. Chloroquine resistance was detected in 38% of the subjects by thick blood smear and in 45% by the QBC test. Of greater interest was the time required for each diagnosis: an average of 17 min was required to examine microscopic fields with 1,000 leukocytes by thick blood smear analysis compared with less than one min by the QBC system. In addition, we did not observe diminished attention from fatigue by microscopists using the QBC system despite the large number of tests conducted. We conclude that the QBC system is an important tool for studies of drug resistance."

In this study, we developed a sensitive, genus-specific, real-time quantitative PCR assay. It was compared with the microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears and two different molecular diagnostic techniques: nested PCR and multiplex PCR. For the effective quantitative detection of malaria parasites, all reagents were designed with a lyophilized format in one tube. Plasmodium was detected successfully in all 112 clinically suspected malaria patients, including 32 individuals with low parasitemia (1-100 parasites/μl). The sensitivity threshold was 0.2 parasites/μl and no PCR-positive reaction occurred when malaria parasites were not present. This may be a useful method for detecting malaria parasites in endemic areas."
CD011431,0,22589226,0,"Willingness-to-pay for a rapid malaria diagnostic test and artemisinin-based combination therapy from private drug shops in Mukono District, Uganda.","In Uganda, as in many parts of Africa, the majority of the population seek treatment for malaria in drug shops as their first point of care; however, parasitological diagnosis is not usually offered in these outlets. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria have attracted interest in recent years as a tool to improve malaria diagnosis, since they have proved accurate and easy to perform with minimal training. Although RDTs could feasibly be performed by drug shop vendors, it is not known how much customers would be willing to pay for an RDT if offered in these settings. We conducted a contingent valuation survey among drug shop customers in Mukono District, Uganda. Exit interviews were undertaken with customers aged 15 years and above after leaving a drug shop having purchased an antimalarial and/or paracetamol. The bidding game technique was used to elicit the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for an RDT and a course of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) with and without RDT confirmation. Factors associated with WTP were investigated using linear regression. The geometric mean WTP for an RDT was US$0.53, US$1.82 for a course of ACT and US$2.05 for a course of ACT after a positive RDT. Factors strongly associated with a higher WTP for these commodities included having a higher socio-economic status, no fever/malaria in the household in the past 2 weeks and if a malaria diagnosis had been obtained from a qualified health worker prior to visiting the drug shop. The findings further suggest that the WTP for an RDT and a course of ACT among drug shop customers is considerably lower than prevailing and estimated end-user prices for these commodities. Increasing the uptake of ACTs in drug shops and restricting the sale of ACTs to parasitologically confirmed malaria will therefore require additional measures."

CD011431,0,11591804,0,Unique T cell effector functions elicited by Plasmodium falciparum epitopes in malaria-exposed Africans tested by three T cell assays.,"Natural immunity to malaria is characterized by low level CD4 T cell reactivity detected by either lymphoproliferation or IFN-gamma secretion. Here we show a doubling in the detection rate of responders to the carboxyl terminus of circumsporozoite protein (CS) of Plasmodium falciparum by employing three T cell assays simultaneously: rapid IFN-gamma secretion (ex vivo ELISPOT), IFN-gamma secretion after reactivation of memory T cells and expansion in vitro (cultured ELISPOT), and lymphoproliferation. Remarkably, for no individual peptide did a positive response for one T cell effector function correlate with any other. Thus these CS epitopes elicited unique T cell response patterns in malaria-exposed donors. Novel or important epitope responses may therefore be missed if only one T cell assay is employed. A borderline correlation was found between anti-CS Ab levels and proliferative responses, but no correlation was found with ex vivo or cultured IFN-gamma responses. This suggested that the proliferating population, but not the IFN-gamma-secreting cells, contained cells that provide help for Ab production. The data suggest that natural immunity to malaria is a complex function of T cell subgroups with different effector functions and has important implications for future studies of natural T cell immunity."

Of the 98 febrile patients screened, 22 were ICT positive for P. falciparum. Simultaneous microscopic examination of the blood smears of these ICT positive patients showed that 20 were positive for P. falciparum alone, whereas one had mix infection of both P. vivax and P. falciparum suggesting 100% sensitivity. Only one slide negative patient who had taken 600 mg chloroquine the previous day was positive in the ICT. Out of the remaining 76 blood smears, 41 showed P. vivax infection and none cross-reacted with P. falciparum HRP-2 antigen and were ICT negative except one mix infection case in which P. vivax and P. falciparum infections occurred concomitantly suggesting species specificity of 98.7%. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value and efficacy of the ICT were 95.4, 100 and 98.9% respectively. The band intensity of the ICT positive cases significantly correlated with P. falciparum parasitaemia (p < 0.01).

We evaluated the new combined P. falciparum-P. vivax immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria P.f/P.v.) in Radamata Primary Health Centre, Sumba, Indonesia, from February to May 1998 with 560 symptomatic adults and children with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of malaria. Blinded microscopy was used as the ""gold standard,"" with all discordant and 20% of concordant results cross-checked blindly. Only 50% of those with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of malaria were parasitemic. The ICT Malaria P.f/P.v immunochromatographic test was sensitive (95. 5%) and specific (89.8%) for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria, with a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 88.1 and 96.2%, respectively. HRP2 and panmalarial antigen line intensities were associated with parasitemia density for both species. Although the specificity and NPV for the diagnosis of vivax malaria were 94.8 and 98.2%, respectively, the overall sensitivity (75%) and PPV (50%) for the diagnosis of vivax malaria were less than the desirable levels. The sensitivity for the diagnosis of P. vivax malaria was 96% with parasitemias of >500/microl but only 29% with parasitemias of <500/microl. Nevertheless, compared with the test with HRP2 alone, use of the combined antigen detection test would reduce the rate of undertreatment from 14.7 to 3.6% for microscopy-positive patients, and this would be at the expense of only a modest increase in the rate of overtreatment of microscopy-negative patients from 7.1 to 15. 4%.

A rapid in vitro immunodiagnostic test, the NOW ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test kit was used for the detection of circulating Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) antigens in whole blood. Peripheral blood microscopy confirmed mixed-species infection in all the cases. Thick and thin peripheral blood films were made and stained with Giemsa stain and examined by both hospital laboratory staff and an experienced parasitologist who was blinded to the results of the rapid malarial antigen tests. Four recent patients (all male; mean age, 24 years) with mixed malarial infection were identified. All the subjects were males working for an oil company in a coastal area of Pakistan, and all had been diagnosed presumptively with malaria based on clinical grounds (without microbiologic confirmation), and were treated empirically with chloroquine without clinical response. Semiquantitative malaria counts via microscopy were as follows: P. vivax, scanty (2 patients) and moderate (2 patients); for P. falciparum--scanty (1 patient), moderate (2 patients), and heavy (1 patient). The present case series, although limited by the small number of patients with proven mixed P. falciparum-P. vivax infection, highlights the usefulness of the rapid antigen test in a highly malarious region of Pakistan where chloroquine resistance is prevalent. Although there was full concordance between the results of blood smear microscopy and rapid antigen testing, these techniques are potentially most useful when there is a discrepancy with microscopy findings. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of parasites, particularly in cases of mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax infection, is of immense importance for individual patient management and in reducing the burden of disease, especially in regions of chloroquine resistance."

Four field surveys were conducted in malaria-endemic areas of Palawan and Davao del Norte, Philippines to validate the various rapid diagnostic tests, namely Diamed OptiMAL 48 (DiaMed AG, Switzerland), ParaHIT f (Span Diagnostics, India), Orchid OptiMAL, and Paracheck Pf (both from Orchid Biomedical Systems, India). The results of the various rapid diagnostic tests were compared to those of microscopy. Sensitivity, specificity and detection rates according to the level of parasitemia were used as parameters to describe the performance of the various rapid diagnostic tests in the field. Practical and operational assessments were also done. The results of the study show that the sensitivity and detection rates were generally lower than previously reported, with sensitivities ranging from 4.8% to 20.6%, except for Diamed OptiMAL 48, which had sensitivities of 78.8% to 96.8%, and detection rates of 50.0% to 96.8%. The rest had detection rates ranging from 0.0% to 50.0%. All the specificities ranged from 18.2% to 100.0%. Improper conditions at the time of manufacturing, storage, transport, and utilization may affect the validity of the results. Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria provide practical means of detecting malarial infections, especially in endemic areas.

Our study was conducted during November 2007-January 2008 to assess test accuracy of an RDT in the management of febrile outpatients in a peripheral urban health facility in Cameroon. We found the overall sensitivity to be 71.4% and a specificity of 82.2%; the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 73.8% and 80.4%, respectively. False-negative and false-positive cases represented 11.8% and 10.5% of all febrile patients. Malaria alone (31.3%) was the first cause of fever; 33.5% of fever cases were of unknown origin. Acute respiratory infections were common among children 0-2 years of age (25.5%) and decreased with age. The risk of having a clinical failure with the presumptive treatment of febrile children was seven times greater than that of the RDT-oriented management (relative risk = 6.8, 95% confidence interval = 0.88-53.4, P = 0.03) because of the delay of appropriate treatment of non-malarial febrile illness. Our results suggest that the RDT may be of limited utility for children greater than five years of age and adults and that diagnosis based on microscopic examination of blood smears should be recommended for these patient populations, as well as in areas of low transmission."

The availability of a battery-powered centrifuge and a fiberoptic Paralens enabled us to complete and interpret the assay in this remote environment. Of 322 QBC tubes examined for 2-4 min each, results of 295 (92%) concurred with findings on the matched Giemsa-stained thick smear (GTS). The 27 discrepant results included 13 QBC+/GTS- that, upon reexamination, were found to be GTS+. When using the corrected GTS results as the standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the QBC were 94% and 96%, respectively. Because electricity was available only 3 hr per day, it was decided to decrease the examination for an additional 248 QBC to a maximum of 90 sec per tube. This shortened inspection time resulted in a reduction of sensitivity to 53% but specificity was preserved at 89%. Forty-two of 45 conflicting results, QBC-/GTS+ from cases of light Plasmodium falciparum infections with < 1 trophozoite or gametocyte per field, were resolved by reexamination of the QBC in the laboratory. Tubes held at 4 C could be reexamined, without noticeable loss of fluorescence, for at least 6 wk after collection. Despite some difficulty in the identification of Plasmodium species, it was concluded that the QBC is an easy, sensitive method for the rapid diagnosis of malaria in the field and that it provides the inexperienced microscopist with an additional means for on-site identification of individuals needing treatment."

CD011431,0,12219143,1,Performance of OptiMAL(R) in the diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections in a malaria referral center in Colombia.,"Alternative, non-microscopic methods for the diagnosis of malaria have recently become available. Among these, rapid dipstick methods stand out. One such test, OptiMAL(R), is based on the immunochromatographic detection of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and has the capacity to detect and distinguish infections caused by P. falciparum and Plasmodium sp. This capacity is particularly important in countries where different species of Plasmodium co-exist. In this study we evaluated the performance of OptiMAL(R) in an urban referral center for malaria diagnosis. Two sets of patients were included: one (n = 112) having predetermined infections with P. falciparum or P. vivax and individuals with negative blood smears; and another consisting of all eligible consecutive patients (n = 80) consulting for diagnosis at the referral center during one month. The overall diagnostic efficiency of OptiMAL(R) for both sets of patients was 96.9%. Efficiency was higher for P. vivax (98.1%) than for P. falciparum (94.9%). These results corroborate the diagnostic utility of OptiMAL(R) in settings where P. vivax and P. falciparum co-exist and support its implementation where microscopic diagnosis is unavailable and in circumstances that exceed the capacity of the local microscopic diagnosis facility."
CD011431,0,19362256,1,Malaria overdiagnosis and burden of malaria misdiagnosis in the suburbs of central Sudan: special emphasis on artemisinin-based combination therapy era.,"Accuracy of diagnosis is central for malaria control. Although microscopy is gold standard in malaria diagnosis, its reliability is largely dependent on user skill. In this study, we evaluated practitioners' clinical and microscopists' technical skills in diagnosis of malaria in central Sudan. In a retrospective study, 3203 blood smears from 95 peripheral health facilities (each represented by a general practitioner [GP] and general microscopist [GM]) were reexamined by expert microscopist. Furthermore, in a prospective study, 410 patients had their malaria diagnosis rechecked by rapid diagnostic test for validation of the microscopic diagnosis. Results showed that the rate of false-positive diagnosis of malaria was 75.6% and false-negative diagnosis was 0.01%. The study disclosed poor skills of the GPs and GMs in malaria diagnosis because 43% of the GPs and 44% of the GMs failed to make a single true-positive malaria diagnosis. The false-positive malaria diagnosis showed bias toward adult females. Economically, the calculated cost of diagnosis and treatment of malaria in Sudan in year 2000 is US$100 million, whereas the calculated cost of true malaria is approximately US$14 million. In conclusion, malaria overdiagnosis was widely recognized in central Sudan, with high economic burden during the era of artemisinin-based combination therapy. Finally, different scenarios were suggested for improvement of malaria diagnosis."

The substitution of newer and more costly drugs brings with it the need for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive diagnostic procedures so that directed therapy can be used. We report a field trial comparing standard microscopic malaria diagnosis and quantitative buffy coat analysis to a new P. falciparum antigen detection system. The ParaSight F test (PFT) was found to be easy to learn, rapid to perform, and highly accurate. If confirmed, the use of the PFT in endemic areas may aid in the identification of patients requiring therapy for drug-resistant malaria."
CD011431,0,21599880,0,"""Test and treat"" or presumptive treatment for malaria in high transmission situations? A reflection on the latest WHO guidelines.","Recent WHO guidelines recommend a universal ""test and treat"" strategy for malaria, mainly by use of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in all areas. The evidence for this approach is questioned here as there is a risk of over-reliance on parasitological diagnosis in high transmission situations, which still exist. In such areas, when a patient has fever or other malaria symptoms, the presence of Plasmodium spp neither reliably confirms malaria as the cause of the fever, nor excludes the possibility of other diseases. This is because the patient may be an asymptomatic carrier of malaria parasites and suffer from another disease. To allow clinicians to perform their work adequately, local epidemiologic data are necessary. One size does not fit all. If parasite prevalence in the population is low, a diagnostic test is relevant; if the prevalence is high, the test does not provide information of any clinical usefulness, as happens with any test in medicine when the prevalence of the tested characteristic is high in the healthy population. It should also be remembered that, if in some cases anti-malarials are prescribed to parasite-negative patients, this will not increase selection pressure for drug resistance, because the parasite is not there. In high transmission situations at least, other diagnoses should be sought in all patients, irrespective of the presence of malaria parasites. For this, clinical skills (but not necessarily physicians) are irreplaceable, in order to differentiate malaria from other causes of acute fever, such as benign viral infection or potentially dangerous conditions, which can all be present with the parasite co-existing only as a ""commensal"" or silent undesirable guest."

Field trials indicate that this dipstick assay provides consistently reproducible results, with a threshold of detection of P. falciparum parasitaemia similar to that obtained by high quality routine malaria microscopy and a specificity and sensitivity of around 90% compared with standard thick blood film microscopy. The stability, reproducibility, and ease of use of the assay clearly indicate that it has potential for application in the management of malaria, particularly at the peripheral health care level, provided its accuracy can be assured and that it can be made affordable. Consideration should be given to its wider use where operational requirements and resources so justify, and where decisions are based on adequate evaluation of the existing health delivery systems."

CD011431,0,21349623,0,Introducing malaria rapid diagnostic tests at registered drug shops in Uganda: limitations of diagnostic testing in the reality of diagnosis.,"In Uganda, around two thirds of medicines are procured from the private sector, mostly from drug shops. The introduction of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) at drug shops therefore has the potential to make a significant contribution to targeting antimalarial drugs to those with malaria parasites. We undertook formative research in a district in Uganda in preparation for a randomised trial of RDTs in drug shops. In May to July 2009, we interviewed 9 drug shop workers, 5 health workers and 4 district health officials and carried out 10 focus group discussions with a total of 75 community members to investigate the role of drug shops and the potential for implementation of RDTs at these health care outlets. Drug shops were seen to provide an important service to community members, the nature of which is determined by responsiveness to client demands. However, drug shops hold a liminal status: in the eyes of different actors, these outlets are at once a shop and clinic; legitimate and illegitimate; and trusted and distrusted. Malaria treatment was found to be synonymous with diagnosis. Diagnostic testing was deemed useful in theory, and community members were curious about the results, with the expectation that a test would decrease uncertainty and help secure an end to illness. However, whether testing would be sought as a routine step in treatment decisions in practice is uncertain, since the appeal of the tests waned in light of their costs and potential for results to conflict with presumed diagnosis. Interventions that increase awareness of multiple causes and management of malaria-like illness will be needed to support the new rationalisation for malaria treatment represented by parasitological diagnosis."

One group received written instructions only, while another group was given combined oral and written instructions on how to test their own blood for malaria infection and interpret a series of 5 prepared test strips. Each volunteer also completed a questionnaire targeted at assessing performance in using the diagnostic, interpretation of the results and acceptability of the concept of self-testing for malaria infection. The main outcome measures were successful performance of the test, correct interpretation of prepared test strips and acceptability of the test. In the group which received only written instructions, 60/80 (75%) were successful, whilst in the group which received written and oral instructions, 72/80 (90%) successfully performed the test (P < 0.02). Overall, 565 (70.6%) test strips were correctly and 165 (20.6%) incorrectly interpreted with 113 (14.1%) false negative interpretations. No prepared test strip was interpreted as false positive. Seventy (8.8%) test strips were not interpreted. Some 91. 9% of all candidates would use such a test if it were available. While it is possible for lay persons to successfully perform the test, interpretation of results poses a problem. In particular, the proportion of false negative interpretations is unacceptable. A combination of written and oral instructions leads to a significantly higher level of successful test performance. If such a test is to be made available to the general public, written instructions must be made concise and foolproof and the test endpoint clearly defined, as the currently available test is more suitable for trained laboratory personnel. In the meantime other candidate diagnostics have become available and these should now be assessed for their suitability in the context of travellers' malaria."

CD011431,0,11490988,0,Vector-borne infections in the tropics and health policy issues in the twenty-first century.,"Over the past 2 decades scientific advances and evolving strategies have significantly contributed to improved tools for control of vector-borne infections. These are: diagnostics--rapid assessment methods, non-invasive or minimally so yet sensitive and specific; new chemotherapeutics; pyrethroid insecticides and biological insecticidal products; refined strategies, such as combination therapy, rotation of insecticides for resistance management, community-directed treatment, standardized monitoring and evaluation to define programme progress; better epidemiological knowledge through improved identification of parasites and vectors; GIS, remote sensing and climate models which provide tools for epidemic prediction, planning control programmes and permit effective policy analysis; greater involvement of NGDOs (non-governmental development organizations) and CSOs (civil society organizations) in control; advent of donation programmes which involve community-based or directed mass drug distribution. Future problems could be: (1) the over-emphasis on inflexible financing by the insistence of donors on SWAps (sector-wide investment), (2) the over-reliance on pyrethroid pesticides, (3) the over-expectation that basic research will provide new drugs and vaccines for resource-poor settings in the necessary time scales, and (4) the failure to recognize that biological processes have an inherent capacity for change which outstrips the capacity of health services to respond. Malaria is a paradigm of an 'emerging disease'. (5) The challenge of implementing a 'vertical' approach to disease control within national health programmes, in the face of significant donor opposition to such programmes is a challenge even when such approaches will secure a 'public good'."

Sensitivity was 92% for HRP2 and 85% for pLDH, with differences primarily due to better detection with HRP2 at low parasite densities. Specificity was 93% for HRP2 and 100% for pLDH, with differences primarily due to rapid clearance of pLDH antigenemia after treatment of a previous malaria episode. RDTs may provide an effective strategy for improving rational delivery of antimalarial therapy; in Kampala, either test could dramatically decrease inappropriate presumptive treatments."

CD011431,0,16937184,0,Automated image processing method for the diagnosis and classification of malaria on thin blood smears.,"Malaria is a serious global health problem, and rapid, accurate diagnosis is required to control the disease. An image processing algorithm to automate the diagnosis of malaria on thin blood smears is developed. The image classification system is designed to positively identify malaria parasites present in thin blood smears, and differentiate the species of malaria. Images are acquired using a charge-coupled device camera connected to a light microscope. Morphological and novel threshold selection techniques are used to identify erythrocytes (red blood cells) and possible parasites present on microscopic slides. Image features based on colour, texture and the geometry of the cells and parasites are generated, as well as features that make use of a priori knowledge of the classification problem and mimic features used by human technicians. A two-stage tree classifier using backpropogation feedforward neural networks distinguishes between true and false positives, and then diagnoses the species (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale or P. malariae) of the infection. Malaria samples obtained from the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the University of the Witwatersrand Medical School are used for training and testing of the system. Infected erythrocytes are positively identified with a sensitivity of 85% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 81%, which makes the method highly sensitive at diagnosing a complete sample provided many views are analysed. Species were correctly determined for 11 out of 15 samples."

CD011431,0,21311583,0,A research agenda for malaria eradication: diagnoses and diagnostics.,"Many of malaria's signs and symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other febrile diseases. Detection of the presence of Plasmodium parasites is essential, therefore, to guide case management. Improved diagnostic tools are required to enable targeted treatment of infected individuals. In addition, field-ready diagnostic tools for mass screening and surveillance that can detect asymptomatic infections of very low parasite densities are needed to monitor transmission reduction and ensure elimination. Antibody-based tests for infection and novel methods based on biomarkers need further development and validation, as do methods for the detection and treatment of Plasmodium vivax. Current rapid diagnostic tests targeting P. vivax are generally less effective than those targeting Plasmodium falciparum. Moreover, because current drugs for radical cure may cause serious side effects in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, more information is needed on the distribution of G6PD-deficiency variants as well as tests to identify at-risk individuals. Finally, in an environment of very low or absent malaria transmission, sustaining interest in elimination and maintaining resources will become increasingly important.

A 41-year-old woman was admitted for severe abdominal pain, melaena, fever and anuria two hours after quinine tablet intake for nocturnal leg cramps. Her medical history included angioneurotic edema caused by chloroquine for malaria prevention. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory data showed acute renal failure, hemolytic anemia without schistocytes and Dic. Platelet antibodies were negative.

Sixty-nine (89.6%) of 77 parasitologically confirmed cases examined at the Daloa clinic had antigens in serum; 35 (45.5%) had antigens in CSF and, in 4 of these, the antigens were detected in CSF only. Taking the serum and CSF results together, 73 (94.8%) of the 77 patients were positive in the assay. In the Kinshasa series, 168 (89.4%) of 188 parasitologically confirmed cases were positive by antigen ELISA. The controls, who included 165 blood donors and 40 patients with malaria, 2 with hydatidosis and 12 with leishmaniasis, were negative by antigen ELISA. Analysis of CSF results for 35 patients who had antigens in CSF revealed that 34 (97.1%) had elevated CSF white cell counts, 29 (82.9%) had elevated protein levels, and 23 (65.7%) had trypanosomes in their CSF. Moreover, analysis of results for 34 patients whose CSF had been shown to harbour trypanosomes by the double centrifugation technique showed that 24 (70.6%) had antigens in CSF, 28 (82.6%) had elevated protein levels, and 33 (97.1%) had elevated CSF white cell counts. Antigens were rapidly cleared from peripheral circulation following institution of treatment. Antigen clearance was accompanied by a rapid fall in CSF protein levels and white cell counts. These results demonstrate the potential of antigen ELISA, not only as a tool for diagnosis, but also for clinical staging and treatment follow-up of patients with T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness."

This cross-sectional study assessed the spectrum of parasitic infection and level of anemia and their effect on nutritional status in settled and mobile pastoral mothers and children near Lake Chad. Intestinal parasites were evaluated using direct fecal smears and the Kato-Katz technique. Malaria status was determined using Paracheck-Pf(®) rapid diagnostic test, and anemia was assessed with the Hemocue photometer. Nutritional status was evaluated using anthropometric parameters. At the end of the 2008 wet season, the prevalence of malnutrition was 36% [confidence interval (CI) 30-42] among women and 15% (CI 11-18) among children. The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was 75% (CI 68-83) among women and 60% (CI 53-66) among children. The predominant helminth species was Ascaris lumbricoides while Entamoeba histolytica/dispar was the most common protozoan. The hookworm prevalence was 14% (CI 8-20) in women and 18% (CI 13-23) in children. Malaria prevalence was low among women (1%, CI 0.5-2) and children (3% CI 2-5).

CD011431,0,23438048,0,Malaria rapid diagnostic tests in endemic settings.,"Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are instrument-free tests that provide results within 20 min and can be used by community health workers. RDTs detect antigens produced by the Plasmodium parasite such as Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHPR2) and Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). The accuracy of RDTs for the diagnosis of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection is equal or superior to routine microscopy (but inferior to expert microscopy). Sensitivity for Plasmodium vivax is 75-100%; for Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae, diagnostic performance is poor. Design limitations of RDTs include poor sensitivity at low parasite densities, susceptibility to the prozone effect (PfHRP2-detecting RDTs), false-negative results due to PfHRP2 deficiency in the case of pfhrp2 gene deletions (PfHRP2-detecting RDTs), cross-reactions between Plasmodium antigens and detection antibodies, false-positive results by other infections and susceptibility to heat and humidity. End-user's errors relate to safety, procedure (delayed reading, incorrect sample and buffer volumes) and interpretation (not recognizing invalid test results, disregarding faint test lines). Withholding antimalarial treatment in the case of negative RDT results tends to be infrequent and tendencies towards over-prescription of antibiotics have been noted. Numerous shortcomings in RDT kits' labelling, instructions for use (correctness and readability) and contents have been observed. The World Health Organization and partners actively address quality assurance of RDTs by comparative testing of RDTs, inspections of manufacturing sites, lot testing and training tools but no formal external quality assessment programme of end-user performance exists. Elimination of malaria requires RDTs with lower detection limits, for which nucleic acid amplification tests are under development."

CD011431,0,21525225,0,Applied genomics: data mining reveals species-specific malaria diagnostic targets more sensitive than 18S rRNA.,"Accurate and rapid diagnosis of malaria infections is crucial for implementing species-appropriate treatment and saving lives. Molecular diagnostic tools are the most accurate and sensitive method of detecting Plasmodium, differentiating between Plasmodium species, and detecting subclinical infections. Despite available whole-genome sequence data for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, the majority of PCR-based methods still rely on the 18S rRNA gene targets. Historically, this gene has served as the best target for diagnostic assays. However, it is limited in its ability to detect mixed infections in multiplex assay platforms without the use of nested PCR. New diagnostic targets are needed. Ideal targets will be species specific, highly sensitive, and amenable to both single-step and multiplex PCRs. We have mined the genomes of P. falciparum and P. vivax to identify species-specific, repetitive sequences that serve as new PCR targets for the detection of malaria. We show that these targets (Pvr47 and Pfr364) exist in 14 to 41 copies and are more sensitive than 18S rRNA when utilized in a single-step PCR. Parasites are routinely detected at levels of 1 to 10 parasites/μl. The reaction can be multiplexed to detect both species in a single reaction. We have examined 7 P. falciparum strains and 91 P. falciparum clinical isolates from Tanzania and 10 P. vivax strains and 96 P. vivax clinical isolates from Venezuela, and we have verified a sensitivity and specificity of ∼100% for both targets compared with a nested 18S rRNA approach. We show that bioinformatics approaches can be successfully applied to identify novel diagnostic targets and improve molecular methods for pathogen detection. These novel targets provide a powerful alternative molecular diagnostic method for the detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax in conventional or multiplex PCR platforms."

Transfusion-transmitted malaria may lead to serious problems because infection with Plasmodium falciparum may cause rapidly fatal death. This study aimed to compare real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) with rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and light microscopy for the detection of Plasmodium spp. in blood transfusion, both in endemic and non-endemic areas of malaria disease in Iran. Two sets of 50 blood samples were randomly collected. One set was taken from blood samples donated in blood bank of Bandar Abbas, a city located in a malarious-endemic area, and the other set from Tehran, a non-endemic one. Light microscopic examination on both thin and thick smears, RDTs, and real-time PCR were performed on the blood samples and the results were compared. Thin and thick light microscopic examinations of all samples as well as RDT results were negative for Plasmodium spp. Two blood samples from endemic area were positive only with real-time PCR. It seems that real-time PCR as a highly sensitive method can be helpful for the confirmation of malaria infection in different units of blood transfusion organization especially in malaria-endemic areas where the majority of donors may be potentially infected with malaria parasites."

It can be applied to many kinds of samples including serum, plasma, whole blood, eluted bloodspot and mosquito bloodmeal as well. The method makes use of a single microtiter plate and the chemically synthesized (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro)20 (NANP20) antigen both as coating material and as competitive (binding) inhibitor in the samples. The specific value of each sample is obtained as the absorbance difference between the uninhibited and the fully inhibited sample. Using appropriate conditions, the results can be evaluated by simple visual inspection of the plate, without any instrument. A rapid procedure, where the incubation times for sample and conjugate are just 15 minutes, is also described. When unknown samples from a P. falciparum endemic area were tested, a close correlation was found between our results and those obtained with the only commercial ELISA kit now available (Sclavo S.p.A).

We assessed a kit under research and development called CareStart™ G6PD deficiency screening test (Access Bio, New Jersey, USA) by comparing its performance to quantitative G6PD enzyme activity using a standardized spectrophotometric method ('gold standard'). Blood samples (n = 903) were collected from Cambodian adults living in Pailin province, western Cambodia. G6PD enzyme activities ranged from 0 to 20.5 U/g Hb (median 12.0 U/g Hg). Based on a normal haemoglobin concentration and wild-type G6PD gene, the normal values of G6PD enzymatic activity for this population was 3.6 to 20.5 U/g Hg (95(th) percentiles from 5.5 to 17.2 U/g Hg). Ninety-seven subjects (10.7%) had <3.6 U/g Hg and were classified as G6PD deficient. Prevalence of deficiency was 15.0% (64/425) among men and 6.9% (33/478) among women. Genotype was analyzed in 66 G6PD-deficient subjects and 63 of these exhibited findings consistent with Viangchang genotype. The sensitivity and specificity of the CareStart™ G6PD deficiency screening test was 0.68 and 1.0, respectively. Its detection threshold was <2.7 U/g Hg, well within the range of moderate and severe enzyme deficiencies. Thirteen subjects (1.4%, 12 males and 1 female) with G6PD enzyme activities <2 U/g Hg were falsely classified as ""normal"" by RDT.

The study was carried out in 2006 from November 10th to December 10th; it focused on patients who were seen and treated with ACT for suspicion of uncomplicated malaria in the health district of Ziguinchor, Senegal. The variables studied included age, sex, RDT results, and costs of care and RDT. The cost of care for malaria, estimated in CFA Francs, was evaluated both with and without the use of RDT. Among the 379 patients, 25,1% were aged 0-4 years, 12,7% of 5-14 years and 62,2% of at least 15 years; 51% were women. The result of the RDT was negative in 60% of cases. Without the use of diagnostic testing, the cost of care for all 379 cases was estimated at 299 957 CFA: patient contributions would cover 184 500 CFA and the State would cover the rest (115 457 CFA). With the use of RDTs, the overall cost of the RDT screening for 379 patients and the cost of treatment for the 150 positive cases amounted to 254 786 CFA, with patients bearing the cost of 205 550 CFA and the State subsidizing up to 49 236 CFA. RDT can help identify the positive cases of malaria, and avoid up to 60% of unnecessary treatments, corresponding to an estimated 27 297 cases at the district level and 584 630 cases nationally. The RDT also allow a more rational use of ACTs and a lower risk of emergence of Plasmodium resistance.

The major strategies for malaria control are vector control through indoor residual spraying, case management, disease surveillance, epidemic preparedness and response, and public awareness. There has been a significant and sustained decrease in malaria case notifications since 2000, as a result of intensive indoor residual spraying including the use of DDT to combat insecticide-resistant Anopheles funestus; the introduction of artemisinin combination therapy; and the Lebombo Spatial Initiative, a cross-border collaboration targeting malaria in eastern Swaziland, southern Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Rapid malaria antigen detection tests are widely used for diagnosis at primary health care level. HIV-malaria co-infected patients who are malaria non-immune are at risk for severe malaria.

Here we describe the use of mitochondrial targets for LAMP-based detection of any Plasmodium genus parasite and of P. falciparum specifically. These new targets allow routine amplification from samples containing as few as five parasites per microl of blood. Amplification is complete within 30 to 40 min and is assessed by real-time turbidimetry, thereby offering rapid diagnosis with greater sensitivity than is achieved by the most skilled microscopist or antigen detection using lateral flow immunoassays."

This practice requires some medical knowledge by mothers who want to treat their children. In Burkina Faso, the main source of the transmission of such knowledge and skills is the interaction between health professionals and mothers during consultations for their children. The main objective of this study was to assess the transfer of knowledge by health professionals to mothers about the causes, symptoms and treatment of malaria in the health district of Nouna, in the province of Kossi, Burkina Faso. The results showed that at the time of the interview very few mothers were able to recognize malaria and treat it adequately. Mothers' lack of malaria-related knowledge and skills was quite substantial and even more pronounced in the sample of mothers from villages. Many did not know the exact cause of malaria or how to treat it. In view of the factors that must be taken into account for the successful treatment of malaria at home (appropriate dose for age, appropriate duration of treatment, appropriate, i.e.,antimalarial, drugs, quality of drugs) it is estimated that only 3.5% of all interviewed mothers had the knowledge necessary to treat malaria correctly at home. Health professionals appeared to agree that the mothers lacked these skills, but our data revealed that they did not provide information to the mothers to address this lack. Specifically, they did not routinely provide information about prevention by mosquito nets, diagnosis based on key symptoms such as fever, the importance of rapid consultation, rules for antimalarial dosing according to age, the risks of under-medication or the dangers related to the purchase and consumption of street drugs that may be counterfeit or have expired."

Therefore, a method for rapidly detecting Plasmodium falciparum is necessary and useful. We have developed Wondfo rapid diagnostic kit based on nano-gold immunochromatography assay for the detection of P. falciparum in patient specimen. In the present study, we demonstrated the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid diagnostic kit in which nano-gold labeling techniques and the monoclonal antibodies against histidine-rich protein-2 of P. falciparum were used to establish two-antibody sandwich immunochromatographic assay for detecting P. falciparum. By using microscopic examination of blood smears as control, the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of Wondfo rapid diagnostic kit was determined in the prompt and accurate diagnosis of malaria. In this study, 1,558 blood samples were collected from outpatient clinics in China and detected by both Wondfo kit and microscopic examination. The Wondfo kit did not show cross-reaction with microfilaria, Toxoplasma gondii, and other parasites in the blood. The patient samples positive for rheumatoid factor, HIV, tuberculosis, and syphilis did not show false positivity when testing with Wondfo kit.

A rapid and accurate diagnosis is a prerequisite for effective treatment, especially for the potentially fatal cases of Plasmodium falciparum infection. In the present, multi-centre study, the performances of a rapid diagnostic test (NOW) Malaria) and several, commercial, PCR-based assays (AMS61, AMS42, AMS43, AMS4 and AMS45) were compared against the results of microscopical examination of bloodsmears (the current 'gold standard'). The subjects were either non-European immigrants (N=135) or international travellers (N=171). There was good concordance between the results of all the detection methods, with kappa values of >0.8. Although the NOW Malaria rapid test was both sensitive (100%) and specific (100%) in detecting P. falciparum infections, it was less specific (93.1%) and sensitive (90.7%) in identifying the other Plasmodium species. The results from the AMS61 assay, designed to detect any malarial infection, generally parallelled those of the microscopy (kappa = 0.89), giving a specificity of 98.2% and a sensitivity of 91.0%. Although the use of species-specific molecular primers to identify pure infections with P. falciparum and P. vivax gave results that were in good agreement with those of the microscopy, the subjects who had apparently pure infections with P. ovale or P. malariae were always found PCR-negative. Compared with the standard microscopy, both the NOW Malaria test and the PCR-based assays were therefore poor at identifying mixed infections. The NOW Malaria test and the PCR-based assays clearly need to be improved, particularly for the correct identification of infections with Plasmodium spp. other than P. falciparum, including mixed infections. For now, expert microscopy must remain the mainstay of the laboratory diagnosis of malaria."
CD011431,0,9803816,0,Perinatal infections--problems in developing countries.,"The transmission of infections from the biologic mother to her offspring is popularly known as perinatal infection (PI). It is not synonymous to infections during the perinatal or neonatal period. Physicians should avoid focusing attention only on the TORCH agents in the evaluation of suspected PI. Perinatal period begins from 28 weeks of gestation. Would one consider in utero infections in the first or second trimester of pregnancy as PIs? Developing countries have difficulty in collecting reliable and accurate data of PIs. These data are useful to define the magnitude of the problems, to monitor the trends, to recognise the mode of spread, and to find a solution of PIs. Most PIs are asymptomatic and diagnosis is extremely difficult. Developing countries need rapid, easy-to-operate, simple, and cheap diagnostic tools urgently. Access to health care in the remote city is limited. Newer drugs are too expensive and very few patients can benefit from these. Each developing country should prioritize its PI problems and tackle those that have serious public health problems and socio-economic impact. Most developing countries should focus on HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and HBV (hepatitis B virus) infections. Other countries where ophthalmia, malaria or tuberculosis are prevalent or endemic, should focus on these. Developing countries are more willing to allocate the budget for prevention of diseases than for treatment. There may be problem of promulgating the information on prevention of diseases because of illiteracy, multi-lingual community. Vaccines where available, should be affordable. Other effective prevention guidelines should be workable in poorer nations. The government should play an important role in enforcing immunisation program by intensive promotion program or by legislation."

Determination of the presence of sporozoites is made by observation of a sample of the final filtrate with a phase microscope. The method is simple and field adaptable, essential factors for the application of any technique to large scale field operations.

CD011431,0,16672421,0,Evaluation of a commercial latex agglutination assay for serological diagnosis of leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a febrile zoonosis of worldwide distribution. A latex agglutination assay was evaluated in two studies, the first using a panel of well-characterized sera from patients with leptospirosis and from patients with other disease states and the second, a prospective hospital-based study, evaluating sera from 186 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute febrile illness. The confirmed leptospirosis serum panel included paired acute- and convalescent-phase specimens from 40 cases, of which 34 gave positive latex tests (case sensitivity, 85%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 70 to 94%). The other diseases represented in the panel of 112 specimens from nonleptospirosis patients included autoimmune diseases, brucellosis, dengue, melioidosis, malaria, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, viral hepatitis, and a number of other viral infections. The specificity of latex agglutination using this panel was 81% (95% CI, 73 to 87%). Among the patients with acute febrile illness, there were 25 cases of leptospirosis and 161 patients with other diagnoses. The sensitivity and specificity of latex agglutination in this group were 88% (95% CI, 72 to 97%) and 98% (95% CI, 95 to 100%), respectively. In this evaluation, the two distinct groups of specimens gave similar results for sensitivity, but specificity was different in each study. The sensitivity and specificity observed for the hospital study were similar to those obtained in evaluations of other rapid tests in the same population. The results of this study suggest that multiple evaluations of new diagnostic assays should be performed, because performance characteristics may vary in different populations."
CD011431,0,19846265,1,Evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria case management in Gabon.,"A laboratory-confirmed diagnosis is the basis of malaria case management. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) create new opportunities for improved care in endemic areas. Diagnostic performance of OptiMAL-IT and Acon was assessed in comparison with microscopy at 2 sites in Gabon. Between February 2008 and January 2009, 2125 febrile children under 11 years old were diagnosed using microscopy and RDTs. Plasmodial infection was detected more frequently using Acon (27%) and OptiMAL-IT (27%) compared to microscopy (20%) (P < 0.01). Among the samples diagnosed positive by OptiMAL-IT, 78% were infected by Plasmodium falciparum, whereas 99% of positive blood smears were P. falciparum infections, 0.5% Plasmodium malariae, and 0.5% Plasmodium ovale. Both RDTs had similar sensitivity (Se) (94.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 92-96), which varied depending on the site. When parasite density was >100 p/microL, the Se of the 2 tests was >98% (95% CI, 96-100). Likewise, the negative predictive values were high and comparable (>98%). Overtreatment with antimalarial drugs was 12%. These tests should be considered as a good alternative to microscopy, allowing not only an efficient and rapid diagnosis of malaria in primary health facilities but also to aid in promoting changes for antimalarial prescription behavior."

Here we show that An. gambiae s.l. adults emerging from a highly polluted site in the city centre (Dioulassoba) have a high prevalence of DDT resistance (percentage mortality after exposure to diagnostic dose=65.8% in the dry season and 70.4% in the rainy season, respectively). An investigation into the mechanisms responsible found an unexpectedly high frequency of the 1014S kdr mutation (allele frequency=0.4), which is found at very low frequencies in An. arabiensis in the surrounding rural areas, and an increase in transcript levels of several detoxification genes, notably from the glutathione transferase and cytochrome P450 gene families. A number of ABC transporter genes were also expressed at elevated levels in the DDT resistant An. arabiensis. Unplanned urbanisation provides numerous breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The finding that Anopheles mosquitoes adapted to these urban breeding sites have a high prevalence of insecticide resistance has important implications for our understanding of the selective forces responsible for the rapid spread of insecticide resistant populations of malaria vectors in Africa."
CD011431,0,15155979,1,Evaluation of a malaria rapid diagnostic test for assessing the burden of malaria during pregnancy.,"Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy may cause placental malaria and subsequently low birth weight, primarily through the placental sequestration of infected red blood cells. Measuring the burden of malaria during pregnancy usually involves determining the prevalence of placental malaria infection through microscopic examination of placental blood films, a difficult and error-prone process. A number of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria have been developed, most of them immunochromatographic dipstick assays. However, none have been tested for the direct determination of malaria antigen in placental blood. We undertook an evaluation of the Malaria Rapid Test (MAKROmed in determining placental malaria infection. The prevalence of placental parasitemia was 22.6% by microscopy, 51.0% by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and 43.1% by RDT. When the PCR was used as the gold standard, RDTs had a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 76%. The MAKROmed RDT was highly sensitive in the detection of placental malaria, but had lower than expected specificity."

Recognizing the potential of village malaria workers to reach these communities, the US Agency for International Development-funded Malaria Control in Cambodia project used a multipronged approach to strengthen the village malaria workers network. As a result, the proportion of confirmed malaria cases treated by village malaria workers has doubled during the past 2 years, significantly increasing the numbers being properly diagnosed and treated. Key to the program's success has been the integration of village malaria workers with public health facilities, improved patient access to prompt diagnosis and treatment, and resolution of systemic barriers such as logistics for rapid diagnostic tests."

This prospective study was done on 303 admitted children of malaria. The diagnosis was done by peripheral blood smear and rapid diagnostic test. Further confirmation of severe P. vivax monoinfection was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The proportion of P. falciparum, P. vivax, and mixed (P. falciparum and P. vivax) infection was 61.01%, 33.99%, and 4.95%, respectively. Severe disease was present in 49.5% (150/303) children with malaria, with the risk greatest among P. vivax monoinfection (63.1% [65/103]) compared with P. falciparum, either alone (42.7% [79/185]; odds ratio [OR] = 2.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40-3.76], P = 0.001) or mixed infections (40% [6/15]; OR = 2.57 [95% CI = 0.88-7.48]). In children < 5 years of age, the proportion of severe malaria attributable to P. vivax rose to 67.4% (31/46) compared with 30.4% (14/46) of P. falciparum (OR = 4.7 [95% CI = 2.6-8.6], P < 0.0001) and 2.2% (1/46) of mixed infection (OR = 92 [95% CI = 24.6-339.9], P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients having severe manifestations, which included severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, abnormal bleeding was significantly high in association with P. vivax monoinfection in 0-5 year age group, while the same was significantly high in association with P. falciparum monoinfection in 5-10 year age group. Similarly P. vivax monoinfection had greatest propensity to cause multiorgan dysfunction in 0-5 year age group (34.1% [17/41], P < 0.0001) in comparison to P. falciparum monoinfection, which had similar propensity in 5-10 year age group (36.8% [35/95], P = 0.039). Plasmodium vivax monoinfection was almost equally serious to cause significant mortality in comparison to P. falciparum (case fatality rate of severe P. vivax was 3.9% versus 3.2% of severe P. falciparum malaria; P = 1.0). This study reaffirms the evidence of severe P. vivax malaria in children in Bikaner."

The assay has now been evaluated, against the usual 'gold standard', microscopy, using blood samples from 1655 individuals in five districts of Tanzania, four of which experience frequent malaria outbreaks. The aim was to verify whether Paracheck-Pf could be a reliable tool for the confirmation of malaria outbreaks in such areas. The overall measurements of the assay's performance were good, with a sensitivity of 90.0%, a specificity of 96.6%, a positive predictive value of 88.9%, and a negative predictive value of 97.0% (with an estimated malaria prevalence of 23.3%). There was, however, marked variation between the study districts, the assay's performance being relatively poor where the test had been stored for 12 months at room temperature (23.5+/-3.5 degrees C). The assay was easy to perform in the field and could clearly be a valuable tool in remote areas and in emergency situations, such as the early detection of malaria outbreaks. The cost of the assay (U.S.$0.62/test at the time of the present study) is sufficiently low that its routine use in the confirmation of P. falciparum malaria might also be cost-effective, particularly in areas where there are no facilities for microscopy and/or where the first-line treatment of malaria is based on relatively expensive artemisinin-based combinations."
CD011431,0,20663184,0,First case of detection of Plasmodium knowlesi in Spain by Real Time PCR in a traveller from Southeast Asia.,"Previously, Plasmodium knowlesi was not considered as a species of Plasmodium that could cause malaria in human beings, as it is parasite of long-tailed (Macaca fascicularis) and pig-tailed (Macaca nemestrina) macaques found in Southeast Asia. A case of infection by P. knowlesi is described in a Spanish traveller, who came back to Spain with daily fever after his last overseas travel, which was a six-month holiday in forested areas of Southeast Asia between 2008 and 2009. His P. knowlesi infection was detected by multiplex Real time quantitative PCR and confirmed by sequencing the amplified fragment. Using nested multiplex malaria PCR (reference method in Spain) and a rapid diagnostic test, the P. knowlesi infection was negative. This patient was discharged and asymptomatic when the positive result to P. knowlesi was reported. Prior to this case, there have been two more reports of European travellers with malaria caused by P. knowlesi, a Finnish man who travelled to Peninsular Malaysia during four weeks in March 2007, and a Swedish man who did a short visit to Malaysian Borneo in October 2006. Taken together with this report of P. knowlesi infection in a Spanish traveller returning from Southeast Asia, this is the third case of P. knowlesi infection in Europe, indicating that this simian parasite can infect visitors to endemic areas in Southeast Asia. This last European case is quite surprising, given that it is an untreated-symptomatic P. knowlesi in human, in contrast to what is currently known about P. knowlesi infection. Most previous reports of human P. knowlesi malaria infections were in adults, often with symptoms and relatively high parasite densities, up to the recent report in Ninh Thuan province, located in the southern part of central Vietnam, inhabited mainly by the Ra-glai ethnic minority, in which all P. knowlesi infections were asymptomatic, co-infected with P. malariae, with low parasite densities and two of the three identified cases were very young children under five years old."

Typhi flagellar H antigen. The disease often does not show a specific clinical picture, and can be confused with other febrile illness such as malaria, dengue fever and Staphylococcus aureus. To overcome the problem of cross reactivity specific epitope of the flagellar H antigen was immobilised on the testing kit strip eliminating chances of cross reactivity and false positive results thereby increasing the specificity of the test. Since the immunodiagnostic kit, uses the flagellar H antigen from bacteria present in our country, the antibodies present in the serum of patients of our country will have maximum binding affinity, enhancing the sensitivity of our test kit. The immunodiagnostic kit on analysis gave a positive result with clinically diagnosed typhoid positive patient serum and negative results were obtained with the sera of clinically diagnosed malaria, abscess of Staphylococcus aureus and Visceral leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) patients."

The present study aimed to evaluate RDTs available in Cameroon and compare their characteristics to follow the parasitological response of patients for 28 days. Malaria diagnosis was assessed in 179 febrile patients using conventional microscopy as the reference method. Parascreen detects both Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein 2 (Pf HRP-2) and Pan-specific plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) in all four human Plasmodium spp. Diaspot is based on the detection of Pf HRP-2. OptiMAL-IT (pLDH specific for P. falciparum and pLDH for all four human Plasmodium spp.) was assessed for comparison. The reliability of RDTs was evaluated by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false-positive rate, false-negative rate, and likelihood ratio. The clinical outcome of 18 children treated with atovaquone-proguanil and followed for 28 days was evaluated using microscopy and RDTs. Of 179 samples, 133 (74.3%) were pure P. falciparum-positive smears, 4 (2.2%) pure P. malariae-positive smears, and 42 (23.5%) negative smears. Parascreen and Diaspot had high sensitivity (>92%) and positive predictive values (>94%). The specificities for Parascreen and Diaspot were 81.0% and 90.5%, respectively. The false-positive rates and the false-negative rates were 19.0% and 4.5% for Parascreen and 9.5% and 8.3% for Diaspot, respectively. Most false-negatives occurred in samples with low parasitaemia (<500 asexual parasites/μL). The performance of RDTs was better at higher parasitaemia (>500 asexual parasites/μL). Four pure P. malariae were only detected by the pan-Plasmodium bands of Parascreen and OptiMAL-IT. In blood samples from patients treated and followed-up for 28 days, HRP2-based RDTs remained positive in most samples until Day 28. Despite negative smears, OptiMAL-IT remained positive in several patients until Day 7 but was negative in all patients from Day 14 onwards. RDTs can improve the management of febrile patients. The validity, ease of use, and cost of HRP2-based tests were comparable. However, one of the current weaknesses of the RDT-based strategy using the tests available in Cameroon is inadequate sensitivity for low parasitaemia. In some cases, RDT results may require correct interpretation based on clinical history, clinical examination, and microscopic diagnosis."

Participants (n =1997) presented with presumptive malaria to ten health centers in Amhara Regional State during the 2007 peak malaria season (October to December). By microscopy, 475 (23.8%) suspected malaria cases were positive, of which 57.7% were P. falciparum; 24.6% P. vivax and 17.7% mixed infections. Parascreen and Paracheck were positive for 442 (22.1%) and 277 (13.9%) febrile patients, respectively.

For Parascreen, P. vivax sensitivity was 74.4%, specificity 98.6%, PPV 76.3% and NPV 98.4%. For Paracheck, P. falciparum sensitivity was 73.7%, specificity 99.2%, PPV 95.3%, NPV 94.5%. Sensitivity was significantly higher for both tests (P<0.05) when parasite density was >100/microl of blood; in these cases Parascreen was 90.7% and 91.5% sensitive for P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively, while Paracheck was 87.9% sensitive for P. falciparum.

The main drawback of the technique is failure to identify the Plasmodium species. The purpose of this study was to attempt to remedy this problem by studying the distribution of the parasites at the bottom of the test tube. Indeed since the QBC Test is based on gradient centrifugation of blood components, the distribution of the parasites in the test tube depends on density. Blind QBC Tests were performed on specimens obtained from two different batches, i.e., one from France and the other from Burkina Faso. Distribution curves were obtained by counting the number of parasites in all microscopic fields in the five-millimeter test tube. Our findings showed differences in distribution curve depending on species. For Plasmodium falciparum, the number of parasites was nearly the same in all fields suggesting that the arrangement of the parasites in the QBC Test tube was linear. For Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, the number of parasites was markedly lower near the cap of the tube suggesting that a non-linear arrangement with a decreasing number of parasites toward the top of the tube. In 97 p. 100 of cases, we were able to propose a differential diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum versus Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale. However it was not possible to distinguish between Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. In case of mixed infection it would be difficult to distinguish Plasmodium falciparum from the other species. The ability to identify Plasmodium species would add to the advantages of the rapid and sensitive QBC Test."

HIV testing was performed on finger-prick blood samples obtained from patients after their enrollment in the trial. The specimens were tested in a serial procedure using three different rapid tests (Determine HIV-1/2 [Abbott], SD Bioline HIV-1/2 3.0 [Standard Diagnostics], and Uni-Gold HIV [Trinity Biotech]). In the event of discordant results between the Determine HIV-1/2 and SD Bioline HIV-1/2 3.0 tests, the third assay (Uni-Gold HIV) determined the final outcome. When the final outcome was positive, a second specimen was collected and tested with the same algorithm, only if a positive result was obtained with this sample the participant was informed of her positive serostatus. A total of 5,734 postenrollment specimens obtained from 1,398 women were tested. Forty-six women tested positive according to the testing algorithm performed on the first collected specimen. Confirmatory testing results obtained at the ITM confirmed that 42 women were truly infected. Two of four initial false positives tested negative upon analysis of a second blood specimen. The other two tested false positive twice using specimens collected the same day. A high percentage of specimens reactive with the Determine HIV-1/2 assay was only observed at the study site in Kampala.

This prompted us to establish a rapid and robust assay to determine deoxyhypusine and hypusine formed with the purified enzymes deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) from Plasmodium to develop a rapid screening assay for antimalarial drugs. The peptide hydrolysate obtained from hypusinylated eIF5A was analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with retention times for deoxyhypusine of 7.44 min and for hypusine of 7.30 min, respectively. The limit of detection for both compounds was 0.144 ng/μl. Determination of the specific activity of Plasmodium DOHH resulted in a twofold higher specific activity than its human counterpart. Following the iron-complexing strategy of the ferrous iron which is present in the active site of Plasmodium DOHH, a series of iron chelating compounds was tested. 2,2'-Dipyridyl and mimosine abolished DOHH activity completely while 4-oxo-piperidine-carboxylates i.e. the nitrophenylether JK8-2 and EHW 437, the oxime ether of the piperidine aldehyde, showed no inhibition although they were highly active in in vitro cultures of Plasmodium and in vivo in a rodent mouse model.

However, RDTs are susceptible to heat and humidity and variation in individual performance, which may affect their use in field settings. We evaluated sensitivity and specificity of RDTs during routine use for malaria case management in peripheral health facilities. From December 2007 to October 2008, HRP2-based ParaHIT-f RDTs were introduced in 12 facilities without available microscopy in Rufiji District, Tanzania. Health workers received a single day of instruction on how to perform an RDT and thick blood smear. Job aids, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guidelines, and national malaria treatment algorithms were reviewed. For quality assurance (QA), thick blood smears for reference microscopy were collected for 2 to 3 days per week from patients receiving RDTs; microscopy was not routinely performed at the health facilities. Slides were stained and read centrally within 72 hours of collection by a reference microscopist. When RDT and blood smear results were discordant, blood smears were read by additional reference microscopists blinded to earlier results. Facilities were supervised monthly by the district laboratory supervisor or a member of the study team. Ten thousand six hundred fifty (10,650) patients were tested with RDTs, and 51.5% (5,488/10,650) had a positive test result. Blood smear results were available for 3,914 patients, of whom 40.1% (1,577/3,914) were positive for P. falciparum malaria. Overall RDT sensitivity was 90.7% (range by facility 85.7-96.5%) and specificity was 73.5% (range 50.0-84.3%). Sensitivity increased with increasing parasite density. Successful implementation of RDTs was achieved in peripheral health facilities with adequate training and supervision. Quality assurance is essential to the adequate performance of any laboratory test. Centralized staining and reading of blood smears provided useful monitoring of RDT performance. However, this level of QA may not be sustainable nationwide."

However the parasite and vectors are showing resistance to common antimalarial drugs and insecticides. The provinces of Balochistan, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas have the highest malaria burden. Districts and agencies bordering Afghanistan and Islamic Republic of Iran account for 37% of the malaria burden with an annual parasite incidence (API) exceeding 4.5/1000 population per year. Moreover, there has been a growing risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence in areas where previously P. vivax was predominant. New and effective control tools have been introduced such as rapid diagnostic tests, artemisinin-based combination therapy and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets. This paper reports the progress achieved in the implementation of a malaria control strategy in Pakistan, shares major outstanding challenges and unearths the potential of performance-based implementation for advancing resource mobilization and collaborative partnerships."
CD011431,0,22938625,0,Surveillance considerations for malaria elimination.,"Constant malaria monitoring and surveillance systems have been highlighted as critical for malaria elimination. The absence of robust monitoring and surveillance systems able to respond to outbreaks in a timely manner undeniably contributed to the failure of the last global attempt to eradicate malaria. Today, technological advances could allow for rapid detection of focal outbreaks and improved deployment of diagnostic and treatment supplies to areas needing support. However, optimizing diffusion activities (e.g., distributing vector controls and medicines, as well as deploying behaviour change campaigns) requires networks of diverse scholars to monitor, learn, and evaluate data and multiple organizations to coordinate their intervention activities. Surveillance systems that can gather, store and process information, from communities to national levels, in a centralized, widely accessible system will allow tailoring of surveillance and intervention efforts. Different systems and, thus reactions, will be effective in different endemic, geographical or socio-cultural contexts. Investing in carefully designed monitoring technologies, built for a multiple-acter, dynamic system, will help to improve malaria elimination efforts by improving the coordination, timing, coverage, and deployment of malaria technologies."

In particular, acquired malarial infections, which sometimes become symptomatic only months or even years after soldiers return from military operations, need to be addressed. Other forces, such as the British, U.S., Australian, and Italian armed forces, reported cases of vivax malaria up to approximately 20 months after soldiers returned from military operations. The importance of a sound history and rapid diagnosis, leading to appropriate treatment, is emphasized in this case report of a 27-year-old German soldier who reported for sick call in his unit complaining of a flu-like illness, which later proved to be vivax malaria.

CD011431,0,23100347,0,"A novel, sensitive assay for high-throughput molecular detection of plasmodia for active screening of malaria for elimination.","Although malaria remains one of the leading infectious diseases in the world, the decline in malaria transmission in some area makes it possible to consider elimination of the disease. As countries approach elimination, malaria diagnosis needs to change from diagnosing ill patients to actively detecting infections in all carriers, including asymptomatic and low-parasite-load patients. However, few of the current diagnostic methods have both the throughput and the sensitivity required. We adopted a sandwich RNA hybridization assay to detect genus Plasmodium 18S rRNA directly from whole-blood samples from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax patients without RNA isolation. We tested the assay with 202 febrile patients from areas where malaria is endemic, using 20 μl of each blood sample in a 96-well plate format with a 2-day enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like work flow. The results were compared with diagnoses obtained using microscopy, a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and genus-specific real-time PCR. Our assay identified all 66 positive samples diagnosed by microscopy, including 49 poorly stored samples that underwent multiple freeze-thaw cycles due to resource limitation. The assay uncovered three false-negative samples by microscopy and four false-negative samples by RDT and agreed completely with real-time PCR diagnosis. There was no negative sample by our assay that would show a positive result when tested with other methods. The detection limit of our assay for P. falciparum was 0.04 parasite/μl. The assay's simple work flow, high throughput, and sensitivity make it suitable for active malaria screening."

Through the development of novel genetic methodologies, including a better understanding of pathogen biology, pathogenic mechanisms, advances in vaccine development, designing new therapeutic drugs, and optimization of diagnostic tools, significant infectious diseases are now better controlled. Here, we briefly describe recent reports in the literature concentrating on infectious disease control. The focus of this review is to describe the molecular methods widely used in the diagnosis, prevention, and control of infectious diseases with regard to the innovation of molecular techniques. Since the list of pathogenic microorganisms is extensive, we emphasize some of the major human infectious diseases (AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, rotavirus, herpes virus, viral hepatitis, and dengue fever). As a consequence of these developments, infectious diseases will be more accurately and effectively treated; safe and effective vaccines are being developed and rapid detection of infectious agents now permits countermeasures to avoid potential outbreaks and epidemics.

Although continued molecular surveillance of malaria parasites is important to early identify emerging anti-malarial drug resistance, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain parasite samples from ongoing studies, such as routine drug efficacy trials. To explore other sources of parasite DNA, this study was conducted to examine if sufficient DNA could be successfully extracted from malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), used and collected as part of routine case management services in health facilities, and thus forming the basis for molecular analyses, surveillance and quality control (QC) testing of RDTs."

There is a need for appropriate multi-analyte diagnostics capable of differentiating between diseases that cause similar clinical symptoms. The work presented here was part of a larger effort to develop a microfluidic point-of-care system, the DxBox, for sample-to-result differential diagnosis of infections that present with high rapid-onset fever. Here we describe a platform that detects disease-specific antigens and IgM antibodies. The disposable microfluidic cards are based on a flow-through membrane immunoassay carried out on porous nitrocellulose, which provides rapid diffusion for short assay times and a high surface area for visual detection of colored assay spots. Fluid motion and on-card valves were driven by a pneumatic system and we present designs for using pneumatic control to carry out assay functions. Pneumatic actuation, while having the potential advantage of inexpensive and robust hardware, introduced bubbles that interfered with fluidic control and affected assay results. The cards performed all sample preparation steps including plasma filtration from whole blood, sample and reagent aliquoting for the two parallel assays, sample dilution, and IgG removal for the IgM assays. We demonstrated the system for detection of the malarial pfHRPII antigen (spiked) and IgM antibodies to Salmonella Typhi LPS (patient plasma samples). All reagents were stored on card in dry form; only the sample and buffer were required to run the tests. Here we detail the development of this platform and discuss its strengths and weaknesses."

The extraction cassette consists of a small-diameter tube containing a series of preloaded processing solutions separated by mineral oil valves. Nickel(II) nitrilotriacetic acid-functionalized magnetic particles are added to a parasite-spiked sample contained within the loading chamber of the device for capture of pfHRPII. The biomarker-bound magnetic particles are then entrained by an external magnetic field and transported through three wash solutions. Processing removes sample interfering agents, and the biomarker target is concentrated in the final chamber for subsequent analysis. At parasitemias of 200 parasites/μL, purification and concentration of pfHRPII with extraction efficiencies in excess of 70% total protein target are achieved. The concentration of nonspecific protein interfering agents was reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude in the final extracted sample without the need for hours of processing time and specialized laboratory equipment. We have demonstrated an application of this low-resource technology by coupling extraction and concentration of pfHRPII within the cassette to a commonly employed rapid diagnostic test. Sample preprocessing improved the visual limit of detection of this test by over 8-fold, suggesting that the combination of both low-resource technologies could prove to be useful in malaria eradication efforts."

CD011431,0,23349994,0,Real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp) for the species-specific identification of Plasmodium vivax.,"Plasmodium vivax infections remain a major source of malaria-related morbidity and mortality. Early and accurate diagnosis is an integral component of effective malaria control programs. Conventional molecular diagnostic methods provide accurate results but are often resource-intensive, expensive, have a long turnaround time and are beyond the capacity of most malaria-endemic countries. Our laboratory has recently developed a new platform called RealAmp, which combines loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with a portable tube scanner real-time isothermal instrument for the rapid detection of malaria parasites. Here we describe new primers for the detection of P. vivax using the RealAmp method. Three pairs of amplification primers required for this method were derived from a conserved DNA sequence unique to the P. vivax genome. The amplification was carried out at 64°C using SYBR Green or SYTO-9 intercalating dyes for 90 minutes with the tube scanner set to collect fluorescence signals at 1-minute intervals. Clinical samples of P. vivax and other human-infecting malaria parasite species were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the primers by comparing with an 18S ribosomal RNA-based nested PCR as the gold standard. The new set of primers consistently detected laboratory-maintained isolates of P. vivax from different parts of the world. The primers detected P. vivax in the clinical samples with 94.59% sensitivity (95% CI: 87.48-98.26%) and 100% specificity (95% CI: 90.40-100%) compared to the gold standard nested-PCR method. The new primers also proved to be more sensitive than the published species-specific primers specifically developed for the LAMP method in detecting P. vivax."

CD011431,0,11487366,1,Malaria diagnosis and treatment under the strategy of the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI): relevance of laboratory support from the rapid immunochromatographic tests of ICT Malaria P.f/P.v and OptiMal.,"The algorithm developed for the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) provides guidelines for the treatment of paediatric malaria. In areas where malaria is endemic, for example, the IMCI strategy may indicate that children who present with fever, a recent history of fever and/or pallor should receive antimalarial chemotherapy. In many holo-endemic areas, it is unclear whether laboratory tests to confirm that such signs are the result of malaria would be very relevant or useful. Children from a holo-endemic region of Tanzania were therefore checked for malarial parasites by microscopy and by using two rapid immunochromatographic tests (RIT) for the diagnosis of malaria (ICT Malaria P.f/P.v and OptiMal. At the time they were tested, each of these children had been targeted for antimalarial treatment (following the IMCI strategy) because of fever and/or pallor. Only 70% of the 395 children classified to receive antimalarial drugs by the IMCI algorithm had malarial parasitaemias (68.4% had Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites, 1.3% only P. falciparum gametocytes, 0.3% P. ovale and 0.3% P. malariae). As indicators of P. falciparum trophozoites in the peripheral blood, fever had a sensitivity of 93.0% and a specificity of 15.5% whereas pallor had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 50.8%. The RIT both had very high corresponding sensitivities (of 100.0% for the ICT and 94.0% for OptiMal) but the specificity of the ICT (74.0%) was significantly lower than that for OptiMal (100.0%). Fever and pallor were significantly associated with the P. falciparum asexual parasitaemias that equalled or exceeded the threshold intensity (2000/microl) that has the optimum sensitivity and specificity for the definition of a malarial episode. Diagnostic likelihood ratios (DLR) showed that a positive result in the OptiMal test (DLR = infinity) was a better indication of malaria than a positive result in the ICT (DLR = 3.85). In fact, OptiMal had diagnostic reliability (0.93) which approached that of an ideal test and, since it only detects live parasites, OptiMal is superior to the ICT in monitoring therapeutic responses. Although the RIT may seem attractive for use in primary health facilities because relatively inexperienced staff can perform them, the high cost of these tests is prohibitive. In holo-endemic areas, use of RIT or microscopical examination of bloodsmears may only be relevant when malaria needs to be excluded as a cause of illness (e.g. prior to treatment with toxic or expensive drugs, or during malaria epidemics). Wherever the effective drugs for the first-line treatment of malaria are cheap (e.g. chloroquine and Fansidar), treatment based on clinical diagnosis alone should prove cost-saving in health facilities without microscopy."

Nowadays, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is documented in Egypt mainly in Al Agamy, Alexandria. Another case of infantile visceral leishmaniasis was identified in an adult farmer (unusual host) in Banha. Other studies all over Egypt (based on clinical and or serological diagnosis rather than demonstration of the parasites) raised the possibility of adult affection with visceral leishmaniasis. The point is that visceral leishmaniasis, shares many clinical manifestations with other diseases known in Egypt as schistosomiasis mansoni, hepatic amoebiasis, toxoplasmosis, and malaria. In the present study, out of 22 human cases with hypersplenism and suggesting manifestations, four gave seropositivity for VL, by the indirect haemagglutination tests (128 & more). Two of these four patients gave seropositivity by dot-ELISA (1:8000). Amastigotes of Leishmania parasite were demonstrated in the splenic smears obtained during splenectomy. One culture obtained from these two cases grew promastigotes. Typing is ongoing.

CD011431,0,20298268,0,Multiplex real-time PCR for the diagnosis of malaria: correlation with microscopy.,"Malaria is generally diagnosed by microscopy and rapid antigen testing. Molecular methods become more widely used. In the present study, the contribution of a quantitative multiplex malaria PCR was investigated. We assessed: (i) the agreement between PCR-based identification and microscopy and (ii) the correlation between the parasite load as determined by quantitative PCR and by microscopy. For 83 patients positive by microscopy for Plasmodium spp., the first EDTA-blood sample was tested by multiplex PCR to confirm smear-based species identification. Parasite load was assessed daily using both microscopy and PCR. Among the 83 patients tested, one was positive by microscopy only and 82 were positive by microscopy and PCR. Agreement between microscopy and PCR for the identification at the species level was 89% (73/82). Six of the nine discordant results corresponded to co-infections by two or three species and were attributed to inaccurate morphological identification of mixed cases. The parasite load generally decreased rapidly after treatment had been started, with similar decay curves being obtained using both microscopy and PCR. Our PCR proved especially useful for identifying mixed infections. The quantification obtained by PCR closely correlated with microscopy-based quantification and could be useful for monitoring treatment efficacy, at least in clinical trials."

Relative to the results obtained with GTF, the QBC technique had a sensitivity and specificity of 87.2% and 95.0%, respectively; concordance between the tests was 93.1%. The median time-to-positive diagnosis with the QBC technique (1.12 min) was 11% of that with GTF. The distribution of different developmental stages of Plasmodium vivax parasites was also examined in the centrifuged QBC tubes: all stages except schizonts could be found in the lower part of the platelet zone (the interphase between the monocyte and platelet layers), especially ring forms."
CD011431,0,19419588,0,Fighting malaria in Madhya Pradesh (Central India): are we losing the battle?,"Malaria control in Madhya Pradesh is complex because of vast tracts of forest with tribal settlement. Fifty four million individuals of various ethnic origins, accounting for 8% of the total population of India, contributed 30% of total malaria cases, 60% of total falciparum cases and 50% of malaria deaths in the country. Ambitious goals to control tribal malaria by launching ""Enhanced Malaria Control Project"" (EMCP) by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), with the World Bank assistance, became effective in September 1997 in eight north Indian states. Under EMCP, the programme used a broader mix of new interventions, i.e. insecticide-treated bed nets, spraying houses with effective residual insecticides, use of larvivorous fishes, rapid diagnostic tests for prompt diagnosis, treatment of the sick with effective radical treatment and increased public awareness and IEC. However, the challenge is to scale up these services.A retrospective analysis of data on malaria morbidity and associated mortality reported under the existing surveillance system of the Madhya Pradesh (Central India) for the years 1996-2007 was carried out to determine the impact of EMCP on malaria morbidity and associated mortality. Analysis revealed that despite the availability of effective intervention tools for the prevention and control of malaria, falciparum malaria remains uncontrolled and deaths due to malaria have increased. Precisely, the aim of this epidemiological analysis is to draw lessons applicable to all international aid efforts, bureaucracy, policy makers and programme managers in assessing its project performance as a new Global Malaria Action Plan is launched with ambitious goal of reducing malaria and its elimination by scaling up the use of existing tools."
CD011431,0,9060222,0,An evaluation of clinical indicators for severe paediatric illness.,"To help reduce paediatric morbidity and mortality in the developing world, WHO has developed a diagnostic and treatment algorithm that targets the principal causes of death in children, which include acute respiratory infection, malaria, measles, diarrhoeal disease, and malnutrition. With this algorithm, known as the Sick Child Charts, severely ill children are rapidly identified, through the presence of any one of 13 signs indicative of severe illness, and referred for more intensive health care. These signs are the inability to drink, abnormal mental status (abnormally sleepy), convulsions, wasting, oedema, chest wall retraction, stridor, abnormal skin turgor, repeated vomiting, stiff neck, tender swelling behind the ear, pallor of the conjunctiva, and corneal ulceration. The usefulness of these signs, both in current clinical practice and within the optimized context of the Sick Child Chart algorithm in a rural district of western Kenya, was evaluated. We found that 27% of children seen in outpatient clinics had one or more of these signs and that pallor and chest wall retraction were the signs most likely to be associated with hospital admission (odds ratio (OR) = 8.6 and 5.3, respectively). Presentation with any of these signs led to a 3.2 times increased likelihood of admission, although 54% of hospitalized children had no such signs and 21% of children sent home from the outpatient clinic had at least one sign. Among inpatients, 58% of all children and 89% of children who died had been admitted with a sign. Abnormal mental status was the sign most highly associated with death (OR = 59.6), followed by poor skin turgor (OR = 5.6), pallor (OR = 4.3), repeated vomiting (OR = 3.6), chest wall retraction (OR = 2.7), and oedema (OR = 2.4). Overall, the mortality risk associated with having at least one sign was 6.5 times higher than that for children without any sign. While these signs are useful in identifying a subset of children at high risk of death, their validation in other settings is needed. The training and supervision of health workers to identify severely ill children should continue to be given high priority because of the benefits, such as reduction of childhood mortality."

CD011431,0,8730315,0,Multiple dose pharmacokinetics of oral artemisinin and comparison of its efficacy with that of oral artesunate in falciparum malaria patients.,"The study compared the clinical efficacy and safety of oral artemisinin and oral artesunate as well as artemisinin pharmacokinetics during and after resolution of falciparum malaria. Forty adults with symptomatic falciparum malaria were allocated at random to treatment with either oral artemisinin (500 mg single dose on day 1 followed by 250 mg twice daily for 4 d and then another 500 mg single dose on day 6) or with oral artesunate (100 mg single dose on day 1 followed by 50 mg twice daily for 5 d). Patients were admitted to hospital at the Kibaha Designated District Hospital, Kibaha, Tanzania for the duration of treatment. The patients were seen once weekly for 3 more weeks. The time to parasite clearance (PCT) after oral artesunate (26.4 +/- 3.6 h) was shorter (P = 0.002) than after artemisinin (31 +/- 3.6 h). The fever subsidence time (FST) after oral artesunate (18.9 +/- 4.0 h) was also shorter (P = 0.04) than after artemisinin (21.8 +/- 4.6 h). Parasites were detected in 4 (20%) and 7 (35%) patients after completing treatment with artesunate and artemisinin respectively. In these patients the parasitaemia reappeared at the 3rd or 4th week of follow-up. Standard haematology, blood biochemistry and urinalysis, performed before drug intake and again on days 6 and 14, were normal. No clinical abnormality was observed during the study period. Artemisinin plasma concentrations, determined by high performance liquid chromatography with post-column derivatization and detection by ultraviolet light, were followed up to 8 h after drug administration on days 1 and 6. Artemisinin absorption was rapid, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) being attained at about 3 h. Artemisinin areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the Cmax values were about 6 times higher after the first dose on day 1 than on day 6. This decrease in artemisinin plasma concentration is suggestive of an increase in metabolic capacity due to pronounced autoinduction."

But the pressing need, in the face of increasing global mortality and general lack of progress in malaria control, is research into the best methods of deploying and using existing approaches, particularly insecticide-treated mosquito nets, rapid methods of diagnosis, and artemisinin-based combination treatments. Evidence on these approaches should provide national governments and international donors with the cost-benefit information that would justify much-needed increases in global support for appropriate and effective malaria control."

Here, an immunosensor for the photometric detection of malaria, the malaria-detecting immunosensor (MDI), is developed to detect Plasmodium falciparum malarial antibodies in human blood. The method uses the principle of laser light-scattering by latex bead agglutinates in media monitored by a light-detecting device. Agglutination is induced by mixing antigen-coated latex beads with serum antibodies. Immunoreactions are measured in terms of the Tyndall effect in the transmitted beam detected by photodiodes. MDI sensitivity and specificity are compared with the results of enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay and laser light-scattering immunoassay techniques, which show that it is a good and sensitive monitoring device."

CD011431,0,16505556,1,Evaluation of different methods for diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria.,"Rapid diagnosis is a prerequisite for institution of effective treatment and reducing the mortality and morbidity of falciparum malaria. This study was taken up to compare the efficacy of various rapid methods viz, acridine orange, Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein II antigen detection and Field's stain with traditional microscopy i.e, Leishman stain for diagnosing falciparum malaria. Thick and thin blood films of 443 consecutive patients with history of fever with chills and rigors were examined by Leishman and Field's method. Acridine orange stained wet mounts of blood were examined under fluorescence microscopy. All films were examined by two independent microbiologists. Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein II antigen was detected using commercially available kit, Paracheck Pf. Out of the 443 subjects examined for P.falciparum 18.28% were detected by Leishman stain, 6.32% by Field's stain, 18.28% by acridine orange and 18.1% by antigen based technique. Field's stain missed 53 (65.4%), while Paracheck Pf was negative in 6(7.4%) of the Leishman positive samples. All Field's stain and acridine orange positives were positive by Leishman, but five Paracheck Pf positives were negative. Leishman stain is cost effective but if facilities are available one should use acridine orange for screening. The antigen detection kits are rapid, simple and are useful but to rule out false negatives in clinically suspected cases, Leishman stain is reliable."

CD011431,0,11937424,0,Multiplexed immunoassays by flow cytometry for diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases in resource-poor settings.,"An accurate, rapid and cost-effective diagnosis is the cornerstone of efficient clinical and epidemiological management of infections. Here we discuss the relevance of an emerging technology, multiplexed immunoassays read by flow cytometry, for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In these assays, multiple fluorescent microspheres, conjugated to different antigens or antibodies, constitute the solid phase for detecting antibodies or antigens in biological samples. These assays seem to be more sensitive than traditional immunoassays, have a high throughput capacity, and provide a wide analytical dynamic range. Additionally, they have multiplexing ability-ie, they are capable of measuring multiple antibodies or antigens simultaneously. We discuss four different areas where this technology could make an impact in resource-poor settings: (i) infections causing rash and fever in children; (ii) sero-epidemiological studies on vaccine-preventable diseases; (iii) management of genital ulcers and vaginal discharge; and (iv) screening of infections in blood banking. We predict a widespread use for a new breed of small, affordable, practical flow cytometers as field instruments for replacing ELISA and RIA tests, which will also be capable of doing cellular immunological tests such as CD4+ T-cell enumeration and Plasmodium falciparum detection in whole blood."
CD011431,0,12530504,0,Feasibility and limitations of acridine orange fluorescence technique using a Malaria Diagnosis Microscope in Myanmar.,"We studied parasite detectability in thick films by an acridine orange fluorescence technique (AO) to test its applicability and the use of a Malaria Diagnosis Microscope (MDM)-ESL in the detection of parasites, compared to the conventional Giemsa staining method. This study was conducted on 1,390 clinically suspected malaria cases of Thaton township, Myanmar. We found sensitivities of 82.8% for Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) and 100% for Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and specificities of 97.1% for P. falciparum and 98.6% for P. vivax. AO had a higher sensitivity than Giemsa-stained films at low levels of parasitemia (< 1,000/microl). AO showed lower sensitivity and higher specificity than the Giemsa method at parasite levels of more than 1,000/microl. The results of using the AO method, achieved by both novice and experienced observers, showed no significant difference and required less practice to perform the test as well as to identify the parasite. The acridine orange fluorescence technique using a malaria diagnosis microscope MDM-ESL series is simple, rapid and cost effective. The microscope is conveniently operable using standard AC power or a 12-V DC car battery, and it is easily convertible to a conventional biological microscope. With the exception of species differentiation, which is not possible with this method, this method would be appropriate for both clinical and epidemiological studies."

CD011431,0,23208885,0,Is serial testing required to diagnose imported malaria in the era of rapid diagnostic tests?,"Exclusion of malaria traditionally requires three negative serial thick and thin blood films. However, many clinical laboratories now routinely perform rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in addition to blood films when malaria is suspected. We sought to determine whether serial testing is necessary in this setting. We examined 388 cases of malaria diagnosed during 1999-2010 at three laboratories in Melbourne, Australia. For each case, we ascertained whether the diagnosis was made on initial or follow-up testing. Nine cases (3.5%) were diagnosed after a negative initial blood film and RDT: 7 Plasmodium vivax, 1 P. ovale, and 1 P. falciparum. Of four case-patients with P. vivax in which clinical data were available, all had recent exposure to antimalarial medication. Our data suggest that among patients who have not received recent anti-malarial therapy, and when RDTs are performed and blood films are prepared, most malaria diagnoses are made by using the first set of tests."

In the field of Plasmodium research, many of the parasite genomes that one might wish to study in a high throughput manner are not laboratory clones, but clinical isolates. One of the key limitations to the use of clinical samples in CGH, however, is the miniscule amounts of genomic DNA available. Here we describe the successful application of multiple displacement amplification (MDA), a non-PCR-based amplification method that exhibits clear advantages over all other currently available methods. Using MDA, CGH was performed on a panel of NF54 and IT/FCR3 clones, identifying previously published deletions on chromosomes 2 and 9 as well as polymorphism in genes associated with disease pathology."

CD011431,0,15331827,0,Urbanization in sub-saharan Africa and implication for malaria control.,"Malaria not only remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, but it also impedes socioeconomic development, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Rapid and unprecedented urbanization, going hand-in-hand with often declining economies, might have profound implications for the epidemiology and control of malaria, as the relative disease burden increases among urban dwellers. Reviewing the literature and using a modeling approach, we find that entomologic inoculation rates in cities range from 0 to 54 per year, depending on the degree of urbanization, the spatial location within a city, and overall living conditions. Using the latest United Nations figures on urbanization prospects, nighttime light remotely sensed images, and the ""Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa"" results on climate suitability for stable malaria transmission, we estimate that 200 million people (24.6% of the total African population) currently live in urban settings where they are at risk of contracting the disease. Importantly, the estimated total surface area covered by these urban settings is only approximately 1.1-1.6% of the total African surface. Considering different plausible scenarios, we estimate an annual incidence of 24.8-103.2 million cases of clinical malaria attacks among urban dwellers in Africa. These figures translate to 6-28% of the estimated global annual disease incidence. Against this background, basic health care delivery systems providing early diagnosis and early treatment and preventive actions through mother and child health programs and the promotion of insecticide-treated bed nets for the rapidly growing numbers of the urban poor must be improved alongside well-tailored and integrated malaria control strategies. We propose environmental management and larviciding within well-specified productive sites as a main feature for such an integrated control approach. Mitigation of the current burden of malaria in urban African settings, in turn, is a necessity for stimulating environmentally and socially sustainable development."

CD011431,0,22142790,0,Improving malaria control in West Africa: interruption of transmission as a paradigm shift.,"With the paradigm shift from the reduction of morbidity and mortality to the interruption of transmission, the focus of malaria control broadens from symptomatic infections in children ≤5 years of age to include asymptomatic infections in older children and adults. In addition, as control efforts intensify and the number of interventions increases, there will be decreases in prevalence, incidence and transmission with additional decreases in morbidity and mortality. Expected secondary consequences of these changes include upward shifts in the peak ages for infection (parasitemia) and disease, increases in the ages for acquisition of antiparasite humoral and cellular immune responses and increases in false-negative blood smears and rapid diagnostic tests. Strategies to monitor these changes must include: (1) studies of the entire population (that are not restricted to children ≤5 or ≤10 years of age), (2) study sites in both cities and rural areas (because of increasing urbanization across sub-Saharan Africa) and (3) innovative strategies for surveillance as the prevalence of infection decreases and the frequency of false-negative smears and rapid diagnostic tests increases."
CD011431,0,19384681,0,Internally displaced human resources for health: villager health worker partnerships to scale up a malaria control programme in active conflict areas of eastern Burma.,"Approaches to expand malaria control interventions in areas of active conflict are urgently needed. Despite international agreement regarding the imperative to control malaria in eastern Burma, there are currently no large-scale international malaria programmes operating in areas of active conflict. A local ethnic health department demonstrated that village health workers are capable of implementing malaria control interventions among internally displaced persons (IDPs). This paper describes how these internally displaced villagers facilitated rapid expansion of the programme. Clinic health workers received training in malaria diagnosis and treatment, vector control and education at training sites along the border. After returning to programme areas inside Burma, they trained villagers to perform an increasingly comprehensive set of interventions. This iterative training strategy to increase human resources for health permitted the programme to expand from 3000 IDPs in 2003 to nearly 40,000 in 2008. It was concluded that IDPs are capable of delivering essential malaria control interventions in areas of active conflict in eastern Burma. In addition, health workers in this area have the capacity to train community members to take on implementation of such interventions. This iterative strategy may provide a model to improve access to care in this population and in other conflict settings."
CD011431,0,21910780,0,Malaria rapid diagnostic tests in elimination settings--can they find the last parasite?,"Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria have improved the availability of parasite-based diagnosis throughout the malaria-endemic world. Accurate malaria diagnosis is essential for malaria case management, surveillance, and elimination. RDTs are inexpensive, simple to perform, and provide results in 15-20 min. Despite high sensitivity and specificity for Plasmodium falciparum infections, RDTs have several limitations that may reduce their utility in low-transmission settings: they do not reliably detect low-density parasitaemia (≤200 parasites/μL), many are less sensitive for Plasmodium vivax infections, and their ability to detect Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae is unknown. Therefore, in elimination settings, alternative tools with higher sensitivity for low-density infections (e.g. nucleic acid-based tests) are required to complement field diagnostics, and new highly sensitive and specific field-appropriate tests must be developed to ensure accurate diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. As malaria transmission declines, the proportion of low-density infections among symptomatic and asymptomatic persons is likely to increase, which may limit the utility of RDTs. Monitoring malaria in elimination settings will probably depend on the use of more than one diagnostic tool in clinical-care and surveillance activities, and the combination of tools utilized will need to be informed by regular monitoring of test performance through effective quality assurance."

Diagnostic tools based on the dipstick principle for the detection of plasmodial histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2) and parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), respectively, have become available for the qualitative detection of P. falciparum malaria. In order to evaluate two of the currently available assays, specimens from 231 patients were screened during a prospective multicenter study. Among the screened specimens, samples from 53 patients (22.9%) were positive for P. falciparum malaria by microscopy and/or PCR. While the test kit based on the detection of HRP-2 performed with a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 98.3%, the kit for the detection of pLDH showed a sensitivity of 88.5% and a specificity of 99.4%.

The biotinylated PCR products were then identified by PCR-colorimetric Covalink NH microwell plate hybridization (CMPH) using species-specific phosphorylated probes covalently bound to a pretreated polystyrene surface. The results from PCR-CMPH showed high specificity, and for 47 of the 56 patients (84%), microscopy and PCR-CMPH results were in agreement. Discordant results were reevaluated with microscopy examination, other molecular methods, and DNA sequencing. Except for one patient, discrepancies were resolved in favor of PCR-CMPH: three mixed infections were detected, four species identification errors were corrected, and two negative results were shown to be positive.

It employs stable reagents and inexpensive equipment, making it suitable for routine epidemiological use."
CD011431,0,23413992,0,Rapid diagnostic tests for non-malarial febrile illness in the tropics.,"The recent roll-out of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria has highlighted the decreasing proportion of malaria-attributable illness in endemic areas. Unfortunately, once malaria is excluded, there are few accessible diagnostic tools to guide the management of severe febrile illnesses in low resource settings. This review summarizes the current state of RDT development for several key infections, including dengue fever, enteric fever, leptospirosis, brucellosis, visceral leishmaniasis and human African trypanosomiasis, and highlights many remaining gaps. Most RDTs for non-malarial tropical infections currently rely on the detection of host antibodies against a single infectious agent. The sensitivity and specificity of host-antibody detection tests are both inherently limited. Moreover, prolonged antibody responses to many infections preclude the use of most serological RDTs for monitoring response to treatment and/or for diagnosing relapse. Considering these limitations, there is a pressing need for sensitive pathogen-detection-based RDTs, as have been successfully developed for malaria and dengue. Ultimately, integration of RDTs into a validated syndromic approach to tropical fevers is urgently needed. Related research priorities are to define the evolving epidemiology of fever in the tropics, and to determine how combinations of RDTs could be best used to improve the management of severe and treatable infections requiring specific therapy."
CD011431,0,10489737,1,Evaluation of a rapid antigen capture assay for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria.,"A study was carried out to evaluate the accuracy of a dipstick antigen capture assay for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein II antigen (Pf HRP-II) in peripheral blood to diagnose P. falciparum malaria. The sensitivity and specificity of the test was found to be 97 and 100 per cent respectively. The persistence of the antigen varied from 5 to 15 days after initiation of antimalarial therapy. The assay was simple to perform, rapid and easy to interpret. However, infection due to other species of human malaria parasites cannot be detected by this dipstick assay. Use of more sensitive technique like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) would help in diagnosing cases with low parasitaemia and infection due to other plasmodial species."

CD011431,0,19475137,0,Resonance Raman microscopy in combination with partial dark-field microscopy lights up a new path in malaria diagnostics.,"Our goal is to produce a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool for malaria using resonance Raman spectroscopy to detect small inclusions of haemozoin in Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells. In pursuit of this aim we serendipitously discovered a partial dark-field effect generated by our experimental setup, which helps identify in thick blood films potential parasites that are normally difficult to see with conventional bright-field microscopy. The haemozoin deposits 'light up' and these can be selectively targeted with the Raman microscope to confirm the presence or absence of haemozoin by the strong 1569 cm(-1) band, which is a marker for haemozoin. With newly developed imaging Raman microscopes incorporating ultra-sensitive rapid readout CCDs it is possible to obtain spectra with a good signal-to-noise ratio in 1 second. Moreover, images from a smear of potentially infected cells can be recorded and analysed with multivariate methods. The reconstructed images show what appear to be sub-micron-inclusions of haemozoin in some cells indicating that the technique has potential to identify low pigmented forms of the parasite including early trophozoite-stage infected cells. Further work is required to unambiguously confirm the presence of such forms through systematic staining but the results are indeed promising and may lead to the development of a new Raman-based malaria diagnostic."
CD011431,0,9091864,0,[Malaria: what treatment today?].,"Morbidity and mortality due to malaria remains an important health problem for travelers visiting endemic zones. In this population, typical episodes of chills and fever followed by diaphoresis are not always observed; inaugural signs may limited to low-grade fever accompanying digestive disorders. Early diagnosis is nevertheless essential to prevent progression to acute pernicious malaria. Blood smears, quantitative butty coat (QBC) test or the Parasight test can give rapid diagnosis. Chloroquine is the drug of choice for Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale or P. Malariae infection, but chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum is widespread in tropical zones and resistant P. vivax has been reported in Indonesia. Currently, halofantrine is the best treatment for P. falciparum infection, although cardiac toxicity may occur in patients with a long QT on the electrocardiogram. Mefloquine can be alternative. The sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination is also used in many tropical zones because of its low cost and availability, but many resistant strains of P. falciparum have been identified. Use of quinine is also widespread in tropical zones. This basic antimalarial is rapidly effective but is also rapidly eliminated, necessitating repeated oral doses. Intramuscular injection may provoke necrosis. The main indication for quinine is acute pernicious P. falciparum malaria, but the drug is also used for simple episodes of fever in many tropical zones. Symptomatic care including fluid replacement, oxygen, transfusion, diuretics, respiratory assistance and dialysis may also be required in some cases. Use of corticosteroids or exsanguinotransfusion remains a question of debate. When administered rapidly, fever should regress within a few days. Neurological sequellae are exceptional after acute pernicious malaria in adults but may occur approximately 5% of children, emphasizing the importance of associating chemoprophylaxis and protection against insect bites. There has been much publicity concerning a vaccine, but results to date have been disappointing."

The presently available rapid tests are not suitable for diagnosis of malaria tertiana. Malaria tertiana acquired in Southeast Asia carries a considerable risk of resistance to chloroquine. In this situation mefloquine is used in first place at total dose of 1000-1500 mg. Relapse of malaria tertiana even after primaquine have been described in travellers returning from the tropics. The efficacy of primaquine can be improved by raising the dose. Hereby an increased risk of hemolysis in concomitant glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency and, more commonly, gastrointestinal side effects have to be considered."

Whereas HIV infection may alter the natural history of parasitic diseases, impede rapid diagnosis or reduce the efficacy of antiparasitic treatment, parasitoses may facilitate the infection with HIV as well as the progression from asymptomatic infection to AIDS. We review data on known interactions for malaria, leishmaniasis, Human African Trypanosomiasis, Chagas' disease, onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis and intestinal helminthiases. The common immunopathogenetic basis for the deleterious effects parasitic diseases may have on the natural history of HIV infection seems to be a particular type of chronic immune activation and a preferential activation of the T helper (Th)2 type of help. Control of parasitic diseases should complement the tools currently used in combating the HIV pandemic."

However, the economic effects of these tests may vary. Data on costs were collected from 259 patients in 6 health facilities by using exit and in-charge interviews and record reviews during a trial of RDT rollout in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The RDTs decreased patient expenditure on drugs (savings = U.S. $0.36; P = 0.002) and provider drug costs (savings = U.S. $0.43; P = 0.034) compared with control facilities. However, RDT introduction did not significantly reduce patients' overall expenditures (U.S. $1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = $0.76-$1.36 versus U.S. $1.33 95% CI = $0.99-$1.77) and may increase total provider costs (U.S. $3.63, 95% CI = $3.40-$3.89 versus U.S. $2.32, 95% CI = $1.99-$2.69) compared with control facilities. Clinician's compliance with test results was higher with RDTs than with routine microscopy (95% versus 82%; P = 0.002). The RDTs reduced drug costs in this setting but did not offset the cost of the tests, although they also resulted in non-monetary benefits, including improved management of patients and increased compliance with test results."

CD011431,0,14513934,0,Rapid immunochromatographic diagnosis and Rolling Back Malaria--experiences from an African control program.,"Malaria is a re-emerging disease in much of Africa. In response, the World Health Organization launched the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) initiative. One of six key principles adopted is the early detection of malaria cases. However, the importance of definitive diagnosis and potential value of field deployment of rapid malaria tests in RBM has been largely ignored. The Lowveld Region of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, is home to a predominantly non-immune population, of approximately 850000 inhabitants, who are at risk of seasonal Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Malaria treatment in this area is usually only initiated on detection of malaria parasites in the peripheral bloodstream, as many other rickettsial and viral febrile illness mimic malaria. The malaria control programme traditionally relied on light microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick blood films for malaria diagnosis. This review summarizes operational research findings that led to the introduction of rapid malaria card tests for primary diagnosis of malaria throughout the Mpumalanga malaria area. Subsequent operational research and extensive experience over a four-year period since introducing the ICT Malaria Pf test appears to confirm the local appropriateness of this diagnostic modality. A laboratory is not required and clinic staff are empowered to make a prompt definitive diagnosis, limiting delays in initiating correct therapy. The simple, accurate and rapid non-microscopic means now available for diagnosing malaria could play an important role in Rolling Back Malaria in selected areas."
CD011431,0,15672556,0,Drug resistance in malaria.,"Ever since the discovery of the first case of chloroquine resistance along the Thai-Combodian border in the late 1950s, Southeast Asia has played an important role as a focus for the development of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. Although the first case of quinine resistance had been reported much earlier from South America, the onset of chloroquine resistance marked the beginning of a new chapter in the history of malaria in Southeast Asia and by 1973 chloroquine finally had to be replaced by the combination of sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine (SP) as first line drug for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Thailand and more than 10 African countries have also switched their first line drug to SP. In 1985, eventually SP was replaced by mefloquine. The rapid development of resistance to this new drug leads to the introduction of artemisinin as a combination drug in the mid-1990s. It is mandatory to mention here that therapeutic regimens for prevention and treatment of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum are associated with higher costs and side-effects compared to chloroquine. Additionally, some of these alternative treatments are associated with more side-effects, take longer time for cure and are more difficult to comply with than chloroquine. Urgent efforts are needed to identify effective, affordable, alternative antimalarial regimens. Molecular markers for antimalarial resistance have been identified, including pfmdr-1 and pfcrt polymorphisms associated with chloroquine resistance and dhfr and dhps polymorphisms associated with SP resistance. Polymorphisms in pfmdr-1 may also be associated with resistance to chloroquine, mefloquine and artemisinin. Use of such genetic information for the early detection of resistance foci and future monitoring of drug resistant malaria is a potentially useful epidemiological tool, in conjunction with the conventional in vitro and in vivo drug sensitivity assessments. The purpose of this review is to describe the state of knowledge regarding drug resistant malaria and to outline the changing patterns of drug resistance including its determinants, current status in diverse geographical areas, molecular markers and their implications to limit the advent, spread and intensification of drug resistant malaria."

In addition to 176 slide-proven imported cases of Plasmodium vivax, 94 other persons reactive serologically but no patent parasitemia was found. Slide and serologic results indicated that the dominant malaria species involved was P. vivax. Seven patients who were both serologically and parasite negative when first tested subsequently reported with patent parasitemia and high antibody titer. One of these quiescent cases had resided in the United States at least 7 months prior to the first negative serology, and for some period thereafter before development of parasitemia and antibody response. Serologic results indicated that some persons had had contact with P. falciparum. When parasitemia is rapid in onset and serum is taken immediately, serologic response may be lacking. For detection of presumptive malaria infections, serology may have certain advantages not available with slide examinations. Blood slide examination and malaria serology are used to best advantage together, but either may be valuable in itself, alone, in efforts toward case detection and transmission control in hypoendemic malaria."

Improved understanding of Pf blood-stage growth and development would provide new opportunities to evaluate and interfere with successful completion of the parasite's life cycle. Cultured blood stage Pf was incubated with Hoechst 33342 (HO) and thiazole orange (TO) to stain DNA and total nucleic acids, respectively. Correlated HO and TO fluorescence emissions were then measured by flow cytometry. Complex bivariate data patterns were analyzed by manual cluster gating to quantify parasite life cycle stages. The permutations of viable staining with both reagents were tested for optimal detection of parasitized RBC (pRBC). Pf cultures were exposed to HO and TO simultaneously to achieve optimal staining of pRBC and consistent quantification of early and late stages of the replicative cycle (rings through schizonts). Staining of Pf nucleic acids allows for analysis of parasite development in the absence of fixatives, lysis, or radioactivity to enable examination of erythrocytes from parasite invasion through schizont rupture using sensitive and rapid assay procedures. Investigation of the mechanisms by which anti-malarial drugs and antibodies act against different Pf lifecycle stages will be aided by this cytometric strategy."

An HRP2 test, Paracheck-Pf), and a Giemsa-stained blood film were performed with the pLDH tests for outpatients with suspected malaria. In total, 460 subjects were recruited: 248 with positive blood films and 212 with negative blood films. Plasmodium falciparum was present in 95% of infections. Sensitivity above 90% was shown by two pLDH tests, Carestart (95.6%) and Vistapan (91.9%), and specificity above 90% by Parabank (94.3%) and Carestart (91.5%). Sensitivity decreased with low parasitaemia (chi(2) trend, P<0.001); however, all tests achieved sensitivity >90% with parasitaemia > or =100/microl. All tests had good inter-reader reliability (kappa>0.95). Two weeks after diagnosis, 4-10% of pLDH tests were still positive compared with 69.7% of the HRP2 tests. All tests had similar ease of use. In conclusion, two pLDH tests performed well in diagnosing P. falciparum malaria, and all pLDH tests became negative after treatment more quickly than the HRP2. Therefore the rapid test of choice for use with artemisinin-combination therapies in this area would be one of these new pLDH tests."

CD011431,0,16913523,0,[Scientific standards in parasitology in historical perspective].,"An analysis of scientific standards in parasitology was carried out from the perspective of anthropology of knowledge - a new discipline that emerged from non-classical history science in the 1990s. The history of parasitology, its development and limitations, are presented in a broad socio-cultural context, as the answers of scientists to different social needs in historical periods. In parasitological history there are some periods characteristic for all newly emerging disciplines of natural science. The first systematic account of natural phenomena and their interpretations was initiated in the 16th century and continued till the mid 18th century. It was a period when the phenomena could not be explained in a proper way by the existing and accepted theories. The epidemic diseases were one of these phenomena which were interpreted based on ancient ideas, mostly humoral pathology. In the 16th century a new contagium concept of material factors (pathogenes) that could be spread by contact among humans or close association was formed. This hypothesis, however, was not widely accepted because it contradicted the well-established normative concepts in the European academic naturalism. The development of parasitology was stopped because of theoretical barriers and interpretation difficulties (non-materialistic standard of naturalism, humoral pathology and spontaneous theory). In the second half of the 18th century, the theoretical crisis in natural sciences gave a new impulse for many disciplines; among others, parasitology entered in its second stage of development. The collected observations were classified in a new way and in the context of new interpretations. The progress in parasitology was prompted by the intensified urbanization, rapid increase of European population as well as by wars connected with infections and epidemics. It resulted in two competitive research programs (the French and the German). On the basis of the same observations, they advanced different theoretical interpretations. The third period in the history of parasitology lasted from the mid 19th century to the end of World War I. At that time a common agreement was established in all Europe, with regard to interpretation of standards inspired by positivism, i.e. verification of empirical statements through observation. Parasitology emerged as a separate discipline. Theoretical barriers limiting its progress and setting the questions were overcome. The contagion concept was reinstated. The colonial conquests solving demography problem provided the most important social impulse for the progress in parasitology. It was supported by governments interested in having their colonies free from diseases, mainly malaria and other tropical diseases, and thus safe for the European pioneer settlers. There was also development of parasitological scientific institutions (institutes of tropical medicine) and didactics. After World War I parasitology entered the fruitful stage of discipline development which resulted in a division into subdisciplines and a progress of new scientific fields. Its theoretical standards have become fixed and provided a basis for preventive programmes against parasite diseases, supported financially by European goverments, USA and some other countries. Those programmes were executed both in the home countries and in the colonies. After World War II, in the fourth stage of parasitology development, attention was mainly paid to local natural environment in order to diagnose parasites and their vectors. At the same time, parasitology became an applied science practiced in many specialized centres not only at universities. Presently, the main aims of parasitology are studies on biodiversity of parasites and environmental protection in the developed countries, and within tropical medicine as the travel medicine, because of rapid increase of tourism."

The objective of this study was to assess the morbidity of clinical malaria among children in Nouakchott. Three hundred and one febrile children, consulting at three health facilities of Nouakchott, were screened for malaria in 2009 (n=216) and 2010 (n=85). Plasmodium species identification and parasite density were determined by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin and thick films and confirmed by rapid diagnostic test and nested PCR. Of 301 febrile children, 105 (34.9%) were malaria-positive by nested PCR and 87 (28.9%) by microscopy. Plasmodium vivax represented 97.1% (102/105) and P. falciparum accounted for 2.9% (3/105) of positive cases. All positive children under five years old were infected with P. vivax. The highest numbers of malaria positives were found during or shortly after the rainy season and the lowest during the dry season. Fifty-four of 105 (51.4%) malaria cases, all with P. vivax, had never travelled outside Nouakchott. Individuals belonging to the Moors ethnic group represented 97.0% of P. vivax cases. Results of the present study indicate that malaria is endemic in Nouakchott and that P. vivax is the principal causative agent. Regular surveillance is required to monitor malaria prevalence and incidence, and further measures are needed to counter the possible spread of malaria in the country."

The results demonstrated 118 out of 140 cases (84.3%) positive for malaria parasites, including 60.7%, 20.7% and 2.9% as having Plasmodium vivax (P.v), Plasmodium falciparum (P.f) and mixed infections (P.v+P.f), respectively by microscopy. The nested PCR detected malaria parasites in 134 samples (94.3%), consisting of 51.4% P.v, 12.6% P.f and 29.3% mixed infections. The PCR analysis detected 37 cases of mixed infections more than that of the routine microscopy. These results suggested that there are a considerable number of cases with mixed infections in the study area that mainly remain undiagnosed by microscopy. It is also concluded that the nested PCR is a suitable complement to microscopy for accurate specific diagnosis of malaria species in field."

CD011431,0,22216359,0,The use of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax malaria.,"The long-standing dearth of knowledge surrounding Plasmodium vivax, the most widely distributed of the malaria species, merits urgent attention. A growing awareness of the true burden of this parasite and its potential to cause severe disease, and the identification of increasing parasite resistance in many areas of the world to chloroquine, the mainstay of vivax treatment, underscores the need to identify new and effective treatment strategies. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been widely adopted as first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria and would offer logistic benefits in areas of co-endemicity. However, while ACTs show high and similar efficacy against the blood stages of P. vivax, neither ACTs nor chloroquine are active against vivax hypnozoites and must be complemented with a full course of primaquine to eradicate dormant vivax hypnozoites and prevent relapses. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the most commonly deployed ACT, has shown rapid clearance of P. vivax parasitemia and fever. The relatively short half-life of lumefantrine would appear beneficial in terms of reducing risk of resistance when compared to other ACTs. However, it has a shorter capability to suppress vivax relapses or prevent de novo infections, which generally translates into comparatively lower in vivo short-term measures of efficacy (e.g., day 28 or day 42 uncorrected cure rates). Assuming that the different artemisinin derivatives have equivalent efficacy against vivax, differences between AL and other ACTs may be restricted to the duration of plasma therapeutic levels of the partner drug, a variable of limited clinical relevance, particularly in regions with low vivax transmission rates or in cases where primaquine is added to the regimen to prevent relapses. More rigorous assessment of the use of ACTs in general, and AL in particular, for the treatment of P. vivax infections, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is merited. In the meantime, AL treatment of vivax malaria may be a pragmatic choice for areas with chloroquine-resistant P. vivax, and in co-endemic areas where AL is already used routinely against P. falciparum and parasitological differentiation is not routinely performed or only clinical diagnosis is used."

All consecutive subjects aged >5 years who presented with a history of fever were recruited. Each was checked for P. vivax infection by the standard microscopical examination of bloodsmears and by the immunochromatographic test (ICT). The costs of diagnosis using each method and the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the ICT (with bloodsmear examination used as the 'gold standard') were estimated, the costs/case detected being simulated for different slide positivity 'rates' and ICT sensitivities. In the detection of P. vivax, the ICT had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 99%. The costs of the ICT per subject investigated and per case detected were, respectively, approximately 14 and 20 times more than those of bloodsmear examination. The costs of the ICT per case detected would fall as the sensitivity of the test increased. The ICT gave relatively few false-positive results. The current, relatively high cost of the ICT is the most important barrier to its routine operational use in the diagnosis of malaria. The test is already useful, however, in specific situations."

The Waters Acquity TQD UPLC/MS system equipped with a photodiode array (PDA) detector was used for amino acid separation and detection. The method was developed and validated using amino acid standard mixtures containing acidic, neutral, and basic amino acids. For MS analysis, the optimum cone voltage implemented, based on direct infusion analysis of a few selected AccQ*Tag amino acids with multiple reaction monitoring, varied from 29 to 39 V, whereas the collision energy varied from 15 to 35 V. Calibration curves were built using both internal and external standardization. Typically, a linear response for all amino acids was observed at concentration ranges of 3 x 10(-3)-25 pmol/muL. For some amino acids, concentration limits of detection were as low as 1.65 fmol. The coefficients of variation for retention times were within the range of 0.08-1.08%. The coefficients of variation for amino acid quantitation, determined from triplicate UPLC-MS/MS runs, were below 8% on the average.

Human malaria (Plasmodium falciparum)-infected red cells from continuous human erythrocyte culture were incubated at room temperature in acridine orange stain for 5 min after which the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Since mature red cells contain no DNA, infected red cells were identified with a distinct fluorescent signal. A total of 200,000 cells per sample were counted and analyzed in less than 2 min. Rings, trophozoites, and schizonts were assessed and identified in synchronized infected red cell cultures by flow cytometry. In addition, various stages of infected red cells were isolated with a cell sorter. This rapid method permits accurate and reliable assessment of data with the exclusion of anomalous data such as damaged cells, extraneous material, and contaminating particles."
CD011431,0,16878344,0,Rapid gas chromatography/mass spectrometry quinine determination in plasma after automated solid-phase extraction.,"The combined use of an automatic solid-phase extraction (SPE) apparatus with Oasis MCX cartridges and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to rapidly quantify quinine in biological samples with cyproheptadine as the internal standard is described. The selected ion monitoring mode, with the quantification ions m/z 136 and 287 (qualifier ions: m/z 261, 381 and 215, 96), allows the estimation of quinine levels, respectively. Separation was completed within 12.7 min. Excellent linearity was found up to 10 000 microg/L of plasma. The limit of detection (LOD) was 12.2 microg/L and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 40.6 microg/L. High reproducibility (intra-assay CV range 1.9-4.3%, inter-assay CV range 2.2-11.3%) and accuracy values (intra-assay range 83.2-103.7%, inter-assay range 86.8-103.7%) were obtained. Recoveries were concentration-independent (97.2% and 89.8% for 4000 and 10 000 microg/L, respectively). This sensitive, simple assay for quinine in various matrices meets the current requirements for bioanalytical assays and may be used to monitor quinine levels in patients developing severe malaria with acute renal failure during hemofiltration. The optimal quinine dose in this situation is not really established and to improve clinical care, quinine concentrations might be explored to improve efficacy and minimise potential toxicity."
CD011431,0,3319260,0,[Current aspects of imported drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum].,"24 cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a group of 73 non-immune subjects coming mostly from central Africa have been tested in vitro for chloroquine sensitivity: 5 are sensitive, 19 are resistant among whom one is also quinine-resistant. The comparison of the major clinical and biological features in the two groups by methods of statistical calculation shows that the parasitological diagnosis is retarded and that hemolysis is more frequent in the strains of Plasmodium falciparum resistant to chloroquine. Thrombopenia is more frequent with chemosensitives strains. In any case, the delay between the first symptoms and the parasitological diagnosis is increased with an average of 17 days in comparison to what was observed in the 1970's. Under the influence of several complex factors including human ones, the clinical aspects are changed in comparison to forms usually observed. In this context of an extension of the emergence of the chemoresistance and in the aim of efficiency, only the quinine I.V., with an average dose of 16.5 mg/kg per day of quinine-base, has been chosen as a curative treatment during 5 days allowing a rapid recovery without after-effects for all the cases."
CD011431,0,20529273,1,Field evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test (Parascreen) for malaria diagnosis in the Peruvian Amazon.,"The rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (RDT) constitute a fast and opportune alternative for non-complicated malaria diagnosis in areas where microscopy is not available. The objective of this study was to validate a RDT named Parascreen under field conditions in Iquitos, department of Loreto, Peru. Parascreen is a RDT that detects the histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) antigen from Plasmodium falciparum and lactate deshydrogenase from all Plasmodium species."

CD011431,0,18226243,0,Pilot assessment of the sensitivity of the malaria thin film.,"Malaria microscopy remains the reference standard for malaria diagnosis in clinical trials (drug and vaccine), new diagnostic evaluation, as well as in clinical care in much of the world today. It is known that microscopy is an imperfect gold standard, and that very low false positive rates can dramatically lower protective efficacy estimates in malaria prevention trials. Although new methods are now available, including malaria rapid diagnostic tests and PCR, neither is as yet validated in the clinical trial setting and both have limitations. Surprisingly, the sensitivity of thin smears is not well established and thin smears are not commonly used in the developing world."
CD011431,0,18165483,1,A review of malaria diagnostic tools: microscopy and rapid diagnostic test (RDT).,"The absolute necessity for rational therapy in the face of rampant drug resistance places increasing importance on the accuracy of malaria diagnosis. Giemsa microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) represent the two diagnostics most likely to have the largest impact on malaria control today. These two methods, each with characteristic strengths and limitations, together represent the best hope for accurate diagnosis as a key component of successful malaria control. This review addresses the quality issues with current malaria diagnostics and presents data from recent rapid diagnostic test trials. Reduction of malaria morbidity and drug resistance intensity plus the associated economic loss of these two factors require urgent scaling up of the quality of parasite-based diagnostic methods. An investment in anti-malarial drug development or malaria vaccine development should be accompanied by a parallel commitment to improve diagnostic tools and their availability to people living in malarious areas."
CD011431,0,11513554,0,Detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Wuchereria bancrofti infected blood samples using multiplex PCR.,"A rapid and sensitive multiplex PCR has been developed for the diagnosis of multiple parasitic infection in human blood. Infection is detected by a single multiplex PCR reaction containing two pairs of oligonucleotide primers whereby each primer is specific for each parasite species. These primer sets amplified 400 and 450-bp fragments for Wuchereria bancrofti and 208-bp fragment for Plasmodium falciparum. The PCR products derived from each parasite species were visualized in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, therefore allowing the rapid identification of any, or all, of the two human parasites, if present, in a single amplification reaction. This multiplex PCR was very sensitive with the ability to detect the presence of as little as 10 pg of parasite DNA. The primers used in this multiplex PCR also showed highly specific amplification of each respective parasite DNA without the presence of non-specific and non-target PCR products. This multiplex PCR system was used to analyse 36 human blood samples of Myanmar workers in the endemic area at Tak Province, Thailand. Two samples showed the multiple infection, 27 samples were either infected with W. bancrofti or P. falciparum and seven samples were negative for both methods. The high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity of this multiplex PCR method make it suitable for large-scale epidemiological studies and following of drug treatment."
CD011431,0,15000726,1,Comparison of the OptiMAL rapid antigen test with field microscopy for the detection of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum: considerations for the application of the rapid test in Afghanistan.,"To establish the sensitivity and specificity of a batch of 'OptiMAL 48' rapid antigen tests procured by the World Health Organization in Afghanistan, a sample was tested, in parallel with routine, microscopical diagnosis, at basic health units (BHU) within Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan. The results of both methods of field diagnosis were compared with those of cross-checking microscopy at a reference laboratory, which were taken as the 'gold standard'. Out of 499 patients examined, 36% were diagnosed as malaria cases by field microscopy and 34% by the rapid test. For the OptiMAL 48 test, cross-checking of the corresponding smears at the reference laboratory gave a sensitivity of 79.3% and a specificity of 99.7% for Plasmodium falciparum and corresponding values of 86.1% and 98.7% for P. vivax infections. The performance of the field microscopy was better, with a sensitivity and specificity of 85.2% and 99.7% for P. falciparum, and 90.4% and 98.7% for P. vivax, respectively. These results show that the performance of OptiMAL 48 is adequate for acute- and post-emergency situations when the alternative is just clinical diagnosis. However, in the developing health system of Afghanistan, the main focus should be on the expansion of the existing network for microscopical diagnosis and quality control, to meet the needs of a stable situation. Rapid antigen tests are more suited to investigations of outbreaks in remote situations, where health services are deficient or absent."

CD011431,0,9463665,0,TrypTect CIATT--a card indirect agglutination trypanosomiasis test for diagnosis of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infections.,"A simple and rapid test, the card indirect agglutination trypanosomiasis test (TrypTect CIATT) is described, for detecting circulating antigens in persons suffering from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infection by latex agglutination. The sensitivity of the test (95.8% for T. b. gambiense and 97.7% for T. b. rhodesiense) was significantly higher than that of lymph node puncture, microhaematocrit centrifugation and cerebrospinal fluid examination after single and double centrifugation. The specificity of the test was also high: 106 blood donor sera as well as sera from 37 patients with malaria, 25 with visceral leishmaniasis, 10 with schistosomiasis, 5 with filariasis and 10 with hydatid disease, from trypanosomiasis-free areas, gave negative results. Eighteen clinical suspects from active disease transmission foci, without microscopically detectable parasitaemia but with a positive test result, were further examined by lumbar puncture and inoculation of blood into mice; 11 (61%) were found to be infected, suggesting that the test had a high positive predictive value. This study showed that TrypTect CIATT is a useful test for rapid diagnosis of both patent and non-patent T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense infections."
CD011431,0,22302848,1,"Performance of two malaria rapid diagnostic tests in febrile adult patients with and without human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection in Blantyre, Malawi.","The performance of two histidine-rich protein type-2-based malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) was examined in a rural area with a high prevalence of malaria and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection in 113 and 445 febrile patients ≥ 15 years of age with and without HIV-1 infection, respectively. Patients were tested for HIV-1 infection by using a standard assay and for Plasmodium falciparum by using two mRDTs and microscopy. When microscopy was used as the gold standard, both mRDTs performed similarly in patients with and without HIV-1 infection: Bioline SD Malaria Antigen P.f, sensitivity 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 81.3-99.3%) versus 97.1% (95% CI:92.8-99.2%) and specificity 50.6% (95% CI: 39.0-62.2%) versus 47.2% (95% CI: 41.4-53.1%); and ICT diagnostics Malaria Pf, sensitivity 94.4% (95% CI: 81.3-99.3%) versus 97.1% (95% CI: 92.8-99.2%) and specificity 50.6% (95% CI:39.0-62.2%) versus 50.3% (95% CI: 44.4-56.1%). Infection with HIV-1 does not appear to affect the performance of these histidine-rich protein type-2 (HRP-2)-based mRDTs."
CD011431,0,23022040,0,Severe febrile illness in adult hospital admissions in Tanzania: a prospective study in an area of high malaria transmission.,"Severe febrile illness is a major cause of adult hospital admission in Africa. Studies of non-malarial fever come largely from children or from high HIV prevalence settings. This prospective study of adult admissions with severe febrile illness in a malaria-endemic area with moderate/low HIV prevalence investigated admission diagnosis as well as final diagnosis based on results of investigations. Severe malaria was the admission diagnosis in 148/198 (74.7%) cases. Plasmodium falciparum was identified in 38/188 (20.2%) admissions and 26/198 (13.1%) were bacteraemic, with 13/25 (52%) prescribed empirical antibiotics. HIV was equally common among those with (16/37; 43.2%) and without P. falciparum (50/138; 36.2%) (p=0.44). In 6/22 (27.3%) deaths, blood cultures were positive for a pathogen, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and non-Typhi Salmonella predominating. Chest radiography was suspicious for bacterial/mycobacterial disease in 5/22 additional deaths. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were more sensitive but less specific than WHO severe malaria criteria for predicting mortality. Malaria is overdiagnosed in adults with severe febrile illness and was not associated with mortality in the absence of co-infection in this high-incidence setting. Adults with severe febrile illness should be tested for malaria and HIV using rapid, sensitive tests. Early antibiotic use should be promoted. Improved diagnostics for invasive bacterial disease are needed."

CD011431,0,9425385,0,Efficacy of tepid sponging versus paracetamol in reducing temperature in febrile children.,"A block randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of tepid sponging with the use of paracetamol in febrile children was undertaken at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre. Eighty children aged between 6 and 54 months with axillary temperatures of between > or = 38.5 degrees C and < or = 40 degrees C and a clinical diagnosis consistent with upper respiratory tract infection and/or malaria were block randomized to receive either oral paracetamol (15 mg/kg) or tepid sponging. Children receiving tepid sponging were sponged from head to toe (except the scalp) by leaving a thin layer of water on the body. If the body became dry it was repeated and continued until the axillary temperature fell to < 38.5 degrees C. Axillary temperature and assessment of discomfort (convulsions, crying, irritability, vomiting and shivering) were recorded every 30 minutes for 2 hours. A significantly greater and more rapid reduction of fever was demonstrated with paracetamol than with tepid sponging. Tepid sponging without antipyretics is often used to reduce fever, but our results suggest that this is effective only during the 1st 30 minutes. Paracetamol is clearly more effective than tepid sponging in reducing body temperature in febrile children in a tropical climate."

CD011431,0,17050066,0,Development of an automated malaria discriminant factor using VCS technology.,"Malaria diagnosis presents a challenge to all laboratories. There is a need for rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective screening on all samples, particularly in areas where malaria is endemic. Response to malaria infection involves an increased monocyte count and production of large activated monocytes. These changes can be detected by volume, conductivity, and scatter (VCS) technology on certain automated blood cell counters (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). The SD of the volume of lymphocytes and monocytes demonstrates a significant difference from normal when malaria is present. By using a calculation derived from the SD volume of the lymphocytes and monocytes, herein termed the malaria factor, sensitivity of 98% and specificity 94% were demonstrated for the detection of malaria. Based on this derived discriminant, VCS technology should become a useful tool in the detection of malaria. A flag to indicate the potential presence of malaria could then be generated by the instrument if the user or manufacturer chose to do so."
CD011431,0,22302847,1,False-negative rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and deletion of the histidine-rich repeat region of the hrp2 gene.,"We identified 480 persons with positive thick smears for asexual Plasmodium falciparum parasites, of whom 454 had positive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) product of the hrp2 gene and 26 had negative tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for the histidine-rich repeat region of that gene was negative in one-half (10/22) of false-negative specimens available, consistent with spontaneous deletion. False-negative RDTs were found only in persons with asymptomatic infections, and multiplicities of infection (MOIs) were lower in persons with false-negative RDTs (both P < 0.001). These results show that parasites that fail to produce HRP2 can cause patent bloodstream infections and false-negative RDT results. The importance of these observations is likely to increase as malaria control improves, because lower MOIs are associated with false-negative RDTs and false-negative RDTs are more frequent in persons with asymptomatic infections. These findings suggest that the use of HRP2-based RDTs should be reconsidered."

CD011431,0,14550478,0,A multiplex polymerase chain reaction for a differential diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.,"A multiplex PCR was designed for the differential diagnosis of the two parasite species by targeting the 18S rRNA gene with a set of primer combinations, amplifying DNA fragments of 1451-bp and 833-bp for P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. The sensitivity of this PCR test was high, as minimal as 0.1 parasite per one microliter of blood sample and a minimum of four copies of the target gene could be detected. For the diagnosis of mixed infection of two Plasmodium spp., there were no apparent competition or cross-reaction between the majority and minority Plasmodium species. The multiplex PCR was evaluated on 210 clinical samples and 60 normal controls. The PCR test yielded highly concordant results with microscopic examination, with the only one exception of a mixed (P. falciparum plus P. vivax) infection case, which was diagnosed as a single infection of P. falciparum by microscopy. We propose that the multiplex PCR is a sensitive, specific, and rapid tool that can serve as a useful differential diagnostic tool for detecting P. falciparum and P. vivax."
CD011431,0,9764322,1,Comparison of the ParaSight-F test and the ICT Malaria Pf test with the polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in travellers.,"Rapid and accurate methods are needed for the diagnosis of imported malaria. The ParaSight-F test and the ICT Malaria Pf test are commercially available kits marketed for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Both tests are antigen-capture assays based on the detection of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 in peripheral blood. Using microscopy and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method as reference standards, we performed a 'blinded' comparison of these assays for the detection of P. falciparum infection in 200 febrile travellers returning from malaria-endemic areas. As determined by PCR and microscopy, 148 travellers had malaria and, of these patients, 54.7% (81/148) were infected with P. vivax only, 31.1% (46/148) with P. falciparum only, 9.5% (14/148) with P. ovale, 0.7% (1/148) with P. malariae, and 4.1% (6/148) had mixed infections. Compared to PCR, the ParaSight-F and ICT Malaria Pf tests had initial sensitivities of 94% and 90% and specificities of 95% and 97%, respectively, for the detection of P. falciparum malaria. When discrepant samples were retested with day 0 and day 1 bloods, the sensitivities improved to 96% and 94%, respectively. The 2 remaining false negative results with the Para-Sight-F test and 2 of the 3 false negative results with the ICT Malaria Pf test occurred in samples with < 100 parasites/microL. The performance of these kits was not significantly different (P = 0.75) and both are simple, rapid, and accurate tests for the detection of P. falciparum infection in the returned traveller."

CD011431,0,23239093,0,Postrenal transplant Plasmodium vivax malaria: neglected and not benign.,"Plasmodium vivax is causing increasingly more cases of severe malaria worldwide. We reported a case of postrenal transplantation acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with P. vivax, a neglected human malaria parasite. The diagnosis of P. vivax monoinfection was confirmed by direct visualization of the parasite in blood smear and rapid diagnostic test. On admission, serum creatinine (SCr.) increased from 1.45 to 3.7 mg/dl. The other etiologies of fever and AKI were ruled out. He responded to prompt therapy with antimalarial drugs. There was no change in tacrolimus trough level before and after antimalarial drugs. Two weeks after discharge, his SCr. was 1.43 mg/dl. Our patient lived in an endemic malarial area and the transplant took place in December 2010. The patient subsequently presented with clinical malaria in June 2012, so we thought that posttransplantation transmission by the mosquito was a possibility and very less likely that other dormant form of the parasite had been the source of the clinical infection. P. vivax can lead to as AKI in renal transplant recipient. P. vivax should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever in transplant recipients who had received organs or blood products from malaria-endemic area to facilitate a prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment."

Since the first description of the diagnosis of Plasmodium infection by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR), the role of this kind of molecular method in the laboratory diagnosis of imported malaria is still a topical question. PCR-based assays were found to be more sensitive and more specific than all conventional methods. The highest contribution of the molecular diagnosis is that a PCR negative result would ascertain the lack of any malaria infection, thus quickly orienting the investigations toward other aetiology. This technique should be now considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of imported malaria."

The three assays failed to detect two positive samples with P. ovale and P. malariae. Assays were also compared with regard to the expense of equipment and reagents and speed and ease of use. The rapid ICT and ParaSight F test can be performed with minimal training and may be specially useful in areas where P. falciparum is the predominant malaria species, in epidemic malaria regions, and where skilled microscopy is not readily available."
CD011431,0,11548313,0,[Current malaria situation in the Republic of Uzbekistan].,"Malaria was once one of the most common diseases in Uzbekistan. There were massive epidemics with high mortality rates, wherein 140,000 to 700,000 cases of malaria were recorded. Following large-scale malaria control measures, the disease was eradicated in Uzbekistan in 1961 and the epidemiological situation is still favorable. The natural and climatic conditions that prevail in the Republic of Uzbekistan mean that the country is very susceptible to malaria. There are large water areas varying in type and origin, which provide a habitat for a number of epidemiologically dangerous species of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in a single area. These are Anopheles maculipennis, An. pulcherrimus and An. superpictus. The prevailing temperatures promote rapid growth of vector mosquitoes and parasites and the malaria transmission season is over 5 months long. Seven malaria-transmitting mosquito species have been recently recorded in the Republic. DDT resistance has been so far noted in Anopheles maculipennis, An. hyrcanus and An. bifurcatus. An. superpictus is sensitive to all insecticides used in clinical practice (organophosphorus and organochlorine compounds, HOS, carbamates, pyrethroids). The most dangerous areas for transmitting malaria by importation are the flood plains of the country's main rivers, such as Syrdarya, Amudarya, Chirchik, Surkhana, etc., and rice-growing areas (an area of about 150,000 ha was under rice cultivation in 1999). The Republic is still very subjected to large-scale importations of malaria particularly in the towns and areas along the border with Tajikistan. There has been recently an increase in the incidence of infections imported into the Republic: 27 cases in 1995, 51 in 1996, 52 in 1997, 74 in 1998, and 78 in 1999. Eight regions of Uzbekistan border Tajikistan, their population is over 5.6 million people. In addition, close family ties between the populations of the frontier towns and regions further increase the risk for malaria to be imported and passed on. Noteworthy is the Surkhandaryin region that accounted for 60% of the cases recorded in 1999. The number of towns and villages where malaria occurs for the first time increased (49 and 46 cases in 1999 and 1998, respectively). The number of cases imported into rural areas also increased (70 (83%) cases in 1999 versus 48 (65%) cases in 1998); due to the large populations of malaria mosquitoes, there is a real danger that the disease may spread. In 1999, most cases of malaria were imported from Tajikistan (65 cases or 76% of all cases). There was a case from each of the following countries: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan and 5 cases from Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan. The recorded cases included slighly more men than women (54% vs 46%). There were 10 infected children under 14 years, which was 23.5% of all notified cases. Analyzing various populations showed that 67.1% of the patients visited their relatives in malaria-endemic countries (mostly Tajikistan) and 25.8% migrated from Tajikistan. All the detected cases were confirmed by laboratory tests. As in the past, most cases were tertian (P. vivax) malaria (n = 82 or 96.4% of all cases). Tropical (P. falciparum) malaria was confirmed in 3 (3.5%) cases. These cases had been imported from Tajikistan into the Surkhandaryin region. Seventy seven (91%) cases were detected in the epidemical season. Of them 58 (68.2%) cases were detected during a malaria transmission season. Seven cases who contacted the patients with imported malaria and were infected were recorded in 1999. They included 4 and 3 cases in the Surkhandaryin and Kashkadaryin Regions, respectively. In 1999, there was a decline in the number of malaria patients who needed health care and in the diagnosed malaria cases in therapeutical and prophylactic institutions. Throughout the country, 34 (40%) of the 85 detected cases presented within 3 days of malaria outbreak (68.9% in 1998). Malaria was immediate diagnosed in 43.5% of cases (64.9% in 1998). The remaining cases were diagnosed as having acute respiratory viral infections, tropical and parasitic diseases, viral hepatitis, or influenza. Early diagnosis of malaria was made in 60% of cases (77% in 1998). Three cases of imported tertian malaria were recorded in the Tashkent Region in the first quarter of 2000. They were imported from Tajikistan into rural areas and the patients had been infected during the 1999 season. Epidemiological surveillance of malaria in Uzbekistan is regularly carried out by the general network of health facilities and by the departments of parasitology of state epidemiological surveillance centers in collaboration with medical administrative departments, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the L.M. Isayev Research Institute of Medical Parasitology, and other agencies. Active links are maintained with WHO under the Roll Back Malaria programme. Great emphasis is laid on medical staff training at all levels. During the 1999 epidemiological survey, 672,536 laboratory tests were performed on blood samples from suspected malaria patients and individuals who had visited malaria-endemic countries, 55% of them suffering from fever. A total area of 17 million m2 of dwelling and nondwelling buildings 20 ha of water areas were treated against mosquitoes and the larvivorous fish Gambusia was put into the water areas occupying 6,500 ha. In all cases of malaria, the focus of infection was epidemiologically surveyed and required epidemic preventive measures were implemented. All malaria patients received a full course of radical therapy and recovered completely. The epidemiological surveillance system for malaria is affected by staff shortages at the parasitology departments of state epidemiological surveillance centers and by shortages of microscopes, reagents, sterilizing equipment, insecticides, etc. There are still difficulties in obtaining supplies of primaquine although a small stock is locally available as due to WHO humanitarian assistance. The Epidemiological Malaria Surveillance Programme for the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2000-2004, intended to strengthen the epidemic control capacity of health care facilities, Ministry of Health, is under adoption. The following activities are scheduled for 2000: to plan malaria control activities, including the zoning of the country by the risk of malaria transmission in accordance with republic-leveled directives, instructions, and methodology and WHO recommendations: adjustments to these plans to be made as necessary; to fill vacant posts in the parasitology departments of state epidemiological surveillance centers; to procure stocks of antimalarial drugs, reagents, insecticides, sterilizing equipment, etc., to be paid for from epidemiological service resources; to include malaria issues into certifying tests for physicians, as appropriate for the posts to be occupied and their level of qualifications; to publish posters, brochures, and leaflets about malaria prevention before the malaria transmission season for health education; to hold seminars and meetings for health workers on the etiology of malaria, its clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."
CD011431,0,8784548,0,[Control of malaria re-emergence in Reunion].,"Réunion is currently posed with the operational problem of the last phase of the struggle against malaria, that is the consolidation and the maintenance of the state of cradication. The native parasite was eliminated, but the risk of resurgence of malaria remains on the island. This risk is even increasing from year to year because of the following: 1) the regular increase of the number of travellers originating from countries with malaria and consequently, the increase in the number of imported malaria cases; 2) the appearance of malaria strains resistant to amino-4-quinoleines, in the south-western regions of the Indian Ocean; 3) the persistence of the vector which cannot be eliminated because of its rapid evolutionary cycle and the multiplicity of its larval habitats. Furthermore, the reintroduction of malaria on the island would present serious consequences considering the disappearance of immunity in the population of Réunion. Thus it is necessary to maintain the struggle at a high level of intervention following a strategy based on: 1) the detection and the control of the malaria cases; 2) a targeted anti-vectorial activity based on a systematic anti-larval fight, eventually completed by the eradication of the adapted adult vectors. The reduction of personnel and the difficulties encountered in establishing a mechanization of the adapted tasks lead to a reduction of activities of insect eradication and endanger the existing strategy of the struggle. This strategy has been redefined during these last several years. The malaria situation in Réunion, satisfactory until today, rests on a careful epidemiological surveillance and on an optimized entomological surveillance. Currently, the treatments are abandoned in the least sensitive zones to the benefit of a better surveillance of priority zones (prospecting, entomological studies and treatments). Anopheles gambiae s.l. is present on the island and each year some parasites are imported to the Réunion territory. The requisite conditions for an eventual re-emergence of transmission of the native parasite would seem to be combined. However, this transmission is not observed. The role of the Applied Entomology Group is to evaluate the risk of malaria and to reorient, if necessary, the strategy of the antimalaria struggle in Réunion."

CD011431,0,18680960,1,"Paracheck Pf compared with microscopy for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among children in Tanga City, north-eastern Tanzania.","Malaria is a major public health problem particularly in rural Sub-Saharan Africa. In most urban areas, malaria transmission intensity is low thus monitoring trends using reliable tools is crucial to provide vital information for future management of the disease. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) such as Paracheck Pf are now increasingly adopted for Plasmodium falciparum malaria diagnosis and are advantageous and cost effective alternative to microscopy. This cross sectional survey was carried out during June 2005 to determine the prevalence of malaria in an urban setting and compare microscopy diagnosis versus Paracheck Pf for detecting Plasmodium falciparum. Blood samples from a total of 301 children (< 10 years) attending outpatient clinic at Makorora Health Centre, in Tanga, Tanzania were examined for the presence of malaria. Twenty-nine (9.6%) of the children were positive to malaria by microscopy while 30 (10.0%) were positive by Paracheck test. Three out of 30 positive cases detected by Paracheck were negative by microscopy; thus considered to be false positive results. For the 271 Paracheck Pf negative cases, 2 were positive by microscopy; yielding 2 false negative results. Paracheck Pf sensitivity and specificity were 93.1% and 98.9%, respectively. P. falciparum was the only malarial species observed among the 29 microscopy positive cases. The prevalence of anaemia among the children was 53.16%. These findings indicate a low prevalence of malaria in Tanga City and that Paracheck Pf can be an effective tool for malaria diagnosis."
CD011431,0,11425156,1,Diagnosis of imported malaria by Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2)-based immunocapture assays.,"This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of two rapid non-microscopic assays: Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) assay (OptiMAL) and Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2) assay (ICT Malaria). The assays were used to detect malaria infection in 515 immigrants living in Kuwait. The performance of both assays was compared to that of microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick blood films and to each other. Of the 515 patients tested, 163 were positive for malaria parasites by microscopy of thick blood film. Of these, 87 were infected with Plasmodium vivax parasites, 63 with P. falciparum, 1 with Plasmodium malariae, and 12 had mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax. The PfHRP-2 assay detected 53 P. falciparum infections and, as expected, failed to detect all but one case of P. vivax. Three cases of mixed infections were also not detected by this assay. The pLDH assay detected 56 P. falciparum cases and 77 P. vivax infections but failed to detect 4 cases of mixed infections. Compared to microscopy, the performance of both the assays to diagnose P. falciparum infection was comparable. The sensitivity for the PfHRP-2 assay was 82% with a specificity of 99.0% and for the pLDH assay the sensitivity was 89% with a specificity of 99.5%. The PfHRP-2 assay detected 4 false positive cases, 2 of which were also detected by the pLDH assay. These patients reported treatment with chloroquine in the last 2-5 weeks. Though the immunocapture diagnostic assays may be helpful in certain situations, microscopy of thick blood film is still the method of choice in diagnosing imported malaria."

CD011431,0,16088837,0,Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and its effect on the performance of PfHRP2-based rapid diagnostic tests.,"Rising costs of antimalarial agents are increasing the demand for accurate diagnosis of malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer great potential to improve the diagnosis of malaria, particularly in remote areas. Many RDTs are based on the detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein (PfHRP) 2, but reports from field tests have questioned their sensitivity and reliability. We hypothesize that the variability in the results of PfHRP2-based RDTs is related to the variability in the target antigen. We tested this hypothesis by examining the genetic diversity of PfHRP2, which includes numerous amino acid repeats, in 75 P. falciparum lines and isolates originating from 19 countries and testing a subset of parasites by use of 2 PfHRP2-based RDTs. We observed extensive diversity in PfHRP2 sequences, both within and between countries. Logistic regression analysis indicated that 2 types of repeats were predictive of RDT detection sensitivity (87.5% accuracy), with predictions suggesting that only 84% of P. falciparum parasites in the Asia-Pacific region are likely to be detected at densities < or = 250 parasites/microL. Our data also indicated that PfHRP3 may play a role in the performance of PfHRP2-based RDTs. These findings provide an alternative explanation for the variable sensitivity in field tests of malaria RDTs that is not due to the quality of the RDTs."

The leading symptoms are diarrhoea (68%), fever (20%) and skin conditions (9%), sometimes in combination. The travel history is of decisive importance for the diagnosis. Quite simple questions aimed at identifying the start of the illness, symptoms, destination, travel class and vaccinations can be useful for differentiation purposes. For the acute diagnosis, such aids as urine stick test, centrifuge, microscope, a range of stains, and a stool test for occult blood suffice. The most common serious travel-specific diseases include malaria, falciparum > tertian, dengue fever, hepatitis, and rickettsiosis.

In accordance with this protocol, the delivery of a diagnostic test (rapid diagnostic test or microscopy) was made compulsory prior to the administration of antimalarial drugs (ACTs: artemisinin-based combination therapies). We collected camp clinic records on outpatient malaria diagnoses from 2004 through 2007 and compared the morbidity percentages attributed to malaria during these years, as well as the actual incidence of malaria in 2006 and 2007. Our analyses demonstrate that malaria accounted for 45.8% of all morbidity in 2004 (64,557 malaria cases out of 1,40,669 total morbidity), followed by corresponding figures of 47.8% for 2005 (94,389 malaria cases out of 1,97,400) and 47.9% for 2006 (60,760 malaria cases out of 1,26,754); however, the values dropped sharply to 22.8% in 2007 (20,136 malaria cases out of 88,254). We found a similar drastic drop in the incidence of malaria from an average of 182.415 cases/1000 inhabitants/month in 2006 to only 35.635 cases/1000 inhabitants/month in 2007. The results of our study suggest that because of the overlap of symptoms from malarial and non-malarial febrile illnesses, diagnosing malaria on clinical and epidemiological bases may lead to its overdiagnosis. This could result in both the overprescription of antimalarials and the underdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment of non-malarial febrile processes. The use of affordable and available tests can increase the accuracy of malaria diagnoses, so that only real malaria cases would be treated as such. This would help curb the uncontrolled administration of antimalarials to prevent the development of resistance to new malarial treatments and thus decrease treatment expenses. This way, financial, material and human resources can be allocated to other health issues that currently go unnoticed."

CD011431,0,14605156,1,Multicenter study to evaluate the OptiMAL test for rapid diagnosis of malaria in U.S. hospitals.,"More than 1,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed each year in the United States. Reported numbers, however, may be artificially low because many clinicians fail to consider the diagnosis on presentation, U.S. hospital laboratory technologists have very limited experience in detecting and identifying malaria parasites, and reporting of malaria to state health departments is sporadic in many states. In this study, a rapid malaria diagnostic test, the OptiMAL test (DiaMed; under license from Flow Inc., Portland, Oreg.) was evaluated in six U.S. hospitals and compared with results of microscopy. The OptiMAL test is a 15-min rapid immunochromatographic test that both identifies and differentiates Plasmodium falciparum from non-P. falciparum malaria parasites on the basis of the detection of parasite lactate dehydrogenase in a drop of patient blood. A total of 216 specimens from patients suspected of having malaria were tested. Results indicated that 43 samples (20%) were positive for malaria parasites by microscopy (32 P. falciparum, 11 non-P. falciparum) while 42 (19%) were positive by OptiMAL (31 P. falciparum, 11 non-P. falciparum). The sensitivity of the OptiMAL test was 98%; its specificity was 100%, with positive and negative predictive values of 100 and 99%, respectively. Participating hospital physicians and laboratory directors independently reported that the OptiMAL rapid malaria test was accurate, easy to use, and well accepted by those working in their diagnostic laboratories. The overall conclusion was that integration of the OptiMAL rapid malaria test into the U.S. health care infrastructure would provide an important and easy-to-use tool for the timely diagnosis of malaria."

Rapid diagnosis of all Plasmodium species is essential for initiation of effective treatment. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are sensitive for detection of uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria but have not been systematically evaluated in knowlesi malaria. At a tertiary referral hospital in Sabah, Malaysia, we prospectively evaluated the sensitivity of two combination RDTs for the diagnosis of uncomplicated and severe malaria from all three potentially fatal Plasmodium species, using a pan-Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)-P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) RDT (First Response) and a pan-Plasmodium aldolase-PfHRP2 RDT (ParaHIT). Among 293 hospitalized adults with PCR-confirmed Plasmodium monoinfection, the sensitivity of the pLDH component of the pLDH-PfHRP2 RDT was 74% (95/129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 65 to 80%), 91% (110/121; 95% CI, 84 to 95%), and 95% (41/43; 95% CI, 85 to 99%) for PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi, P. falciparum, and P. vivax infections, respectively, and 88% (30/34; 95% CI, 73 to 95%), 90% (38/42; 95% CI, 78 to 96%), and 100% (12/12; 95% CI, 76 to 100%) among patients tested before antimalarial treatment was begun. Sensitivity in severe malaria was 95% (36/38; 95% CI, 83 to 99), 100% (13/13; 95% CI, 77 to 100), and 100% (7/7; 95% CI, 65 to 100%), respectively. The aldolase component of the aldolase-PfHRP2 RDT performed poorly in all Plasmodium species. The pLDH-based RDT was highly sensitive for the diagnosis of severe malaria from all species; however, neither the pLDH- nor aldolase-based RDT demonstrated sufficiently high overall sensitivity for P. knowlesi. More sensitive RDTs are needed in regions of P. knowlesi endemicity."

Suspected treatment failures, pregnant women and infants with clinical malaria and general fever cases were tested at health facilities in malaria hypo-, meso- and holoendemic areas. A total of 1326 tests were carried out by health unit staff, cross read by experienced laboratory staff and results compared with thick film microscopy as the standard. Rater agreement in reading the dipstick result between health unit staff and laboratory staff was high, kappa index 0.94 (0.88-0.99). Sensitivity was 99.6% (99.0-100) for parasite densities above 500/microl, 98.6% (97.7-99.6) for densities above 50/microl and 22.2% (8.6-42.3) for densities below 10/microl. With the applied testing strategies no differences were found between endemicity levels or patient categories. Specificity was 86.2% (83.3-88.8) overall, but significantly higher in general fever cases (92.7%) compared to the other patient groups (84.3%, P=0.009). At the given prevalences positive predictive values (ppv) were above 80% and negative predictive values (npv) above 90% in all cases except in pregnant women (ppv: 77.8%).

CD011431,0,21730769,0,Robotic health assistant (Feverkit) for the rational management of fevers among nomads in Nigeria.,"The innovation described in this paper was motivated by concern that in Africa, parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs is associated with irrational drug use where health facilities are inaccessible. However, advancement in digital technology, simple diagnostic devices and smart drug packaging inspire innovative strategies. The combination of communication technology, rapid diagnostic tools, and antibiotic and antimalarial medicines can increase access to evidence-based malaria management, reduce mortality and slow the development of resistance to drugs. The author initiated development of a solar-powered device (Feverkit) programmed with user-interactive capabilities and equipped with a detachable laboratory and dispensary for community management of fevers. The operational performance of 10 units of the device was evaluated among 20 nomadic Fulani communities in northeastern Nigeria. A brief introduction to its parts and functions was sufficient for community-selected nomadic caregivers to use it competently for managing 207 fever cases in eight weeks, with a 97% (p=.000) recovery rate. The Feverkit guided the nomads to distinguish between malaria and non-malaria-induced fevers, and thus selectively treat them. Camp communities accepted the device and were willing to pay between US$33 and $334 (mean, $113; mode, $67) to keep it. Public-private sector collaboration is essential for sustaining and scaling up production of the Feverkit as a commercial health device for the management of fevers among nomads."

CD011431,0,20075115,0,Cloning and expression of the immunoreactive Brucella melitensis 28 kDa outer-membrane protein (Omp28) encoding gene and evaluation of the potential of Omp28 for clinical diagnosis of brucellosis.,"Brucellosis is a disease caused by Gram-negative, facultative, intracellular bacteria belonging to the genus Brucella. It is an emerging zoonosis, and an economically important infection of humans and livestock with a worldwide distribution. Human infection is known to occur through consumption of infected raw milk, milk products and undercooked or raw meat. Serodiagnosis of brucellosis is carried out by detection of antibodies generated against LPS or whole-cell bacterial extracts by ELISA or agglutination tests using colorimetry. The present study was designed to develop a highly sensitive and specific indirect ELISA in both a microtitre plate and dot-blot format employing the recombinant outer-membrane protein 28 (rOmp28). Cloning and expression of Brucella melitensis Omp28 protein, which is a group 3 antigen, was accomplished by PCR amplification and cloning of the gene in a pET-28a expression system, followed by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography purification of the His-tagged recombinant protein. An indirect ELISA in both a microtitre plate and dot-blot format was optimized with sera collected from three groups: culture-confirmed cases, clinically suspected cases and healthy individuals. The rOmp28 protein reacted only with the culture-confirmed positive samples and no reaction was observed with culture-negative samples, confirming the immunoreactivity of the recombinant protein. The test in both formats had a correlation of approximately 90 % with the Rose Bengal plate agglutination test (RBPT) and a standard tube agglutination test, assays that are routinely performed for the serodiagnosis of brucellosis. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay in the plate format were 97.50 and 85.59 %, and in the dot-blot format were 82.05 and 92.43%, respectively, in comparison with RBPT. The specificity of this assay was further confirmed by testing samples that were positive for malaria and typhoid, which gave negative results. This ELISA system in microtitre plates and a dot-blot format will be useful for the rapid screening of large numbers of samples for the diagnosis of human brucellosis in endemic areas."

During an operational trial at health centers and mobile malaria units where microscopical diagnosis is not available and using defined symptom screening criteria, 3,361 subjects were tested yielding 618 positives (18.4%) for PF-HRP-2 by ParaSight-F. Microscopic examination of the same subjects by thick blood film examined 7 days later at a malaria clinic showed 578 falciparum, and 349 vivax and mixed infection (F+V) 41. The technology proved highly effective in detecting falciparum malaria at the peripheral levels where access to malaria laboratory services are difficult, thus allowing immediate administration of a complete course of treatment in the absence of a microscopic examination."

In dilution assays performed to test sensitivity against known parasite density, Malar-Check were compared with thick blood smear (TBS), the gold standard for diagnosis. Palo Alto isolate or P. falciparum blood from patients with different parasitemias was used. The average cut-off points for each technique in three independent experiments were 12 and 71 parasites/mm3 (TBS and Malar-Check, respectively).

CD011431,0,20665965,0,Quantitative analysis of morphological alterations in Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells through theoretical interpretation of spectral measurements.,"Spectroscopic analysis can provide valuable insights into morphological and biochemical cellular transformations caused by diseases. However, traditional spectroscopic methods and the corresponding spectral interpretation approaches have been challenged by the complexities of the cell shape, orientation, and internal structure. Here we present an elegant spectral interpretation model that enables accurate quantitative analysis of the UV-visible spectra of red blood cells (RBCs) parasitized by the lethal human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The model is based on the modified Mie theory (MMT) approach that incorporates the effects of the nonsphericity and orientation and multilayered cell structure to account for complex composition of the infected RBCs (IRBCs). We determine the structure and composition of the IRBCs and address unresolved matters over the alterations induced by the intraerythrocytic development of P. falciparum. The results indicate deformation and swelling of the IRBCs during the trophozoite stage of P. falciparum that is followed by substantial shrinkage during the schizont stages. We determine that up to 90% depletion of hemoglobin from the RBC cytosol does not lead to a net loss of iron from the infected cells. We quantitatively follow the morphological changes in the parasites during the intraerythrocytic development by applying the interpretation model to the UV-visible spectroscopic measurements of the IRBCs. We expect this method of quantitative spectroscopic characterization of the diseased cells to have practical clinical utility for rapid diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and drug susceptibility testing."

We evaluated the ICT P.f/P.v (ICT-Amrad, Sydney, Australia) and OptiMal (Flow Inc., Portland, Oreg.) assays prospectively for the diagnosis of malaria in 158 specimens from 144 febrile returned travellers in Australia by using expert microscopy and PCR as reference standards. Malaria was diagnosed in 93 specimens from 87 patients by expert microscopy, with 3 additional specimens from recently treated patients testing positive for Plasmodium falciparum by PCR. For the diagnosis of asexual-stage P. falciparum malaria, the sensitivity and specificity of the ICT P.f/P.v assay were 97 and 90%, respectively, and those of the OptiMal assay were 85 and 96%, respectively. The ICT P.f/P.v assay missed one infection with a density of 45 parasites/ micro l, whereas the OptiMal assay missed infections up to 2,500/ micro l; below 1,000/ micro l, its sensitivity was only 43%. For the diagnosis of P. vivax malaria, the sensitivity and specificity of the ICT P.f/P.v assay were 44 and 100%, respectively, and those of the OptiMal assay were 80 and 97%, respectively. Both assays missed infections with parasite densities over 5,000/ micro l: up to 10,000/ micro l with the former and 5,300/ micro l with the latter. Despite the high sensitivity of the ICT P.f/P.v assay for P. falciparum malaria, caution is warranted before RDTs are widely adopted for the diagnosis of malaria in nonimmune patients or in countries where malaria is not endemic."

CD011431,0,1455266,0,Comparison of the quantitative buffy coat technique with the conventional thick blood film technique for malaria case detection in the field.,"The quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique was compared with the conventional thick blood film technique in a malaria survey carried out in a mesoendemic area of malaria in Betau, Pahang, Malaysia. The QBC technique was found to be a rapid technique but had a sensitivity of about 56% and a specificity of 95%, using the thick blood film method as the ""gold standard"". Malaria species identification was unsatisfactory with the QBC technique as it could identify parasites correctly in only about 60% of specimens. It was unable to detect as positive about 58% of specimens which had parasite counts < or = 500 per ul but could detect about 94% of those with counts > 500 per ul. This difference in positive detection rate was significantly different (p < 0.05). It cannot quantify parasitemia easily and the specimens cannot be stored for future reference and for quality control purposes. It is therefore concluded that the QBC technique cannot replace the classical thick blood film technique for use in malaria control programmes. Its use may be appropriate in situations like busy blood banks and outpatient clinics where rapid screening of malaria infection is needed but where experienced malaria microscopists may not be available."

In a previous study, the sensitivities and specificities of LAMP, microscopy, and nested PCR were compared in the context of rapid malaria detection. In the present study, LAMP detected vivax malaria parasites in 115 of 117 microscopically positive samples (sensitivity, 98.3%; 95% CI, 97.4-100%), which agreed well with the nested PCR results (sensitivity, 99.1%; 95% CI: 96.0-100%). No positive cases of malaria were detected by LAMP or nested PCR in 50 consecutive feverish patients other than malaria from malaria endemic areas. LAMP performed on DNA extracted from heat-treated blood had a sensitivity of 93.3% (28/30, 95% CI: 84.4-100%) and specificity of 100% (30/30, 95% CI: 100%). The present study shows that LAMP based assays have high sensitivity, specificity, and amplification efficiencies for Plasmodium vivax detection.

The study was carried out in Buea, South West Province, Cameroon. Subjects consulting at health care facilities in Buea were randomly recruited into the study. A total of 121 febrile patients 1-60 years old comprised the study subjects. Thin and thick blood films were prepared for malaria parasite detection. G-6-P-D enzyme activity was assayed using the met-haemoglobin reduction test. Determination of haemoglobin genotypes was by a rapid screening method alongside electrophoresis. Malaria positive patients were treated. The highest malaria prevalence of 74.5 % was in Group O individuals and the lowest of 58.6% in group B individuals. Mean parasite density (Log(10)(-1)/ul blood) in the various blood groups was not significantly different. Individuals with G-6-P-D deficiency had a significantly lower malaria prevalence (47.5%) when compared with active individuals. Mean parasite density in enzyme deficient and active individuals was 3.7(SD+/- 3.9) and 4.4(SD +/-5.0) respectively and the difference was significant (p < 0.05). Malaria prevalence was lower (57.5%) in HbS individuals when compared with HbAA (74.6%) and HbSS (60%) but parasite density was not significantly different. Our results suggest that individuals with blood group O who have the HbAA genotype and show G-6-P-D enzyme activity may be more susceptible to malaria.

CD011431,0,11548315,0,[Current malaria situation in Turkey].,"Geographically, Turkey is situated in an area where malaria is very risky. The climatic conditions in the region are suitable for the malaria vector to proliferate. Due to agricultural infrastructural changes, GAP and other similar projects, insufficient environmental conditions, urbanization, national and international population moves, are a key to manage malaria control activities. It is estimated that malaria will be a potential danger for Turkey in the forthcoming years. The disease is located largely in south-eastern Anatolia. The Diyarbakir, Batman, Sanliurfa, Siirt, and Mardin districts are the most affected areas. In western districts, like Aydin and Manisa, an increase in the number of indigenous cases can be observed from time to time. This is due to workers moving from malaria districts to western parts to final work. Since these workers cannot be controlled, the population living in these regions get infected from indigenous cases. There were 84,345 malaria cases in 1994 and 82,096 in 1995, they decreased to 60,884 in 1996 and numbered 35,456 in 1997. They accounted for 36,842 and 20,963 in 1998 and 1999, respectively. In Turkey there are almost all cases of P. vivax malaria. There are also P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria cases coming from other countries: There were 321 P. vivax cases, including 2 P. falciparum ones, arriving to Turkey from Iraq in 1995. The P. vivax malaria cases accounted for 229 in 1996, and 67, cases P. vivax including 12 P. falciparum cases, in 1997, and 4 P. vivax cases in 1998 that came from that country. One P. vivax case entered Turkey from Georgia in 1998. The cause of higher incidence of P. vivax cases in 1995, it decreasing in 1999, is the lack of border controls over workers coming to Turkey. The other internationally imported cases are from Syria, Sudan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, India, Azerbaijan, Malaysia, Ghana, Indonesia, Yemen. Our examinations have shown that none of these internationally imported cases are important in transmitting the diseases. The districts where malaria cases occur are the places where population moves are rapid, agriculture is the main occupation, the increase in the population is high and the education/cultural level is low. Within years, the districts with high malaria cases also differ. Before 1990 Cucurova and Amikova were the places that showed the highest incidence of malaria. Since 1990, the number of cases from south-eastern Anatolia has started to rise. The main reasons for this change are a comprehensive malaria prevention programme, regional development, developed agricultural systems, and lower population movements. The 1999 statistical data indicate that 83 and 17% of all malaria cases are observed in the GAP and other districts, respectively. The distribution of malaria cases in Turkey differs by months and climatic conditions. The incidence of malaria starts to rise in March, reaching its peak in July, August and September, begins to fall in October. In other words, the number of malaria cases is lowest in winter and reaches its peak in summer and autumn. This is not due to the parasite itself, but a climatic change is a main reason. In the past years the comprehensive malaria prevention programme has started bearing its fruits. Within the WHO Roll Back Malaria strategies, Turkey has started to implement its national malaria control projects, the meeting held on March 22, 2000, coordinated the country's international cooperation for this purpose. The meeting considered the aim of the project to be introduced into other organizations. In this regards, the target for 2002 is to halve the incidence of malaria as compared to 1999. The middle--and long-term incidence of malaria will be lowered to even smaller figures. The objectives of this project are as follows: to integrate malaria services with primary health care services to prove more effective studies; to develop early diagnosis and treatment systems, to provide better diagnostic services, and to develop mobile diagnostic ones; to make radical treatment and monitoring patients; to conduct regular active case surveillance studies; to conduct regular vector control studies; to monitor the sensitivity of vectors to insecticides and to provide their alternatives; to design malaria control studies for the specialists of districts; to implement educational programmes among the population and attract it in controlling malaria."

Data were compared with those of microscopy. Results revealed that the sensitivity for predicting recrudescence by means of the Determine test after treatment with chloroquine on Day 14 was 75%, with 50% specificity. However, antigenemia was detected in 16% of patients as late as Day 21 in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-treated subjects with a drug-sensitive response. Clearance of parasitemia in thick blood smear and clearance of antigenemia appeared to parallel each other only in arteether-treated subjects. The observed diagnostic trends therefore mean that the potential of the Determine test to detect recrudescent infection is limited."
CD011431,0,14516298,1,Rapid diagnostic testing for malaria.,"Malaria rapid diagnostic devices (MRDD) have been developed with the hope that they would offer accurate, reliable, rapid, cheap and easily available alternatives to traditional methods of malaria diagnosis. The results from early malaria rapid diagnostic studies were quite promising, especially for detecting Plasmodium falciparum at densities of more than 100-500 parasites/microl. Despite the introduction of these devices over a decade ago, only a few target antigens have been introduced. Of greater concern, these devices have shown limitations in sensitivity, ability to differentiate species and robustness under field conditions in the tropics. Recent trials have revealed wide variability in sensitivity both within and between products. We review the recent trials assessing MRDD use for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and non-P. falciparum infections in endemic and non-endemic countries and describe the various aspects of these devices which need further improvement. High quality, accurate, rapid and affordable diagnostic tools are urgently needed now that new antimalarial regimens, characterized by higher cost and increased toxicity, have been introduced more widely in response to emerging multi-drug resistance."

Results were compared with conventional Giemsa-stained blood films. Of 306 people tested 37.9% (116/306) were found to be parasitaemic; of these 66.4% (77/116) were P. vivax and 32.8% (38/116) were P. falciparum infections. There was only one (0.9%) mixed P. falciparum plus P. vivax infection. The RTM test was positive in 35/36 patients with P. falciparum identified on blood smear examination, resulting in a sensitivity of 97.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 91.6-102.8%]. Specificity was 96.3% (95% CI: 93.9-98.6%). The RTM test had a positive predictive value of 77.8% (95% CI: 65.7-89.9%) and a negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI: 98.4-100.8%). Of the 10 false positives, seven reported recent malaria episode and treatment, indicating persistence of antigenaemia. If these were assumed truly infected, the positive predictive value is increased to 93.3% (95% CI: 85.8-100.8%). The RTM test was positive in all seven P. falciparum infections with gametocytes and one mixed infection, but was negative in all falciparum gametocytes and relapsing fever cases. All but one P. vivax infection gave negative result on the RTM test. The RTM test missed one patient with parasitaemia. The test is highly sensitive and specific requiring no instrument or trained personnel. It appears to be a very useful tool for rapid diagnosis of malaria, especially in the rural health institutions with limited diagnostic facilities."

Well-characterized serum samples were obtained from chagasic patients (n = 63), nonchagasic individuals (n = 95), visceral leishmaniasis patients (n = 38), and malaria patients (n = 55). Noncharacterized specimens were obtained from Latin American immigrants and individuals at risk with a clinical and/or epidemiological background: these specimens were recovered serum or plasma samples (n = 450), whole peripheral blood (n = 94), and capillary blood (n = 282). The concordance of the results by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence test was considered to be the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis. Serum and plasma samples were analyzed by Stick Chagas, and whole blood was analyzed by Simple Chagas WB. The sensitivity and specificity of the ICT-Operon in well-characterized samples were 100% and 97.9%, respectively. No cross-reactivity was found with samples obtained from visceral leishmaniasis patients. In contrast, a false-positive result was obtained in 27.3% of samples from malaria patients.

There were 57.1% males and 42.9% females. 55 cases were positive for P. falciparum, 1 case for P. vivax and 1 case was having mixed infection. Average duration of Hospital stay was 2.87 days and average total duration of illness was 6.82 days. The most common presenting symptom was intermittent fever with vomiting & altered sensorium in 38.88% & most common complication was Acute Renal Failure in 45.2% of cases. Paired t-test was applied on the investigations carried out on the day of admission and those carried out on the day or before a day of death and found significant for the levels of Haemoglobin, Blood Urea & Serum Billirubin. Malaria still remains one of the important causes of admission and mortality. In view of changes in anti-malarial drug policy and introduction of costly artemisinin combination therapy accurate, rapid diagnostic tools are necessary to target treatment to people in need."

Blood samples were collected from 6697 patients with fever for > or =3 days for microscopy, culture, and serologic testing and from randomly selected 172 consenting healthy individuals to assess the baseline Widal anti-Typhi O lipopolysaccharide antibody (anti-TO) and anti-Typhi H flagellar antibody (anti-TH) titers. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the 3 serologic tests were calculated using culture-confirmed typhoid fever cases as ""true positives"" and paratyphoid fever and malaria cases as ""true negatives"". Comparing cutoff values for the Widal test, an anti-TO titer of 1/80 was optimal with 58% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 69% PPV, and 77% NPV. Sensitivity was increased to 67% when the Widal test was done on the 5th day of illness and thereafter. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of Typhidot and Tubex were not better than Widal test.

We studied a total of 200 patients, including 62 patients with schistocytosis, 8 postsplenectomy patients, and 108 healthy controls. Peripheral blood (2 microl) was stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated (PE) antihemoglobin antibody (anti-Hb) in 0.6% (w/v) NaCl solution, and analyzed by flow cytometry omitting the washing step. The proportion of RBCs stained by anti-Hb was 0.55% (SD +/-0.23%) in normal controls and was significantly higher in patients with schistocytosis (2.95+/-2.95%, p <0.001). Six of 108 blood samples from normal controls and 60 of 62 samples from schistocytosis patients showed > or =1.01% stained RBCs (ie, values > mean+2SD of normal controls). The number of schistocytes counted by microscopic examination correlated with the proportion of RBCs stained by anti-Hb (r = 0.637, p <0.001). The proportions of stained RBCs in blood samples with malaria, spherocytosis, and elliptocytosis were also significantly higher than in normal controls. However, the results in postsplenectomy and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) patients were not significantly different from the normal controls; the number of schistocytes in postsplenectomy patients was not related to the proportion of RBCs stained by anti-Hb. Based on these findings, flow cytometry of damaged RBCs using anti-Hb in hypotonic solution is a simple, sensitive, and accurate method to detect active hemolysis."

Malaria parasites produce haemozoin, which is able to depolarize light and this allows the automated detection of malaria during routine complete blood count analysis (CBC) with some Abbott Cell-Dyn instruments. In this study, we evaluated the Cell-Dyn CD4000 with 831 blood samples submitted for malaria investigations. Samples were categorized as malaria negative (n = 417), convalescent malaria (n = 64) or malaria positive (n = 350) by reference to thin/thick film microscopy, 'rapid test' procedures, polymerase chain reaction analysis and clinical history. With regard to CD4000 depolarization analysis, a malaria positive CD4000 pattern was ascribed to samples that showed one or more abnormal depolarizing purple events, which corresponded to monocytes containing ingested malaria pigment (haemozoin). Positive CD4000 patterns were observed in 11 of 417, 50 of 64 and 281 of 350 of malaria negative, convalescent malaria and malaria positive samples respectively. The specificity and positive predictive values for malaria (active and convalescent) were very high (97.4 and 96.8%, respectively), while sensitivity and negative predictive values were 80.0 and 83.0% respectively. Depolarization analysis was particularly effective for Plasmodium falciparum malaria but there was lower detection sensitivity for White compared with Black African patients. CD4000 90 degrees depolarization vs 0 degrees analysis revealed a proportion of samples with small nonleucocyte-associated depolarizing particles. Appearance of such events in the form of a discrete cluster was associated with P. vivax rather than P. falciparum infection."

The object of this study is to assess the contribution in the field of two new antimalarial fight steps taken in 2001-2002: The use of the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria OptiMAL in the rural health centres and the drop of the CQ alone for the simultaneous administration of CQ and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. All 581 suspected malaria attacks, diagnosed by RDT during the year 2002 in a rural health centre of the island, were registered. The good positive predictive value of the RDT used (97.2%) calculated during the study has permitted an important reduction of the rate of wrongly administer antimalarial treatment. Before RDT was used, through lack of emergency microscopic diagnosis, the antimalarial treatment was presumptive in the isolated health centres and that rate was superior to 90%. It is now below 3%. Before the introduction of the new protocol, in the middle of the year 2002, the rate of therapeutic failures with CQ used alone was 40.2% (33/82). With the simultaneous administration of CQ and SP as a first-line treatment, this rate fell down to 1.8% (6/337). For the time being, this new treatment policy is acceptable in Mayotte. But the experience of the countries who have adopted this therapeutic policy shows that the effectiveness of the association CQ-SP is likely to be temporary. It is necessary to set up a ""durable long-term"" therapy strategy in Mayotte as soon as possible by adopting as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria a combination therapy according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization. It could be the artemether-lumefantrine combination which has already been the subject of an efficacy survey in the island."
CD011431,0,16912713,0,Ensuring quality and access for malaria diagnosis: how can it be achieved?,"The replacement of conventional antimalarial drugs with high-cost, artemisinin-based alternatives has created a gap in the successful management of malaria. This gap reflects an increased need for accurate disease diagnosis that cannot be met by traditional microscopy techniques. The recent introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has the potential to meet this need, but successful RDT implementation has been curtailed by poor product performance, inadequate methods to determine the quality of products and a lack of emphasis and capacity to deal with these issues. Economics and a desire for improved case management will result in the rapid growth of RDT use in the coming years. However, for their potential to be realized, it is crucial that high-quality RDT products that perform reliably and accurately under field conditions are made available. In achieving this goal, the shift from symptom-based diagnosis to parasite-based management of malaria can bring significant improvements to tropical fever management, rather than represent a further burden on poor, malaria-endemic populations and their overstretched health services."

The ParaSight(R)-F test, which is based on qualitative detection by monoclonal antibody of the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) histidin-rich protein-II in the blood, showed promising results. As some antigens of Pf have been detected in the urine, we assessed the efficiency of the ParaSight(R)-F test in the whole blood and in the urine using microscopy and PCR as gold standards. One hundred and twelve children living in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) were recruited during a cross-sectional community survey. When using microscopy as reference, the ParaSight(R)-F test applied to whole blood had 84% sensitivity and 77% specificity. The semi-quantitative assessment showed that the intensity of the color on the wick correlated with parasite density. The ParaSight(R)-F test performed on urine had 81% sensitivity but only 26% specificity. Very similar results for blood and urine were obtained when using PCR as reference. The present evaluation of the ParaSight(R)-F test applied to blood compares well with findings in endemic areas of Africa or Asia, and confirms its usefulness to diagnose Pf infection in endemic areas of the South Pacific. Because of the lack of specificity, the ParaSight(R)-F test performed on urine cannot be recommended."

To examine the consequences of using RDTs in school surveys, we compared three RDT brands used during a nationwide school survey in Kenya with expert microscopy and investigated the cost implications of using alternative diagnostic approaches in identifying localities with differing levels of infection. Overall, RDT sensitivity was 96.1% and specificity was 70.8%. In terms of classifying districts and schools according to prevalence categories, RDTs were most reliable for the < 1% and > 40% categories and least reliable in the 1-4.9% category. In low-prevalence settings, microscopy was the most expensive approach, and RDT results corrected by either microscopy or polymerase chain reaction were the cheapest. Use of polymerase chain reaction-corrected RDT results is recommended in school malaria surveys, especially in settings with low-to-moderate malaria transmission."

The covalent immobilization of a commercial monoclonal antibody toward the HRP2 protein in magnetic beads and nanoparticles was evaluated and compared. The immunological reaction for the protein HRP2 was successfully performed in a sandwich assay on magnetic micro- and nanoparticles by using a second monoclonal antibody labeled with the enzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Then, the modified magnetic particles were easily captured by a magneto sensor made of graphite-epoxy composite (m-GEC) which was also used as the transducer for the electrochemical detection. The performance of the immunoassay-based strategy with the electrochemical magneto immunosensors was successfully evaluated and compared with a novel magneto-ELISA based on optical detection using spiked serum samples. Improved sensitivity was obtained when using 300 nm magnetic nanoparticles in both cases. The electrochemical magneto immunosensor coupled with magnetic nanoparticles have shown better analytical performance in terms of limit of detection (0.36 ng mL(-1)), which is much lower than the LOD reported by other methods. Moreover, at a low level of HRP2 concentration of 31.0 ng mL(-1), a signal of 15.30 μA was reached with a cutoff value of 0.34 μA, giving a clear positive result with a non-specific adsorption ratio of 51. Due to the high sensitivity, this novel strategy offers great promise for rapid, simple, cost-effective, and on-site detection of falciparum malaria disease in patients, but also to screen out at-risk blood samples for prevention of transfusion-transmitted malaria."
CD011431,0,21207062,0,Prevalence of molecular markers of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during the intermittent preventive treatment in infants coupled with the expanded program immunization in Senegal.,"Several studies have shown the efficacy of the intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) coupled with the expanded program of immunization (EPI) in infants. However, its adoption as a strategy is conditioned by the long-term efficacy of SP. The impact of IPT-SP coupled with the EPI on the prevalence of markers of resistance to SP was evaluated during this study conducted in Southern Senegal. Three cross-sectional surveys in two health districts (IPT+) were conducted prior to the implementation, 1 year, and 2 years after. A third district located between the two districts served as a test zone (IPT-). PCR tests were carried out from filter papers collected in children under five for the two first measures and from positive rapid diagnostic tests in the same population for the third measure. Mutations in codons 51, 59, and 108 of the DHFR gene and in codons 437 and 540 of the DHPS were analyzed. The results showed that the prevalence of DHFR triple mutation was more frequent after 2 years in IPT+ areas. Regarding quadruple mutation, DHFR (51, 59, and 108) and DHPS (437), no difference was noted between the two areas. The quintuple mutation was not observed after 2 years of implementation in both areas. However, an individual analysis showed significant differences in the individual mutation points 51, 59, 108, and 437. This study reveals that despite an increase in the prevalence of individual mutations, the IPT-SP coupled with the EPI has no major impact on DHFR and DHPS combined mutations."

A Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2)-based assay (ICT) and a Plasmodium-specific lactate dehydrogenase test (OptiMAL) were evaluated for their specificities in different groups of patients who tested negative for malaria infection by microscopy. The patients were selected from different disease groups: rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C, toxoplasmosis, schistosomiasis, and hydatid disease. One hundred thirty-three of the 225 patients were positive for rheumatoid factor. Thirty-five of the 133 (26%) rheumatoid factor-positive patients gave a false-positive reaction with the ICT assay, but only 4 of these gave false-positive reactions with the OptiMAL test. Thirty-three of the 35 false-positive specimens became negative when repeat tested with the ICT assay after absorbing out the rheumatoid factor activity.

CD011431,0,16525099,0,Diagnosing infection levels of four human malaria parasite species by a polymerase chain reaction/ligase detection reaction fluorescent microsphere-based assay.,"Improving strategies for diagnosing infection by the four human Plasmodium species parasites is important as field-based epidemiologic and clinical studies focused on malaria become more ambitious. Expectations for malaria diagnostic assays include rapid processing with minimal expertise, very high specificity and sensitivity, and quantitative evaluation of parasitemia to be delivered at a very low cost. Toward fulfilling many of these expectations, we have developed a post-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/ligase detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay (LDR-FMA). This assay, which uses Luminex FlexMAP microspheres, provides simultaneous, semi-quantitative detection of infection by all four human malaria parasite species at a sensitivity and specificity equal to other PCR-based assays. In blinded studies using P. falciparum-infected blood from in vitro cultures, we identified infected and uninfected samples with 100% concordance. Additionally, in analyses of P. falciparum in vitro cultures and P. vivax-infected monkeys, comparisons between parasitemia and LDR-FMA signal intensity showed very strong positive correlations (r > 0.95). Application of this multiplex Plasmodium species LDR-FMA diagnostic assay will increase the speed, accuracy, and reliability of diagnosing human Plasmodium species infections in epidemiologic studies of complex malaria-endemic settings."
CD011431,0,3445339,0,Serodiagnostic assay for visceral leishmaniasis employing monoclonal antibodies.,"A highly specific and sensitive competitive serodiagnostic assay for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was developed using species specific Leishmania donovani monoclonal antibodies. This assay, either RIA or ELISA, is based on the specific inhibition of monoclonal antibody binding to a crude parasite homogenate by serum from patients with VL. 15 monoclonal antibodies were examined. The binding of 13 antibodies was significantly inhibited by VL serum and unaffected by normal serum. 3 species-specific monoclonal antibodies, D-2, D-13 and D-14, which recognize different parasite antigens, were chosen for use in the competitive serodiagnostic assay. In 90% of the positive cases, regardless of geographic origin, VL sera inhibited monoclonal antibody binding to the parasite antigen by more than 30%. No false positive was obtained with sera from Chagas disease, lepromatous leprosy, schistosomiasis, malaria, systemic lupus erythematosus, cutaneous or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, even at serum dilutions (1:100) which cross-react strongly with Leishmania antigen in direct binding assays. Inhibition by negative control sera from areas endemic for VL and from non-endemic areas was negligible. The assay takes less than 24 h, requires minimum amounts of sera or antigen, and is easily standardized allowing interlaboratory comparison of test data. The competitive serodiagnostic assay will be especially useful in areas where Chagas disease is coendemic and the rapid diagnosis of VL by direct binding serodiagnostic assays presents a problem."
CD011431,0,22993409,0,Evaluation of serological diagnostic tests for typhoid fever in Papua New Guinea using a composite reference standard.,"Typhoid fever remains a major global health problem. A major impediment to improving outcomes is the lack of appropriate diagnostic tools, which have not significantly improved in low-income settings for 100 years. We evaluated two commercially available rapid diagnostic tests (Tubex and TyphiDot), a prototype (TyphiRapid TR-02), and the commonly used single-serum Widal test in a previously reported high-burden area of Papua New Guinea. Samples were collected from 530 outpatients with axillary temperatures of ≥37.5°C, and analysis was conducted on all malaria-negative samples (n = 500). A composite reference standard of blood culture and PCR was used, by which 47 participants (9.4%) were considered typhoid fever positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the Tubex (51.1% and 88.3%, respectively) and TyphiDot (70.0% and 80.1%, respectively) tests were not high enough to warrant their ongoing use in this setting; however, the sensitivity and specificity for the TR-02 prototype were promising (89.4% and 85.0%, respectively). An axillary temperature of ≥38.5°C correlated with typhoid fever (P = 0.014). With an appropriate diagnostic test, conducting typhoid fever diagnosis only on patients with high-grade fever could dramatically decrease the costs associated with diagnosis while having no detrimental impact on the ability to accurately diagnose the illness."

A system incorporating heparin, EDTA, and acridine orange into a microhematocrit tube (Quantitative Blood Count, QBC) has been commercially developed for the quantitation of blood counts and has been used for the diagnosis of malaria. We evaluated this test for its usefulness in the diagnosis of filariasis. Upon centrifugation, the parasites were concentrated in the area of the buffy coat and could be observed through the wall of the tube. The parasites were concentrated further by a plastic float that expands the buffy coat and confines the parasites to the periphery of the tube. Acridine orange stains the DNA of the parasite, and morphologic characteristics can be examined by fluorescence microscopy. The terminal and subterminal nuclei and long cephalic space of Brugia malayi, as well as the short cephalic space and caudal nuclei of Wuchereria bancrofti, were easily recognized and differentiated from each other. Microfilariae were detected in samples diluted to a level of approximately 50/ml."
CD011431,0,10546844,1,Comparison of a rapid field immunochromatographic test to expert microscopy for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia in Thailand.,"We assessed a rapid, Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria Pf Test), for detection of asexual P. falciparum parasitemia in 551 subjects in three groups: (1) symptomatic patients self-referring for diagnosis, (2) villagers in a screening survey, and (3) patients recently treated for P. falciparum malaria. Expert light microscopy was the reference standard. ICT test performance was similar for diagnostic and screening modes. Four findings emerged: (1) test sensitivity correlated directly with parasite density, (2) test band intensity correlated directly with parasite density, (3) persistent test positivity after parasite clearance precludes its use for monitoring early therapeutic responses, and (4) a false negative test at 18,000 parasites/microl is unexplained. We conclude that a strong positive ICT test is highly predictive of falciparum asexual parasitemia for the diagnosis of new cases of falciparum malaria in Thailand, but a negative test result is inadequate to exclude parasitemia < 300/microl, and in some instances, even a higher parasitemia."

Parasitaemia was determined daily by comparison with total white blood cell counts (determined by Coulter counter) until no parasite was detected on 2 consecutive days by PTBF. Cumulatively, 231 observations were made with each assay: 64 were negative and 167 positive by PTBF (59 had parasite counts < or = 100/microL). Compared to PTBF, the sensitivities of TBF and the dipstick assay were 1.0 for parasite counts > 100/microL and 0.458 and 0.966 respectively for counts < or = 100/microL. Overall, the dipstick assay was significantly more sensitive (0.988 vs. 0.808; P < 0.001) but less specific (P = 0.013) than TBF. The dipstick assay is of potential use for monitoring response to drug treatment and for detecting low parasitaemias."

We performed a 'blinded' evaluation of a non-isotopic (colourimetric) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay (Digene SHARP Signal System) compared with microscopy and PCR/radiometric probe hybridization of ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes (RPH) for the detection of P. vivax malaria in 182 febrile travellers. Compared with PCR/RPH as the reference standard, the colourimetric assay had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 98%. Using microscopy as the reference standard, 84 of 87 patients with P. vivax infection had a positive colourimetric assay. The 3 patients with a negative assay were subsequently shown to be infected with P. ovale as determined by PCR/RPH. In a subset of patients followed longitudinally, the colourimetric assay was positive in 5 of 13 patients 6 or more days after initiation of therapy. Of these 5 patients, 4 were subsequently demonstrated to be infected with CRPV as determined by treatment failure in vivo and/or chloroquine blood levels. A positive assay result 6 or more days after initiation of therapy was associated with subsequent treatment failure (P < 0.01).

CD011431,0,22369777,0,Autopsy discoveries of death from malaria.,"Malaria inflicts a huge health care burden in terms of mortality and morbidity worldwide. There has been evidence in the literature where many unexpected/unexplained deaths turned out to be related to malaria on autopsy. The aim of this study is to review autopsy diagnosed malaria related deaths in the literature with due stress to its biologic and forensic aspects. A meticulous literature search was performed for ""sudden malaria death"", ""malaria death postmortem diagnosis"" and ""unexplained death malaria"" across PubMed, SCOPUS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Allied and Complementary Medicine, British Nursing Index, CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid-MEDLINE and Google Scholar. All the literature was thoroughly reviewed and analyzed with reference to the type of study, location, travel history, age, gender, circumstance of death, method of diagnosis, species involved, chemoprophylaxis usage and take home message from the particular study. Plasmodium falciparum was responsible in most of the cases. The symptoms mimicked influenza in most of the case reports. Travel to endemic areas was common to most of the victims. The travelers were from all over the world including USA, France, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Asia (China and Japan). Vascular congestion with the presence of malarial pigment laden RBCs in capillaries of various organs was the major histopathology finding. Such lesions were found in the brains of all subjects (100%), liver of 78% of the cases, spleen in 67%, lungs in 56% and myocardium in 43% of the cases. Peripheral smear and rapid diagnostic test was of great aid to the autopsy in many cases. PCR was used for diagnosis as well as exclusion of possibility of co-infection with other species in case of Plasmodium knowlesi related death. The postmortem and histopathology findings in this case were similar to P. falciparum except for the fact that brain sections were negative for intracellular adhesion molecule-1. Chemoprophylaxis was not taken by the victims except for two in whom history of chloroquine based chemoprophylaxis was mentioned. Given the worldwide prevalence of the disease, increasing international travel and rapidly developing drug resistance, malaria will continue to be an important disease and should be considered in all cases of unexpected deaths particularly in malaria endemic regions or in presence of travel history to endemic regions."

CD011431,0,10444878,1,Evaluation of a rapid and inexpensive dipstick assay for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"Rapid, accurate and affordable methods are needed for the diagnosis of malaria. Reported here is an evaluation of a new immunochromatographic strip, the PATH Falciparum Malaria IC Strip, which is impregnated with an immobilized IgM monoclonal antibody that binds to the HRP-II antigen of Plasmodium falciparum. In contrast to other commercially available kits marketed for the rapid diagnosis of falciparum malaria, this kit should be affordable in the malaria-endemic world. Using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods as reference standards, we compared two versions of the PATH test for the detection of P. falciparum infection in 200 febrile travellers. As determined by PCR and microscopy, 148 travellers had malaria, 50 of whom (33.8%) were infected with P. falciparum. Compared with PCR, the two versions of the PATH test had initial sensitivities of 90% and 88% and specificities of 97% and 96%, respectively, for the detection of falciparum malaria. When discrepant samples were retested blindly with a modified procedure (increased sample volume and longer washing step) the sensitivity and specificity of both kits improved to 96% and 99%, respectively. The two remaining false negatives occurred in samples with < 100 parasites per microliter of blood. The accuracy, simplicity and predicted low cost may make this test a useful diagnostic tool in malaria-endemic areas."
CD011431,0,19499726,0,[Update on the epidemiology of malaria in French Guiana].,"The last study describing the epidemiology of malaria in French Guiana was published 20 years ago. Yet French Guiana in the Americas along with Mayotte in the Indian Ocean is the only French territory with persisting endemic malaria. The purpose of this study is to provide an update based on official malaria surveillance data as well as on information from hospital records and various field surveys that have been carried out in recent years. Due to recurrent problems in collecting thorough, continuous, and consistent data, exact determination of incidence by plasmodium species has always been difficult in French Guiana. These problems include not only the remote location of endemic areas and intense unpredictable migration patterns but also poor data collection methods that do not always ensure consistency and homogeneity. Another factor hindering thorough collection of conventional epidemiological data is the requirement for rapid effective treatment in remote regions. The overall incidence of malaria in French Guiana appears to have remained stable since the beginning of the decade with an average of 3,920 case reports per year for an incidence rate of 20 per thousand, noting that three fourths of the 206,000 inhabitants of French Guiana live outside of endemic areas. Overall involvement of P. falciparum and P. vivax appears to be equal with P. malariae accounting for only 2.6% of cases. Trends in recent years indicate an increase in the number of cases involving P. vivax especially in the eastern zones, i.e. in the Oyapock focus where annual incidences in children have reached up to 500 per thousand and in the whole region located between Saint Georges and Cayenne. Conversely a decrease in endemic levels has been observed in western areas, especially for P. falciparum in the upper and middle focuses of the Maroni. Most zones now causing problems are located near migration points, particularly in relation with clandestine gold panning activities. In the coastal strip where the three main cities with most of the population are located, most reported cases are imported but local cases may occur. In general local transmission in these areas has been promptly controlled but trends indicate that incidence of these events may be rising. Anopheles darlingi is still recognized as the main vector but its role in transmission is less obvious in eastern areas where increasing evidence suggests that other species may contribute to maintaining endemic levels. These findings indicate that the extensive resources deployed in this French territory (public financing, health care network, public awareness campaigns, and training of health care personnel in diagnosis and treatment of malaria) have helped reduce the number of severe cases in an unfavorable epidemiological setting."
CD011431,0,9546420,0,Plasma levels of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin in children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Gabon after administration of 50-milligram artesunate suppositories.,"A thermostable suppository of artesunate (artesunic acid) has been developed. In Gabon, 12 children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria received two administrations of this suppository in a 4-hr interval. Parasitemia and fever were then measured and the plasma levels of artesunate and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin, were determined by means of a reversed phase high-pressure liquid chromatography method using reductive electrochemical detection. Substantial parasite clearance (97-100%) was noted 24 hr after the beginning of the treatment and body temperature had returned to normal. Absorption, metabolism, and elimination of artesunate were rapid. Mean values of maximum plasma levels (Cmax) and maximum concentration peak times (tmax) were evaluated. The Cmax of dihydroartemisinin (0.18 +/- 0.10 microg/ml [mean +/- SE]) was higher than the Cmax of artesunate (0.09 +/- 0.04 microg/ml) and the tmax of dihydroartemisinin (1.13 +/- 0.58 hr) was higher than the tmax of artesunate (0.58 +/- 0.19 hr).

CD011431,0,23575041,0,Measuring malaria by passive case detection: a new perspective based on Zambian experience.,"Most measurements of malaria are based on cross-sectional data and do not reflect the dynamic nature of transmission, particularly when interventions require timely data for planning strategies. Such data can be collected from local rural health centres (RHCs) where the infrastructure is sufficiently developed and where rapid diagnostics are in use. Because in rural areas, the population served by RHC is reasonably static, the regular use of malaria rapid diagnosis in RHCs can provide data to assess local weekly incidence rates, and such data are easily dispersed by cell phones. Essentially each RHC is a potential sentinel site that can deliver critical information to programme planners. Data collected during this process of passive case detection over a five-year period in the Macha area of Zambia show the importance of ecological zones and refugia in the seasonal fluctuation of malaria cases. If this process is implemented nationally it can assist in planning efficient use of resources and may contribute to local management and even elimination of malaria in this region."

CD011431,0,23426929,0,High prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in a tribal population in eastern India.,"Asymptomatic infection by Plasmodium falciparum is an important obstacle to eliminating malaria. Asymptomatic carriers do not seek treatment for infection, and therefore they become a reservoir for the parasite. For this reason, these carriers pose a real public health risk. The systematic identification and treatment of asymptomatic infections should reduce the parasite reservoir. A large reduction in this pool will lower the chance of transmission of the disease. In this study, we screened a tribal population of 1,040 individuals in the Purulia district of West Bengal by using a dual-antigen rapid diagnostic kit (RDK), microscopy, and species-specific PCR. All positive individuals were treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) (artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) and followed for 42 days. Polymorphisms in candidate genes were screened by DNA sequencing. A significant proportion (8.4%) of the study population was infected with P. falciparum but showed no clinical manifestations. The PCR method was more sensitive in detecting infection than the RDK or microscopy. The efficacy of the ACT was 97%. In the pfcrt gene, the mutation K76T (the mutated amino acid is indicated by bold type) was found in 100% of the cases. In the pfmdr1 gene, the mutations N86Y and Y184F were noted in 55.5% and 11% of the cases, respectively. Six different haplotypes were identified in the pfdhfr-pfdhps genes. Most importantly, the quintuple mutant A(16)I(51)R(59)N(108)I(164)-S(436)G(437)E(540)A(581)A(613) was found in 10% of the isolates, which is potentially important for the development of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. A significant proportion of the study population harboring P. falciparum does not seek treatment and therefore serves as a reservoir for the parasite, maintaining the natural cycle. If the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) of India is to eliminate malaria, then this hidden parasite burden needs to be addressed properly. Similar study in other parts of the country could help to determine the magnitude of the problem."

The subjects of a recent study in central Sudan, in an area with a low level of Plasmodium falciparum transmission, were 322 individuals who had each presented at one of seven suburban health facilities, complaining of repeated febrile episodes. Although all were found bloodsmear-negative for malarial parasites, all were presumptively diagnosed as cases of malaria and prescribed artemisinin-based combination therapy. When pretreatment samples of blood were, however, checked for P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2, using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and for Plasmodium DNA, using a PCR-based assay, only one (0.03%) of the cases was found RDT-positive and none was found PCR-positive. Although more studies are needed, in different areas and seasons, to see if these results mirror the general situation, it appears that the wide use of PMT in central Sudan, among patients who are bloodsmear-negative, is unjustified, of little, if any, benefit, and a waste of resources that are already limited.

We analyzed data reported as part of surveillance programs run by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC). Malaria cases were diagnosed by blood films, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests. The risk of re-establishment of malaria transmission in Taiwan was assessed. A total of 193 malaria cases were included in our analysis. All of the cases were associated with importation. One hundred and fifty-eight cases (82%) were diagnosed within 13 days from the start of symptoms/signs, and 44% of these cases were acquired in Africa and 42% were acquired in Asia. Plasmodium falciparum was responsible for the majority (49%) of these cases. Travel to an endemic area was associated with the acquisition of malaria. The malaria importation rate was 2.77 per 1,000,000 travelers (range, 1.35-5.74). The reproductive number under control (R(c)) was 0. No endemic transmission of malaria in Taiwan was identified. This study suggests that maintaining a vigilant surveillance system, environmental management, vector-control efforts, and case management are needed to prevent outbreaks and sustain the eradication of malaria in Taiwan."
CD011431,0,11441695,0,[Malaria--rapid diagnostic tests and emergency self-medication].,"WHO recommendations have adopted the option of stand-by emergency treatment (SBT) for travellers to areas where malaria is endemic and medical attention may not be obtained within 24 hours after onset of symptoms. Indication and choice of drugs for SBT depend on use and kind of a chemoprophylactic regimen, situation of plasmodial resistance at the destination, and contraindications and tolerability in the individual traveller. However, the diagnosis of malaria on clinical grounds alone is unreliable, and fever occurs frequently during travel to malaria endemic areas from various reasons. The possibility of malaria has to be considered in all cases of unexplained fever that starts after the 7th day of stay in an endemic area. Studies in European travellers have shown that only 0.5-1.4% of all travellers to whom SBT medication has been prescribed, will finally use it. SBT use in febrile travellers (8.1-10.4% of all travellers) has been 4.9-17%, but plasmodial infection could be confirmed retrospectively in 10.8-16.7% of SBT-users only. The recent introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for malaria has provided a potential tool to self-diagnose and treat a possible malaria attack when medical attention or microscopic diagnosis is not available. However, the utilisation of currently available RTDs by travellers has been shown to be technically problematic. Healthy volunteers were able to learn how to perform the tests, especially when standard written instructions were supplemented with verbal information (75 vs. 90% successful performance). But their interpretation of test results was unsatisfactory, with a high rate of false-negatives (14.1%). In another study in febrile European tourists in Kenya, only 68% of patients were able to perform the RDTs correctly, and 10 out of 11 with microscopically confirmed malaria failed to diagnose themselves accurately. Thus, besides appropriate training before departure, technical improvements are required before such RDT kits can be recommended for self-use by travellers."

Recent studies have shown that human infection with P. knowlesi is widely distributed in forested areas of Southeast Asia. In the present study, we evaluated commercial rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for human malaria to assess their reactivity and sensitivity in detecting P. knowlesi parasites using blood samples obtained from infected monkeys. The blood samples were assayed using two commercial RDTs based on immunochromatographic assays: (i) the OptiMAL-IT, designed to detect parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) of both P. falciparum and other plasmodia, and (ii) the Entebe Malaria Cassette (MC), designed to detect P. falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and P. vivax-specific pLDH. Interestingly, when the P. knowlesi-infected blood samples were examined with the RDTs, OptiMAL test results were interpreted as falciparum malaria-positive, while Entebe MC test results were interpreted as vivax malaria-positive. The sensitivities of both tests in detecting P. knowlesi parasite were similar to those for P. falciparum and higher than P. vivax. Thus, commercial RDTs based on detection of pLDH should be used with great caution, and should not replace conventional microscopy in the diagnosis of suspected cases of P. knowlesi malaria."

CD011431,0,19724695,0,Imported malaria in United Arab Emirates: evaluation of a new DNA extraction technique using nested PCR.,"Local malaria transmission in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) came to an end in 1997. Nevertheless, UAE has been subjected to substantial importation of malaria cases from abroad, concerning both UAE nationals and immigrants from malarious countries with a total number of 2,119 cases in 2007. To evaluate a new DNA extraction technique using nested PCR, blood samples were collected from 132 individuals who presented to Infectious Diseases Department in Rashid Hospital, Dubai, and Central Department of Malaria Control with fever and persistent headache. Giemsa-stained blood films and ELISA test for malaria antibodies were carried out for detection of Plasmodium infection. Plasmodium infections were identified with the genus-specific primer set and species differentiation using nested PCR. A rapid procedure for diagnosis of malaria infections directly from dried blood spots using for the first time DNA extract from FTA Elute cards was evaluated in contrast to extraction techniques using FTA classic cards and rapid boiling technique. Our new simple technique for DNA extraction using FTA Elute cards was very sensitive giving a sensitivity of 100% compared to 94% using FTA classic cards and 62% in the rapid boiling technique. No complex preparation of blood samples was required prior to the amplification. The production cost of DNA isolation in our PCR assay was much less in comparable to that of other DNA extraction protocols. The nested PCR detected plasmodial infection and could differentiate P. falciparum from P. vivax, and also detected the mixed infection."
CD011431,0,17568930,0,Urban malaria in the Brazilian Western Amazon Region I: high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers in an urban riverside district is associated with a high level of clinical malaria.,"Cross sectional studies on malaria prevalence was performed in 2001, 2002, and 2004 in Vila Candelária, an urban riverside area of Porto Velho, Rondônia, in the Brazilian Western Amazon, followed by longitudinal surveys on malaria incidence. Vila Candelária is a working class district, provided with electricity, water supply, and basic sanitation. Previous preliminary surveys indicated high malaria incidence in this community. At the end of year 2000 regular diagnostic and treatment measures for malaria were introduced, with active search of febrile cases among residents. Despite of both rapid treatment of cases and relative good sanitary and housing conditions, the malaria incidence persisted at high levels during the following years with an annual parasite index of 150 to 300/1000 inhabitants. Parasite surveys in 2001, 2002, and 2004 achieved through microscopy and polymerase chain reaction to diagnose malaria showed a constant high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers for both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax parasites. It was concluded that asymptomatic carriers represent an important reservoirs of parasites and that the carriers might contribute to maintaining the high level of transmission. Comparing our findings to similar geo-demographic situations found in other important urban communities of the Brazilian Amazon, we propose that asymptomatic carriers could explain malaria's outbreaks like the one recently observed in Manaus."

It occurs acutely and progresses rapidly to cause irreversible necrosis of tissue following which debridement or amputation is inevitable. We present a case of malaria complicated by SPG. A 54-year old male developed SPG two days after he was diagnosed with severe malaria and treated with intravenous quinine. Despite intervention quad-amputation was necessary as the gangrene had involved all four limbs. SPG secondary to malaria is caused by obstruction of arterioles following sequestration of parasite infected erythrocytes. This is extremely rare, hence almost never anticipated during management of malaria patients. Furthermore due to its rapid progression, it is almost always detected at an advanced irreversible stage. Physicians managing malaria should therefore be vigilant, and look out for SPG, as its prognosis is dependent on correct and timely intervention."

Treatment based on syndromic approach has been found to be costly, and contributes to the development of drug resistance, while microscopic diagnosis of malaria is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Also, there is lack of trained microscopists and reliable equipment especially in rural areas of Nigeria. However, although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have improved the ease of appropriate diagnosis of malaria diagnosis, the cost-effectiveness of RDTs in case management of malaria has not been evaluated in Nigeria. The study hence compares the cost-effectiveness of RDT versus syndromic diagnosis and microscopy."
CD011431,0,18228555,0,Simplified cytometry for routine monitoring of infectious diseases.,"The interacting epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria in resource-poor areas of the world have created a critical need for rapid, simple, affordable apparatus and tests that will permit patients with these diseases to be promptly diagnosed and properly managed. As documented in the current issue of Clinical Cytometry, complex flow cytometric analyses used in affluent countries for CD4+ T cell counting in HIV/AIDS have been simplified, introduced, and quality assessed in resource-restricted countries of Africa and the Caribbean, where simple gating protocols such as panleucogating now provide accurate and precise CD4+ T cell counts on a large scale. CD4/CD8 ratios in infants may replace more expensive molecular tests for HIV infection; simplified flow cytometry is also compatible with HIV viral load-associated lymphocyte activation tests and with antigen-specific cellular immune response assays that rapidly diagnose active TB in both HIV-negative and HIV-TB co-infected individuals. In addition, it is becoming evident that smaller, much less expensive fluorescence imaging cytometers can be used for CD4 counting, immunophenotyping, and hematology and for other applications such as diagnosis and drug-susceptibility testing of TB and diagnosis of malaria. With the gradual, organized expansion of the much-needed diagnostic networks in the underprivileged countries, the most cost-effective apparatus may be one capable of performing tests for all the three diseases mentioned. The most sustainable systems will be those that can be assembled and maintained, to the greatest extent possible, in the countries where they will be used."

Epidemic typhus should be systematically suspected in certain epidemiological conditions: famine, war, high-density populations (refugee camps, prisons), the presence of body louse in the clothing, and in the presence of certain clinical findings: severe infectious syndrome (temperature above 38 C), severe pain and muscle weakness, with coughing and severe neurological signs. The rapid diagnosis and treatment of typhus are essential. The prognosis has improved, thanks to the specific antibiotics that are currently available, particularly doxycycline, prescribed as a single oral dose of 200 mg for adults or of 100 mg for children. However, the prognosis still depends to a large extent on the speed of diagnosis. Typhus epidemics could be effectively predicted and limited if the measures for control of the body louse recommended by the World Health Organization were applied in the areas with the most favorable epidemiological conditions."

Presumptive treatment of malaria is widely practised where microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are not readily available. With the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for treatment of malaria in many low-resource settings, there is need to target treatment to patients with parasitologically confirmed malaria in order to improve quality of care, reduce over consumption of anti-malarials, reduce drug pressure and in turn delay development and spread of drug resistance. This study evaluated the effect of malaria RDTs on health workers' anti-malarial drug (AMD) prescriptions among outpatients at low level health care facilities (LLHCF) within different malaria epidemiological settings in Uganda."

Remote rural populations are particularly vulnerable to the sudden influx of men, materials and money, and associated population mixing that accompany project construction phases. Two large-scale baseline health surveys, carried out in 2001/2002 in two communities that were affected by the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric project in central Lao PDR, were analysed. For the population to be resettled on the Nakai plateau it was observed that access to clean water and basic sanitation facilities was lacking. Faecal examinations revealed a high infection prevalence for Ascaris lumbricoides (67.7%), but relatively low prevalences for hookworm (9.7%), Taenia spp. (4.8%), Enterobius vermicularis (4.4%), Trichuris trichiura (3.9%), Strongyloides stercoralis (1.4%) and Opisthorchis viverrini (0.9%). For the population in the Xe Bang Fai downstream area, rapid diagnostic tests for malaria carried out in the rainy season found a prevalence below 1%, which might be explained by the complete coverage of households with insecticide-treated nets (99.8%). Anthropometric measurements in both populations suggest that wasting, stunting and underweight in under 5-year-old children were moderate to high; 15.9-17.5%, 40.4-55.7% and 35.8-55.7%, respectively. One out of six individuals aged above 14 years were malnourished, most likely as a result of early childhood wasting. Moderate anaemia, assessed by age- and sex-specific haemoglobin levels, was present in 43.8% (Nakai) and 54.9% of the individuals examined (Xe Bang Fai). Several indicators were extracted that can be utilised for monitoring changes in health, well-being and equity, as the project is implemented and operated."

The need for immunodiagnostic tests varies with each infection but is of paramount importance in those infections that cannot be parasitologically diagnosed readily such as toxoplasmosis, pneumocystosis, Chagas' disease, trichinosis, hydatidosis, cysticercosis, and visceral larva migrans. Immunoassays are also needed for those worldwide highly prevalent infections with severe morbidity to be used in seroepidemiology and in the follow-up evaluation of control programs. The most important are malaria, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and trypanosomiasis. Major advances have been made in the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a practical and rapid test for use in endemic countries and in the identification and isolation of diagnostic parasite antigens aided in particular by the use of monoclonal antibodies.

CD011431,0,20932605,0,[Clinical microbiology laboratory and imported parasitic diseases].,"Imported parasitosis represents an increasingly frequent diagnostic challenge for microbiology laboratories. A surge in immigration and international travel has led to a rise in the number of imported cases of parasitosis, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. The present article addresses this challenge by reviewing recommended diagnostic approaches and tests. Currently, microscopy is always recommended when analysing blood samples for parasites. If malaria is suspected, rapid antigen testing (including at least HRP2 antigen) should also be performed. The work-up for suspected leishmaniasis should include serology, culture, and in selected cases detection of antigen in urine. In suspected Chagas disease, two different serological tests should be performed. PCR for blood protozoa is highly sensitive, although it cannot be used to rule out Chagas disease, since this condition may be present without parasitemia. Accurate diagnosis of intestinal amebiasis usually requires PCR or antigen detection tests. In helminthiasis, traditional microscopy may need to be complemented with other tests, such as agar plate culture for strongyloidiasis, Og4C3 antigen detection for bancroftian filariasis, and antibody detection test for filariasis and schistosomiasis."

CD011431,0,23339668,0,PfHPRT: a new biomarker candidate of acute Plasmodium falciparum infection.,"Plasmodium falciparum is a protozoan parasite that causes human malaria. This parasitic infection accounts for approximately 655,000 deaths each year worldwide. Most deaths could be prevented by diagnosing and treating malaria promptly. To date, few parasite proteins have been developed into rapid diagnostic tools. We have combined a shotgun and a targeted proteomic strategy to characterize the plasma proteome of Gambian children with severe malaria (SM), mild malaria, and convalescent controls in search of new candidate biomarkers. Here we report four P. falciparum proteins with a high level of confidence in SM patients, namely, PF10_0121 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, pHPRT), PF11_0208 (phosphoglycerate mutase, pPGM), PF13_0141 (lactate dehydrogenase, pLDH), and PF14_0425 (fructose bisphosphate aldolase, pFBPA). We have optimized selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays to quantify these proteins in individual patients. All P. falciparum proteins were higher in SM compared with mild cases or control subjects. SRM-based measurements correlated markedly with clinical anemia (low blood hemoglobin concentration), and pLDH and pFBPA were significantly correlated with higher P. falciparum parasitemia. These findings suggest that pHPRT is a promising biomarker to diagnose P. falciparum malaria infection. The diagnostic performance of this marker should be validated prospectively."

The QBC technique was found to be a rapid technique with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 94%. Malaria species identification was also possible. It was essentially very useful to detect parasites below < or = 100 parasites/ul of blood by QBC technique. However, quantification of parasitaemia could not be made using this technique. Many cases of carriers having very few gametocytes in their blood were also identified. It is therefore, concluded that the QBC technique, may be appropriate for screening populations for malaria and for detection of asymptomatic carriers to control further transmission of the disease in the community."

OptiMal performed with 76.2% sensitivity and 99.7% specificity (539 patients tested of whom 130 had falciparum malaria). In follow-up investigations, HRP-2 did not appear to be a useful antigen due to its long half-life, whereas pLDH offers a reasonable correlation with the presence of viable parasites in those cases initially detected. We therefore conclude that a combination of both antigens might be the best option for creating a reliable RDT for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria."

Two types of RDT were used separately. The dipstick (Optimal-I) that detects circulating pLDH was tested in 168 patients with clinically suspected malaria (fever or recent history of fever) at primary health centers. Microscopy confirmed malaria in 93/168 (55.4%) cases. Monoparasitic P. falciparum infection was identified in 86/93, P. malariae in 3/93, P. vivax in 3/93 and P. ovale in 1/93. A positive Optimal-I test was a highly sensitive indicator of P. falciparum infection with parasitemia exceeding 500 trophozoites/mul (sensitivity of 97.2%; with a specificity of 100%); it also confirmed 6/7 cases of non-P. falciparum malaria. A community malaria survey used the Malaria Hexagon dipstick (detecting P. falciparum-specific HRP2) for 273 patients: 17 (6.2%) RDT tests were positive, and 16 (5.9%) microscopic tests. Although this dipstick did not detect the only case of infection with P. vivax, its specificity was 100% for detection of P. falciparum infection. Installing microscopes and qualified microscopists in the health centers of the one hundred and eleven districts in Madagascar would be extremely difficult, but our results show that RDT is an effective alternative diagnostic tool for daily use as well as for sporadic malaria epidemics. The revised antimalarial treatment policy, involving a drug ten to twenty times more expensive than chloroquine, demonstrates the need to improve malaria diagnosis: presumptive treatment has become prohibitively expensive. RDT can be used to improve malaria case management at the primary heath centers in Madagascar. We discuss the choice of RDTs."
CD011431,0,8112044,0,Rapid diagnosis of malaria by use of fluorescent probes.,"Malaria diagnosis relies on observation of parasites in blood smears and the Giemsa-stained thick blood smear (G-TS) is the reference test. Diagnosis by G-TS in low-density infections requires long periods of observation and experienced microscopists. Examination of Giemsa-stained thin smears enables more reliable differentiation of species but may miss low-grade infections. Fluorescent stains may offer an alternative technique. We compared the Giemsa technique with 4,6-diamidine-2-phenilindolo-propidium iodide (DAPI-PI) stainings in order to evaluate the time required for diagnosis. A Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood specimen was diluted to obtain concentrations ranging from 6192 to 24 parasites/microliters (p/microliter), and thin and thick smears were stained with the two methods. The DAPI-PI proved useful: parasites were easily recognized and their morphology was preserved in thin and thick smears. The method allowed more rapid evaluation of thin smears as compared with Giemsa staining and enabled recognition of parasites in case of low-level parasitemias. The DAPI-PI staining technique may acquire an important role in malaria diagnosis, especially in nonendemic countries where technicians are not experienced with G-TS; in developing countries, it could be used in epidemiologic surveys of populations with low-density parasitemias, for which it enables a fast examination of smears and possibly the identification of parasite species."

An additional 14 countries are in the process of changing their malaria treatment policy. Studies in non-immune travellers confirm a rapid parasite clearance time and very low rate of side effects. Outpatient clinics and hospitals in non-endemic countries should have standard operating procedures for diagnosing and managing patients with malaria. In this setting, artemisinin combinations should be available for treatment of uncomplicated malaria as they are clearly superior to any other oral antimalarial in their fast reduction of parasite biomass and in decreasing clinical symptoms. Also, they are the drugs of choice for travellers who are advised to carry stand-by emergency treatment during their journey."

The PCR assay can be completed in one hour and has the potential to detect and identify four species of Plasmodium in a single reaction by use of melting temperature curve analysis (however, we did not detect Plasmodium ovale in this study). Blood was collected, stored, and transported on IsoCode STIX, which provide a stable matrix for the archiving and rapid simple extraction of DNA. A genus-specific primer set corresponding to the 18S ribosomal RNA was used to amplify the target sequence. Fluorescence resonance energy technology hybridization probes were designed for P. falciparum over a region containing basepair mismatches, which allowed differentiation of the other Plasmodium species. The PCR results correlated with the microscopic results in 282 (95%) of 297 patient specimens. Most of these were single-species infections caused by P. vivax (150) and P. falciparum (120), along with 5 P. malariae, 2 mixed infections (P. falciparum and P. vivax), and 5 negative specimens. No negative microscopy specimens were positive by PCR (100% specificity for detection of any Plasmodium). The 15 discrepant results could not be resolved, but given the subjective nature of microscopy and the analytical objectivity of the PCR, the PCR results may be correct. The ability of the PCR method to detect mixed infections or to detect P. ovale could not be determined in this study. Within the limitations of initial equipment costs, this real-time PCR assay is a rapid, accurate, and efficient method for the specific diagnosis of malaria. It may have application in clinical laboratories, as well as in epidemiologic studies and antimalarial efficacy trials."
CD011431,0,16282293,1,Evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test for assessing the burden of malaria at delivery in India.,"All pregnant women who came for delivery at a district hospital in Mandla and a civil hospital in Maihar were screened for Plasmodium falciparum (placental parasitemia using a rapid test and microscopy and peripheral and umbilical cord parasitemia using microscopy alone). Two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), Paracheck Pf and ParaHITf, were used. At Mandla, the sensitivity and specificity of the Paracheck Pf for P. falciparum were 93% and 84%, respectively. The positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were 50% and 99%, respectively. At Maihar, the sensitivity and specificity of the ParaHITf for P. falciparum were 87.5% and 97%, respectively. The PPVs and NPVs were 75.4% and 98.7%, respectively. Placental infection was significantly associated with low birth weight. The RDTs for the identification of P. falciparum were more sensitive in placental blood than the placental blood smear by microscopy. Thus, the RDTs should be useful for rapid assessment of malaria at delivery."

CD011431,0,15550304,0,Aggressive active case detection: a malaria control strategy based on the Brazilian model.,"Since 1996, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has adopted a malaria control strategy known as aggressive active case detection (AACD) in which most or all members of every community are tested and treated for malaria on a monthly basis. The strategy attempts to identify and treat cases of asymptomatic malaria, which, if untreated, continue to transmit the infection. Malaria remains uncontrolled because almost all health care systems in the world rely on passive case detection: the treatment of only symptomatic cases of malaria. Research has shown conclusively that asymptomatic cases exist in any population where malaria transmission is stable and incidence is high: therefore passive case detection simply will not succeed in breaking the cycle of transmission. Numerous case studies show that malaria has been successfully controlled on a regional or national level by mass blood surveys. AACD is an effective malaria control strategy if used in conjunction with other methods, especially when (1) an effective treatment exists, (2) influx of potential carriers of the infection can be monitored, and (3) people are inclined to cooperate with monthly blood testing. AACD requires access to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), microscopy supplies, extensive human resources, and prompt, affordable, and effective treatment. AACD is compared to PCD in terms of clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness in a case study of malaria in the Brazilian Yanomami Indians. Where it is feasible, AACD could drastically reduce the incidence of malaria and should be an integral part of the World Health Organization's Roll Back Malaria strategy."

This paper presents the application of such a diagnostic approach to the coverage of prompt and effective treatment of children with fever in rural Senegal."
CD011431,0,10163571,0,Economic implications of resistance to antimalarial drugs.,"The widespread evolution of drug resistance in malarial parasites has seriously hampered efforts to control this debilitating disease. Chloroquine, the mainstay of malaria treatment for many decades, is now proving largely ineffective in many parts of the world, particularly against the most severe form of malaria--falciparum. Alternative drugs have been developed, but they are frequently less safe and are all between 50 and 700% more expensive than chloroquine. Choice of drug clearly has important budgetary implications and national malaria control programmes need to weigh up the costs and benefits in deciding whether to change to more effective but more expensive drugs. The growth in drug resistance also has implications for the choice of diagnostic tool. Clinical diagnosis of malaria is relatively cheap, but less specific than some technological approaches. As more expensive drugs are employed, the cost of wasted treatment on suspected cases who do not in fact have malaria rises and the more worthwhile it becomes to invest in more specific diagnostic techniques. This paper presents an economic framework for analysing the various malaria drug and diagnostic tool options available. It discusses the nature of the key factors that need to be considered when making choices of malaria treatment (including treatment costs, drug resistance, the costs of treatment failure and compliance) and diagnosis (including diagnosis cost and accuracy, and the often overlooked costs associated with delayed treatment), and uses some simple equations to illustrate the impact of these on the relative cost effectiveness of the alternatives being considered. On the basis of some simplifying assumptions and illustrative calculations, it appears that in many countries more effective drugs and more specific and rapid diagnostic approaches will be worth adopting even although they imply additional expense."
CD011431,0,15228812,1,Relative utility of dipsticks for diagnosis of malaria in mesoendemic area for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax in northeastern India.,"For diagnosis of malaria, popular brands of rapid test kits collectively termed as ""dipsticks"" were subject to field evaluation in northeastern India for their comparative sensitivity and specificity vis-à-vis conventional microscopic results. Dipsticks based on Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein (Pf HRP-2) antigen capture assay revealed 100% sensitivity and high specificity (94-100%); thus, they were concluded to be reliable tools for confirmed diagnosis of malarial infection. However, an advanced version of the same kit, having incorporated additional pan-malarial monoclonal antibody, was found to be less sensitive (71%) for non-falciparum infections. Besides, Pf HRP-2-based kits continued to show positive results up to day 7, even after clearance of parasitemia on account of persistent antigenemia. This very limitation seemed to have been overcome by parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) enzyme-based kit. This kit was observed to have high sensitivity (81-89%) and specificity (100%) for both falciparum and non-falciparum malaria, but cannot distinguish mono-infection from mixed infections. It is concluded that the rational use of these kits would accord health benefits in terms of early detection and prompt treatment, reduce drug pressure, and possibly delay the emergence and spread of multi-drug-resistant strains of malarial parasites."
CD011431,0,12848724,0,Current strategies to avoid misdiagnosis of malaria.,"Malaria remains the most important parasitic disease, and tens of thousands of cases are imported into non-endemic countries annually. However, any single institution may see only a very few cases-this is probably the reason why laboratory and clinical misdiagnosis may not be uncommon. In the laboratory, unfamiliarity with microscopic diagnosis may be the main reason, considering the large number of laboratory staff who provide on-call services, often without expert help at hand, as well as the difficulty in detecting cases with low-level parasitemia. Staff should therefore be provided with continuing microscopic training to maintain proficiency. The complementary use of immunochromatographic rapid detection tests (RDTs) may be useful, especially during on-call hours, although, in order to ensure correct interpretation, their inherent limitations have to be well known. Diagnosis based on the polymerase chain reaction is still unsuitable for routine use, due to its long turnaround time, its cost, and its unavailability outside regular hours, although it may be helpful in selected cases. Once the alert clinician has considered the possibility of malaria, and suspicion continues to be high, malaria can be excluded by repeat smears or RDTs. However, the absence of clinical suspicion may not be infrequent, and may have more serious consequences. Depending on the local number of malaria cases seen, laboratory staff should have a low threshold for the decision to perform unsolicited malaria diagnostic tests on suspicious samples, especially if other laboratory tests are abnormal (e.g. thrombocytopenia, presence of atypical lymphocytes, or raised lactate dehydrogenase). The detection of intraleukocytic hemozoin during automated full blood counts is a promising new way to avoid misdiagnosis of clinically unsuspected malaria."
CD011431,0,21520652,0,[Value of rapid tests for diagnosis of malaria in Benin].,"Reliable diagnosis of malaria is essential in malaria endemic areas. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of rapid diagnostic tests to that of the thick and thin blood smear techniques conventionally used for diagnosis of malaria. A total of 84 patients presenting malaria symptoms were included and tested for malaria. Results of blood smears and rapid tests performed blindly in external labs were compared with results of blood smears and PCR done in our reference laboratory. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were determined using PCR as the gold standard. Results of the rapid diagnostic test were much better than those of the microscopic technique performed in external labs, particularly with regard to true positivity. The blood smear technique in external labs led to 12 false positive diagnoses and was associated with a lower positive predictive value than the rapid test: 58.6% vs. 85.7%. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test were also higher than those obtained in external laboratories using blood smear techniques: 90.0% and 95.3% respectively versus 85.0% and 81.2% respectively. The results of this study indicate that the rapid test is more reliable than microscopy and that its use would improve malaria diagnosis. Risks factors for false diagnosis and limitations of the different diagnostic techniques are discussed."
CD011431,0,21743244,0,Acute renal failure in Yemeni patients.,"Acute renal failure (ARF) is defined as a rapid decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, occurring over a period of hours to days. The Science and Technology University Hospital, Sana'a, is a referral hospital that caters to patients from all parts of Yemen. The aim of this study is to have a deeper overview about the epidemiological status of ARF in Yemeni patients and to identify the major causes of ARF in this country. We studied 203 patients with ARF over a period of 24 months. We found that tropical infectious diseases constituted the major causes of ARF, seen in 45.3% of the patients. Malaria was the most important and dominant infectious disease causing ARF. Hypotension secondary to infection or cardiac failure was seen in 28.6% of the patients. Obstructive nephropathy due to urolithiasis or prostate enlargement was the cause of ARF in a small number of patients. ARF was a part of multi-organ failure in 19.7% of the patients, and was accompanied by a high mortality rate. Majority of the patients were managed conservatively, and only 39.9% required dialysis. Our study suggests that early detection of renal failure helps improve the outcome and return of renal function to normal. Mortality was high in patients with malaria and in those with associated hepatocellular failure."
CD011431,0,8649265,0,Randomised trial of SPf66 vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in southern Tanzania.,"Malaria, especially that due to Plasmodium falciparum, is one of the most important parasitic disease in man. It causes more than 400 million cases per year and between 1 to 3 million deaths, mainly among young children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. The current malaria control strategies using rapid diagnosis and treatment as well as methods to reduce the man-vector contact have had limited success. In Kilombero district (Southern Tanzania), malaria transmission is perennial (parasite prevalence > or = 80% all year) and intense (approximatively 300 infectious bites per year). At the household level, each under-5 child suffers on average 3 clinical fever episodes per year. Minimum estimated community rates for serious malaria (cerebral malaria or malaria and anaemia) affect approximatively 5% of all children. Under conditions of a field experiment, the annual incidence of a febrile illness (axillary temperature > or = 37.5 degrees C) reported to the curative primary health services in each child was 0.86 of which 0,35 can be attributed to Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

CD011431,0,20046181,1,Role of immunochromatographic test for rapid diagnosis of malaria.,"The study was conducted to compare among the different diagnostic procedures for malaria in the department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh during the period from July 2005 to June 2006. In this study a total of 98 malaria patients were included as cases. Another 30 age and sex matched healthy people were included as controls. Blood sample from each of the case and control was collected and examined for malarial parasite by microscopic examination of peripheral blood film. Subsequently antigen and antibody were detected by immuno-chromatographic test (ICT). Out of 98 clinically suspected cases 59(60.20%) were positive for malarial parasite by microscopic examination of peripheral blood film, 57(58.16%) were positive by ICT for antigen and 58(59.19%) were positive by ICT for antibody. Sensitivity and specificity of ICT for antigen were 93.22% and 94.87% respectively. For antibody, sensitivity and specificity were 89.83% and 87.17% respectively. From this study, sensitivity and specificity of ICT for malaria was found quite satisfactory, so it is suggested that ICT for malaria could be an alternative to peripheral blood film for the diagnosis of malaria where parasite could not be detected in peripheral blood film."

Thin stained blood smear microscopical examination remains the reference method of diagnosis; however its performance is linked to the professional competence of the biologists. Thus easier methods have been developed (QBC test). Some of them, limited to the diagnosis of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum do not require highly skilled personal to perform or interpret (antigen detection on dipsticks, tests Parasight or cardboard, ICT Malaria Pf), but limitations and errors occurred. These different tests must be complementary methods of traditional diagnosis. In association with microscopical examinations, they provide rapid and efficient diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas.

CD011431,0,17003770,0,Ensuring quality and access for malaria diagnosis: how can it be achieved?,"The replacement of conventional antimalarial drugs with high-cost, artemisinin-based alternatives has created a gap in the successful management of malaria. This gap reflects an increased need for accurate disease diagnosis that cannot be met by traditional microscopy techniques. The recent introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has the potential to meet this need, but successful RDT implementation has been curtailed by poor product performance, inadequate methods to determine the quality of products and a lack of emphasis and capacity to deal with these issues. Economics and a desire for improved case management will result in the rapid growth of RDT use in the coming years. However, for their potential to be realized, it is crucial that high-quality RDT products that perform reliably and accurately under field conditions are made available. In achieving this goal, the shift from symptom-based diagnosis to parasite-based management of malaria can bring significant improvements to tropical fever management, rather than represent a further burden on poor, malaria-endemic populations and their overstretched health services."

Zambia is piloting the use of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) by community health workers (CHWs) to treat uncomplicated malaria. Valid concerns about potential overuse of AL could be addressed by the use of malaria rapid diagnostics employed at the community level. Currently, CHWs in Zambia evaluate and treat children with suspected malaria in rural areas, but they refer children with suspected pneumonia to the nearest health facility.

In total, 522 febrile patients were screened for falciparum malaria by rapid diagnostic assays. Of 81 patients (15.5% prevalence) who were positive by the assays and microscopy, 48 were eligible to participate in the 28-day trial. Nine patients defaulted. Chloroquine cured 54% (95% confidence interval, 45.8-61.8) of falciparum-infected patients. Of 18 (46%) patients with treatment failure, 13 (72%) experienced high-grade resistance. Polymorphisms in cg2 and the N86Y mutation in PfMDR1 were not predictive of treatment outcome. A mutation in PfCRT (K76T) was perfectly associated with in vivo chloroquine resistance. However, K76T was also present in in vivo-sensitive isolates, which suggests that the presence of this mutation was necessary, but not sufficient, to predict in vivo outcome in this cohort."

CD011431,0,18707548,0,Utilization of monoclonal antibodies for detection of Plasmodium falciparum antigen in cerebrospinal fluid of cerebral malaria patients.,"A uniform protein profile of bands at 34, 43, and 52 kDa was obtained with all the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of malaria (10 in number) and non-malaria patients (31 in number) by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). An immunoreactive band was observed at 43 kDa in CSF samples of cerebral malaria patients but not in non-malaria cases when tested with rabbit anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibodies by Western blot analysis. Eleven reactive monoclonal antibodies against P. falciparum were stabilized and expanded. Nine monoclonal antibodies were reactive to CSF samples of cerebral malaria and non-malaria and P. falciparum antigen by dot-ELISA and a common immunoreactive band at 43 kDa by Western blot. One clone Cl-2 was reactive at 43 kDa with CSF of the cerebral malaria patients and also in P. falciparum antigen but at 66 kDa with non-malarial CSF samples in Western blot. The other two clones (Cl-6 and 14) reacted with 3/31 (90% specific) and 8/31 (74%) CSF samples of non-malaria patients, respectively. The monoclonal antibody based ELISA reported in the present study using clone-6 can therefore offer another possibility for developing rapid, easy-to-perform, low-cost tests for diagnosis of cerebral malaria in CSF samples. Western blot using clone-2 might be useful for the detection of cerebral malaria antigen in CSF."

There was no association between hemoglobin levels (<10g/dl and > or = 10g/dl) and malaria, and although there was a good statistical association between temperature and malaria the specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive values were all low, indicating that temperature alone is a poor indicator of the disease. Based on the microscopy results, we found that a presumptive clinical diagnosis dramatically over-diagnosed malaria, and similarly there were a large number of false positives using the ParaSight-F test. We believe that many of the patients had received some form of malaria treatment prior to presentation at the hospital, and that the high number of false positives are explained by persistent antigenemia and the possibility of there being sequestered parasites following incomplete chemotherapy."

Benefits and limits for microscopic observation of Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites and gametocytes].,"The micro-wave oven permits a rapid drying of thick blood smears classically used for parasitological malaria diagnosis. In order to evaluate this type of drying on the microscopic reading, a study was carried out in an hyperendemic area of malaria with 382 asymptomatic volunteers of all ages. Two thick smears were made for each volunteer, one immediately dried with a micro-wave oven for one minute, the second dried in the open air without any intervention. A single microscopist examined all the thick smears. The observation of Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites differed significantly between the two methods, the prevalence was 50% by normal drying versus 41% by the micro-wave oven. The geometric mean of the trophozoite number for positive thick smears was significantly lower with the micro-wave oven. When the parasitological density with normal drying was lower than 200 trophozoites/microliter of blood, 54% of results were wrongly negative with the micro-wave oven. On the other hand, the observation of P. falciparum gametocytes was significantly facilitated after drying with the micro-wave oven; the prevalence was 8% with normal drying versus 12% by micro-wave oven. In conclusion, the use of the micro-wave oven for the drying of thick smears is not recommended for malaria diagnosis although it improves the observation and counting of P. falciparum gametocytes."

The QBC technique developed for diagnosis of malaria has been successfully used for detection of trypanosoma in blood. The purpose of this laboratory study was to evaluate the end-point sensitivity of the QBC test in comparison with the Woo test. Decreasing concentrations from 15 x 10(5) to 15 trypanosomes/ml of human blood were tested using the two techniques. Sensitivity was calculated in function of reading time at each concentration. Results showed that the sensitivity of the QBC test was 95% down to a concentration of 450 trypanosomes/ml. In comparison 95% sensitivity of the Woo test was observed only down to 7500 trypanosomes/ml and reading time was twofold longer. These findings were reproducible for two hours after sample preparation but deterioration was rapid thereafter. Given its simplicity and sensitivity, QBC test would appear to be a suitable technique for in-field screening programs for human African trypanosomiasis."

DNA was extracted with three different methods from parasite lysate by phenol-chloroform, or from whole blood and from blood collected onto dry filter paper, by chelex-100. The expected 727-bp PCR product was obtained in all samples extracted by chelex-100, while three samples prepared by phenol-chloroform failed to show any amplified product. The crucial point mutation within the dhfr gene leading to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil resistance is localised in an Alul recognition site. Thus, the 727-bp PCR product was submitted to endonuclease digestion. Fifty out of the 56 blood samples analysed yielded the two expected restriction fragments and an undigested 727-bp band. These 50 samples likely represent mixed infection as also confirmed the specific mutation PCR. The six undigested samples amplify a 339-bp fragment using a nested PCR-specific for pyrimethamine resistance mutation. Our results show that, the rapid DNA extraction from blood using chelex-100 and the PCR endonuclease assay can be efficiently used for accurate chemosensitivity analysis in the field."

Diagnosis based on clinical symptoms is decidedly unreliable, especially in areas of seasonal transmission like Zimbabwe. In view of this, the Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein (HRP-II) antigen detection assay (ParaSight-F test) was tried at 10 health centres in 3 malaria endemicity zones of Zimbabwe, as a malaria diagnostic tool for primary health care. Parasitological evaluations were conducted using thick and thin film microscopy as gold standard, and ease of test operation and practicability to nurses were ascertained by questionnaire. The sensitivity of the test did not vary substantially by endemicity zone and was approximately 93%. Specificities were 85, 72 and 92% in the hyperendemic, mesoendemic and hypoendemic zones, respectively. Positive predictive values varied considerably with endemicity, the lowest being in the hypoendemic zone (56%). However, negative predictive values did not change significantly, with a mean of 94%. It was found that the ParaSight-F test reduced mistreatment for malaria, relative to clinical diagnosis, by up to 81%, especially in the hypoendemic region. Test acceptability evaluations were good."

CD011431,0,19091039,0,Working without a blindfold: the critical role of diagnostics in malaria control.,"Diagnostic testing for malaria has for many years been eschewed, lest it be an obstacle to the delivery of rapid, life-saving treatment. The approach of treating malaria without confirmatory testing has been reinforced by the availability of inexpensive treatment with few side effects, by the great difficulty of establishing quality-assured microscopy in rural and resource-poor settings, and by the preeminence of malaria as a cause of important fever in endemic regions. Within the last decade, all three of these factors have changed. More expensive artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) has been widely introduced, simple immunochromatographic tests for malaria have been developed that can be used as an alternative to microscopy by village health workers, and recognition of the health cost of mismanaging non-malarial fever is growing. In most of the world a small fraction of fever is due to malaria, and reflex treatment with ACT does not make medical or economic sense. Global malaria control efforts have been energized by the availability of new sources of funding, and by the rapid reduction in malaria prevalence in a number of settings where bed nets, indoor residual spraying with insecticides, and ACT have been systematically deployed. This momentum has been captured by a new call for malaria elimination. Without wide implementation of accurate and discriminating diagnostic testing, and reporting of results, most fever will be inappropriately managed, millions of doses of ACT will be wasted, and malaria control programmes will be blindfolded to the impact of their efforts."
CD011431,0,15117307,0,Rapid epidemiologic assessment of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in malaria-endemic areas in Southeast Asia using a novel diagnostic kit.,"We recently reported a new rapid screening method for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This method incorporates a new formazan substrate (WST-8) and is capable of detecting heterozygous females both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here, we report its evaluation during field surveys at three malaria centres and in malaria-endemic villages of Myanmar and Indonesia, either alone or in combination with a rapid on-site diagnosis of malaria. A total of 57 severe (45 males and 12 females) and 34 mild (five males and 29 females) cases of G6PD deficiency were detected among 855 subjects in Myanmar whilst 30 severe (25 males and five females) and 23 mild (six males and 17 females) cases were found among 1286 subjects in Indonesia. In all cases, severe deficiency was confirmed with another formazan method but due to limitations in its detection threshold, mild cases were misdiagnosed as G6PD-normal by this latter method. Our results indicate that the novel method can qualitatively detect both severely deficient subjects as well as heterozygous females in the field. The antimalarial drug, primaquine, was safely prescribed to Plasmodium vivax-infected patients in Myanmar. Our new, rapid screening method may be essential for the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency particularly in rural areas without electricity, and can be recommended for use in malaria control programmes."

CD011431,0,19595360,0,Fever in returned travellers presenting in the United Kingdom: recommendations for investigation and initial management.,"International travel is increasing. Most physicians and general practitioners will encounter returned travellers with fever and the majority of travel-related infection is associated with travel to the tropics. In those returning from the tropics malaria must always be excluded, and HIV considered, from all settings. Common causes of non-malarial fever include from Africa rickettsial diseases, amoebic liver abscess and Katayama syndrome; from South and South East Asia, enteric fever and arboviral infection; from the Middle East, brucellosis and from the Horn of Africa visceral leishmaniasis. Other rare but important diseases from particular geographical areas include leptospirosis, trypanosomiasis and viral haemorrhagic fever. North and South America, Europe and Australia also have infections which are geographically concentrated. Empirical treatment may have to be started based on epidemiological probability of infection whilst waiting for results to return. The evidence base for much of the management of tropical infections is limited. These recommendations provide a pragmatic approach to the initial diagnosis and management of fever in returned travellers, based on evidence where it is available and on consensus of expert opinion where it is not. With early diagnosis and treatment the majority of patients with a potentially fatal infection related to travel will make a rapid and full recovery."
CD011431,0,16014858,1,False-positive results of a Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2-detecting malaria rapid diagnostic test due to high sensitivity in a community with fluctuating low parasite density.,"The persistence of parasite histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) in the circulation after parasite clearance has been considered a drawback for rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) targeting HRP2 and a major cause of false-positive results. This paper reports results of a study into whether a proportion of RDT HRP2 false-positive cases carried parasites using polymerase chain reaction analysis as the gold standard rather than microscopy. The high rate of RDT false-positive parasitemia results in comparison with microscopy was shown to predominantly represent cases that had a parasite density below the threshold for detection by microscopy. Despite the generally low disease-endemic prevalence of malaria in the area, there was a high prevalence of chronic infections with low, fluctuating, parasite densities that were better detected by RDT. Our results suggest that in areas known to have low-density parasitemias, RDTs targeting HRP2 may increase diagnostic sensitivity in comparison with microscopy. While microscopy remains the standard for comparison of malaria diagnostic accuracy, the limitations of microscopy, and the possibility that RDTs may have superior accuracy in some circumstances, should be taken into account when interpreting results of diagnostic trials."
CD011431,0,14573641,0,Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum rifin proteins are associated with rapid parasite clearance and asymptomatic infections.,"Plasmodium falciparum rifin proteins, belonging to the largest known family of variable infected-erythrocyte surface-expressed proteins encoded by rif genes, were recently shown to be capable of inducing a strong immune response in P. falciparum-infected adults living in an area in Gabon where malaria is endemic. In the present study, the levels of antirifin antibodies were analyzed in serum obtained from 60 children from the same area who were admitted to hospital and diagnosed with severe malaria. High antirifin antibody concentrations in these individuals correlated significantly with their capacity to rapidly clear their parasites from the circulation after the start of chemotherapy. A doubling of antirifin antibody concentrations reduced the clearance time by 5 h (95% confidence interval, 4.1 to 6.9 h). In the same group of children, who were followed up for 2 years, antirifin antibody levels did not correlate with a reduced rate of reinfection or with a delay in the time to the first reinfection. However, the initial antirifin antibody levels were sustained over the study period. The likelihood that these antibodies could confer a certain degree of protection against malaria is supported by our findings of statistically higher levels of antirifin antibodies to all four rifin proteins in a group of 42 asymptomatic parasitemic children."

CD011431,0,21398075,0,Validation of PCR for detection and characterization of parasitaemia in massive splenomegaly attributed clinically to malaria infection.,"In this study, 101 patients with massive splenomegaly (MS) and 41 with moderate splenomegaly (MoS) from Kassala, Eastern Sudan, were included. The patients were recruited during a peak and the end of a malaria season and during a dry season between 2007 and 2008. Based on clinical findings and exclusion of other causes of MS, the former patients were presumed to be infected with malaria parasite; thus, the condition was termed as massive malarial splenomegaly (MMS). Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used for malaria parasite detection. In the MMS group, the parasite rate was 50% and 49% as estimated by microscopy and RDT, respectively. However, the PCR showed higher parasite rate (79.3%, P = 0.000), Plasmodium vivax infection, and mixed infections. The PCR-corrected parasite rate in the MoS and control groups was 73.2% and 3.5%, respectively. The parasite rate as estimated by microscopy was highest at the end of the malaria season and lowest in the dry season; however, the parasite rate estimated by PCR was stable in all study periods. There was significant reduction in spleen size following anti-malaria treatment. In conclusion, the use of PCR had revealed significantly higher parasite rate, P. vivax, and mixed infections in MMS as compared to microscopy, while the RDT was found to be comparable to microscopy and is suggested to complement the use of the latter. The study also disclosed a seasonal variation of patent parasitemia with an overall low parasite count and scarce gametocytaemia in MMS."
CD011431,0,10991837,0,Hematin polymerization assay as a high-throughput screen for identification of new antimalarial pharmacophores.,"Hematin polymerization is a parasite-specific process that enables the detoxification of heme following its release in the lysosomal digestive vacuole during hemoglobin degradation, and represents both an essential and a unique pharmacological drug target. We have developed a high-throughput in vitro microassay of hematin polymerization based on the detection of (14)C-labeled hematin incorporated into polymeric hemozoin (malaria pigment). The assay uses 96-well filtration microplates and requires 12 h and a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta liquid scintillation counter. The robustness of the assay allowed the rapid screening and evaluation of more than 100, 000 compounds. Random screening was complemented by the development of a pharmacophore hypothesis using the ""Catalyst"" program and a large amount of data available on the inhibitory activity of a large library of 4-aminoquinolines. Using these methods, we identified ""hit"" compounds belonging to several chemical structural classes that had potential antimalarial activity. Follow-up evaluation of the antimalarial activity of these compounds in culture and in the Plasmodium berghei murine model further identified compounds with actual antimalarial activity. Of particular interest was a triarylcarbinol (Ro 06-9075) and a related benzophenone (Ro 22-8014) that showed oral activity in the murine model. These compounds are chemically accessible and could form the basis of a new antimalarial medicinal chemistry program."

CD011431,0,11728042,1,Evaluation of a dipstick test for the rapid diagnosis of imported malaria among patients presenting within the network TropNetEurop.,"Lack of experience on the part of involved laboratory personnel frequently complicates swift diagnosis of imported falciparum malaria in non-endemic areas. Diagnostic tools based on the dipstick principle for the detection of plasmodial histidine-rich protein 2 have been marketed for several years and have been extensively evaluated. Recently, a test kit capable of detecting antigen of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax has been introduced. In order to evaluate this newly available tool, specimens from 664 patients were screened during the course of a prospective multicentre study within the European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance (TropNetEurop). Among the screened specimens, samples from 82 patients (12.3%) were positive for falciparum malaria using expert microscopy. A further 17 samples were positive for vivax malaria. The evaluated test kit performed with a sensitivity of 87.8% and a specificity of 99% for detection of falciparum malaria. Respective values for vivax malaria were 76.5% and 100%. Dipstick tests have the potential of improving the speed and accuracy of the diagnosis of falciparum malaria, especially if non-specialized laboratories are involved. However, decreased values of sensitivity and specificity, in comparison with expert microscopy, still impose a clear limit on the usefulness of the currently available kits."
CD011431,0,18807374,0,Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in malaria.,"Malaria is an important treatable cause of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the tropics and in the returning traveller in the non-endemic areas. ARDS is an important complication in severe, complicated falciparum malaria and has been described in P. vivax and P. ovale malaria also. Malarial ALI/ARDS is more common in adults than in children. Pregnant women and non-immune individuals are more prone to develop this condition. Increased alveolar capillary permeability resulting in intravascular fluid loss into the lungs appears to be the key pathophysiologic mechanism. In malaria, ARDS can develop either at initial presentation or after initiation of treatment when the parasitaemia is falling and the patient is improving. Patients present with acute onset dysnoea that can rapidly progress to respiratory failure. The diagnosis of malaria is confirmed by slide microscopy supported by the use of rapid antigen tests. Patients with malarial ARDS should be managed in an intensive care unit. Careful attention must be paid to haemodynamic stabilisation and optimising fluid balance. Currently, specific treatment choices for malaria include parenteral artemisinins or intravenous quinine along with doxycycline. Respiratory failure requires endotracheal intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation. Co-existent bacterial sepsis is frequently present in patients with malarial ARDS eventhough an obvious focus may not be evident. Appropriate broad spectrum antibiotic therapy must be started when there is a clinical suspicion after procuring the microbiological specimens. ARDS in malaria is a disease with a high mortality. Early diagnosis, institution of specific antimalarial treatment and assisted ventilation can be life-saving."

CD011431,0,19530624,0,Diagnosis of clinical samples spotted on FTA cards using PCR-based methods.,"The broad clinical presentation of Leishmaniasis makes the diagnosis of current and past cases of this disease rather difficult. Differential diagnosis is important because diseases caused by other aetiologies and a clinical spectrum similar to that of leishmaniasis (e.g. leprosy, skin cancers and tuberculosis for CL; malaria and schistosomiasis for VL) are often present in endemic areas of endemicity. Presently, a variety of methods have been developed and tested to aid the identification and diagnosis of Leishmania. The advent of the PCR technology has opened new channels for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis in a variety of clinical materials. PCR is a simple, rapid procedure that has been adapted for diagnosis of leishmaniasis. A range of tools is currently available for the diagnosis and identification of leishmaniasis and Leishmania species, respectively. However, none of these diagnostic tools are examined and tested using samples spotted on FTA cards. Three different PCR-based approaches were examined including: kDNA minicircle, Leishmania 18S rRNA gene and PCR-RFLP of Intergenic region of ribosomal protein. PCR primers were designed that sit within the coding sequences of genes (relatively well conserved) but which amplify across the intervening intergenic sequence (relatively variable). These were used in PCR-RFLP on reference isolates of 10 of the most important Leishmania species: L. donovani, L. infantum, L. major & L. tropica. Digestion of PCR products with restriction enzymes produced species-specific restriction patterns allowed discrimination of reference isolates. The kDNA minicircle primers are highly sensitive in diagnosis of both bone marrow and skin smears from FTA cards. Leishmania 18S rRNA gene conserved region is sensitive in identification of bone marrow smear but less sensitive in diagnosing skin smears. The intergenic nested PCR-RFLP using P5 & P6 as well as P1 & P2 newly designed primers showed high level of reproducibility and sensitivity. Though, it was less sensitive than kDNA minicircle primers, but easily discriminated between Leishmania species."
CD011431,0,18786847,0,False-positive results of a rapid K39-based strip test and Chagas disease.,"The definitive diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) requires invasive procedures with demonstration of amastigotes in tissue or promastigotes in culture. Unfortunately, these approaches require laboratory materials not available in poor countries where the disease is endemic. The correct diagnosis of VL is important, and made more difficult by the fact that several common tropical diseases such as malaria, disseminated tuberculosis, and enteric fever share the same clinical presentation. Serological tests have been developed to replace parasitological diagnosis in the field. A commercially available K39-based strip test for VL has been developed for this purpose. The endemic area of leishmaniasis in Brazil overlaps the endemic area of Chagas disease, a disease that can cause false-positive serological test results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of false-positive exams using a rapid test for VL in patients with Chagas disease."

Rapid malaria antigen tests may improve the diagnosis of malaria in the rural tropics. After 1 h training 64 village health volunteers (VHVs) from rural Laos, with no previous laboratory experience, performed two malaria rapid diagnostic tests (ParacheckPf and OptiMAL) accurately. The reliability of six VHVs was assessed longitudinally, over 10 months with different frequencies of retraining. Compared with microscopy, error rates in dipstick interpretation were low (<2%) for both tests and were not associated with retraining frequency (P>0.2). Previously untrained Lao VHVs performed malaria rapid tests reliably with high sensitivity and specificity after minimal training."

The mean annual case rate of malaria in this study group was more than three times the national rate. This may be ascribed to the notable ethnic diversity of the population. A history of travel to an area endemic for malaria was eventually elicited from all patients. The most common chief complaint was fever (56%) followed by abdominal pain (12%). Temperatures were elevated in 70% of the patients, with a mean temperature of 102.9 degrees F (39 degrees C). Gender was found to play a role in delaying diagnosis, with women accounting for 83% of a group of patients requiring multiple ED visits before diagnosis. The authors conclude that malaria must be considered when diagnosing patients in ethnically diverse populations. Gender may be associated with a delay in diagnosis. A careful travel history and a peripheral smear are aids in rapid diagnosis."

But it needs skilled microscopist as well as good laboratory set up, which are scarce in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in Bangladesh. A study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a newly introduced Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) device based on immunochromatographic test (ICT) format, for malarial parasite. This study was carried out at Balipara, a remote village 64 km away from Bandarban Hill District headquarters, during January 2007 to September 2007. A total 271 patients who reported to Sickbay of 37 Rifle Battalion, Balipara were tested by MALARIAGEN MALARIA Pf/Pv Antigen Rapid Test kit on the spot. Thick & thin blood films were prepared and stained by laboratory technician at the sick bay, properly labeled, preserved and sent to pathologist working at Armed Forces Medical College, Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka for microscopy. Three (1.11%) cases were excluded as control band of RDT were negative or test band appeared after long incubation. Six (2.22%) were excluded for poor quality of staining blood film. Among 262 cases malarial parasites were detected in 74(28.24%). Of these 62(83.78%) were Plasmodium falciparum and 12(16.22%) were Plasmodium vivax. Parasite count ranged from 2500/mµL to 527500/mµL with mean 67400/mµL (+/-93400). Among 262 cases, 97(37.02%) were positive for malarial antigen(s) in RDT. Of these 74(76.29%) were P. falciparum and 23(23.71%) were P. vivax. Overall sensitivity and specificity of RDT for detection of malarial antigen(s) irrespective of their species were 95.95% and 86.71% respectively with positive and negative predictive value 73% & 98% respectively. Relative to microscopy, the device has shown sensitivity 94.6% and specificity 88.52% for detection of P. falciparum with positive and negative predictive value 72% and 98% respectively. The device sensitivity and specificity for detection of P. vivax were 100% and 93.1% with respective positive and negative predictive value 47% and 100%.

CD011431,0,8488374,0,[Emergency blood picture].,"Assessment of peripheral blood counts and blood film analysis are frequently performed as diagnostic procedures in emergency medicine. Far fewer situations exist, however, in which these analyses are the main clue in establishing an emergency diagnosis. Artifacts can lead to wrong diagnosis, e.g. pseudo-thrombocytopenia, which is defined as a low platelet count resulting from a laboratory artifact. Severe neutropenia (agranulocytosis) and extreme hyperleukocytosis, as well as suspicion of acute leukemia, require a rapid diagnostic work-up. A newly detected anemia should not necessarily be treated by packed red cell transfusions. The decision whether an anemic patient ought to receive transfusions should be based on the speed with which the anemia has developed, as well as on clinical judgement. As a rule a chronic anemia patient with hemoglobin above 70 g/l does not need transfusions. An uncritical transfusion policy can even cause emergencies, e.g. in patients with megaloblastic anemia or in anemic multiple myeloma patients with a hyperviscosity syndrome. An elevated hematocrit requires prompt further investigations. This is of utmost importance if one considers the diagnosis of polycythemia vera rubra, a disease in which patients are particularly prone to thrombotic complications. Fragmented red cells (schistocytes) on peripheral blood smears constitute a cardinal diagnostic clue for the detection of microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (MAHA), in particular for the diagnosis of the life-threatening thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Malaria is another example for a chief role of blood smears examination in achieving a rapid diagnosis. If one encounters an unexpected severe thrombocytopenia, a marrow examination reveals whether it is due to rapid peripheral destruction, or due to a marrow failure. Furthermore, in any patients with an unanticipated thrombocytopenia, a disseminated intravascular coagulation and a MAHA should be ruled out. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare, but possibly fatal complication of therapy with heparins."

CD011431,0,9063360,1,Parasight F test compared with the polymerase chain reaction and microscopy for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in travelers.,"Imported malaria is an increasing problem worldwide. A rapid and accurate test for Plasmodium falciparum infection would facilitate the diagnosis of malaria in the returned traveler. The ParaSight F antigen capture assay (dipstick test) is a new diagnostic test for P. falciparum based on detection of circulating histidine-rich protein-2 antigen. We performed a blinded evaluation of this assay compared with microscopy and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of P. falciparum infection in 151 febrile travelers. Compared with the PCR, the dipstick test had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 97%. The ability of the dipstick test to detect P. falciparum was similar with that of microscopy (88% versus 83%) since the species of Plasmodium in 14 of 133 malaria-infected patients could not be determined by microscopy due to low parasite numbers. The dipstick test was 40% sensitive for infections with < 50 parasites/microliter, 89% with 50-100 parasites/microliter, and > or = 93% with > 100 parasites/microliter. Circulating antigen was detectable in 68% of the patients seven days after initiation of treatment and in 27% at day 28. The dipstick test represents a simple and accurate test for the diagnosis of P. falciparum infection in the returned traveler."
CD011431,0,22259210,0,Identification of optimal epitopes for Plasmodium falciparum rapid diagnostic tests that target histidine-rich proteins 2 and 3.,"Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) represent important tools to diagnose malaria infection. To improve understanding of the variable performance of RDTs that detect the major target in Plasmodium falciparum, namely, histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), and to inform the design of better tests, we undertook detailed mapping of the epitopes recognized by eight HRP-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). To investigate the geographic skewing of this polymorphic protein, we analyzed the distribution of these epitopes in parasites from geographically diverse areas. To identify an ideal amino acid motif for a MAb to target in HRP2 and in the related protein HRP3, we used a purpose-designed script to perform bioinformatic analysis of 448 distinct gene sequences from pfhrp2 and from 99 sequences from the closely related gene pfhrp3. The frequency and distribution of these motifs were also compared to the MAb epitopes. Heat stability testing of MAbs immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes was also performed. Results of these experiments enabled the identification of MAbs with the most desirable characteristics for inclusion in RDTs, including copy number and coverage of target epitopes, geographic skewing, heat stability, and match with the most abundant amino acid motifs identified. This study therefore informs the selection of MAbs to include in malaria RDTs as well as in the generation of improved MAbs that should improve the performance of HRP-detecting malaria RDTs."

CD011431,0,20421630,0,Plasmodium falciparum malaria detected by HRP-2 antigenemia before microscopic- and PCR-positive conversion.,"We describe a case of relapsed Plasmodium falciparum malaria detected by rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) 19 days before microscopic- or PCR-positive conversion. Three malaria tests gave discrepant results; the malaria smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were both negative, while malaria RDT with a commercial kit to detect malarial antigens, including histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2), was repeatedly positive for P. falciparum. About 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, the patient was hospitalized because of a high fever. Blood and urine cultures and malaria smears were all negative, and a subsequent bone marrow study was performed to evaluate fever of unknown origin. Unexpectedly, 19 days after the positive RDT result, malaria parasites were detected by microscopy in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. The malaria PCR result also became positive for P. falciparum on the same day. This case report shows that a positive RDT result discordant with microscopy and PCR should not be viewed as a failure of RDT, but must be evaluated carefully to rule out infection at a low parasite density. In such unusual cases, frequent follow-up tests with multiple methods are recommended for an accurate diagnosis. The RDT may achieve earlier detection than methods targeting parasitemia in some patients with malaria."

This is primarily useful for epidemiological investigations of malaria because the infections, often with two or more Plasmodium species present simultaneously, are frequently associated with microscopically sub-patent parasite levels and cryptic mixed infections. Numerous distinct equally adequate amplification-based protocols have been described, but it is unclear which to select for epidemiological surveys. Few comparative studies are available, and none that addresses the issue of inter-laboratory variability."

CD011431,0,19995437,0,Hidden burden of malaria in Indian women.,"Malaria is endemic in India with an estimated 70-100 million cases each year (1.6-1.8 million reported by NVBDCP); of this 50-55% are Plasmodium vivax and 45-50% Plasmodium falciparum. A recent study on malaria in pregnancy reported from undivided Madhya Pradesh state (includes Chhattisgarh state), that an estimated over 220,000 pregnant women contract malaria infection each year. Malaria in pregnancy caused- abortions 34.5%; stillbirths 9%; and maternal deaths 0.45%. Bulk of this tragic outcome can be averted by following the Roll Back Malaria/WHO recommendations of the use of malaria prevention i.e. indoor residual spraying (IRS)/insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) preferably long-lasting treated bed nets (LLIN); intermittent preventive therapy (IPT); early diagnosis, prompt and complete treatment using microscopic/malaria rapid diagnostics test (RDT) and case management. High incidence in pregnancy has arisen because of malaria surveillance lacking coverage, lack of age and sex wise data, staff shortages, and intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) applicable in high transmission states/pockets is not included in the national drug policy- an essential component of fighting malaria in pregnancy in African settings. Inadequate surveillance and gross under-reporting has been highlighted time and again for over three decades. As a result the huge problem of malaria in pregnancy reported occasionally by researchers has remained hidden. Malaria in pregnancy may quicken severity in patients with drug resistant parasites, anaemia, endemic poverty, and malnutrition. There is, therefore, urgent need to streamline malaria control strategies to make a difference in tackling this grim scenario in human health."

In this study, we evaluated the performance of one such device, the Makromed dipstick test, blindly compared to PCR and microscopy for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 200 febrile returned travelers. The Makromed assay detects the presence of P. falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein II with an antigen capture immunochromatographic strip format. Compared to PCR as the reference standard, the dipstick assay had a sensitivity of 97.0% and a specificity of 96.0%. The positive and negative predictive values were 81.2% and 99.5%, respectively.

CD011431,0,18541764,1,Modeling the financial and clinical implications of malaria rapid diagnostic tests in the case-management of older children and adults in Kenya.,"Using data on clinical practices for outpatients 5 years and older, test accuracy, and malaria prevalence, we model financial and clinical implications of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) under the new artemether-lumefantrine (AL) treatment policy in one high and one low malaria prevalence district in Kenya. In the high transmission district, RDTs as actually used would improve malaria treatment (61% less over-treatment but 8% more under-treatment) and lower costs (21% less). Nonetheless, the majority of patients with malaria would not be correctly treated with AL. In the low transmission district, especially because the treatment policy was new and AL was not widely used, RDTs as actually used would yield a minor reduction in under-treatment errors (36% less but the base is small) with 41% higher costs. In both districts, adherence to revised clinical practices with RDTs has the potential to further decrease treatment errors with acceptable costs."
CD011431,0,16715782,0,Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics findings after repeated administration of ARTESUNATE thermostable suppositories (RECTOCAPS) in Vietnamese patients with uncomplicated malaria.,"In recent years, Artemisinin and particularly one of its derivatives--Artesunate (ART--has become an essential alternative for treatment of both uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria in Asia and Africa as well. Therefore, these compounds are still and inccreasingly in the focus of interest because of quick acting of this drug, is able to help even unconscious to overcome the malaria attack, when administered by injection. As an alternative, RECTOCAPS have been developed and their use is meanwhile well established. From earlier studies in children, suffering from plasmodium falciparum malaria, we obtained a high level of DHART in the blood, but as expected also a rapid decline in the levels of both DHART and ART. A second administration of ART was additionally applied 4 hours after the first administration. DHART and ART plasma levels were found to last longer on an assumed therapeutic level than those obtained after one administration only. The fever clearance and the parasitemia reduction rates were found to be effective according to this dosing regimen. In view of these findings, we decided to conduct the actual described study by administering 200 mg of ART every 3 hours (0, 3, 6 and 9 h) by the rectal route. Soft geiatine capsules (RECTOCAPS) containing 200 mg of ART GMP--type each (Artesunic acid) were administered by rectal route. Each patient received four RECTOCAPS capsules (4 x 200 mg of ART) over a 3 h period. 12 adult patients with uncomplicated malaria were selected. Age, weight, height, body temperature, parasite counts before treatment and their evolution until 96 h are determined. Blood samples were taken at short time intervals after starting with the first medication: 0, 30 min, 60 min, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 60 h, 72 h, 84 h, 96 h and 108 h. The aliquots of all the blood samples were used for performing parasite counts. Plasma obtained following the traditional procedure was kept at -40 degrees C until analysis. HPLC technique with electrochemical detector was used for quantification of ART and DHART. From the blood concentration values of ART and DHART, the following observation can be derived: the onset of action is observed within the first half hours, therapeutic levels of the drug obtained (89 microg/ml ART compared to 84 microg/ml DHART). The DHART levels are somewhat higher than those of ART (a peak concentration after 6 h starting medication of 151 microg/ml ART as compared to 276 microg/ml DHART). The variations as a function of frequency of DHART uptake are much less marked than those observed for ART. Another finding is that after the administration, some sort of a plateau of DHART and ART is built up, lasting at least from 9 to 12 hours with DHART level of about 190 microg/ml and ART of 90 microg/ml. In the case of single-dose administration, the levels of both compounds were below the detection threshold after three hours. With regard to the parasite counts, although there were inter-individual variations, it should be noted that after 48 hours a high proportion of the patients (8 out of 12) was completely clear of parasites. Similar results were observed with regard to the body temperature (7 out of 12 returned to normal temperature 36 hours after starting the therapy). The findings of the study support the RECTOCAPS application principle resulting in effectiveness both for the velocity of drug uptake as well as for the height of plasma levels. Repeated administration of ART can extend the duration of therapeutic plasma levels of the drug."

The materials were selected, based on published data and on our preliminary findings. Initially screening tests were performed using crude antigens such as Purified Protein Derivate (PPD) and a BCG-filtrate. Unfortunately, the results with these antigens were not promising. The specificity of both antigens using sera from 94 healthy controls was 64%. As a consequence of these findings, the crude antigens were excluded from further tests, and the study was continued with purified antigens. The work focused on 2 purified proteins: Antigen 60 (A60), a lipopolysaccharide-protein complex, and P32, a stress protein produced in zinc deprived cultures, identified as Antigen 85 A in the BCG reference system, both isolated from Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The commercial A60 based ELISA and our own P32 based ELISA were used to test a total of 300 sera from HIV positive, negative and unscreened individuals, mainly originating from Burundi. These sera were collected from clinical established cases of pulmonary TB, extrapulmonary TB, and patients with non-tuberculous tropical diseases such as salmonellosis, trypanosomiasis, malaria, etc. and healthy individuals. The A60 based ELISA had a sensitivity of 76.8% for the proven cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis and 61.9% for the extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases. No difference was shown between HIV positive and HIV negative patients. Specificity reached 95.2% for healthy individuals, but dropped to 68.1% when persons with active non-tuberculous tropical diseases were included. Eighty-six percent of the pulmonary cases and 87.7% of the extrapulmonary cases were detected by the ELISA-P32. These findings suggest that this test might be useful as a confirmatory test for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Again no difference was noticed between HIV negative and positive patients. The main contraindication for the use of the ELISA-P32 for the diagnosis of tuberculosis is its low specificity: 70.2% with sera from healthy controls and 22.2% for hospitalised patients and persons with non-tuberculous tropical diseases. In a small recent prospective study 4 out of 10 HIV+ persons with no evidence for TB yielded a positive result for the ELISA-P32. Two of them developed pulmonary tuberculosis within 6 months, whereas 2 P32-positives and 6 P32-negatives remained up to now without any manifestations of tuberculosis. The difference was not significant, but the number of cases was limited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD011431,0,22764292,0,Community health workers use malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) safely and accurately: results of a longitudinal study in Zambia.,"Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) could radically improve febrile illness management in remote and low-resource populations. However, reliance upon community health workers (CHWs) remains controversial because of concerns about blood safety and appropriate use of artemisinin combination therapy. This study assessed CHW ability to use RDTs safely and accurately up to 12 months post-training. We trained 65 Zambian CHWs, and then provided RDTs, job-aids, and other necessary supplies for village use. Observers assessed CHW performance at 3, 6, and 12 months post-training. Critical steps performed correctly increased from 87.5% at 3 months to 100% subsequently. However, a few CHWs incorrectly read faint positive or invalid results as negative. Although most indicators improved or remained stable over time, interpretation of faint positives fell to 76.7% correct at 12 months. We conclude that appropriately trained and supervised CHWs can use RDTs safely and accurately in community practice for up to 12 months post-training."

CD011431,0,11517439,0,Chloroquine-resistant malaria.,"The development of chloroquine as an antimalarial drug and the subsequent evolution of drug-resistant Plasmodium strains had major impacts on global public health in the 20th century. In P. falciparum, the cause of the most lethal human malaria, chloroquine resistance is linked to multiple mutations in PfCRT, a protein that likely functions as a transporter in the parasite's digestive vacuole membrane. Rapid diagnostic assays for PfCRT mutations are already employed as surveillance tools for drug resistance. Here, we review recent field studies that support the central role of PfCRT mutations in chloroquine resistance. These studies suggest chloroquine resistance arose in > or = 4 distinct geographic foci and substantiate an important role of immunity in the outcomes of resistant infections after chloroquine treatment. P. vivax, which also causes human malaria, appears to differ from P. falciparum in its mechanism of chloroquine resistance. Investigation of the resistance mechanisms and of the role of immunity in therapeutic outcomes will support new approaches to drugs that can take the place of chloroquine or augment its efficiency."
CD011431,0,17215045,0,UK malaria treatment guidelines.,"Malaria is the tropical disease most commonly imported into the UK, with 1500-2000 cases reported each year, and 10-20 deaths. Approximately three-quarters of reported malaria cases in the UK are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which is capable of invading a high proportion of red blood cells and rapidly leading to severe or life-threatening multi-organ disease. Most non-falciparum malaria cases are caused by Plasmodium vivax; a few cases are caused by the other two species of Plasmodium: Plasmodium ovale or Plasmodium malariae. Mixed infections with more than 1 species of parasite can occur; they commonly involve P. falciparum with the attendant risks of severe malaria. Management of malaria depends on awareness of the diagnosis and on performing the correct diagnostic tests: the diagnosis cannot be excluded until 3 blood specimens have been examined by an experienced microscopist. There are no typical clinical features of malaria, even fever is not invariably present. The optimum diagnostic procedure is examination of thick and thin blood films by an expert to detect and speciate the malarial parasites; P. falciparum malaria can be diagnosed almost as accurately using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which detect plasmodial antigens or enzymes, although RDTs for other Plasmodium species are not as reliable. The treatment of choice for non-falciparum malaria is a 3-day course of oral chloroquine, to which only a limited proportion of P. vivax strains have gained resistance. Dormant parasites (hypnozoites) persist in the liver after treatment of P. vivax or P. ovale infection: the only currently effective drug for eradication of hypnozoites is primaquine. This must be avoided or given with caution under expert supervision in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), in whom it may cause severe haemolysis. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria can be treated orally with quinine, atovaquone plus proguanil (Malarone) or co-artemether (Riamet); quinine is highly effective but poorly tolerated in prolonged dosage and is always supplemented by additional treatment, usually with oral doxycycline. ALL patients treated for P. falciparum malaria should be admitted to hospital for at least 24 h, since patients can deteriorate suddenly, especially early in the course of treatment. Severe falciparum malaria, or infections complicated by a relatively high parasite count (more than 2% of red blood cells parasitized), should be treated with intravenous therapy until the patient is well enough to continue with oral treatment. In the UK, the treatment of choice for severe or complicated malaria is currently an infusion of intravenous quinine. This may exacerbate hypoglycaemia that can occur in malaria; patients treated with intravenous quinine therefore require careful monitoring. Intravenous artesunate reduces high parasite loads more rapidly than quinine and is more effective in treating severe malaria in selected situations. It can also be used in patients with contra-indications to quinine. Intravenous artesunate is unlicensed in the EU. Assistance in obtaining artesunate may be sought from specialist tropical medicine centres, on consultation, for named patients. Patients with severe or complicated malaria should be managed in a high dependency or intensive care environment. They may require haemodynamic support and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal impairment/failure, seizures, and severe intercurrent infections including gram-negative bacteraemia/septicaemia. Falciparum malaria in pregnancy is more likely to be severe and complicated: the placenta contains high levels of parasites. Stillbirth or early delivery may occur and diagnosis can be difficult if parasites are concentrated in the placenta and scanty in the blood. The treatment of choice for falciparum malaria in pregnancy is quinine; doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy but clindamycin can be substituted for it, and is equally effective. Primaquine (for eradication of P. vivax or P. ovale hypnozoites) is contraindicated in pregnancy; after treatment for these infections a pregnant woman should take weekly chloroquine prophylaxis until after delivery when hypnozoite eradication can be considered. Children are over-represented in the incidence of malaria in the UK, probably because completely susceptible UK-born children accompany their overseas-born parents on visits to family and friends in endemic areas. Malaria in children (and sometimes in adults) may present with misleading symptoms such as gastrointestinal features, sore throat or lower respiratory complaints; the diagnosis must always be sought in a feverish or very sick child who has visited malaria-endemic areas. Children can be treated with most of the antimalarial regimens which are effective in adults, with appropriate dosage adjustment. Doxycycline plus quinine should not be given to children under 12 years as doxycycline is contraindicated in this age group, but clindamycin can be substituted for doxycycline, and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (Fansidar) may also be an effective substitute. An acute attack of malaria does not confer protection from future attacks: individuals who have had malaria should take effective anti-mosquito precautions and chemoprophylaxis during future visits to endemic areas."

In vitro studies have shown high levels of resistance, therefore another antimalarial drug therapy will be introduced at the end of the year: first-line: artemether-lumefantrine, second-line: mefloquine or halofantrine, third-line: quinine. To conclude, solutions exist but a real policy from the decision makers is necessary to implement them. The eradication of malaria remains a dream, but we can expect ""zero death"" in Mayotte, considering that the fight against this disease may help to start a regional health program."
CD011431,0,14766829,1,Evaluation of the RealArt Malaria LC real-time PCR assay for malaria diagnosis.,"PCR-based methods have advantages over traditional microscopic methods for the diagnosis of malaria, especially in cases of low parasitemia and mixed infections. However, current PCR-based assays are often labor-intensive and not readily quantifiable and have the potential for contamination due to a requirement for postamplification sample handling. Real-time PCR can address these limitations. This study evaluated the performance characteristics of a commercial malaria real-time PCR assay (RealArt Malaria LC Assay; Artus GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) on the LightCycler platform for the detection of malaria parasites in 259 febrile returned travelers. Compared to nested PCR as the reference standard, the real-time assay had a sensitivity of 99.5%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 99.6% for the detection of malaria. Our results indicate that the RealArt assay is a rapid (<45 min), sensitive, and specific method for the detection of malaria in returned travelers."

This literature review summarizes available data on how biomarkers might be applied to diagnose, prognosticate and provide mechanistic insights in patients with severe malaria. Of the large number of candidate biomarkers, only PfHRP2 has consistently demonstrated clinical utility and, when incorporated into rapid antigen detection tests, has shown diagnostic sensitivity above 95%, which is at least as good as light microscopy. As a quantitative test, PfHRP2 also shows some promise in differentiating severe malarial from non-malarial disease in areas where asymptomatic carriage of malaria parasites is common, and possibly as a tool to estimate sequestered parasite burden and subsequent mortality. Biomarkers such as pLDH and panmalarial antigen have lower sensitivity for non-falciparum malaria in rapid antigen detection tests. There is an urgent need to discover and validate better biomarkers for incorporation into rapid antigen detection tests in countries where Plasmodium vivax is a common cause of severe disease. A large number of host-derived acute-phase reactants, markers of endothelial dysfunction and immune mediators have been proposed as biomarkers. Although they have provided mechanistic insights into the immunopathology of severe malaria, their roles as clinical tools remain uncertain."

It has been based on detection of circulating parasite lactate dehydrogenase enzyme (pLDH), produced by live Plasmodium parasites. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of the OptiMAL test with routine microscopic examination of Giemsa-Stained Thick Blood Film (routine GS-TBF) for the diagnosis of malaria at a local malaria clinic in a hyperendemic area of Thailand by using a standard GS-TBF (standard GS-TBF) as reference. One hundred and seventy five patients attending the clinic were recruited; 50, 42 and 83 were falciparum malaria, vivax malaria and non-malaria patients, respectively. Compared with the reference, the OptiMAL test had sensitivities of 92 per cent and 97.6 per cent, whereas, the routine GS-TBF had sensitivities of 81.3 per cent and 81 per cent for the detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. Both tests showed no false positive resulting in 100 per cent specificities. However, the OptiMAL test was able to detect only 20 per cent of infection with less than 200 parasitaemia/microlitre. It was also shown in our study that the OptiMAL test was advantageous in follow-up of the treatment outcome. No false positive occurred among 40 follow-up cases.

The ability of mothers to diagnose fever and anaemia in their young children has recently been explored, as part of a large, birth-cohort study in rural, north-western Burkina Faso. During a cross-sectional survey in six villages, 345 children aged, <3 years and their mothers were investigated. Each mother was asked if she considered her child to be febrile and/or anaemic before that child's temperature and haematocrit were measured, with an electronic thermometer and portable centrifuge, respectively. The recorded prevalences of fever (> or =37.5 degrees C) and anaemia (haematocrit, <25%) in the children were 12.2% and 21.4%, respectively. The mothers' diagnoses had a sensitivity of 76.2% [95% confidence interval (CI)=60.6%-88.0%] for fever and 4.1% (CI=0.8%-11.4%) for anaemia, with corresponding specificities of 87.1% (CI=82.8%-90.7%) and 95.9% (CI=92.9%-98.0%). Mothers in rural Africa appear to be fairly accurate in detecting fever in their children but less accurate in detecting anaemia. While malaria control needs to employ a mix of preventive and curative measures, anaemia control will benefit from community-based malaria-control measures as well as broader approaches addressing the nutritional status of young children."

Less than a year after the introduction of amodiaquine/sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ/SP) as first-line treatment in Senegal, we examined adherence rates to therapy and its efficacy among children. The study was conducted in five dispensaries in rural Senegal. Children aged 2-10 years with a presumptive diagnosis of malaria were prescribed AQ/SP. Thick blood film analyses were carried out on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28. Blood and urine samples were collected on day 3 for drug level measurements. The principal caregivers were questioned on treatment adherence. Among the 289 recruited children, 144 had a parasitemia >2500/microl. The results demonstrated markedly good efficacy for the treatment, as no detectable parasitemia was observed on day 28 for 97.9% of the children. However, we noticed that 35.3% of children did not comply with the recommended doses and 62.3% did not exactly adhere to the drug schedule. Despite the good efficacy of the drugs, adherence to the therapeutic scheme was poor. Strategies to promote patient adherence would improve drug performance and thus might help to prevent the rapid emergence of drug resistance."
CD011431,0,19461094,0,Requirements for diagnosis of malaria at different levels of the laboratory network in Africa.,"The rapid increase of resistance to cheap, reliable antimalarials, the increasing cost of effective drugs, and the low specificity of clinical diagnosis has increased the need for more reliable diagnostic methods for malaria. The most commonly used and most reliable remains microscopic examination of stained blood smears, but this technique requires skilled personnel, precision instruments, and ideally a source of electricity. Microscopy has the advantage of enabling the examiner to identify the species, stage, and density of an infection. An alternative to microscopy is the rapid diagnostic test (RDT), which uses a labeled monoclonal antibody to detect circulating parasitic antigens. This test is most commonly used to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections and is available in a plastic cassette format. Both microscopy and RDTs should be available at all levels of laboratory service in endemic areas, but in peripheral laboratories with minimally trained staff, the RDT may be a more practical diagnostic method."

In Germany around 1,000 tourists contract malaria every year, mostly travellers to Africa. Over 70% suffer from the life-threatening P. falciparum infection. Only a few days after the onset of this flu-like disease, complications may evolve. The best diagnostic method is the thin blood film. In case of a negative result this procedure must be repeated twice daily. The thick film requires experience. Rapid diagnostic tests can be helpful but are hampered by false negative results. Filaria loa loa may cause skin swellings, involvement of the eye and even the CNS; Wuchereria bancrofti can cause severe lymphedema.

We have developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the simultaneous identification of the 4 human Plasmodium spp. and quantification of Plasmodium DNA in human blood. The rapid turnaround and reduction in the risk of PCR product carryover are major advantages compared with conventional PCR. In combination with conventional tests, this method could be a powerful tool for the diagnosis of malaria infections among travellers from endemic areas and during the follow-up of patients in reference centres involved in travel and tropical medicine. Quantitative real-time PCR could also be used for the follow-up of patients during drug resistance studies managed by national malaria programmes, the testing of new drugs, and vaccine trials."

Consensus primers were used to amplify a species-specific region of the multicopy 18S rRNA gene, and SYBR Green was used for detection in a LightCycler instrument. Patient specimens infected at 0.01 to 0.02% parasitemia densities were detected, and analytical sensitivity was estimated to be 0.2 genome equivalent per reaction. Melting curve analysis based on nucleotide variations within the amplicons provided a basis for accurate differentiation of Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. For assay validation, 358 patient blood samples from the National University Hospital in Singapore and Evanston Northwestern Healthcare in Illinois were analyzed. Of 76 blinded patient samples with a microscopic diagnosis of P. falciparum, P. vivax, or P. ovale infection, 74 (97.4%) were detected by real-time PCR, including three specimens containing mixed P. falciparum-P. vivax infections. No Plasmodium DNA was amplified in any of the 82 specimens sent for malaria testing but that were microscopically negative for Plasmodium infection. In addition, 200 blood samples from patients whose blood was collected for reasons other than malaria testing were also determined to be negative by real-time PCR.

Given that human malaria can now be caused by five species of Plasmodium, i.e., Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and the recently included Plasmodium knowlesi, there is a critical need not only to augment global health efforts in malaria control but also, more importantly, to develop a rapid, accurate, species-sensitive/species-specific, and economically effective diagnostic method for malaria caused by these five species. Therefore, in the present study, a straightforward single-step hexaplex PCR system targeting five human Plasmodium 18S small-subunit rRNAs (ssu rRNAs) was designed, and the system successfully detected all five human malaria parasites. In addition, this system enables the differentiation of single infection as well as mixed infections up to the two-species level. This assay was validated with 50 randomly blinded test and 184 clinical samples suspected to indicate malaria. This hexaplex PCR system is not only an ideal alternative for routine malaria diagnosis in laboratories with conventional PCR machines but also adds value to diagnoses when there is a lack of an experienced microscopist or/and when the parasite morphology is confusing. Indeed, this system will definitely enhance the accuracy and accelerate the speed in the diagnosis of malaria, as well as improve the efficacy of malaria treatment and control, in addition to providing reliable data from epidemiological surveillance studies."

Microscopy has been the only test approved in the national policy for the diagnosis and management of malaria in Haiti; however, the use of microscopy often has been limited by lack of equipment or trained personnel. In contrast, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) require less equipment or training to use. To assist in the timely diagnosis and treatment of malaria in Haiti, the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP), in collaboration with CDC, conducted a field assessment that guided the decision to approve the use of RDTs. This data-driven policy change greatly expands the opportunities for accurate malaria diagnosis across the country, allows for improved clinical management of febrile patients, and will improve the quality of malaria surveillance in Haiti."

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) require less expertise, but accuracy under operational conditions has not been fully evaluated in Uganda. There are also concerns about RDTs that use the antigen histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) to detect Plasmodium falciparum, because this antigen can persist after effective treatment, giving false positive test results in the absence of infection.

CD011431,0,1670842,0,Rapid diagnosis of malaria by fluorescence microscopy with light microscope and interference filter.,"Fluorochrome staining to detect malaria parasites in bloodfilms is more sensitive, is easier to do, and is less time-consuming than Giemsa staining. However, standard epi-illuminated, mercury vapour, fluorescence microscopes are expensive, especially for tropical countries where malaria is endemic. Fluorescence microscopy with a standard light microscope and a new interference filter specially designed for the fluorochrome stain, acridine orange, was used to detect malaria parasites in thick and thin bloodfilms. In this system two fluorescence colours, green (nuclei) and red (cytoplasm), were emitted from stained parasites. Thick and thin bloodfilms from patients with malaria were examined with this system. Bloodfilms had been fixed and stored for 1-5 years. Rapid scanning of both thick and thin bloodfilms was possible at a magnification of x200 with standard lenses, indicating that this may be a useful economic system for rapid diagnosis of malarias."

He worked as an engineer for a month in Zambia and returned to Japan 2 days ago. He had a high-grade fever of 40.5 degrees C. Examination of the palpebral conjunctiva showed no evidence of anemia. Liver and spleen were not palpable. Blood sample was collected at the time of the febrile paroxysm. Malaria parasites were detected by examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood films. The dominant feature of parasite was early trophozoit with a low parasitemia (0.0469%, 1,857.6/microL). The James' stippling was absent. Schizonts and gametocytes were scarce. As ring morphology was quite variable, identification of species might not be possible. Identification of species is more difficult than usual, on the grounds that: 1) the blood sample contains rare early trophozoites, 2) the level of parasitemia is low, and 3) it is quite possible for parasites to be transformed due to the inappropriate treatment. Finally, the diagnosis was confirmed by nested PCR. Examination of Giemsa-stained blood films is the ""gold standard"" for detection and identification of organisms. However, in non-endemic countries, trained laboratory personnel are scarce and the most may be inexperienced in malaria diagnosis. It is recommended that personnel continue to gain experience by participating in external quality assurance schemes, and that routine laboratories utilize rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) concurrently. The availability of simple and accurate RDTs could aid the diagnosis in no-endemic countries."
CD011431,0,9070390,0,Evaluation of diagnostic tests for human leptospirosis.,"The IgM-PK-ELISA, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin M employing a proteinase K-treated antigen, and the ""Leptoteste-S"" macroagglutination test were evaluated for use in a rapid serodiagnosis of human leptospirosis. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was used as reference. The three serological tests were applied to serum samples from patients with leptospirosis (N = 89), typhoid fever (N = 8), malaria (N = 19), syphilis (N = 20), hepatitis (N = 16) and from clinically healthy donors (N = 92). The overall results of the IgM-PK-ELISA and the ""Leptoteste-S"" are comparable to those of the MAT. However, both tests differed statistically from MAT in terms of the positivity of the acute-phase sera, with approximately 38% of the patients with leptospirosis being identified earlier than when MAT was used. The IgM-PK-ELISA, with 89.9% sensitivity and 97.4% specificity, could be the test of choice for those laboratories which are equipped to perform ELISA. The ""Leptoteste-S"", with 89.9% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity, seems to be easier to perform and the most accessible to peripheral laboratories for rapid screening of human sera. Both techniques present the important characteristic of detecting early antibodies against leptospires, thus providing a diagnosis during the early stages of the disease."

We evaluated this technique in comparison with thin and thick Giemsa stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria in acute fever and PUO cases. The technique was slightly more sensitive than thin blood film but equal to thick blood film examination. Identification of species of malaria posed some difficulties. Due to its high cost and requirement for a fluorescent microscope this technique, in spite of its speed and sensitivity, may not have the potential to be a substitute for the conventional blood film examination for the diagnosis of malaria, especially in developing countries."

Here we describe an accurate and rapid alternative to conventional thick film examination (Lambaréné method). We also assess near-patient methods for measuring blood glucose (OneTouch) and lactate (Accusport). The accuracy of the Lambaréné method is similar to that of thin films. Results from the OneTouch glucose meter also are in good agreement with a YSI 2300 reference meter. Overall, the Accusport lactate meter agrees poorly with the YSI 2300 reference meter. However, the sensitivity and specificity to detect hyperlactatemia (blood lactate > or = 5 mmol/L) are 0.94 and 0.98, respectively."
CD011431,0,11716120,1,Detection of histidine rich protein 2 and panmalarial ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test antigens after chloroquine treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria does not reliably predict treatment outcome in eastern Indonesia.,"In regions with drug-resistant malaria, the ability to rapidly detect or predict treatment failure (TF) soon after a course of standard therapy for Plasmodium falciparum malaria would facilitate the prompt institution of second-line therapy. We thus evaluated longitudinally the ability of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv immunochromatographic test to predict treatment outcome. Sixty-six Sumbanese Indonesians with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were treated with chloroquine and followed for 28 days by use of 1997 World Health Organization criteria for assessment of therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs. The ICT Pf/Pv testing could be compared with microscopy in approximately half of the patients on each day of follow-up. Although strongly positive histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2) line intensities (equal to or greater than the control band) in convalescence were highly predictive of TF, any degree of positivity for the HRP2 and panmalarial antigens in convalescence was only moderately predictive of TE Positive predictive values of the HRP2 and panmalarial antigens for TF were 76.9% and 87.0%, respectively, on Day 3, 82.4% and 87.5% on Day 7, and 78.9% and 78.9% on Day 14. Negative HRP2 and panmalarial antigen results in convalescence were even less predictive of an adequate clinical response, and false-negative HRP2 and panmalarial antigen test results were found in one-sixth (6 of 37) of recrudescent infections diagnosed by microscopy among patients with late treatment failure. To reliably predict treatment outcome with rapid antigen tests, further development appears necessary to improve sensitivity for viable asexual parasites while avoiding detection of both gametocytes and persistent antigen in convalescence."

Malaria was diagnosed in 44 patients by Leishman staining technique and in 65 patients by QBC method. The QBC method allowed detection of an additional 21 cases. Thus the prevalence rate of malaria during the study was 22.65%. In 222 Patients who were negative by the QBC technique, the Leishman stained smears were also negative for malarial parasite. Although QBC method was superior to the smear for malarial parasite detection, species identification was difficult by this technique. The QBC method provides a reliable, quick, easily mastered, accurate method for diagnosis of malaria. The QBC system can also be used in the diagnosis of other parasitic diseases from blood (Filariasis). However, Leishman stained thin blood film still appear superior for species identification."
CD011431,0,17609321,0,Real-time PCR assay for rapid detection and analysis of PfCRT haplotypes of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum isolates from India.,"Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CRPF) malaria isolates in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa share the same Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) haplotype (CVIET; amino acids 72 to 76). It is believed that CRPF malaria emerged in Southeast Asia and spread to sub-Saharan Africa via the Indian subcontinent. Based on this assumption, we hypothesized that CRPF isolates in India should possess the same drug resistance haplotype (PfCRT haplotype CVIET) as P. falciparum isolates in Southeast Asia and Africa and that the prevalence of CRPF may be higher and more widespread in India than appreciated. To test this postulate, we utilized a standardized real-time PCR assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of PfCRT haplotypes in P. falciparum isolates (n = 406) collected from Western, Central, and Eastern states in India and compared them to isolates from South America and Africa. Based on the proportion of isolates possessing the molecular marker K76T, the prevalence of chloroquine resistance was high in all five regions of India studied (91%), as well as in Uganda (98%) and Suriname (100%). All isolates from Suriname contained the chloroquine-resistant SVMNT haplotype typical of South American isolates, and 98% of isolates from Uganda possessed the chloroquine-resistant CVIET haplotype characteristic of Southeast Asian/African strains. However, of 246 P. falciparum isolates from across India that contained the molecular marker for chloroquine resistance, 81% contained the SVMNT haplotype. In conclusion, the prevalence of CRPF malaria was high in geographically dispersed regions of India, and the primary haplotype observed, SVMNT, did not support a presumed geographic spread from contiguous Southeast Asia."
CD011431,0,1819395,0,[Malaria of the pregnant woman and the newborn].,"A 25 year-old primigravid woman developed chronic falciparum malaria at 23 weeks' gestation. Diagnosis was suspected on splenomegaly and haemolytic anaemia but without fever and confirmed by thin smears (Plasmodium falciparum) and serologic tests. She was successfully cured with chloroquine therapy. One week after her return from Cameroon, a 28 year-old woman was seen for malaria at 32 weeks' gestation. In spite of chloroquine therapy, foetal troubles appeared and a caesarean was performed. The newborn had an APGAR coefficient of 3 points and examination both of his blood films and the placenta revealed numerous trophozoites of P. falciparum. Chloroquine resulted in a rapid cure of the child. In endemic areas, parasitaemia is more frequent and dense during pregnancy, and especially in primigravidae. However, clinical symptoms remain rare because of acquired immunity. In case of no or loss of immunity, malarial infections are heavy and abortions are frequent. Congenital malaria is probably due to transplacental transfer of infected red blood cells of the mother. In endemic areas, the incidence is low due to the simultaneously transferred immunity. Emergency treatment is necessary because of life-threatening to both mother and child."

This prospective descriptive study was conducted in public and private health centers in Antananarivo in 2010, from May 1 to June 30. Adhesion to the new policy included adoption of the rapid diagnostic test for malaria (RDT) and/or microscopy as diagnostic methods and prescription of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 106 physicians. Their average age was 43.9 years (range: 26 to 59 years). The male-female sex-ratio was 0.59. Physicians trained in using RDTs were confident in this means of diagnosis (p < 10(-4)). Prescription of ACT by physicians was associated with their participation in malaria training (p = 0.02). Only 2/3 of the physicians adhered to the current policy. Adherence increased with trust (p < 10(-4)), availability of RDT (p < 10(-5)), and training about the policy. Physician adhesion, training and confidence are essential to this policy and to changing physician behavior. Improvement of the health system is also needed."

Dengue fever (DF) is likely to contribute; however, its epidemiology in PNG is poorly understood. We performed a prospective age-stratified study in outpatient clinics investigating the prevalence of DF; 578 patients were enrolled, and 317 patients with a negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria were tested for dengue. Malaria was confirmed in 52% (301/578, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 48-56%), DF was diagnosed in 8% (46/578, 95% CI = 6-10%), and 40% (95% CI = 36-44%) had neither diagnosis. Among the 317 malaria RDT-negative patients, 14% (45/317, 95% CI = 10-18%) had DF. The seroprevalence of dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 83% (204/247, 95% CI = 78-87%), and no dengue hemorrhagic fever was seen. This study provides good evidence for the first time that DF is common in PNG and is responsible for 8% of fever episodes. The common occurrence of DF in a population with presumed previous exposure to dengue is an important observation."
CD011431,0,17153692,0,Detection of malaria in Saudi Arabia by real-time PCR.,"Malaria transmission occurs in Saudi Arabia and mainly endemic in the lowlands of Asir region, the Southwester Province. Imported cases have been reported. Sensitive routine laboratory techniques for rapid and accurate malaria diagnosis are therefore desirable to facilitate the identification of individuals infected with the malarial parasites and to follow up the progress of treatment of such cases with appropriate drugs. Traditional diagnosis, based on the microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin films remains the main standard method of diagnosis used for malaria diagnosis in Saudi Arabia. Molecular diagnostic techniques based on the detection of nucleic acids (as PCR; Real-time PCR) are now highly considered. Real time-PCR a new methodology has been recently applied to detect human malaria. In this study a total of forty four samples, using whole-blood, dried blood and thick smears were examined by PCR and Real-time PCR. Both techniques showed a higher sensitivity than the microscopy. Parasites were detected in twenty nine samples out of forty four, compared to twenty six of thirty nine were positive with thin blood film. The real-time PCR assay offers a practical and positive alternative for rapid and accurate diagnosis for malaria infection. The application of such technique will be significantly valuable especially for screening for malaria infection in endemic areas."

ICT was applied in 674 febrile returnees from malaria-endemic regions attending our Tropical Diseases Unit. Microscopy confirmed malaria in 69/674 cases, of whom 67/69 had returned from Africa or Madagascar, and 2/69 from the Caribbean. Monoparasitic P.f. infection occurred in 52/69, mixed infection was due to P.f.+ P. ovale (P.o.) in 3/69, and P.f.+P. malariae (P.m.) in 1/69 cases. Monoparasitic P. vivax (P.v.) infection occurred in 8/69 , P.o. in 3/69, and P.m. in 2/69 cases . Whereas a positive HRP-2 band on the test was a highly sensitive indicator for P.f. infection (52/52 patients; sensitivity 100%), this was not the case for a positive aldolase band (25/52 patients; sensitivity 48.1%). Sensitivity of aldolase band for non-falciparum plasmodia was even lower: aldolase was positive in only 3/8 (37.5%) of patients with vivax malaria, and in 0/5 cases with P.o.- or P.m. infection. Co-reaction of both bands occurred more frequently in patients with P.f. parasitaemia of > or =40,000/microl (20/25, 80.0%) as compared to patients with P.f. parasitaemia <40,000/microl (5/27, 18.5%; P<0.00005), and to patients with mixed infection (P.f.+ P.o., P.f.+ P.m.: 2/4, 50.0%; diff. n.s.). In our series, co-reaction of HRP-2 and aldolase indicated monoparasitic falciparum malaria with high P.f. parasitaemia, rather than mixed infection. Whereas the aldolase band is not a reliable qualitative marker for malaria, co-reaction of HRP-2 and aldolase band may have a potential for indicating high parasitaemia in falciparum malaria."
CD011431,0,19173772,1,"Rapid diagnostic tests for the home-based management of malaria, in a high-transmission area.","Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are sometimes recommended to improve the home-based management of malaria. The accuracy of an RDT for the detection of clinical malaria and the presence of malarial parasites has recently been evaluated in a high-transmission area of southern Mali. During the same study, the cost-effectiveness of a 'test-and-treat' strategy for the home-based management of malaria (based on an artemisinin-combination therapy) was compared with that of a 'treat-all' strategy. Overall, 301 patients, of all ages, each of whom had been considered a presumptive case of uncomplicated malaria by a village healthworker, were checked with a commercial RDT (Paracheck-Pf). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of this test, compared with the results of microscopy and two different definitions of clinical malaria, were then determined. The RDT was found to be 82.9% sensitive (with a 95% confidence interval of 78.0%-87.1%) and 78.9% (63.9%-89.7%) specific compared with the detection of parasites by microscopy. In the detection of clinical malaria, it was 95.2% (91.3%-97.6%) sensitive and 57.4% (48.2%-66.2%) specific compared with a general practitioner's diagnosis of the disease, and 100.0% (94.5%-100.0%) sensitive but only 30.2% (24.8%-36.2%) specific when compared against the fulfillment of the World Health Organization's (2003) research criteria for uncomplicated malaria. Among children aged 0-5 years, the cost of the 'test-and-treat' strategy, per episode, was about twice that of the 'treat-all' (U.S.$1.0. v. U.S.$0.5). In older subjects, however, the two strategies were equally costly (approximately U.S.$2/episode). In conclusion, for children aged 0-5 years in a high-transmission area of sub-Saharan Africa, use of the RDT was not cost-effective compared with the presumptive treatment of malaria with an ACT. In older patients, use of the RDT did not reduce costs. The question remains whether either of the strategies investigated can be made affordable for the affected population."
CD011431,0,9509627,1,"Comparative performance of the ParaSight F test for detection of Plasmodium falciparum in malaria-immune and nonimmune populations in Irian Jaya, Indonesia.","A comparison was made of the performance of the ParaSight F test (F test) for detection of Plasmodium falciparum in blood from malaria-immune (410 native Irianese) and nonimmune (369 new transmigrants) populations in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, where malaria is hyperendemic and all four species of human malaria occur. There were highly significant differences between populations in the sensitivity (Irianese, 60% versus transmigrants, 84%; P < 0.001) and specificity (Irianese, 97% versus transmigrants, 84%; P < 0.001) of the F test. The test had comparably high levels of sensitivity for Irianese children aged < or = 10 years, both age groups of transmigrants (76-85%), but low sensitivity for Irianese aged > 10 years (40%), among whom only 7% of parasitaemias < 120 per microliter and 69% of those > 120 per microliter were detected. Specificity was comparably high for transmigrant children aged < or = 10 years and both age groups of Irianese (93-98%). The low specificity for transmigrants aged > 10 years (79%) was due to a preponderance of false positives, frequently identified by microscopy as P. vivax. The results suggest that comparison based on microscopy underestimated the performance of the ParaSight F test and that malaria immune status, irrespective of P. falciparum density, may influence the test's sensitivity."
CD011431,0,18983278,1,Evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test specific for Plasmodium vivax.,"Plasmodium vivax is the only human malaria indigenous to the Republic of Korea (ROK). A rapid and sensitive diagnostic test (RDT) that detects P. vivax is appropriate for evaluating suspected malaria patients with no travel history abroad. The RDTs, SD Malaria Antigen P.v (SD diagnostic, Kyonggi, ROK) specific for P. vivax and the well documented OptiMAL (DiaMed, Cressier, Switzerland) were compared among 282 volunteers for specificity and sensitivity of P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria infections against Giemsa-stained blood smears read by an experienced microscopist. A total of 137 volunteers were diagnosed with P. vivax, 45 cases (returned travellers from overseas) were diagnosed with P. falciparum and 100 healthy volunteers were diagnosed as negative for malaria. Correspondingly, the SD Malaria Antigen P.v test identified P. vivax infections in 128/137 malaria patients (93.4%) and 0/100 (0%) healthy volunteers. Three patients identified with P. falciparum also were interpreted as P. vivax by the SD Malaria Antigen P.v test; however, these patients were later confirmed as mixed infections of P. vivax and P. falciparum by polymerase chain reaction. OptiMAL interpreted the three mixed infections only as P. falciparum and detected 130/137 (94.9%) patients with P. vivax. The sensitivity of the SD Malaria Antigen P.v test decreased from 100% (>5000 parasite/microl) to 81.3% (1-100 parasites/microl) as parasitaemia levels declined. For the regions where P. vivax is the primary malaria parasite, the SD P. vivax-specific rapid diagnostic test may be useful for screening suspected malaria patients when sufficient material and human resources (e.g. trained microscopists) are unavailable for malaria diagnosis."

Malaria diagnosis, with conventional Giemsa staining as a gold standard, has had several limitations. New rapid and accurate methods are needed for diagnosis. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis specific for diagnosis of P. falciparum was evaluated. For the study, blood samples were collected from 310 patients suspected of having malaria. PCR analysis for P. falciparum from venous blood and at the same time Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears was done. A total of 160 (51.6 %) samples were positive for malarial parasite of which 63 (39.4 %) were positive for P. falciparum by Giemsa staining while 61 (38.1 %) were positive for P. falciparum by PCR analysis. Giemsa staining was time consuming, laborious and may give poor results in cases with low parasitaemia. The PCR analysis for P. falciparum was able to detect 3 cases of low parasitaemia missed initially on Giemsa staining, was 96.8 % sensitive, 100% specific but was very costly, needed a lot of practice and standardization and was time consuming. PCR analysis can be used to supplement the conventional Giemsa staining for reliable diagnosis of falciparum malaria especially in cases with low parasitaemia."

CD011431,0,8952670,0,[Advances in genetics: what benefits children?].,"The advent of genetic therapy has raised great hopes, but it is clear that for children and their parents, the primary benefit from recent progress is in the possibility of positive diagnosis and presymptomatic diagnosis allowing more adapted management. For the family, genetic counselling allows well informed family planning and birth of healthy children. For the child to be born, continuing progress in genotypic diagnosis often leads to very delicate questions during the antenatal period, especially since certain diagnoses are still difficult and prognosis less than sure. The wide range of tools in molecular genetics may provide the answer in many situations. The rapid development of genetic tools in developed countries should now raise the question of their use in developing countries. This point might have a particular impact in research on genetic factors and sensibility to frequent infectious diseases such as tuberculosis or malaria. In this case, the aim is not diagnosis but the discovery of genes regulating susceptibility which could lead to pharmaceutical developments. This is undoubtedly a long term objective, but should not be overlooked."

CD011431,0,7906328,1,Diagnosis of malaria by detection of Plasmodium falciparum HRP-2 antigen with a rapid dipstick antigen-capture assay.,"Two field studies in Kenya and an experimental challenge study in the USA were done to assess the accuracy of a dipstick antigen-capture assay based on qualitative detection of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2) in peripheral blood for diagnosis of P falciparum infection. In these studies, the assay was 96.5-100% sensitive for detection of greater than 60 P falciparum asexual parasites/microL blood, 70-81% sensitive for 11-60 parasites/microL blood, and 11-67% sensitive for 10 parasites or less/microL blood. Specificity was 95% (95% CI 85-105%; n = 20) among naive American volunteers, 98% (96-101%; n = 112) among volunteers exposed to the bite of P falciparum-infected mosquitoes, and 88% (84-92%; n = 285) among Kenyans living in an area with holoendemic malaria. Our results also indicated that PfHRP-2 antigen was not detectable in blood 6 days after initiation of curative chemotherapy, and suggest that such circulating antigens rarely lead to false-positive tests. The dipstick assay's sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and speed may make it an important tool in the battle against malaria."
CD011431,0,16887738,0,Malaria.,Malaria is increasing worldwide due to the emergence and spread of drug resistant strains. This poses major health and economic problems for the population living in endemic areas and increases the risk of infections in travelers. The diagnosis of malaria relies on a biological proof of infection by microscopy or with a rapid test. The treatment must be initiated without delay preferably with an artemisinin containing regimen. Uncomplicated malaria can be treated with oral drugs while severe infections will be hospitalized and treated with injectables. Special attention will be given to the most susceptible groups: children and pregnant women.

Because each Plasmodium species has different biological and clinical characteristics, accurate differentiation of the infecting species is essential for effective treatment. Therefore, we produced three monoclonal antibodies that recognize the lactate dehydrogenase of P. falciparum, P. vivax, or both to develop the first P. falciparum, P. vivax, and mixed-species infections malaria antigen detection kit. The detection limits of this kit were 150 and 250 parasites/μL for P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively, and the kit was able to detect mixed-species infections. The sensitivity and specificity of this kit was assessed with 722 clinical specimens. Our results showed that its sensitivities for P. falciparum, P. vivax, and mixed-species infection were 96.5%, 95.3%, and 85.7%, respectively. In addition, its specificity was high (99.4%)."
CD011431,0,23637865,0,A novel flow cytometric hemozoin detection assay for real-time sensitivity testing of Plasmodium falciparum.,"Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to almost all antimalarial drugs, including the first-line treatment with artemisinins, has been described, representing an obvious threat to malaria control. In vitro antimalarial sensitivity testing is crucial to detect and monitor drug resistance. Current assays have been successfully used to detect drug effects on parasites. However, they have some limitations, such as the use of radioactive or expensive reagents or long incubation times. Here we describe a novel assay to detect antimalarial drug effects, based on flow cytometric detection of hemozoin (Hz), which is rapid and does not require any additional reagents. Hz is an optimal parasite maturation indicator since its amount increases as the parasite matures. Due to its physical property of birefringence, Hz depolarizes light, hence it can be detected using optical methods such as flow cytometry. A common flow cytometer was adapted to detect light depolarization caused by Hz. Synchronized in vitro cultures of P. falciparum were incubated for 48 hours with several antimalarial drugs. Analysis of depolarizing events, corresponding to parasitized red blood cells containing Hz, allowed the detection of parasite maturation. Moreover, chloroquine resistance and the inhibitory effect of all antimalarial drugs tested, except for pyrimethamine, could be determined as early as 18 to 24 hours of incubation. At 24 hours incubation, 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were comparable to previously reported values. These results indicate that the reagent-free, real-time Hz detection assay could become a novel assay for the detection of drug effects on Plasmodium falciparum."
CD011431,0,9815250,0,Effects of viral hemorrhagic fever inactivation methods on the performance of rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum.,"Blood samples from patients with viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) pose a serious risk to laboratory workers. Current contingency plans for VHF samples recommend the use of heat, gamma-irradiation, or Triton X-100 to inactivate samples before handling. Malaria is the most important alternative diagnosis to be excluded in cases of suspected VHF. Interpretation of malaria smears using samples inactivated with these methods is problematic because morphology is altered. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of different inactivation methods on the performance of rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum. Triton X-100 and gamma-irradiation of samples preserved detection. The impact of Triton X-100 inactivation was also ""blindly"" evaluated using 100 blood samples from febrile travelers. Triton X-100 inactivation of samples did not significantly affect the performance of these tests. This may represent a useful strategy for excluding the diagnosis of falciparum malaria in cases of suspected VHF."

CD011431,0,16156968,0,"Investigation of the kinetics of histidine-rich protein 2 and of the antibody responses to this antigen, in a group of malaria patients from India.","Although immunological tests based on the detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) from the parasites permit the rapid diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, such tests are not yet sufficiently sensitive to detect every bloodsmear-positive case. Some individuals infected with P. falciparum may appear test-negative because of the presence of anti-HRP2 antibodies in their sera. A longitudinal follow-up of HRP2 antigenaemia and antibody responses to this antigen has now been conducted in a group of 45, bloodsmear-positive malaria cases of various ages, both during acute infection with P. falciparum and after antimalarial treatment. Pre-treatment, 'day-0' samples of fingerprick blood were tested for HRP2 (in antigen-capture ELISA) and for antigen-specific IgM and IgG (in indirect ELISA). The patients were then treated, with standard doses of chloroquine, before being retested, for HRP2 and anti-HRP2 antibodies, on days 7, 15 and 28. The level of antigenaemia, which on day 0 was found to be positively correlated with parasitaemia (r = 0.741; P < 0.001), had only fallen by an insignificant amount by day 7 but showed further, significant falls between days 7 and 15 (P < 0.001) and between days 15 and 28 (P < 0.01). Although no significant relationship was observed between the blood concentrations of HRP2 and anti-HRP2 IgM or IgG on days 0 or 7, the level of HRP2 antigenaemia was found to be positively correlated with the concurrent titre of anti-HRP2 IgM on day 15 (r = 0.612; P < 0.001) and day 28 (r = 0.501; P < 0.001). The titres of HRP2-specific IgG gradually increased over the 28 days of follow-up but were not found to be significantly correlated with the decreasing levels of HRP2 antigenaemia. When the 45 day-0 samples of blood were tested for HRP2 in a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), three appeared negative, probably because of interference from the circulating, free, anti-HRP2 antibodies in the plasma. The three RDT-negative samples were significantly different from the 42 RDT-positive, having relatively low HRP2 antigenaemias (P < 0.001) and relatively high titres of anti-HRP2 IgM (P < 0.05) and IgG (P < 0.001). Control samples of blood, from four patients infected with P. vivax and five healthy, normal individuals, were considered ELISA-negative for HRP2 and anti-HRP2 IgM or IgG. It appears that, during human infection with P. falciparum, serum levels of HRP2 antigen remain elevated for at least 7 days post-treatment, despite the host's development of antigen-specific immune responses both before and after treatment."

This compact and cost-effective digital RDT reader, weighing only ~65 g, mechanically attaches to the existing camera unit of a cellphone, where various types of RDTs can be inserted to be imaged in reflection or transmission modes under light-emitting diode (LED)-based illumination. Captured raw images of these tests are then digitally processed (within less than 0.2 s per image) through a smart application running on the cellphone for validation of the RDT, as well as for automated reading of its diagnostic result. The same smart application then transmits the resulting data, together with the RDT images and other related information (e.g., demographic data), to a central server, which presents the diagnostic results on a world map through geo-tagging. This dynamic spatio-temporal map of various RDT results can then be viewed and shared using internet browsers or through the same cellphone application. We tested this platform using malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV RDTs by installing it on both Android-based smartphones and an iPhone.

In this study, we evaluated the recently developed Partec rapid malaria test (PM) for the detection of Plasmodium spp. in human blood from patients in an area where malaria is endemic and compared the results with those of thick blood film Giemsa stain (GS) in terms of its performance and operational characteristics, using real-time (RT) PCR as the gold standard. The sensitivities of the PM and the GS were 62.2% (95% CI, 56.3 to 67.8) and 61.8% (95% CI, 55.9 to 67.4), respectively, while the specificities were 96.0% (95% CI, 92.3 to 98.3) and 98% (95% CI, 95.0 to 99.5), respectively. There was an excellent agreement between the results for the PM and those of the GS (k [level of agreement] = 0.96; P < 0.001). The results for the PM were obtained more quickly and at less cost than those for the GS. The performance characteristics of the PM were almost equal to those of the GS, but the operational characteristics were better, and the PM can therefore be considered as an alternative method for GS."

CD011431,0,9683894,0,A review of practical techniques for the diagnosis of malaria.,"Malaria is a global health problem, responsible for nearly 3 million deaths each year, and on the increase worldwide. Improvements in malaria diagnostics should facilitate the identification of individuals infected with the malarial parasites and the treatment of such cases with appropriate drugs. Both traditional and contemporary methods for malaria diagnosis are the subjects of the present review. Traditional diagnosis, based on the examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears under a microscope, is inappropriate for many areas because there are insufficient microscopes and/or trained microscopists to read and interpret the slides. Such traditional methods are discussed in the context of parasite quantification. Newer, more advanced malaria diagnostics are now available and the relative merits of methods based on fluorescent microscopy or the detection of nucleic acid (including PCR) are described, including comparisons of costs. Fluorescent microscopy and nucleic-acid techniques both require skills and equipment which are not universally available in many malaria-endemic countries. Recently introduced diagnostic tests based on immuno-assays solve this problem since they are easy to run and interpret, and do not require complex equipment or technical support. They are also rapid (< 10 min/test), cost-effective and at least as sensitive as traditional microscopy."

The ED is busy, usually overcrowded, understaffed and under-equipped, resulting in less than optimal patient management. Children are a highly vulnerable group of patients and have the potential to deteriorate rapidly. This prospective descriptive study aimed to assess the adequacy of management of children presenting to the ED between 1600 and 0800 hours. A standardized and individually administered questionnaire was used to assess the management of 107 children. The median age was 13 months, interquartile range 6-36 months, with a male to female ratio of 1.5:1. The most frequent diagnoses were pneumonia/bronchiolitis, diarrhoea, malaria, asthma and febrile convulsions. Three-quarters of the sample were classified as being triage 1 and 2, ie, requiring either immediate life-saving treatment or treatment within 30 minutes to an hour of presentation. Median and interquartile ranges for time from arrival to assessment were 60 (15-110) minutes for triage 1, and 60 (30-121) minutes for triage 2 patients. Time from assessment to management was 5 (5-45) minutes for triage 1 and 40 (30-63) minutes for triage 2 patients. Treatment instituted was appropriate in 93% of cases but the drug dosage was incorrect in 26%. 49 children (46%) were admitted to the wards either directly or following further observation in the ED or Children's Outpatient Department, the rest being treated and discharged, except for one child with probable septicaemia who died following a prolonged and unattended wait in the ED. Management was assessed as adequate in only 40% of cases. The major causes of inadequate management were delayed treatment, under- or over-dosing, under- or over-treatment, omission of appropriate investigations, misdiagnosis and failure of judicious consultation with the paediatric team. Many patients were nursed on the floor. Recommendations emanating from the study include ensuring adequate staffing levels and the training of all staff working in ED in the rapid identification of sick children to improve triage and subsequent management."

Recent breakthroughs in drug development (artemisinin-based combination treatments), preventive interventions (long-lasting, insecticide-treated bed nets), improved diagnosis (rapid diagnostic tests), and community mobilization have resulted in deployment of new antimalarial tools. National programs supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative, and other donors have resulted in substantial reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality. Bill and Melinda Gates have given great impetus to eradication with support for the development of key research strategies and direct funding of innovative research projects, including malaria vaccine and drug discovery, that could decrease disease and transmission. Linking research to field operations is a strategy that succeeded for smallpox eradication and will be required for the demise of malaria."
CD011431,0,22049032,0,Nuclear magnetic resonance: a tool for malaria diagnosis?,"Malaria control can be improved by rapid, sensitive, low-cost detection of infection. Several such strategies are being pursued. Rapid diagnostic tests can detect infections at parasite densities above 200 μL(-1). Polymerase chain reaction methods can detect low parasite densities, but are slow and prone to contamination under field conditions. Methods that detect hemozoin presence in blood have been proposed as alternatives for rapid detection of infection. In this study, we used a benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) device to detect hemozoin. This device could be deployed in malaria-endemic settings. We measured synthetic hemozoin in phosphate-buffered saline and malaria parasites in human blood. The NMR detected hemozoin in suspensions of 4 ng μL(-1) and parasites at densities of 8,000-10,000 μL(-1) (0.2% parasitemia). Thus, our preliminary NMR approach, although providing very rapid measurements, is unlikely to achieve the required sensitivity and specificity for malaria diagnosis, unless a preliminary concentration step is performed."
CD011431,0,19270300,1,Performance of malaria rapid diagnostic tests as part of routine malaria case management in Kenya.,"Data on malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) performance under routine program conditions are limited. We assessed the attributes of RDTs performed by study and health facility (HF) staffs as part of routine malaria case management of patients > or = 5 years of age in Kenya. Expert microscopy was used as our gold standard. A total of 1,827 patients were enrolled; 191 (11.6%) were parasitemic by expert microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of RDTs performed by study staff were 86.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79.8-93.5%) and 95.4% (95% CI: 93.9-96.9%), respectively. Among tests performed by HF staff, RDTs were 91.7% (95% CI: 80.8-100.0%) sensitive and 96.7% (95% CI: 92.8-100.0%) specific, whereas microscopy was 52.5% (95% CI: 33.2-71.9%) sensitive and 77.0% (95% CI: 67.9-86.2%) specific. Our findings suggest that RDTs perform better than microscopy under routine conditions. Further efforts are needed to maintain this high RDT performance over time."

CD011431,0,11293505,1,Evaluation of diagnostic methods of re-emerging malaria in Korean patients.,"Malaria is one of the most important parasitic diseases especially in tropical areas. Over 300 million people are affected and the condition causes 1-3 million deaths each year. It is transmitted by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Although Korea was declared to be free of Malaria by the WHO in 1979, malaria re-emergence has been apparent since 1993 amongst soldiers located near the De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) in the northern part of the country. Conventional microscopic examination of thin and thick blood films demonstrates the presence of the parasite and thus this method has been used to confirm the diagnosis of malaria, but it is a labor-intensive procedure and relies upon subjective interpretation. To overcome these limitations, fast and reliable methods for malaria detection have been recently introduced. In this study, we compared three kinds of antibody detection kits and one biochemical test kit that determines the presence of Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) with conventional peripheral blood smears. The antibody detection methods examined were, two rapid test pack format methods and a single microplate format enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, as manufactured by Korean companies. The sensitivities of the three commercial antibody detection kits in the early stage of malaria were 70.8%, 77.4%, and 63.6%, their corresponding specificities 90.5%, 91.8%, and 80.9%, and their accuracies 87.6%, 87.0%, and 76.7%. The sensitivity and specificity of the pLDH assay were 100% apiece and the results were in 100% concordance with the microscopy of thick blood films. Thus, the pLDH assay may be used as an alternative for conventional microscopic blood film examination, especially in emergency situations when prompt treatment is necessary."

While ""malaria cases"" are reported in health facilities throughout the year, past and current climatic and ecological conditions do not favour transmission in the dry season (lack of rainfall and very high temperatures). Moreover, entomological investigations in neighbouring regions point to an absence of malaria transmission in mosquito vectors in the dry season.

CD011431,0,23389615,0,Public health challenges and prospects for malaria control and elimination.,"The past decade witnessed unprecedented efforts to control malaria, including renewed political and financial commitment and increased availability of both old and new strategies and tools. However, malaria still represents a major health burden, particularly in Africa. Important challenges such as the fragility of many health systems, the rise of insecticide and drug resistance, and particularly the expected decline both in funding and in the coverage of key interventions if they are not replaced as needed, urgently need to be addressed. Further research and development is also becoming increasingly crucial. Among other needs, common methodologies for estimating and tracking the malaria burden, new strategies to measure transmission, better understanding of immunity, and increased knowledge of the mechanisms and effects of resistance to drugs and insecticides stand out. The ongoing efforts in research and development for new antimalarial drugs, more sensitive point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests and new insecticides need further innovation and substantial strengthening. Clearly, efforts should focus not only on Plasmodium falciparum but also and increasingly on Plasmodium vivax, the neglected human malaria parasite. Addressing these challenges in a comprehensive and timely way will allow us to sustain the gains made so far and make further progress in control and progressive elimination."

The use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) based on histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) synthesized by Plasmodium falciparum has been widely advocated to save costs and to minimize inappropriate treatment of non-malarial febrile illnesses.

CD011431,0,8944275,0,Features of recrudescent chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections confer a survival advantage on parasites and have implications for disease control.,"This paper reports on the features of recrudescent infections of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CQRPf) malaria from a study in vivo of patients from a malaria endemic (n = 527) and non-endemic (n = 129) region of Sri Lanka where the incidence of RI resistance was 30% and 55%, respectively. In both groups of patients, the recrudescent infections which emerged after treatment of the primary infection with chloroquine (CQ) and primaquine had significantly lower peripheral parasitaemia (0.036% and 0.108% in endemic and non-endemic patients, respectively) compared to their primary infections (mean parasitaemia 0.13% and 0.49%; P = 0.021 and 0.002, respectively). The recrudescences of CQ resistant infections also gave rise to clinical disease of markedly reduced severity (average clinical scores of 10.1 and 8.2) compared to their primary infections (average clinical scores of 12.4 and 12.3; P = 0.003 and 0.001, respectively, in endemic and non-endemic patients). CQ resistant recrudescent infections therefore had a lower probability of being diagnosed and treated. In endemic patients, a higher proportion of CQRPf infections (57%) had gametocytaemia compared to the chloroquine sensitive ones (29%) (P = 0.014, chi 2 = 5.96) and were significantly more infective to mosquitoes (P = 0.047). these findings imply that, in areas where CQ resistance is prevalent, the continued use of the drug may confer a survival and propagation advantage on resistant parasites and favour the rapid expansion of their reservoir. In support of this, we also present epidemiological evidence showing that, in endemic areas, the proportion of P. falciparum patients carrying gametocytes has increased significantly since the emergence of chloroquine resistance. These findings are relevant to the management of drug resistance and malaria control in countries where P.falciparum is only partially resistant to CQ."
CD011431,0,16778310,0,The epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis in Bangladesh: prospects for improved control.,"The parasitic disease kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis, VL) was first described in 1824 in Jessore district, Bengal (now Bangladesh). Epidemic peaks were recorded in Bengal in the 1820s, 1860s, 1920s, and 1940s. After achieving good control of the disease during the intensive vector control efforts for malaria in the 1950s-1960s, Bangladesh experienced a VL resurgence that has lasted to the present. Surveillance data show an increasing trend in incidence since 1995. Research in recent years has demonstrated the utility of non-invasive diagnostic modalities such as the direct agglutination test and rapid tests based on the immune response to the rK39 antigen. In common with its neighbours India and Nepal, VL in Bangladesh is anthroponotic. Living in proximity to a kala-azar case is the strongest risk factor for disease, while consistent use of bed nets in the summer months and the presence of cattle are protective. Shortages of first-line antileishmanial drugs and insecticide for indoor spraying programmes have hindered VL treatment and vector control efforts. Effective control of VL will require activities to improve availability and access to diagnostic testing and antileishmanial drugs, enhanced surveillance for kala-azar, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis and VL treatment failures, and increased coverage and efficacy of vector control programmes."

His P. knowlesi infection was not detected using microscopic examination and a rapid diagnostic test for malaria, but was confirmed by both PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and sequence analysis showing homology with the ribosomal RNA gene for P. knowlesi. He responded rapidly to treatment with artemether & lumefantrine combination. The evolution of a rapid diagnostic kit to diagnose P. knowlesi is needed, for early identification and appropriate anti-malarial therapy of suspect cases are both critical in the prevention of the potentially life-threatening disease through P. knowlesi.

During a 7-year period, first the MalaQuick rapid test and then the NOW Malaria test, were evaluated by well-trained laboratory technicians in a university hospital laboratory of parasitology. A total of 635 blood samples were selected from 4731 blood specimens obtained from travellers at the emergency department, at wards and at out-patient clinics. The samples were analysed by microscopy and RDT. Malaria parasites were detected in the blood films of 134 (21%) samples. The sensitivity of the RDT for Plasmodium falciparum was 97.7% (84 of 86 samples) with a negative predictive value of 99.6%. The two false-negative results were associated with low levels of parasitaemia. For non-falciparum species the sensitivity was only 58.3% (28 of 48 samples). Based on the excellent ability of the RDTs to detect P. falciparum infections, we recommend the use of the NOW Malaria test as a complement to microscopy in the laboratory."

CD011431,0,20089781,0,Active malaria morbidity management has limited impact on height status of preschool Senegalese children.,"Although infections contribute to growth faltering in preschool children, malaria prevention seems to have limited impact on height status. In 2002-2003, a malaria intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) trial was conducted in Senegal, including randomly selected preschool children from 11 villages. A rapid decrease in stunting prevalence (from 28.3 to 16.3%; P < 0.0001) was reported in both intervention and placebo groups. During this 15-mo period, both groups of children benefited from active detection and prompt treatment of malaria attacks. In this study, we investigated whether management of malaria morbidity could explain the improvement of height status. An anthropometric survey, conducted in September 2004 in the area, included 929 2- to 5-y-old children. Some 539 children, previously included in the 2002-2003 IPT trial, benefited from active malaria morbidity management and formed the malaria trial group. The remaining 390 children constituted the control group. Mean height-for-age and stunting prevalence in September 2004 were compared between groups adjusting for age and mother's activity. Mean height-for-age Z-scores did not differ between trial (-1.17 +/- 0.93) and control children (-1.24 +/- 1.00; P = 0.25). Only 36- to 47-mo-old malaria trial children had a lower prevalence of stunting than controls of similar age (19.4 vs. 28.7%; P = 0.044). Compared with the usually slow progression of height status related to better living conditions, it seems very likely that the rapid improvement observed among IPT study children resulted from the trial. These findings suggest that improved health services provided by the trial may also have benefited children not included living in study villages."

Here we report the evaluation of four rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosis of this disease. A total of 253 subjects were enrolled in the study. The sensitivities, specificities and agreement frequencies were estimated by comparing the four RDTs against the standard of nested-PCR and microscopic examination. The CareStart(TM) and SD Bioline had higher test sensitivities (99.4 and 98.8%, respectively) compared with the NanoSign and Asan Easy tests (93.0 and 94.7%, respectively). The CareStart(TM) and SD Bioline tests could detect P. vivax in samples with parasite densities <150/μl, which was a slightly better performance than the other two RDTs. The quantitative accuracy of the four RDTs was also estimated by comparing results with P. vivax counts from blood samples. Lower test price would result in increased use of these RDTs in the field. The results of this study contribute valuable information that will aid in the selection of a diagnostic method for the detection of malaria."

CD011431,0,9080879,1,The use of a dipstick antigen-capture assay for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection in a remote forested area of central India.,"A study was carried out in a highly malarious forested belt of central India (Madhya Pradesh) to evaluate the usefulness of a dipstick antigen-capture assay (ParaSight F) as a diagnostic method for Plasmodium falciparum appropriate for field use. In all, 1,231 patients with fever were screened in parallel with the taking of thick blood smears. The sensitivity and specificity of the dipstick test for detection of P. falciparum were 93% and 92.5%, respectively. Results also indicate that the dipstick test result became negative within seven days after initiation of curative chemotherapy in the majority of cases (95%). Tribal populations in remote forested areas are important reservoirs of P. falciparum that are mostly resistant to standard antimalarial drugs and a source of malaria to the rest of the country. Control of malaria is limited by inaccessibility, lack of medical services, public ignorance of the disease, and other technical problems. In this population, the dipstick assay was found to be highly accurate, simple, and rapid, suggesting that it may be used in remote forested areas without the need for microscopic examination. The simplicity of the dipstick test enabled administration of more effective and expensive antimalarials preventing further buildup and dissemination of resistant parasites and a return of symptoms."

CD011431,0,18784230,0,"Challenges in routine implementation and quality control of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria--Rufiji District, Tanzania.","Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) represent an alternative to microscopy for malaria diagnosis and have shown high sensitivity and specificity in a variety of study settings. Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for quality control of RDTs provide detailed instructions on pre-field testing, but offer little guidance for quality assurance once RDTs are deployed in health facilities. From September 2006 to April 2007, we introduced a histidine-rich protein II (HRP2)-based RDT (Paracheck) for suspected malaria cases five years of age and older in nine health facilities in Rufiji District, Tanzania, to assess sensitivity and specificity of RDTs in routine use at rural health facilities. Thick blood smears were collected for all patients tested with RDTs and stained and read by laboratory personnel in each facility. Thick smears were subsequently reviewed by a reference microscopist to determine RDT sensitivity and specificity. In all nine health facilities, there were significant problems with the quality of staining and microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of RDTs were difficult to assess given the poor quality of routine blood smear staining. Mean operational sensitivity of RDTs based on reference microscopy was 64.8%, but varied greatly by health facility, range 18.8-85.9%. Sensitivity of RDTs increased with increasing parasite density. Specificity remained high at 87.8% despite relatively poor slide quality. Institution of quality control of RDTs based on poor quality blood smear staining may impede reliable measurement of sensitivity and specificity and undermine confidence in the new diagnostic. There is an urgent need for the development of alternative quality control procedures for rapid diagnostic tests that can be performed at the facility level."
CD011431,0,20718798,0,Validation of a four-primer real-time PCR as a diagnostic tool for single and mixed Plasmodium infections.,"Although microscopy remains the reference standard for malaria diagnosis, molecular tools are attracting increasing interest. To improve the detection of mixed infections, we developed a four-primer real-time PCR with four Plasmodium species-specific forward primers, based on the pan-primer design with universal Plasmodium primers as described previously. After validation for analytical sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, the four-primer PCR was evaluated on 351 blood samples from patients presenting at the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium). With the four-primer PCR, we identified 188 Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), 54 Plasmodium vivax (Pv), 52 Plasmodium ovale (Po) and 13 Plasmodium malariae (Pm) single infections, 27 mixed infections (14 Pf + Pm; 12 Pf + Po; one Pv + Pm) and 17 negative specimens. We found lower cycle threshold values than with the pan-primer PCR, with a mean difference of 2.23, a higher analytical sensitivity (in asexual parasites/μL: Pf/Pv, 0.02; Po, 0.004; Pm, 0.006) and 15 extra mixed infections. As compared with microscopy, 17 extra mixed infections were detected and Plasmodium species were identified in four microscopy-positive samples in which species identification was not possible. Additionally, the PCR corrected 13 species mismatches between Po and Pv, and in 11 cases detected Pf as a second species that was not identified by microscopy and in five of them was not detected by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). PCR confirmed the presence of Pf in 30/46 histidine-rich protein-2-positive samples that were microscopy-negative. We conclude that the presently developed four-primer real-time PCR is complementary to standard malaria diagnostic tests in clinical laboratories, with an added value for simultaneous identification of the four Plasmodium species and the detection of mixed infections."

CD011431,0,8846490,1,ParaSight-F rapid manual diagnostic test of Plasmodium falciparum infection.,"The ParaSight(R)-F test is a qualitative diagnostic test of Plasmodium falciparum, which is based on the detection by a monoclonal antibody of a species-specific soluble antigen (histidine-rich protein (HRP-II)) in whole blood and which can be performed without special equipment. A visual reading is given by a polyclonal antibody coupled with dye-loaded liposomes; when positive, a pink line appears. The test has been compared with microscopic examination of thin blood smears and with Quantitative Buffy Coat malaria test (QBC(R) in a single-blind study. A total of 358 patients who had returned to France from malarial areas and consulted their doctor with symptoms or for a routine examination were enrolled in the study; 33 of them were found to have a falciparum malaria infection by the diagnostic test. On the day of consultation, the specificity of the ParaSight(R)-F test was 99% and its sensitivity 94%. The follow-up of infected patients after treatment showed that the test became negative later than the other reference tests. There was no correlation between antigen persistence and the intensity of the ParaSight(R)-F signal or circulating parasitaemia. No cross-reaction was noted for seven malaria cases due to other Plasmodium species. The test was performed quickly (10 tests in 20 minutes), was easy to read, and required minimal space. For cases of imported malaria, the test's specificity and low threshold for detection could make it a valuable adjunct test. However, in its present form, it cannot replace microscopic techniques which are species-specific and quantitative. In endemic areas, the test seems to be very promising by its results and ease of use according to published field studies."

However, with increasing resistance to SP, the effectiveness of SP-IPT has been questioned. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the relative efficacy of an alternative strategy of intermittent screening and treatment (IST), which involves a rapid diagnostic test for malaria at scheduled ANC visits and treatment of women only if positive, versus SP-IPT has been conducted in Ashanti region, Ghana. This paper reports on a complementary study investigating the acceptability of the different strategies to women enrolled in the trial."
CD011431,0,21161559,0,Identification of the five human Plasmodium species including P. knowlesi by real-time polymerase chain reaction.,"Recently, Plasmodium knowlesi has been recognised as the fifth Plasmodium species causing malaria in humans. Hundreds of human cases infected with this originally simian Plasmodium species have been described in Asian countries and increasing numbers are reported in Europe from travellers. The growing impact of tourism and economic development in South and Southeast Asia are expected to subsequently lead to a further increase in cases both among locals and among travellers. P. knowlesi is easily misidentified in microscopy as P. malariae or P. falciparum. We developed new primers for the rapid and specific detection of this species by low-cost real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and added this method to an already existing panel of primers used for the molecular identification of the other four species in one reaction. Reference laboratories should now be able to identify undisputably and rapidly P. knowlesi, as it is a potentially fatal pathogen."
CD011431,0,11925996,0,The increase in occurrence of typhoid fever in Cameroon: overdiagnosis due to misuse of the Widal test?,"This study investigates the cause of an apparent increase in occurrence of typhoid fever in Cameroon. The reasons explored include an overdiagnosis of the illness related to poor performance of the Widal test in laboratories and interpretation by prescribers. Questionnaires were used in 1996 to evaluate the use and interpretation of the Widal test, and checklists were used to assess its laboratory performance in 2 of the 10 provinces in Cameroon. The majority of prescribers from 20 health facilities (an average of 76% of the doctors and 61% of the nurses) could detect patients who truly had positive Widal tests and needed treatment. However, an average of 48% of the doctors and 84% of the nurses would treat patients who did not require treatment based on the Widal test result. Patients may therefore be treated unnecessarily. Most (88%) of the visited laboratories performed the Widal rapid slide agglutination test as opposed to the conventional tube agglutination test. About 14% of the laboratories that performed the rapid slide agglutination test had a score above average for each criterion evaluated. Misdiagnosis of typhoid fever leads to unnecessary expenditure and exposure of patients to the side-effects of antibiotics. In addition, misdiagnosis may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of malaria, and other acute febrile illness."

CD011431,0,22985344,0,Management of imported malaria in Europe.,"In this position paper, the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Study Group on Clinical Parasitology, summarizes main issues regarding the management of imported malaria cases. Malaria is a rare diagnosis in Europe, but it is a medical emergency. A travel history is the key to suspecting malaria and is mandatory in patients with fever. There are no specific clinical signs or symptoms of malaria although fever is seen in almost all non-immune patients. Migrants from malaria endemic areas may have few symptoms.Malaria diagnostics should be performed immediately on suspicion of malaria and the gold- standard is microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films. A Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) may be used as an initial screening tool, but does not replace urgent microscopy which should be done in parallel. Delays in microscopy, however, should not lead to delayed initiation of appropriate treatment. Patients diagnosed with malaria should usually be hospitalized. If outpatient management is preferred, as is the practice in some European centres, patients must usually be followed closely (at least daily) until clinical and parasitological cure. Treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria is either with oral artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) or with the combination atovaquone/proguanil. Two forms of ACT are available in Europe: artemether/lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine. ACT is also effective against Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi, but these species can be treated with chloroquine. Treatment of persistent liver forms in P. vivax and P. ovale with primaquine is indicated after excluding glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. There are modified schedules and drug options for the treatment of malaria in special patient groups, such as children and pregnant women. The potential for drug interactions and the role of food in the absorption of anti-malarials are important considerations in the choice of treatment.Complicated malaria is treated with intravenous artesunate resulting in a much more rapid decrease in parasite density compared to quinine. Patients treated with intravenous artesunate should be closely monitored for haemolysis for four weeks after treatment. There is a concern in some countries about the lack of artesunate produced according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)."
CD011431,0,12164291,1,Field evaluation of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv immunochromatographic test for the detection of asymptomatic malaria in a Plasmodium falciparum/vivax endemic area in Thailand.,"Rapid antigen assays provide an effective tool for the detection of malaria in symptomatic patients. However, the efficacy of these devices for detecting asymptomatic malaria, where parasite levels are normally significantly lower than in symptomatic patients, is less well established. We evaluated the efficacy of a new combined Plasmodium falciparum-Plasmodim vivax immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria Pf/Pv) in a cross-sectional malaria survey of the village of Ban Kong Mong Tha, Kanchanaburi Provice, Thailand, from August to December 2000. A total of 1,976 bleeds were made from 559 individuals over the course of the study. Blinded microscopy of thick and thin blood films was used as the gold standard; all discordant and 10% of concordant results were cross-checked. Of 1,976 ICT Malaria Pf/Pv dipsticks tested, 98.3% (n = 1,943) performed as expected, as evidenced by the appearance of the control line. The ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test was both sensitive (100.0%) and specific (99.7 %) for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria with parasitemias of > or = 500 trophozoites/microL; however, only 15.9% (13/82) of infected individuals had parasitemia rates this high. When P. falciparum parasitemia rates were < 500/microL, the sensitivity of the diagnosis was only 23.3%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.2 and 97.2%, respectively. The ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test was specific, but not sensitive, for the diagnosis of vivax malaria with parasite rates of > or = 500 trophozoites/microl, with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 66.7%, 99.9%, 66.7%, and 99.9%, respectively. At parasite rates of < 500/microL, corresponding values were 0.0%, 99.9%, 0%, and 95.1%. Because of the relatively high cost of these assays, low parasite rates found in the majority of asymptomatic individuals, and low sensitivity of this assay with rates of < 500/microl, use of this assay as a tool for active case detection is of limited value in western Thailand."
CD011431,0,11280055,0,Malaria in the highlands of Madagascar after five years of indoor house spraying of DDT.,"The central region of Madagascar is a vast area of highlands (altitude 700-2000 m). Malaria transmission has re-established itself here since the last epidemic of 1985-90 and has caused the deaths of 40,000 persons according to the Minister of Health. To combat the main malaria vector in the region, Anopheles funestus, annual programmes of indoor house spraying of DDT were carried out between December 1993 and January 1998 in most rural areas at altitude 1000-1500 m. A parasitological and serological study was then conducted in the highland schools to evaluate the impact of the programme and set up a database on the region. Using a cluster-sampling method 2 independent selections were conducted (one of 130 sites, the other of 40 sites). During the study, 13,462 schoolchildren were examined, 71% living in sprayed villages. Parasite prevalence among schoolchildren declined as altitude increases, from 11% at 700-900 m to 0.4% at > 1500 m. Below 1500 m, the impact of the spraying on the prevalence of the parasite was very clear (an average decrease of from 20% to 2.7% below 1000 m and of from 4.5% without spraying to 0.8% at 1000-1500 m). Geographical analysis of the data showed that the marginal regions remained the most affected by malaria (especially outside spraying zones), and persistence of 'pockets of transmission' at 1000-1500 m, essentially in areas where spraying has never been used. In 9 schools, anti-Plasmodium antibodies were sought by indirect immunofluorescence on thick smears of parasitized red blood cells. The seroprevalence ranged from 22% to 63%, which suggests that the parasite is still circulating in the region. Even though our data show that vector control continues to be very successful in the Madagascan highlands, rapid reinfection could occur and must be monitored following spraying. To this end, the Minister for Health, with the support of the Italian Co-operation, has placed the region under epidemiological surveillance since 1997. An alert system for the timely detection of the sources of epidemics and the targeting of the antivectoral campaign is also in operation. Our study suggests that this strategy should be reinforced by the spraying of DDT in the marginal zones in order to consolidate the results obtained at higher altitudes."

CD011431,0,21880972,1,Prevalence and density-related concordance of three diagnostic tests for malaria in a region of Tanzania with hypoendemic malaria.,"Accurate malaria diagnosis has dual roles in identification of symptomatic persons for effective malaria treatment and also enumeration of asymptomatic persons who contribute to the epidemiologic determinants of transmission. Three currently used diagnostic tests, microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and real-time PCR, all have different sensitivities and specificities, which are parasite density dependent. Here, we compare their concordance among 451 febrile episodes in a cohort of 2,058 children and adults followed over 6 months in a region in central Tanzania with hypoendemic malaria. Microscopy, a histidine-rich protein-based RDT, and two different real-time PCR gene probes detected Plasmodium falciparum in 20, 54, 41, and 78 episodes of fever, respectively. They had complete concordance in only 9 episodes. Real-time PCR with an 18S probe was more sensitive than with a mitochondrial probe for cytochrome b despite higher copy numbers of mitochondrial DNA. Both PCR yields were increased 4-fold by glycogen/acetate precipitation with low-speed centrifugation. Duplicate PCR increases low-density malaria detection. RDT had the highest number of unique positives, presumably from persistent antigen despite the absence of parasites, although RDT did not detect 3 parasitemias with over 1,000 parasites/μl. In a latent class analysis, real-time PCR had significantly higher sensitivity than did microscopy or RDT. Agreement between real-time PCR, RDT, and microscopy was highest in March and April, when both the P. falciparum parasite rate and parasite densities are highest. Real-time PCR is more sensitive and specific than RDT and microscopy in low-prevalence, low-parasite-density settings."

CD011431,0,19346368,0,Unified parasite lactate dehydrogenase and histidine-rich protein ELISA for quantification of Plasmodium falciparum.,"There is a need for more objective and quantitative tools to replace microscopy in malaria diagnosis. Emphasis has recently been placed on alternative methods such as immunochromatography-based rapid tests. However, these tests provide only qualitative results. Two bio-molecules, parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and histidine-rich proteins (HRPs), that are released by the intra-erythrocytic stages of the parasite offer certain specific characteristics that could potentially improve malaria diagnosis. In this paper, we describe a protocol for a unified sandwich ELISA that allows for the separate but concurrent measurement of pLDH and HRP biomolecules in aliquots taken from the same samples. Freshly drawn blood from a healthy unexposed adult male was used to serially dilute in vitro cultivated and synchronized ring stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Commercially available ELISA formats were modified to allow for the measurement of pLDH and HRP from aliquots of the same samples. The pLDH and HRP levels in the samples spiked with known numbers of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) were measured, and the values were used to generate standard graphs. The standard graphs were used to estimate the numbers of iRBCs in test samples. Serially diluted recombinant proteins were similarly used to generate a calibration curve, allowing for the expression of test results in nanograms of their respective recombinant protein. Levels of pLDH and HRPs were determined by using 1) P. falciparum culture material (cells and medium) 2) P. falciparum infected human blood (N = 6) samples, and 3) plasma from P. falciparum-infected patient (N = 22) samples. The parasite density of all culture and infected patient samples was also estimated by microscopy. Both pLDH and HRP levels correlated positively with the parasite density assessed by microscopy: Pearson correlation coefficient pLDH (r = 0.754, P < 0.0001, 95% CI: 0.47-0.89); HRP (r = 0.552, P < 0.007, 95% CI: 0.16-0.79). The HRPs seem to be released in larger quantities than pLDH (in a ratio of ~1 pLDH:~6 HRP), making the detection of HRP in culture material, blood, and plasma easier. The modified ELISA assay with quantitative measurement of pLDH and HRPs may provide a valuable tool for malaria research and patient management."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common form of diabetes (90-95%), exhibiting an alarming prevalence among peoples of this region. Its main risk factors include obesity, rapid urbanization, physical inactivity, ageing, nutrition transitions, and socioeconomic changes. Patients in sub-Saharan Africa also show manifestations of beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. However, because of strained economic resources and a poor health care system, most of the patients are diagnosed only after they have overt symptoms and complications. Microvascular complications are the most prevalent, but metabolic disorders and acute infections cause significant mortality. The high cost of treatment of T2DM and its comorbidities, the increasing prevalence of its risk factors, and the gaps in health care system necessitate that solutions be planned and implemented urgently. Aggressive actions and positive responses from well-informed governments appear to be needed for the conducive interplay of all forces required to curb the threat of T2DM in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the varied ethnic and transitional factors and the limited population data on T2DM in sub-Saharan Africa, this review provides an extensive discussion of the literature on the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, complications, treatment, and care challenges of T2DM in this region."

The potential causes of fever in travelers are extensive. This article provides practical clues to assist the physician in making the correct diagnosis--by using exposure information, symptoms and signs, and concomitant symptom complexes."

CD011431,0,12454171,1,Comparison of two commercial assays with expert microscopy for confirmation of symptomatically diagnosed malaria.,"Conventional light microscopy has been the established method for malaria diagnosis. However, recently several nonmicroscopic rapid diagnostic tests have been developed for situations in which reliable microscopy may not be available. This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a recently introduced ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test. This assay detects Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 antigen (PfHRP-2) for P. falciparum diagnosis and pan-malarial antigen for P. vivax diagnosis. In this study we compared the performance of ICT Malaria Pf/Pv with microscopy of Giemsa-stained blood films and with an OptiMAL test that detects Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigen. A total of 750 clinically suspected malaria patients were examined at local health centers in Kuwait. Both the antigen tests had a high degree of specificity (>98%) for detection of malaria infection. However, they were less sensitive than microscopy. Compared with microscopy the ICT Malaria PF/pf test failed to detect malaria infection in 93 (34%) of 271 malaria patients (11% of patients with P. falciparum and 37% of patients with P. vivax) and the OptiMAL test failed to detect malaria infection in 41 (15%) of 271 malaria patients (7% of patients with P. falciparum and 13% of patients with P. vivax). The sensitivities of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv and OptiMAL tests for detection of P. falciparum infection were 81 and 87%, and those for detecting P. vivax were 58 to 79%, respectively. The sensitivity of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv and OptiMAL tests decreased significantly to 23 and 44%, respectively, at parasite densities of <500/ micro l. Both of the tests also produced a number of false-positive results. Overall, the performance of the OptiMAL test was better than that of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test. However, our results raise particular concern over the sensitivity of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test for detection of P. vivax infection. Further developments appear necessary to improve the performance of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test."

CD011431,0,18800620,0,[Identification of four species of human malaria parasites by fast PCR].,"Malaria is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. Accurate identification of four species of human malaria parasite is essential for appropriate treatment. Here, we developed a simple and rapid method of identifying Plasmodium species using a fast polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Based on the previous literature, we amplified small subunit ribosomal RNA genes of four human malaria parasites. To establish a minimum detection limit, a blood sample with a known number of P. falciparum parasites (parasitemia: 3%) was diluted serially(from 0.03% to 0.000003%). We compared the detection limits between single (one-step) PCR and nested (two-step) PCR. Other clinical blood samples, which were infected with P. falciparum (parasitemia: 2.8%), P. vivax (parasitemia: 0.13%), P. ovale (parasitemia: 0.04%), respectively, were also tested by our PCR system. The PCR findings were compared to those of blood film Giemsa staining and rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). The sensitivity of our method is less than one parasite in 1 microl of blood(estimated parasitemia: 0.000003%) for both single PCR and nested PCR, though an increased number of cycles (40 cycles) was required for single PCR. Using clinical samples, it was proven that amplified products by single PCR could clearly distinguish between P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale. To detect P. vivax and P. ovale, the PCR system was more sensitive than RDT. The total required time for our method was within three to four hours from DNA extraction to PCR detection. Taken together, our method is easier and faster than the previously reported PCR-based malaria parasite identification systems, and is also useful for cases in which diagnosis by Giemsa staining and RDT is difficult."

However, research on their diagnostic accuracy during pregnancy is limited. Pregnant women (n = 418) were screened for malaria during routine antenatal care by using two RDTs that detect histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) or Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with antibodies that detect dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase or heme-detoxification protein, and compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and microscopy for evaluation of their diagnostic accuracy. Prevalence of malaria infection was high (53% by PCR). The RT-PCR and the HRP2 RDT detected most cases of malaria during pregnancy, whereas microscopy, the Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase RDT, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase and heme-detoxification protein antibodies did not detect several low-density infections. Therefore, the HRP2 RDT could be a useful tool in high-transmission areas for diagnosis of malaria in asymptomatic pregnant women."

CD011431,0,20486352,0,[Obstacles to laboratory diagnosis of malaria in Mali--perspectives].,"Rapid accurate laboratory diagnosis is necessary for effective malaria management. In Mali, meeting this prerequisite is impeded by underuse of laboratory diagnosis by clinicians, absence of qualified laboratory facilities in some locations, and poor continuous professional education of laboratory technicians. The twofold aim of this investigation was to perform quality control of thick smear readings made by laboratory technicians in 1998 and 1999 and to study the feasibility and diagnostic value of two rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), i.e., ParaSight and OptiMAL, in comparison with the thick smear technique in the period from 1998 to 2003. Quality control of thick smear readings indicated a 56% false positive rate with 49.3% concordance between laboratory technician readings and the reference centre. Trials using RDT showed that the OptiMAL test was more efficient with 97.2% sensibility, 95.4% specificity and 93% concordance in comparison with thick smear. A program of training, refresher courses, and regular didactic supervision (quality control) for laboratory technicians has been set up in Mali under the sponsorship of the ""Fondation Mérieux"" (ACTION BIOMALI) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). These institutions provide funding for training as well as equipment and consumables in all public medical laboratories in Mali.

RDT use by volunteer community health workers (CHWs) is one alternative, but most sub-Saharan African countries prohibit CHWs from handling blood, and little is known about CHW ability to use RDTs safely and effectively. This Zambia-based study was designed to determine: (i) whether Zambian CHWs could prepare and interpret RDTs accurately and safely using manufacturer's instructions alone; (ii) whether simple, mostly pictorial instructions (a ""job aid"") could raise performance to adequate levels; and (iii) whether a brief training programme would produce further improvement."

The increasing demand to reduce the turnaround time of test results, coupled with rapid improvements in technology, have led to the development of several devices that are designed for use in different clinical settings, with the hope of improving patient care. The most used POCT in haematology is measurement of haemoglobin concentration. Other POCT devices (used primarily in developing countries) for malaria screening and CD4+ T-lymphocytes for quantification of human-immunodeficiency-virus are becoming the cornerstone for the diagnosis and management of these disorders. New devices are also available for red cell indices, white blood cell count and platelets. In this review clinical studies that validate the use of such devices will be discussed, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of POCT in haematology. A disadvantage of POCT is a lack of training, poor standardization in obtaining blood samples and insufficient internal/external quality assessment. As there is every reason to expect that POCT use will increase in all pathology disciplines, including haematology, it is imperative that systems are put in place to oversee these issues."

We evaluated whether berberine can be used for staining of malarial parasites in 40 selected peripheral blood smears from patients with clinical symptoms of malaria; smears were evaluated with OptiMal (DiaMed, Miami, FL) and Giemsa stain. Twenty were positive with both OptiMal and Giemsa (Plasmodium vivax, 14; Plasmodium falciparum, 6); 10 were negative with both. The remainder were positive by OptiMal but negative by Giemsa and, therefore, were classified as equivocal. All slides were processed simultaneously, stained with berberine, and read under a fluorescent microscope. P vivax and P falciparum DNA fluoresced with berberine. The positives and negatives by berberine concurred with the Giemsa staining. Of the 10 equivocal smears, 5 were confirmed positive by berberine. Gametocytes were easily identifiable. This test has high sensitivity and high positive predictive value and, once standardized, can be used as a potential screening and diagnostic tool."

The FTS and a more classical thick-smear method (CTS) were both used on each of 1185 samples of venous blood samples from 1034 cases of suspected malaria (all international travellers returning to France). The results indicated that there was no statistically significant differences between the two methods in terms of their sensitivity, specificity or predictive values for parasite detection. However, estimates of the intensities of the Plasmodium falciparum infections observed, based on counts of trophozoites against 200 leucocytes, were markedly higher (37.8% higher overall) with the FTS than with the CTS (P < 0.0001).

In a recent study in Thailand, we identified amplification of the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1) as being the most important predictor of in vitro drug resistance and in vivo failure of mefloquine monotherapy. Here we report amplification of pfmdr1 in >5% of patient samples from Lambarene, Gabon, collected in 1995. None of the samples collected 7 years later showed pfmdr1 amplification, suggesting that parasites with increased numbers of pfmdr1 copies have not substantially spread through the population. Nevertheless, the detection of multicopy pfmdr1 in African parasites suggests a high potential for rapid selection for resistance, implying that mefloquine use in Africa should be considered only as part of combination therapy."

Method A employs a single extraction step and internal standardization to permit rapid, precise analyses for chloroquine in whole blood. Method B, employing derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride, can then be applied to the extract to allow qualitative and quantitative confirmation of chloroquine and sensitive, precise quantification for desethylchloroquine. The detection limit for chloroquine in blood is 5 ng/ml by both methods; the limit for desethylchloroquine is 15 ng/ml. Excellent precision is achieved by the methodology, partly due to the use of separate internal standards for the two analytes, each internal standard being a close analogue of the corresponding analyte. Data are presented which demonstrate the increase over time of metabolite relative to unchanged chloroquine found in the blood of a volunteer undergoing a chemoprophylactic regimen of chloroquine."

A Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP-2)-based assay (ICT malaria Pf assay) was evaluated for its performance and compared to that of Giemsa-stained thick blood film microscopy. Of the 515 patients tested, 163 were positive for malaria parasites on thick blood film microscopy: 87 were infected with P. vivax; 63 with P. falciparum; 1 with P. malariae; and 12 with both P. falciparum and P. vivax. The ICT assay detected 53 P. falciparum infections and, as expected, failed to detect all but one case of P. vivax. Three cases of mixed infections were also not detected by this assay. The performance of the ICT assay in diagnosing P. falciparum infection was comparable to that of microscopy. The sensitivity of the ICT assay was 82% and the specificity 99.0%. The ICT assay also detected 4 false-positive cases. These patients reported treatment with chloroquine in the previous 2-5 weeks. The specificity of the assay was evaluated in different groups of patients, who had tested negative for malaria infection by microscopy. These patients were selected from different disease groups: rheumatoid arthritis; hepatitis C; toxoplasmosis; schistosomiasis; and hydatid disease. Of the 225 patients studied, 133 were positive for rheumatoid factor. Thirty-five (26%) of the 133 patients had false positive-reactions with the ICT assay, while only four had false positive-reactions with the OptiMAL test. After the rheumatoid factor was absorbed 33 of the 35 false-positive specimens were negative when retested with the ICT assay. Our study shows that the PfHRP-2-based ICT assay gave a false positive-reaction in 26% of the patients who had rheumatoid factors, but were negative for malaria by microscopy. We conclude that new rapid nonmicroscopic methods for the diagnosis of malaria that complement or support blood film microscopy would be of great use in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with malaria and also in epidemiological studies."

An Enhanced Malaria Control Project (EMCP) under financial assistance from Bank was implemented in selected tribal states and districts from 1997 to 2005. While most of the project districts did report a decline in malaria incidence, the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) highlighted the need for major reform. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria, which accounts for almost all malaria related mortality, has been increasing in India and there is widespread resistance to chloroquine. The needed reform would require, first and foremost, updating of policy on malaria case management in public and private sectors. Also needed are innovative approaches for promoting the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and strengthening institutions at the district and state levels for effective implementation of new policies. Several important changes in the policy on diagnosis and treatment of malaria are being implemented in this new project. The most important of these are: Use of artesunate combination therapy (ACT) as the first line treatment for all confirmed Pf malaria cases, introduction of rapid diagnostic kits for quick diagnosis of Pf cases, promotion of long lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs) in vulnerable population. Supervision and monitoring will be strengthened by deployment of Malarial/Kala azar Technical Supervisors (MTS/KTS) and VBD consultants at district level. The project has also envisaged two important components like Environment Management Plan (EMP) for safe use of insecticides and materials and Vulnerable Community Plan (VCP) for the benefit of underprivileged population."

Two Plasmodium falciparum testing systems, namely MalaQuick (ICT) and ParaSight F were used. Test performance and test interpretation of pre-prepared tests were compared. There was no significant difference in test performance between the 2 tests. Interpretation of prepared test strips in both test systems was very reliable in blood parasite densities between 0.1% and 2%, but major problems were encountered at low parasitaemia (< 0.1% blood parasites) and also in ParaSight F test strips showing high parasitaemia (> 2% blood parasites). Low parasitaemia ParaSight F test strips were correctly interpreted by 52.1% compared with 10.8% correct interpretations with MalaQuick (P < 0.0001). Correct interpretation of highly positive (> 2% blood parasites) pre-prepared test strips was higher with MalaQuick (96.8%) than with ParaSight F (33.8%), P < 0.0001. Both tests were associated with high levels of false-negative interpretations which render them unsuitable as self-diagnostic kits. Efforts must be made to assist lay individuals in test performance by technical test improvement, by equiping the test strips with an additional reading aid for interpretation, and by providing instruction by a skilled person."

In Nepal, thick and thin blood smears remain the gold standard for malaria species diagnosis in routine diagnostic laboratories. In this study the efficacy of newer malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) surpassed the diagnostic efficacy of clinical microscopy and hence these RDT's will have a greater role in clinical practice.

The thick blood films of 60 samples were later re-read by a local reference laboratory. Of these 98.3% were in agreement with the reading performed at the hospital. Only one of the 60 slides differed. The rapid dipstick test proved to be both easy to use and free from many of the usual constraints such as a need for formally trained or experienced laboratory staff, laboratory equipment, and reliable water and electricity supplies.

The method - direct laser desorption mass spectrometry - is based on the detection of heme (iron protoporphyrin) as a unique qualitative and quantitative molecular biomarker for malaria. In infected erythrocytes, the parasite sequesters heme in a molecular crystal (hemozoin) - a volume of highly concentrated and purified biomarker molecules. Laser desorption mass spectrometry detects only heme from hemozoin in parasite-infected blood, and not heme that is bound to hemoglobin or other proteins in uninfected blood samples. The method requires only a drop of blood with minimal sample preparation. Laser desorption mass spectrometry may become a rapid and high-throughput tool for specific and sensitive pan-malaria detection at levels below 10 parasites/mul of blood."

Twelve (1.3%) RDT results were positive and 28 (3.1%) were indeterminate. Microscopy confirmed Plasmodium species in two of the positive RDT and one of the indeterminate results. Among a random 10% sample of negative RDT results (n = 86), none were positive by microscopy. The PCR confirmed the two microscopically (and RDT) positive specimens. The PCR result was negative for all other specimens tested. Eighteen (2.0%) refugees were treated with antimalarials. The RDTs were useful in this setting, facilitating timely, sensitive diagnosis and targeted treatment. Evaluations to determine the most appropriate interventions in other refugee settings should include cost-effectiveness analyses of alternative strategies."
CD011431,0,18165484,0,The cost-effectiveness of parasitologic diagnosis for malaria-suspected patients in an era of combination therapy.,"The introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy in sub-Saharan Africa has prompted calls for increased use of parasitologic diagnosis for malaria. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in comparison to microscopy in guiding treatment of non-severe febrile illness at varying levels of malaria endemicity using data on test accuracy and costs collected as part of a Tanzanian trial. If prescribers complied with current guidelines, microscopy would give rise to lower average costs per patient correctly treated than RDTs in areas of both high and low transmission. RDT introduction would result in an additional 2.3% and 9.4% of patients correctly treated, at an incremental cost of $25 and $7 in the low and high transmission settings, respectively. Cost-effectiveness would be worse if prescribers do not comply with test results. The cost of this additional benefit may be higher than many countries can afford without external assistance or lower RDT prices."
CD011431,0,16172468,0,Detection of Plasmodium falciparum in pregnancy by laser desorption mass spectrometry.,"Detection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria during pregnancy is complicated by sequestration of parasites in the placenta, which reduces peripheral blood microscopic detection. Laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) has previously demonstrated sensitive detection of hemozoin from P. falciparum blood cultures and the ability to track parasitemia in a Plasmodium yoelii malaria mouse model. Here we use a simple, dilution in water, blood sample preparation protocol for LDMS detection of malaria in 45 asymptomatic, pregnant Zambian women. We compare LDMS to microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. All women were microscopy negative. LDMS detected P. falciparum hemozoin in 15 out of 45 women, while PCR results were positive in 25 women. Compared with PCR, which analyzed 20-30 microL of blood, the sensitivity of LDMS, which analyzed < 1 microL of blood, was 52%, with a specificity of 92%. LDMS is a potentially rapid and more sensitive alternate diagnostic method than microscopy."

We have evaluated the utility of ICT for providing semi-quantitative estimates of parasite load. Circulating parasite load in the blood of patients with malaria (n =54), were compared with the circulating HRP2 protein levels. Blood was serially diluted and analysed by a rapid diagnostic test (ICT(R) Now P.f/P.v) for assessment of endpoint PfHRP2 antigen titres. Significant correlation was observed between parasite load and PfHRP2 antigen titres (Spearman rank; rho = 0.821; p<0.001) with plasma dilutions > 1:16 corresponding to a parasite load of 0.1% parasitaemia. Variability in haematological parameters had no effect on the antibody titres obtained with the ICT test. Rapid semi-quantitative assessment of parasite load in conjunction with the Plasmodium speciation may provide a useful bedside and field aid in the diagnosis of malaria."

Among the 11 previous cases of vivax-related severe respiratory involvement described in the literature, all except one developed it after the beginning of anti-malarial treatment; these appear to correspond to an exacerbation of the inflammatory response. We report the case of a 43-year-old Brazilian woman living in a malaria-endemic area, who presented acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by P. vivax before starting anti-malarial treatment. The diagnosis was made based on microscopic methods. A negative rapid immunochromatographic assay, based on the detection of Histidine Rich Protein-2 (HRP-2) of P. falciparum, indicated that falciparum malaria was unlikely. After specific anti-plasmodial therapy and intensive supportive care, the patient was discharged from the hospital.

However, difficulty in maintaining required technical skills and infrastructure has spurred the development of several nonmicroscopic malaria rapid diagnostic devices based on the detection of malaria parasite antigen in whole blood. The ParaSight F test is one such device. It detects the presence of Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein 2 by using an antigen-capture immunochromatographic strip format. The present study was conducted at outpatient malaria clinics in Iquitos, Peru, and Maesod, Thailand. Duplicate, blinded, expert microscopy was employed as the reference standard for evaluating device performance. Of 2,988 eligible patients, microscopy showed that 547 (18%) had P. falciparum, 658 (22%) had P. vivax, 2 (0.07%) had P. malariae, and 1,750 (59%) were negative for Plasmodium. Mixed infections (P. falciparum and P. vivax) were identified in 31 patients (1%). The overall sensitivity of ParaSight F for P. falciparum was 95%. When stratified by magnitude of parasitemia (no. of asexual parasites per microliter of whole blood), sensitivities were 83% (>0 to 500 parasites/microl), 87% (501 to 1,000/microl), 98% (1,001 to 5,000/microl), and 98% (>5,000/microl).

We need reliable diagnostic tools with negative likelihood ratio (LR-) close to zero (-> high negative predictive value). Ideally, a microscopical examination (ME) (thick and thin film) should be done, with or without a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). When the ME is not immediately available, an RDT can be done in the practice office and the ME delayed for 6-12 hours, provided there is no danger sign or thrombopenia. Indeed, the LR- of RDT being of 0.08 (estimated in a meta-analysis of RDT in non-immune travelers), the probability of falciparum malaria is 1% after a negative RDT.

CD011431,0,21292291,0,"Epidemic of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Central India, an area where chloroquine has been replaced by artemisinin-based combination therapy.","India contributes greatly to the global incidence of malaria. The factors influencing malaria in India are highly diverse and vary greatly from the epidemiological setting of any other country. Central India is the most vulnerable area to malaria in India. This study was carried out in three community health centres in Dindori District, Madhya Pradesh (Central India). Dindori District is mesoendemic for malaria, with both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax being present in all age groups. Anopheles culicifacies and A. fluviatilis are highly efficient vectors of malaria. In this study, an epidemic of malaria among indigenous ethnic group Baigas was investigated to determine the causes of the epidemic and the population involved in order to aid in disease containment. The existence of sporozoite-positive A. culicifacies and A. fluviatilis indicates either that spraying had not been done properly or the presence of insecticide resistance. A combination of factors propagated the epidemic. Evidence suggests that the non-availability of artemisinin-based combination therapy and rapid diagnostic tests along with an immunogenically vulnerable population each played an important role. As the global prevalence of malaria decreases owing to initiatives to control or eliminate the disease, more areas will become mesoendemic or hypoendemic for malaria. Detection and control of epidemics requires greater attention, and mechanisms to ensure the quality of interventions are essential."

The number of cases in non-endemic countries continues to increase, and it is important that misdiagnosis of malaria should not occur, especially in non-immune travellers, because of the high risk of a fatal outcome. In a retrospective study of 399 sera, the Now Malaria rapid test was compared with the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) test and microbiological examination of thin blood films. Compared with the QBC test and thin blood films, the Now Malaria test had sensitivity and specificity values of 96.4% and 97%, respectively, for the detection of pure P. falciparum infection. A negative predictive value of 99.4% allows this test to be included in diagnostic strategies for patients presenting with clinical suspicion of malaria. Two false-negative results were associated with low levels of parasitaemia in the specimens. Thus, use of the Now Malaria test alone to detect P. falciparum infection in non-endemic countries could lead to misdiagnosis of malaria. This rapid diagnostic test should therefore be performed in association with another prompt traditional method such as examination of thin blood films."

Thick blood smear was used as the reference technique for comparison. Testing was conducted on persons between the ages of 6 months and 70 years at two hospitals from June to October 2010. If malaria was suspected in the sample by the nurse based on clinical findings and sent to laboratory for confirmation, one thick smear, one rapid diagnostic test and one slide for the fluorescent microscopy were performed. All tests were read in hospital laboratories involved with the quality control of thick blood smear in the parasitology laboratory of National University Hospital of Cotonou.

CD011431,0,9431947,1,Evaluation of the OptiMAL test for rapid diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria.,"The development of rapid and specific diagnostic tests to identify individuals infected with malaria is of paramount importance in efforts to control the severe public health impact of this disease. This study evaluated the ability of a newly developed rapid malaria diagnostic test, OptiMAL (Flow Inc., Portland, Oreg.), to detect Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria during an outbreak in Honduras. OptiMAL is a rapid (10-min) malaria detection test which utilizes a dipstick coated with monoclonal antibodies against the intracellular metabolic enzyme parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). Differentiation of malaria parasites is based on antigenic differences between the pLDH isoforms. Since pLDH is produced only by live Plasmodium parasites, this test has the ability to differentiate live from dead organisms. Results from the OptiMAL test were compared to those obtained by reading 100 fields of traditional Giemsa-stained thick-smear blood films. Whole-blood samples were obtained from 202 patients suspected of having malaria. A total of 96 samples (48%) were positive by blood films, while 91 (45%) were positive by the OptiMAL test. The blood films indicated that 82% (79 of 96) of the patients were positive for P. vivax and 18% (17 of 96) were infected with P. falciparum. The OptiMAL test showed that 81% (74 of 91) were positive for P. vivax and 19% (17 of 91) were positive for P. falciparum. These results demonstrated that the OptiMAL test had sensitivities of 94 and 88% and specificities of 100 and 99%, respectively, when compared to traditional blood films for the detection of P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria. Blood samples not identified by OptiMAL as malaria positive normally contained parasites at concentrations of less than 100/microl of blood. Samples found to contain P. falciparum were further tested by two other commercially available rapid malaria diagnostic tests, ParaSight-F (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) and ICT Malaria P.f. (ICT Diagnostics, Sydney, Australia), both of which detect only P. falciparum. Only 11 of the 17 (65%) P. falciparum-positive blood samples were identified by the ICT and ParaSight-F tests. Thus, OptiMAL correctly identified P. falciparum malaria parasites in patient blood samples more often than did the other two commercially available diagnostic tests and showed an excellent correlation with traditional blood films in the identification of both P. vivax malaria and P. falciparum malaria. We conclude that the OptiMAL test is an effective tool for the rapid diagnosis of malaria."

The HRP-2 test showed very high sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (94.1%) for Plasmodiumfalciparum parasitaemia and none or very low sensitivity and specificity for other malaria species. The HRP-2 test detected both asexual and sexual stages of the Plasmodium falciparum parasites. The test did not show significant changes in detection of different levels of parasitaemia. These findings enable to conclude that the HRP-2 immunochromatographic assay can be very helpful to diagnose Plasmodium falciparum malaria when microscopy examination is not available, but as qualitative tests can be difficult for interpretation especially in high malaria risk areas. Therefore it can require re-examination of blood with microscopy to confirm species and development stages of Plasmodium spp. and to assess parasite load."

In developing nations, scarce resources lead to inadequate diagnostic procedures. Microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin films remains the current gold standard for diagnosis. Although it has good sensitivity and allows species identification, it is time consuming, requires microscopical expertise and maintenance of equipment. Antigen tests are promising tools for the diagnosis of malaria. Two such antigens are Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein (pfHRP-2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The present study was aimed to develop indigenous, rapid and sensitive immunodiagnostic method based on detection of PfHRP-2 and LDH antigen in the blood. Unique peptide sequences of PfHRP-2 (two regions) and LDH (three regions) antigen were synthesized by solid phase technique and purified to homogeneity. The antibodies raised against these sequences were raised in mice as well as rabbit using microspheres (PLGA) to generate high titre and affinity antibodies. The peptide-specific peak titres varied from 25,000 to 50,000 and affinity of the antibodies produced was found to be in order of 0.73-5.3 nM. The antibodies generated using microspheres were able to detect the PfHRP-2 and LDH antigen in the culture supernatant and parasitized RBC lysate of P. falciparum respectively by sandwich ELISA up to 0.002% parasitaemia level.

First- and second-line treatments adopted by caretakers, when either they or their children were sick, involved considerable self-medication with chloroquine and paracetamol. Ethnographic data were supplemented and tested for generalizability through a cross-sectional survey, and the paper discusses this methodological approach."

Sample preparation involved protein precipitation, followed by a solid-phase clean-up and a liquid-liquid extraction. Chromatographic separation was carried out on an Ultrasphere C8 column (25 cm x 4.6 mm I.D., 5 microns particle size) using a mobile phase of acetonitrile:water, 75:25, (vol/vol), with 0.2% (w/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.2% (vol/vol) glacial acetic acid. The serum sample volume used was 0.5 ml, with concentrations normalized to 1 ml. Retention times for BHAL, HAL, and the internal standard were 5.5, 8.3, and 11.5 min, respectively, with a total run time of 13.5 min. The average extraction recovery for HAL was 85.6% and 100.5% for BHAL. Inter- and intra-assay precisions of HAL and BHAL were less than or equal to 7.5%, with an accuracy of less than or equal to 10.8% over three concentrations (0.02, 0.5, 2.0 micrograms/ml). Detection limits of HAL and BHAL were 5 and 3 ng/ml, respectively. The new HPLC method resulted in cleaner chromatograms and a 1.7-fold faster run time than previous HPLC methods. Application of the method with clinical specimens was demonstrated."
CD011431,0,15728862,1,Usefulness of a rapid on-site Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis (Paracheck PF) in forest migrants and among the indigenous population at the site of their occupational activities in central India.,"Logistic, economic, and technical factors limit rapid access to microscopic confirmation of malaria in many tropical countries, including India. The occurrence of high-grade fever and three deaths during the hot summer months in some forest migrants created an emergency situation in Jabalpur in central India. A cheap and rapid malaria test, Paracheck Pf, was tested in this group of migrants in parallel with microscopy. The indigenous population at the site of occupational activities of these migrants approximately 250 km from Jabalpur was also screened by both methods. The results of this field investigation are very encouraging. Among migrants, the test had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 67%. The positive and negative predictive values were 94% and 100%, respectively. Among indigenous population, the corresponding values were 100%, 97.3%, 98.4%, and 100%, respectively, indicating the usefulness of test as a diagnostic tool for providing on-site confirmation of symptomatic diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria."

CD011431,0,23782675,0,Reducing transfusion-associated malaria in Pakistan: an algorithmic approach.,"Blood transfusions represent a small but significant source of malaria transmission. Most blood banks rely solely on donor questioning to exclude malaria patients from donating blood. No guidelines exist for in vitro screening of donor blood for malaria in endemic areas. Possible laboratory screening techniques include: microscopy; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody testing; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing; and rapid diagnostic antigen tests. However, all these modalities have diagnostic limitations. Based on a best evidence review, we present recommendations using an algorithmic approach to blood screening for malaria in Pakistan. This algorithm considers regional endemicity for malaria, as well as a detailed donor history, in order to decide whether donor blood should be tested with rapid antigen testing. We hope this algorithm will assist in the development of future national guidelines for screening blood for malaria that will reduce the risk of blood-borne transmission."

CD011431,0,24048274,0,Malaria rapid diagnostic tests: challenges and prospects.,"In the last decade, there has been an upsurge of interest in developing malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits for the detection of Plasmodium species. Three antigens - Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), plasmodial aldolase and plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) - are currently used for RDTs. Tests targeting HRP2 contribute to more than 90% of the malaria RDTs in current use. However, the specificities, sensitivities, numbers of false positives, numbers of false negatives and temperature tolerances of these tests vary considerably, illustrating the difficulties and challenges facing current RDTs. This paper describes recent developments in malaria RDTs, reviewing RDTs detecting PfHRP2, pLDH and plasmodial aldolase. The difficulties associated with RDTs, such as genetic variability in the Pfhrp2 gene and the persistence of antigens in the bloodstream following the elimination of parasites, are discussed. The prospect of overcoming the problems associated with current RDTs with a new generation of alternative malaria antigen targets is also described."
CD011431,0,15584018,0,Detection of a Plasmodium vivax erythrocyte binding protein by flow cytometry.,The malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax preferentially invades reticulocytes. It is therefore relevant for vaccine development purposes to identify and characterize P. vivax proteins that bind specifically to the surface of reticulocytes. We have developed a two-color flow cytometric erythrocyte binding assay (F-EBA) that has several advantages over traditional erythrocyte binding assays (T-EBAs) used in malaria research. We demonstrate the use of F-EBA using the P. vivax Duffy binding protein region II (PvDBP-RII) recombinant protein as a model. This protein binds to all erythrocytes that express the Duffy receptor (Fy) and discriminates binding between normocytes and reticulocytes.

CD011431,0,22205350,0,Unusual presentation of Plasmodium vivax: a neglected human malaria parasite.,"Severe and complicated malaria is usually caused by Plasmodium falciparum malaria (PF) but it has been increasingly observed that Plasmodium vivax malaria (PV), which was otherwise considered to be benign malaria, with a low case-fatality ratio, can also occasionally result in severe disease as with PF malaria. There is an urgent need to re-examine the clinical spectrum and burden of PV so that adequate control measures can be implemented against this emerging but neglected disease. We report a case of severe PV malaria with multi-organ dysfunction. Patients exhibited acute kidney injury, severe anemia/thrombocytopenia, jaundice, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and pulmonary edema. Peripheral blood microscopy by trained and expert pathologist and rapid diagnostic test showed the presence of PV and absence of PF. The patient recovered completely with anti-malarial drugs, supportive measures, and hemodialysis.Recent microrheologic research that analyzed malaria severity in PV clearly demonstrated enhanced aggregation, erythrocyte clumping, and reduced deformability affecting microcirculation. Our case report highlights the fact that PV malaria is benign by name but not always by nature. PV can lead to unusual and potentially life-threatening complications. Further large-scale multi-centric studies are needed to define this less known entity."

CD011431,0,11258491,0,Laboratory diagnosis of malaria.,"Malaria particularly falciparum malaria is a major public health problem in India. Its correct and early diagnosis is very important for prompt treatment as a preventive and control measure. Microscopy is the traditional method for laboratory diagnosis of malaria, which is used widely. However, it is time consuming, needs expertism and the detection limit is 10-20 parasites/ml blood in thick film and 100 parasites/ml blood in thin film. Quantitative buffy coat technique (QBC) is highly sensitive method but expensive equipment is needed for this test. The serological methods involving antibody detection give information regarding exposure to malaria but do not differentiate between present and past infections. Genetic probes and PCR are highly sensitive methods but require expensive equipments. Parasite antigen detection tests are useful in field and PHC level for rapid diagnosis of P falciparum malaria.LDH based test for diagnosing malaria is sensitive but can not differentiate between species. For monitoring of drug resistance or follow-up of patients, methods which can quantify parasitaemia are needed. Simply microscopy is the best solution at present."
CD011431,0,2462660,0,Rapid diagnosis of malaria by acridine orange staining of centrifuged parasites.,"A rapid diagnostic test for malaria based on acridine orange staining of centrifuged parasites in a microhaematocrit tube ('QBC' tube) was compared with the thick blood smear in 12 volunteers experimentally infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 408 residents of a malaria endemic area, and 180 hospital patients with suspected malaria. In the experimentally infected volunteers, the QBC tube test and the thick blood smear were comparable and the QBC tube could detect as few as 4 parasites/microliter blood. When used for mass screening in the field study, the test had a sensitivity of 70% for the diagnosis of malaria compared with 92% for a single thick blood smear. However, when used to diagnose malaria in hospital patients, the test detected as few as 3 parasites/microliter in 91 of 92 patients with asexual parasitaemia. For the three studies, the QBC tube was highly specific (98.4%), indicating malaria in only 8 of 487 subjects with negative blood films. The species of parasite was correctly identified in 77% of species. Processing the QBC tube was easier and much more rapid than was processing a thick blood smear, taking only 5 min for centrifugation and 5 min for examination. The QBC tube is not a substitute for the blood smear, but its speed and ease of use make it an important new tool for the diagnosis of malaria."
CD011431,0,16333084,0,Diagnostic accuracy of two rK39 antigen-based dipsticks and the formol gel test for rapid diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in northeastern Uganda.,"The development of an accurate, practical, and affordable diagnostic test is essential to improve the management of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in remote health centers. We evaluated the Formol Gel test (FGT) and two rK39 antigen-based dipsticks, the DUAL-IT L/M, and the Kalazar Detect for VL diagnosis in Amudat Hospital in Uganda. The DUAL-IT L/M was also evaluated for the diagnosis of malaria. All patients clinically suspect of VL were prospectively included in the study between October 2003 and March 2004. The gold standard used to define a VL case was a positive spleen aspirate or a direct agglutination test titer of >1:12,800 with an appropriate clinical response to antileishmanial therapy. A total of 131 VL and 112 non-VL patients were included in the analysis. The DUAL IT L/M was found to be more sensitive than the Kalazar Detect: 97% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 92 to 99%) versus 82% (95%CI = 74 to 87%). The Kalazar Detect and the DUAL IT L/M were highly specific (99% [95%CI = 95 to 100%] and 97% [95%CI = 92 to 99%], respectively). The FGT lacked both sensitivity (66% [95%CI = 57 to 73%]) and specificity (90% [95%CI = 83 to 94%]). The sensitivity of the DUAL IT L/M for malaria was only 57% (95%CI = 37 to 76%). The two rK39 dipsticks can be used for diagnostic confirmation of VL in this region. The DUAL-IT L/M without its malaria diagnostic component (DiaMed-IT LEISH) will be adopted as first-line test for VL in Uganda."
CD011431,0,11548307,0,[Armenia: implementation of national program of malaria control].,"Malaria has been existing in Armenia since antiquity. In the 1920""s to 1930s, thousands of people suffered from this disease in the country. Enormous efforts were required to prevent further spread of the disease. A network was set up, which consisted of a research institute and stations. A total of 200,000 cases of malaria were still notified in 1934. Rapid development of the health infrastructure and better socioeconomic conditions improved the malaria situation and reduced the number of cases in 1946. Malaria was completely eradicated in Armenia in 1963, and the malaria-free situation retained till 1994. During that period, comprehensive activities were undertaken in the country to prevent and control malaria. Since 1990, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the situation became critical in many newly independent states. Economic crisis, human migration, worsening levels of health services, and the lack of necessary medicines, equipment, and insecticides significantly affected the malaria epidemiological situation in the country. Malaria cases started to penetrate into Armenia from neighboring countries. In 1994, a hundred ninety six military men contacted malaria in Karabakh, which was unfavorable in terms of malaria, as well on as the border with Iran and along the Araks river. The first cases recorded in Armenia were imported, afterwards they led to the incidence of indigenous cases, given the fact that all the prerequisites for malaria mosquito breeding and development were encountered in 17 regions and 3 towns of the country. In 1995, there were 502 imported cases and in 1996 the situation changed: out of 347 registered cases, 149 were indigenous. The Ministry of Health undertook a range of preventive measures. In 1997 versus 1996, the total number of malaria cases increased 2.3-fold: 841 registered cases of which 567 were indigenous (a 3.8-fold increase). The overwhelming majority of cases were recorded in the Ararat and Armavir marzes. In 1998, there were a total of 1156 cases, of them 542 being locally contacted. The situation became stable thanks to joint efforts of WHO, IFRX, the Armenian Red Cross Society, UNICEF, the Ministry of Health of Armenia and its Government. Under Minister's Decree No. 292 of May 17, 1999, a malaria project implementation office was established in the Masis Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance Center of Hygienic and Antiepidemic Surveillance to improve progress of the malaria control programme in Armenia. WHO allocated some 7,700 USD for 5-month maintenance and work of the office. Thus, analyzing the malaria cases registered in 1999 and 1998 indicates a 1.9-fold decrease (616/77). The setting up the malaria programme field office under the Minister's decree was instrumental in planning and implementing activities in situ. In 1999, four cases of tropical malaria were recorded in Armenia. The patients were Armenian pilots who contacted malaria during duty travels: 1 in Sudan and 3 in Congo. The list of pilots making flying to endemic countries was submitted to the Republican Center to implement preventive measures in the future. In Armenia malaria surveillance has been improved to ensure timely detection of all suspected cases and to carry out malaria control activities. In this regard, a seminar was held for 21 entomologists and 12 parasitologists. UNICEF and WHO Armenian offices provided a substantial support to organize seminars. To facilitate the seminars, the manual ""Malaria parasitology and entomology"" was published and distributed among their participants. On April 19, 1999, the session of the Ministry's Executive Board (Collegium) gave recommendations to reinforce malaria control activities in the country. Decrees No. 256 of May 31, 1999, No. 47 of May 29, 1999, and No. 245 of April 30, 1999, ""On malaria and preventive and control activities"" were issued by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security to serve as a guideline for planning and implementing activities. The Ministry of Agriculture undertook to clean the collective irrigation (drainage) system covering 102 and 77 km in the Ararat and Armavir marzes, the Ministry of Health provided a list of endemic foci where cleaning was a priority. Taking into account the importance of the people's participation in ensuring effective prevention and control, emphasis was laid on health education activities: publication of leaflets, as well as articles in local newspapers, radio broadcasts and TV shows. Throughout the season, the early detection of malaria cases, timely hospitalization (in no later than 1-3 days) for at least 5 days and subsequent treatment under direct supervision of a physician were successfully carried out due to home-to-home visits. Entomological studies conducted in the malaria foci show an increase in the presence and density of a malaria vector in the buildings. As far as treatment is concerned, the overall surface of stagnant waters comprised 2642 ha in 1999 (2733 ha in 1998), including 1285 ha of anophelogenic stagnant waters (2276 ha in 1998). The biggest stagnant water surfaces were in the Ararat and Armavir marzes--2209 ha, where the majority of malaria cases were recorded. A total of 1,283,111 and 559,213 sq. m. of constructions were treated in 1999 and 1998, respectively, out them there were 1,259,637 sq. m. in 5 endemic regions. Stagnant water surfaces were treated with bacticulicides on 250.7 and 743.8 (almost 3 times more) in 1998 and 1999, respectively. In 1999, 740 ha of surface were biologically treated using Gambusia compared to 900 ha treated in 1998. There is no highly qualified diagnostic specialists in many regions of the country, which necessitates the holding of further seminars involving relevant specialists, in all malaria regions. There is a tendency of geographical spread of malaria: malaria cases occur in new regions and dwellings. A country-wide action plan was drafted for 2000, mainly focusing on staff training. With WHO assistance, a seminar was held for 324 specialists from endemic regions. During the first quarter of 2000, 13 cases of tertian malaria were recorded as compared 59 cases during the same period of last year. All these patients contacted malaria in the previous season and demonstrated long incubation periods. Thus, the malaria control plan recommended by WHO and the rational and targeted use of its assistance has shown a 2-fold decrease in the incidence of malaria."

CD011431,0,19376669,0,Development of a stable positive control to be used for quality assurance of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria.,"The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a simple, cheap, and stable positive control for the quality control and quality assurance (QA) of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for the diagnosis of malaria. Plasmodium falciparum in vitro culture of known parasite concentrations was dried on a protein saver card, that is, dried blood spots (DBSs). The cards were stored at temperatures ranging from 27 to 60 degrees C from 1 day up to 6 months. Antigens were subsequently eluted from the card giving final concentrations ranging from 30 000 parasites to 300 parasites/microL and tested for stability against RDT based on the antigens parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), aldolase, and histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2). HRP-2 antigens were stable throughout the whole study and yielded positive results irrespective of parasite concentration, storage duration, or temperature, although band intensity differences could be observed when high parasites were compared with low parasite densities. Aldolase was able to generate positive signals for up to 4 weeks irrespective of the storage conditions. Thereafter, intensities decreased proportionally to increasing temperature and storage duration. Thirty thousand parasites per liter could give a signal up to 16 weeks when stored at a temperature of maximum 45 degrees C. However, densities of 300 parasites/microL were not able to generate a signal during the study. pLDH, the least stable of the 3 antigens, was not able to generate a signal after 1 week of storage. The DBS method yields a very stable positive control for quality control and QA of RDTs based on HRP-2. RDTs based on aldolase may also benefit from this method although to a lesser extent because that particular antigen is less stable in the DBS system."

We used 123 blood samples from 60 control subjects and 63 patients with immune complex diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, rheumatoid arthritis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, renal diseases, vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia, Gram-negative bacteremia, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatic heart disease, malaria, and chronic active hepatitis. Immunofixation and quantification of C3d were better for detecting complement activation, their sensitivity rates (90.5% and 89.3%, respectively) being higher than those of the other tests studied. Immunofixation is a relatively simple and inexpensive test, provides good resolution of protein bands, and yields results that are easily quantified with a densitometer. Nephelometry of C3d provides more rapid and accurate quantitative results than immunofixation, but commercial reagents are not yet available. The causes of false-positive results in complement tests and the mechanisms of complement activation in AIDS are also discussed."

In this study three different quantitative, real-time PCR methods were compared with routine methods used for malaria diagnosis. A comparative study was conducted prospectively in the laboratories of Montpellier and Nîmes University Hospitals. The methods used for routine diagnostic malaria testing consisted of microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears and rapid diagnostic tests. Three quantitative real-time PCR methods (qRT-PCR) were tested: qRT-PCR1 amplified a specific sequence on the P. falciparum Cox1 gene, qRT-PCR2 amplified a species-specific region of the multicopy 18S rDNA, and qRT-PCR3 amplified a mitochondrial DNA sequence. Among the 196 blood samples collected, 73 samples were positive in at least one of the five tests. Compared with the routine method, there were no false negatives for P. falciparum diagnosis in either qRT-PCR1 or qRT-PCR3. In all P. ovale, P. vivax and P. malariae infections diagnosed from blood smears, qRT-PCR1 was negative, as expected, whereas qRT-PCR2 and qRT-PCR3 were positive and concordant (simple kappa coefficient = 1). One negative sample from microscopy was positive with both qRT-PCR2 and qRT-PCR3. Together, qRT-PCR3 and the combined qRT-PCR1 and qRT-PCR2 were concordant with routine methods for malaria diagnosis (99% and 99.5%, respectively). These three rapid, molecular qRT-PCR methods, used alone or in association, showed excellent results, with high concordance, accuracy and reliability in malaria diagnosis."

A pan-malarial LDH antibody directed against a common malaria LDH peptide (APGKSDKEWNRDDLL) and two anti-peptide antibodies, each targeting a unique Plasmodium falciparum (LISDAELEAIFDC) and Plasmodium vivax (KITDEEVEGIFDC) LDH peptide were raised in chickens. The antibodies were affinity purified with the appropriate peptide affinity matrix. The affinity purified anti-peptide antibodies detected recombinant P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. yoelii LDH and native P. falciparum and P. yoelii LDH in western blots and immunofluorescence studies. The pan-malarial antibody detected LDH from the three malaria species in western blots. The species-specific anti-peptide antibodies differentiated between P. falciparum and P. vivax LDH. Affinity purified chicken antibodies against recombinant PfLDH, PvLDH and PyLDH proteins each detected the parent and orthologous proteins with similar titers in an ELISA. The study supports an anti-peptide antibody approach to the development of diagnostic reagents."
CD011431,0,7943549,0,"A highly sensitive, rapid, and simple polymerase chain reaction-based method to detect human malaria (Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax) in blood samples.","A highly sensitive, rapid and simple method to detect human malaria in blood samples was developed. Malaria parasite DNA in blood from a fingerprick was directly amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two sets of primers to yield a 206-basepair (bp) product for Plasmodium falciparum and a 183-bp product for P. vivax. Both were easily visualized in an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, allowing identification of the two human malaria species in a single amplification reaction. As little as a one P. falciparum and/or P. vivax parasite per microliter of blood was detectable by this method, a sensitivity superior to that of thick blood film microscopy. The total time required for diagnosis of 48 blood samples, starting from fingerprick blood collection, was approximately 4 hr. When compared with microscopic examination by an expert microscopist, results showed a sensitivity of 89% for P. falciparum and 91% for P. vivax and an overall specificity of 94%. Six infected blood samples classified by microscopy as single species were diagnosed by the PCR method as being mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax infections. The high sensitivity, rapidity, and simplicity of the method should make it attractive for a large-scale epidemiology study, follow-up of drug treatment, and immunization trials."
CD011431,0,22550113,0,Malaria rapid diagnostic tests.,"Global efforts to control malaria are more complex than those for other infectious diseases, in part because of vector transmission, the complex clinical presentation of Plasmodium infections, >1 Plasmodium species causing infection, geographic distribution of vectors and infection, and drug resistance. The World Health Organization approach to global malaria control focuses on 2 components: vector control and diagnosis and treatment of clinical malaria. Although microscopy performed on peripheral blood smears remains the most widely used diagnostic test and the standard against which other tests are measured, rapid expansion of diagnostic testing worldwide will require use of other diagnostic approaches. This review will focus on the malaria rapid diagnostic test (MRDT) for detecting malaria parasitemia, both in terms of performance characteristics of MRDTs and how they are used under field conditions. The emphasis will be on the performance and use of MRDTs in regions of endemicity, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, where most malaria-related deaths occur."

Despite schizonticidal treatment and multisystem support in intensive care the husband died. The selection of chemoprophylactic agents for this couple was not ideal and the duration of therapy before exposure to risk was inadequate. Severe infection with plasmodium falciparum is life-threatening and requires early diagnosis. It is best managed in an intensive care unit where continuous assessment may enable rapid detection of clinical deterioration and allow appropriate treatment to be instituted. The diagnosis should be considered in symptomatic patients who have travelled through areas where malaria is endemic. Recognised guidelines for the prescription of malarial chemoprophylaxis should be followed to ensure adequate protection.

Plasmodium falciparum antigen preparation, obtained from sonicated cultures of the parasite at a parasitemia of 10%-15%, was applied to cellulose filter discs in volumes of 0.1 microliter in 96-well microtiter plates. Antibodies were detected by successive incubations with: bovine serum albumin for blocking, tested serum at different dilutions, peroxidase-conjugated antihuman IgG, and the precipitable substrate 4-chloro-1-naphtol. Positive reactions appeared as blue dots on a white background which are easily read by eye. Pools of sera from patients with recent disease or from individuals with a history of malaria, contained antibodies detectable up to a dilution of 1:64,000. Negative results were obtained when normal RBC were used for dotting the filters. Normal sera showed no reaction at any antigen concentration. P. falciparum antigens were detected by their ability to inhibit the binding of antibody to the filters. RBC infected with P. falciparum in vitro can be detected at a level of 0.001% parasitemia. This report presents the feasibility of an assay for detecting malarial antibodies and antigens in blood samples which is easily applicable to field conditions."

We have developed a new real-time PCR with specific genes in each Plasmodium species present only in one copy to identify the four pathogenic Plasmodium spp. for humans. The sensitivity was less than 25 parasites/microl. No cross-hybridisation was observed with human DNA or among the four Plasmodium spp. Using LightCycler PCR and conventional microscopy, we compared the diagnosis of malaria in patients from Vietnam and in returned European travellers with suspicion of malaria. In patients from Vietnam with suspicion of malaria, one mixed infection was observed by PCR only; the remaining data (54 of 55 patients) correlated with microscopy. In 79 patients without symptoms, low parasitaemia was detected in 7 samples by microscopy and in 16 samples by PCR. In returned travellers, PCR results were correlated with microscopy for all four species in 48 of 56 samples. The eight discrepant results were resolved in favour of real-time PCR diagnosis. This new real-time PCR is a rapid, accurate and efficient method for malaria diagnosis in returned travellers as well as for epidemiological studies or antimalarial efficiency trials in the field."

A case of knowlesi malaria is described in a Swedish man, who became ill after returning from a short visit to Malaysian Borneo in October 2006. His P. knowlesi infection was not detected using a rapid diagnostic test for malaria, but was confirmed by PCR and molecular characterization. He responded rapidly to treatment with mefloquine. Evaluation of rapid diagnostic kits with further samples from knowlesi malaria patients are necessary, since early identification and appropriate anti-malarial treatment of suspected cases are essential due to the rapid growth and potentially life-threatening nature of P. knowlesi. Physicians should be aware that knowlesi infection is an important differential diagnosis in febrile travellers, with a recent travel history to forested areas in south-east Asia, including short-term travellers who tested negative with rapid diagnostic tests."

CD011431,0,21426579,0,Low prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum antigenaemia among asymptomatic HAART-treated adults in an urban cohort in Uganda.,"Presumptive treatment of malaria is common practice in malaria endemic resource-limited settings. With the changing epidemiology of malaria and the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), there is increasing need for parasite-based malaria case management to prevent unnecessary use of anti-malarial medicines, improve patient care in parasite-positive patients and identify parasite-negative patients in whom another diagnosis must be sought. Although parasitological confirmation by microscopy or alternatively by malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is recommended in all patients suspected of malaria before treatment, gaps remain in the implementation of this policy in resource-limited settings.

More than 2,000 inhabitants, accounting for 61.8% of the total estimated population, were examined. Malaria infection was confirmed in all villages surveyed by ICT and microscopic diagnosis. The positive rates of P. falciparum malaria by microscopy ranged from 9.7% to 59.2% (mean 27.2%), whereas by ICT they were from 11.6% to 64.5% (mean 29.8%). The positive rates by ICT were generally higher in 8 out of 13 villages. However, a significant difference between the positive rates by microscopy and ICT was not observed in all villages. Plasmodium falciparum infection was actually confirmed by microscopy in 84.1% of specimens that tested positive by ICT. The results by ICT were consistent with those of the microscopic diagnosis, the discrepancy of the results was less than 10% (141/2,066).

It aims to provide tuberculosis drugs to treat up to 11.6 million patients over the next 5 years and to assist countries to reach the WHO global TB control targets by 2005. The GDF was launched on 24 March 2001. Six rounds of applications have been completed, with 46 countries and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) approved for support. The GDF is not a traditional procurement mechanism. It has adopted an innovative approach to the supply of drugs, by linking demand for drugs to supply and monitoring, using partners to provide services, using product packaging to simplify drug management and linking grants to TB programme performance. This paper describes the GDF operational procedures and experience gained so far. Key achievements to date are also outlined, including the creation of a flexible supply system to meet differing programme needs, rapid establishment of procedures, reduction in TB drug prices--a catalyst for DOTS expansion in countries, standardisation of products, and collaboration with partners. The GDF is flexible enough to meet the needs of countries with a TB burden. The GDF experience could be used as an example for global procurement of drugs and commodities for other diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. In the future it is likely that the GDF will expand to include second-line drugs and diagnostic materials for TB and could assist other partnerships to develop similar mechanisms and facilities to meet country needs."

While the existing methods were developed for the determination of either AS or AQ in biological fluids, the current validated method allows simultaneous extraction and determination of AS and AQ in human plasma. Extraction is carried out on Supelclean LC-18 extraction cartridges where AS, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and the internal standard artemisinin (QHS) are separated from AQ, its metabolite desethylamodiaquine (DeAQ) and the internal standard, an isobutyl analogue of desethylamodiaquine (IB-DeAQ).

This situation is further complicated by the emergence and rapid progression of resistance to chloroquine, the recommended first line treatment. In order to document the level of resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine, pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (Fansidar) and quinine, we performed a survey in Tabou district, Côre d'Ivoire, from June to August 1995. This area has been hosting some 100,000 Liberian refugees since September 1994. Children aged 1 to 15 years old attending the dispensary with a complain of fever or suspected malaria, were included into the study, diagnosed and followed for 7 days according to the WHO Standard Field (in vivo) Tests. Overall proportion of P. falciparum resistant to chloroquine reached 45.1% and was made of 34.3% type II and 10.8% type III resistance. Being less than 5 years of age and having received a lower dose of drug were 2 factors associated with the risk of resistance to chloroquine. Levels of R II resistance to pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine and quinine (3-day treatment) were respectively 5.4% and 4.2%. No R III resistance was found in neither pyrimethaminelsulfadoxine or quinine treatment groups. These results challenge the current chloroquine-based first line malaria treatment in Côre d'Ivoire. Alternative based on pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine could be considered, especially in high risk populations during transient situation (refugees).

CD011431,0,17822533,0,World Antimalarial Resistance Network (WARN) II: in vitro antimalarial drug susceptibility.,"Intrinsic resistance of Plasmodium falciparum is clearly a major determinant of the clinical failure of antimalarial drugs. However, complex interactions between the host, the parasite and the drug obscure the ability to define parasite drug resistance in vivo. The in vitro antimalarial drug susceptibility assay determines ex-vivo growth of parasite in the presence of serial drug concentrations and, thus, eliminates host effects, such as drug metabolism and immunity. Although the sensitivity of the parasite to various antimalarials provided by such a test provides an important indicator of intrinsic parasite susceptibility, there are fundamental methodological issues that undermine comparison of in vitro susceptibility both between laboratories and within a single laboratory over time. A network of laboratories is proposed that will agree on the basic parameters of the in vitro test and associated measures of quality control. The aim of the network would be to establish baseline values of sensitivity to commonly used antimalarial agents from key regions of the world, and create a global database, linked to clinical, molecular and pharmacology databases, to support active surveillance to monitor temporal trends in parasite susceptibility. Such a network would facilitate the rapid detection of strains with novel antimalarial resistance profiles and investigate suitable alternative treatments with retained efficacy."

However, adolescent girls did not consider themselves at risk of malaria even when pregnant. Anaemia and low birth weight were not well understood and not related to malaria in pregnancy. Self-medication was common including over the counter drugs, herbs or a combination of both. When this failed, several options were taken such as seeking care at health units. People preferred to visit heath units with laboratory facilities, since investigations were valued and perceived useful. These investigations were locally known as okukebera omusayi, which translates to examining blood This local term is non-specific and used when patients are referred to laboratories to investigate diseases like HIV, syphilis and malaria. The use of this term however, discourages some people who are afraid of knowing their HIV status. Similarly, the notion that HIV/AIDS is spread thorough contaminated needles and syringes discourages people from giving blood for laboratory tests. In addition, the cost of investigations, fear of pain due to pricking, and the rudeness of laboratory technicians negatively influence seeking laboratory tests. Implications of these findings include developing a health promotion package that explains the dangers of self medication and advocates prompt seeking for malaria treatment especially for adolescents and primigravidae. Policy decisions to introduce rapid diagnostic kits (RDTs) in primary care units including drug shops are required in order to improve effective treatment of malaria."

However, in a five year period at a district general hospital, the number of laboratory-diagnosed cases of malaria increased annually from 25 to 84, a rise of 336%. Except for two induced infections, all were imported, mainly from the Indian subcontinent. Plasmodium vivax was responsible for 87.29% of the cases; P.falciparum (12.05%), a mixed infection of P.vivax and P.falciparum (0.33%) and a case of P.ovale (0.33%) were also identified. Rapid preparation of acetone-fixed, Giemsa-stained thick blood films, a heightened awareness of the infection, examination of multiple samples of blood from patients and the general resurgence of malaria in endemic areas were some of the factors responsible for the high number of cases diagnosed. Most patients were young males and presented with clinical malaria due to P.vivax between May and October each year, an apparent seasonal peak. However, many were already resident in the country for a variable period. Patients with P.falciparum though, presented clinically within two weeks of arrival in the country. Parasite densities were calculated to monitor the progress of treatment and identify quickly any possible chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum strains. A policy of active prophylaxis is suggested to stem the tide of imported malaria."
CD011431,0,12518844,1,Short report: Failure of the OptiMAL rapid malaria test as a tool for the detection of asymptomatic malaria in an area of Thailand endemic for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax.,"We evaluated the efficacy of the OptiMAL assay in a cross-sectional malaria survey in western Thailand from April to August 2001. Expert microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films was used as the gold standard. Positive control lines were evident in 99% (1,128 of 1,137) of the assays tested. However, 34% (384 of 1,128) of assays produced an aberrant result (a positive P. falciparum-specific line and a negative panmalarial line). False-positive panmalarial and Plasmodium falciparum-specific lines occurred in 25.9% (270 of 1,042) and 60.3% (628 of 1,042) of microscopy-negative samples, respectively. Due to the preponderance of false-positive test results, it was necessary to develop subjective criteria for test positivity based on line intensity. For determination of assay performance during this study, we therefore considered all test lines that were scored as intermediate or strong as positive and lines that were faint as negative. Using these criteria, we determined that the sensitivity of the OptiMAL assay for P. falciparum was 25% with > 500 parasites/microl and 10.5% with > 100 parasites/microl, while for P. vivax, the sensitivity at the same parasite rates was 100% and 41.7%, respectively. Further studies are required to determine whether the problems we identified are limited to this particular lot of OptiMAL assays."
CD011431,0,21350795,0,Detecting mutations in PfCRT and PfMDR1 genes among Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Saudi Arabia by pyrosequencing.,"The emergence of chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is a significant public health problem where malaria is endemic. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pyrosequencing to assess chloroquine resistance among P. falciparum isolates from the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia by analyzing the K76T and N86Y mutations in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) and P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (PfMDR1) genes, respectively. Blood samples (n = 121) from microscopically positive P. falciparum cases were collected. DNA was extracted, and fragments from each of the genes were amplified by PCR using new sets of primers. The amplicons were sequenced using a pyrosequencer. All of the 121 samples were amplified for assessment of the PfCRT K76T and PfMDR1 N86Y mutations. All of the samples amplified for the PfCRT 76T mutation harbored the ACA codon (121/121; 100%), indicating the presence of the 76T mutation. For the PfMDR1 N86Y mutation, 72/121 samples (59.5%) had the sequence AAT at that position, indicating the presence of the wild-type allele (86N). However, 49/121 samples (40.5%) had a TAT codon, indicating the mutant allele (Y) at position 86. This study shows that pyrosequencing could be useful as a high throughput, rapid, and sensitive assay for the detection of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in drug-resistant P. falciparum strains. This will help health authorities in malaria-endemic regions to adopt new malaria control strategies that will be applicable for diagnostic and drug resistance assays for malaria and other life-threatening pathogens that are endemic in their respective countries."

The process is known as active case detection, but because the information is time sensitive, it is difficult to carry out. In Zambia, the rural health services are operating effectively and for the most part are provided with adequate supplies of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) as well as effective drugs for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria. The tests are administered to all prior to treatment and appropriate records are kept. Data are obtained in a timely manner and distribution of this information is important for the effective management of malaria control operations. The work reported here involves combining the process of positive diagnoses in rural health centres (passive case detection) to help detect potential outbreaks of malaria and target interventions to foci where parasite reservoirs are likely to occur."
CD011431,0,21499691,0,Clinical practice: the diagnosis of imported malaria in children.,"The present paper reviews the diagnosis of imported malaria in children. Malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium and occurs in over 100 countries worldwide. Children account for 10-15% of all patients with imported malaria and are at risk to develop severe and life-threatening complications especially when infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Case-fatality ratios vary between 0.2% and 0.4%. Children visiting friends and relatives in malaria endemic areas and immigrants and refugees account for the vast majority of cases. Symptoms are non-specific and delayed infections (more than 3 months after return from an endemic country) may occur. Microscopic analysis of the thick blood film is the cornerstone of laboratory diagnosis. For pragmatic reasons, EDTA-anticoagulated blood is accepted, provided that slides are prepared within 1 h after collection. Information about the Plasmodium species (in particular P. falciparum versus the non-falciparum species) and the parasite density is essential for patient management. Molecular methods in reference settings are an adjunct for species differentiation. Signals generated by automated hematology analyzers may trigger the diagnosis of malaria in non-suspected cases. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests are reliable in the diagnosis of P. falciparum but not for the detection of the non-falciparum species. They do not provide information about parasite density and should be used as an adjunct (and not a substitute) to microscopy. In case of persistent suspicion and negative microscopy results, repeat testing every 8-12 h for at least three consecutive samplings is recommended. A high index of suspicion and a close interaction with the laboratory may assure timely diagnosis of imported malaria."

Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax co-exist and malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDTs) is vital in rendering parasite-confirmed treatment especially in areas where microscopy from 2008 to 2010 is not available. CareStartTM Malaria Pf/Pv combo test was evaluated compared to microscopy in Butajira area, south-central Ethiopia. This RDT detects histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP2) found in P. falciparum, and Plasmodium enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) for diagnosis of P. vivax. The standard for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies was complied. Among 2,394 participants enrolled, 10.9% (n=87) were Plasmodium infected (household survey) and 24.5% (n=392) health facility-based using microscopy. In the household surveys, the highest positivity was caused by P. vivax (83.9%, n=73), P. falciparum (15.0%, n=13), and the rest due to mixed infections of both (1.1%, n=1). In health facility, P. vivax caused 78.6% (n=308), P. falciparum caused 20.4% (n=80), and the rest caused by mixed infections 1.0% (n=4). RDT missed 9.1% (n=8) in household and 4.3% (n=17) in health facility-based surveys among Plasmodium positive confirmed by microscopy while 3.3% (n=24) in household and 17.2% (n=208) in health facility-based surveys were detected false positive. RDT showed agreement with microscopy in detecting 79 positives in household surveys (n=796) and 375 positives in health centre survey (n=1,598).RDT performance varied in both survey settings, lowest PPV (64.3%) for Plasmodium and P. falciparum (77.2%) in health centres; and Plasmodium (76.7%) and P. falciparum (87.5%) in household surveys. NPV was low in P. vivax in health centres (77.2%) and household (87.5%) surveys. Seasonally varying RDT precision of as low as 14.3% PPV (Dec. 2009), and 38.5% NPV (Nov. 2008) in health centre surveys; and 40-63.6% PPV was observed in household surveys. But the influence of age and parasite density on RDT performance was not ascertained. Establishing quality control of malaria RDT in the health system in areas with low endemic and where P. falciparum and P. vivax co-exist is recommendable. CareStartTM RDT might be employed for epidemiological studies that require interpreting the results cautiously. Future RDT field evaluation against microscopy should be PCR corrected."

In P. falciparum, the cause of the most lethal human malaria, chloroquine resistance is linked to multiple mutations in PfCRT, a protein that likely functions as a transporter in the parasite's digestive vacuole membrane. Rapid diagnostic assays for PfCRT mutations are already employed as surveillance tools for drug resistance. However, several reports have been published demonstrating cases with CO resistance. Sporadic cases have been reported as well as one large scale study demonstrated 12.4% resistance. However, all these reports were based on treatment failure (in vivo). rather than in vitro or molecular bases. Evidence suggests a crucial role for a point mutation in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene on chromosome 7 in conferring CQ resistance. The mutation in the K76 codon in 3 cases out of 60 (5%) using ApoI restriction enzyme was detected. Although the percentage of drug resistance was not quite disturbing, but represented the possible establishment of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum in Saudi Arabia, or the beginning of resistant strains by labors coming from abroad. Cross-border importation of resistant strains from neighboring countries must be considered. In vivo tests must be conducted parallel with the molecular markers to estimate more precisely the actual prevalence of resistance. Validation of molecular markers is urgently required and needs strong collaborative partnerships between subregional and regional networks."
CD011431,0,22848096,0,Reductions in artemisinin-based combination therapy consumption after the nationwide scale up of routine malaria rapid diagnostic testing in Zambia.,"The National Malaria Control Center of Zambia introduced rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to detect Plasmodium falciparum as a pilot in some districts in 2005 and 2006; scale up at a national level was achieved in 2009. Data on RDT use, drug consumption, and diagnostic results were collected in three Zambian health districts to determine the impact RDTs had on malaria case management over the period 2004-2009. Reductions were seen in malaria diagnosis and antimalarial drug prescription (66.1 treatments per facility-month (95% confidence interval [CI] = 44.7-87.4) versus 26.6 treatments per facility-month (95% CI = 11.8-41.4)) pre- and post-RDT introduction. Results varied between districts, with significant reductions in low transmission areas but none in high areas. Rapid diagnostic tests may contribute to rationalization of treatment of febrile illness and reduce antimalarial drug consumption in Africa; however, their impact may be greater in lower transmission areas. National scale data will be necessary to confirm these findings."

The global burden of malaria has increased over the last several decades, as have rates of imported malaria into non-endemic regions. Rapid and accurate diagnostics are a crucial component of malaria control strategies, and epidemiological surveillance is required to monitor trends in malaria prevalence and antimalarial drug resistance. Conventional malaria diagnostic and surveillance tools can be cumbersome and slow with limitations in both sensitivity and specificity.

CD011431,0,11230422,1,Persistent ICT malaria P.f/P.v panmalarial and HRP2 antigen reactivity after treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is associated with gametocytemia and results in false-positive diagnoses of Plasmodium vivax in convalescence.,"A problem with rapid Plasmodium falciparum-specific antigen histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) detection tests for malaria is the persistence of antigen in blood after the disappearance of asexual-stage parasitemia and clinical symptoms, resulting in false-positive (FP) test results following treatment. The ICT P.f/P.v immunochromatographic test detects both HRP2 and a panmalarial antigen (PMA) found in both P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. To examine posttreatment antigen persistence with this test and whether persistent sexual-stage forms (gametocytes) are a cause of FP tests after treatment, we compared serial antigen test results with microscopy results from patients symptomatic with P. falciparum malaria in Indonesia for 28 days following treatment with chloroquine (CQ; n = 66), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; n = 36), and artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (ART + SP; n = 15). Persistent FP antigenemia following SP treatment occurred in 29% (HRP2) and 42% (PMA) of the patients on day 7 and in 10% (HRP2) and 23% (PMA) on day 14. The high rates of persistent HRP2 and PMA antigenemia following CQ and SP treatment were strongly associated with the presence of gametocytemia, with the proportion with gametocytes on day 7 posttreatment being significantly greater in those with FP results than in those with true-negative PMA and HRP2 results. Gametocyte frequency on day 14 post-SP treatment was also greater in those with FP PMA results. Following SP treatment, PMA persisted longer than HRP2, giving an FP diagnosis of P. vivax in up to 16% of patients on day 14, with all FP P. vivax diagnoses having gametocytemia. In contrast, PMA was rapidly cleared following ART + SP treatment in association with rapid clearance of gametocytemia. Gametocytes appear to be an important cause of persistent posttreatment panmalarial antigenemia in areas of endemicity and may also contribute in part to persistent HRP2 antigenemia following treatment."

CD011431,0,12358891,0,Thrombocytopenia in patients with malaria: automated analysis of optical platelet counts and platelet clumps with the Cell Dyn CD4000 analyser.,"Platelet counts and automated detection of platelet clumps were evaluated by optical analysis with the Abbott CD4000 analyser (Abbott Diagnostics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in this South African study of 828 samples referred for malaria investigations. Based on microscopy (Micro) and rapid tests (RT) for HRP2 protein and parasite-associated LDH, malaria negative samples (n = 417) were defined as Micro-, RT-. Convalescent cases (n = 64) were Micro-, RT+ and had a recent record of positive microscopy. Malaria positive cases were subdivided into Micro+ (n = 315) and Micro-, RT+, PCR+ (polymerase chain reaction) (n = 32) subgroups. The mean platelet count for Micro+ cases (89.7 x 10(9)/l) was significantly lower than both the malaria negative (mean 212.6 x 10(9)/l) and convalescent malaria (mean 152.8 x 10(9)/l) groups; 89% of microscopy positive cases were thrombocytopenic (< 150 x 10(9)/l) and 30% had severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 10(9)/l). For comparison, 32% of the 417 malaria negative samples were thrombocytopenic and 6% of these were severe. Two thirds of samples with parasitaemia above 10% had platelet counts of < 50 x 10(9)/l while the counts were largely independent of parasite numbers when the parasitaemia was below 10%. Thirty percent of samples with microscopically detectable parasites had a PltClmp flag compared to 13% of the malaria negative group but, when the actual platelet count was taken into account, it became apparent that appearance of the flag was primarily associated with thrombocytopenia per se rather than malaria status. In most samples with a PltClmp flag, the CD4000 optical platelet clump 'signature' was indicative of small platelet aggregates and giant platelets. Morphological examination confirmed the presence of varying numbers of small platelet aggregates (3-12 individual platelets), often together with increased giant platelets, in many samples with a PltClmp flag. The observations suggest that while patients with malaria may be predisposed to the development of thrombocytopenia, a reduced platelet count in some patients may also be due in part to pseudo-thrombocytopenia."

The sensitivity of PCR was 1 parasite/microl, i.e.: 50 times more sensitive than microscopy. When PCR was compared with microscopy, the sensitivity and specificity were 90% & 100% respectively. The sensitivity recorded was pLDH test in comparison to PCR (95%). The malaria antibody test recorded the least sensitivity (68%) PCR proved as the gold standard for evaluation of applied tests and the newly introduced ones. In absence of an expert microscopist, the pLDH test could substitute for microscopy. The test proved valuable to assess clinical cure, and predict drug resistance. Its advantage over microscopy was the ability to diagnose infection with low parasitemic patients. Antibody rapid tests might be not valuable in acute cases, but still accepted as a tool in epidemiological studies and in screening patients in blood banks in malaria endemic areas."

The system is based on the monitoring of malaria morbidity (clinical diagnosis) in 536 peripheral health centres (CSB) of the Highlands. The intervention area corresponds to 27 districts of the Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa provinces (4.7 million inhabitants) and spans around 100,000 square km. For each CSB a monthly warning threshold, defined as the 1993-1996 monthly mean number of malaria cases plus two standard deviations, was established. Three levels of epidemic alert have been defined according to the number of times the cases of presumptive malaria surpassed the threshold and according to the reported presence of severe malaria cases. The surveillance system relies also on the monitoring, in district hospitals of the Highlands, of the Plasmodium falciparum infection rate among clinically diagnosed malaria cases. A total of 185,589 presumptive malaria cases, corresponding to a 42/1000 malaria incidence, were recorded in 1997 by the surveillance system. During the same year 184 alerts of 2nd degree were reported. During 1998 173,632 presumptive malaria cases corresponding to a 38/1000 incidence were reported and 207 alerts of 2nd degree were detected; 75 of these alerts were investigated with ad hoc surveys and 3 initial malaria epidemics identified and controlled. Out of 6884 presumptive malaria cases diagnosed in the district hospitals during 1997-1998, only 835 (12.1%) have been confirmed by microscopy (P. falciparum 81.7%, P. vivax 15.0%, P. malariae 2.5%, P. ovale 0.2%, mixed infections 0.6%); 22.4% of these infections were imported cases from coastal endemic areas.

CD011431,0,22027922,0,"Abolishing user fees for children and pregnant women trebled uptake of malaria-related interventions in Kangaba, Mali.","Malaria is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 in Mali. Health centres provide primary care, including malaria treatment, under a system of cost recovery. In 2005, Médecins sans Frontieres (MSF) started supporting health centres in Kangaba with the provision of rapid malaria diagnostic tests and artemisinin-based combination therapy. Initially MSF subsidized malaria tests and drugs to reduce the overall cost for patients. In a second phase, MSF abolished fees for all children under 5 irrespective of their illness and for pregnant women with fever. This second phase was associated with a trebling of both primary health care utilization and malaria treatment coverage for these groups. MSF's experience in Mali suggests that removing user fees for vulnerable groups significantly improves utilization and coverage of essential health services, including for malaria interventions. This effect is far more marked than simply subsidizing or providing malaria drugs and diagnostic tests free of charge. Following the free care strategy, utilization of services increased significantly and under-5 mortality was reduced. Fee removal also allowed for more efficient use of existing resources, reducing average cost per patient treated. These results are particularly relevant for the context of Mali and other countries with ambitious malaria treatment coverage objectives, in accordance with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. This article questions the effectiveness of the current national policy, and the effectiveness of reducing the cost of drugs only (i.e. partial subsidies) or providing malaria tests and drugs free for under-5s, without abolishing other related fees.

A new diagnostic tool for Plasmodium falciparum infection.,"A rapid manual test for Plasmodium falciparum, the ParaSight-F test, has been used on a series of patients in a holoendemic malaria area of coastal Tanzania. The test, which is an antigen capture test detecting trophozoite-derived histidine rich protein-II, is simple to perform and provides a definitive answer in about 10 min. It requires no special equipment and is read using a single drop of blood. When compared with 272 thick blood films examined microscopically by 2 observers and confirmed by the QBC malaria test, the ParaSight-F test had 88.9% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity. Detectable antigenaemia in a group of 40 people declined following treatment with Fansidar and by 10 d after treatment all but 4 individuals were antigen free. The remaining 4, although clear of peripheral parasitaemia, remained antigenaemic for 14 d. The test shows great promise for rapid effective diagnosis of P. falciparum in clinics and village health centres where there is no facility for microscopy. Because of its accuracy and rapid action it may even obviate the need for microscopical examination of blood films to diagnose P. falciparum malaria."
CD011431,0,1842063,0,DNA diagnosis of falciparum malaria.,"We have developed DNA diagnosis using Universal probe system for the rapid detection of Plasmodium falciparum parasite in blood. We chose the DHFR-TS (dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase) gene as target for detection which are the junction part (410 bp) of and the DHFR part (790 bp). In the parasite, there is only one copy of target sequence, therefore, the target sequences were amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to increase the sensitivity. Our hybridization method consists of two probes; a primary probe prepared from a chimeric phage-plasmid vector (pUCf1) containing sequence complementary to the target, and a biotin-labeled secondary probe complementary to a portion of the primary probe, which is detected by the BCIP/NBT method. We showed that the 410 bp was more sensitive than the 790 bp as a target of P. falciparum, and the limit of detection was 10(3) parasites in 1 ml human blood using 410 bp junction part. We also constructed double PCR systems using junction part of DHFR-TS gene. By amplification of the 410 bp of the junction part and reamplification of 228 bp of inside sequence of the 410 bp, as little as 10 parasites in 10 microliters human blood was sufficient for specific detection."

The clinical symptoms and signs of 35 patients were consistent with leptospirosis. The final diagnosis for the remaining patients was as follows: 136 with typhoid fever, 82 with hepatitis, 74 with malaria, 48 with infections of the respiratory tract, and 20 with fever of unknown origin. The clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis was confirmed for 24 (68.6%) patients by the combined results of the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), the reference test for leptospirosis, and of IgM ELISA, a standard laboratory test for the serodiagnosis of leptospirosis. In addition, serum specimens from 8 (2.2%) patients with a final clinical diagnosis other than leptospirosis were found to be positive in MAT and/or IgM ELISA. Compared with the results of MAT and IgM ELISA a sensitivity of 91.6% and specificity of 93.6% was calculated for the dipstick assay. Most of the serum samples from the laboratory confirmed patients gave a moderate to strong staining intensity of the antigen band of the dipstick and were easy to read. The results demonstrate that the dipstick assay is convenient to use and allows the rapid and accurate confirmation of patients with clinical suspicion of leptospirosis in areas where the disease is endemic."

Despite this high incidence, the diagnosis is often delayed. The patient may then evolve to a severe form. This diagnostic delay is due to non-specific clinical symptoms in children. The most common symptoms are fever and digestive disorders (diarrhea, vomiting). In the absence of thrombocytopenia, the laboratory tests are not very useful for diagnosis. Parasitological examinations are dependent on the experience of the biologist, particularly in cases of low parasitemia as those observed in children who have received partial chemoprophylaxis. The recent introduction of rapid tests based on the detection of Plasmodium proteins, allows emergency remedy to this problem. The blood smears remains the gold standard and has to be used to confirm the results of rapid tests. If rapid tests improve the detection of Plasmodium in 2009, it remains mandatory to evoke the diagnosis of malaria in any febrile child coming from an endemic area."

There are many diagnostic kits to detect malaria infection. However, the sensitivity of these diagnostic kits remains a problem. To develop a diagnostic kit for malaria that has high sensitivity, it is necessary to produce monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) with high affinity. The present study was undertaken to produce hybridoma cells that can be used to generate McAbs with high affinity and specificity against Plasmodium vivax lactate dehydrogenase (pvLDH). In this study, BALB/c mice were immunized with purified recombinant polypeptides that encode pvLDH. McAbs against pvLDH were produced according to the protocol of hybridoma technique using myeloma cells (SP2/0 cell lines). The McAbs were characterized by isotyping and by Western blot analysis. Two McAbs (D2H and D7E) against pvLDH antigen were obtained. The isotypes of D2H and D7E were IgG2b. They recognize 33 kDa proteins that were defined as pvLDH by Western blot analysis. In the affinity test, D2H and D7E showed positively optical density value until each McAbs were serially diluted at concentrations of 0.156 and 0.078 μg/ml, respectively. To evaluate sensitivity and specificity against clinical specimens of P. vivax, purified McAbs were tested with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated monoclonal antibodies and blood samples (n = 180) of P. vivax patients using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, showing the 98% sensitivity. We suggest that McAbs produced in this study may be used for developing efficient and rapid diagnostic kits."

No doubt, the causes of the disappearance of malaria are complex. Certainly improved living conditions and life style; better medical and educational facilities in the wake of a rapid economic development could all have some role. On the other hand, the disappearance of malaria without large scale control operations could be ascribed to the two main factors: one is malaria case detection and simultaneous drug therapy available through the nation-wide passive case detection network during the 1960s and the other is rapidly improved farming practices begun in 1970s, which resulted in the use of a huge quantity of pesticides and other chemicals for agriculture, which, in turn, might affect local anopheline vectors which were originally not effective ones any way."

This test was conducted by the authors in the distribution areas of P. falciparum strains differing in the spectrum of drug resistance. Five hundred and forty-nine blood samples from febrile patients in Vietnam (n=84), Sierra Leone (n=41), Nigeria (n=14), Tanzania (n=8), Kenya (n=5), and Tadjikistan (n=397) were tested. Microscopy served as a primary control. Detection of P. falciparum DNA, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with included primers (nested PCR) of the most sensitive modification of PCR was a final control. The efficiency of the KAT-Quick P.f. test was estimated as a ratio of the number of its positive results to those of PCR. It was equal to 98-95%. The KAT-Quick P.f. test revealed no false-positive case associated with the genome of the parasite. The specificity of the test was determined as a ratio of the number of its negative (no P. falciparum) results to those of PCR. The blood samples from patients with vivax malaria and from those with nonmalarial fever were investigated. There was no cross reaction of the KAT-Quick P.f. test system for P. falciparum with that for P. vivax. The KAT-Quick P.f. test yielded no positive reaction with the blood from patients with non-malarial fever. Drug resistance depending on the spectrum of specific drugs caused its emergence may be determined by one or several mechanisms that are ultimately determined by one, the key mechanism. Thus, the findings suggest that multidrug resistance of P. falciparum does not trigger the occurrence of changes in its surface antigen--HRPII that is responsible for the efficiency of the KAT-Quick P.f. test. These may be also extrapolated to other rapid tests patterned after the same principle."

The aim of this assessment was to monitor and evaluate the quality of routine malaria diagnosis in Amazonas (Venezuela) and to improve the quality control system. The traditional non-blinded quality control system was found to be overburdened with diagnostic samples. A modified sampling system with fewer samples to be tested was proposed. Expert microscopists blindly double-checked 1000 slides and 550 rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) (OptiMAL-IT) from health posts (HP). For Plasmodium vivax, HP microscopy and OptiMAL-IT showed sensitivies of 86% and 63%, respectively. For P. falciparum, HP microscopy and OptiMAL-IT showed sensitivities of 68% and 89%, respectively. Both methods lost accuracy when fewer parasites occurred in the sample. HP microscopists from different municipalities displayed significant differences in diagnostic quality. Overall, quality of routine malaria diagnosis in the Venezuelan Amazon is good but not optimal. The change from the traditional non-blinded quality control system to blinded cross-checking of a minimal selection of samples is - comparatively - a low cost intervention with possibly high impact on the quality of routine malaria diagnosis. The introduction of RDTs should be discussed carefully in order not to displace an existing network of HP microscopists."

One hundred and thirty-six Yanomami patients were studied for the presence of malaria parasites. Thirty-three patients (24%) were positive for malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae). Twenty-one (64%) of the positive patients had <100 parasites/microl. Both RDTs showed poor sensitivity (24.2% for OptiMAL-IT) and 36.4% for FalciVax) but good specificity (99% both for OptiMAL-IT) and FalciVax). Field and laboratory microscopy showed sensitivities of 94% and 91%, respectively. The kappa coefficient was 0.90, indicating a high agreement between field and laboratory microscopy. We conclude that (i) adequate slide reading cannot be substituted by either of the two RDTs in the Venezuelan Amazon and (ii) the use of a light source such as that described above makes slide reading more feasible than hitherto in remote areas without electricity."

CD011431,0,18228564,0,Killer applications: toward affordable rapid cell-based diagnostics for malaria and tuberculosis.,"In many resource-poor areas, the HIV/AIDS epidemic coexists with epidemics of two much older diseases, malaria and tuberculosis, and the three diseases together kill approximately six million people per year. Although HIV/AIDS is treatable, but not curable, many if not most cases of malaria and tuberculosis (TB) can be cured if diagnosed correctly and promptly. The diagnosis of both malaria and TB is cell-based, typically made by microscopy of stained smears of blood (malaria) and sputum (TB). Cytometry has been shown to be effective for diagnosis of both conditions; however, conventional cytometers have been too complex and costly to be widely applied. It is likely that a newly developed small, simple, robust, inexpensive, energy-efficient low-resolution fluorescence image cytometer, employing a light-emitting diode for excitation and a megapixel digital camera chip for detection, could be used in resource-poor areas for malaria and TB diagnosis and for rapid (24-48 h) determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
CD011431,0,23373854,0,Malaria rapid diagnostic tests in travel medicine.,"Malaria is a serious condition in the non-immune traveller, and prognosis depends on timely diagnosis. Although microscopy remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are increasingly used in non-endemic settings. They are easy to use, provide results rapidly and require no specific training and equipment. Reported sensitivities vary between different RDT products but are generally good for Plasmodium falciparum, with RDTs detecting the P. falciparum antigen histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) scoring slightly better than P. falciparum-lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH)-detecting RDTs. Sensitivity is lower for Plasmodium vivax (66.0 - 88.0%) and poor for Plasmodium ovale (5.5 - 86.7%) and Plasmodium malariae (21.4 - 45.2%). Rapid diagnostic tests have several other limitations, including persistence of the PfHRP2 antigen, cross-reactions of P. falciparum with the non-falciparum test line and vice versa and (rare) false-positive reactions due to other infectious agents or immunological factors. False-negative results occur in the case of low parasite densities, prozone effect or pfhrp2 gene deletions. In addition, errors in interpretation occur, partly due to inadequacies in the instructions for use. Finally, RDTs do not give information about parasite density. In the diagnostic laboratory, RDTs are a valuable adjunct to (but not a replacement for) microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria in the returned traveller.In malaria endemic settings, special groups of travellers (those travelling for long periods, expatriates and short-stay frequent travellers) who are remote from qualified medical services may benefit from self-diagnosis by RDTs, provided they use correctly stored RDT products of proven accuracy, with comprehensive instructions for use and appropriate hands-on training."

The test threshold is the tradeoff between refraining and testing, the test-treatment threshold is the tradeoff between testing and treating. Only if the disease probability lies between the two should the test be used."
CD011431,0,14629768,0,Detection of malaria sporozoites by standard ELISA and VecTestTM dipstick assay in field-collected anopheline mosquitoes from a malaria endemic site in Ghana.,"We compared the VecTestTM dipstick assay for detection of Plasmodium sporozoites in Anopheles vectors of malaria with standard circumsporozoite (CS) microplate ELISA for detection of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) in Anopheles mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were collected from a malaria endemic site (Kassena Nankana district) in northern Ghana. Of 2620 randomly sampled mosquitoes tested, the standard CS-ELISA gave a sporozoite rate of 10.8% compared with 11.2% by VecTestTM, which was not statistically different (P = 0.66). Visual reading of the CS-ELISA results gave a sporozoite rate of 13.4%, which was higher than the other tests (P > 0.05). To allow a more objective evaluation of the sensitivity of the dipstick, an additional 136 known CS-ELISA-positive specimens were analysed. The prevalence of the test (including the additional samples) was 14.6% and 14.7% for CS-ELISA and dipstick, respectively (P > 0.05). The estimated prevalence by visual assessment of the CS-ELISA results was 17.5%. The relative specificity and sensitivity of the VecTestTM dipstick and visually read ELISA were estimated based on the CS-ELISA as a gold standard. The specificities of the dipstick and visual ELISA were high, 98.0% and 96.6%, respectively. However, the sensitivities of the two assays were 88.8% for VecTest and 100% for visual ELISA (P < 0.01). Concordance between VecTest and CS-ELISA was good (kappa = 0.86). Similarly, there was a good concordance between the dipstick and the visually read ELISA (kappa = 0.88). Extrapolating from PfCSP controls (titrated quantities of P. falciparum sporozoites), mean sporozoite loads of CS-ELISA-positive An. gambiae (286 +/- 28.05) and An. funestus (236 +/- 19.32) were determined (P = 0.146). The visual dipstick grades showed high correlation with sporozoite load. The more intense the dipstick colour, the higher the mean sporozoite load (+ = 108, ++ = 207, +++ = 290, r = 0.99, r2 = 1). The VecTest dipstick offers practical advantages for field workers needing rapid and accurate means of detection of sporozoites in mosquitoes."

CD011431,0,11719111,0,"A rapid, simple and sensitive flow cytometric system for detection of Plasmodium falciparum.","We have established a rapid, simple and sensitive flow cytometric system for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum that involves lysing erythrocytes and staining parasites at the same time using a newly developed hemolysing and staining solution containing dodecyl methyl ammonium chloride and acridine orange. In this system, freed parasites of P. falciparum could be plotted separately from erythrocyte ghosts, white blood cells and platelets on the two-dimensional scattergram of forward-angle light scatter and green fluorescence by flow cytometry with an argon laser. It took only 2-3 min per sample to obtain the scattergram and analyze the data, including the time of sample preparation for flow cytometric analysis. Sample preparation with this method does not require any difficult handling procedures. The threshold of parasite detection was almost equal to that of microscopic examination for cultured P. falciparum. The results of drug-susceptibility assays using this system were also almost identical to those obtained using microscopic examination. In this system, parasites at different erythrocytic stages could be easily distinguished. This system must prove useful and practical for basic laboratory studies of P. falciparum including those requiring the differential measurement of parasites at specific erythrocytic stages."

Severe deficiency was detected by the rapid test in 45 of 1126 volunteers in Indonesia and 54 of 1079 in Myanmar, but it was difficult to distinguish blood samples with mild deficiency from those with normal activity. 89 of 99 severely deficient cases were later confirmed by formazan ring method in the laboratory, but 5 with mild and 5 with no deficiency were misdiagnosed as severe. Of the samples diagnosed as mild and no deficiency on-site, none was found to be severely deficient by the formazan method. Malaria patients were simultaenously++ detected on-site in 273 samples on Halmahera island and 277 samples from Shan and Mon States. In Mon State, primaquine was prescribed safely to G6 PD-normal malaria patients infected with Plasmodium vivax and/or gametocytes of P. falciparum. The new rapid test for G6 PD deficiency may be useful for detecting severe cases under field conditions, and both rapid tests combined are can be useful in malaria-endemic areas, facilitating early diagnosis, prompt and radical treatment of malaria and suppression of malaria transmission."

CD011431,0,3208546,0,Pharmacokinetics of chlorproguanil in man after a single oral dose of Lapudrine.,"The pharmacokinetic parameters of chlorproguanil (Lapudrine) and its active metabolite, chlorcycloguanil, were determined in 6 healthy male volunteers after a single oral dose of 4 Lapudrine tables (80 mg). The mean maximum plasma chlorproguanil concentration was 36.7 +/- (SD) 7.9 ng/ml and was reached at 3.8 +/- 1.3 h. The chlorproguanil elimination half-life was 17.5 +/- 6.7 h and its plasma clearance was 1.28 +/- 0.12 l/h/kg. The mean whole blood to plasma ratio was 3.1 at 4 h after dosing. Chlorcycloguanil could not be quantified in plasma and whole blood at the detection limit of 10 ng/ml using a high-performance liquid chromatographic method. An excretion rate-time plot from urine data shows a rapid (t1/2 = 20 h) and a slow phase (t1/2 = 51 h) in the elimination of chlorcycloguanil. Our findings suggest that the current prophylactic regimen of chlorproguanil hydrochloride (20 mg weekly) may not be optimal in preventing infections with chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria."

Higher levels of clinical severity and chloroquine resistance are major factors responsible for such increases. Malarial glomerular injury is uncommon and mainly observed in Plasmodium malariae-infected patients. Occasionally, transient immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis is associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection. Coexistent crescentic glomerulonephritis and vivax malaria have not previously been reported. We report a fatal case of P. vivax malaria, who presented with acute renal failure. P. vivax monoinfection status was diagnosed with peripheral blood smear and rapid antigen test. Further evaluation for renal failure related to systemic illness and immunological markers were inconclusive. He was treated with antimalarial drugs, hemodialysis, and supportive therapy. Renal biopsy performed for nonrecovering renal failure reveled crescentic glomerulonephritis. This case highlights the need to thoroughly search for malaria-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis using renal biopsy after nonrecovering renal failure."

The method was used to determine parasite inhibition profiles and 50% inhibitory concentration values of known or potential antimalarial drugs. Values for parasite inhibition with known anti-malarial drugs using the PicoGreen assay were comparable with those determined by the standard method based upon the uptake of 3H-hypoxanthine and the Giemsa stain microscopic technique. The PicoGreen assay is rapid, sensitive, reproducible, easily interpreted, and ideally suited for screening of large numbers of samples for anti-malarial drug development."
CD011431,0,1406728,1,Colorimetric detection of Plasmodium falciparum and direct sequencing of amplified gene fragments using a solid phase method.,"A rapid colorimetric assay for the detection of DNA from Plasmodium falciparum malaria is described, allowing direct sequencing of amplified fragments in the positive samples. The method is based on amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with incorporation of biotin and a lac operator sequence in the amplified target DNA. The PCR product was immobilized on streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads, and detected by the specific binding of an Escherichia coli lac repressor beta-galactosidase fusion protein. Positive samples were subsequently treated with alkali to generate single stranded templates, which were used for solid phase genomic sequencing. As targets for amplification and sequencing we selected a region of the gene for the antigen Pf155/RESA and a region of the parasite dihydrofolate reductase gene (PfDHFR/TS). We show here that both of these gene targets can be used for specific detection of P. falciparum in patient blood samples. Genomic sequencing of five patient isolates revealed no variation in the Pf155/RESA gene fragment. In a comparison of this sequence with conserved protein domains, a marked similarity to the src homology region 3 was detected. A point mutation was found in the PfDHFR/TS gene fragment of one of the clinical samples, replacing Ser108 with Asn. This mutation has earlier been described in pyrimethamine and cycloguanile-resistant strains of P. falciparum."

CD011431,0,23199403,0,Diagnosing malaria in pregnancy: an update.,"Pregnancy malaria (PM) due to Plasmodium falciparum is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for women and their offspring, but is difficult to recognize and diagnose. During PM, parasites typically sequester in the placenta, whereas peripheral blood smears often appear negative. In addition, many infected women remain asymptomatic, especially in areas of high transmission where systemic immunity is high, although sequelae including maternal anemia and intrauterine growth retardation develop insidiously and increase mortality. New rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have shown promise for malaria diagnosis in nonpregnant individuals, including a product recently approved by the US FDA for use in the USA. However, the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for diagnosis of PM may be suboptimal. Here, we review the methods that are used to detect or diagnose PM, including blood smear microscopy, RDTs, PCR-based methods, and finally placental histology, which is often cited as the gold standard for use in research studies and clinical trials."

Rapid progress has been made in the study of protective antigens on the surface of sporozoites and it is likely that a family of analogous polypeptides occurs in several species of Plasmodium. New assays have been developed for the detection of these antigens and for the detection of infected mosquitos. Exoerythrocytic stages of several parasite species can be cultivated in vitro, providing an assay system for antibody and allowing the characterization of exoerythrocytic stage antigens. Progress has also been made in the identification of species- and stage-specific antigens of the asexual blood stages of rodent, simian, and human malaria parasites. In some instances, protective immunity has been shown to be directed against polypeptides (with a high relative molecular mass) synthesized at a late stage of schizont development. Messenger RNA (mRNA) species from P. knowlesi and P. yoelii have been successfully translated in vitro to give polypeptides with a high relative molecular mass (M(r)). Monoclonal antibodies have been used to identify and to purify important parasite antigens and purified P. yoelii antigens induced protective immunity. Monoclonal antibodies reactive with merozoite surface antigens have been used, as well as S-antigens, to distinguish between different isolates of P. falciparum. Recombinant DNA technology is being applied to Plasmodium: differences were found between repetitive DNA sequences from the genome of two isolates of P. falciparum; the genes for ribosomal RNA of P. falciparum and P. yoelii, and sequences homologous to the actin gene were identified in fragments of Plasmodium DNA cloned in prokaryotic vectors; by means of hybrid selection, complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were used to purify mRNAs encoding proteins of P. knowlesi of up to 100 000 M(r)."

A study was conducted to evaluate a rapid on-site immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria Pf/Pv) for detection of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax in two villages in the Taikkyi region of Myanmar. The ICT Malaria tests were performed by a volunteer health worker (VHW) in Yae-Aye-San village and by a professionally trained midwife (MW) in Kankone village. A total of 1000 symptomatic patients participated in the study by providing blood samples for an ICT test and for microscopy. The ICT performance indices, relative to microscopy, were better for the trained MW compared with the less experienced VHW. For P. falciparum and/or P. vivax infections, the sensitivities were 82.7% for the VHW compared with 93.7% for the MW. For P. falciparum infections, the sensitivities were 82.2% for the VHW and 91.3% for the MW, while the corresponding values for P. vivax infections were 66.7 and 79%, respectively. Although the test kit appeared to perform better in more experienced hands, this study questions whether this difference is related to the use of the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test kit, or related to other factors such as differences in the quality of blood slides prepared by the VHW and MW for microscopic examination. Overall, the results suggest that a rapid diagnostic assay such as the ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test kit can be used in rural settings by relatively inexperienced persons, such as VHWs, with a reasonable degree of sensitivity, thus providing on-site confirmation of symptomatic diagnosis of malaria."
CD011431,0,22089818,0,Gold nanoparticle-based fluorescence immunoassay for malaria antigen detection.,"The development of rapid detection assays for malaria diagnostics is an area of intensive research, as the traditional microscopic analysis of blood smears is cumbersome and requires skilled personnel. Here, we describe a simple and sensitive immunoassay that successfully detects malaria antigens in infected blood cultures. This homogeneous assay is based on the fluorescence quenching of cyanine 3B (Cy3B)-labeled recombinant Plasmodium falciparum heat shock protein 70 (PfHsp70) upon binding to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with an anti-Hsp70 monoclonal antibody. Upon competition with the free antigen, the Cy3B-labeled recombinant PfHsp70 is released to solution resulting in an increase of fluorescence intensity. Two types of AuNP-antibody conjugates were used as probes, one obtained by electrostatic adsorption of the antibody on AuNPs surface and the other by covalent bonding using protein cross-linking agents. In comparison with cross-linked antibodies, electrostatic adsorption of the antibodies to the AuNPs surfaces generated conjugates with increased activity and linearity of response, within a range of antigen concentration from 8.2 to 23.8 μg.mL(-1). The estimated LOD for the assay is 2.4 μg.mL(-1) and the LOQ is 7.3 μg.mL(-1). The fluorescence immunoassay was successfully applied to the detection of antigen in malaria-infected human blood cultures at a 3% parasitemia level, and is assumed to detect parasite densities as low as 1,000 parasites.μL(-1)."

Patients were kept for 28 days in a transmission-free hospital in an area with chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria to prevent reinfection and to aid diagnosis of recrudescence. Progress and possible adverse effects were monitored by blood film parasitology, blood biochemistry assays, urinalysis, ECG and X-ray. Ninety-eight of the 102 patients were shown to be free of infection at 28 days, a 96.1% cure rate. Parasite reduction at 24 hours was 99.4%. Time to effect complete parasite clearance ranged from 24 to 54 hours (median 30 hours). Time for fever clearance ranged from 6 to 78 hours (median 18 hours). Recrudescence was low (3.9%). No significant adverse side-effects were encountered.

Oral artesunate was absorbed rapidly with a mean time to peak plasma bioactivity of 1.7 h (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.8-2.6). There was wide variation in peak plasma concentrations with a mean value equivalent to 664 ng of dihydroartemisinin/mL (95% CI 387-9410, range 179-1395) and a four-fold variation in the area under the plasma concentration-time curves. Elimination from plasma was rapid with a mean (95% CI) half-life of 1.0 h (95% CI 0.8-1.4).

The present study compares the utility of four laboratory diagnostic methods viz. IgM capture ELISA, an in house reverse transcription PCR for the diagnosis of Chikungunya fever, TaqMan real-time PCR, and a one step reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP). Out of the 70 serum samples tested, 29 (41%) were positive for Chikungunya IgM antibody by ELISA and 50 (71%) samples were positive by one of the three molecular assays. CHIKV specific nucleic acid was detected in 33/70 (47%) by reverse transcription PCR, 46/70 (66%) by TaqMan real-time PCR, and 43/70 (62%) by RT-LAMP assay. A majority of the samples (62/70; 89%) were positive by at least one of the four assays used in the study. The molecular assays were more sensitive for diagnosis in the early stages of illness (2-5 days post onset) when antibodies were not detectable. In the later stages of illness, the IgM ELISA is a more sensitive diagnostic test. In conclusion we recommend that the IgM ELISA be used as an initial screening test followed one of the molecular assays in samples that are collected in the early phase of illness and negative for CHIKV IgM antibodies. Such as approach would enable rapid confirmation of the diagnosis and implementation of public health measures especially during outbreaks."
CD011431,0,20670289,0,Economic evaluation of point-of-care diagnostic technologies for infectious diseases.,"We review the growing number of economic evaluations of individual point-of-care (POC) tests for diagnosis of infectious diseases in resource-limited settings that use either cohort studies or mathematical models. We focus on studies that evaluate POC diagnostic tests for the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria, tools that are central to the WHO prevention guidelines for infectious diseases in developing countries. Although rapid diagnostic tests for HIV and malaria seem to be cost-effective in these standard analyses, these do not take into account the reduction in patients' waiting time and the number of clinic visits required to receive results, or future benefits from the reduction in antimalarial drug pressure. Those additional cost reductions would be considerably greater with POC rapid tests, and the cost-effectiveness of POC tests would therefore be improved. Findings from cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that, despite the relatively small additional cost incurred, decision-makers should strongly consider using POC tests throughout or during parts of HIV and malaria epidemics, where this is feasible in terms of local human resources and logistical conditions."
CD011431,0,20670288,0,Point-of-care tests for diagnosing infections in the developing world.,"Infectious diseases continue to cause an enormous burden of death and disability in developing countries. Increasing access to appropriate treatment for infectious diseases could have a major impact on disease burden. Some common infections can be managed syndromically without the need for diagnostic tests, but this is not appropriate for many infectious diseases, in which a positive diagnostic test is needed before treatment can be given. Since many people in developing countries do not have access to laboratory services, diagnosis depends on the availability of point of care (POC) tests. Historically there has been little investment in POC tests for diseases that are common in developing countries, but that is now changing. Lack of regulation of diagnostic tests in many countries has resulted in the widespread use of sub-standard POC tests, especially for malaria, making it difficult for manufacturers of reliable POC tests to compete. In recent years increased investment, technological advances, and greater awareness about the importance of reliable diagnostic tests has resulted in rapid progress. Rapid, reliable and affordable POC tests, requiring no equipment and minimal training, are now available for HIV infection, syphilis and malaria, but POC tests for other infections are urgently needed. Many countries do not have established criteria for licensing and introducing new diagnostic tests, and many clinicians in developing countries have become disillusioned with diagnostic tests and prefer to rely on clinical judgment. Continuing advocacy and training in the use of POC tests are needed, and systems for quality control of POC tests need to be developed if they are to achieve their maximum potential."

CD011431,0,20670287,0,Routine use of point-of-care tests: usefulness and application in clinical microbiology.,"Point-of-care (POC) tests offer potentially substantial benefits for the management of infectious diseases, mainly by shortening the time to result and by making the test available at the bedside or at remote care centres. Commercial POC tests are already widely available for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections and for parasitic diseases, including malaria. Infectious diseases specialists and clinical microbiologists should be aware of the indications and limitations of each rapid test, so that they can use them appropriately and correctly interpret their results. The clinical applications and performance of the most relevant and commonly used POC tests are reviewed. Some of these tests exhibit insufficient sensitivity, and should therefore be coupled to confirmatory tests when the results are negative (e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes rapid antigen detection test), whereas the results of others need to be confirmed when positive (e.g. malaria). New molecular-based tests exhibit better sensitivity and specificity than former immunochromatographic assays (e.g. Streptococcus agalactiae detection). In the coming years, further evolution of POC tests may lead to new diagnostic approaches, such as panel testing, targeting not just a single pathogen, but all possible agents suspected in a specific clinical setting. To reach this goal, the development of serology-based and/or molecular-based microarrays/multiplexed tests will be needed. The availability of modern technology and new microfluidic devices will provide clinical microbiologists with the opportunity to be back at the bedside, proposing a large variety of POC tests that will allow quicker diagnosis and improved patient care."
CD011431,0,12932092,1,Rapid diagnostic devices for malaria: field evaluation of a new prototype immunochromatographic assay for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and non-falciparum Plasmodium.,"The NOW ICT Malaria P.f./P.v. for Whole Blood (Binax, Inc., Portland, ME) is a new malaria rapid diagnostic device that represents a technical advance over previous assays, such as ICT Malaria P.f./P.v. and ICT Malaria P.f.. We evaluated this device in March 2001 in symptomatic patients at malaria clinics in Maesod, Thailand. Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears was the reference standard. In 246 patients, microscopy showed 32 (13.0%) infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 63 (25.6%) with P. vivax, 6 (2.4%) with mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax, 5 (2.0%) with P. malariae, and 140 (56.9%) negative. Sensitivity for P. falciparum was 100% and specificity was 96.2% (200 of 208; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 92-98). For P. vivax, sensitivity was 87.3% (55 of 63; 95% CI = 77-93) and specificity was 97.7% (173 of 177; 95% CI = 95-99), but all the four false-positive results were microscopically positive for P. malariae; thus, specificity for non-falciparum Plasmodium was 100%. These results suggest improved performance over NOW ICT predecessors."
CD011431,0,22099005,0,Adherence to artemether/lumefantrine treatment in children under real-life situations in rural Tanzania.,"A follow-up study was conducted to determine the magnitude of and factors related to adherence to artemether/lumefantrine (ALu) treatment in rural settings in Tanzania. Children in five villages of Kilosa District treated at health facilities were followed-up at their homes on Day 7 after the first dose of ALu. For those found to be positive using a rapid diagnostic test for malaria and treated with ALu, their caretakers were interviewed on drug administration habits. In addition, capillary blood samples were collected on Day 7 to determine lumefantrine concentrations. The majority of children (392/444; 88.3%) were reported to have received all doses, in time. Non-adherence was due to untimeliness rather than missing doses and was highest for the last two doses. No significant difference was found between blood lumefantrine concentrations among adherent (median 286 nmol/l) and non-adherent [median 261 nmol/l; range 25 nmol/l (limit of quantification) to 9318 nmol/l]. Children from less poor households were more likely to adhere to therapy than the poor [odds ratio (OR)=2.45, 95% CI 1.35-4.45; adjusted OR=2.23, 95% CI 1.20-4.13]. The high reported rate of adherence to ALu in rural areas is encouraging and needs to be preserved to reduce the risk of emergence of resistant strains. The age-based dosage schedule and lack of adherence to ALu treatment guidelines by health facility staff may explain both the huge variability in observed lumefantrine concentrations and the lack of difference in concentrations between the two groups."
CD011431,0,19583909,0,Blood banking in a malaria-endemic area: evaluating the problem posed by malarial parasitaemias.,"The emergence and wide dissemination of drug-resistant malarial parasites underscore the need to prevent post-transfusion malaria. In Nigeria, as in most of sub-Saharan Africa, however, blood donors are not routinely screened for malarial infection. Recently, 391 consecutive potential blood donors in a malaria-endemic area of south-western Nigeria were each checked for malarial parasitaemia using three methods: microscopy (all samples), OptiMAL (315 samples) and/or the Clinotech Malaria Cassette (142 samples). OptiMAL detects parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase whereas the Clinotech test detects the surface proteins of merozoites and sporozoites. Microscopy revealed parasitaemias in 79 (20.2%) of the potential donors, the levels of parasitaemia varying from 34 to 6289 asexual parasites/microl (mean=445/microl). The prevalence of malarial parasitaemia, as detected by microscopy, was significantly higher during the rainy season than in the dry season (27.3% v. 5.5%; P<0.0001). There was no significant association between patent parasitaemia and fever (i.e. an axillary temperature > or =37.5 degrees C), blood group, gender or anaemia. The corresponding prevalences of malarial parasitaemia detected using the rapid diagnostic tests were 3.8% (12/315) for OptiMAL and 57.8% (82/142) for the Clinotech. With the results of the microscopy used as the 'gold standard', OptiMAL gave a sensitivity of only 16.0% but a specificity of 98.5%. The corresponding values for the Clinotech tests were 69.2% and 50.0%, respectively. It would clearly be beneficial to include screening for malaria parasitaemia in the routine investigation of potential blood donors in Nigeria, especially during the rainy season, when the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria appears relatively high."

CD011431,0,18817574,0,Evidence of increasing Leu-Phe knockdown resistance mutation in Anopheles gambiae from Niger following a nationwide long-lasting insecticide-treated nets implementation.,"At the end of 2005, a nationwide long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) distribution targeting the most vulnerable populations was implemented throughout Niger. A large number of studies in Africa have reported the existence of anopheline populations resistant to various insecticides, partly due to knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations, but few operational wide-scale control programmes were coupled with the monitoring of such mutations. The distribution of the kdr-west (kdr-w) Leu-Phe mutation was studied in Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations from Niger and temporal variations were monitored following the nationwide LLIN implementation."
CD011431,0,18375970,0,"Possible risk factors for congenital malaria at a tertiary care hospital in Sagamu, Ogun State, South-West Nigeria.","Congenital malaria, defined as the presence of malaria parasites in the erythrocytes of newborns aged <7 days, was considered rare in endemic areas until recent studies started reporting high prevalence rates. Various theories have been postulated to explain this phenomenon, but they are not proven conclusively from research. Against this background, a prospective study was designed with the following objectives. To determine the prevalence of congenital malaria parasitaemia and identify possible risk factors amongst newborns delivered in O.O.U.T.H Sagamu, Ogun State. Over a 6-month period, 192 live newborns and their mothers were consecutively recruited into the study. Within 3 days of life, neonatal peripheral blood samples were collected for malaria screening by blood film microscopy and detection of plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) with the OptiMAL Rapid Malaria Test kit. Maternal peripheral blood samples were taken simultaneously, to check for malaria infestation by blood film microscopy, and questionnaires were administered on the mothers to identify possible factors associated with the development of neonatal parasitaemia. Neonatal clinical and laboratory data were recorded in a pro forma designed for the study. Data analysis was done with Epi-info version 6 software and level of significance set at <5%. Twenty-one of 192 newborns delivered in O.O.U.T.H within the study period were diagnosed as having congenital malaria by blood film microscopy, giving a prevalence rate of 10.9%. The main identified innate neonatal risk factor for congenital malaria parasitaemia was prematurity. First-order pregnancy, history of fever within 3 months of delivery and peripheral parasitaemia at delivery (p < 0.001) were the variables that were significantly higher in the mothers of the parasitemic newborns. We conclude that congenital malaria parasitaemia in tropical endemic areas is not rare. Pre-term neonates, infants of primigravidae, women with history of fever within 3 months of delivery and women with post-partum peripheral parasitaemia may benefit from routine screening for malaria."
CD011431,0,18589463,1,"Monitoring malaria control in Khammouane province, Laos: an active case detection survey of Plasmodium falciparum malaria using the Paracheck rapid diagnostic test.","In Khammouane province, Laos, over 5000 slide-positive malaria cases were reported at local health facilities in 1997. To combat the spread of malaria, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and community health education were provided to the people in this province by the Lao Ministry of Health and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. In order to document the current malaria situation, an active case detection (ACD) survey using rapid diagnostic tests was conducted at 23 sites from June to July, the rainy season, in 2005. A total of 1711 villagers from 403 households participated in the survey. The proportion of positive cases was 0.7% (12/1711) with a range in each village of 0-8.2%. The low infection rate observed in this ACD survey was consistent with the decrease in the number of slide-positive malaria cases at local health facilities (from over 5000 cases to 536 cases), indicating the substantial progress made in malaria control. Although the reduction of malaria cases can be attributed to multiple factors, continued promotion of the proper use of ITNs as well as community-based testing and treatment services, especially in remote areas, may lead to a further reduction of malaria cases in the province."
CD011431,0,15869776,0,Positive control wells: a potential answer to remote-area quality assurance of malaria rapid diagnostic tests.,"Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are a potential breakthrough in the provision of accurate diagnosis in remote areas, but widescale use is hampered by uncertainty over accuracy under field conditions. Positive control wells, which contain recombinant malaria parasite antigen, are a novel method for addressing this need for quality assurance. The potential of a commercially available positive control well, reconstituted with blood, was assessed for use in routine monitoring of RDT sensitivity in a remote malaria-endemic region. When maintained at 4 degrees C, the wells produced a consistent level of parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigen activity, as detected by pLDH-detecting RDTs, but activity reduced after cumulative exposure to temperatures likely to be encountered over a few months in a malaria-endemic area. This limitation was successfully overcome in the field through centralized, controlled storage. Monitoring of RDT sensitivity was successfully incorporated into routine supervisory visits to remote clinics. However, improved temperature stability of the wells would enhance their potential. The threshold at which the wells' signal reduced RDT sensitivity requires further investigation. The wells show potential to overcome an important obstacle to the wide implementation of accurate parasite-based diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Further assessment of their place in malaria management is warranted."
