CD011126,0,20210525,0,Retained fetal bones masquerading as an intrauterine device with missing threads.,"We present the case of a 26-year-old woman with retained fetal bones, discovered eight years after an induced mid-trimester abortion in a West African country. The patient had requested her general practitioner to change the intrauterine device (IUD) which she assumed had been inserted immediately post-abortion. No threads were seen on vaginal examination. A pelvic ultrasound examination showed features that were misinterpreted for an IUD in the cervical canal. At evacuation of the uterine cavity retained fetal bone fragments were recovered."

CD011126,0,24357397,0,Metformin reduces TGF-β1-induced extracellular matrix production in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTS: Metformin is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is thought to be the target that mediates its effects. Recently, it has been demonstrated that metformin has antifibrotic effects beyond its antihyperglycemic action. The purposes of this study were to investigate the effect of metformin on TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation (α-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA]) and extracellular matrix (ECM) production and to determine the underlying mechanism of the action of metformin in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDFs)."

CD011126,0,23090468,0,Cesarean scar imaging and prediction of subsequent obstetric complications.,"It has long been hoped that cesarean hysterotomy scar imaging data could predict obstetric complications in subsequent pregnancies with sufficient precision to be used for clinical decision-making. Although large visualized defects in nonpregnant uteri, and thinning of the lower uterine segment late in subsequent pregnancies, may be associated with increased risk of uterine rupture, the paucity of available clinical correlation data still preclude any clinical utility. There is an ongoing need for prospective adequately powered registries that include clinical factors related to the previous cesarean deliveries that can inform subsequent practice decisions."
CD011126,0,18581162,0,Transitional cell carcinoma of upper urinary tract vs. benign lesions: distinctive MSCT features.,"The transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the upper urinary tract is relatively uncommon. The clinical presentation of TCCs and many other diseases of the upper urinary tract are nonspecific, and most of these lesions are usually necessary to be evaluated by computed tomography (CT) urography. CT appearances of TCCs can be classified as papillary, infiltrating papillary, and diffusely infiltrating tumor. Most TCCs of the upper urinary tract can be identified on the bases of characteristic CT appearances. However, some benign lesions may mimic different categories of TCCs and should be taken into account for differentiating diagnosis. These lesions include endometriosis, nephrogenic adenoma, mycetomas, malacoplakia, and inflammatory pseudotumor which are similar to infiltrating papillary TCCs; complex urolithiasis, passed stone of ureter and ureteropelvic junction, chronic ureteropelvic junction obstruction with superimposed infection, atypical pyelonephritis, and tuberculosis which mimic diffusely infiltrating TCCs, and fibroepithelial polyp which has the same CT appearances as papillary TCCs. The useful CT signs to make differential diagnosis involve enhanced pattern, location of lesion, induration of urinary tract, and range of thickening of urinary wall. The three-dimension (3D) reconstructed images is useful in making differential diagnosis."

CD011126,0,17146747,0,Are they spherules of ovarian cystic teratoma or daughter cysts of echinococcosis?,"Teratoma is a germ cell tumour which accounts for approximately 15-20 % of all ovarian cancers. The tumour is possibly derived from ectodermal differentiation of totipotent cells or mitotic germ cells. We present a case of a 37-year-old female patient with multiple spherical structures floating in a large pelvic-abdominal cystic mass seen on sonographic images. A giant echinococcal cyst gravid with its daughters was the presumed preoperative sonographic diagnosis. The patient underwent excision of the lesion, and the pathological diagnosis was teratoma. The striking feature of multiple spherical structures in the cyst was caused by multiple spherules of a mature ovarian cystic teratoma which were representing numerous mobile sebaceous cysts and desquamative keratin formations."

The precise developmental mechanisms leading to cryptorchidism are poorly understood; however, abnormalities in both functional anatomic and hormonal factors during embryogenesis and testicular descent are implicated. Although surgical intervention is ultimately required, there is a defined role for diagnostic imaging in patient evaluation-particularly in the setting of a nonpalpable undescended testis. Consultation among urologists, pediatric surgeons, and radiologists is paramount to optimize patient care."

CD011126,0,22182054,0,Menometrorrhagia during the premenopause: an overview.,"Menometrorrhagia, defined as excessive and prolonged uterine bleeding occurring at irregular and/or frequent intervals, occurs in up to 24% of women aged 40-50 years. There are a wide range of causes of menometrorrhagia, although histological differences in endometrium between women aged <45 years compared with those aged 48-50 years indicate a much higher prevalence of myomas, adenomyosis, and dysfunctional endometrium (dysfunctional uterine bleeding, hyperplasia, neoplasia) around the time of the premenopause, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis and appropriate management in women of this age group. In women presenting with menometrorrhagia, it is imperative to recognize that underlying lesions and diagnosis are frequently missed due to multiple causes. Primary diagnosis needs to exclude pregnancy and cancer, whereas secondary investigations (including ultrasound with instillation of saline solution, hysteroscopy and biopsy, and magnetic resonance imaging) can assist in accurately diagnosing the underlying cause of menometrorrhagia."

CD011126,0,19325062,0,Nipple-areolar complex: normal anatomy and benign and malignant processes.,"The nipple-areolar complex may be affected by many normal variations in embryologic development and breast maturation as well as by abnormal processes of a benign or malignant nature. Benign processes that may affect the nipple-areolar complex include eczema, duct ectasia, periductal mastitis, adenomas, papillomas, leiomyomas, and abscesses; malignant processes include Paget disease, lymphoma, and invasive and noninvasive breast cancers. Radiologists should be aware of the best methods for evaluating each of these entities: Many disorders of the nipple-areolar complex are unique or differ in important ways from those that occur elsewhere in the breast, and they require a diagnostically specific imaging evaluation. Patients may present with benign developmental variations; inversion, retraction, or enlargement of the nipple, which may have either a benign or a malignant cause; a palpable mass; nipple discharge; skin changes in and around the nipple; infection with resultant nipple changes or a subareolar mass; or abnormal findings at routine mammographic screening. Further diagnostic imaging may include repeat mammography, breast ultrasonography, galactography, and magnetic resonance imaging. When skin changes are present, a clinical evaluation by the patient's primary care physician, dermatologist, or surgeon should be part of the diagnostic work-up."

Case report].,"We report the case of a pregnancy of 16 weeks with anemia and a presumptive diagnosis of partial mole. In secondary care this diagnosis was ruled out through ultrasonography and diffuse cysts were found in the myometrium. Spectral Doppler ultrasound showed no flow, but it could be observed with power angiography. Cesarean section was performed at 38 weeks and hysterectomy 24 hours after because of intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Power angiography, spectral Doppler and serum human chorionic gonadotropin are the most useful diagnostic tools in the differential diagnosis of diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the uterus. Postpartum hemorrhage is a likely complication."
CD011126,0,25251089,0,"A comprehensive newborn exam: part II. Skin, trunk, extremities, neurologic.","Skin findings are common during the newborn examination. Although these findings are often benign, it is important to visualize the entire skin surface to distinguish these findings and appropriately reassure parents. The chest should be observed for symmetric movement, pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum, prominent xiphoid, or breast tissue. The infant should be as relaxed as possible so that the physician can more easily detect any abdominal masses, which are often renal in origin. A single umbilical artery may be associated with another congenital abnormality, especially renal anomalies, and intrauterine growth restriction and prematurity. Signs of ambiguous genitalia include clitoromegaly and fused labia in girls, and bilateral undescended testes, a micropenis, or a bifid scrotum in boys. Sacral dimples do not warrant further evaluation if they are less than 0.5 cm in diameter, are located within 2.5 cm of the anal verge, and are not associated with cutaneous markers; dimples that do not fit these criteria require ultrasonography to evaluate for spinal dysraphism. Brachial plexus injuries are most common in newborns who are large for gestational age, and physical therapy may be required to achieve normal function. Patients with abnormal findings on Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers should be evaluated further for hip dysplasia. It is also important to assess newborns for tone and confirm the presence of normal primitive reflexes."
CD011126,0,15154382,0,Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: update.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. GIST have characteristic morphological features and are positive for KIT (CD117). Overexpression of KIT in the tumor cells results from constitutive activation of the KIT tyrosine kinase receptor. KIT activation leads to intracellular signaling that causes increased cellular proliferation and enhanced cell survival leading to tumor formation. A successful therapeutic strategy is available with the pharmacological agent SCI.-571 that blocks the intracellular effects of KIT activation. GIST are more common in the stomach (60-70%) and the small intestine (25-35%), with a minority of lesions occurring in the colon, rectum, appendix and esophagus. GIST differ histologically, immunohistochemically and genetically from leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas and schwannomas. The pathologist plays an important role in the evaluation of these lesions. Adequate gross and microscopic pathological evaluation are crucial in the determination of treatment and prognosis."

CD011126,0,16829471,0,The use of MRI in planning radiotherapy for gynaecological tumours.,"Parameters that significantly influence results in radiation treatment of gynaecological malignancies are mainly related to the tumour characteristics and the radiotherapy technique used. High-dose radiotherapy requires accurate localisation of the tumour volume and its relationship to surrounding normal tissues. For many years the standard technique used for irradiation of the pelvic area was the four-field box technique which offered the potential benefit of the lateral fields to shield the rectum and small bowel. However, this conventional technique was designed according to bony landmarks and offered limited information regarding the topography of the tumour and the flexion of the uterus which are influenced by the tumour burden and bladder and rectal filling. CT and MRI enable the visualisation of the cervix, uterus, vagina, iliac vessels and organs at risk, but MRI allows tumour depiction in all planes. In the early 1990s, several studies reported on the value of pelvic MRI in designing the lateral fields of the box technique. They demonstrated that conventional lateral portals would have resulted in a marginal tumour miss and incomplete coverage of the uterine fundus in more than 50% of cases, thus leading to the conclusion that if a box technique is used its design should be based on sagittal MRI. CT-based 3D planning systems are now routinely used in the vast majority of radiotherapy departments. Target volumes and organs at risk are delineated by the physician on each CT slice in order to conform the radiotherapy fields to the tumour volume. For several reasons, such as distortion and lack of electron density which is essential for dose calculation, the implementation of MRI into radiation treatment planning has its limitations. However, MRI can still be used if planning systems integrate tools for CT/MR image registration. There is little experience in the literature for gynaecological malignancies demonstrating that image fusion allows an improvement of the definition of the target and the organ at risk compared to CT alone. Only a few papers in the literature report on the use of CT/MR image registration in planning the external irradiation of gynaecological tumours. Most demonstrate feasibility, but they fail to quantify the improvement for volume definition compared to the use of CT alone. Finally, recent possibilities offered by MRI technology are promising in the area of brachytherapy planning as the full potential of individually defining and evaluating GTV and CTV based on tumour extent and anatomical structures is exploited."

CD011126,0,21646038,0,An integrated approach to segmentation and nonrigid registration for application in image-guided pelvic radiotherapy.,"External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) has become the preferred options for nonsurgical treatment of prostate cancer and cervix cancer. In order to deliver higher doses to cancerous regions within these pelvic structures (i.e. prostate or cervix) while maintaining or lowering the doses to surrounding non-cancerous regions, it is critical to account for setup variation, organ motion, anatomical changes due to treatment and intra-fraction motion. In previous work, manual segmentation of the soft tissues is performed and then images are registered based on the manual segmentation. In this paper, we present an integrated automatic approach to multiple organ segmentation and nonrigid constrained registration, which can achieve these two aims simultaneously. The segmentation and registration steps are both formulated using a Bayesian framework, and they constrain each other using an iterative conditional model strategy. We also propose a new strategy to assess cumulative actual dose for this novel integrated algorithm, in order to both determine whether the intended treatment is being delivered and, potentially, whether or not a plan should be adjusted for future treatment fractions. Quantitative results show that the automatic segmentation produced results that have an accuracy comparable to manual segmentation, while the registration part significantly outperforms both rigid and nonrigid registration. Clinical application and evaluation of dose delivery show the superiority of proposed method to the procedure currently used in clinical practice, i.e. manual segmentation followed by rigid registration."

Included are disorders of cervical, ovarian, fallopian tube, and uterine origin. We also discuss the role of various imaging modalities including hysterosalpingography, pelvic ultrasonography, hysterosonography, and pelvic MR imaging in elucidating the cause of female infertility. Radiologists need to know the conditions to be aware of when these patients are sent for diagnostic imaging, as well as how to direct further management, if necessary, should an abnormality be detected."
CD011126,0,19243746,0,Cervical mucus status can be accurately estimated by transvaginal ultrasound during fertility evaluation.,"Examinations of the cervical mucus for determining its quantity and physical characteristics are used to provide a clinical marker for the timing of ovulation. We propose that transvaginal ultrasound, which is routinely used as a tool for monitoring follicular growth in patients undergoing ovulation induction, might also be used simultaneously for estimating cervical mucus measurements. With no additional effort or expense, these data may help to optimize individual patient management."

Currently, there is no structural information on the membrane-embedded OT complex, which consists of eight different polypeptide chains. We report a 12 A resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of OT from yeast. We mapped the locations of four essential OT subunits through a maltose-binding protein fusion strategy. OT was found to have a large domain in the lumenal side of endoplasmic reticulum where the catalysis occurs. The lumenal domain mainly comprises the catalytic Stt3p, the donor substrate-recognizing Wbp1p, and the acceptor substrate-recognizing Ost1p. A prominent groove was observed between these subunits, and we propose that the nascent polypeptide from the translocon threads through this groove while being scanned by the Ost1p subunit for the presence of the glycosylation sequon."
CD011126,0,17505940,0,Sonographic assessment of ovarian reserve. Its correlation with outcome of in vitro fertilization cycles.,"Ovarian reserve is a crucial factor for normal ovarian response and the achievement of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF). Recently, the study of morphological markers by means of ultrasonographic counting of antral follicles (AFC) has proved useful. The present prospective study included 327 consecutive IVF patients who had a basal ultrasound scan of their ovarian reserve during the early follicular phase and had a first IVF cycle between 1 and 3 months later. We performed 313 ovum pick-ups with a mean of 11.1 +/- 7.9 oocytes retrieved. The pregnancy rate per aspiration was 34.5%. Clear and significant differences were observed between normal and low response with respect to AFC, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level and age. We also found that AFC correlated negatively and significantly with age, FSH and LH, and positively and also significantly with the total number of follicles, estradiol level and the number of oocytes retrieved. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the cut-off value of AFC for poor response was 7 follicles. The value of AFC for predicting pregnancy was lower, although patients with AFC of 8 or more follicles obtained significantly higher pregnancy rates. We consider that AFC should be included in the study of the infertile patient."
CD011126,0,22170796,0,An unusual presentation of acquired hypothyroidism: the Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome.,"The association in young females of long-standing primary hypothyroidism, isosexual precocious pseudopuberty and multicystic enlarged ovaries was first described in 1960 by Van Wyk and Grumbach. Since then, sporadic case reports have contributed to clarifying the key features of this syndrome. The unique elements that lead to this diagnosis are FSH-dominated sexual precocity combined with a delayed bone age in the presence of hypothyroidism. It is important to recognise this syndrome because initiating simple thyroid hormone replacement completely resolves symptoms and hormone abnormalities, avoiding unnecessary investigations for malignancies or surgical intervention. We describe an 8-year-old girl with autoimmune thyroiditis and severe long-standing hypothyroidism presenting with the clinical features of Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome, a secondary TSH-secreting adenoma and hyperprolactinaemia. In addition, this girl presented with microcytic anaemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and two unusual features - a newly developed streaky hyperpigmented skin lesion and parathyroid hormone suppression despite vitamin D deficiency. Thyroxine replacement normalised all hormone abnormalities and shrunk the pituitary adenoma within 9 months, but the new skin lesion persisted. We review the literature and explore the pathophysiology of known and new features that give rise to speculation indicating stimulation of the FSH G protein-coupled receptor by excessive TSH, but LH suppression by hyperprolactinaemia."

It is estimated that the magnitude of the problem might be even larger in developing countries, including those in the Middle East. Although several organizations and countries have developed or adapted guidelines to their local needs, as of today there are no guidelines for osteoporosis assessment in the Middle East. In April 2002, a panel of osteoporosis experts met and discussed practice guidelines for osteoporosis assessment and treatment in Lebanon. The process, which involved an overview of international guidelines as well as local data on osteoporosis, resulted in a draft for Lebanese guidelines that addressed three main questions: ""Who to test?"" ""What measures to use?"" and ""When to treat?"".

CD011126,0,18781175,0,Silent venous thromboembolism before treatment in endometrial cancer and the risk factors.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often occurs after surgery and can even occur before surgery in patients with gynaecological malignancies. We investigated the incidence of VTE before treatment of endometrial cancer and associated risk factors. Plasma D-dimer (DD) levels before initial treatment were examined in 171 consecutive patients with endometrial cancer. Venous ultrasound imaging (VUI) of the lower extremities was performed in patients with DD >or=1.5 microg ml(-1), as the negative predictive value of DD for VTE is extremely high. For patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary scintigraphy was performed to ascertain the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Risk factors for VTE were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses for 171 patients. Of these, 37 patients (21.6%) showed DD >or=1.5 microg ml(-1), 17 (9.9%) displayed DVT by VUI and 8 (4.7%) showed PTE on pulmonary scintigraphy. All patients with VTE were asymptomatic. Univariate analysis for various risk factors revealed older age, non-endometrioid histology and several variables of advanced disease as significantly associated with VTE before treatment. Obesity, smoking and diabetes mellitus were not risk factors. Multivariate analysis confirmed extrauterine spread and non-endometrioid histology as independently and significantly associated with risk of VTE. These data suggest that silent or subclinical VTE occurs before treatment in at least around 10% of patients with endometrial cancer. Risk factors for VTE before treatment might not be identical to those after starting treatment."

We propose a physiological range of pubic-urethral distance under stress in young women between 10 and 15 mm, the inclination angle of the urethral axis is between 60 and 100 degrees . In peri-post-menopause women we establish a non-rigid range of mobility in relation to age and parity: between 15 and 18 mm for the pubis-urethra distance and 80 degrees and 120 degrees for the angle of the urethral axis. Defining a range of normality for urethral mobility through ultrasound is useful for further studying therapeutic choices and help to identify the surgical correction and post-operative follow-up."

Undrained collection of pus is associated with persistent fever. Hysterectomy has been classically suggested as a safe option to treat this kind of lesion. We present the case of a patient who presented an abscess in the cesarean section scar tissue 6 years after the surgery. The myometrium covering the abscess was almost absent. This lesion was first managed with antibiotic therapy and ultrasound-guided aspiration. After failure of the initial therapy, this situation was managed by hysteroscopic fulguration of the capsule under laparoscopic control. For patients with abscesses spreading into the uterine cavity, endoscopic management is a feasible and safe intervention that may be offered to the patient after a correct evaluation."

Gynecological examination revealed marked hysterauxesis without tenderness with a high HCG level. CT examination led to the misdiagnosis of trophoblastic tumor with lymph node metastasis of the left iliac vessels. The patient underwent subsequent laparotomy, and a huge pelvic hematoma with maximum diameter of 20 cm was found, for which left salpingectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen supported the diagnosis of old tubal pregnancy. This case represents a rare clinical entity of old ectopic pregnancy manifested as a painless huge pelvic mass that can be easily misdiagnosed based on radiographical findings only."
CD011126,0,19896616,0,Isolated endometriosis on the rectus abdominis muscle in women without a history of abdominal surgery: a rare and intriguing finding.,"We report 2 rare cases of endometriosis on the rectus abdominal muscle diagnosed incidentally during an operation for inguinal hernia repair in women with no surgical history. Two women sought medical attention for a mass found in the pubic abdominal wall. Only 1 woman reported occasional pain. At physical examination in both women, an ovoid swelling in the right pubic area was felt. One woman experienced pain on palpation, and one reported slight discomfort. Ultrasonography demonstrated a heterogeneous hypoechogenic formation with indistinct edges; diagnosis was difficult. Routine clinical and instrumental (pelvic ultrasonography) gynecologic examination in both patients performed shortly before hospitalization had not revealed any macroscopic focus of endometriosis in the pelvic region. At surgery, a lesion consistent with the diagnosis of endometriosis was found, which was confirmed at histologic analysis. These cases could represent the consolidation of different theories of endometriosis diffusion. We suggest including endometriosis in the differential diagnosis of a symptomatic mass in the abdominal wall in women with and without a surgical history."

CD011126,0,17805165,0,Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance features of gynecologic abnormalities in women presenting with acute or chronic abdominal pain.,"Advances in technology and improved availability have led to increased use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate women presenting to the emergency department or to their primary care provider with abdominal and/or pelvic pain. Computed tomographic examinations are often performed to evaluate the presence of appendicitis or renal stone disease. However, gynecologic abnormalities are frequently identified on these examinations. Although ultrasound remains the primary modality by which complaints specific to the pelvis are evaluated, in many instances, CT and MRI imaging occurs before sonographic evaluation.Historically, because of cost, radiation exposure, and relative ease of use, ultrasound examinations have preceded all other imaging modalities when evaluating pelvic disorders. However, as CT and MRI technology have improved, their use in diagnosing causes of pelvic pain has become equal to that of ultrasound. In some cases, primarily because of historic comfort with sonographic evaluation, gynecologic abnormalities originally diagnosed on CT or MRI may be immediately and unnecessarily reevaluated by ultrasound. For a woman in her reproductive years, the most common adnexal masses are physiological cysts, endometriomas, and cystic teratomas. Although lesions are often asymptomatic and incidentally detected, they can present with pain, and they increase the risk of ovarian torsion. Common causes of chronic pelvic pain in this population include leiomyomata and adenomyosis. In postmenopausal women, ovarian carcinoma, which often does not present clinically until a late stage, has to be included in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. If a gynecologic pathology is discovered on CT or MRI, an immediate follow-up ultrasound need not be pursued if the lesion can be characterized as benign, needing immediate surgical intervention, or a variant of normal anatomy. If, on the other hand, findings demonstrate a mass that either is uncharacteristic of a benign lesion, has an indeterminate risk for malignancy, or demonstrates suspicious characteristics for malignancy (such as enhancing mural nodules), further evaluation by serial ultrasound, biochemical marker, and/or CT or MRI is warranted. The purpose of this review is to present a series of commonly encountered gynecologic abnormalities with either CT or MR to make radiologists more familiar with gynecologic pathology on CT and MRI."
CD011126,0,17805166,0,Reimaging the female pelvis with ultrasound after CT: general principles.,"Ultrasound is the most appropriate first imaging test to perform when gynecologic pathology is suspected based on clinical history or physical examination, and imaging is required. However, as a practical matter, a woman's first imaging test evaluating her pelvis may be a computed tomographic (CT) scan; this is especially true when these women present to an acute care facility or emergency department with chronic or acute lower abdominal pain. Radiologists need to be able to recognize the CT features of a variety of gynecologic conditions. However, just as importantly, radiologists should have a firm understanding of general principles that help to clarify when reimaging the pelvis with ultrasound is indicated; furthermore, a clear understanding of these principles helps to focus the sonologist's attention on the sonographic features that will be most helpful in further characterization of abnormal CT findings. This pictorial essay discusses these general principles that clarify when ultrasound is and is not helpful in reimaging the female pelvis after CT."

A voluminous, retroperitoneally located and focally degenerated myoma was associated with severe secondary erythrocytosis (haematocrit: 65.5%) which resolved after hysterectomy. It has been demonstrated previously that myomatous tissue is the source of excessive production of erythropoietin.

Other prerequisites are a very large size of the myoma and the absence of menometrorrhagia of a severity such as to cause a depletion in iron reserves."

We hereby present the case of a spontaneous complete uterine rupture at a gestational age of 34 weeks in a 35 year old patient. The case was managed at the University Teaching Hospital of Yaounde (Cameroon). She had past history of two uterine curettages. She presented with abdominal pain of sudden onset. After ultrasound scan, uterine rupture was diagnosed and an emergency laparotomy done. The entire amniotic sac was found in the peritoneal cavity with a rupture of the uterine fundus. Spontaneous uterine rupture occurs when there is an upper segment uterine scar. This case report shows that past history of curettage is a risk factor for the presence of uterine scar."

CD011126,0,20879699,0,Left lower-quadrant pain: guidelines from the American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria.,"The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain, and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present. The severity of disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or abscess or fistula formation. Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of disease and to identify complications, but it also may diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used."

We report a case of life-threatening menorrhagia upon first menses in a 12-year-old girl who was successfully treated with uterine artery embolization after failure of standard gynecologic and medical measures. Testing eventually revealed a coagulopathy that resulted from decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity in combination with an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Coagulation disorders are more common in patients presenting with severe menorrhagia upon menarche.

CD011126,0,16527602,0,Patient responses to the disclosure of BRCA mutation tests in hereditary breast-ovarian cancer families.,"Limited attention has been given to the impact of BRCA mutation disclosure on participants' psychological reaction and cancer control compliance. We asked women (290 mutation-positive, 370 mutation-negative) from 84 hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) families with known deleterious BRCA mutations to participate in an evaluation regarding cancer prevention recommendations before and after BRCA mutation disclosure. Both men and women (n = 780) were invited to complete a questionnaire to evaluate their psychological response to BRCA mutation disclosure. Before BRCA testing, 23.0% (152 of 660) of these women underwent prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, oophorectomy, or both; of these, 53% (80 of 152) were subsequently found to be mutation negative. After mutation disclosure, 52.9% (110 of 208) of mutation carriers and 0% (0 of 203) of noncarriers underwent prophylactic surgeries. These changes were statistically significant compared with before disclosure (P < 0.0001). The rate of transvaginal ovarian ultrasound screening was significantly increased in mutation carriers (P < 0.015) and marginally decreased in noncarriers (P = 0.063) post disclosure. Psychologically, compared with noncarriers without cancer, a significantly higher percentage of carriers, regardless of their cancer status, felt guilt about passing a mutation to their children, worried about developing additional cancer or their children developing cancer, and were concerned about health insurance discrimination. Despite these psychological consequences, carriers and noncarriers reported a positive attitude toward genetic testing."

We measured expression of ERα, ERβ and the novel G protein-coupled ER (GPR30) in endometrium during window of implantation (WOI) in PCOS patients. Fifteen Chinese women with PCOS were compared to 15 normal subjects. Serial trans-vaginal ultrasonic scanner (TVUS) examinations detected follicular development, and endometrial thickness and pattern were assessed via TVUS on the day of ovulation. GPR30 expression was detected in the cytoplasm of endometrial epithelial cells, and was significantly lower in the PCOS group (p < 0.05). ERα and ERβ expression was lower in the PCOS group, and was detected mainly in the nucleus of endometrial epithelial cells. There was no significant difference in endometrium thickness (p > 0.05), but there was a significant difference in the ultrasonic pattern (p < 0.05). Endometrial expression of GPR30, ERα and ERβ was decreased during WOI in PCOS patients, and was accompanied by poor endometrial receptivity, low pregnancy rate and higher spontaneous abortions. We propose that restored receptor expression might improve endometrial receptivity and help lower infertility associated with PCOS."

A retrospective analysis of 216 completed IUI cycles was used in an attempt to identify significant variables predictive of treatment success. Couples with unexplained infertility and male factor infertility underwent IUI with or without ovarian stimulation. The mean number of IUI cycles per patient was 4.1, the overall pregnancy rate was 27.3% per patient, and the pregnancy rate per cycle was 6.9%. The pregnancy rate was 4.4% when one follicle was produced, whereas with more than two follicles, the rate increased to 21.2%. Hormonal stimulation using clomiphene citrate and/or human menopausal gonadotrophin/follicle stimulating hormone yielded a significant higher pregnancy rate compared to IUI in natural cycles (10.3% versus 3.3%). Although not statistically significant, the pregnancy rate decreased with advancing age of woman.

CD011126,0,17367317,0,Transvaginal ultrasound and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme activity profile in uterine aspirate for diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma in women with postmenopausal bleeding.,"Postmenopausal patients with vaginal bleeding (n = 72) were evaluated with the combination of transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) and analysis of the lactate dehydrogenase (LD) isoenzyme activity profile in uterine fluid aspirates. TVS evaluation of the endometrium was classified as <5 mm, > or =5 mm, or poorly defined. The LD isoenzyme activity profile was characterized as abnormal or normal. Pathologic findings were further evaluated with diagnostic curettage. TVS found the endometrium to be > or =5 mm or poorly defined in 44 patients (61%). Endometrial carcinoma was found in 6 of 72 patients (8%). They appeared in the TVS groups endometrium >5 mm (n = 2) and endometrium poorly defined (n = 4) but not in the endometrium <5 mm. The LD isoenzyme activity profile was abnormal in the six malignant cases and in ten benign cases. Thus, the need for further evaluation with hysteroscopy and curettage was reduced to 16 cases. Since TVS had 100% sensitivity but only 42% specificity, it is suitable for first-level examination in patients with postmenopausal bleeding. The second-level method should have similarly high sensitivity but much higher specificity. The LD isoenzyme activity profile in uterine fluid aspirates had 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Another important feature is that the method is not sensitive to endometrial thickness, amount of sample, sampling device, or dilution. Thus, it is more reliable than aspiration histology. For every hysteroscopy or curettage that can be replaced by LD analysis, the cost is reduced by approximately EUR 720 or 540, respectively."

CD011126,0,25573002,0,Simulation of bright-field microscopy images depicting pap-smear specimen.,"As digital imaging is becoming a fundamental part of medical and biomedical research, the demand for computer-based evaluation using advanced image analysis is becoming an integral part of many research projects. A common problem when developing new image analysis algorithms is the need of large datasets with ground truth on which the algorithms can be tested and optimized. Generating such datasets is often tedious and introduces subjectivity and interindividual and intraindividual variations. An alternative to manually created ground-truth data is to generate synthetic images where the ground truth is known. The challenge then is to make the images sufficiently similar to the real ones to be useful in algorithm development. One of the first and most widely studied medical image analysis tasks is to automate screening for cervical cancer through Pap-smear analysis. As part of an effort to develop a new generation cervical cancer screening system, we have developed a framework for the creation of realistic synthetic bright-field microscopy images that can be used for algorithm development and benchmarking. The resulting framework has been assessed through a visual evaluation by experts with extensive experience of Pap-smear images. The results show that images produced using our described methods are realistic enough to be mistaken for real microscopy images. The developed simulation framework is very flexible and can be modified to mimic many other types of bright-field microscopy images."

CD011126,0,24365021,0,"A slowly reabsorbed, echogenic surgical thread provides a long-lasting ultrasound-detectable marker of grafted ovarian tissue.","This communication reports a novel technical solution for the orthotopic transplant of cryostored-thawed ovarian tissue. The described technique was applied to three young women with iatrogenic ovarian failure. An echogenic thread that is reabsorbed after 6 months was used to fasten the thawed ovarian small fragments before grafting them onto the atrophic ovary. This technical solution made it possible to avoid the loss of small tissue pieces during laparoscopic grafting as well as to precisely localize the grafted tissue by transvaginal ultrasound during the following months. The precise localization of the grafted tissue was particularly helpful when its revascularization and functional recovery were followed up using, respectively, colour Doppler and transvaginal follicle growth examination. In conclusion, the use of a slowly reabsorbed, ultrasound-detectable surgical thread as an ultrasound-detectable marker able to improve the localization of the exact site at which ovarian tissue was grafted is proposed."

Compared with conventional virtual colonoscopy, VU is faster and results in fewer uninspected regions. However, the performance of VU is more vulnerable to the quality of colon segmentation. In this paper, an improved colon segmentation method is proposed to enhance the performance of VU. The improved method is with the use of a novel post-processing scheme, which is composed of two parts: attain more accurate centerlines with the help of scalar complementary geodesic distance field and compensate gap-like artifacts based on local morphological information. We validated the improved method on twenty colon cases via two widely used VU techniques, the ray-casting technique and the conformal-mapping technique. Experimental results indicated that with the use of the improved method, the rates of correct response via ray-casting and conformal-mapping techniques were respectively elevated by 14.9% and 13.1%, while the rates of false response were respectively reduced by 8.4% and 10.8%."

CD011126,0,23327588,0,Endometrial thickness in women with ovulatory dysfunction.,"This study is designed to evaluate the relationship between endometrial thickness and clinical/biochemical parameters in women with chronic anovulation. One hundred and twenty women with ovulatory dysfunction were prospective included, endometrial thickness and endocrine and metabolic parameters were measured. The interval between the examination day and the day of the most recent menstrual bleeding (the anovulatory interval) for the studied subject was an average of 145 ± 186 days. The endometrial thickness averaged 7.1 ± 3.2 mm. Correlation analyses revealed that the endometrial thickness was positively correlated with body mass index but was not correlated with age, serum androgens, or estradiol (E2) levels. We further classified the subjects into two groups based on endometrial thickness: Group A, endometrial thickness <7 mm and Group B, endometrial thickness ≥7 mm. The anovulatory interval, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, E2 and androgen levels were not significantly different between Groups A and B. Group B had higher body weight and more risk for metabolic syndrome. We concluded that endometrial thickness in women with ovulatory dysfunction is positively correlated with body weight status but is not correlated with serum androgens or E2 levels."

However, no robust relationship exists between enlargement of the ESEMy Unit and adenomyosis proven on hysterectomy specimen examination; moreover, if any correlation exists, it lacks histological validation in women wishing to preserve fertility. While adenomyosis effects on fertility, if any, remain elusive, thickening of the ESEMy Unit have been consistently linked to fertility impairment in both experimental and clinical models. The hypothesis tested herein is that a novel condition exists, called ""ESEMy Unit disruption disease""; it is epidemiologically different from adenomyosis, diagnosable on imaging and bears a clear impact on human fertility through various mechanisms. A new wave of good quality studies may be elicited by a clear distinction between adenomyosis and the ""ESEMy Unit disruption disease""."

CD011126,0,21945680,0,Polyplex-microbubble hybrids for ultrasound-guided plasmid DNA delivery to solid tumors.,"Microbubble ultrasound contrast agents are being developed as image-guided gene carriers for targeted delivery in vivo. In this study, novel polyplex-microbubbles were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for systemic circulation and tumor transfection. Branched polyethylenimine (PEI; 25 kDa) was modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG; 5 kDa), thiolated and covalently attached to maleimide groups on lipid-coated microbubbles. The PEI-microbubbles demonstrated increasingly positive surface charge and DNA loading capacity with increasing maleimide content. The in vivo ultrasound contrast persistence of PEI-microbubbles was measured in the healthy mouse kidney, and a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model accounting for free and adherent microbubbles was developed to describe the anomalous time-intensity curves. The model suggested that PEI loading dramatically reduced free circulation and increased nonspecific adhesion to the vasculature. However, DNA loading to form polyplex-microbubbles increased circulation in the bloodstream and decreased nonspecific adhesion. PEI-microbubbles coupled to a luciferase bioluminescence reporter plasmid DNA were shown to transfect tumors implanted in the mouse kidney. Site-specific delivery was achieved using ultrasound applied over the tumor area following bolus injection of the DNA/PEI-microbubbles. In vivo imaging showed over 10-fold higher bioluminescence from the tumor region compared to untreated tissue. Ex vivo analysis of excised tumors showed greater than 40-fold higher expression in tumor tissue than non-sonicated control (heart) tissue. These results suggest that the polyplex-microbubble platform offers improved control of DNA loading and packaging suitable for ultrasound-guided tissue transfection."

Lobar nephronia is a rare condition in pediatric patients that can be screened by ultrasound or computed tomography to distinguish it from a renal abscess. Treatment for lobar nephronia requires at least 14 days of antimicrobial therapy and a follow-up assessment by renal ultrasonography or dimercaptosuccinic acid scan. We report an unusual case of a 2-year-old girl with an imperforate hymen and pyocolpos. The pyocolpos compressed the left lower ureter to cause hydroureter, hydronephrosis, and nephronia. Partial hymenotomy was performed to drain the pus, and antibiotics were administered for a total of 3 weeks. There was a good outcome. This case demonstrates the need to perform a full physical examination, particularly a genital examination, in newborns.

Waist-to-hip ratio, insulin resistance, total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels were significantly elevated in obese, compared with non-obese, patients. Both groups were treated with a low-dose step-up protocol of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) with a starting dose of 50 IU/day and, every third day, a 25-IU increase in the dose until the appropriate dose was achieved for each individual, up to a maximum of 175 IU/day. In the obese group only, repeat therapy commenced in the second ovulatory cycle in women who had not become pregnant, however a starting dose of 75 IU/day was then used, with incremental and maximum dose as before. The results of the starting dose of 75 IU/day rFSH were compared with the results of a 50 IU/day rFSH starting dose in the obese group. A starting dose of 50 IU/day rFSH in a low-dose step-up regimen was found to be effective, safe and well-tolerated for inducing follicular development in non-obese infertile women with PCOS.

Most GBPs are benign cholesterol polyps, adenomyomatosis, or inflammatory polyps. Currently, cholecystectomy is widely accepted as appropriate care for polyps 10 mm or larger as they present a higher risk for malignancy. However, the management of small polyps smaller than 10 mm has continued to be a dilemma to clinicians and radiologists. Many authors support a nonoperative approach with imaging follow-up for polyps smaller than 10 mm, as most have been shown to be benign. However, small polyps do have the potential to be neoplastic adenomas and become malignant. In this report, we will describe a case of a tiny GBP that subsequently developed into a 20-mm carcinoma over a period of 2 years."

Traditional grading systems do not accurately assess lesion severity because colposcopic impression alone is unreliable for diagnosis. The likelihood of finding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher increases when two or more cervical biopsies are performed. Excisional and ablative methods have similar treatment outcomes for the eradication of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. However, diagnostic excisional methods, including loop electrosurgical excision procedure and cold knife conization, are associated with an increased risk of adverse obstetric outcomes, such as preterm labor and low birth weight. Methods of endometrial assessment have a high sensitivity for detecting endometrial carcinoma and benign causes of uterine bleeding without unnecessary procedures. Endometrial biopsy can reliably detect carcinoma involving a large portion of the endometrium, but is suboptimal for diagnosing focal lesions. A 3- to 4-mm cutoff for endometrial thickness on transvaginal ultrasonography yields the highest sensitivity to exclude endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women. Saline infusion sonohysteroscopy can differentiate globally thickened endometrium amenable to endometrial biopsy from focal abnormalities best assessed by hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy with directed biopsy is the most sensitive and specific method of diagnosing endometrial carcinoma, other than hysterectomy."

CD011126,0,23674411,0,Electronic cleansing for 24-h limited bowel preparation CT colonography using principal curvature flow.,"CT colonography (CTC) is one of the recommended methods for colorectal cancer screening. The subject's preparation is one of the most burdensome aspects of CTC with a cathartic bowel preparation. Tagging of the bowel content with an oral contrast medium facilitates CTC with limited bowel preparation. Unfortunately, such preparations adversely affect the 3-D image quality. Thus far, data acquired after very limited bowel preparation were evaluated with a 2-D reading strategy only. Existing cleansing algorithms do not work sufficiently well to allow a primary 3-D reading strategy. We developed an electronic cleansing algorithm, aimed to realize optimal 3-D image quality for low-dose CTC with 24-h limited bowel preparation. The method employs a principal curvature flow algorithm to remove heterogeneities within poorly tagged fecal residue. In addition, a pattern recognition-based approach is used to prevent polyp-like protrusions on the colon surface from being removed by the method. Two experts independently evaluated 40 CTC cases by means of a primary 2-D approach without involvement of electronic cleansing as well as by a primary 3-D method after electronic cleansing. The data contained four variations of 24-h limited bowel preparation and was based on a low radiation dose scanning protocol. The sensitivity for lesions ≥ 6 mm was significantly higher for the primary 3-D reading strategy (84%) than for the primary 2-D reading strategy (68%) (p = 0.031). The reading time was increased from 5:39 min (2-D) to 7:09 min (3-D) (p = 0.005); the readers' confidence was reduced from 2.3 (2-D) to 2.1 (3-D) ( p = 0.013) on a three-point Likert scale. Polyp conspicuity for cleansed submerged lesions was similar to not submerged lesions (p = 0.06). To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe and clinically validate an electronic cleansing algorithm that facilitates low-dose CTC with 24-h limited bowel preparation."
CD011126,0,22674594,0,Ovarian ectopic pregnancy.,"The authors report the rare case of a 25-year-old female who suffered from an ovarian ectopic pregnancy. She presented at 10 weeks gestation with a 1-day history of vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal discomfort. β-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration was 8538 IU/ml. Ultrasound showed a right adnexal mass 4.0 × 3.8 × 5.5 cm with a 16 mm cystic area suggesting right ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed a ruptured right ovarian ectopic pregnancy with haemoperitoneum. This was excised laparoscopically. She made a good postoperative recovery and was discharged on the second postoperative day. Histology confirmed a ruptured ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian ectopic pregnancy is a rare condition. There are two features that make this an unusual case; the relatively late gestation at which she presented and her mild presenting features. Unlike tubal ectopic pregnancies, which usually present at earlier gestations, this patient presented relatively late. She also presented with mild symptoms and signs."
CD011126,0,22153986,0,Management of endometrial polyps diagnosed before or during ICSI cycles.,"This retrospective study aimed to shed light on the management options of endometrial polyps diagnosed before or during intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. The study included all fresh ICSI cycles performed in the Anatolia IVF Center between July 2005 and January 2009. Group 1 consisted of 47 patients who were diagnosed with an endometrial polyp before their ICSI cycle. All patients diagnosed with an endometrial polyp by transvaginal ultrasonography before the ICSI cycle underwent hysteroscopic polyp resection. Group 1 was compared with 47 matched control patients without endometrial polyps who underwent standard ICSI cycles (group 2). Group 3 included 128 patients diagnosed with an endometrial polyp during stimulation in their ICSI cycles. Group 3 was compared with 128 matched control patients without endometrial polyps who underwent standard ICSI cycles (group 4). Patients diagnosed with an endometrial polyp before ICSI cycles were similar to their controls with regard to clinical pregnancy (29.8% versus 38.3%) and live-birth (25.5% versus 31.9%) rates per transfer, as were patients diagnosed with an endometrial polyp during ovarian stimulation (clinical pregnancy rates 45.3% versus 46.9%; live-birth rates 40.6% versus 39.8%). In conclusion, further studies are required to identify the most appropriate management of endometrial polyps."
CD011126,0,22836290,0,Uterine rupture in the second trimester of pregnancy as an iatrogenic complication of laparoscopic myomectomy.,"Uterine rupture is one of the most dangerous obstetric emergencies carrying a high risk for the mother and the fetus. Reports about uterine rupture in pregnancy following previous laparoscopic surgery have not been frequent; however, an increasing rate of the occurrence of this complication has been observed and reviewed in contemporary literature. We report a case of a spontaneous uterine rupture at 22 weeks of gestation in a 25-year old primigravida, who had had a laparoscopic removal of a small, peduncular, asymptomatic myoma located in the right uterine horn 20 months earlier. Ultrasound examination and subsequent urgent laparotomy confirmed a spontaneous uterine rupture with a nonviable fetus in the peritoneal cavity. Women planning to become pregnant should be qualified for laparoscopic myomectomy with special carefulness. Special attention must be paid to the potential solutions that limit the risk of postoperative uterine rupture, if the absolute necessity for the enucleation of myomas during the reproductive age occurs and a decision about laparoscopic intervention is made."
CD011126,0,21638034,0,Pelvic ultrasound immediately following MDCT in female patients with abdominal/pelvic pain: is it always necessary?,"To determine the added value of reimaging the female pelvis with ultrasound (US) immediately following multidetector CT (MDCT) in the emergent setting. CT and US exams of 70 patients who underwent MDCT for evaluation of abdominal/pelvic pain followed by pelvic ultrasound within 48 h were retrospectively reviewed by three readers. Initially, only the CT images were reviewed followed by evaluation of CT images in conjunction with US images. Diagnostic confidence was recorded for each reading and an exact Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare the two. Changes in diagnosis based on combined CT and US readings versus CT readings alone were identified. Confidence intervals (95%) were derived for the percentage of times US reimaging can be expected to lead to a change in diagnosis relative to the diagnosis based on CT interpretation alone. Ultrasound changed the diagnosis for the ovaries/adnexa 8.1% of the time (three reader average); the majority being cases of a suspected CT abnormality found to be normal on US. Ultrasound changed the diagnosis for the uterus 11.9% of the time (three reader average); the majority related to the endometrial canal. The 95% confidence intervals for the ovaries/adnexa and uterus were 5-12.5% and 8-17%, respectively. Ten cases of a normal CT were followed by a normal US with 100% agreement across all three readers. Experienced readers correctly diagnosed ruptured ovarian cysts and tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA) based on CT alone with 100% agreement. US reimaging after MDCT of the abdomen and pelvis is not helpful: (1) following a normal CT of the pelvic organs or (2) when CT findings are diagnostic and/or characteristic of certain entities such as ruptured cysts and TOA. Reimaging with ultrasound is warranted for (1) less-experienced readers to improve diagnostic confidence or when CT findings are not definitive, (2) further evaluation of suspected endometrial abnormalities. A distinction should be made between the need for immediate vs. follow-up imaging with US after CT."

CD011126,0,21731982,0,Entangled bilateral adnexal torsion in a premenarchal girl: a laparoscopic approach.,"Bilateral adnexal torsion is a rare event in children. A high index of suspicion, together with prompt surgical treatment, would help to save the ovaries and preserve its function. We report a case of entangled bilateral adnexal torsion managed successfully via laparoscopy. An 11-year-old premenarchal girl complained of chronic intermittent abdominal pain that worsened over 24 hours. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a bilobed cystic tumour (10 cm × 12 cm × 12 cm and 3 cm × 4 cm) lying in the left abdomen and another cystic tumour (10 cm × 6 cm × 5 cm) in the pelvis. At laparoscopy, entangled bilateral adnexal torsion was seen. After disentanglement and detorsion of both adnexa, bilateral ovarian cystectomy was performed, and both ovaries were preserved. This case illustrates that laparoscopic treatment is possible for large entangled bilateral adnexal torsion in children."

The tumor was asymptomatic and closely attached to the decidua; after a normal term delivery, it was revealed to be embedded within the placenta. Microscopically, the neoplasm had a high mitotic rate and characteristic features of endometrial stromal tumor, such as CD10, progesterone receptor positivity, and an expansile linear, non-infiltrative pushing border. There were also pregnancy-related changes such as decidualization and myxoid change. In conclusion, the lesion was considered a benign endometrial stromal nodule with an unusual morphology and increased proliferation rate due to the hormonal stimuli of pregnancy."
CD011126,0,16395572,0,[Unstable thorax after a coughing fit in a 70-year-old adipose patient].,"Lung herniation is uncommon and has been defined as the protrusion of pulmonary tissue and pleural membranes through defects of the thoracic wall. In combination with rib fractures caused by single massive coughing fit, spontaneous lung herniation has previously been reported only three times. To our knowledge, in combination with multiple rib fractures and flail chest, as in the case presented, it has never been reported. Large lung hernias should be treated with prosthetic patches because of unlikely spontaneous recovery and the risk of incarceration. In our case, an anterolateral thoracotomy was performed. After resection of the herniated pleural membrane, a 30 x 30-cm polypropylene mesh was fixed to the diaphragm and with nonresorbable pericostal sutures to the thoracic wall. With this procedure, the loss in stability caused by the ruptured anterior intercostal muscular system could be restored. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was dismissed on day 12."
CD011126,0,17617321,0,A patient with cardiac fibroma and a subvalvular aortic stenosis caused by a subvalvular membrane.,"In this report, we describe a patient with two uncommon cardiac abnormalities: a subvalvular membrane in the left ventricular outflow tract and a cardiac fibroma (CF) in the left atrium. This 56-year-old patient presented with a known subaortic stenosis caused by a subvalvular membrane, a large mass attached to the interatrial septum in the immediate proximity of mitral valve, and a cardiac history of infective endocarditis. Initially, the mass was thought to be an old vegetation. However, the histology of this lesion diagnosed a CF. Primary cardiac tumors are rare. Myxoma and papillary fibroelastoma are the most frequently encountered primary cardiac tumors. CF is usually diagnosed during childhood. In this case, the presentation of the CF was atypical for 3 reasons: the tumor was diagnosed in an adult, the fibroma was pedunculated, and not located within the myocardium but originated from the interatrial septum."

CD011126,0,22626769,0,Large animal models for the study of ovarian follicular dynamics in women.,"Initial studies of the ovaries were based on postmortem anatomic descriptions, followed by histologic and endocrine approaches. The introduction of high-resolution ultrasonography provided a long-awaited tool to image the reproductive tissues in situ in both animals and humans. Critical studies of the characteristics and control of ovarian follicular and luteal dynamics in nonhuman primates, rodents, and domestic farm animals have involved frequent (i.e., daily or multiple times a day) blood sampling and ultrasonography. Studies of this nature in women are difficult, and often unethical to conduct. Differences in antral folliculogenesis between humans and animals appear to be more in detail rather than in essence, and may reflect differences in intrinsic physiology or merely differences in our ability to detect changes in a given species. In women, the presence of endometrial shedding and symmetric luteal and follicular phases are different from that observed during the estrous cycles of domestic farm animals but despite these differences, general similarities in antral follicular dynamics exist. A continuous pattern of antral follicle development was originally proposed in domestic livestock species; however, the use of frequent serial ultrasonography and simultaneous endocrine profiling in these animal species has resulted in a broad understanding of follicular wave dynamics. Follicular waves have now been described in every species in which this approach has been used, including humans. The relatively large diameters of antral follicles in cows and mares, compared with monkeys, sheep, and rodents provide greater feasibility for characterizing antral follicular dynamics ultrasonographically. While the use of large animal models has increased our understanding of ovarian function and provides the hypothetical basis for studies in women, differences in vocabulary, culture, and research methodologies has hampered knowledge translation. These differences represent a systemic impediment to a broad understanding of ovarian function and limits progress and innovation in the development of safer and more efficacious treatments for infertility and contraception."

CD011126,0,14606366,0,Emerging technology in cancer treatment: radiotherapy modalities.,"This is a period of rapid developments in radiotherapy for malignant disease. New methods of targeting tumors with computed tomography (CT) virtual simulation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron-emission tomography (PET) fusion provide the clinician with information heretofore unknown. Linear accelerators (linacs) with multileaf collimation (MLC) have replaced lead-alloy blocks. Indeed, new attachments to the linacs allow small, pencil beams of radiation to be emitted as the linac gantry rotates around the patient, conforming to three-dimensional (3D) targets as never before. Planning for these delivery systems now takes the form of ""inverse planning,"" with CT information used to map targets and the structures to be avoided. In the area of brachytherapy, techniques utilizing the 3D information provided by the new imaging modalities have been perfected. Permanent seed prostate implants and high-dose-rate (HDR) irradiation techniques targeting bronchial, head and neck, biliary, gynecologic, and other anatomic targets are now commonplace radiotherapy tools. CT-guided permanent seed implants are being investigated, and a new method of treating early breast cancer with HDR brachytherapy via a balloon catheter placed in the lumpectomized cavity is coming to the forefront. Newer modalities for the treatment of malignant and benign disease using stereotactic systems and body radiosurgery are being developed. Targeted radionuclides using microspheres that contain radioemitters and other monoclonal antibody systems tagged with radioemitters have been recently approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration."

CD011126,0,20186113,0,Best methods for identification and treatment of PCOS.,"The polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) includes a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and signs. Three different diagnostic classifications have been proposed to define this disease. The first one, published in 1990, known as the ""NIH criteria"" requires the simultaneous presence of hyperandrogenism and menstrual dysfunction in order to diagnose PCOS. Later on, in 2003, an expert panel met in Rotterdam and added to the previous criteria the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology detected by transvaginal ultrasonography. The later classification broadened the spectrum of PCOS and also included women with oligomenorrhea and PCO without hyperandrogenism or hyperandrogenism and PCO without menstrual dysfunction. Finally, the Androgen Excess Society, published in 2006 new diagnostic criteria which required the presence of clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, with either PCO or menstrual dysfunction to diagnose PCOS. This review focuses on the diagnostic techniques and methods of treatment for PCOS patients. Special attention is given to the role of insulin resistance and the potential utility of insulin sensitizers in management of the syndrome. The benefit and utmost importance of lifestyle modification for the long-term health of these women is stressed as well. It is hoped that some clarity in this regard will allow more women to not only be diagnosed and managed properly for their presenting symptoms (hirsutism, irregular menses, etc.), but also to be educated and managed for the continuing health risk of insulin resistance throughout their lives."

CD011126,0,17280766,0,Diagnosis of gallbladder diseases by contrast-enhanced phase-inversion harmonic ultrasonography.,"We evaluated the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography(US) for detecting and differentiating gallbladder lesions. Contrast-enhanced coded phase-inversion harmonic US was performed on 90 patients with gallbladder abnormalities. After administering Levovist, we observed the gallbladders in real time. Contrast-enhanced coded phase-inversion harmonic ultrasonography was compared with B-mode US and contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) with regard to the sensitivity and specificity in depicting the elevated gallbladder lesions. Furthermore, we assessed how the vascular patterns of the elevated gallbladder lesions depicted by contrast-enhanced US correlated with the diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced US efficiently discriminated true lesions from biliary sludge, unlike B-mode US. Consequently, contrast-enhanced US was more specific (100%) than B-mode US (81%), although their sensitivities were similar (98% and 96%, respectively). Contrast-enhanced US was also more sensitive that contrast-enhanced CT (98% versus 79%), although the two methods were equally sensitive (100% versus 95%). We classified the vascular patterns of the abnormalities depicted by contrast-enhanced US in the 90 cases into types 1 to 4, which represent branch-like, heterogeneous, homogeneous, and avascular patterns, respectively. All type 1 and 2 lesions were over 10 mm in size while most (88%) type 3 lesions were 10 mm or less in size. While the majority of carcinomas (86%) were type 1 or 2, three benign lesions also showed these patterns. Thus, the vascular pattern may simply reflect the size of the lesion and therefore its usefulness in diagnosing gallbladder lesions may be limited. Nevertheless, contrast-enhanced US is clearly superior to the other techniques in discriminating biliary sludge from other lesions."

At endovaginal sonography we detected a polypoid mass. Extensive intrauterine synechiae within the uterus were noted during hysteroscopy, and a polypoid lesion was seen adjacent to a synechia. Biopsy demonstrated endometrial adenocarcinoma arising from a synechia. Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. A well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the endometrium was demonstrated. Asherman syndrome and endometrial adenocarcinoma can exist simultaneously. In such cases, hysteroscopy is essential for diagnosis of synechiae and for target biopsy."

The study incorporates inclusion of the molecular hyperpolarizability β of collagen and optical scattering, both of which are wavelength dependent. Using 3D SHG imaging and Monte Carlo simulations, we find the wavelength dependence of β is not well described by a two-state model based on known absorption bands. We further find that longer wavelength excitation is inefficient as the reduction in scattering is overcome by the decreased β far from resonance and the optimal excitation is within the 800-900 nm range. The impact is larger for backward collected SHG."

Mean uterus size was 86.6 mm x 49.6 mm x 40.6 mm overall, 72.8 mm x 42.8 mm x 32.4 mm for nulliparous women and 90.8 mm x 51.7 mm x 43.0 mm for multiparous women. Mean age was 31.7 +/- 9.6 years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.7 +/- 4.0 kg/m2. Uterus size was significantly associated with parity and age; but not with BMI. Our findings show a greater mean uterus size than reported by others. Ultrasonographic measurement of uterus size is valuable for predicting pathologies associated with abnormal uterine size."
CD011126,0,14973405,0,Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome: from NIH criteria to ESHRE-ASRM guidelines.,"In the past, the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was based on National Institute of Health (NIH) criteria (hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation) or on sonographic findings of polycystic ovaries. Diffe-rences in diagnosis criteria made it difficult to compare the data of studies coming from different countries. Moreover, there was criticism of both the methods used. In 2003, at a joint meeting of the European Society for Human Reproduction (ESHRE) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), new guidelines for the diagnosis of PCOS were suggested. According to these guidelines, it is possible to reach a diagnosis of PCOS when at least 2 of these 3 elements are present: hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and polycystic ovaries. New criteria for the echographic diagnosis of polycystic ovaries have been suggested, too. These diagnostic guidelines represent important progress because they are more flexible and permit us to make the diagnosis in patients who were previously excluded by the syndrome (such as ovulatory hyperandrogenic women with polycystic ovaries or anovulatory normoandrogenic women with polycystic ovaries). However, doubts still exist and regard some borderline group of patients such as hirsute ovulatory normoandrogenic women with polycystic ovaries. A new classification of PCOS syndrome is suggested on the basis of new guidelines."
CD011126,0,23582753,0,Prognostic factors for successful varicocelectomy to treat varicocele-associated male infertility.,"The present study identified prognostic factors for successful varicocelectomy for the treatment of varicocele-induced male infertility. All varicoceles were diagnosed and graded by physical examination and ultrasound. Pre- and postoperative analysis of semen specimens measured sperm density, morphology and motility. 'Responder' and 'non-responder' status was determined by semen analyses at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Varicocele Grades 1, 2 and 3 were found in 16, 36 and 28 patients, respectively; 49 patients (61.3%) were responders based on improved seminograms. Significant postoperative increases were noted in sperm density (from 18.20 ± 14.76 × 10(6) to 32.36 ± 24.81 × 10(6)mL(-1); P<0.001), sperm morphology (from 57.21 ± 17.35% to 62.66 ± 15.18%; P=0.006) and percentage motility (from 29.89 ± 14.71% to 50.92 ± 19.30%; P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that age (odds ratio (OR) 0.56; P<0.001) and preoperative sperm density (OR 1.22; P=0.001) had significant unfavourable and favourable associations, respectively, with the likelihood of successful varicocelectomy. Furthermore, a preoperative sperm density of 12 × 10(6)mL(-1) as a cut-off point was able to predict successful varicocelectomy with a sensitivity of 77.6% and specificity of 77.4% (area under the curve=0.85; P<0.001; 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.92). Age and preoperative sperm density are prognostic factors for successful varicocelectomy. The results of the present study may allow clinicians to predict surgical improvement in fertility in patients with varicocele."

This study is a retrospective analysis of 138 women who underwent an operation and had a preoperative diagnosis of ovarian malignancy at the Government Medical College Hospital, Chandigarh, from January 2004 to January 2008. Among these 138 women, seven cases (5.7%) of pelvic TB were identified. Abdominal pain and distension were the most common presenting symptoms. All patients had a pelvic mass, six had ascites (85%) and five had a fever (71%). The mean cancer antigen (CA) 125 level was 295 IU (13-529). Pelvic TB can present with symptoms and signs which mimic ovarian malignancy. Therefore, a high-index of clinical suspicion should be maintained when treating patients in countries with a high prevalence of TB."

A history of uterine artery embolization (UAE) because of symptomatic uterine fibroids, and assisted reproductive treatment may predispose to this unusual implantation site. A 40-year-old woman with a history of uterine fibroids underwent a transfer of two embryos after intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment. The combined findings on transvaginal ultrasound scan, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scan, suction curettage, diagnostic hysteroscopy and laparoscopy were compatible with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy within the myometrium, at the site of a necrotized intramyometrial fibroid following UAE. Treatment with systemic methotrexate resulted in successful resolution of this ectopic pregnancy. In conclusion, this study reports a pregnancy within a previously necrotized fibroid. Findings suggest that in patients with a history of UAE for the treatment of uterine fibroids and who subsequently undergo assisted reproductive treatment, the risk of an ectopic pregnancy within the myometrium has to be considered."

This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical benefit and diagnostic accuracy of the procedure in the setting of a dedicated one-stop clinic for women with postmenopausal bleeding. The study also examined the factors that would affect the adequacy of endometrial samples in terms of their suitability for histopathalogical examination. Data from 97 consecutive patients attending the clinic were collected and analysed. All the patients had a transvaginal ultrasound scan and an endometrial Pipelle sample was attempted unless refused by the patient. The analysis revealed that the procedure avoided the need for hysteroscopy in 61.5% of cases with an endometrial thickness of > 4mm. No cases of endometrial cancer were missed after successful Pipelle sampling. The ability to obtain an adequate endometrial sample was primarily affected by the endometrial thickness. There is only a 27% probability of getting an adequate endometrial sample in the group of women with an endometrial thickness of < 5 mm. The study recommends this procedure for the group of women with an endometrial thickness of > 4 mm. However, when the endometrial thickness is < or = 4 mm, little can be gained from endometrial sampling as malignancy is rare and the chance of getting an adequate sample is small."

The peculiarities of hormonal secretion in 30 patients have been studied. Existence of transitory hyperprolactinemia, excessive production of the lutheinizing hormone and deficit of progesterone production was determined. These factors hamper the folliculorexis and the follicular cyst does develop. Thus, in the occurrence of follicular cysts the major role belongs to the hypothalamic-pituitary disregulation. Therefore, the suppressive hormonal therapy is justified as highly effective. Dynamic ultrasound makes it possible to identify the conservative treatment terms and where necessary, timely transfer of the patient to the laparoscopic treatment."

The retrospective study included 5 women with complete septate uterus and cervical duplication and who also experienced infertility with or without pregnancy loss. All patients underwent bougie-guided or light-guided hysteroscopic perforation of the uterine septum above the endocervix, followed by septum resection. The success rate of complete uterine septum perforation under bougie guidance was 60% (3 of 5 procedures), and of light guidance was 100% (2 procedures). After hysteroscopic septum resection, 2 of 5 women achieved pregnancy within 3 months and delivered uneventfully at term.

CD011126,0,24762434,0,Estrogen promotes Leydig cell engulfment by macrophages in male infertility.,"Male infertility accounts for almost half of infertility cases worldwide. A subset of infertile men exhibit reduced testosterone and enhanced levels of estradiol (E2), though it is unclear how increased E2 promotes deterioration of male fertility. Here, we utilized a transgenic mouse strain that overexpresses human CYP19, which encodes aromatase (AROM+ mice), and mice with knockout of Esr1, encoding estrogen receptor α (ERαKO mice), to analyze interactions between viable Leydig cells (LCs) and testicular macrophages that may lead to male infertility. In AROM+ males, enhanced E2 promoted LC hyperplasia and macrophage activation via ERα signaling. E2 stimulated LCs to produce growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6), which mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by bridging cells with surface exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) to macrophage receptors, including the tyrosine kinases TYRO3, AXL, and MER. Overproduction of E2 increased apoptosis-independent extrusion of PS on LCs, which in turn promoted engulfment by E2/ERα-activated macrophages that was mediated by AXL-GAS6-PS interaction. We further confirmed E2-dependant engulfment of LCs by real-time 3D imaging. Furthermore, evaluation of molecular markers in the testes of patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) revealed enhanced expression of CYP19, GAS6, and AXL, which suggests that the AROM+ mouse model reflects human infertility. Together, these results suggest that GAS6 has a potential as a clinical biomarker and therapeutic target for male infertility."

The cytogenetic laboratory provides a prenatal service to obstetrics-gynecology departments of different hospitals in Izmir. A limited number of patients (6-8 per week) is randomly accepted for prenatal cytogenetic study. Over the 4 years period 1190 prenatal cytogenetic tests were performed in our center. The most common indication was advanced maternal age for each year. However its rate has increased significantly within the years (35.68% in 1998, 61.38% in 2001), while the rate of both triple test and ultrasound scanning indications decreased. Culture success rates have improved (97.97% in 1998, 99.74% in 2001). Comparing the first two years to the last two years the rate of abnormal cytogenetic results decreased significantly (3.83% in 1998-99, 2.48% in 2000-01). The major reason for this decrease is probably related to the changes in indications throughout the years."

However, this is an empirical point and does not necessarily reflect dose to the tumor. Although 3-dimensional image-based treatment planning is extensively used in prostate brachytherapy, only a few institutions have used it to shape the dose distribution in cervical brachytherapy. To facilitate and standardize image-based dosimetry for cervical cancer brachytherapy, the American Image-guided Brachytherapy Working Group and the European Gynecological GEC-ESTRO Working Group have recently proposed nomenclature for volume definition and recommendations for image-based intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer. The recommendations of the 2 groups are very similar and are discussed together in this article. Proposals are made for research in image-based brachytherapy for cervical cancer. At a recent transatlantic image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy workshop (Chicago, IL, July 28, 2005), it was suggested that because the recommendations are so similar and to prevent confusion, the nomenclature suggested by the European Group be adopted and future joint contouring workshops be organized to facilitate image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy."

The etiology is unknown, but theories include retained fetal bone and osseous metaplasia of endometrial tissue. We describe the cases of three subfertility patients, all with a history of surgical termination of pregnancy. Each patient underwent a hysteroscopy after highly echogenic foci were seen in the uterus on transvaginal ultrasound examination. During hysteroscopy, several coral-like bony fragments were seen and removed by sharp curettage. On histological examination, these fragments were found to be mature, necrotic bone. This case report confirms the importance of routine baseline evaluation of the endometrium in subfertile women with a history of termination of pregnancy."

It was found that as compared with normal myometrium, the proliferating uterine myoma had an extensive peripheral vascularization of myomatous nodule with a decreased resistance index, which is a marker of myocyte proliferative activity in the myomatous nodule. These data were supported by histological findings in material obtained at operations, which demonstrated the signs of proliferative growth. Using EPR, it was shown that uterine myoma was characterized by an estrogen-dependent intensification of the processes of free-radical oxidation, which correlated with a degree of hormonal changes. Accumulation of free-radical oxidation activators and of ions of ferritin-unbound iron in the tumor tissue is indicative of the intensification of proliferative activity of the cells of uterine myoma and is one of the risk factors of neoplastic growth. Hyperestrogenemia, characteristic for the myoma development, is one of the reasons for NO synthesis activation, which, in the oxidative stress, is transformed into cytotoxic peroxinitrite, contributing to further intensification of an oxidative stress and malignant transformation of tissues."

The reliability of the measurements was also assessed. A total of 25 women having an anterior colporrhaphy operation had pre- and post-repair imaging using a standard bladder volume. There was a statistically significant change (p ≤ 0.04) in the posterior urethrovesical angle (PUA) from 115° (SD 37) before surgery, to 135° (SD 30) after surgery. There was no significant change (p = 0.93) in the anterior urethrovesical angle before 73° (SD 14) after surgery 73° (SD 14).

This method can be used to reduce the false alarms introduced by rectal tubes in current polyp detection algorithms. The method is hierarchical, detecting parts of the tube in increasing order of complexity, from tube cross sections and tube segments to the whole flexible tube. To increase the speed of the algorithm, candidate parts are generated using a voting strategy. The detected tube segments are combined into a flexible tube using a dynamic programming algorithm. Testing the algorithm on 210 unseen datasets resulted in a tube detection rate of 94.7% and 0.12 false alarms per volume. The method can be easily retrained to detect and segment other tubular 3D structures."

The vast majority of these methods (implicitly) model polyps as approximately spherical protrusions. Polyp shape and size varies greatly, however and is often far from spherical. We propose a shape and size invariant method to detect suspicious regions. The method works by locally deforming the colon surface until the second principal curvature is smaller than or equal to zero. The amount of deformation is a quantitative measure of the 'protrudeness'. The deformation field allows for the computation of various additional features to be used in supervised pattern recognition. It is shown how only a few features are needed to achieve 95% sensitivity at 10 false positives (FP) per dataset for polyps larger than 6 mm."

Local intensity profiles and curvature information have been previously used for discriminating between simple geometric shapes such as spherical and cylindrical structures. This paper introduces novel analytical shape models for colon-specific anatomy, viz. folds and polyps, built by combining parts with simpler geometric shapes. The models better approximate the actual shapes of relevant anatomical structures while allowing the application of model-based analysis on the simpler model parts. All parameters are derived from the analytical models, resulting in a simple voxel labeling scheme for classifying individual voxels in a CT volume.

Cervical myomas exacerbates surgical difficulties, such as poor operative field, difficult suture repairs, and blood loss. When performing myomectomy for cervical myomas, care must be taken to avoid injuries to neighboring structures in the pelvic cavity.These structures include the bladder in front of the cervix, the rectum behind the cervix, and the uterine arteries and ureters on both sides. Myomectomy for cervical myoma is empirically difficult and frequently problematic. The authors report a case of giant cervical myoma presenting with urinary incontinence."
CD011126,0,17477736,0,Real-time reflectance confocal microscopy: comparison of two-dimensional images and three-dimensional image stacks for detection of cervical precancer.,"Confocal microscopy can provide real-time, 2-D and 3-D images of the cellular morphology and tissue architecture features that pathologists use to detect precancerous lesions without the need for tissue removal, sectioning, and staining. The utility of 3-D confocal image stacks of epithelial tissue for detecting dysplasia has not yet been explored. We aim to extract morphometry and tissue architecture information from 2-D confocal reflectance images and 3-D image stacks from fresh, unstained cervical biopsies and compare their potential for detecting dysplasia. Nine biopsies are obtained from eight patients; confocal images are acquired pre- and postacetic acid at multiple epithelial depths in 1.5 mum-intervals. Postacetic acid images are processed to segment cell nuclei; after segmentation, 2-D images taken at 50 mum below the tissue surface, and the entire 3-D image stacks are processed to extract morphological and architectural features. Data are analyzed to determine which features gave the best separation between normal and high-grade cervical precancer. Most significant differences are obtained from parameters extracted from the 3-D image stacks. However, in all cases where the 2-D features were multiplicatively scaled by the depth of acquisition divided by the epithelial thickness or scaled by the scattering coefficient, the significance level is equal to or greater than the comparable feature extracted from the 3-D image stacks. A linear discriminant function previously developed to separate 19 samples of normal tissue and high-grade cervical precancer based on the nuclear-to-cytoplasm (N/C) ratio and epithelial scattering coefficient is prospectively applied to the nine biopsies examined to determine the accuracy with which it could separate normal tissue from cervical intra epithelial neoplasia (CIN) 23. For the entire data set of 28 biopsies, a sensitivity and specificity of 100% is produced using this discriminant function; the scattering coefficient provides more discriminative capacity than the N/C ratio. The success of the scaled 2-D image features has important implications for using confocal microscopy to detect precancer in the clinic. Acquisition of the epithelial thickness or scattering coefficient requires less time than 3-D image sets and little additional effort is required to gain the added information compared to 2-D images alone."
CD011126,0,26524822,0,Hashimoto thyroiditis onset after laparoscopic removal of struma ovarii: an overview to unravel a rare and intriguing finding.,"Struma ovarii is an uncommon type of ovarian tumor derived by germinal cells, characterized by the predominance of thyroid tissue (> 50%); 90-95% of these formations are benign and mainly affect the left ovary, while in 6% of the cases struma ovarii is bilateral. The malignant transformation is a rare condition that often occurs after 50 years. In most instances, diagnosis of malignant struma ovarii is made postoperatively during histological analysis. This tumor appears to derive by one germinal cell through loss of heterozygosity of the androgen receptor gene and of the X chromosome. Clinical symptoms comprise abdominopelvic mass, lower abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and ascites (the occurrence of this condition has been observed in one-third of the cases). The patients with struma ovarii generally do not manifest symptoms related to thyroid hyperfunction, reported only in 8% of the cases, and due to hyperstimulation of the thyroid by auto-antibodies. Thyroid tissue of the struma ovarii, often embedded in a teratoma, may be papillary, follicular or with mixed pattern and it can include elements of mucinous cystoadenomas, Brenner's tumor or carcinoid or melanomas cells. Here the authors report their experience with an unusual case of Hashimoto thyroiditis onset after laparoscopic removal of struma ovarii."
CD011126,0,25246118,0,Asymptomatic adenomyosis and embryo implantation in IVF cycles.,"Research on the effect of adenomyosis on the rate of success of IVF is controversial. Differences in study design, study power, criteria and instrument used to diagnose adenomyosis and choice of controls may explain these discrepancies. To establish whether embryo implantation is impaired in women with adenomyosis, women scheduled for IVF were prospectively evaluated for the presence of adenomyosis and whether this condition affected embryo implantation. Forty-nine women with adenomyosis diagnosed at transvaginal ultrasound with no abnormal uterine bleeding were recruited. They were matched for study period, age, day of embryo transfer and number of transferred embryos to 49 controls without the disease. In women with adenomyosis, 24 out of 76 embryos transferred implanted (32%); this occurred in 16 out of 76 (21%) in unaffected controls. The crude odds ratio of implantation in affected women was 1.73 (95% CI 0.83 to 3.60). The odds ratio adjusted for body mass index (the unique variable found to differ at univariate analysis) was 1.78 (95% CI 0.85 to 3.77). In conclusion, implantation rate is not impaired in asymptomatic women who are diagnosed with adenomyosis at transvaginal sonography. Affected women can be reassured about the effect of this condition on their chances of success."

CD011126,0,21898632,0,Ultrasound scanning of the pelvis and abdomen for staging of gynecological tumors: a review.,"This Review documents examination techniques, sonographic features and clinical considerations in ultrasound assessment of gynecological tumors. The methodology of gynecological cancer staging, including assessment of local tumor extent, lymph nodes and distant metastases, is described. With increased technical quality, sonography has become an accurate staging method for early and advanced gynecological tumors. Other complementary imaging techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, can be used as an adjunct to ultrasound in specific cases, but are not essential to tumor staging if sonography is performed by a specialist in gynecological oncology. Ultrasound is established as the method of choice for evaluating local extent of endometrial cancer and is the most important imaging method for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant ovarian tumors. Ultrasound can be used to detect early as well as locally advanced cancers that extend from the vagina, cervix or other locations to the paracolpium, parametria, rectum and sigmoid colon, urinary bladder and other adjacent organs or structures. In cases of ureteric involvement, ultrasound is also helpful in locating the site of obstruction. Furthermore, it is specific for the detection of extrapelvic tumor spread to the abdominal cavity in the form of parietal or visceral carcinomatosis, omental and/or mesenteric infiltration. Ultrasound can be used to assess changes in infiltrated lymph nodes, including demonstration of characteristic sonomorphologic and vascular patterns. Vascular patterns are particularly well visualized in peripheral nodes using high resolution linear array probes or in the pelvis using high-frequency probes. The presence of peripheral or mixed vascularity or displacement of vessels seems to be the sole criterion in the diagnosis of metastatic or lymphomatous nodes. In the investigation of distant metastases, if a normal visceral organ or characteristic diffuse or focal lesions (such as a simple cyst, hepatic hemangioma, renal angiomyolipoma, fatty liver (steatosis)) are identified on ultrasound, additional examinations using complementary imaging methods are not required. If, however, less characteristic findings are encountered, especially when the examination result radically affects subsequent therapeutic management, an additional examination using a complementary imaging method (e.g. contrast-enhanced ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) is indicated."

CD011126,0,25016976,0,The effect of co-delivery of paclitaxel and curcumin by transferrin-targeted PEG-PE-based mixed micelles on resistant ovarian cancer in 3-D spheroids and in vivo tumors.,"Multicellular 3D cancer cell culture (spheroids) resemble to in vivo tumors in terms of shape, cell morphology, growth kinetics, gene expression and drug response. However, these characteristics cause very limited drug penetration into deeper parts of the spheroids. In this study, we used multi drug resistant (MDR) ovarian cancer cell spheroid and in vivo tumor models to evaluate the co-delivery of paclitaxel (PCL) and a potent NF-κB inhibitor curcumin (CUR). PCL and CUR were co-loaded into the polyethylene glycol-phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PEG-PE) based polymeric micelles modified with transferrin (TF) as the targeting ligand. Cytotoxicity, cellular association and accumulation into the deeper layers were investigated in the spheroids and compared with the monolayer cell culture. Comparing to non-targeted micelles, flow cytometry and confocal imaging proved significantly deeper and higher micelle penetration into the spheroids with TF-targeting. Both in monolayers and in spheroids, PCL cytotoxicity was significantly increased when co-delivered with CUR in non-targeted micelles or as single agent in TF-targeted micelles, whereas TF-modification of co-loaded micelles did not further enhance the cytotoxicity. In vivo tumor inhibition studies showed good correlation with the 3D cell culture experiments, which suggests the current spheroid model can be used as an intermediate model for the evaluation of co-delivery of anticancer compounds in targeted micelles."

CD011126,0,16630737,0,[Rotterdam consensus in adolescent girls: which investigations and how to interpret them to make the diagnosis of PCOS?].,"The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent cause of hyperandrogenism and anovulation in adult women as well as in adolescent girls. Since 2003 the diagnosis of PCOS has been based on the association of hyperandrogenism, oligoanovulation and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology at ultrasound (at least 2 items out of 3). In adolescents however, PCOS features may be difficult to distinguish from the symptoms of the end of puberty. Moreover, transvaginal ultrasound examination is seldom possible, and it is difficult to get precise imaging of the ovaries by abdominal route. However, the diagnosis of PCOS in a hyperandrogenic and/or oligomenorrheic adolescent requires on the strict application of the Rotterdam criteria, as in adult women. Priority should be given to clinical features whereas pelvic ultrasound must be considered as optional. Few hormonal assays will serve mainly to make the differential diagnosis, in addition to clinical findings. Once established, the diagnosis of PCOS in an adolescent girl must lead to the detection of the metabolic syndrome by means of simple investigations. This will allow early prevention of its complications."

Methods and parameters have been developed and validated from dosimetric, imaging and clinical experience from different institutions (University of Vienna, IGR Paris, University of Leuven). Cumulative dose volume histograms (DVH) are recommended for evaluation of the complex dose heterogeneity. DVH parameters for GTV, HR CTV and IR CTV are the minimum dose delivered to 90 and 100% of the respective volume: D90, D100. The volume, which is enclosed by 150 or 200% of the prescribed dose (V150, V200), is recommended for overall assessment of high dose volumes. V100 is recommended for quality assessment only within a given treatment schedule. For Organs at Risk (OAR) the minimum dose in the most irradiated tissue volume is recommended for reporting: 0.1, 1, and 2 cm3; optional 5 and 10 cm3. Underlying assumptions are: full dose of external beam therapy in the volume of interest, identical location during fractionated brachytherapy, contiguous volumes and contouring of organ walls for >2 cm3. Dose values are reported as absorbed dose and also taking into account different dose rates. The linear-quadratic radiobiological model-equivalent dose (EQD2)-is applied for brachytherapy and is also used for calculating dose from external beam therapy. This formalism allows systematic assessment within one patient, one centre and comparison between different centres with analysis of dose volume relations for GTV, CTV, and OAR. Recommendations for the transition period from traditional to 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy are formulated. Supplementary data (available in the electronic version of this paper) deals with aspects of 3D imaging, radiation physics, radiation biology, dose at reference points and dimensions and volumes for the GTV and CTV (adding to [Haie-Meder C, Pötter R, Van Limbergen E et al.

Radiother Oncol 2005;74:235-245]). It is expected that the therapeutic ratio including target coverage and sparing of organs at risk can be significantly improved, if radiation dose is prescribed to a 3D image-based CTV taking into account dose volume constraints for OAR. However, prospective use of these recommendations in the clinical context is warranted, to further explore and develop the potential of 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy."

CD011126,0,15346031,0,Ossifying fibroma of the skull: interactive image-guided minimally invasive localization and resection.,"Ossifying fibroma is a benign fibro-osseous tumor commonly affecting the craniofacial bones. It is considered to be a locally aggressive and quickly expansible bone lesion. Because of its aggressive nature and high recurrence rate, early detection and complete surgical removal are essential. Usually, these lesions are excised extensively by craniectomy, and bone loss is reconstructed by cranioplasty using acrylic resin or titanium implants. Alternatively, in the management of skull-ossifying fibroma, an image-guided technique using surgical navigation may provide precise information about localization, enabling complete removal, thereby operating with minimal exposure and within narrow resection borders and avoiding significant bone deformity. A 39-year-old male patient with a history of renal cell carcinoma was admitted to our hospital because a radionuclide scintigraphic bone scan revealed increased uptake in a small area located at the left lateral skull bone. The high-resolution computed tomography scan showed that the lesion was located inside the diploe, destroying the inner table of the calvarium. The patient underwent minimally invasive bone lesion removal using an interactive image-guided approach. Complete resection of the neoplastic lesion was achieved. The histopathological examination revealed an ossifying fibroma. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 3 days after intervention. To date, there has been no evidence of local recurrence. Interactive multimodal planning and intraoperative image guidance offer an interesting approach for biopsy and minimally invasive removal of small ossifying fibroma lesions of the skull, especially in less accessible locations."

Ultrasonography showed a right adnexal mass, probably ovarian in origin, with suspicious intratumoral bleed. The pain was treated symptomatically, and the symptoms improved. A successful induction of labour was then performed at 36 weeks gestation. The pain recurred almost immediately after the delivery, and she experienced another intra-abdominal bleed. A diagnostic laparotomy and a right salpingo-oophorectomy were performed, and the diagnosis of luteoma was made based on histology. We discuss the clinical presentation of this unusual tumour, though often asymptomatic, can rarely present with severe abdominal pain from complications like torsion with rupture, leading to massive intra-abdominal bleeding. We also discuss the possible radiological investigations which can be done during pregnancy."
CD011126,0,15949212,0,"Recombinant gonadotrophin-based, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome-free stimulation of the high responder: suggested protocol for further research.","Ovarian stimulation of the high responder remains controversial. The narrow margin between a too low gonadotrophin dose (and abnormal oestradiol rise) and excessive stimulation (risk of OHSS) is a challenging situation. This study describes an OHSS-free protocol, based on the use of recombinant gonadotrophins for stimulation and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist to prevent premature LH surge. In six patients with a previous history of excessive response, stimulation was started on day 3 of cycle with recombinant FSH. When follicular diameter reached 13-14 mm, a daily injection of GnRH antagonist was added, together with a daily dose of 75 IU of recombinant LH. When the leading follicles reached 17 mm in diameter, ovulation was triggered with a single dose of 0.2 mg triptorelin. Luteal support with vaginal oestradiol and progesterone was started on the day of oocyte retrieval. None of the patients developed clinically significant OHSS. Mean maximal oestradiol concentration was 23,209 pmol/l, and mean number of embryos obtained per patient was 20.5. Fresh embryo transfer resulted in one ongoing pregnancy and two chemical pregnancies. Thaw cycles have resulted so far in two additional ongoing pregnancies. This protocol removes the risk of OHSS and has a good clinical outcome, and therefore merits further research."

Subsequent loss of peripheral pulses and nonmeasurable arterial blood pressure have been attributed to cardiovascular collapse or hypotension. When interpreted as global hypotension, treatment with vasopressors or according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support resuscitation protocols has been associated with cardiac complications. We describe a patient who developed loss of peripheral pulses and nonmeasurable blood pressure by noninvasive means after myometrial administration of 60 U vasopressin, with documented severe peripheral arterial vasospasm and elevated proximal blood pressure. We discuss the pathophysiology and emphasize the danger of misinterpreting pulselessness as global hypotension instead of vasospasm in this setting."

CD011126,0,10384805,0,Menstrual disorders in adolescents. Excess androgens and the polycystic ovary syndrome.,"The fundamental clinical features of PCOS include hirsutism and menstrual irregularities from the time of menarche. Obesity is present in approximately 50% of these patients, some of whom also carry a diagnosis of NIDDM. The biochemical abnormalities associated with the clinical picture include LH hypersecretion, hyperandrogenism, acyclic estrogen production, subnormal SHBG levels, and hyperinsulinemia. Hirsutism usually progresses slowly in patients with PCOS; however, the clinical presentation can resemble virilizing tumors, late-onset CAH, or Cushing syndrome. Virilization or rapidly progressive hirsutism requires immediate investigation to rule out a virilizing tumor. Goals of therapy for teenage patients include decreasing levels of bioavailable androgen, blockade of androgen action at target tissues, stabilization of the endometrium, and reduction of insulin resistance. Although the original description of PCOS by Stein and Leventhal was published in 1935, the cause of PCOS remains unknown. This reason, coupled with the fact that PCOS-related insulin resistance is an important cause of NIDDM in women, has caused this disorder to become one of interest and active investigation. Future research will likely be able to delineate mechanisms behind the defects of carbohydrate metabolism and ascertain large multigeneration kindreds for linkage analyses to identify affected genes. Future studies are also likely to confirm whether young women with PCOS are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and other long-term health complications. As new pathophysiologic mechanisms are identified, the promise of new therapies arises, including treatments that could potentially reduce the long-term incidence of adverse health consequences."

CD011126,0,22019621,0,Laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas negatively affects ovarian follicular reserve even if performed by experienced surgeons.,"In order to estimate the impact of laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas on the ovarian follicular reserve, 43 normo-ovulatory women were studied by endocrine (anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), FSH, LH, inhibin B, oestradiol) and ultrasonographic (antral follicle count (AFC)) methods before surgery, and 3 and 9 months after surgery. The operation was performed by experienced laparoscopists, particularly aware of the need to avoid damaging the healthy part of the ovary. Serum AMH concentrations significantly decreased after the operation (1.4±0.2 ng/ml after 3 months and 1.3±0.3 ng/ml after 9 months versus 3.0±0.4 ng/ml before surgery; P<0.0001), whereas basal FSH, LH, oestradiol and inhibin B concentrations remained unchanged. The volume of the operated ovary significantly diminished after surgery (P<0.0001), whereas the AFC was not significantly altered. Overall, the data show that laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas reduces ovarian reserve. The significant decrease of AMH after surgery confirms that part of the healthy ovarian pericapsular tissue, containing primordial and preantral follicles, is removed or damaged despite all the surgical efforts to be atraumatic. This must be carefully considered when laparoscopic cystectomy surgery is scheduled for patients with no relevant symptoms besides infertility or with already small ovarian reserve."

CD011126,0,16118790,0,Dermal fibroblasts cultured on small intestinal submucosa: Conditions for the formation of a neotissue.,"Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring, acellular biomaterial that has been used extensively as a soft tissue replacement, as a scaffold for tissue engineering, and as a substrate for the study of cells in 3D culture. The aim of this study is to define culture parameters that promote neotissue formation with the use of dermal fibroblasts and SIS. SIS sheets were seeded with dermal fibroblasts and cultured for 4 weeks. The resultant cell-scaffold composites (CSCs) were cultured with media alone, media supplemented with ascorbic acid, or fibronectin-pretreated SIS and ascorbic acid. CSCs were analyzed for cellular invasion into the scaffold, the rate of type I collagen production, MMP gelatinolytic activity, thickness, and ultrastructural morphology. CSCs treated with fibronectin and ascorbate showed an increase in Type I collagen production, no change in the MMP gelatinolytic activity, an increase in CSC thickness, and an organized neotissue on the surface of the SIS. Minimal cellular invasion was noted, suggesting that fibroblasts use the SIS as a template for neotissue growth rather than as a scaffold. These results indicate that fibronectin-treated SIS cultured with dermal fibroblasts in the presence of ascorbic acid will promote true neotissue formation for future cardiovascular tissue engineering efforts."

It was radiologically interpreted as a cystic mass with differential diagnosis including echinococcal cyst, biliary cystadenoma, and malignant neoplasm. The cystic mass was intraoperatively aspirated and a liquid-based cytology preparation (ThinPrep) and a cell block were made. The ThinPrep slides showed three dimensional clusters of epithelioid cells with scant delicate cytoplasm and tissue fragments composed of small stromal cells with round to oval shaped nuclei and a small amount of dense cytoplasm lined by the cuboidal epithelial cells. Occasional ciliated cells and abundant hemosiderin laden macrophages were also present. The cell block showed many tissue fragments containing glands and stroma with associated hemorrhage and hemosiderin laden macrophages, typical of endometrial tissue.

Hydatidiform moles should be regarded as premalignant lesions because 15-20% of complete hydatidiform moles (CHMs) and 1% of partial hydatidiform moles (PHMs) undergo malignant transformation into invasive moles, choriocarcinomas, or, in rare cases, placental-site trophoblastic tumors (PSTTs). We will illustrate the case of a 26-year-old nulliparous with a seven weeks amenorrhea, positive immunological pregnancy test, a β-HCG value of 136 000 mIU÷mL and minor vaginal bleeding. The ultrasonographic examination showed an enlarged endometrium with adjacent hyperechoic material containing tiny anechoic spaces and an anembryonic pregnancy, distended endometrial cavity containing innumerable, variably sized anechoic cysts with intervening hyperechoic material (""snowstorm"" appearance). The CT showed a uterine mass measuring 89÷111÷67 mm, inhomogeneous density, proliferative-infiltrative endocavitary tissue without exceeding the peritoneal serosa, and a few pulmonary micronodules with not certain origin on the left inferior lobe.

This was a prospective randomized trial at a single academic IVF centre. Seventy-seven patients undergoing artificial cycles received oral oestradiol; patients with endometrium < 7 mm on day 9-10 were switched to vaginal oestradiol. Eighty-six patients undergoing stimulated cycles received recombinant FSH followed by human gonadotrophin hormone injection. Vaginal progesterone was begun 2 or 3 days prior to embryo transfer. There was no difference in implantation rate (8.5% versus 7.3%), pregnancy rate (16% versus 13%), cancellation rate (both 23%) or endometrium thickness (8.7 +/- 1.1 mm versus 8.7 +/- 1.0 mm) between artificial and stimulated cycles. Stimulated cycles had a higher incidence of thin endometrium (27% versus 5%, P < 0.01). In artificial cycles, patients switched to vaginal oestradiol had improved pregnancy rate (31%) versus patients who received oral oestradiol alone (13%) (P = 0.05). It is concluded that artificial and stimulated cycles produce comparable pregnancy rates, implantation rates, cancellation rates and endometrial thickness, although stimulated cycles have a higher incidence of thin endometrium. Vaginal oestradiol supplementation improved implantation rates."

Intriguingly, interaction with the DPC micelles affected the structures of SHH and retro-SHH very differently. In fact, micelles induce pronounced folding of retro-SHH, whereas micelle-bound SHH was noticeably disordered. Finally, we performed a disorder prediction with the PONDR-FIT algorithm and discovered that the reversal of the chain direction almost does not affect the propensity of a polypeptide for intrinsic disorder, since the disorder plot for retro-SHH was almost a mirror image of that for the normal SHH."
CD011126,0,17097570,0,A new technique to obtain endometrial directed biopsy during sonohysterography: the NiGo device.,"The primary goal of the clinical evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding is to establish a specific diagnosis in the most efficient and least invasive manner possible. Hysteroscopy (HS) allows physicians to obtain directed biopsy in addition to direct visualization of the uterine cavity and lesions, but often requires ambulatory surgery centers and some anesthesia, or can potentially result in significant patient discomfort. Sonohysterography (SHG) is less invasive than HS but does not allow a histologic sample. A new technique, called the Nicoletti-Gorlero (NiGo) device, was developed and evaluated to obtain histologic results during SHG. This study is a prospective, observational evaluation between the NiGo device technique and standard HS to obtain endometrial samples. The NiGo device was used to obtain an endometrial sample during SHG in 18 women. In a subsequent session, HS was performed to verify the results. From January 2005 through November 2005 both procedures (SHG + biopsy and HS) were performed on 18 patients. The SHG procedures using the NiGo forcep were performed successfully on 15 out of 18 women, and the endometrial sample was obtained in 14 out of 15 patients. In one patient, the endometrial biopsy obtained provided too little tissue to accomplish histologic evaluation. All 13 pathologic results obtained with the NiGo device were identical with those subsequently obtained with HS. The office-based HS procedure was not successful in two women; in these women, an HS procedure performed in the operating room was necessary. The NiGo device technique allows the physician to obtain sonographic-guided biopsies of the entire endometrium during SHG. The technique is less invasive compared with HS. In our small series, there were no complications during the procedure."

However, there is a dearth of medical literature describing fertility-preserving treatments when standard therapy fails. We present two cases in which protracted retained placenta due to placenta accreta was successfully treated by hysteroscopic resection. Two nulliparous women had spontaneous vaginal deliveries requiring manual placental extraction. Both experienced delayed postpartum hemorrhage and underwent suction curettage with ultrasound guidance. Both patients were found to have persistent products of conception with imaging consistent with placenta accreta. Both patients failed expectant management and subsequently underwent hysteroscopic resection with complete resolution of their symptoms. We conclude that hysteroscopic resection is a conservative therapeutic option for placenta accreta in stable patients."

In only 5 % of cases, spontaneous closure with bladder catheterization over weeks and hormonal management is possible, most of the time a surgical procedure is the definitive treatment. Until now, the resection of this kind of fistula was performed using a transabdominal approach most of the time. Our procedure describes a surgical repair using a transvaginal approach by exciding the fistula out of the bladder and uterus with primary closure. In this way, a recurrent laparotomy with all known associated risks could be avoided. However, after definitive treatment of the fistula, a new pregnancy should be delivered by performing a caesarean section. In this way, a rupture of the uterus during delivery could be prevented."

The group of 54 patients analyzed consisted of 30 women (56%) and 24 men (44%). Most (59%) had solitary polyps. In 92.6% of patients the size of polyps was below 10 mm. 74% of respondents were over 50 years. Ultrasonography is the method of choice and gold standard in diagnosis of gallbladder polyps. Based on echoic properties cholesterol polyps can not be distinguished from adenomas. Malignant alteration of polyps also could not be detected. Appropriate ultrasonographic characteristics such as size of polyps, appearance of a broad base that sits on the wall, concomitant lithiasis findings and patient age may be indicative for malignancy."

CD011126,0,25615775,0,High-resolution sonography for distinguishing neoplastic gallbladder polyps and staging gallbladder cancer.,"OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to compare staging accuracy of high-resolution sonography (HRUS) with combined low- and high-MHz transducers with that of conventional sonography for gallbladder cancer and to investigate the differences in the imaging findings of neoplastic and nonneoplastic gallbladder polyps. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Our study included 37 surgically proven gallbladder cancer (T1a = 7, T1b = 2, T2 = 22, T3 = 6), including 15 malignant neoplastic polyps and 73 surgically proven polyps (neoplastic = 31, nonneoplastic = 42) that underwent HRUS and conventional transabdominal sonography. Two radiologists assessed T-category and predefined polyp findings on HRUS and conventional transabdominal sonography. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square and McNemar tests. RESULTS. The diagnostic accuracy for the T category was T1a = 92-95%, T1b = 89-95%, T2 = 78-86%, and T3 = 84-89%, all with good agreement (κ = 0.642) using HRUS. The diagnostic accuracy for differentiating T1 from T2 or greater than T2 was 92% and 89% on HRUS and 65% and 70% with conventional transabdominal sonography. Statistically common findings for neoplastic polyps included size greater than 1 cm, single lobular surface, vascular core, hypoechoic polyp, and hypoechoic foci (p < 0.05). The value of HRUS in the differential diagnosis of a gallbladder polyp was more clearly depicted internal echo foci than conventional transabdominal sonography (39 vs 21). A polyp size greater than 1 cm was independently associated with a neoplastic polyp (odds ratio = 7.5, p = 0.02). The AUC of a polyp size greater than 1 cm was 0.877. The sensitivity and specificity were 66.67% and 89.13%, respectively. CONCLUSION. HRUS is a simple method that enables accurate T categorization of gallbladder carcinoma. It provides high-resolution images of gallbladder polyps and may have a role in stratifying the risk for malignancy."

Twelve females with a clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic diagnosis of PCOS were randomly assigned to endurance and resistance exercise plus nutritional counseling (EN) or nutritional counseling only (N) for a period of 12 weeks. Anthropometry, resting metabolic rate (RMR), selected hormones, and ovarian follicle population were measured pre and post-intervention. Following the 12 week intervention, greater decreases in sum of 2 skinfolds (p = 0.002) and a greater increase in estimated VO2 max (p = 0.017) occurred in the exercise group. Significant decreases in waist girth (p = 0.001) and insulin levels (p = 0.03) occurred in both groups. Hormonal changes were not statistically significant; however, a trend towards an improved hormonal profile, specifically sex-hormone binding globulin (EN, 39% increase; N, 8% increase) and lutenizing hormone : follicle-stimulating hormone (LH:FSH) (EN, 9% decrease; N, 27% decrease) occurred in the absence of weight loss.

We report a 31-year-old woman who developed choroidal metastasis following conservative management of early-stage endometrial carcinoma. She had received kidney transplantation and was taking steroids and cyclosporine. Three years after hysterectomy for persistent endometrial carcinoma, she developed multiple metastatic disease (to both lungs and right pelvis), and while on treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin, she complained of a rapid visual deterioration. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed a metastatic choroidal tumor associated with multiple central nervous system metastases. The patient refused further treatment and died 1 month after diagnosis of choroidal involvement. In conclusion, this is the first reported case of choroidal metastasis from endometrial cancer and highlights the need to consider immunosuppressive treatment as an absolute contraindication to conservative fertility-sparing treatment in gynecological malignancies."

Material comprises 40 patients with pathology of gall bladder diagnosed in US examination. 10 patients from this group with gall bladder cholesterol polyps diagnosed in US were included into the study. In each patient supplementary US examination in the harmonic mode was performed. The quality of images in the harmonic mode was better. The walls of the gall bladder were more distinct. The polyps were more evident on harmonic images. THI enable more precise measurements of the polyps. In three cases in the standard mode the inspissated bile was found in gall bladder, and in those patients polyps were difficult to assess. Examination of those patients in the harmonic mode excluded the presence of the bile sludge, and facilitates the assessment of the polyps. In four patients on harmonic images more polyps were found than in the standard mode. In the harmonic mode the level of artifacts generated by the body wall is reduced and contrast resolution is increased due to reduction in noise level. The visualization of gallbladder is improved in the harmonic mode. The assessment of gallbladder polyps in the harmonic mode is easier. The polyps are easily seen, assessment of their margins and size is facilitated by harmonic imaging. The number of polyps revealed in US examination is larger in the harmonic mode."

A total of 686 women with adnexal masses underwent the examinations between 1994 and 2002. The recorded parameters included: age, menopausal status, body mass index, the grayscale and Doppler ultrasonographic examination, and selected markers concentration levels. In order to find the best combination of features, which significantly influences the probability of malignancy, stepwise logistic regression analysis, as well as artificial neural network, was used. The diagnostic efficiency of received models was estimated and compared using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The results indicate that 431 and 255 patients had a benign and malignant ovarian tumor, respectively. Application of stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed statistically significant importance of eight features. The sensitivity and specificity for the received model were 65.71% and 77.59%, respectively. Three-layer perceptron network shows 13 features as significant predictors of malignancy. The network gave a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 93.1%. Comparison of area under ROC curve for received models was 0.9679 vs 0.9716.

Studies published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals were systematically searched using Cochrane and Medline. Keywords used included ""alternatives to hysterectomy,"" ""endometrial ablation,"" ""uterine fibroid embolization,"" ""uterine artery embolization,"" and ""focused ultrasound."" Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed and analyzed for themes and similarities. All three alternative methods of treatment reviewed are currently approved for use in the United States and abroad. In fact, five different global endometrial ablation devices are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of menorrhagia. Patient satisfaction scores after endometrial ablation are high (90%-95%), but amenorrhea rates are much lower (15%-60%). Data from randomized trials demonstrate that uterine fibroid embolization results in a shorter hospital stay and quicker return to work as compared with abdominal hysterectomy for leiomyomas, but after embolization, up to 20% of women need a second procedure. Ex-ablative therapy of leiomyomas with focused ultrasound is the newest of the three methods. It has a special set of patient selection criteria and is only available at less than 20 medical centers in the United States. Leiomyoma symptom relief after focused ultrasound therapy at 1 year post-procedure is high (85%-95%). There are many effective alternatives to hysterectomy in women with menorrhagia and/or symptomatic leiomyomas. However, because these procedures are performed by individuals from different subspecialists, primarily gynecologists and interventional radiologists, clinicians must consider using a multidisciplinary approach to find the best procedure for a given patient. There are no randomized trials comparing uterine fibroid embolization to vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopic hysterectomy, or laparoscopic myomectomy."

Of the neoplastic lesions, 62.5% were germ cell tumors, 20.8% were epithelial and 16.7% were sex cord-stromal tumors. Of the neoplastic tumors, 95.8% were benign while 4.2% were malignant. Procedures included 30 operative laparoscopies (68.20%) and 14 exploratory laparotomies (31.8%). Simple excision of the ovarian cyst was performed in 39 cases (88.6%). According to our study, most of the adolescents with an ovarian cyst underwent an operation because of a neoplastic lesion. The majority of ovarian tumors occurring in adolescents are non-epithelial in origin, and germ cell tumors are the most common histological type. Ultrasound examination is one of the most important diagnostic tools. Preoperative diagnostic approach of these patients should always include careful history taking, physical examination, imaging and evaluation of serum assays. Gynecologists who care for young girls must be familiar with the differential diagnosis of ovarian masses whose surgical treatment should be conservative when appropriate, so that hormonal status and future fertility are not compromised in this group of patients."

CD011126,0,15814398,0,Follicle tracking of women receiving clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction.,"Forty-five cycles of forty subfertile women were monitored with follicle tracking. Thirty women were anovulatory and 10 had unexplained infertility. Thirty women responded to the initial dose of Clomiphene Citrate (CC) and 10 remained anovulatory. Of those who ovulated with the first dose of CC, 25 developed one follicle, 2 developed 2 follicles and 3 developed three follicles. All the women that produced three follicles belonged in the unexplained infertility group. Eight women from the anovulatory group developed 1 follicle, two developed 2 follicles and 8 failed to respond. Provision of universal follicle tracking proved to be time consuming and required significant resources. Our results indicate that if there is a place for selective monitoring that should include women with unexplained infertility. We should also offer the first scan at around day 12 of the cycle as this could detect multiple follicle development. Patients with Polycystic Ovaries that start on 50 mgs of CC may not necessarily need follicle tracking as they usually do not respond to that dose."

The performance of agarose-based constructs which contained either a single cell suspension of GLUTag-INS cells, a suspension of pre-aggregated GLUTag-INS spheroids, or GLUTag-INS cells on small intestinal submucosa (SIS), was evaluated in vitro for total cell number, weekly glucose consumption and insulin secretion rates (GCR and ISR), and induced insulin secretion function. The three types of TEPS studied displayed similar number of cells, GCR, and ISR throughout 4 weeks of culture. However, the TEPS, which incorporated SIS as a substrate for the GLUTag-INS cells, was the only type of TEPS tested which was able to retain the induced insulin secretion function of non-encapsulated GLUTag-INS cells. Though improvements in the expression level of GLUTag-INS cells and/or the number of viable cells contained within the TEPS are needed for successful treatment of a murine model of IDD, this study has revealed a potential method for promoting proper cellular function of recombinant L-cells upon incorporation into an implantable three-dimensional TEPS."

In normogonadotropic anovulatory infertile women [World Health Organization (WHO) class 2], the number of early antral follicles is usually increased. To investigate whether AMH concentrations are increased, serum levels in 128 WHO 2 women were compared with those in 41 normoovulatory premenopausal women of similar age. Serum AMH concentrations are significantly (P < 0.001) elevated in WHO 2 patients [median, 7.6 micro g/liter (range, 0.1-40.0)], compared with controls [median, 2.1 micro g/liter (0.1-7.4)]. In 106 patients presenting with polycystic ovaries (PCOs) (>/=="" BORDER=""0"">12 follicles/ovary measuring 2-9 mm and/or an ovarian volume > 10 ml), AMH levels were elevated [9.3 micro g/liter (1.8-40.0)], compared with 22 patients without PCOs [6.4 micro g/liter (0.1-22.1)] (P < 0.0001). In WHO 2 patients, AMH concentrations correlated with features characteristic for polycystic ovary syndrome such as LH concentrations (r = 0.331; P = 0.0001), testosterone levels (r = 0.477, P = 0.0001), mean ovarian volume (r = 0.421; P = 0.0001), and the number of ovarian follicles (r = 0.308; P = 0.0001). AMH levels correlated well with age in WHO 2 patients (r = -0.248; P = 0.002) as well as in controls (r = -0.465; P = 0.005). However, the relative decline in AMH with age is less pronounced in WHO 2 patients. In a subset of patients no significant correlation was found between AMH serum concentrations and the FSH response dose, the duration of stimulation, and the total number of ampoules of FSH used. In conclusion, serum AMH concentrations are elevated in WHO 2 women, especially in those patients exhibiting PCOs. Because AMH concentrations correlated well with other clinical, endocrine, and ultrasound markers associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, AMH may be used as a marker for the extent of the disease. A less pronounced AMH decrease over time in these women may suggest retarded ovarian aging. The latter hypothesis, however, should be confirmed by longitudinal studies."

CD011126,0,21184033,0,[Postpartum eclampsia and fulminant HELLP syndrome].,"Postpartum onset of eclampsia and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome is a rare but life-threatening complication for both mother and fetus. A case of a 38-year-old parturient (gravida 2, para 1) who was asymptomatic prior to delivery is reported. Emergency caesarean section had to be performed due to sudden onset of fetal bradycardia as a result of partial placental separation. The perioperative course was characterized by new onset hypertension, nausea and restlessness; within 2 h the patient suffered a generalized seizure which was treated with magnesium sulfate and hydralazine. Despite management in accordance with current guidelines, the condition deteriorated with hypotension, anemia and renal failure. On further examination hematomas in the abdominal cavity and walls were identified and laboratory tests confirmed HELLP syndrome with severe coagulopathy. Explorative laparotomy revealed diffuse bleeding without a significant isolated source or postpartum uterine hemorrhage. Retrospectively, the anemia could be ascribed to severe hemolysis and diffuse bleeding from coagulopathy. The patient required packed red cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex. After admission to the intensive care unit persistent diffuse bleeding mainly caused by hyperfibrinolysis and renal failure occurred, which required blood transfusion, antifibrinolytic (tranexamic acid) and renal replacement therapy (continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration with citrate) for 6 days. The patient recovered without any sequelae and was discharged 26 days later. Placental separation with new onset peripartum hypertension is to be interpreted as a precursor of severe gestosis and associated complications, especially disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure and pleural effusion. A differentiation between a rapid drop in hemoglobin concentration secondary to hemolysis in postpartum HELLP syndrome rather than postpartum hemorrhage can be challenging. In addition, HELLP syndrome can lead to rapidly developing, fulminant hyperfibrinolysis in the context of DIC. Keys to successful management of postpartum gestosis and associated complications are early detection and perception of clinical and laboratory warning signs, a multidisciplinary approach with rapid and consistent targeted symptomatic therapy to save the mother and fetus."

This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of HE4 in the pre-operative diagnosis of ovarian cancer and the predictive values of biomarkers, ultrasound and CT-scan and combinations hereof."
CD011126,0,25333170,0,Real-time visualisation and analysis of internal examinations--seeing the unseen.,"Internal examinations such as Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) and bimanual Vaginal Examination (BVE) are routinely performed for early diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. Although they are recognised as core skills to be taught on a medical curriculum, they are difficult to learn and teach due to their unsighted nature. We present a framework that combines a visualisation and analysis tool with position and pressure sensors to enable the study of internal examinations and provision of real-time feedback. This approach is novel as it allows for real-time continuous trajectory and pressure data to be obtained for the complete examination, which may be used for teaching and assessment. Experiments were conducted performing DRE and BVE on benchtop models, and BVE on Gynaecological Teaching Assistants (GTA). The results obtained suggest that the proposed methodology may provide an insight into what constitutes an adequate DRE or BVE, provide real-time feedback tools for learning and assessment, and inform haptics-based simulator design."

CD011126,0,16373245,0,Efficacy and safety of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in hormone replacement therapy.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy (in terms of induction of uterine bleeding) and safety (in terms of absence of endometrial hyperplasia) of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17alpha-HPC) in a therapeutic regimen for hormonal replacement after menopause. Fifty postmenopausal patients received hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for 24 weeks. The treatment regimen consisted of standard estrogen replacement therapy at commonly prescribed doses for the prevention of climacteric symptoms and 341 mg of 17alpha-HPC every 30 days. Enrolled women were told to expect withdrawal bleeding 7-10 days after the administration of 17alpha-HPC. Forty-eight patients completed the trial. In 91.7% of cases, patients experienced the expected pattern, i.e., strict withdrawal bleeding exclusive of any other form of bleeding. Breakthrough bleeding and/or other forms of abnormal bleeding affected only four women. At the 6th month none of the endometrial samplings motivated by endometrial thickness >10 mm and evidence of heterogeneous echogenicity (two cases) was positive for carcinoma. No biopsies had to be performed at the end of the 12th month of treatment. No serious adverse effect where recorded during the study period. In conclusion, our data show the efficacy and safety of 17alpha-HPC in HRT."

We report the cases of two relatively young postmenopausal patients, who presented with vaginal bleeding, due to endometrial pathology, approximately 1 year after the initiation of raloxifene administration. The women were 43 and 44 years old, and received 60 mg/day of oral raloxifene for 11.5 and 10.5 months, respectively. In both cases, raloxifene was given for osteoporosis prevention in the absence of vasomotor symptoms. The first patient underwent Pipelle-biopsy and hysteroscopy with histopathology revealing simple endometrial hyperplasia. The second patient underwent hysteroscopy with removal of an endometrial polyp, with no histopathological signs of malignancy. Continuation of raloxifene administration was decided in both cases, and follow-up did not reveal any sign of recurrence. Uterine bleeding may rarely occur in postmenopausal women under raloxifene therapy. Patients should be encouraged to report bleeding or spotting and appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic management should follow as in any other case."

This study was assessed to evaluate the differences in clinical characteristics between young and elderly patients with varicocoele by retrospective chart review. Between June 2003 and February 2011, 169 young (18-30 years) men and 156 elderly (45-55 years) men with varicocoele, and 30 age-matched men without varicocoele were recruited for this study. All the patients were divided into six groups. Thirty-one infertile patients were assigned to Group 1, 138 fertile patients to Group 2, 35 infertile patients to Group 3 and 121 fertile patients to Group 4. Group 5 (15 young) and 6 (15 elderly) were control groups. The parameters for comparison included body mass index (BMI), semen quality (sperm motility, morphology and density) and pH value, serum concentration of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormones (LH), testosterone, testicular volume, grade of varicocoele and peak retrograde flow (PRF) and maximal vein diameter (MVD) by colour Doppler ultrasound (CDS). Elderly men with varicocoele had a higher incidence of bilateral varicocoele (25.5% vs. 14.8%), but a lower incidence of unilateral right varicocoele (2.6% vs. 7.7%) than young patients with varicocoele. In addition, patients with varicocoele had lower BMI than those without, and infertile young patients with varicocoele had the lowest levels of BMI. Furthermore, infertile patients (Groups 1 and 3) with varicocoele had significantly lower testicular volume and semen pH, lower levels of testosterone, higher levels of FSH and LH and higher PRF than fertile men with varicocoele (Groups 2 and 4). In conclusion, infertile elderly patients with varicocoele had significantly lower levels of testosterone and higher levels of FSH and LH than infertile young men with varicocoele. In addition, infertile elderly patients with bilateral varicocoele (Group 3, n = 8) had the lowest levels of testosterone."

Only 2% of adnexal masses or malignant or bordeline tumors. Does Doppler US improve the diagnostic accuracy of sonography? The purpose of this article is to review current data and identify what areas still require further evaluation with regards to Doppler characterization of adnexal masses. It has been shown that Doppler evaluation of the ovary and cyst or tumor improves the diagnostic accuracy of US to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Hemodynamic data collected from pulsed Doppler imaging and Doppler energy vascular mapping have been shown to improve the characterization of malignant lesions. These data improve the accuracy of B-mode US combined with clinical evaluation and CA125 measurement. Nonetheless, the sensitivity and specificity values are between 85-90%, with few missed malignancies, but several false positive results. Useful Doppler data include the resistive index and the central intratumoral location of vascular flow. The use of 3D US with computer post-processing as well as sonographic contrast agents could provide additional information, but these techniques have not yet been validated. All suspicious adnexal lesions should be evaluated by an experienced sonographer and include discriminatory parameters to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions."

CD011126,0,16724342,0,Application of modern imaging methods in diagnosis of gallbladder cancer.,"The poor prognosis of gallbladder cancer (GBC) is related to its dissemination capacity and usually late diagnosis due to its non-specific clinical appearance. Recent improvements in hepatobiliary surgery have underlined the importance of an early specific diagnosis, which requires a multidisciplinary approach and, when possible, specialized equipment. The first step in an early diagnosis is to identify patients in the appropriate epidemiological setting (e.g., incidental finding, chronic cholecystitis) for the correct interpretation of test results. It is desirable to enhance the sensitivity of the initial ultrasound (US) examination by use of the appropriate technology in skilled specialist hands. When GBC is suggested by US findings, FDG-PET can be considered complementary to establish the benign/malignant nature of the lesion and to obtain a primary staging study. If GBC is confirmed, thin slice spiral CT can contribute valuable information on local spread. In this regard, recent hybrid PET-CT systems provide structural and functional information simultaneously and may offer early and accurate T, N, and M staging with an improved specificity."

CD011126,0,24910933,0,Contrast ultrasonography for tubal patency.,"Evaluation of tubal patency is an essential part of a fertility workup. Laparoscopy with chromopertubation in conjunction with hysteroscopy is the gold standard in evaluation of tubal patency and the uterine cavity. In this review article we describe a newer method for evaluation of the uterus and fallopian tubes, that is, hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy). Accuracy of HyCoSy for tubal patency has been shown to be comparable to that with hysterosalpingography (HSG) when compared with laparoscopic chromopertubation. Sensitivity ranges from 75% to 96%, and specificity from 67% to 100%. HyCoSy is also accurate when compared with HSG in determining tubal occlusion after hysteroscopic sterilization, with 88% of patients stating they would prefer to undergo the tubal occlusion test in their gynecologist's office. Because HyCoSy also includes evaluation of the uterine cavity with saline solution-enhanced sonohysterography, accuracy in evaluating the uterine cavity is >90% when compared with hysteroscopy. HyCoSy enables the gynecologist to complete a fertility workup in the office in the most minimally invasive way. HyCoSy is well tolerated and has been suggested in the literature to replace HSG for evaluation of tubal disease in the subfertile population."

CD011126,0,24835180,0,Tumor sensitive matching flow: A variational method to detecting and segmenting perihepatic and perisplenic ovarian cancer metastases on contrast-enhanced abdominal CT.,"Accurate automated segmentation and detection of ovarian cancer metastases may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of women with ovarian cancer. In this paper, we focus on an important subset of ovarian cancer metastases that spread to the surface of the liver and spleen. Automated ovarian cancer metastasis detection and segmentation are very challenging problems to solve. These metastases have a wide variety of shapes and intensity values similar to that of the liver, spleen and adjacent soft tissues. To address these challenges, this paper presents a variational approach, called tumor sensitive matching flow (TSMF), to detect and segment perihepatic and perisplenic ovarian cancer metastases. TSMF is an image motion field that only highlights metastasis-caused deformation on the surface of liver and spleen while dampening all other image motion between the patient image and the atlas image. It provides several benefits: (1) juxtaposing the roles of image matching and metastasis classification within a variational framework; (2) only requiring a small set of features from a few patient images to train a metastasis-likelihood function for classification; and (3) dynamically creating shape priors for geodesic active contour (GAC) to prevent inaccurate metastasis segmentation. We compared the TSMF to an organ surface partition (OSP) baseline approach. At a false positive rate of 2 per patient, the sensitivities of TSMF and OSP were 87% and 17% (p<0.001), respectively. In a comparison of the segmentations conducted using TSMF-constrained GAC and conventional GAC, the volume overlap rates were 73 ± 9% and 46 ± 26% (p<0.001) and average surface distances were 2.4 ± 1.2 mm and 7.0 ± 6.0 mm (p<0.001), respectively. These encouraging results demonstrate that TSMF could accurately detect and segment ovarian cancer metastases."

Theoretical characterization of heating patterns was performed to identify implant strategies for these devices which can best be used to apply hyperthermia to cervical cancer. A constrained optimization-based hyperthermia treatment planning platform was used for the analysis. The proportion of tissue ≥41 °C in a hyperthermia treatment volume was maximized with constraints T(max) ≤ 47 °C, T(rectum) ≤ 41.5 °C, and T(bladder) ≤ 42.5 °C. Hyperthermia treatment was modeled for generalized implant configurations and complex configurations from a database of patients (n = 14) treated with HDR brachytherapy. Various combinations of endocervical (360° or 2 × 180° output; 6 mm OD) and interstitial (180°, 270°, or 360° output; 2.4 mm OD) applicators within catheter locations from brachytherapy implants were modeled, with perfusion constant (1 or 3 kg m(-3) s(-1)) or varying with location or temperature. Device positioning, sectoring, active length and aiming were empirically optimized to maximize thermal coverage. Conformable heating of appreciable volumes (>200 cm(3)) is possible using multiple sectored interstitial and endocervical ultrasound devices. The endocervical device can heat >41 °C to 4.6 cm diameter compared to 3.6 cm for the interstitial. Sectored applicators afford tight control of heating that is robust to perfusion changes in most regularly spaced configurations. T(90) in example patient cases was 40.5-42.7 °C (1.9-39.6 EM(43 °C)) at 1 kg m(-3) s(-1) with 10/14 patients ≥41 °C. Guidelines are presented for positioning of implant catheters during the initial surgery, selection of ultrasound applicator configurations, and tailored power schemes for achieving T(90) ≥ 41 °C in clinically practical implant configurations. Catheter-based ultrasound devices, when adhering to the guidelines, show potential to generate conformal therapeutic heating ranging from a single endocervical device targeting small volumes local to the cervix (<2 cm radial) to a combination of a 2 × 180° endocervical and directional interstitial applicators in the lateral periphery to target much larger volumes (6 cm radial), while preferentially limiting heating of the bladder and rectum."
CD011126,0,24623297,0,"Decision for surgery in the management of a rare condition, childhood gallbladder polyps, and the role of ultrasonography.","Gallbladder polyps are tumors or tumor-like protrusions of the gallbladder. They are rarely seen in the pediatric age. Most important issue about these mostly incidental lesions is the risk of malignant transformation. Size more than 10 mm is the classicalcutoff for determining this risk, but it is rarely valid in children. Ultrasonography is the method of choice for follow-up, but it rarely demonstrates change of size or malignant transformation. Hereby, we report 6 cases of childhood gallbladder polyps, none of which had a genetic risk factor. Follow-up was uneventful in 4 of them. Two patients had undergone surgery, but none of the lesions were neoplastic. In the follow-up, a single experienced radiologist should handle the patient, in order to prevent inter-observer variation. The cut-off size for deciding surgery should be 10 mm for those cases with genetic background creating malignancy risk (metachromatic leukodystrophy, pancreaticobiliary duct abnormalities, achondroplasia, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome) or with accompanying cholelithiasis, and 15 mm for those without any risk factors to prevent any unnecessary operations."

Its main action is as an anti-oestrogen, but in the endometrium of some patients it acts as an oestrogen. Some investigators have even reported an increased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma. The question of how to follow-up these patients and how to identify patients at risk of developing endometrial premalignant changes was investigated by the noninvasive ultrasound method. The follow-up of 292 patients from before the start of adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen and 94 without tamoxifen treatment was conducted at regular intervals. The changes in endometrial thickness as measured by ultrasound and histopathological changes are reported. A thicker endometrium was found in patients with receptor positive breast cancer even before the treatment with tamoxifen started. Cumulative increasing thickness was found during treatment and this thicker endometrium remained until almost 3 years after the end of treatment. If the endometrium was <3 mm after 3 months of treatment the probability that it would be thin after 5 years was high. An increased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma was found, however due to this regular follow-up the cancer was identified at an early stage."

CD011126,0,15923127,0,Classification of single-projection reconstructions for cryo-electron microscopy data of icosahedral viruses.,"We present a novel strategy for classification of heterogeneous electron microscopy data of icosahedral virus particles. The effectiveness of the procedure, which is based on classification of single-projection reconstructions (SPRs), is first investigated using simulated data. Of several reconstruction approaches examined, best results were obtained with algebraic reconstruction techniques (ART) when providing prior information about the reconstruction in the form of a starting volume. The results presented indicate that SPR-classification is sufficiently sensitive to classify assemblies with differences of only a few percent of the total mass. The usefulness of this procedure is illustrated by application to a heterogeneous cryo-electron microscopy dataset of adenovirus mutant dl313, lacking minor coat protein IX. These data were successfully divided into two distinct classes, in agreement with gel analysis and immuno-electron microscopy results. The classes yielded a wildtype-like reconstruction and a reconstruction representing the polypeptide IX-deficient dl313 virion. As the largest difference between these volumes is found at the location previously assigned to the external portion of minor coat protein polypeptide IIIa, questions arise concerning the current adenovirus model."

The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of instruction of PFM and TrA contraction on constriction of the levator hiatus, using 4D perineal ultrasonography. Thirteen women with pelvic organ prolapse participated in the study. Perineal ultrasound in standing position was used to assess constriction of the levator hiatus. Analyses were conducted off-line with measurements in the axial plane of minimal hiatal dimensions. The reduction of all the hiatal dimensions was significantly greater during PFM than TrA contraction. All patients had a reduction of the levator hiatus area during PFM contraction (mean reduction 24.0%; range 6.1-49.2%). In two patients, there was an increase of the levator hiatus area during TrA contraction. Instruction of PFM contraction is more effective than TrA contraction."

Twenty PCOS women who did not respond to CC were enrolled in the study. All received 500-1500 mg/day of metformin for 4 weeks. If no dominant follicle was observed with monitoring by transvaginal ultrasound, 50-150 mg of CC per day for 5 days were added. Timing of sexual intercourse was determined or intrauterine insemination was carried out 36 h after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin. A total of six cycles, pregnancy or anovulation despite taking 150 mg of CC were considered as completion of the study. Blood samples were obtained before and at the end of the 4th week of treatment for hormonal assay. Ovulation was observed in 68 (89.5%) of 76 cycles, of which 34 (44.7%) occurred with metformin alone. Twelve women conceived; therefore, the pregnancy rate was 17.6% per ovulated cycle and 60% per woman. One (8.3%) had an abortion. Four women had minimal adverse effect, but one experienced a severe gastrointestinal effect during the fourth cycle. Insulin and androstenedione levels were significantly decreased after 4 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, these series demonstrated the excellent efficacy of metformin on induction of ovulation and pregnancy in Asian women with CC-resistant PCOS."

Transvaginal two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound and SonoAVC (Sonography-based Automated Volume Calculation) were both performed in 226 infertile patients with monodominant follicle growth. 2D diameters were separately compared with SonoAVC-generated d(V) and m-d values in different follicle category, i.e. >10 to 14 mm, >14 to 18 mm, >18 to 22 mm and >22 mm. There was moderate degree of consistency between 2D diameter and SonoAVC-generated parameters regardless of follicle size. The mean differences were 0.82 mm between 2D diameter and SonoAVC-generated d(V) value, and 0.22 mm between 2D diameter and SonoAVC-generated m-d value, respectively. The discrepancy of manual and automated measurements tended to increase as follicle size increased. Our study suggested that compared with manual measurement, SonoAVC might underestimate follicle size. The absolute size of a follicle affected the consistency of two techniques."
CD011126,0,24852891,0,Imaging in endometrial cancer.,"The prognosis for women with endometrial cancer is generally good. This is because the disease is often diagnosed at an early treatable stage, as women seek care owing to postmenopausal bleeding. The prognosis is, however, worse for women with high-risk endometrial cancer. These women may benefit from more extensive surgery, including pelvic- and para-aortic lymph-node dissection, whereas such surgery is of no benefit for women with low-risk cancer. It is, therefore, important to correctly identify women with high-risk cancer before surgery. No consensus has been reached on how and when to use imaging to assess local extension of the disease. Nevertheless, evidence shows that imaging will improve the identification of women with high-risk cancer. The primary aim of this review is to present the examination technique, accuracy, imaging findings, benefits, and shortcomings of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of local tumour extension, in women with endometrial cancer. A secondary goal is to discuss the role of positron emission tomography and computed tomography, diagnostic modalities that primarily are used to detect lymph node and distant metastasis."
CD011126,0,16650358,0,Perspectives on the management of the short cervix identified by transvaginal ultrasound during pregnancy: an update for Canadian obstetrical caregivers.,"A shortened cervix is often considered to be equivalent to cervical insufficiency, and a cerclage may be offered as an intervention to prolong pregnancy; however, we may not be differentiating between true cervical insufficiency and intrauterine causes of cervical shortening. A recent meta-analysis found no significant reduction in preterm birth < 35 weeks' gestation in women with cerclage compared with no cerclage in the total population of women studied. However, there was a potentially significant reduction in preterm birth < 35 weeks among women with a singleton pregnancy (relative risk [RR] 0.74; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.57-0.96), with a singleton pregnancy and a previous preterm birth (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40-0.92), and with a singleton pregnancy with a previous mid-trimester loss (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.33-0.99). An increase was found in preterm birth among twin gestations with cerclage placed for a shortened cervix on transvaginal ultrasound (RR 2.15; 95% CI 1.15-4.01). This unexpected finding underscores the possibility of harm with this intervention. This intervention deserves further study. A national registry or database would allow us to identify women who may benefit more significantly from cerclage by collecting data on possible confounding effects such as concomitant intrauterine infection or placental disease."
CD011126,0,18752078,0,Ultrasonographically guided transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy.,"Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy was introduced as an outpatient procedure to examine the tubo-ovarian complex in infertile women. We evaluated ultrasonographically guided transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (UTHL) as a modified technique for pelvic examination in 562 infertile women without overt evidence of pelvic pathology. Access to the abdominal cavity was observed by ultrasound and examination of the pelvic structures was done by hydrolaparoscopy using saline solution. Access was successful in all cases. No perforation of bowel or rectum was detected. Bilateral visualization of the tubo-ovarian complex was successful in 96% of women. Mild asymptomatic peri-ovarian adhesions were detected in 17% of the women, 4.9% had grade I endometriosis. There was unilateral tubal occlusion in 5%, and bilateral in 3.6%. In 13.9% elective operative laparoscopy for tubal obstruction and/or adhesions was recommended. UTHL is a safe outpatient procedure for examination of the tubo-ovarian complex. The use of ultrasound increases the rate of successful access to the pouch of Douglas and minimizes complications."

Therapeutic and diagnostic scrapings from cervix, as well as parallel samples of the operative removal thyroid gland (TG), after staining with hematoxylin and eosin and picrofuchsin by van Gieson were studied morphologically. The different variants of the cervical mucosa reaction from simple hyperplasia in treated group to adenomyosis with stratification of epithelium, and the tendency of sclerosis and atrophy in the group not receiving L-thyroxin were revealed. In all compared cases Spearmen correlation coefficient had high level of relevance (0,00003). We believe that the cervix changes are the consequence of the decrease of sensitivity to estrogen under the low level of T3 and T4 and increase TSH in plasma.

CD011126,0,25710033,0,Three-dimensional modeling of the pelvic floor support systems of subjects with and without pelvic organ prolapse.,"The purpose of this study was to develop three-dimensional finite element models of the whole pelvic support systems of subjects with and without pelvic organ prolapse (POP) that can be used to simulate anterior and posterior wall prolapses. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in one healthy female volunteer (55 years old, para 2) and one patient (56 years old, para 1) with anterior vaginal wall prolapse. Contours of the pelvic structures were traced by a trained gynecologist. Smoothing of the models was conducted and attachments among structures were established. Finite element models of the pelvic support system with anatomic details were established for both the healthy subject and the POP patient. The models include the uterus, vagina with cavity, cardinal and uterosacral ligaments, levator ani muscle, rectum, bladder, perineal body, pelvis, obturator internus, and coccygeal muscle. Major improvements were provided in the modeling of the supporting ligaments and the vagina with high anatomic precision. These anatomically accurate models can be expected to allow study of the mechanism of POP in more realistic physiological conditions. The resulting knowledge may provide theoretical help for clinical prevention and treatment of POP."
CD011126,0,16782637,0,Endosonography in anorectal disease: an overview.,"Anorectal endosonography (AE), which was introduced 20 years ago, derives from the study of urology. It was first used to evaluate rectal tumours and later also to investigate benign disorders of the anal sphincters and pelvic floor. The technique is easy to perform, it has a short learning curve and causes no more discomfort than a routine digital examination. A rotating probe with a 360 degrees radius and a frequency between 5 and 16 MHz is introduced to the rectum and then slowly withdrawn so that the pelvic floor and subsequently the sphincter complex are seen. Recently, it has become possible to reconstruct three-dimensional images. AE has been used for almost every possible disorder in the anal region and has increased our insight into anal pathology. The clinical indications for AE are: 1. Faecal incontinence in patients when surgery is an option. AE can show sphincter defects with excellent precision. There is a perfect correlation with surgical findings. Studies comparing AE with endoanal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown that both methods are equally good for demonstrating defects in the external anal sphincter; the internal anal sphincter is better visualized with AE. After sphincter repair, the effect is directly related to the decrease in the sphincter defect. 2. Perianal fistulae. AE has been shown to be accurate in staging perianal cryptoglandular fistulae and fistulae in Crohn's disease. When there is an external fistula opening, H2O2 can be introduced with a plastic infusion catheter. The tract then becomes visible as a hyperechoic lesion (""white""). It has been shown that this corresponds well with surgical findings. It is equally sensitive as endoanal MRI. Since recurrent cryptoglandular fistulae are complex in 50% and Crohn's fistula in 75%, it is mandatory to perform AE preoperatively in these patients to avoid missed tracts during surgery and subsequent recurrences. 3. Rectal tumors. In low tubulovillous adenomas or malignant polyps considered removable locally, confirming the local resectability (T0 or T1) is mandatory. Although larger rectal and more advanced tumours can be evaluated with AE, MRI is more sensitive in staging nodal involvement. 4. Anal carcinoma for staging. AE has been shown to stage better than the classical TNM classification for both local extension and prognosis. In conclusion, AE images the internal and external anal sphincter with high accuracy. It is easy to perform and is of particular value in the diagnosis of anal incontinence and perianal fistulae. It is excellent in staging anal carcinoma and can also be used in staging rectal carcinoma, especially very low large malignant polyps."
CD011126,0,15293302,0,Value of sonography in the diagnosis of abnormal vaginal bleeding.,"Abnormal vaginal bleeding is one of the most common presenting complaints in women of any age seeking gynecologic health care. Two of the most frequently used diagnostic tests to investigate the cause of the bleeding are endometrial biopsy and transvaginal sonography. The most worrisome cause of abnormal bleeding is endometrial carcinoma, yet benign etiologies are far more prevalent, including fibroids, polyps, and endometrial atrophy. Endometrial biopsy and transvaginal sonography have equal sensitivities for carcinoma, but sonography is far more effective in diagnosing benign disease.

CD011126,0,24914354,0,Two rare gastric hamartomatous inverted polyp cases suggest the pathogenesis of growth.,"Gastric hamartomatous inverted polyps (GHIP) are difficult to diagnose accurately because of inversion into the submucosal layer. GHIP are diagnosed using the pathological characteristics of the tumor, including the fibroblast cells, smooth muscle, nerve components, glandular hyperplasia, and cystic gland dilatation. Although Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis, and Cowden disease are hereditary, it is rare to encounter 2 cases of monostotic and asymptomatic gastric hamartomas. The pathogeneses of hamartomatous inverted polyps and inverted hyperplastic polyps remain controversial because of the paucity of reported cases. There are 3 hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of complete gastric inverted polyps. Based on our experience with 2 successive, rare GHIP cases, we affirm the hypothesis that after a hamartomatous change occurs in the submucosal layer, some of these components are exposed to the gastric mucosa and, consequently, form a hypertrophic lesion. In Case 1, our hypothesis explains why a tiny hypertrophic change was first detected on the top of the submucosal tumor using a detailed narrow band imaging-magnified endoscopy. There was no confirmation that the milky white mucous and calcification structures were exuding directly from the biopsy site like Case 1, and in Case 2 the presence of this mucous was indirectly confirmed during an endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Regarding the pathogenesis of GHIP, a submucosal hamartomatous change may occur prior to the growth of hypertrophic portions. An en bloc resection using ESD is recommended for treatment."

The aim of the work was the estimation of placental calcification between maternal cigarette smoking and non-smoking pregnant women. All women have taken vitamin supplements during time of experiment. The study group consisted of 200 pregnant women (100 smokers and 100 non-smokers). All patients were admitted and delivered singleton births in the Gynecological and Obstetric Clinical Hospital in Poznan, between 2004-2007. A questionnaire was used as a study tool. s. The study groups were similar under age, education, obstetrical interview and cigarette smoking (5-10 cigarettes/day). Ultrasound investigations showed placental calcification in 36% vs 45% pregnancy at 30 +/- 2 weeks of gestation and in 52% vs 57% at 40 +/- 2 weeks of pregnancy as well as in 55% vs 58% placentas in macroscopic examination, between smoking and non-smoking women. Cigarette smoking should not be considered as exclusive factor leading to formation deposits of calcium in placenta.

We studied CVD risk in young women (18-35 years age) with PCOS using carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and brachial artery flow mediated dilation (FMD) which are markers of subclinical atherosclerosis. Fifty women with PCOS (age: 24.3 ± 4 years; body mass index [BMI]: 24.6 ± 4 kg/m(2)) were compared with 50 age and BMI matched healthy controls (age: 24.6 ± 5 years; BMI: 23.9 ± 4 kg/m(2)). CIMT was significantly higher (0.55 ± 0.09 mm versus 0.40 ± 0.1 mm, p value <0.0001) and FMD was significantly lower (9.39 ± 4.36% versus 13.89 ± 4.77%, p value <0.0001) in cases as compared to controls. These differences in CIMT and FMD remained significant when subgroup were analyzed, obese PCOS versus obese controls and non obese PCOS versus non-obese controls. In stepwise linear regression PCOS was associated with CIMT and FMD independent of age, BMI and blood pressure. Young women with PCOS irrespective of their BMI have evidence for increased CVD risk as shown by increased CIMT and a lower FMD."

This study determined the prevalence of this finding in infertile women and its effect on the outcome of IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This prospective study evaluated 275 consecutive women, commencing IVF/ICSI for the first time. Inclusion criteria were adequate ovarian reserve. Women with fibroids or a previous myomectomy were excluded. All women were screened for adenomyosis by transvaginal ultrasound on three separate occasions. The control group included 256 women and the adenomyosis group included 19 women. There was no significant difference in the ages of women, FSH, cause of infertility, body mass index, total dose of gonadotrophin used and number of oocytes collected between the two groups. However, women with adenomyosis had a higher mean antral follicle count (P=0.006). The clinical pregnancy rate (22.2% versus 47.2%) and ongoing pregnancy rate (11.1% versus 45.9%) were significantly lower in women with adenomyosis and the miscarriage rate (50.0% versus 2.8%) was significantly higher in women with adenomyosis (all P<0.001). Ultrasound evidence of adenomyosis is found in a significant number of women presenting with infertility and has a negative impact on the outcome of IVF/ICSI. This paper suggests that a common condition known as adenomyosis is associated with a reduced success following fertility treatment such as IVF. The diagnosis of adenomyosis has been greatly facilitated by the advent of high-resolution transvaginal ultrasound. This was a study including 275 consecutive women who were commencing IVF for the first time. Comparing women who did not have adenomyosis and those that did, the clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates were both lower in women with adenomyosis (22.2% versus 47.2% and 11.1% versus 45.9%, respectively). So, fewer women with adenomyosis became pregnant and had an ongoing pregnancy. The miscarriage rate was higher in women with adenomyosis compared with those without (50.0% versus 2.8%). We conclude that ultrasound evidence of adenomyosis is found in a significant number of women presenting with infertility and has a negative impact on the outcome of IVF."

CD011126,0,24107779,0,Systems pharmacology of adverse event mitigation by drug combinations.,"Drugs are designed for therapy, but medication-related adverse events are common, and risk/benefit analysis is critical for determining clinical use. Rosiglitazone, an efficacious antidiabetic drug, is associated with increased myocardial infarctions (MIs), thus limiting its usage. Because diabetic patients are often prescribed multiple drugs, we searched for usage of a second drug (""drug B"") in the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) that could mitigate the risk of rosiglitazone (""drug A"")-associated MI. In FAERS, rosiglitazone usage is associated with increased occurrence of MI, but its combination with exenatide significantly reduces rosiglitazone-associated MI. Clinical data from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse support the observations from FAERS. Analysis for confounding factors using logistic regression showed that they were not responsible for the observed effect. Using cell biological networks, we predicted that the mitigating effect of exenatide on rosiglitazone-associated MI could occur through clotting regulation. Data we obtained from the db/db mouse model agreed with the network prediction. To determine whether polypharmacology could generally be a basis for adverse event mitigation, we analyzed the FAERS database for other drug combinations wherein drug B reduced serious adverse events reported with drug A usage such as anaphylactic shock and suicidality. This analysis revealed 19,133 combinations that could be further studied. We conclude that this type of crowdsourced approach of using databases like FAERS can help to identify drugs that could potentially be repurposed for mitigation of serious adverse events."
CD011126,0,24210241,0,[Medical treatments of presumed benign ovarian tumors].,"Medical treatment of functional cysts and endometriomas, and the risk of developing functional ovarian cysts in different therapeutic situations are assessed. The available literature regarding the treatment of functional cysts is limited both by the number of studies and the variability of criteria used to define cysts. There is no evidence to support any efficiency of a medical treatment (LE1). However, oral contraceptive use reduces the risk of development of functional cysts (LE2). Using a second generation combination is recommended as a first-line option in order to reduce thromboembolic risk (LE1). Tamoxifen is significantly associated with an increased risk of developing unilocular cysts before menopause (LE2). For endometriomas, GnRH-agonists are not recommended before cystectomy in order to facilitate surgery (grade C) or to prevent recurrence (grade B). After surgery of endometriomas, the use of an intrauterine device with levonorgestrel or oral contraceptives significantly reduces the volume of the cyst in case of recurrence (LE3); oral contraceptives reduce the recurrence rate of endometriomas (LE2); the use of a low-dose oral contraceptive decreases the frequency and severity of long-term dysmenorrhea (LE1)."

CD011126,0,15301846,0,Gynecologic ultrasound in emergency medicine.,"The true value of ultrasound in acute abdominal pain lies in its ability to detect gynecologic disorders and effectively rule out other causes of acute abdominal pain that require surgical repair. Although the emergent gynecologic indications discussed in this article are few in number, this does not suggest that the nonpregnant patient presenting to the ED with abdominal pain should not receive an ultrasound examination. On the contrary, the author believes that in a ""perfect world,"" ultrasound should be the initial imaging study in most of these patients. The reality is that it is difficult to convince radiology colleagues to call in a sonologist in the middle of the night for any indication other than ovarian torsion when CT scans can diagnose ovarian cysts and tubo-ovarian abscess. As was pointed out in the section on ovarian torsion, even adequate ovarian blood flow does not rule out this diagnosis.Ideally, an ultrasound of the pelvis could be undertaken at the time of the pelvic examination, adding as little as 5 to 10 minutes. If a gynecologic disorder could be confirmed, other imaging studies might be unnecessary,thereby reducing cost (potential savings on laboratory tests, cervical cultures, or CT scans), length of stay, and adverse complications of CT(contrast material reactions, and radiation exposure).Emergency medicine ultrasound continues to grow at a rapid pace. We are working toward a time when most EPs will be competent and comfortable performing bedside ultrasound examinations in a limited number of applications. The gynecologic application of ultrasound,however, requires skill beyond the level of the primary applications of emergency medicine ultrasound-specifically, mastering Doppler ultra-sound. Although ultrasound has proved to be a valuable imaging modality in the nonpregnant patient with acute abdominal pain when performed by a seasoned sonographer, the role of ED ultrasound has been limited to those EPs with significantly more training. The author believes that even limited expertise in gynecologic ultrasound is valuable in helping direct the management of these patients. Further research by skilled EP sonographers eventually will help define the role of EPs in this particular application of ultrasound. EPs should not be discouraged from developing expertise in this examination when a confirmatory study in radiology will be performed. Miles on the ""ultrasound odometer"" will not only sharpen sonographic skills but also will help the EP to better communicate with nonpregnant patients presenting with abdominal pain. There is a fairly specific barometer already in place to gauge one's gynecologic ultrasound skills: a seasoned EP sonographer never skips over the chart of a young woman with right lower quadrant pain."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasound characteristics of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymal tracts after treatment with levofloxacin (a common quinolone antibiotic), in patients with infections caused by Escherichia coli (a Gram-negative bacterium) according to the Naber's classification, which includes the following categories: eradication, eradication with superinfection, persistence and persistence with superinfection. The study was conducted in 100 patients aged 25±8 years (range: 20-40 years) with bacterial MAGI and bacterial cultures positive only for E. coli (colony forming units ≥10(6) per ml). Retrospective analysis was conducted only on patients treated with oral levofloxacin (500 mg) administered once daily for 28 days who were recruited over the last 5 years. Following antibiotic treatment, patients with microbiological persistence or persistence with superinfection had a significantly higher percentage of ultrasound abnormalities suggestive of prostato-vesiculitis (PV) (30.2% and 36.0%, respectively) or prostato-vesiculo-epididymitis (PVE) (60.2% and 70.0%, respectively) compared with patients with microbiological eradication (PV=10.2% and PVE=8.2%, respectively) or eradication with superinfection (PV=18.8% and PVE=21.2%, respectively).

CD011126,0,17578337,0,Treatment monitoring and thermometry for therapeutic focused ultrasound.,"Therapeutic ultrasound is currently enjoying increasingly widespread clinical use especially for the treatment of cancer of the prostate, liver, kidney, breast, pancreas and bone, as well as for the treatment of uterine fibroids. The optimum method of treatment delivery varies between anatomical sites, but in all cases monitoring of the treatment is crucial if extensive clinical acceptance is to be achieved. Monitoring not only provides the operating clinician with information relating to the effectiveness of treatment, but can also provide an early alert to the onset of adverse effects in normal tissue. This paper reviews invasive and non-invasive monitoring methods that have been applied to assess the extent of treatment during the delivery of therapeutic ultrasound in the laboratory and clinic (follow-up after treatment is not reviewed in detail). The monitoring of temperature and, importantly, the way in which this measurement can be used to estimate the delivered thermal dose, is dealt with as a separate special case. Already therapeutic ultrasound has reached a stage of development where it is possible to attempt real-time feedback during exposure in order to optimize each and every delivery of ultrasound energy. To date, data from MR imaging have shown better agreement with the size of regions of damage than those from diagnostic ultrasound, but novel ultrasonic techniques may redress this balance. Whilst MR currently offers the best method for non-invasive temperature measurement, the ultrasound techniques under development, which could potentially offer more rapid visualisation of results, are discussed."

On the other hand, no indication that treatment with CC is safe without US monitoring was identified. The small number of relevant studies and the heterogeneity observed in the methodologies of each study prohibit reliable conclusions to be drawn.

CD011126,0,15322611,0,Urethral polyp verumontanum.,"Congenital posterior urethral polyps are rare benign lesions that can cause a variety of symptoms in young boys, the diagnosis is usually made by cystourethrogram and ultrasonography where the polyp appears as a soft tissue mass arising at the base of the urinary bladder. We present a case of verumontanum polyp in a 7-year-old boy who presented to us in October 2001 with terminal hematuria, dysuria, interrupted stream and suprapubic pain. The polyp was diagnosed by ultrasonography and cystourethrogram. Transurethral resection of the polyp was performed and pathological assessment revealed a fibroepithelial lesion which is consistent with congenital posterior urethral polyp. After 18 months follow up, the patient was free of symptoms. We reviewed the literature to identify the presentation, diagnosis, treatment options and prognosis of these polyps. In the past 20 years the posterior urethral polyp has become more common than before, and it should be considered in boys with lower urinary tract dysfunction and hematuria."

A 12 year-old-girl was found to have a 5-mm gallbladder polyp during an ultrasound examination for nonspecific abdominal pain. Investigation showed no other biliary tract abnormality. During the next 5 years, she was reviewed periodically with ultrasound scans and underwent cholecystectomy when the diameter of the polyp increased to 1 cm. Histology results showed a benign cholesterol polyp. A 12-year-old-boy was found to have an incidental gallbladder polyp, which 2 years later remained static in size for 10 months. The polyp had disappeared spontaneously. The authors suggest that PLGs in children may be either primary or secondary. Only 11 primary PLGs have been reported, and their histology is variable (adenoma, gastric heterotopia, and epithelial hyperplasia). Secondary PLGs may be found in association with metachromatic leukodystrophy, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, or pancreato-biliary malunion. The pathologic spectrum of PLGs in children appears to be different from that in adults. For primary PLGs, cholecystectomy is advisable if there are biliary symptoms or if the polyp is > or =1 cm in size. Asymptomatic cases should be maintained under ultrasound surveillance."

The study involved 78 infertile females with PCOS who were randomly divided into experimental (n=38) and control (n=40) groups. The subjects in the experimental group were treated with letrozole in combination with aspirin and Tiao Jing Cu Yun pills, and the control group was treated with letrozole alone. Transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the endometrial thickness, pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), peak systolic velocity and end diastolic velocity (EDV) of the follicular peripheral artery on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration. The patients who failed to become pregnant in the control group were reintegrated into the experimental group in the subsequent cycle and the clinical effect was observed. In the experimental group, subject perifollicular blood flow was more plentiful, and the PI and RI of the perifollicular blood flow were significantly reduced, while the EDV of the perifollicular blood flow and the rate of clinical pregnancy were markedly elevated compared with the subjects in the control group.

CD011126,0,16524091,0,Hybrid segmentation of colon filled with air and opacified fluid for CT colonography.,"Reliable segmentation of the colon is a requirement for three-dimensional visualization programs and automatic detection of polyps on computed tomography (CT) colonography. There is an evolving clinical consensus that giving patients positive oral contrast to tag out remnants of stool and residual fluids is mandatory. The presence of positive oral contrast in the colon adds an additional challenge for colonic segmentation but ultimately is beneficial to the patient because the enhanced fluid helps reveal polyps in otherwise hidden areas. Therefore, we developed a new segmentation procedure which can handle both air- and fluid-filled parts of the colon. The procedure organizes individual air- and fluid-filled regions into a graph that enables identification and removal of undesired leakage outside the colon. In addition, the procedure provides a risk assessment of possible leakage to assist the user prior to the tedious task of visual verification. The proposed hybrid algorithm uses modified region growing, fuzzy connectedness and level set segmentation. We tested our algorithm on 160 CT colonography scans containing 183 known polyps. All 183 polyps were in segmented regions. In addition, visual inspection of 24 CT colonography scans demonstrated good performance of our procedure: the reconstructed colonic wall appeared smooth even at the interface between air and fluid and there were no leaked regions."

CD011126,0,16447081,0,Early ovarian cancer: 3-D power Doppler.,"Transvaginal sonography plays an important role in the assessment of the morphology of ovarian lesions. However, the accuracy of the technique is limited due to the significant number of false-positive results. Color Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler spectral analysis enable evaluation of ovarian tumor blood flow, analysis of the distribution of blood vessels, and quantitative measurement of blood flow velocity waveforms. These parameters increase the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound evaluation of ovarian tumors. Unfortunately, there is no consensus as to which Doppler parameters and cutoff values are the most predictive of malignancy. Three-dimensional (3-D) power Doppler ultrasound provides a new tool to evaluate features of tumor vascularity. Three-dimensional ultrasound and 3-D power Doppler imaging in patients with ""positive"" findings on standard ultrasound tests, which encompass annual gray-scale transvaginal sonography followed by transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound in selected cases, represent a novel approach for early and accurate detection of ovarian cancer through screening. Combined evaluations of morphology and neovascularity by 3-D power Doppler ultrasound may improve early detection of ovarian carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced 3-D power Doppler sonography facilitates visualization of adnexal tumor vessels, which may aid in differentiating benign from malignant adnexal lesions."

Hyperplasia of the ectopic adrenal tissue in testes is associated with high levels of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in blood serum. The development of non-invasive methods of diagnostic imaging allows detection of testicular lesions in adolescents and children.

CD011126,0,16155722,0,Diagnosis of endometriosis with imaging: a review.,"Endometriosis corresponds to ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. Clinical symptoms include dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, infertility, painful defecation or cyclic urinary symptoms. Pelvic ultrasound is the primary imaging modality to identify and differentiate locations to the ovary (endometriomas) and the bladder wall. Characteristic sonographic features of endometriomas are diffuse low-level internal echos, multilocularity and hyperchoic foci in the wall. Differential diagnoses include corpus luteum, teratoma, cystadenoma, fibroma, tubo-ovarian abscess and carcinoma. Repeated ultrasound is highly recommended for unilocular cysts with low-level internal echoes to differentiate functional corpus luteum from endometriomas. Posterior locations of endometriosis include utero-sacral ligaments, torus uterinus, vagina and recto-sigmoid. Sonographic and MRI features are discussed for each location. Although ultrasound is able to diagnose most locations, its limited sensitivity for posterior lesions does not allow management decision in all patients. MRI has shown high accuracies for both anterior and posterior endometriosis and enables complete lesion mapping before surgery. Posterior locations demonstrate abnormal T2-hypointense, nodules with occasional T1-hyperintense spots and are easier to identify when peristaltic inhibitors and intravenous contrast media are used. Anterior locations benefit from the possibility of MRI urography sequences within the same examination. Rare locations and possible transformation into malignancy are discussed."

We surgically dissected fresh female cadavers maintained in precise surgical anatomic positions and examined the anatomical structures using experimental fine cell detector multislice computed tomography (FDCT) with a slice thickness of 0.3125 mm. In addition, we established a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction model for precise observation of the surgical anatomy using Materialise's Interactive Medical Image Control System (Mimics). We evaluated two-dimensional (2D) images of the surgical anatomical structures in combination with the 3D reconstruction model. The 3D model was reconstructed from 430 serial axial pelvic CT images of a cadaver. The cardinal ligament, uterosacral ligament, paravesical space, and pararectal space were visualized on the CT images obtained from the surgically dissected part. The parametrium components were clearly distinguished on the surgically dissected side. Based on the information from the dissected side, these components on the undissected side could be distinguished as well. We recognized the parametrium components in the area extirpated during radical hysterectomy. The approach using cadavers, experimental FDCT, and 3D software provided excellent visualization of pelvic structures. High-quality images of surgical anatomical structures provide new insight regarding precise surgical anatomy in the female pelvis.

We investigated 24 prepubertal girls with severe PH who were divided into 2 groups: secondary pituitary hyperplasia (group A, n=18), without pituitary hyperplasia (group B, n=6). Serum levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyrotropin (TSH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and prolactin (PRL), pituitary height, uterine volume (UV), ovarian volume (OV), follicular diameter (FD), and follicular number (FN) in group A were measured before and 3-month after levothyroxine therapy. Age-matched healthy prepubertal girls (control group, n=30) were also enrolled in the study. The levels of FT3 and FT4 were significantly lower and the values of TSH, FSH, E2, PRL, pituitary height, UV, OV, and FD were significantly higher in group A than in the control group (all p<0.05). In group B, FT4 levels were significantly lower and TSH levels were significantly higher than in the control group (both p<0.05); the values of FSH, E2, PRL, UV, OV, and FD tended to be higher than those in the control group; there were no statistically significant differences (all p>0.05).

Gestational sacs (GS) were located 21-24 days after transfer (gestational age=5 weeks) by two-dimensional and three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound. The uterine cavity was divided into three parts: upper, middle and lower. Furthermore, the upper region was subdivided into right, middle and left areas, and the middle region was subdivided into right and left areas. The frequency of gestational sacs in each area was evaluated. In singleton pregnancies 66.0% (31/47) of the GS were detected in the upper region, 29.8% (14/47) in the middle region and 4.2% (2/47) in the lower region. In multiple pregnancies (twins and triplet) 45.5% (15/33) of the GS were detected in the upper region, 51.5% (17/33) in the middle region and 3.0% (1/33) in the lower region. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that when embryos are transferred to the central area of the uterine cavity there is an increase in implantation rate in the middle region compared with the rate expected in naturally conceived pregnancies (9-15%)."

CD011126,0,21521928,0,The prevalence of testicular adrenal rest tumors and associated factors in postpubertal patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency.,"Development of a testicular adrenal rest tumor (TART) is common in males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and it can be an important cause of infertility. In the present study, we observed the prevalence of TARTs, and analyzed its associated factors in patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Testicular ultrasonography was performed in 48 postpubertal male patients aged 10.6 to 27.1 years. To determine whether patients were undertreated, we analyzed the serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels to the time of ultrasonographic measurement and calculated the percentage of measurements when serum 17-OHP level was >10 ng/mL relative to the total number of measurements during the follow-up period. We divided the 6-year period before ultrasonographic measurement (time 0) into three 2-year intervals and calculated the average concentration of serum 17-OHP in each interval to give a -2(nd) to 0 year-average concentration (-2-0YAC), -4-2YAC and -6-4YAC. A TART was detected by ultrasonography in 31 of 48 patients (64.6%) and the median maximal cross-sectional area of the TARTs was 0.71 (0.03, 4.95) cm(2). The corrected final adult height was lower, and -4-2YAC and body mass index were higher in patients with TART than in those without. After controlling for the type of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, hydrocortisone-equivalent dose, age, and -6-4YAC, the size of TART was associated with a high undertreatment percentage with a marginal statistical significance. These results suggest that strict disease control is mandatory and regular examination with testicular ultrasonography is recommended in male patients, regardless of the type of 21-hydroxylase deficiency."

Manual screening of ThinPrep slides has been widely practiced for more than 10 years and the recent introduction of the ThinPrep Imaging System (TPI) has been reported as being more sensitive than the conventional smear (CS) in the identification of high-grade cervical disease.We report our experience with ThinPrep Imaging since its introduction into our routine gynecological cytology service. 87,284 split sample pairs reported using the Imaging System demonstrated a decrease in unsatisfactory reports (3.65% for CS and 0.87% for TPI) and an increase in possible high grade and definite high-grade squamous reports (1.57% for CS and 1.62% for TPI).For 1,083 biopsy confirmed high-grade lesions, the correct diagnosis of high grade or possible high-grade squamous disease was made on the ThinPrep imaged slide in 61.0% (661/1,083) of cases and on the CS in 59.4% (643/1,083). This was not statistically significant. When all abnormalities identified on cytology were considered, including possible low grade and definite low-grade abnormalities, the difference in sensitivity for Thinprep imaged slides of 96.0% (1,040/1,083) and CSs of 91.6% (992/1,083) was statistically significant."

CD011126,0,16609646,0,[Management of adult abdominal pain in the Emergency Room].,"Abdominal pain is a commonplace reason for surgical consultation in the emergency department and is the the most common symptom which the digestive surgeon on-call must evaluate. He must understand the pathophysiologic basis of visceral pain and referred pain in order to appreciate its diverse manifestations. Abdominal pain can stem from many causes intestinal and non-intestinal, medical and surgical. Evaluation and management in the emergency department must be rapid and pragmatic; clinical history and physical examination should define the gravity of the case, direct the first diagnostic procedures and complementary examinations, and guide the therapeutic direction. Ultrasonography is a quick and effective diagnostic procedure in the diagnosis of biliary, urologic, and gynecologic pathologies; it can be useful for other digestive problems as well. The new generation spiral CT scanner gives excellent definition of digestive and vascular pathologies. The initial evaluation and management of the acute abdomen may determine the prognosis of the patient; it should lead to prompt symptomatic relief and to a well-directed treatment appropriate to the diagnosis."

CD011126,0,23216258,0,Small intestinal submucosa segments as matrix for tissue engineering: review.,"Tissue engineering (TE) is an emerging interdisciplinary field aiming at the restoration or improvement of impaired tissue function. A combination of cells, scaffold materials, engineering methods, and biochemical and physiological factors is employed to generate the desired tissue substitute. Scaffolds often play a pivotal role in the engineering process supporting a three-dimensional tissue formation. The ideal scaffold should mimic the native extracellular environment providing mechanical and biological properties to allow cell attachment, migration, and differentiation, as well as remodeling by the host organism. The scaffold should be nonimmunogenic and should ideally be resorbed by the host over time, leaving behind only the regenerated tissue. More than 40 years ago, a preparation of the small intestine was introduced for the replacement of vascular structures. Since then the small intestinal submucosa (SIS) has gained a lot of interest in TE and subsequent clinical applications, as this material exhibits key features of a highly supportive scaffold. This review will focus on the general properties of the SIS and its applications in therapeutical approaches as well as in generating tissue substitutes in vitro. Furthermore, the main problem of TE, which is the insufficient nourishment of cells within three-dimensional, artificial tissues exceeding certain dimensions is addressed. To solve this issue the implementation of another small intestine-derived preparation, the biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM), could be a feasible option. The BioVaM comprises in addition to SIS the arterial and venous mesenteric pedicles and exhibits thereby a perfusable vessel bed that is preserved after decellularization."
CD011126,0,18755508,0,Cancer risk in male factor-infertility.,"Severe forms of male-factor infertility are associated with an increased risk of testicular cancer and scrotal ultrasonography is widely used for diagnosis. In this study, 2172 male members of infertile couples referred to our Reproductive Medicine Unit were submitted to scrotal ultrasonography and 835 selected patients had been followed during a 2-year period. Eight out of nine neoplastic nodules found at the initial examination were unpalpable and discovered by ultrasonography. Ten tumoral lesions were found in 370 testicular biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes or to extract spermatozoa; and eight additional neoplastic lesions were discovered during the 2-year follow-up of 835 patients. The cumulative rate of neoplastic disease was 3.2%. Thirteen cases (1.5%) were malignant (12 germ cell tumours and one non-Hodgkin lymphoma of testicular origin); the remaining 14 were benign forms (Leydig cell tumours and hyperplasias, Sertoli cell nodules, adenomatoid tumours). Testicular volume (cut-off: 12ml) resulted weakly correlated with germ cell cancer (p=n.s., odds ratio 2.01) while low total sperm count (<40x10(6)) (p=0.002, odds ratio 8.4), previous cryptorchidism (p=0.04, odds ratio 7.5) and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism (p=0.04, odds ratio 7.9) were associated with an increased risk. But a stronger correlation with germ cell cancer was found in the patients with some utrasonographic anomalies, i.e. testicular microlithiasis (p=0.0015, odds ratio 37.1) or larger calcifications not fitting the description of testicular microlithiasis (p<0.0001, odds ratio 69.5). Our findings indicate that scrotum ultrasonography should always be advised in subfertile men with <40x10(6) spermatozoa/ejaculate or hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism or previous cryptorchidism, and that particular care should be taken in the presence of testicular microlithiasis or testicular calcifications. These men should be aware of the existence of higher risk of testicular cancer and trained in testicular self-examination."
CD011126,0,18351357,0,CT colonography with reduced bowel preparation after incomplete colonoscopy in the elderly.,"We prospectively assessed the feasibility and acceptance of computerized tomographic colonography (CTC) without bowel cathartic preparation in elderly patients after incomplete colonoscopy. A total of 136 patients underwent CTC without cathartic preparation. The time delay between conventional colonoscopy and CTC ranged between 3 and 20 days, depending on the clinical situation. Before CTC, fecal tagging was achieved by adding diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium to regular meals. CTCs were interpreted using a primary two-dimensional (2D) approach and 3D images for further characterization. Patients were interviewed before and 2 weeks after CTC to assess preparation acceptance. CTC was feasible and technically successful in all the 136 patients. Fecal tagging was judged as excellent in 113 (83%) patients and sufficient in 23 (17%). Average CT image interpretation time was 14.8 min. Six (4.4%) cases of colorectal cancer and nine (6.6%) large polyps were detected, as well as 23 (11.3%) extracolonic findings of high clinical importance. No major side effect occurred, although 25% patients reported minor side effects, especially diarrhea. Overall, 76/98 patients replied that they would be willing to repeat the test if necessary. CTC without cathartic preparation is a technically feasible and safe procedure to complete a colonic study in the elderly, prompting its use in clinical practice."

CD011126,0,17049902,0,[Contribution of three dimensional imaging techniques in the visualization of the fetal uterus].,"The prenatal diagnosis of ambiguous genitalia requires a complete examination of the fetal anatomy to rule out any other congenital defects and the analysis of the fetal genotype. In addition any additional information on the anatomy of the internal genitalia, i.e. the presence or absence of fetal uterus, may be relevant to the prenatal evaluation of female pseudo-hermaphroditism. The recent development of 3D and 4D ultrasound technology may be relevant to a more clearly identification of the fetal uterus. Volume contrast imaging (VCI) provides high contrast images by the realization of thick slices of the region of interest (ROI) thereby providing a clearer picture of the fetal uterus. The multiplanar mode may also facilitate the differentiation of the fetal uterus from the other intra-pelvic organs by offering images in three perpendicular planes.

CD011126,0,23419796,0,How to recognize PCOS: results of a web-based survey at IVF-worldwide.com.,"This retrospective evaluation of a web-based survey posted from 1 to 30 September 2010 was to determine which diagnostic tools physicians are currently utilizing to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Responses from 262 IVF centres in 68 countries are included in the study. Providers used various diagnostic criteria to diagnose PCOS, including the Rotterdam criteria (82%), National Institutes of Health criteria (8%), Androgen Excess Society 2006 criteria (3%) and other classification systems (7%). Many providers utilized diagnostic tools not necessarily included in traditional classification systems: 58% of respondents evaluated LH/FSH ratio in addition to androgen concentrations to define patients with PCOS; physicians also commonly obtain measurement of anti-Müllerian hormone (22%) and impaired glucose tolerance (74%) in diagnosing PCOS. Many respondents (64%) felt that polycystic-appearing ovaries on ultrasound with anovulation and a normal serum prolactin should be adequate criteria to diagnose PCOS. In conclusion, while the majority of centres (82%) uses the Rotterdam criteria to diagnose PCOS, other criteria and diagnostic tools are commonly used in evaluating patients with suspected PCOS. This study highlights the need for continual re-evaluation of PCOS diagnostic criteria with an ultimate goal of developing a consensus definition for the disorder in the future."
CD011126,0,23011079,0,Computerized detection and recognition of follicles in ovarian ultrasound images: a review.,"Observing changes in females' ovaries is essential in obstetrics and gynaecological imaging, e.g., genetic engineering and human reproduction. It is particularly important to monitor the dynamics of ovarian follicles' growth, as only fully mature and grown follicles, i.e., the dominant follicles have a potential to ovulate at the end of a follicular phase. Gynaecologists follow this process in two dimensions, but recently three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound examinations are coming to the fore. This paper surveys the existing computer methods for detection, recognition, and analyses of follicles in two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D ovarian ultrasound recordings. Our study focuses on the efficiency, validation, and assessment of proposed follicle processing algorithms. The most important processing steps were identified in order to compare their performances. Higher ranking solutions are suggested for the so-called best algorithm for 2-D and 3-D ultrasound recordings of ovarian follicles. Finally, some guidelines for future research in this field are discussed, in particular for 3-D ultrasound volumes."

CD011126,0,15346077,0,New indications for computer-assisted surgery: tumor resection in the pelvis.,The resection of recurrent malignant pelvic tumors was supported by a commercially available navigation system in three patients. Preoperatively three-dimensional images from the pelvis were obtained by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to identify the tumor extension. During surgery navigated tools oriented the surgeon to excise the tumor with adequate virtual margins. Navigation was helpful for tumor identification in one patient with a recurrent presacral mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. In the other two patients the tumor resection in the bone was done with three-dimensional observation of the osteotomies in the sacrum. In all three patients the histopathologic analysis confirmed that the neoplasms were excised accurately within their margins. We think that computer-assisted surgery is a potential method to increase the accuracy of tumor resections.
CD011126,0,15906788,0,Incidental discovery of ano-rectal disease during transrectal ultrasound performed for prostatic disease.,"Transrectal ultrasound (US) has long been a routine investigation for the study of various diseases of the prostate. The use of 360 degrees transverse scanning probes and recently, of 3D probes, has been proposed as a suitable means of studying the rectal wall. Between January 1997 and February 2004, 3758 subjects suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms associated with micturition disturbances underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) with a multiplane probe having a variable frequency ranging up to 7.5 MHz and, in the later period, with a transrectal 3D volumetric probe. In 489 patients (13%) TRUS yielded suspicious images of the rectal wall. This finding was verified by a proctologic and rectoscopic examination. In 132 cases (27%) it was shown to be a false positive, mainly due to imperfect cleansing of the anal canal; in 284 cases (58%) benign disease was demonstrated (hemorrhoids in 192 patients, abscesses in 21, perianal fistulas in 18, inflamed lymph nodes in 27, polyps in 16). In 34 patients (7%) a malignant tumor was found (infiltration of the anterior rectal wall by a prostatic adenocarcinoma in 13, and a primitive adenocarcinoma of rectal origin in the remaining 21). It can be concluded that transrectal US does not permit a certain diagnosis of the nature of rectal disease, but does raise a diagnostic suspicion that can orient the surgeon to schedule more invasive diagnostic investigations."

CD011126,0,25366470,0,Malignant mixed germ cell tumour of ovary--an unusual combination and review of literature.,"Mixed germ cell tumours of the ovary are malignant neoplasms of the ovary comprising of two or more types of germ cell components. Most of the malignant mixed germ cell tumours consists of dysgerminoma accompanied by endodermal sinus tumours, immature teratoma or choriocarcinoma. There are only few case reports of mixed germ cell tumours with different combinations of malignant components. We report a very rare case of mixed germ cell tumours consisted of malignant components of endodermal sinus tumour, emryonal carcinoma, and benign component of teratomatuos and trophoblastic differentiation. This is the first case report in the literature with both benign and malignant component of type described to best of our knowledge. Patient was an 18 year old girl, who presented with pain abdomen, abdominal mass and irregular bleeding. Ultrasound and CT scan showed a huge mass with solid and cystic component. Tumour markers i.e alpha feto- protein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), lactate dehydrogenate (LDH) and Ca-125 were raised. We performed fertility sparing surgery by preserving one ovary, tube and uterus. Conclusion: Malingnant mixed germ cell tumours of ovary are highly aggressive neoplasm and early intervention and fertility sparing surgery is required for any adolescent girl presenting with rapidly enlarging pelvic mass."
CD011126,0,22352649,0,Visualization of high-throughput and label-free antibody-polypeptide binding for drug screening based on microarrays and surface plasmon resonance imaging.,"This work presents a visualization method for the high-throughput monitoring of antibody-polypeptide binding by integrating a microarray chip with surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). A prism-coupled SPRi system with smart images processing software and a 5 × 5 polypeptide microarray was developed. The modeling analysis was performed to optimize the system and the materials of prism and chip, looking for the optimal incident wavelength and angle of incidence for dynamic SPRi detection in solution. The system can dynamically monitor 25 tunnels of biomolecule interactions in solution without secondary tag reactants. In addition, this system can determine the specific profile of antibody-polypeptide binding in each tunnel and yield a visual three-dimensional histogram of dynamic combinations in all microarray tunnels. Furthermore, the detection limit of the label-free antibody-polypeptide binding reached 1 pg/μL in a one-step binding test, and an ultrasensitive detection of 10 fg/μL was obtained using three-step cascade binding. Using the peptide microarray, the amount of sample and reagents used was reduced to 80 nL per tunnel, and 20 × 20 tunnels of biomolecule interactions could be analyzed in parallel in a 7 mm × 7 mm microreaction cells. This device and method offer a potential platform for high-throughput and label-free dynamic monitoring multiple biomolecule interactions for drug discovery and basic biomedical research."
CD011126,0,17673837,0,Fundamental elements for successful performance of CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy).,"There are many factors affecting the successful performance of CT colonography (CTC). Adequate colonic cleansing and distention, the optimal CT technique and interpretation with using the newest CTC software by a trained reader will help ensure high accuracy for lesion detection. Fecal and fluid tagging may improve the diagnostic accuracy and allow for reduced bowel preparation. Automated carbon dioxide insufflation is more efficient and may be safer for colonic distention as compared to manual room air insufflation. CT scanning should use thin collimation of < or =3 mm with a reconstruction interval of < or =1.5 mm and a low radiation dose. There is not any one correct method for the interpretation of CTC; therefore, readers should be well-versed with both the primary 3D and 2D reviews. Polyps detected at CTC should be measured accurately and reported following the ""polyp size-based"" patient management system. The time-intensive nature of CTC and the limited resources for training radiologists appear to be the major barriers for implementing CTC in Korea."

Women were offered DNA analysis followed by either annual screening or prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). Study population consisted of 512 high-risk women (median follow-up 2.07 years, range 0-9.4 years): 265 women (52%) had a BRCA mutation. Persisting abnormalities indicated diagnostic surgery in 24 women resulting in one primary ovarian cancer FIGO stage IIIc was found. The effectiveness of screening was studied by calculating the probability of finding ovarian cancers in the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 carrier group and comparing this to the identified number of ovarian cancers. The number of ovarian cancer patients found at surveillance was in accordance with the predicted number of ovarian cancers. A total number of 169 women underwent prophylactic BSO: one ovarian cancer stage IIb was found. In conclusion, the surveillance programme for hereditary ovarian cancer does identify patients with ovarian cancer but is very inefficient considering the high number of surveillance visits and the advanced stage of ovarian cancer in the identified patient. For prevention of advanced stage ovarian cancer, prophylactic BSO from age 35-40 years is a more efficient alternative."

No other imaging technique has a role in the triage of these women. In women with postmenopausal bleeding, ultrasound is used to categorise women as at low or high risk of endometrial cancer, and the result of the ultrasound examination is the basis for further management. In women with abnormal vaginal bleeding before the menopause, the role of ultrasound is less clear. This is because some common causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding before the menopause cannot be diagnosed with ultrasound, such as infection, dysfunctional bleeding, or problems with intrauterine contraceptive devices or contraceptive pills. Nonetheless, transvaginal ultrasound may also sometimes be helpful in women with abnormal vaginal bleeding before the menopause. In this chapter, I present ultrasound findings in women with endometrial cancer, endometrial polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, adenomyosis, uterine myomas, including submucous myomas and leiomyosarcoma, and describe ultrasound-based triage of women with postmenopausal bleeding."

Screening strategies for ovarian cancer have centered on the serum tumor marker CA 125, transvaginal sonography (TVS), or sequential use of the two modalities. A single determination of CA 125 is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific to be used as an initial stage in screening. Specificity can be improved by monitoring CA 125 over time with an algorithm that estimates risk of ovarian cancer. Sensitivity of CA125 can be improved by use of multiple markers in combination. Gene expression array analysis, proteomics and lipomics are being utilized to identify markers that can be used in combination with CA 125 to detect >95% of early stage ovarian cancers. To maintain high specificity, values for different markers are being combined using novel approaches of neural network analysis and mixed multivariate analysis. Sequential use of multiple markers and TVS could provide a cost-effective strategy to detect a disease of intermediate prevalence."

However, despite the improvements that have been made in this method, sensitivity is low, and although it is simple, it is too rarely used. CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) is proposed in case of failure, additional risk factors or refusal of optical colonoscopy in high-risk patients or in the presence of a positive FOBT. It should also be proposed as an alternative to the FOBT test to patients who accept the constraints of this technique."
CD011126,0,19256783,0,CT colonography - towards applications for colorectal cancer screening.,"Three-dimensional (3D) imaging of the large intestine is globally called computed tomography colonography (CTC). CTC has been intensively investigated for application in colorectal cancer screening in Western countries and with the advent of multi-slice CT (MSCT), which provides effective high resolution in 3D CT images, the diagnostic use of CT for colorectal lesions has become a concept widely accepted throughout the world. Computer-aided detection (CAD) for colorectal polyps using digital CT image data and digital pre-processing are also advancing in the West. Compared with colonoscopy, which depends largely on the skill of the performer, CTC produces objective and reproducible diagnostic images and presents a high probability of standardizing examination protocols. Development of effective systems for screening colorectal lesions is expected, leveraging the excellent processing capability of MSCT to enhance 3D visualization and allow efficient detection."

Objective of the study is to analyze biomarker concentrations included in the two novel ovarian tumor differential diagnostic tests (risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm and OVA1) approved by food and drug administration in patients with ovarian tumors and to establish a new ovarian cancer risk assessment algorithm in conjunction with ultrasound score and menopausal status. Ovarian cancer diagnostic tests, developed in the training setting, were evaluated in the independent validation settings of Asian Pacific ovarian cancer biomarker research group study population and Denmark Pelvic Mass project population. Results show that mean serum concentrations of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4), and beta-2-microglobulin were upregulated, but apolipoprotein A1, transferrin, and transthyretin were downregulated among ovarian cancer patients. When only one biomarker was introduced in the logistic regression analysis, together with ultrasonographic score and menopausal status, HE4 (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.930; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.891-0.969) was more accurate than CA125 (AUC = 0.902; 95 % CI 0.855-0.949) in ovarian cancer diagnostic, but when both biomarkers were included in the logistic regression analyses, ovarian cancer diagnostic accuracy was increased (AUC = 0.939; 95 % CI 0.902-0.977). In conclusions, human epididymis secretory protein 4 and CA125 in combination with ultrasonographic features and menopausal status has high accuracy in ovarian tumor differentiation."

CD011126,0,17374862,0,Pitfalls in multi-detector row CT colonography: a systematic approach.,"Thin-section multi-detector row computed tomographic (CT) colonography is a powerful tool for the detection and classification of colonic lesions. However, each step in the process of a CT colonographic examination carries the potential for misdiagnosis. Suboptimal patient preparation, CT scanning protocol deficiencies, and perception and interpretation errors can lead to false-positive and false-negative findings, adversely affecting the diagnostic performance of CT colonography. These problems and pitfalls can be overcome with a variety of useful techniques and observations. A relatively clean, dry, and well-distended colon can be achieved with careful patient preparation, thereby avoiding the problem of residual stool and fluid. Knowledge of the morphologic and attenuation characteristics of common colonic lesions and artifacts can help identify bulbous haustral folds, impacted diverticula, an inverted appendiceal stump, or mobile polyps, any of which may pose problems for the radiologist. A combined two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging approach is recommended for each colonic finding. A thorough knowledge of the various pitfalls and pseudolesions that may be encountered at CT colonography, along with use of dedicated problem-solving techniques, will help the radiologist differentiate between definite colonic lesions and pseudolesions."

CD011126,0,24246880,0,Diagnostic imaging modalities for Müllerian anomalies: the case for a new gold standard.,"Female reproductive tract anomalies are difficult to number in the general population but are often discovered in evaluations of menstrual complications or fertility disorders. Traditionally, assessment of the reproductive tract entailed hysterosalpingography to image the uterine cavity with the final diagnosis provided by combined hysteroscopy/laparoscopy. These approaches, while providing important information, were uncomfortable and invasive and for HSG, involved radiation exposure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MIR) allowed for the avoidance of these issues while offering accuracy, thus becoming the gold standard diagnostic imaging modality but entailing cost, patient discomfort, and inconvenience. Current advances in ultrasound technology, specifically 3-dimensional ultrasound, achieve the same benefits of MRI in being accurate and noninvasive but also offer the following advantages: they are available in the office, they are cost-effective, and they provide immediate results. As 3-dimensional technology continues to become more accessible and more providers become proficient in using it, ultrasound may replace MRI as the new gold imaging standard in diagnosing müllerian anomalies."

All women had normal ovulatory cycles. The hysteroscopic assessment of secretory-phase endometrium was made by characterizing the glandular openings (GO) and vasculature. The assessments were classified as 'good': characterized by ring-type GO and well-developed vessels; and 'poor': characterized by dot and/or punctate-type GO and fine vasculature. In the 30 patients classified 'good' prior to the IVF cycle, there was a higher pregnancy rate (40%) than in 'poor' ones (13%). Thirty of 50 infertile women were classified 'good', and their average age was lower than that of the remaining 20 in the 'poor' group. Preovulatory estradiol was significantly higher in the 'good' than in the 'poor' group. From an analysis of 20 patients with a 'poor' assessment, it was demonstrated that the maturation of secretory-phase endometrium was affected by a failure of folliculogenesis, progesterone secretion, endometrial growth and menstrual shedding."
CD011126,0,17854077,0,Non-gynecologic cytology on liquid-based preparations: A morphologic review of facts and artifacts.,"Liquid-based preparations (LBP) are increasingly being used both for gynecologic (gyn) and non-gynecologic (non-gyn) cytology including fine needle aspirations (FNA). The two FDA-approved LBP currently in use include ThinPrep (TP), (Cytyc Corp, Marlborough, MA) and SurePath (SP), (TriPath Imaging Inc., Burlington, NC). TP was approved for cervico-vaginal (Pap test) cytology in 1996 and SP in 1999 and both have since also been used for non-gyn cytology. In the LBP, instead of being smeared, cells are rinsed into a liquid preservative collection medium and processed on automated devices. Even after a decade of use, the morphological interpretation of LBP remains a diagnostic challenge because of somewhat altered morphology and artifacts or facts resulting from the fixation and processing techniques. These changes include cleaner background with altered or reduced background and extracellular elements; architectural changes such as smaller cell clusters and sheets, breakage of papillae; altered cell distribution with more dyscohesion and changes in cellular morphology with enhanced nuclear features, smaller cell size and slightly more three-dimensional (3-D) clusters. Herein, we review the published literature on morphological aspects of LBP for non-gyn cytology."

CD011126,0,23086354,0,Getting to the core of platinum drug bio-distributions: the penetration of anti-cancer platinum complexes into spheroid tumour models.,"Elemental mapping and fluorescence imaging techniques are frequently employed to probe the distribution of platinum-based chemotherapeutics within biological systems. Although useful, these techniques have unique limitations: elemental mapping methods, such as those that use particle beams, typically require rigorous sample preparation that can alter chemical distributions, whilst in situ visible fluorescence studies require fluorescent-tagging of the platinum component and may be confounded by factors such as ligand loss. The present study aimed to establish reliable methods for accurately probing the bio-distribution of platinum compounds within the model tumour micro-environment of the well characterised DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell spheroids. 3D X-ray fluorescence computed micro-tomography (XRF-CT) was performed on intact untreated spheroids to determine the effect of physical sectioning and chemical fixation on elemental distributions. It was revealed for the first time that cisplatin can readily penetrate through DLD-1 spheroids and accumulate in the central hypoxic and necrotic regions of the spheroids. Furthermore, formalin fixing was shown to cause significant changes to the distributions and concentrations of the elements, particularly in the cases of platinum and zinc. This effect was not observed in the cryo-fixed and cryo-sectioned samples. X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) was used to re-examine the fate of platinum in the previously reported fluorescence distribution studies of platinum(ii) complexes tagged with fluorescent anthraquinone moieties. In contrast to the fluorescence distributions, in which fluorescence was observed predominantly around the periphery of the spheroids, the XFM revealed a high level of platinum in the spheroid centre, indicating that ligand exchange occurred within the peripheral cell layers. Both the platinum maps and the fluorescence images exhibit similar diffusion trends, supporting the conclusion that charge on the compound can slow cellular uptake can enhance tumour penetration."

CD011126,0,23160866,0,Ovarian tumor characterization and classification using ultrasound-a new online paradigm.,"Among gynecological malignancies, ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of death. Image mining algorithms have been predominantly used to give the physicians a more objective, fast, and accurate second opinion on the initial diagnosis made from medical images. The objective of this work is to develop an adjunct computer-aided diagnostic technique that uses 3D ultrasound images of the ovary to accurately characterize and classify benign and malignant ovarian tumors. In this algorithm, we first extract features based on the textural changes and higher-order spectra information. The significant features are then selected and used to train and evaluate the decision tree (DT) classifier. The proposed technique was validated using 1,000 benign and 1,000 malignant images, obtained from ten patients with benign and ten with malignant disease, respectively. On evaluating the classifier with tenfold stratified cross validation, the DT classifier presented a high accuracy of 97 %, sensitivity of 94.3 %, and specificity of 99.7 %. This high accuracy was achieved because of the use of the novel combination of the four features which adequately quantify the subtle changes and the nonlinearities in the pixel intensity variations. The rules output by the DT classifier are comprehensible to the end-user and, hence, allow the physicians to more confidently accept the results. The preliminary results show that the features are discriminative enough to yield good accuracy. Moreover, the proposed technique is completely automated, accurate, and can be easily written as a software application for use in any computer."
CD011126,0,21614152,0,Study on the characteristics of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and its utility in assessing the microvessel density in ovarian tumors or tumor-like lesions.,"Angiogenesis is a critical factor in tumor growth and metastasis, and microvessel density (MVD) was an important parameter for assessing vessels in tumors. However, radiologic assessment of tumor vascularity is not yet well established. In our study, we aimed at investigating the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in exploring the vascularity of the ovarian tumors or tumor-like lesions to assess the relationship between the parameters of the peak intensity (PI) and area under curve (AUC) on CEUS and MVD in ovarian masses. Compared to the contrast-enhanced ultrasound technique, conventional ultrasound shows limitation in differentiating benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The former is promising in improving the sensitivity of detecting small vessels and blood flow in ovarian tumors. Our results showed clear differences in enhancement patterns between benign and malignant ovary tumors or tumor-like lesions. The PI and AUC in the malignant tumors were significantly higher than those in the benign tumors or tumor-like lesions (p=0.001 and =0.01, respectively). The MVD was 43.1 ± 20.4 in the benign tumors or tumor-like lesions and was 65.3 ± 22.3 in the malignant ones (p= 0.01). In both the benign and malignant groups, the PI and AUC were correlated significantly with the MVD (r=0.595, p = 0.001; r =0.533, p = 0.003, respectively). The PI and AUC in CEUS can reflect the MVD in ovarin tumors. The PI and AUC of the ovarian masses in the contrast transvaginal sonography show significant correlation with the angiogenesis and may help in assessing tumor vascularity in ovarian masses."
CD011126,0,7959343,0,Ovarian tumors: prediction of the probability of malignancy by using patient's age and tumor morphologic features with a logistic model.,"An attempt was made to predict the probability of malignancy of a given ovarian tumor in a certain patient by using the age and simple morphologic features of the tumor. A cohort of 959 patients with ovarian tumors was analysed retrospectively according to the patient's age and tumor characteristics such as greatest diameter, consistency, bilaterality and diagnosis as malignant (271 patients) or benign (688 patients). All variables were entered unconditionally in a logistic regression. The presence of solid/multilocular elements has a 9.6-fold increased risk of malignancy, where a bilateral tumor has a 2.8-fold increase. Significant increase in risk of malignancy was observed in ages under 20 and over 40 years, as well as in tumors with a diameter larger than 9 cm. All variables were highly significant associated with the discrimination between benign and malignant. A formula including all variables has been developed so that the probability of malignancy can be estimated by a scientific calculator. In conclusion, simple, easily determined by ultrasound and reproducible criteria such as patient's age, tumor size, consistency and bilaterality were assembled in a logistic model in order to predict the probability of malignancy for a given ovarian tumor, in an individual patient."

Thirteen female CAH patients (median age 19.8 years, range 14.8-23.5 years) underwent transvaginal (n=6) or transabdominal (n=7) ultrasonography by a gynaecologist and MR imaging (n=13) of the ovaries (pre and post contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted images). Ovarian adrenal rest tumours were defined as small hypoechoic and multifocal nodules on ultrasound and isointense lesions on T1- and hypointense on T2-weighted MR images (derived from characteristics of testicular adrenal rest tumours). Polycystic ovaries were defined as the presence of > or = 10 follicles arranged peripherally around or scattered throughout increased stroma. No ovarian adrenal rest tumours were found either on ultrasound, or by MR imaging. Polycystic ovaries were found in 2 of the 13 patients (15.4%), both with ultrasound and MR. No ovarian adrenal rest tumours were detected in these female CAH patients, which suggests that ovarian adrenal rest tumours in CAH females are rare. The prevalence of polycystic ovaries corresponded to that in the general population. From these results, we would suggest that routine ovarian imaging in CAH females is not indicated. However, when ovarian dysfunction is present, ovarian imaging is advised, first by ultrasonography, to detect ovarian adrenal rest tumours or polycystic ovaries."

CD011126,0,17509199,0,Selective visualization of the Fallopian tube with magnetic resonance imaging.,"At present, X-ray hysterosalpingography is used commonly as a screening method for testing Fallopian tube patency, but the results are often unreliable due to mucous plugs or muscular contractions. Selective catheterization of the tubes under X-ray control is feasible, but is rarely used due to exposure of young individuals aiming for pregnancy to a high ionizing dose. Here, a case is described of a patient whose Fallopian tubes were selectively catheterized and visualized three-dimensionally under contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance using a high-viscous gadoteric acid solution (Dotarem). In this patient, bilateral peritubal adhesions caused a blockage of the fimbrial part of the tube leading to transuterine spilling of tubal fluid. Laparoscopy followed by bilateral salpingectomy was then performed, which confirmed the three-dimensional MRI images, and the excised specimens were examined histologically. The advantages of this novel technique include the avoidance of ionizing damage to the gonads and the potential for development of more elaborate interventional methods, such as ballooning and stenting. It is intended to develop contrast MRI further, both for improved non-invasive visualization and for manipulative technology of the Fallopian tubes."
CD011126,0,22964768,0,Diagnostic ultrasound activates pure prekallikrein.,"Diagnostic ultrasound activates the contact phase of human coagulation. This has been seen in human blood or plasma or with purified factor 12. The present work aimed to quantify a possibly triggering action of ultrasound on purified prekallikrein, the second of the two main triggers of the intrinsic hemostasis cascade. Either 2.7 μg/ml human prekallikrein or for control 1 μg/ml kallikrein in 26% glycerol - 0.54% NaCl-10.6 mmol/l Na3 citrate pH 7.4, in emptied polypropylene coagulation monovettes (Sarstedt) were exposed to diagnostic ultrasound (Siemens Acouson Antares, 5 MHz, 0.6 TIB, 0.6 TIS) for 0-5 min at room temperature (RT). Fifty microliter samples were withdrawn in duplicate and placed into an U-wells high quality microtiter plate (Brand 781600). Then 10 μl 2 mmol/l chromogenic substrate HD-CHG-Ala-Arg-pNA in 0.45% NaCl were added, and the increase in absorbance with time (ΔA405 nm /t at 37°C) was determined by a microtiterplate photometer with a 1 mA resolution (PHOmo; anthos). Exposure to diagnostic ultrasound biphasically increased the chromogenic activity of a prekallikrein solution in 26% glycerol. About 3-4 min ultrasound at 23 °C generated about 0.02 μg/ml kallikrein, that means that about 1% of pure prekallikrein in glycerol was converted into kallikrein. Thus, diagnostic ultrasound activates purified human prekallikrein to kallikrein. The ultrasound energy seems to fold the latent proenzyme prekallikrein into the active enzyme kallikrein. This contributes to explain the triggering action of ultrasound on the contact system of plasmatic human coagulation. Conversion of only 1% of prekallikrein into kallikrein is absolutely sufficient to start the intrinsic coagulation cascade. The clinical consequence of this action of ultrasound on intrinsic coagulation is that patients at risk for thrombosis, for example, patients with insufficiencies of hepatocytes, AT-3, C1-ina, or fibrinolysis should be protected by low-molecular-weight-heparin prior to the exposure of ultrasound, especially upon its prolonged exposure."
CD011126,0,23065161,0,US of the ovary and adnexa: to worry or not to worry?,"Ultrasonography (US) is typically the first study to be requested in patients with clinical findings that may suggest pelvic disease. The evaluation of adnexal masses is a common component of the sonologist's workload, and US has been shown to be accurate for both detecting and characterizing these masses, most of which are either insignificant or benign and therefore require little or no follow-up. Recognition of the most common benign ovarian and extraovarian adnexal masses should help avoid additional or unnecessary imaging. US features that suggest malignancy include thick septations, vascularized solid components, or areas of focal wall thickening, and identifying these features will result in timely management. Indeterminate-appearing masses demonstrate atypical features and cannot easily be classified as definitely either benign or malignant. Proper reporting and management recommendations serve to alleviate both patient anxiety and physician misinterpretation. Knowledge of these recommendations and of the characteristic US features of benign, malignant, and indeterminate adnexal masses can serve as important guidelines for patient management."

CD011126,0,20069561,0,Sonographic appearance of gestational trophoblastic disease evolving into epithelioid trophoblastic tumor.,"Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor is a distinctive but rare trophoblastic tumor. It derives from intermediate trophoblastic cells of the chorion laeve and is usually associated with a previous gestational event. We report the case of a patient who had undergone dilatation and curettage for a missed miscarriage. Three months later gestational trophoblastic disease was suspected because of persistent vaginal bleeding and high levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG). Transvaginal ultrasound revealed irregular echolucent lacunae within the myometrium, some of them filled with low-resistance, turbulent blood flow on Doppler examination, emphasizing the diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease. The patient was treated with 12 courses of multiagent chemotherapy. After a 2-year remission, a low rise in serum beta-hCG was observed. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a well-circumscribed echogenic lesion with a diameter of 1.8 cm in the uterine fundus, with no detectable blood flow on Doppler imaging. A diagnosis of tumor of intermediate trophoblastic cells was suspected and total hysterectomy was performed. On pathological examination, the histological and immunohistochemical features were characteristic of epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. Most reported cases of epithelioid trophoblastic tumor have solitary nodules with sharp margins, which is consistent with our ultrasound findings. Ultrasound may be helpful in differentiating epithelioid trophoblastic tumor from placental-site trophoblastic tumor, another tumor of intermediate trophoblastic cells, which shows infiltrative growth insinuating between muscle fibers."
CD011126,0,20447724,0,Eccentrically located intrauterine pregnancy misdiagnosed as interstitial ectopic pregnancy.,"This is a case report of an eccentrically located intrauterine pregnancy initially diagnosed as an interstitial ectopic pregnancy. Although interstitial ectopic pregnancy represents a well-known pitfall in first-trimester sonography, the common error is to misidentify the ectopic pregnancy as intrauterine, not the reverse. Such an error is potentially catastrophic because it may lead to the inadvertent termination of a viable pregnancy. Although the role of ultrasonography for evaluation of ectopic pregnancy is well established, its diagnostic accuracy for interstitial ectopic pregnancy remains uncertain. Because of this, sonographic findings should be considered suggestive, but not diagnostic, in this setting."

We searched our database between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013, for all patients who had sonographic findings of suspected deep infiltrating endometriosis of the bowel with obliteration of the cul-de-sac. The medical record of each patient was examined retrospectively for evidence of surgical confirmation of disease. The sonographic appearance, shape, and size of the bowel wall lesions were evaluated to develop criteria for deep infiltrating endometriosis of the rectosigmoid and cul-de-sac. The search of our database revealed 35 patients with sonographic findings of pelvic bowel wall endometriosis associated with obliteration of the cul-de-sac. Ten of these patients had surgical confirmation of bowel wall endometriosis after the scan, and another 4 patients had surgical evidence of endometriosis from prior surgery. All of the patients who underwent surgery subsequent to sonography had confirmation of their bowel wall infiltrative endometriosis. Sonographically, the bowel lesions were solid, focal, and tubular with slightly irregular margins and in most cases a thinner section or a ""tail"" at one end, resembling a comet. This study confirms that bowel wall implants have a very characteristic appearance, and extending the transvaginal examination to include an evaluation of the rectosigmoid seeking these bowel lesions is valuable, especially in any patient presenting with a history of pelvic pain."

Both testicular microlithiasis and testicular cancer occurred chiefly in the third decade. Patients with TM exhibit a higher chance of testicular cancer (6% vs. 0.9%). No local field effect between TM and testicular cancer was observed. Testicular microlithiasis severity is not positively correlated with sperm quality and sterility. Forty-eight patients (32%) were available at follow-up. No patient developed a testicular tumor or elevated tumor markers (AFP, beta-hCG) during follow-up.

Both malignant and benign parovarian tumors may contain intracystic projections, so their presence is not a differentiating factor. We describe the cases of 2 patients with parovarian cystadenomas that were evaluated using sonography, MRI, and histopathology in an attempt to begin to identify the sonographic characteristics of such lesions and correlate them with MRI and histopathologic findings. In both cases, sonography revealed a cystic mass that contained multiple small intracystic mural nodules, most of which were associated with the ""Chinese hat"" artifact. MRI findings confirmed the presence of the cystic masses and the nodules. Histopathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of serous cystadenoma arising in a parovarian cyst; the intracystic nodules consisted of fibrotic tissue covered with a single layer of epithelium. Thus, the results of all 3 evaluations correlated well. This characteristic sonographic appearance may be useful in making an accurate preoperative diagnosis of parovarian cystadenomas."
CD011126,0,20875613,0,"An overview of the method, application, and various findings of computed tomographic colonography in patients after incomplete colonoscopy.","Colon cancer is the third most common malignancy in the USA with 154,000 new cases and 52,000 deaths in 2007. The current screening method is optical colonoscopy; however, the compliance rate of the screening population is very low. Computed tomographic (CT) colonography has been used as an alternative to optical colonoscopy as a screening method. The purpose of this article is to explain how CT colonography has been used as a supplemental screening tool in a subset of patients in whom optical colonoscopy was either incomplete or not possible. We examined a group of 222 patients at our institution in which a complete colonoscopy could not be performed for a variety of reasons. Routine CT colonography imaging of the insufflated colon was performed in both the supine and the prone positions with oral contrast. 3D reconstructed images were then obtained using Viatronix software and were interpreted along with the axial images. Each patient was classified into groups based on the quality/adequacy of the examination, presence, number, and size of polyps. The patients were also evaluated for any diverticula, benign lesions such as lipoma, stricture, or mass. In addition to its use as a primary screening tool, CT colonography can be used as an adjunct to optical colonoscopy as in our institution. A cooperative use of both screening modalities can result in a higher number of completed examinations when combining the results of both tests. On review of our 222 cases, there were 37 patients in whom the CT colonography was deemed incomplete for several reasons, including inadequate insufflation, persistent stricture, or incomplete preparation. Of these cases, when reviewing the previous incomplete colonoscopy report, 18 patients (49%) had a complete screening study when combining the results of both tests. In these cases, areas that could not be evaluated by CT colonography were properly screened with colonoscopy. A large number of patients in our study group were able to receive an essentially complete screening evaluation when both tests were combined. In the case of our study, the combination of both tests brought the rate of complete studies to 91%."
CD011126,0,23971251,0,Comparison of hysterosonography and hysteroscopy for diagnosing perimenopausal bleeding.,"This investigation was a prospective study performed at the Gynecological Clinic ""Narodni Front"" in Belgrade. In the investigated group, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyp, and myoma were diagnosed as the most frequent causes of bleeding during perimenopause. The test group of patients was then subjected to hysterosonography in order to diagnose bleeding etiology, followed by hysteroscopy to confirm its etiology based on hysterosonography. Material was sent for histopathological analysis to definitely confirm the diagnosis. The aim of this study was to the compare the findings of hysterosonography and hysteroscopy to evaluate the sensitivity and efficacy of hysterosonography for diagnosing the etiology of uterine bleeding in perimenopausal women. In the diagnostics of submucosal myoma, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial polyps, hysterosonography has proven to be a good screening method. By its use for diagnosing intracavitary uterine pathology, and thus also the pathology of bleeding in perimenopausal women, in many cases hysteroscopy can be avoided. This is a method that is easy to perform, less invasive, less costly to perform, and is well-tolerated."

A prospective analysis was carried out to determine the effect of endometrial thickness on IVF - embryo transfer/ICSI outcome in dedicated Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) units in Abuja and Rivers State, Nigeria. Two hundred and fifty one patients who met the inclusion criteria were analysed. They were grouped on the basis of endometrial thickness into 3 groups; <7 mm, 7 - 14 mm and >14 mm. The main outcome measure was clinical pregnancy. There were significantly more pregnancies in the 7 - 14 mm endometrial thickness group compared to the <7 mm and >14 mm groups, p=0.004 and p<0.0001 respectively. The findings suggest that following IVF/ICSI, significantly more pregnancies occurred when the endometrial thickness was between 7 and 14 mm."

CD011126,0,20038631,0,Accommodation of tmRNA-SmpB into stalled ribosomes: a cryo-EM study.,"In eubacteria, translation of defective messenger RNAs (mRNAs) produces truncated polypeptides that stall on the ribosome. A quality control mechanism referred to as trans-translation is performed by transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), a specialized RNA acting as both a tRNA and an mRNA, associated with small protein B (SmpB). So far, a clear view of the structural movements of both the protein and RNA necessary to perform accommodation is still lacking. By using a construct containing the tRNA-like domain as well as the extended helix H2 of tmRNA, we present a cryo-electron microscopy study of the process of accommodation. The structure suggests how tmRNA and SmpB move into the ribosome decoding site after the release of EF-Tu.GDP. While two SmpB molecules are bound per ribosome in a preaccommodated state, our results show that during accommodation the SmpB protein interacting with the small subunit decoding site stays in place while the one interacting with the large subunit moves away. Relative to canonical translation, an additional movement is observed due to the rotation of H2. This suggests that the larger movement required to resume translation on a tmRNA internal open reading frame starts during accommodation."

CD011126,0,18697551,0,Structure-analysis method for electronic cleansing in cathartic and noncathartic CT colonography.,"Electronic cleansing (EC) is an emerging method for segmentation of fecal material in CT colonography (CTC) that is used for reducing or eliminating the requirement for cathartic bowel preparation and hence for improving patients' adherence to recommendations for colon cancer screening. In EC, feces tagged by an x-ray-opaque oral contrast agent are removed from the CTC images, effectively cleansing the colon after image acquisition. Existing EC approaches tend to suffer from the following cleansing artifacts: degradation of soft-tissue structures because of pseudo-enhancement caused by the surrounding tagged fecal materials, and pseudo soft-tissue structures and false fistulas caused by partial volume effects at the boundary between the air lumen and the tagged regions, called the air-tagging boundary (AT boundary). In this study, we developed a novel EC method, called structure-analysis cleansing, which effectively avoids these cleansing artifacts. In our method, submerged soft-tissue structures are recognized by their local morphologic signatures that are characterized based on the eigenvalues of a three-dimensional Hessian matrix. A structure-enhancement function is formulated for enhancing of the soft-tissue structures. In addition, thin folds sandwiched between the air lumen and tagged regions are enhanced by analysis of the local roughness based on multi-scale volumetric curvedness. Both values of the structure-enhancement function and the local roughness are integrated into the speed function of a level set method for delineating the tagged fecal materials. Thus, submerged soft-tissue structures as well as soft-tissue structures adhering to the tagged regions are preserved, whereas the tagged regions are removed along with the associated AT boundaries from CTC images. Evaluation of the quality of the cleansing based on polyps and folds in a colon phantom, as well as on polyps in clinical cathartic and noncathartic CTC cases with fluid and stool tagging, showed that our structure-analysis cleansing method is significantly superior to that of our previous thresholding-based EC method. It provides a cleansed colon with substantially reduced subtraction artifacts."

During the complex 4D chain of this procedure image-assistance is provided for disease assessment, provisional treatment planning (""pre-planning""), applicator placement and reconstruction, as well as for contouring, definitive treatment planning and quality control of dose delivery. With IGABT changes of topography adjacent to the applicator, caused by tumour regression, oedema, organ changes and dilation are identified. Thus, the CTV for IGABT is primarily based on the tumour volume at the time of BT and takes into account both time and spatial domains. IGABT requires systematic concepts for target, OAR, biological modelling, DVH analysis, and dose-volume-adaptation."

CD011126,0,16873035,0,Hydrosalpinx with adnexal torsion in an adolescent virgin patient--A diagnostic dilemma: case report and review of the literature.,"Hydrosalpinx is one of the predisposing factors of adnexal torsion. However, because the incidence of hydrosalpinx in adolescent virgin patients is very rare, it may cause diagnostic dilemma, leading sometimes to suboptimal treatment. We present the case of an 18-yr-old female, not sexually active, presenting with acute lower right abdominal pain. The working diagnosis was of a simple ovarian cyst, so aspiration was performed. Abdominal symptoms reoccurred and sonography revealed a large hemorrhagic cystic mass adjacent to an edematous right ovary. The patient was referred to immediate laparoscopy due to suspected right adnexal torsion. On laparoscopy, the right adnexa was twisted three times causing an edematous ovary with a hematosalpinx. Detorsion was performed. Five weeks later, transabdominal ultrasound reviled normal bilateral ovaries and the hematosalpinx disappeared. In conclusion, hydrosalpinx, although very rare in adolescence, must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Aspiration in such cases is not the treatment of choice and moreover, it may cause complications."

Ovarian volume was calculated in 20 patients by two observers using both the ""prolate ellipsoid formula"" and a new 3-D rotational technique (VOCAL). There was a significant difference between observers in mean ovarian volume calculated by the prolate ellipsoid formula (31.54 mL vs. 26.54 mL: p < 0.05), which proved to be a significantly less reliable technique than 3-D rotational volume calculation with VOCAL. Image quality was significantly better (p < 0.001) and measurements were significantly more reliable (p < 0.05) in the B-plane than in the C- plane of the multiplanar display. Rotational measurement of ovarian volume from 3-D US data is significantly more reliable between observers than volume estimation from 2-D parameters using the prolate ellipsoid formula, but is dependent upon image quality, which is significantly better in the B-plane than in the C-plane."

CD011126,0,24034729,0,GPU-accelerated 3D mipmap for real-time visualization of ultrasound volume data.,"Ultrasound volume rendering is an efficient method for visualizing the shape of fetuses in obstetrics and gynecology. However, in order to obtain high-quality ultrasound volume rendering, noise removal and coordinates conversion are essential prerequisites. Ultrasound data needs to undergo a noise filtering process; otherwise, artifacts and speckle noise cause quality degradation in the final images. Several two-dimensional (2D) noise filtering methods have been used to reduce this noise. However, these 2D filtering methods ignore relevant information in-between adjacent 2D-scanned images. Although three-dimensional (3D) noise filtering methods are used, they require more processing time than 2D-based methods. In addition, the sampling position in the ultrasonic volume rendering process has to be transformed between conical ultrasound coordinates and Cartesian coordinates. We propose a 3D-mipmap-based noise reduction method that uses graphics hardware, as a typical 3D mipmap requires less time to be generated and less storage capacity. In our method, we compare the density values of the corresponding points on consecutive mipmap levels and find the noise area using the difference in the density values. We also provide a noise detector for adaptively selecting the mipmap level using the difference of two mipmap levels. Our method can visualize 3D ultrasound data in real time with 3D noise filtering."

The presence of a homogeneous echogenic pattern, with marked posterior acoustic shadowing, in the absence of any calcification, was highly suggestive of a predominantly fibrous ovarian fibrothecoma; the presence of a diffusely hypoechoic ovarian mass, with no posterior echo enhancement, was strikingly correlated with pure thecomas; mixed fibrothecomas were characterized by the presence of an echogenic pattern with no posterior acoustic shadowing. Sonographic findings, even though nonspecific, can provide the clinician with useful information which permits to detect these rare neoplasms preoperatively."

CD011126,0,19203059,0,Socio-demographic factors and cervical length in pregnancy.,"The cervical length is an important factor in the risk evaluation of preterm delivery. The aim of this work was to determine the correlation between the cervical length and the demographic characteristics. A transversal type prospective study was done on a sample of 579 pregnant women at various gestational age of low risk mono-fetal pregnancy. The cervical length was measured by trans-vaginal ultrasound procedure within the regular pregnancy monitoring process. The following data were taken into consideration: the woman's age, her body mass at the beginning of the pregnancy and her height in order to calculate the body mass index as well as her smoking habit at the moment of conception. The mean cervical length was 34.3 mm and 35 mm in the group of women aged 30 and less and 31 and over, respectively. The cervix was insignificantly shorter in younger women (being 34.9 mm/35.9 mm in the 1st trimester, 34.5 mm/35.1 mm in the 2nd one and 33.9 mm/34.7 mm in the 3rd trimester). The sample of 579 pregnant women consisted of 448 non-smokers and 131 smokers. The difference in the length of the cervix in smokers and nonsmokers was not significant (being 32.2 mm/35.9 mm; 35 mm/34 mm and 34.4 mm/33.5 mm in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively). The correlation between the body mass index and the cervical length was analyzed by trimesters. In the first trimester the increase in the body mass index was followed by the shortening of the cervix; the cervical length was not affected by the BAI in the second trimester, whereas the higher the body mass index the longer the cervix in the third trimester. Our study has shown that the cervical length is affected neither by the age of the woman nor her smoking habit but it is affected by the body mass index at the moment of conception, that linear trend being negative in the 1st trimester but positive in the 3rd one. Since the cervical length may be affected not only by the socio-demographic characteristics but the gynecologic obstetric history of the woman as well, we strongly suggest further investigations in this field."

CD011126,0,14735827,0,Current trends in chest wall malignant tumor.,"Surgery used to treat chest wall sarcomas requires preoperative evaluation in order to document their margins, and to reveal any nodules of recurrence. Because of its considerable sensitivity and specificity ultrasound was associated with routine imaging techniques. The results obtained are useful in defining superficial and lateral tumor margins, but particularly in determining micro-nodules of recurrence which would otherwise go unrecognized. Based on the data obtained using routine methods of diagnosis and ultrasound, we submitted patients to excision that each and every time proved to be wide on histological examination. A particular surgical method was used for reconstruction, involving a polypropylene mesh fixed to one or two mouldable plates. This method exploits the elasticity of polypropylene, which is indispensable for the correct respiratory dynamics of the rib cage, thus avoiding paradoxical or harmful movement. Oncological and functional results were satisfactory."

Dose-volume histograms were compared between matched conventional and optimized plans in 22 patients who were treated by MRI-based ICR. Doses to organs-at-risk (OAR) and dose covering 90% of high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) were evaluated to compare OAR sparing and target coverage, respectively. The probability of RTOG rectal toxicity grade of ≥2 in the 22 patients was estimated based on the prediction model generated from previous three-dimensional CT-based ICR data. After optimization, doses to OAR showed a statistically significant decrease. The reduction percentage (reduced dose by optimization x 100/dose in the conventional plan) was higher in patients with HR-CTV >20 cc than in patients with HR-CTV >20 cc in the rectum. In patients with HR-CTV ≤ 20 cc, the mean probability of RTOG rectal toxicity grade ≥ 2 was 67.6% for the conventional plan and 47.8% for the optimized plan, based on the prediction model. In conclusion, dose adaptation by MRI-based ICR for cervical cancer resulted in significant dose reduction to the rectum, especially in patients with HR-CTV ≤ 20 cc."

A prospective study of 60 infertility patients was conducted in which the endometrium was evaluated sonographically, both before and after laparoscopy. Prior to laparoscopy, the mean endometrial thickness was 10.5 +/- 1.9 mm in the group without endometriosis (n = 20) and 11.7 +/- 2.8 mm in the group with endometriosis (n = 40) (p > 0.05). Following the laparoscopy, there was no change in the mean thickness within each group. The incidence of an unfavorable echo pattern was negligible in both groups. Endometriosis does not cause a reduction in endometrial thickness, nor does it appear to influence the development of an unfavorable echo pattern at time of peak follicular maturation."

Treatments for luteal phase defects included progesterone supplementation with or without follicle-maturing drugs, depending on whether the patient attained a follicle of at least 18 mm and a serum estradiol of > 200 pg/ml. No differences in pregnancy rates were found by the thickness of endometrium (< 10 vs. > or = 10 mm) or echo pattern in any of the treatment modalities. Thus, contrary to findings in stimulated cycles for in vitro fertilization, endometrial thickness at the time of peak follicular maturation is not predictive of outcome in patients treated for luteal phase defects in natural cycles."

CD011126,0,20409788,0,Analysis of the ciliary/flagellar beating of Chlamydomonas.,"Eukaryotic flagella and cilia are alternative names, for the slender cylindrical protrusions of a cell (240nm diameter, approximately 12,800nm-long in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) that propel a cell or move fluid. Cilia are extraordinarily successful complex organelles abundantly found in animals performing many tasks. They play a direct or developmental role in the sensors of fluid flow, light, sound, gravity, smells, touch, temperature, and taste in mammals. The failure of cilia can lead to hydrocephalus, infertility, and blindness. However, in spite of their large role in human function and pathology, there is as yet no consensus on how cilia beat and perform their many functions, such as moving fluids in brain ventricles and lungs and propelling and steering sperm, larvae, and many microorganisms. One needs to understand and analyze ciliary beating and its hydrodynamic interactions. This chapter provides a guide for measuring, analyzing, and interpreting ciliary behavior in various contexts studied in the model system of Chlamydomonas. It describes: (1) how cilia work as self-organized beating structures (SOBSs), (2) the overlaid control in the cilia that optimizes the SOBS to achieve cell dispersal, phototaxis steering, and avoidance of obstacles, (3) the assay of a model intracellular signal processing system that responds to multiple external and internal inputs, choosing mode of behavior and then controlling the cilia, (4) how cilia sense their environment, and (5) potentially an assay of ciliary performance for toxicology or medical assessment."

Twenty-five women who were to undergo surgical curettage due to suspected retained placental tissue were included. The volume of the uterine body and cavity was measured using the VOCAL imaging program. Twenty-one women had retained placental tissue histologically verified. Three of these had uterine volumes exceeding the largest volume observed in the normal puerperium. Seventeen of the 21 women had a uterine cavity volume exceeding the largest volume observed in the normal puerperium. In all 14 cases examined 28 days or more after delivery the cavity volume exceeded the largest volume observed in the normal puerperium. A large cavity volume estimated with 3D ultrasound is indicative of retained placental tissue. However, 3D ultrasound adds little or no diagnostic power compared to 2D ultrasound."
CD011126,0,22116070,0,Adenomyosis and infertility.,"Today an accurate diagnosis of adenomyosis can be made thanks to progress in imaging techniques: sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This has made it possible to clinically correlate the presence of adenomyosis to infertility. At the same time, a series of pathogenetic hypotheses have been presented to explain this correlation. First, the identification of the myometrial junctional zone (JZ) and of its disruption and thickening has been linked to poor reproductive performance mainly through perturbed uterine peristalsis, a phenomenon that originates exclusively from the JZ in the nonpregnant uterus. In addition, a number of biochemical and functional alterations in both eutopic and heterotopic endometrium in women with adenomyosis have now been found to lead to lower receptivity, indicated by the presence of 'implantation marker' defects. In these patients there is also an altered decidualization and abnormal concentrations of intrauterine free radicals. All these abnormalities in the endometrial environment seem to contribute to subfertility. Several attempts have been made to restore fertility in adenomyosis patients, the oldest being gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists coupled to conservative surgery. Also, uterine artery embolization and MRI-assisted high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation have been tried with some degree of success."

Her initial ultrasound scan was inconclusive, and so serial serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) blood tests were carried out. These demonstrated a suboptimal increase. A second transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) was therefore performed, which showed a live cervical ectopic pregnancy. The patient, who remained haemodynamically stable, was admitted. She was treated with intramuscular methotrexate. She was given a second dose of methotrexate after 1&emsp14;week, since her beta hCG levels did not demonstrate a satisfactory fall. A rapid decrease in serum hCG was then observed and the patient was then discharged. An outpatient TVUS was normal. The patient remained well throughout her treatment, never suffered any profuse vaginal bleeding, and thus surgical intervention was avoided."

CD011126,0,21663871,0,Non-fatal gunshot wounds in the context of intimate partner violence. The importance of a multidisciplinary approach: a case report.,"According to Portuguese law, if a case of intimate partner violence is noticed or suspected by a professional working in public services, reporting it to the police, medico-legal services or directly to the public prosecutor is mandatory. However, in most cases, reporting does not take place, despite its vital importance in triggering the multidisciplinary intervention that will ensure the correct and timely diagnosis and protection of the victim. In the present case, the victim, a 37 year-old woman, was sexually and physically abused by her husband in their home, and was physically abused again at the victim's mother's house. The victim mentioned that her husband struck her in the head with a hammer and shot a handgun while in her mother's house. However, she denied having a gunshot wound. The couple's daughter was also slapped in the face by her father. The police took the victim to the emergency room of a central hospital to receive medical attention, while the medical examiner on duty was called to the same emergency room to perform a medico-legal evaluation in the context of the intimate partner violence reported to the police. Medico-legal assessment revealed scalp injuries that had not been detected during the first inspection by the emergency room attending physicians who had performed a neurological examination, which revealed no neurological dysfunction. A cranial computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstitution and virtual dissection, requested by the medical examiner, revealed two projectiles trapped in between the inner and the outer table of the cranium, with linear fractures only in the inner table and no brain injuries. Gynecological examination with the collection of biological evidence, also performed by the medical examiner, made it possible to identify a male DNA profile matching her husband's. The victim was subjected to neurosurgery and a follow-up, and was released one month after the traumatic event. A forensic psychological evaluation, performed one month after the traumatic event, revealed the presence of reactive symptoms to the occurrence. This multidisciplinary intervention and the use of modern diagnosis imaging techniques allowed for a timely diagnosis and treatment, adequate protection of the victim and her family, as well as the identification of the aggressor, who was arrested."

Baseline day-2 serum FSH and blood levels taken on days 5 and 6 of human menopausal gonadotropin therapy were not different in the hyper-responders from those responding normally. The only significant difference in serum FSH was seen on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin where it was actually lower in the hyper-responders. Thus, there does not appear to be a critical serum FSH level which would dictate a decrease in gonadotropins to prevent hyper-response."

Physical exam was notable for bilateral adnexal tenderness and a closed cervix without motion tenderness or discharge. Laboratory data demonstrated a beta HCG level of 7,787 IU/L, and pelvic ultrasound with transvaginal imaging was subsequently performed. Neither an adnexal mass nor a normal intrauterine pregnancy was demonstrable; however, a focal right fundal 7-cm area of heterogeneous echogenicity was observed. Initial findings were felt indeterminate with considerations including potential degenerating leiomyoma coexistent with a nonvisualized intrauterine pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or recent spontaneous abortion versus atypical interstitial ectopic pregnancy. The patient, initially declining further clinical intervention, returned within 24 h with continued pain. A repeat ultrasound demonstrated a relatively static and unchanged appearance with only a minimal concurrent interval increase in beta HCG levels. MRI was performed for further elucidation and demonstrated a heterogeneously hypervascular right fundal interstitial 6-cm mass, which, in the clinical context, was most suspicious for an ectopic pregnancy.

The surgical staging proposed by the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology is the most universally used, and International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology encourages the use of imaging techniques to assess prognostic factors, such as resectable disease and lymph node status. Identifying the volume and locations of tumor is valuable in planning percutaneous tissue biopsy, triaging patients to either primary cytoreductive surgery, or primary platinum-based chemotherapy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the modality of choice for the staging of ovarian carcinoma, with magnetic resonance imaging being used as a problem-solving tool. In this article we discuss and illustrate the staging of ovarian carcinoma, with emphasis on the current imaging modalities and optimal image acquisition."

CD011126,0,21397490,0,Comparison of computed tomography scout based reference point localization to conventional film and axial computed tomography.,"Identification of source positions after implantation is an important step in brachytherapy planning. Reconstruction is traditionally performed from films taken by conventional simulators, but these are gradually being replaced in the clinic by computed tomography (CT) simulators. The present study explored the use of a scout image-based reconstruction algorithm that replaces the use of traditional film, while exhibiting low sensitivity to metal-induced artifacts that can appear in 3D CT methods. In addition, the accuracy of an in-house graphical software implementation of scout-based reconstruction was compared with seed location reconstructions for 2 phantoms by conventional simulator and CT measurements. One phantom was constructed using a planar fixed grid of 1.5-mm diameter ball bearings (BBs) with 40-mm spacing. The second was a Fletcher-Suit applicator embedded in Styrofoam (Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI) with one 3.2-mm-diameter BB inserted into each of 6 surrounding holes. Conventional simulator, kilovoltage CT (kVCT), megavoltage CT, and scout-based methods were evaluated by their ability to calculate the distance between seeds (40 mm for the fixed grid, 30-120 mm in Fletcher-Suit). All methods were able to reconstruct the fixed grid distances with an average deviation of <1%. The worst single deviations (approximately 6%) were exhibited in the 2 volumetric CT methods. In the Fletcher-Suit phantom, the intermodality agreement was within approximately 3%, with the conventional sim measuring marginally larger distances, with kVCT the smallest. All of the established reconstruction methods exhibited similar abilities to detect the distances between BBs. The 3D CT-based methods, with lower axial resolution, showed more variation, particularly with the smaller BBs. With a software implementation, scout-based reconstruction is an appealing approach because it simplifies data acquisition over film-based reconstruction without requiring any specialized equipment and does not carry risk of misreads caused by artifacts."

However, lesions will occasionally be indeterminate because of overlapping features and will require further evaluation with endoscopy.

CD011126,0,24912094,0,An unexpected mass of the urachus: a case report.,"The urachus is a remnant of the urogenital sinus and allantois, which persists after antenatal involution. Despite its rudimentary postnatal presence, it can undergo metaplasia and tumor formation. Malignant transformation of the urachus is rare. However, these tumors can recur and develop pseudomyxoma peritonei. Thus, they should remain on the differential for any female patient with a pelvic mass. A 28-year old G9P2062 presented at 8 weeks' gestation requesting pregnancy termination. On ultrasound, a single live intrauterine pregnancy was visualized. Also identified was a left-sided 8- × 7- × 6-cm complex echogenic mass with thickened septations, heterogeneous appearance, and fluid-fluid levels suspicious for a mature cystic teratoma. Surgical termination of pregnancy and diagnostic laparoscopy was planned. Intraoperatively a multiloculated midline mass was identified and excised. Final pathology identified a mucinous urachal neoplasm of low malignant potential. The patient followed up with urology and underwent surgical staging. Midline location is a key feature that helps distinguish ovarian masses from urachal or bladder masses. Many urachal and bladder neoplasms are managed with complete surgical excision and staging, illustrating the importance of preoperative identification. If laterality of a mass is unclear, further imaging is recommended to characterize the mass preoperatively. This case also reveals the feasibility of a minimally invasive abdominal wall mass resection."

Randomized controlled trials, which compared single vs double layers and locking vs unlocking sutures for uterine closure of low transverse cesarean, were included. Outcomes were short-term complications (endometritis, wound infection, maternal infectious morbidity, blood transfusion, duration of surgical procedure, length of hospital stay, mean blood loss), uterine rupture or dehiscence at next pregnancy, and uterine scar evaluation by ultrasound. Twenty of 1278 citations were included in the analysis. We found that all types of closure were comparable for short-term maternal outcomes, except for single-layer closure, which had shorter operative time (-6.1 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.7 to -3.4; P < .001) than double-layer closure. Single layer (-2.6 mm; 95% CI, -3.1 to -2.1; P < .001) and locked first layer (mean difference, -2.5 mm; 95% CI, -3.2 to -1.8; P < .001) were associated with lower residual myometrial thickness. Two studies reported no significant difference between single- vs double-layer closure for uterine dehiscence (relative risk, 1.86; 95% CI, 0.44-7.90; P = .40) or uterine rupture (no case). In conclusion, current evidence based on randomized trials does not support a specific type of uterine closure for optimal maternal outcomes and is insufficient to conclude about the risk of uterine rupture. Single-layer closure and locked first layer are possibly coupled with thinner residual myometrium thickness."

CD011126,0,14685671,0,[Virtual colonography].,"Recent technical developments in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have made a virtual presentation of the colon possible. The results of clinical investigations comparing virtual colonography and conventional colonoscopy up to now are promising. Virtual colonography is a potential tool for colorectal carcinoma screening in the future, but it still has an unsatisfactory sensitivity for the detection of small and flat lesions and exposes the patient to substantial doses of ionizing radiation. Recent investigations using ultra-low-dose (< 2 mSv) multislice CT colonography show promising results. Magnetic resonance (MR) colonography as a radiation-free modality is the technique of the future. Although encouraging results using virtual MR colonography for the detection of colorectal polyps have been reported, the sensitivity of detecting small polyps (</= 10 mm) and flat lesions is poor. Main reason is the limited spatial resolution in MRI of the colon. The potential role of virtual colonography in the prevention of colorectal cancer is not yet clear. Larger studies with asymptomatic persons at average risk are needed, and further improvements in the detection of flat and very small (< 5 mm) lesions need to be achieved before advocating the use of virtual colonography for routine colorectal cancer screening."

It is a surgical emergency treated with either detorsion or salpingectomy. The imaging findings can be nonspecific and challenging. However, an accurate early diagnosis is essential for prompt surgical treatment. Our objective was to review whether imaging findings can be specific enough to suggest the diagnosis of tubal torsion prospectively in the appropriate clinical setting. An Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective review of our imaging database from 2005 to 2012 revealed 10 surgically proven cases of fallopian tube torsion. All cases had sonography performed; 5 cases had additional multidetector computed tomography. All 10 patients (9-17 years) presented with acute pelvic pain. Sonographic findings included dilated tubular structures in 6 of 10 cases: adjacent to a normal ipsilateral ovary in 5 of 6 and adjacent to a benign ovarian teratoma in 1. In 4 cases, no dilated tube was identified; 3 of 4 had a cystic mass separate from the ovaries, and 1 had the imaging appearance of a multicystic ovary. Computed tomographic findings in the 5 cases that underwent multidetector computed tomography included a dilated tubular structure in 3 of 5; 2 of 5 had a cystic adnexal mass identified. Although rare, tubal torsion should be considered in female adolescents with acute pelvic pain. Sonography should be the first imaging choice. When a tubular structure or a midline cystic mass associated with a normal ipsilateral ovary is noted, tubal torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis."

CD011126,0,25599825,0,Nuclear volume differences between balanced and unbalanced spermatozoa in chromosomal translocation carriers.,"While chromosomal translocations are usually associated with a normal phenotype, they can still cause male infertility as well as recurrent miscarriages and fetal malformations related to their transmission in an unbalanced state. The distinction between balanced and unbalanced spermatozoa on morphological criteria is still unfeasible. However, we previously showed that: i) spermatozoa with an unbalanced content have a higher rate of DNA fragmentation; and ii) that density gradient centrifugation partially separates balanced from unbalanced sperm cells. We hypothesized that a chromosomal imbalance could alter the fine spermatic nuclear architecture and consequently the condensation of DNA, thus modifying normal sperm density. Spermatic nuclear volumes in four translocation carriers were analyzed using confocal microscopy. Secondarily, FISH analysis was used to establish the segregation mode of each spermatozoon. We found the average spermatic nuclei size to be higher among unbalanced spermatozoa in all patients but one. All the unbalanced modes were associated with larger nuclei in two patients, while this was the case for the 3:1 mode only in the other two, suggesting an abnormal condensation. This could be the first step in elaborating a procedure to completely eliminate unbalanced spermatozoa from semen prior to in vitro fertilization."

Heterozygous germline mutations in PALB2 predispose to breast cancer and biallelic mutations cause FA. FA proteins play a critical role in the telomere maintenance pathway, with telomeric shortening observed in FA cells. Less is known about telomere maintenance in the heterozygous state. Here, we investigate the roles of PALB2 heterozygous mutations in genomic instability, an important carcinogenesis precursor. Patient-derived lymphoblastoid (LCL) and fibroblast (FCL) cell lines with monoallelic truncating PALB2 mutations were investigated using a combination of molecular imaging techniques including centromeric FISH, telomeric Q-FISH and spectral karyotyping (SKY). Mitomycin C and Cisplatin sensitivity was assayed via cellular metabolism of WST-1. The PALB2 c.229delT FCL showed increases in telomere counts associated with increased mean intensity compared with two wild-type FCLs generated from first-degree relatives (P =1.04E-10 and P =9.68E-15) and it showed evidence of chromosomal rearrangements. Significant differences in centromere distribution were observed in one of three PALB2 heterozygous FCLs analyzed when compared with PALB2 wild-type, BRCA1 and BRCA2 heterozygous FCLs. No significant consistently increased sensitivity to Mitomycin C or Cisplatin was observed in LCLs. Our results are suggestive of an altered centromere distribution profile and a telomere instability phenotype. Together, these may indicate critical nuclear organization defects associated with the predisposition to transformation and early stage development of PALB2-related cancers."

Ultrasound scans were used to detect ureteric obstructions in the follow-up period. Significant progressive ureteric obstruction occurred in 6 patients (7.2%), all of whom had malignant strictures. The diagnoses of these strictures were made between 8 months and five years after the Initial treatment. Patients having malignant stricture tend to be in a higher original stage of tumour. The lower ureter was the site of ureteric obstruction in 4 patients while 2 had lesions in middle ureter. The latency period between primary treatment of the tumour and diagnosis of uropathy is significantly shorter for malignant strictures. The site of occurrence of the strictures had no discernible significance but the absence of a bilateral obstruction in spite of all of them being malignant lesions is in disagreement with the published data."

CD011126,0,14704263,0,Polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome have chronic anovulation and androgen excess not attributable to another cause. This condition occurs in approximately 4% of women. The fundamental pathophysiologic defect is unknown, but important characteristics include insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and altered gonadotropin dynamics. Inadequate follicle-stimulating hormone is hypothesized to be a proximate cause of anovulation. Obesity frequently complicates polycystic ovarian syndrome but is not a defining characteristic. The diagnostic approach should be based largely on history and physical examination, thus avoiding numerous laboratory tests that don't contribute to clinical management. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome typically present because of irregular bleeding, hirsutism, and/or infertility. These conditions can be treated directly with oral contraceptives, oral contraceptives plus spironolactone, and ovulation induction, respectively. However, women with polycystic ovarian syndrome also have a substantially higher prevalence of diabetes and increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease. They should also be screened, therefore, for these conditions and followed closely if any risk factors are uncovered. For obese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, behavioral weight management is a central component of the overall treatment strategy."

The ages of the patients ranged from 20-41 (mean 29.6+/-5.8) years. After physical examination, hormone assay, testis biopsy, and confirming normal spermatogenesis, we have performed 23 alloplastic spermatoceles from the tunica vaginal layers in 11 patients. We retrieved sperms and performed IUI in 6 patients' wives 3 months post-operation when scrotal sonography revealed spermatocele with a good volume of seminal liquid. Among 6 patients' wives, 2 successful pregnancies occurred, and 2 normal babies (one boy with normal bilateral vas and one girl) were delivered successfully by cesarean section. We conclude that although the method of choice for fertility in BVA in artificial reproductive therapy era is percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), but when the sophisticated facilities are not available or cost-effectiveness is matter of concern, alloplastic spermatocele from tunica vaginalis and IUI may be a viable option."

Uterine rupture is rare even after a prior cesarean delivery, permitting a trial of labor after a cesarean delivery in spite of the increased risk of uterine rupture.

CD011126,0,22846530,0,Ovarian masses in adolescent girls.,"Ovarian masses are the most frequent gynecological pathology seen in adolescent girls. Functional or organic tumors of the ovary are usually benign and the incidence rises with age. Most cysts are functional and adnexal torsion is the main complication, but a malignant etiology must nevertheless always be eliminated. The clinical presentation is quite variable. Ultrasonography is the investigation of choice: the sonogram will reveal a strictly fluid, benign functional cyst, suggest an adnexal torsion, and provide evidence of a heterogeneous mass. Emergency surgery is indicated only in the case of suspected ovarian torsion, in order to perform detorsion. In all other cases, serum tumor marker measurements will orient the diagnosis and MRI is an essential complement to imaging of tumors with heterogeneous solid components. Surgery and histopathological examination then determine the stage and the benign or malignant nature of the mass. Ovarian tumors are classified by the World Health Organization based on the cell of origin into epithelial tumors, germ cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors. Surgery should always follow oncological standards and be as conservative as possible to preserve future fertility."

Because PCOS is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in growing FN, we investigated whether an increased AMH serum level correlates to other hormonal and/or U/S features of PCOS. Serum AMH has been assayed in 104 women (59 symptomatic PCOS, 45 controls) between d 2 and 7 after the last either spontaneous or progestin-induced (in PCOS) menstrual period. Mean serum AMH level was markedly increased in the PCOS group (47.1 +/- 22.9 vs. 20.8 +/- 11.6 pmol/liter in controls; P < 0.0001), an increase in the same order of magnitude as the one of the FN in the 2- to 5-mm range at U/S (12.8 +/- 8.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.9; P < 0.0001, respectively). The ratio AMH/FN was similar between the two groups (4.8 +/- 3.4 vs. 4.8 +/- 2.9; P = 0.55). By simple regression, both in PCOS and controls, the AMH level was positively related to the 2- to 5-mm FN at U/S (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.03, respectively), but not to the 6- to 9-mm FN, and was negatively correlated to the serum FSH level (P < 0.02 and P < 0.04, respectively). AMH was also positively related to the serum testosterone and androstenedione levels, in PCOS exclusively (P < 0.0005 and <0.002, respectively). No relationship was found between AMH and age, serum estradiol, inhibin B, and LH levels in both groups. After multiple regression only the 2- to 5-mm FN remained significantly related to AMH in PCOS whereas testosterone, androstenedione, and FSH were no longer. In conclusion, the assay of the serum AMH may represent an important breakthrough in the diagnosis and in the understanding of PCOS. Our data suggest that the increase of AMH serum level in PCOS is the consequence of the androgen-induced excess in small antral FN and that each follicle produces a normal amount of AMH. We hypothesize that an increased AMH tone within the cohort could be involved in the follicular arrest of PCOS, by interacting negatively with FSH at the time of selection."

There were no statistical significant differences in overall diagnostic performance for the preoperative and intraoperative assessment of cervical involvement, although frozen section seemed to be slightly superior to the imaging techniques. TVS and MRI have similar performance in determination of cervical involvement. However, although time consuming and expensive, MRI may be recommended in cases with poor quality TVS.

CD011126,0,15026588,0,Spectrum of germ cell tumors: from head to toe.,"Germ cell tumors (GCTs) occur most frequently in the gonads and are relatively rare in other sites, such as the pineal gland, neurohypophysis, mediastinum, and retroperitoneum. GCTs are thought to originate from primordial germ cells, which migrate to the primitive gonadal glands in the urogenital ridge. Extragonadal GCTs might also originate from these cells when the cells are sequestered during their migration. Pathologic subtypes of GCTs vary, and the prevalence of mixed tumors is high. These factors produce a diversity of radiologic findings and make prospective radiologic diagnosis difficult in many cases. However, similar radiologic findings have been observed in pathologically equivalent tumors in varying sites. Seminomas appear as uniformly solid, lobulated masses with fibrovascular septa that enhance intensely. Nonseminomatous GCTs appear as heterogeneous masses with areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, or cystic degeneration. Fat and calcifications are hallmarks of teratomas, most of which are benign. In immature teratomas, scattered fat and calcification within larger solid components are occasionally seen. These imaging characteristics reflect the pathologic features of each tumor, and histologically similar GCTs at varying sites have similar radiologic features. Knowledge of the pathologic appearances of GCTs and their corresponding radiologic appearances will allow radiologists to diagnose these tumors correctly."

CD011126,0,16832043,0,The human endometrium as a fertility-determining factor.,"Intensive research work has been performed to better understand the regulation of the endometrium and its clinical implications to improve implantation. Although many proteins and molecules may influence endometrial development, their co-ordinated contribution to the implantation process is still poorly understood and a translation into clinical use has not sufficiently been performed. Clinical evaluation of the endometrium by ultrasound and other techniques, like endometrial biopsy and analysis of uterine secretions, has been intensively studied and therapeutic options to improve endometrial function have been suggested and tested. Systemic treatment with heparin, aspirin or corticosteroids did not result in improved implantation rates. Gene therapy and cervical treatment, e.g. with seminal plasma, are still in the phase of clinical research. Therefore, this review focuses on different aspects of endometrial research, which all contribute to the diagnosis, evaluation and therapy of endometrial function and dysfunction.

CD011126,0,22779960,0,Uterine pseudoaneurysm leakage may cause delayed postpartum haemorrhage: multidetector CT with angiography and transcatheter uterine arterial embolisation.,"The aim of this retrospective case study was to evaluate the role of transcatheter arterial embolisation in the management of delayed postpartum haemorrhage due to pseudoaneurysm leakage, and present the angiographic findings with multidetector computed tomography (CT) along angiography as a diagnostic tool. Delayed postpartum haemorrhage due to pseudoaneurysm leakage was diagnosed in eight patients at our institution between October 2006 and June 2010. The mean patient age was 31.0 years and the mean parity, 2.0. Bilateral uterine arterial embolisation was performed in all patients. No additional embolisation sessions or hysterectomies were performed. Multidetector computed tomography with angiography helped to demonstrate the location and originating vessels of the pseudoaneurysm via fast and clear 3D images. Transcatheter uterine arterial embolisation is an option in haemodynamically stable patients, and it appears to be the treatment of choice."

A new sonographic approach for the quantitative assessment of endometrial echogenicity.,"A computer program was developed to assess the endometrial echogenicity relative to the myometrial one, based on the gray-level processing of the midsagittal uterine image. The endometrial region of interest was specified within the upper part of the uterine cavity. The adjacent area of the myometrium was used to determine the reference brightness. The endometrial region of interest was analyzed along the anteroposterior uterine axis, as a set of thin strips directed parallelly to the midcavitary line. The endometrial/myometrial relative echogenicity coefficient (E/M REC) was computed for each strip and displayed graphically as a function of the distance from the midcavitary line. The area under the E/M REC curve within the limits of the total endometrial width was defined as total area (TA) and was used as a measure of the endometrial echogenicity. This parameter was assessed in 9 patients during their normal ovulatory cycles and in 29 IVF-treated patients with mechanical infertility. TA has a significant linear increase during the days of the ovulatory cycles. TA was found in high correlation with log(estradiol). TA can be used reliably for sonographic endometrial dating in ovulatory cycles."

With the use of software for automatic measurement of volume of blocks (VOCAL, Kretztechnik, Austria) vascular indices (VI, Fl, VFI) and endometrial volume (EV) were estimated. Based on histopathological estimation of endometrium the patients were divided into the following groups: atrophic, proliferative, secretive endometrium, hyperplasia and endometrial cancer (EC). Mean EV in women with EC amounted to 16.82 ml and was significantly higher (p < 0.005) than in women with hyperplasia or without pathological changes. Mean values of vascular indices VI, Fl and VFI in the group of women with EC amounted to respectively 5.464; 25.995 and 1.898 and were also significantly higher in comparison to remaining groups of patients.

CD011126,0,20975175,0,Supine and prone colon registration using quasi-conformal mapping.,"In virtual colonoscopy, CT scans are typically acquired with the patient in both supine (facing up) and prone (facing down) positions. The registration of these two scans is desirable so that the user can clarify situations or confirm polyp findings at a location in one scan with the same location in the other, thereby improving polyp detection rates and reducing false positives. However, this supine-prone registration is challenging because of the substantial distortions in the colon shape due to the patient's change in position. We present an efficient algorithm and framework for performing this registration through the use of conformal geometry to guarantee that the registration is a diffeomorphism (a one-to-one and onto mapping). The taeniae coli and colon flexures are automatically extracted for each supine and prone surface, employing the colon geometry. The two colon surfaces are then divided into several segments using the flexures, and each segment is cut along a taenia coli and conformally flattened to the rectangular domain using holomorphic differentials. The mean curvature is color encoded as texture images, from which feature points are automatically detected using graph cut segmentation, mathematic morphological operations, and principal component analysis. Corresponding feature points are found between supine and prone and are used to adjust the conformal flattening to be quasi-conformal, such that the features become aligned. We present multiple methods of visualizing our results, including 2D flattened rendering, corresponding 3D endoluminal views, and rendering of distortion measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our registration method by illustrating matched views on both the 2D flattened colon images and in the 3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view. We analytically evaluate the correctness of the results by measuring the distance between features on the registered colons."

CD011126,0,23165609,0,Effect of exercise training combined with isoflavone supplementation on bone and lipids in postmenopausal women: a randomized clinical trial.,"We determined the effects of 2 years of exercise training and soy isoflavone supplementation on bone mass and lipids in postmenopausal women provided with calcium and vitamin D. Women were randomized to four groups: exercise training (Ex); isoflavone supplementation (Iso: 165 mg/d [105 mg/d aglycone equivalent]); combined Ex and Iso (ExIso); and placebo (control). Exercise included resistance training (2 days/week) and walking (4 days/week). Our primary outcomes were lumbar spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD). Secondary outcomes included hip geometry, tibia and radius speed of sound (SOS), dynamic balance (6 m backward tandem walking), blood lipids, mammography, and endometrial thickness. A total of 351 women (Ex = 86, Iso = 90, ExIso = 87, control = 88) were randomized, with 298 analyzed at 2 years (Ex = 77, Iso = 76, ExIso = 72, control = 73). There was a significant interaction for total hip BMD (p < 0.001) such that ExIso had a greater rate of decrease (absolute change [95% confidence interval] = -0.018 [-0.024, -0.012] g/cm(2) ) than either the Ex or Iso groups alone (-0.005 [-0.01, 0.001] and -0.005 [-0.011, 0.001] g/cm(2) , respectively). There were no differences between groups for changes in lumbar spine BMD and minimal significant changes in hip geometric properties and bone SOS. Exercise groups improved dynamic balance as measured by a decrease in backward tandem walking time over 6 m (p = 0.017). Isoflavone groups decreased low density lipoproteins (Iso: -0.20 [-0.37, -0.02] mmol/L; ExIso: -0.23 [-0.40, -0.06] mmol/L; p = 0.003) compared to non-isoflavone groups (Ex: 0.01 [-0.16, 0.18] mmol/L; control: -0.09 [-0.27, 0.08] mmol/L) and had lower adverse reports of menopausal symptoms (14% versus 33%; p = 0.01) compared to non-isoflavone groups. Isoflavone supplementation did not increase endometrial thickness or abnormal mammograms. We conclude exercise training and isoflavone supplementation maintain hip BMD compared to control, but these two interventions interfere with each other when combined. Isoflavone supplementation decreased LDL and adverse events related to menopausal symptoms."

A precursor lesion, while thought by many to exist, has so far not been successfully identified. While CA-125 is a useful test for the follow-up of patients with established ovarian cancer, it has not led to earlier detection when used alone as a marker. Similarly, ultrasound, although a sensitive test, is not sufficiently specific to be utilized for screening. The combination of CA-125 and ultrasound is currently being studied and may ultimately prove to be an effective screening method for postmenopausal and high-risk women. Research is also under way to identify markers that have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be utilized in the screening of asymptomatic women; the hope is to ultimately develop a panel of markers for early detection."

Left ventricular thrombus mimicking primary cardiac tumor with recurrent systemic embolism has not been previously reported. In this report we describe a 39 year-old man admitted to hospital presenting with left hemiparesis and a peripheral embolism. He had no history of thrombotic events. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large, polypoid and mobile mass (4.0 x 1.2 cm) attached to the apex of the left ventricle, highly suggestive of primary cardiac tumor. The patient subsequently underwent open heart surgery. The histological examination showed an older thrombus and a fresh thrombus. Post-operative laboratory tests showed lupus anticoagulant activity, confirming the primary APS diagnosis. The patient initiated treatment with oral anticoagulation (INR levels between 2 and 3) and was discharged 29 days after surgery. At ten month follow-up, he was symptom-free with long-term anticoagulation therapy. No evidence of intracardiac mass recurrence on two-dimensional echocardiography was seen. Intracardiac thrombus has been rarely reported as a complication of primary APS.

CD011126,0,16033059,0,"Evaluation of CA125, physical and radiological findings in follow-up of ovarian cancer patients.","The majority of ovarian cancer patients will suffer from intraabdominal relapse within the first five years after surgery. Today various diagnostic tools, including ultrasound or CT, are available to detect an ovarian cancer recurrence. Radiological examinations at regular time-intervals may lead to the detection of tumor relapse, however these procedures have limited sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, imaging procedures are costly. CA125 is a tumor marker with high sensitivity in ovarian cancer patients. Tumor marker determination is a simple, reproducible technique, and may therefore be useful in routine follow-up in ovarian cancer patients, supplemented with additional imaging procedures. In a retrospective analysis of 58 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, the sensitivity of clinical examination and tumor marker analysis was compared to radiological findings. Physical interview and physical examination were performed for all patients. CA125 levels were determined in 54 out of 58 patients at the time of diagnosis of recurrence. Forty-seven out of 58 patients received a vaginal ultrasound and 42 were examined by CT scan. In 45 out of 54 (83%) patients, CA 125 was elevated at the time of recurrence. In 45 out of the 58 (78%) patients, a tumor was detected by physical examination. Forty-two out of the 58 patients had CT scans. Pathological findings were seen in 33 out of these patients (80%) Ultrasound revealed tumor recurrence in 33 out of 47 patients (70%). By a follow-up based on physical examination and CA125 determination, 53 out of 54 (98%) patients with recurrences could be identified.

CD011126,0,21963284,0,"Image guided, adaptive, accelerated, high dose brachytherapy as model for advanced small volume radiotherapy.","Brachytherapy has consistently provided a very conformal radiation therapy modality. Over the last two decades this has been associated with significant improvements in imaging for brachytherapy applications (prostate, gynecology), resulting in many positive advances in treatment planning, application techniques and clinical outcome. This is emphasized by the increased use of brachytherapy in Europe with gynecology as continuous basis and prostate and breast as more recently growing fields. Image guidance enables exact knowledge of the applicator together with improved visualization of tumor and target volumes as well as of organs at risk providing the basis for very individualized 3D and 4D treatment planning. In this commentary the most important recent developments in prostate, gynecological and breast brachytherapy are reviewed, with a focus on European recent and current research aiming at the definition of areas for important future research. Moreover the positive impact of GEC-ESTRO recommendations and the highlights of brachytherapy physics are discussed what altogether presents a full overview of modern image guided brachytherapy. An overview is finally provided on past and current international brachytherapy publications focusing on ""Radiotherapy and Oncology"". These data show tremendous increase in almost all research areas over the last three decades strongly influenced recently by translational research in regard to imaging and technology. In order to provide high level clinical evidence for future brachytherapy practice the strong need for comprehensive prospective clinical research addressing brachytherapy issues is high-lighted."
CD011126,0,22521776,0,Imaging in infections of the left iliac fossa.,"The main organs in the left iliac fossa are the descending colon, sigmoid colon and, in women, internal reproductive organs. An infection of the left iliac fossa must lead the clinician firstly to suspect diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon in older patients and salpingitis in women of childbearing age. Other less common aetiologies are possible (inflammatory or infectious colitis, epiploic appendagitis, abscess of the psoas, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, etc.). Sonography as a first-line investigation may lead to diagnosis (especially in gynaecological disease), but a CT scan with intravenous injection of an iodine-containing contrast medium will allow for a full assessment of disease spread, and complications of sigmoid colitis or its differential diagnoses (abscess, fistula, perforation) to be investigated.

CD011126,0,20088402,0,[Sacrococcygeal teratoma in foetus--case report].,"Sacrococcygeal teratoma develops from all three germinal layers (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm). Sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCT) are the most common neoplasms in the fetus and newborns, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 40,000. Female to male ratio is 3:1. Perinatal mortality rate among fetuses with prenatally diagnosed SCT is high, mainly due to cardiac failure. According to Polish Gynecology Society Recommendation, the main aim of intrauterine intervention or pharmacological treatment in case of prenatally diagnosed SCT is to prevent development of severe fetal cardiac failure. Fetal cardiac failure is one of the most important prognostic factors in surveillance of fetus and newborns with SCT. The following article describes a case report of a 34-year-old pregnant woman, 23 weeks of gestation, with a diagnosis of fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma. Each pregnant woman with suspicion of neoplasm in fetus should be referred to tertiary center of perinatal care to gain access to specific diagnostic methods and medical care of many specialists, such as obstetricians, neonatologists, general practitioners and infant surgeons.

Preprocedural US may help identify relative contraindications for UAE, whereas postprocedural US can help determine the quality and quantity of fibroid involution and help identify any complications associated with the procedure. The consulting radiologist should be familiar with certain typical postprocedural US findings, which might otherwise be improperly interpreted, leading to unnecessary intervention. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computed tomography will frequently provide the most accurate information in UAE patients with certain pathologic conditions, and early study results suggest that MR imaging may be helpful in predicting treatment response. Nevertheless, US is a readily available first-line imaging modality and a well-accepted method for both pre- and postprocedural evaluation of patients who undergo UAE. A proper understanding of the US findings in this patient population allows objective determination of treatment response and detection of most of the commonly recognized complications that are associated with UAE."

Here, we report a case of spontaneous uterine rupture that occurred in the early third trimester in a pregnant woman who had previously undergone laparoscopic removal of the right fallopian tube and interstitial portion for treatment of interstitial pregnancy. The patient presented with sudden onset of abdominal pain at 26 weeks of gestation. Detailed ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging led to diagnosis of uterine rupture. In emergency laparotomy, the fetus was delivered by Cesarean section, the placenta and membranes were removed, and the uterus was preserved with closure of the rupture and wound. This case highlights the importance of close follow-up of a pregnant patient who has previously had a uterine incision. The case also raises the question of whether the prevalence of uterine rupture may increase as more patients are treated with laparoscopic surgery of the uterus."

CD011126,0,19418349,0,Three-dimensional reconstruction of the uterine vascular supply through vascular casting and thin slice computed tomography scanning.,"It was the objective of this study to construct a model of the uterine vascular supply through vascular casting and thin slice computed tomography scanning. This will provide a teaching aide for the understanding of uterine artery embolization (UAE) procedures, as well as normal uterine and ovarian arterial anatomy. Using 20% chlorinated poly vinyl chloride, we infused and cast a set of a normal uterus, vagina and bilateral adnexa through the uterine artery and ovarian artery. After thin slice CT scanning, we obtained the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction by maximum intensity projection (MIP) and surface-shaded display (SSD), and then observed its figure and characteristics. A model of the uterine vascular supply can be successfully reconstructed by vascular casting and thin slice CT scanning. The 3D reconstruction offers a clear view of the course of the uterine artery and its blood supply distribution. It has two major branches: The intramuscular uterine branch and the cervicovaginal branch (1). Blood supply is generally unilateral, with communicating branches between the two sides and possible anastomoses between the arterial blood supply of the uterus and the ovaries. The major blood supply of the cervix comes from the cervicovaginal branch of the uterine artery, while the vaginal arterial supply derives directly from the internal iliac artery. The CT technique allows real-time 360 degrees rotation and changes in model for in-depth study of the vascular network and its adjacent tissues. It is possible to construct an in vitro uterine arterial network by vascular casting and CT scanning, which can provide unique insight into the female genitourinary system arterial network. Based on this, we can create reconstructions as well as models for different diseases such as leiomyomata, adenomyosis, and endometrial cancer. These models will provide morphological evidence to the interventional therapy and UAE teaching in Obstetrics and Gynecology."

CD011126,0,15738414,0,Architecture of the bacteriophage T4 primosome: electron microscopy studies of helicase (gp41) and primase (gp61).,"Replication of DNA requires helicase and primase activities as part of a primosome assembly. In bacteriophage T4, helicase and primase are separate polypeptides for which little structural information is available and whose mechanism of association within the primosome is not yet understood. Three-dimensional structural information is provided here by means of reconstructions from electron microscopic images. Structures have been calculated for complexes of each of these proteins with ssDNA in the presence of MgATPgammaS. Both the helicase (gp41) and primase (gp61) complexes are asymmetric hexagonal rings. The gp41 structure suggests two distinct forms that have been termed ""open"" and ""closed."" The gp61 structure is clearly a six-membered ring, which may be a trimer of dimers or a traditional hexamer of monomers. This structure provides conclusive evidence for an oligomeric primase-to-ssDNA stoichiometry of 6:1."
CD011126,0,18373800,0,Imaging of adenomyomatosis of the gall bladder.,"Adenomyomatosis is a relatively common abnormality of the gall bladder, with a reported incidence of between 2.8 and 5%. Although mainly confined to the adult study group, a number of cases have been reported in the paediatric study group. It is characterized pathologically by excessive proliferation of the surface epithelium and hypertrophy of the muscularis propria of the gall bladder wall, with invagination of the mucosa into the thickened muscularis forming the so-called 'Rokitansky-Aschoff' sinuses. The condition is usually asymptomatic and is often diagnosed as an incidental finding on abdominal imaging. The radiological diagnosis is largely dependent on the visualization of the characteristic Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. As the condition is usually asymptomatic, the importance of making a correct diagnosis is to prevent misinterpretation of other gall bladder conditions such as gall bladder cancer, leading to incorrect treatment. In the past, oral cholecystography was the main imaging method used to make this diagnosis. In most institutions, oral cholecystography is no longer carried out, and the diagnosis is now more commonly seen on cross-sectional imaging. In this review article, we describe the manifestations of adenomyomatosis on the various imaging methods, with an emphasis on more modern techniques such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. A brief section on oral cholecystography to aid readers familiar with this technique in understanding the comparable imaging features on more modern imaging techniques is included."

Primary and secondary DVT prevalence among hospitalised patients was 0.453%, a significant rise from reported rates of 0.079% and 0.158% in 1989-1990 and 1996-1997, respectively. Malignancies and orthopaedic surgery were the most common risk factors for DVT. Further comparisons with the two earlier Singaporean studies showed no changes in the gender and ethnic background of patients but a higher proportion of elderly patients (>80 years) was recorded in the current study (11.7% vs. 7.0%, p = 0.04). Statistically significant increases were found in all medical and surgical disciplines except among obstetrics and gynaecology patients. Orthopaedic patients had the highest increase in DVT rates between the 1989-1990 and 2002-2003 periods (0.082% vs. 0.96%, p<0.01). Doppler ultrasound scans performed increased from approximately one per 100 admissions in 1996-1997 to one per 30 admissions in 2002-2003. The significant increase in period prevalence of DVT among hospitalised patients in Singapore could be accounted by methodologic differences between comparative studies, an increase in proportion of elderly patients and most importantly, a possible shift in perception of the importance of VTE among Asians, resulting in a higher index of suspicion and lower threshold for performing diagnostic tests."

CD011126,0,17160495,0,Perceptive errors in CT colonography.,"Published results to date have indicated a good per patient sensitivity of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) for colorectal cancer and for polyps measuring 10 mm or more together with a very good specificity. Sensitivity and specificity for polyps in the range of 6-10 mm are moderate. These results, however, can be achieved only with meticulous attention to technique including adequate colonic distention, and acquisition of supine and prone thin-section computed tomographic (CT) images. Moreover, there is a significant learning curve involved in the interpretation of CTC studies, with performance statistics improving with operator experience. Radiologists must be comfortable in reporting directly from workstation monitors and have access to and be familiar with software for multiplanar and endoluminal reconstructions. In addition to maximize polyp detection and minimize false positive results, reporting radiologists must have a working knowledge of normal colorectal anatomy and pathology on CTC and be familiar with potential pitfalls in interpretation. Besides the description of several possible causes for perceptive errors, also a literature search of perceptive errors in CTC is included in this paper."

Despite the improvement, the overall system is not optimal. CAD annotations on true lesions are incorrectly dismissed, and false positives are misinterpreted as true polyps. Here, we conduct an observer performance study utilizing distributed human intelligence in the form of anonymous knowledge workers (KWs) to investigate human performance in classifying polyp candidates under different presentation strategies. We evaluated 600 polyp candidates from 50 patients, each case having at least one polyp ≥6 mm, from a large database of CTC studies. Each polyp candidate was labeled independently as a true or false polyp by 20 KWs and an expert radiologist. We asked each labeler to determine whether the candidate was a true polyp after looking at a single 3D-rendered image of the candidate and after watching a video fly-around of the candidate. We found that distributed human intelligence improved significantly when presented with the additional information in the video fly-around. We noted that performance degraded with increasing interpretation time and increasing difficulty, but distributed human intelligence performed better than our CAD classifier for ""easy"" and ""moderate"" polyp candidates. Further, we observed numerous parallels between the expert radiologist and the KWs. Both showed similar improvement in classification moving from single-image to video interpretation. Additionally, difficulty estimates obtained from the KWs using an expectation maximization algorithm correlated well with the difficulty rating assigned by the expert radiologist. Our results suggest that distributed human intelligence is a powerful tool that will aid in the development of CAD for CTC."
CD011126,0,22168667,0,Study protocol subacromial impingement syndrome: the identification of pathophysiologic mechanisms (SISTIM).,"The subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is the most common diagnosed disorder of the shoulder in primary health care, but its aetiology is unclear. Conservative treatment regimes focus at reduction of subacromial inflammatory reactions or pathologic scapulohumeral motion patterns (intrinsic aetiology). Long-lasting symptoms are often treated with surgery, which is focused at enlarging the subacromial space by resection of the anterior part of the acromion (based on extrinsic aetiology). Despite that acromionplasty is in the top-10 of orthopaedic surgical procedures, there is no consensus on its indications and reported results are variable (successful in 48-90%). We hypothesize that the aetiology of SIS, i.e. an increase in subacromial pressure or decrease of subacromial space, is multi-factorial. SIS can be the consequence of pathologic scapulohumeral motion patterns leading to humerus cranialisation, anatomical variations of the scapula and the humerus (e.g. hooked acromion), a subacromial inflammatory reaction (e.g. due to overuse or micro-trauma), or adjoining pathology (e.g. osteoarthritis in the acromion-clavicular-joint with subacromial osteophytes).We believe patients should be treated according to their predominant etiological mechanism(s). Therefore, the objective of our study is to identify and discriminate etiological mechanisms occurring in SIS patients, in order to develop tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
CD011126,0,23761135,0,Regression analysis for current status data using the EM algorithm.,"We propose new expectation-maximization algorithms to analyze current status data under two popular semiparametric regression models: the proportional hazards (PH) model and the proportional odds (PO) model. Monotone splines are used to model the baseline cumulative hazard function in the PH model and the baseline odds function in the PO model. The proposed algorithms are derived by exploiting a data augmentation based on Poisson latent variables. Unlike previous regression work with current status data, our PH and PO model fitting methods are fast, flexible, easy to implement, and provide variance estimates in closed form. These techniques are evaluated using simulation and are illustrated using uterine fibroid data from a prospective cohort study on early pregnancy."

CD011126,0,14513878,0,The risk of functional ovarian hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary syndrome in patients with hyperandrogenism.,"To describe the presence of dysregulations in steroid biosynthesis and the risk of functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (FOH) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-like development in children with hyperandrogenism, 28 girls were studied. Adrenal steroidogenic profile was defined by basal and ACTH-stimulated levels of 17OHP, cortisol, DHEAS and androstenedione, and delta precursor/delta product ratios. Ovarian hyperandrogenism was defined by 17OHP response to LHRH stimulation, and pelvic ultrasonography (US) was performed to evaluate ovarian morphology. Basal and ACTH-stimulated hormonal results revealed non-classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency-like status in one patient (3.6%), and 21-hydroxylase deficiency heterozygote carrier-like state in four patients (14.3%), while the other 23 patients (82.1%) had functional adrenal hyperandrogenism (FAH). Among these patients with FAH, 47.83% had FOH; when these patients were evaluated by pelvic US, 30.4% had morphological changes which were not concordant with their age. We suggest that even mild forms of hyperandrogenism must be considered seriously and dysregulations of the steroidogenic pathway and ovarian abnormalities must be evaluated carefully to determine the risk of FOH/PCOS."

The sonographic findings were compared and correlated with the findings of histopathology. TAS and TVS revealed 20(37.7%) & 20(37.7%) had leiomyoma, 12(22.6%) & 14(26.4%) had Ca cervix, 6(11.3%) & 7(13.2%) had endometrial carcinoma, 1(1.9%) & 1(1.9%) had hydatidiform mole respectively. TAS revealed 5(9.4%) had thickened endometrium, and no detectable mass were detected in 9(17.0%) cases. TVS revealed polyp in 7(13.2%), and no detectable mass were detected in 4(7.5%) cases. Histopathologically confirmed leiomyoma were in 18(34.0%) cases, Ca cervix in 14(26.4%), endometrial carcinoma in 6(11.3%), adenomyosis in 1(1.9%), polyp in 7(13.2%), chronic cervicitis in 2(3.8%), hydatidiform mole in 1(1.9%) and no detectable mass were detected in 4(7.5%) cases. Sensitivity of TAS and TVS to diagnose uterine mass were 83.7% and 95.9%, specificity 25.0% and 50.0%, positive predictive value 93.2% and 95.9%, negative predictive value 11.1% and 50.0% and accuracy 79.2% and 92.5% respectively. Sensitivity of TAS & TVS to diagnose leiomyoma was 88.9% & 94.9%, specificity 88.6% & 91.4%, positive predictive value 80.0% & 85.0%, negative predictive value 93.9% & 97.0%, and accuracy 88.7% & 92.5% respectively. Sensitivity of TAS & TVS to diagnose Ca cervix were 57.1% & 78.6%, specificity 89.7% & 92.3%, positive predictive value 66.9% & 78.6%, negative predictive value 85.4% & 92.3%, and accuracy 81.1% & 88.7% respectively. So, uterine mass can be evaluated more accurately by TVS than TAS."

Either their organ of origin is uncertain or it is unclear whether their nature is benign or malignant. MR imaging of the sonographically indeterminate adnexal mass can resolve most of these uncertainties. Most indeterminate masses result from common benign conditions and women with such masses can avoid unnecessary or inappropriate surgery. For the minority of women whose masses are malignant, use of MR imaging rather than a 'wait and watch' strategy of repeat ultrasound (US) results in a more timely diagnosis. There are simple diagnostic steps in the MR imaging assessment which direct an algorithmic and problem-solving approach based on signal characteristics and morphology. MR imaging should provide a more timely diagnosis and, thereby, guide the management of the patient with reduced costs of investigation and treatment."

CD011126,0,20876913,0,Clostridium perfringens septicaemia with massive intravascular haemolysis: a case report and review of the literature.,"We describe the case of a 74-year-old man with cholangitis, complicated by Clostridium perfringens septicaemia and massive intravascular haemolysis. Clostridium perfringens septicaemia is a rare but well-known cause of massive intravascular haemolysis. Here we review 40 similar cases published since 1990. Most cases involve immunocompromised patients with underlying haematological disorder (22.5%), pancreatic or gastric cancer (12.5%) and÷or diabetes (30.0%). Focus of infection is mostly hepatobiliary (45.0%), intestinal or gynaecological after invasive procedure. Eighty percent of reviewed cases did not survive; the median time between admission and death was only eight hours. If an attempt was made to remove the focus of infection (i.e. by drainage of liver abscess, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy or ERCP), this proved to be a strong prognostic indicator of survival. However, in many of the cases the patient had already gone into shock or died before a diagnosis could be made. In severely ill patients with fever and haemolysis on the emergency department Clostridium perfringens septicaemia should always be considered, since early antibiotic treatment and if possible removal of the focus of infection can rescue patients from an otherwise fatal outcome."

CD011126,0,17895896,0,High incidence of silent venous thromboembolism before treatment in ovarian cancer.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) often occurs after surgery and rarely occurs even before surgery in patients with ovarian cancer. It is well known that levels of plasma D-dimer (DD) before treatment in most ovarian cancer patients are increased. This study therefore examined whether increased levels of DD are associated with presence of VTE before treatment of ovarian cancer. Between November 2004 and March 2007, DD levels prior to initial treatment were measured in 72 consecutive patients with presumed epithelial ovarian cancer (final diagnosis: epithelial ovarian cancer, n=60; and epithelial ovarian borderline malignancy, n=12). Venous ultrasound imaging (VUI) of the lower extremity was conducted for all patients except for two patients in whom DVT was detected by pelvic computed tomography (CT). When DVT was found, pulmonary scintigraphy was subsequently performed to ascertain presence of PTE. D-dimer levels were above the cut-off value (0.5 microg ml(-1)) in 65 of 72 patients (90.2%). Venous ultrasound imaging or CT revealed DVT in 18 of 72 patients (25.0%) and pulmonary scintigraphy found PTE in 8 patients (11.1%). All patients with VTE were asymptomatic when VTE was found. D-dimer levels were associated with incidence of VTE (0-1.4 microg ml(-1); 0 of 26 (0%), 1.5-7.4 microg ml(-1); 9 of 30 (30%) and > or =7.5 microg ml(-1); 9 of 16 (56.3%), P for trend=0.0003). However, even if 1.5 microg ml(-1) was used as a cut-off value, this had low specificity and positive predictive value (47.2, 38.3%), though it had high sensitivity and negative predictive value (100, 100%). Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with DD level > or =1.5 microg ml(-1) should be examined using VUI to detect silent DVT. Patients with VTE underwent preventive managements including anticoagulant therapy before initial treatment, chemotherapy or surgery, and after surgery. There was no clinical onset of postoperative VTE in all 72 patients. Measurement of DD levels and subsequent ultrasonography revealed that silent or subclinical VTE frequently occurs before surgery in ovarian cancer. The usefulness of preoperative assessment of VTE needs further confirmation in randomised controlled trials."
CD011126,0,25926909,0,Ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor with heterologous elements of gastrointestinal type associated with elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level: an unusual case and literature review.,"Here we describe the case of a 19-year-old woman with a poorly differentiated ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor and an elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level. The patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain and bloating. Physical examination, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right ovarian tumor that was histopathologically diagnosed as a poorly differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor with heterologous elements. Her alpha-fetoprotein serum level was undetectable after tumor resection. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are rare sex cord-stromal tumors that account for 0.5% of all ovarian neoplasms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors tend to be unilateral and occur in women under 30 years of age. Although they are the most common virilizing tumor of the ovary, about 60% are endocrine-inactive tumors. Elevated serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein are rarely associated with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, with only approximately 30 such cases previously reported in the literature. The differential diagnosis should include common alpha-fetoprotein-producing ovarian entities such as germ cell tumors, as well as other non-germ cell tumors that have been rarely reported to produce this tumor marker."
CD011126,0,25620161,0,Ultrasound use in gynecologic brachytherapy: Time to focus the beam.,"There is wide disparity in the practice of brachytherapy for cervical cancer around the world. Although select well-resourced centers advocate use of MRI for all insertions, planar X-ray imaging remains the most commonly used imaging modality to assess intracavitary implants, particularly where the burden of cervical cancer is high. Incorporating soft tissue imaging into brachytherapy programs has been shown to improve the technical accuracy of implants, which in turn has led to improved local control and decreased toxicity. These improvements have a positive effect on the quality of life of patients undergoing brachytherapy for cervical cancer. Finding an accessible soft tissue imaging modality is essential to enable these improvements to be available to all patients. A modality that has good soft tissue imaging capabilities, is widely available, portable, and economical, is needed. Ultrasound fulfils these requirements and offers the potential of soft tissue image guidance to a much wider brachytherapy community. Although use of ultrasound is the standard of care in brachytherapy for prostate cancer, it only seems to have limited uptake in gynecologic brachytherapy. This article reviews the role of ultrasound in gynecologic brachytherapy and highlights the potential applications for use in brachytherapy for cervical cancer."

CD011126,0,21401631,0,Ultrasonographic staging: a new staging system for deep endometriosis.,"Modern imaging techniques allow for the noninvasive diagnosis of endometriosis. Preoperative staging of pelvic endometriosis helps the gynecologist plan therapy and offer a prognosis to patients. The challenge of creating a satisfactory classification of endometriosis remains. The ability of the current classification schemes to predict pregnancy outcome, or aid in the management of pelvic pain, is recognized to be inadequate. The study of deeply infiltrating endometriosis and adenomyosis is greatly hampered by a lack of clear terminology and the absence of a consensus classification of the lesions. A reviewed consensus classification of endometriosis in general, with a more detailed consideration on deep endometriosis, is urgently required. We suggest a new staging system for deep, infiltrating endometriosis based on ultrasonographic findings. Prospective data collection and review in large centers may provide a larger clinical base from which to derive empirical point scores and breakpoints in the classification scheme."
CD011126,0,17945611,0,A biomechanical model of the pelvic cavity: first steps.,"The surgical treatments of genital prolapsus are still empirical and poorly valued. We plan to achieve a method for the objective assessment of the troubles of the pelvic statics and of the various surgical strategies. The methodology considers 3 axes: building a 3D mechanical model of the pelvic cavity, mechanical characterization of the concerned organic tissues, in-vivo measurement of the intravaginal pressures. The MRI images are acquired according 3 orientations (sagittal, axial and coronal); the organs (bladder, vagina and rectum) are manually outlined and their 3D shape is then rebuilt. Uniaxial tensile tests are initially developed on animal samples before being applied to peroperative human samples. In-vivo measurements of the intravaginal pressures are made thanks to a set of 8 strain gauges specially designed. We show results obtained on 2 patients with a different rank of prolapsus. These first steps will be continued by a more detailed geometry of the organs and a characterization of healthy tissues. Dynamic behaviour of the mechanical stresses will also be investigated."

CD011126,0,16482731,0,Ovarian cancer screening: a look at the evidence.,"In 2005, more than 22,000 American women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 16,000 women died from the disease. The five-year relative survival rate for stage III and IV disease is 31%, and the five-year relative survival rate for stage I is 95%. Early diagnosis should lower the fatality rate. Unfortunately, early diagnosis is difficult because of the physically inaccessible location of the ovaries, the lack of specific symptoms in early disease, and the limited understanding of ovarian oncogenesis. Screening tests for ovarian cancer need high sensitivity and specificity to be useful because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed ovarian cancer. Because currently available screening tests do not achieve high levels of sensitivity and specificity, screening is not recommended for the general population. The theoretical advantage of screening is much higher for women at high risk (such as those with a strong family history of ovarian cancer and those with BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations). However, even for women at high risk, no prospective studies have shown benefits of screening. The public health challenge is that 90% of ovarian cancer occurs in women who are not in an identifiable high-risk group, and most women are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease. Currently available tests (CA-125, transvaginal ultrasound, or a combination of both) lack the sensitivity and specificity to be useful in screening the general population. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing whether new tumor markers, including those generated by proteomic and genomic studies, will prove useful."
CD011126,0,17623538,0,Ultrasound and the receptivity of the endometrium.,"Ultrasound imaging can be used to assess the endometrium in a number of ways. In particular, time-lapse video recordings can show that the lining of the uterus undergoes rhythmical contractions that vary in strength and intensity throughout the ovarian cycle. These contractions appear to assist in sperm transport at the time of ovulation, but can decrease the chances of a fertilized egg implanting in the uterus if they persist later in the cycle. They are also the cause of ectopic pregnancies occurring in IVF treatment cycles. In order to reduce these uterine contractions and therefore increase the chances of a successful uterine pregnancy, IVF treatment cycles should incorporate minimal stimulation so as to make them as close to natural cycles as possible."

CD011126,0,25329139,0,The relationship between serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels and the follicular arrest for women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher levels of serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) are associated with the ovarian follicular arrest in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This prospective study compared AMH levels between serum and dominant follicular fluid (FF) in ovulatory polycystic ovary (PCO) women and anovulatory (menstrual cycle ≥60 days.) PCOS women. All 102 women provided a baseline hormone profile and underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). The anovulatory PCO women had a similar body mass index (BMI), antral follicle count (AFC), and baseline serum AMH levels as the ovulatory PCO women except that their median luteinizing hormone (LH; 10.0 mIU/ml), testosterone (T) (0.61 ng/l), and androstenedione (A) (3.47 ng/l) levels were significantly higher than ovulatory PCO women (4.9 mIU/m; 0.43 ng/l and 2.09 ng/l, respectively). The ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation during COH including serum AMH on the day of HCG administration and dominant FF AMH at 36 hours after HCG administration, total follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) dose administrated, peak E2, (estrogen) levels and number of occytes retrieved were all similar between women with anovulatory and ovulatory PCO. Using multiple regression analysis it was found that an important independent determinant affecting AMH was AFC, as opposed to LH and T. Logistic regression analysis showed that the two most important factors affecting ovulation were serum LH and T, whereas serum AMH and AFC were not selected for inclusion in the model. The reduction in AMH during COH occurs as a consequence of dominant follicles with a corresponding reduction in small antral follicle number. Elevated serum AMH levels in PCO women seem to be related only to follicular excess and not follicular arrest."

Physical examination and transrectal ultra-sonography showed a 7.0 cm right seminal vesicle cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the diagnosis of Zinner's syndrome. Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia was present at the two seminal analyses. Symptomatic improvement was achieved with conservative measures. Actually, the patient is still on a follow-up programme. The diagnosis is usually established at the age of increased sexual activity. Patients may be asymptomatic or present pain, irritative urinary or ejaculatory symptoms and infertility. MRI has proved to be the best imaging examination. Treatment should be adapted to symptoms, surveillance being the best option in the absence of clinical manifestations. Surgical approach may be adequate when conservative measures prove ineffective. Zinner's syndrome should be suspected if a male young patient presents with unilateral renal agenesis and pelvic complaints and has a supraprostatic mass on digital rectal examination.

Fifty-two CT colonography patient data-sets (37 patients: 55 endoscopically confirmed polyps > or =0.5 cm, seven cancers; 15 patients: no abnormalities) were retrospectively reviewed by four radiologists (two expert, two nonexpert). After primary data evaluation, a second reading augmented with findings of CAD (polyp-enhanced view, Siemens) was performed. Sensitivities and reading time were calculated for each reader without CAD and supported by CAD findings. The sensitivity of expert readers was 91% each, and of nonexpert readers, 76% and 75%, respectively, for polyp detection. CAD increased the sensitivity of expert readers to 96% (P = 0.25) and 93% (P = 1), and that of nonexpert readers to 91% (P = 0.008) and 95% (P = 0.001), respectively. All four readers diagnosed 100% of cancers, but CAD alone only 43%. CAD increased reading time by 2.1 min (mean).

CD011126,0,14968060,0,[Imaging features of endometriosis].,"Deep pelvic endometriosis is responsible of a painful syndrome dominated by deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain that recur according to the menstrual cycle. The semiology is directly correlated with the location of the lesions but is not specific. It is essential to investigate (clinically and with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) these deep endometriosis lesions and to draw up a precise map, which is the only way to be sure that surgical excisions will be complete. For the diagnosis of deep endometriosis, MRI is more sensitive and specific than endovaginal ultrasonography. Bowel and utero-sacral ligament lesions are often underestimated by clinical examination and ultrasonography. The MR diagnosis of these deep lesions is also difficult and require adapted sequences but may vary following experience of the radiologist. Preoperative endorectal ultrasonography or MRI are reliable techniques to visualize perirectal endometriomas and to assess rectal wall involvement. Surgical management can be based on preoperative imaging diagnosis, the Bladder and ureteral lesions are also underestimated. Renal ultrasonography must be performed in women affected by severe deeply infiltrating endometriosis. MRI does not improve sensitivity nor specificity of the radiologic diagnosis of ovarian endometriomas. Nevertheless, MRI is a reliable technique to visualize deeply infiltrating endometriosis lesions associated with ovarian endometriomas."
CD011126,0,14968064,0,"[New concepts on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of adenomyosis].","Adenomyosis is a relatively frequent disease, difficult to diagnose and which pathophysiology remains unknown. The treatment for the women which want to conserve or improve their fertility remains not well defined. Endovaginal ultrasonography seems to be as effective as MRI for the diagnosis of adenomyosis. Gn-RH agonist decreases symptoms and uterine volume; however, the symptoms reappear after discontinuation of agonist therapy, and side effects limit their prolonged use. Progestérone receptor modulators, anti-progestative and danazol or levonorgestrel-releasing intra-uterine system have been used as therapeutic modalities for adenomyosis, but the lack of controlled studies make their efficacy difficult to quantify. Some women with superficial adenomyosis may theoretically benefit from hysteroscopic myometrial or endometrial resection, but these procedures would be limited to women not wishing to conceive. Laparoscopic myometrial electrocoagulation or excision has proven to be effective but pregnancy following these techniques poses special problems, particularly the increased risk of uterine rupture. Transvaginal ultrasonography can successfully diagnose adenomyosis. Medical and conservative surgical treatments are already available."
CD011126,0,19487066,0,Ovarian reserve screening in infertility: practical applications and theoretical directions for research.,"The concept of ovarian reserve describes the natural oocyte endowment and is closely associated with female age, which is the single most important factor influencing reproductive outcome. Fertility potential first declines after the age of 30 and moves downward rapidly thereafter, essentially reaching zero by the mid-40s. Conceptions beyond this age are exceedingly rare, unless oocytes obtained from a younger donor are utilised. How best to estimate ovarian reserve clinically remains controversial. Passive assessments of ovarian reserve include measurement of serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), oestradiol (E(2)), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), and inhibin-B. Ultrasound determination of antral follicle count (AFC), ovarian vascularity and ovarian volume also can have a role. The clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT), exogenous FSH ovarian reserve test (EFORT), and GnRH-agonist stimulation test (GAST) are provocative methods that have been used to assess ovarian reserve. Importantly, a patient's prior response to gonadotropins also provides highly valuable information about ovarian function. Regarding prediction of reproductive outcome, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) experience at our centres and elsewhere has shown that some assessments of ovarian reserve perform better than others. In this report, these tests are discussed and compared; we also present practical strategies to organise screening as presently used at our institutions. Experimental challenges to the long-held tenet of irreversible ovarian ageing are also introduced and explored. While pregnancy rates after IVF are influenced by multiple (non-ovarian) factors including in vitro laboratory conditions, semen parameters, psychological stress and technique of embryo transfer, predicting response to gonadotropin treatment nevertheless remains an important aim in the evaluation of the couple struggling with infertility."

Polyps are modeled using gray level intensity profiles and extended Gaussian images. Spherical harmonic decompositions ensure an easy comparison between a polyp candidate and a set of polypoid models, found in a previously built database. The detection sensitivity and specificity values are evaluated at different dose levels. Starting from the original raw-data (acquired at 55mAs), 5 patient datasets (prone and supine scans) are reconstructed at different dose levels (down to 5mAs), using different kernel filters and slice increments. Although the image quality decreases when lowering the acquisition mAs, all polyps above 6mm are successfully detected even at 15 mAs.

CD011126,0,25608252,0,Adnexal masses in the premenopausal patient.,"Practitioners may frequently encounter adnexal masses in premenopausal women. Adnexal masses can represent a wide variety of etiologies, and therefore they can represent a diagnostic dilemma. When an adnexal mass is found the initial work up must focus on identifying acute pathology followed by determining the risk of a malignancy. Pelvic ultrasound remains the mainstay for evaluation of adnexal masses in premenopausal patients. If ultrasounds findings are indeterminate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the next imaging modality of choice. The evaluation for malignancy should include serum marker screening. Aspiration of adnexal masses is generally avoided, due to the lack of therapeutic benefit and risk of seeding a tumor. When ultrasound findings are suggestive of benign disease, conservative management, including repeat imaging, should be considered. If the clinical suspicion for malignancy is high referral to a gynecologic oncologist is warranted. In other patients whom the evaluation of their adnexal mass remains unclear surgical excision with care not to disrupt the integrity of the mass should be performed for pathologic diagnosis."

CD011126,0,21054077,0,Quantitative imaging reveals heterogeneous growth dynamics and treatment-dependent residual tumor distributions in a three-dimensional ovarian cancer model.,"Three-dimensional tumor models have emerged as valuable in vitro research tools, though the power of such systems as quantitative reporters of tumor growth and treatment response has not been adequately explored. We introduce an approach combining a 3-D model of disseminated ovarian cancer with high-throughput processing of image data for quantification of growth characteristics and cytotoxic response. We developed custom MATLAB routines to analyze longitudinally acquired dark-field microscopy images containing thousands of 3-D nodules. These data reveal a reproducible bimodal log-normal size distribution. Growth behavior is driven by migration and assembly, causing an exponential decay in spatial density concomitant with increasing mean size. At day 10, cultures are treated with either carboplatin or photodynamic therapy (PDT). We quantify size-dependent cytotoxic response for each treatment on a nodule by nodule basis using automated segmentation combined with ratiometric batch-processing of calcein and ethidium bromide fluorescence intensity data (indicating live and dead cells, respectively). Both treatments reduce viability, though carboplatin leaves micronodules largely structurally intact with a size distribution similar to untreated cultures. In contrast, PDT treatment disrupts micronodular structure, causing punctate regions of toxicity, shifting the distribution toward smaller sizes, and potentially increasing vulnerability to subsequent chemotherapeutic treatment."

The causes include trauma, obturator hernia, pelvic cancer, pelvic surgery, hip surgery, following pelvic fractures, endometriosis, retroperitoneal hematoma, pregnancy, and delivery. Ultrasound (US) guidance facilitates real-time imaging, identification of vascular structures, and improves patient comfort in situations where nerve stimulation can be unpleasant. This is a case report of ON successfully treated with US-guided steroid injection. A 55-year-old man was referred to the pain clinic with groin pain and allodynia in the medial thigh and knee following a fall. He had tried multiple other therapies and none of them provided significant relief. Using a 10-5-MHz multi-frequency, 38-mm linear array transducer, the obturator nerve was scanned in both longitudinal and transverse directions. Under real-time imaging 10 mg of medroxy-progesterone in a volume of 1 mL was injected. Following the injection, a small area of the medial side of knee was still tender to light touch. A second injection was placed inferiorly and provided pain relief for more than 5 months. This successful demonstration of US guidance in ON may further encourage US guidance in pain clinic interventions."

CD011126,0,23319619,0,Single-particle EM reveals extensive conformational variability of the Ltn1 E3 ligase.,"Ltn1 is a 180-kDa E3 ubiquitin ligase that associates with ribosomes and marks certain aberrant, translationally arrested nascent polypeptide chains for proteasomal degradation. In addition to its evolutionarily conserved large size, Ltn1 is characterized by the presence of a conserved N terminus, HEAT/ARM repeats predicted to comprise the majority of the protein, and a C-terminal catalytic RING domain, although the protein's exact structure is unknown. We used numerous single-particle EM strategies to characterize Ltn1's structure based on negative stain and vitreous ice data. Two-dimensional classifications and subsequent 3D reconstructions of electron density maps show that Ltn1 has an elongated form and presents a continuum of conformational states about two flexible hinge regions, whereas its overall architecture is reminiscent of multisubunit cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes. We propose a model of Ltn1 function based on its conformational variability and flexibility that describes how these features may play a role in cotranslational protein quality control."

They underwent ovulation induction and on a random and blind basis, patients were assigned to receive silymarin (70 mg x 3/day) or placebo from the beginning of the induction cycle. The number and quality of oocytes retrieved were evaluated and apoptosis of > or = granolusa cells was studied. There was no significant difference between the groups for mean number of follicles 18 mm (P = 0.131), mean number of oocytes retrieved (P = 0.209) or endometrial thickness (P = 0.673). However, the proportion of total apoptosis in the study group was significantly lower than in the placebo group (P = 0.032). These data suggest that administration of silymarin in IVF patients concomitantly with gonadotropin results in reduction of granolusa cell apoptosis but does not have any effect in promotion of follicular development, oocyte retrieval or endometrial thickness."
CD011126,0,16159338,0,Three-dimensional modelling of wheat endosperm development.,"We have developed methods, based on confocal microscopy and three-dimensional (3D) modelling, for the analysis of complex tissues and individual nuclei. These methods were used to study the development of early wheat (Triticum aestivum) endosperm as a whole and of endosperm nuclei undergoing polyploidization. Fixed sections of immature caryopses were either stained with SYTOX Green or used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize centromeres, telomeres and a rye chromosome arm substitution. Each section was imaged as a confocal image stack. By using Amira 3.0 for computer image processing, rendered models were produced of the whole endosperm and of individual nuclei. We followed endosperm development up to the formation of a complete syncytium, which develops via a dorsal and a ventral plate of nuclei in the central cell. Modelling of nuclei showed that wheat chromosomes are not anchored to the nuclear membrane and become more randomly positioned in endoreduplicated nuclei. This analysis produced a precise description of the positioning of nuclei throughout the developing endosperm and of chromosomal domains in single nuclei."

Radiography, employing ultrasound procedures, is the most commonly used pre-surgical detection method but only histological examination makes the diagnosis. The malignance recognition by pathological study not always is easy; in this sense, it requires an exhaustive sampling of the lesion, being specially carefully in some aspects related with malignant transformation such as extending beyond the capsula and involving peripheral tissues. A thyroidal differentiation must be confirmed by immunohistochemical study and other local processes with similar histology should be ruled out. Given the exceptional character of malignant forms, there does not appear to be unanimous agreement on a standard therapy with a somewhat uncertain prognosis."

In-vitro studies have shown a relationship between CAG repeats in the AR gene and its transactivation potential. This variation in length may play a role in anovulatory infertility. The objective of this study was to investigate whether CAG polymorphism of the AR gene has a predictive value for ovarian reserve, response and cycle outcome in an egg donor programme. CAG length of the AR gene was determined in 147 oocyte donors. All donors underwent ovarian stimulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol (n = 355). No differences were reported in days of stimulation, gonadotrophin doses, and number of oocytes retrieved. Clinical outcomes were not affected by the CAG repeat length of the AR gene; the primary end-point, antral follicle count, was significantly affected (P < 0.05). In conclusion, in a population of fertile egg donors AR gene CAG polymorphism does not affect ovarian response to gonadotrophins. Antral follicle count was associated with the CAG polymorphism genotype. This suggests that genetic factors may increase susceptibility to poor ovarian reserve, and that AR gene genotype could play a role in the natural ovarian ageing process."

CD011126,0,23069740,0,Ovarian reserve parameters: a comparison between users and non-users of hormonal contraception.,"It remains controversial whether anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentration is influenced by hormonal contraception. This study quantified the effect of hormonal contraception on both endocrine and sonographic ovarian reserve markers in 228 users and 504 non-users of hormonal contraception. On day 2-5 of the menstrual cycle or during withdrawal bleeding, blood sampling and transvaginal sonography was performed. After adjusting for age, ovarian reserve parameters were lower among users than among non-users of hormonal contraception: serum AMH concentration by 29.8% (95% CI 19.9 to 38.5%), antral follicle count (AFC) by 30.4% (95% CI 23.6 to 36.7%) and ovarian volume by 42.2% (95% CI 37.8 to 46.3%). AFC in all follicle size categories (small, 2-4 mm; intermediate, 5-7 mm; large, 8-10 mm) was lower in users than in non-users of hormonal contraception. A negatively linear association was observed between duration of hormonal-contraception use and ovarian reserve parameters. No dose-response relation was found between the dose of ethinyloestradiol and AMH or AFC. This study indicates that ovarian reserve markers are lower in women using sex steroids for contraception. Thus, AMH concentration and AFC may not retain their accuracy as predictors of ovarian reserve in women using hormonal contraception. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentration is an indirect marker of the number of small follicles in the ovary and thereby the ovarian reserve. The AMH concentration is now widely used as one of the markers of the ovarian reserve in ovarian hormonal stimulation regimens. Hence the AMH concentration in a patient is used to decide the dose of the ovarian hormonal stimulation prior to IVF treatment. In some infertile patients, hormonal contraception is used prior to ovarian hormonal stimulation and therefore it is important to clarify whether serum AMH concentration is influenced by the use of sex steroids. The aim of this study was to quantify the potential effect of hormonal contraception on the ovarian function by hormonal analyses and ovarian ultrasound examination. Examinations were performed in the early phase of the menstrual cycle or the hormone-free interval of hormonal contraception. We compared the AMH concentration, the antral follicle count (AFC) and the ovarian volume in 228 users versus 504 non-users of hormonal contraception. Users of hormonal contraception had 29.8% lower AMH concentration, 30.4% lower AFC and 42.2% lower ovarian volume than non-users. These findings were more pronounced with increasing duration of hormonal contraception. No dose-response relation was found between the dose of ethinylestradiol and the impact on serum AMH and AFC. The study indicates that ovarian reserve markers are lower in women using sex steroids for contraception. Thus, serum AMH concentration and AFC may not retain their accuracy as predictors of the ovarian reserve in women using hormonal contraception."

We aimed to analyze uterine, spiral, and intraovarian artery blood flow by Doppler ultrasonography in hyperprolactinemic patients prior to and after treatment with cabergoline. The study was conducted in Sisli Etfal Training and Research Hospital gynecology outpatient clinic between 1 March 2010 and 30 September 2011. Twenty-four women with symptomatic hyperprolactinemia in reproduction age were included in the study. All hyperprolactinemic patients were studied prior to and following the suppression of circulating PRL levels by cabergoline. Patients were examined by standard B-mod and color transvaginal ultrasonography. Pulsality index (PI), resistance index (RI), and systolic/diastolic ratio (S/D) were recorded. The median PRL value was 86 (62-120) ng/ml before treatment and 4.0 (2.5-6.4) ng/ml after the treatment (p < 0.001). We found a significant association among PRL, uterine, spiral, and intraovarian artery RI with linear regression analysis (p < 0.001 for all three arteries). Uterine, spiral, and intraovarian artery PI (p = 0.021, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively) and RI (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively) significantly decreased after cabergoline treatment.

Twenty-one patients who had received conventional colonoscopy after CT colonography were selected; 18 patients had either colon polyps or colon cancer and three had no findings. CT colonography was performed using a 4-channel multi-detector-row (MDR) CT in ten cases and a 16-channel MDR-CT in 11 cases. A blinded reader retrospectively evaluated all colonographies using both viewing methods in a randomized order. Thirty-seven polyps were identified by optical colonoscopy. An overall per-lesion sensitivity of 47.1% for lesions smaller than 5 mm, 56.3% for lesions between 5 mm and 10 mm, and 75.0% for lesion larger than 10 mm was calculated using the colon dissection approach. This compared to an overall per-lesion sensitivity of 35.3% (<5 mm), 81.5% (5-10 mm), and 100.0% (>10 mm) using the endoluminal view. The average time consumption for CT colonography evaluation with the colon dissection software was 10 min versus 38 min using the endoluminal view. A colon dissection approach may provide a significant time advantage for evaluation of CT colonography while obtaining a high sensitivity. It is especially superior in the detection of lesions smaller than 5 mm."

This retrospective cohort analysis investigated if women undergoing oocyte donation cycles with sonographic evidence of endometrial insufficiency benefit from adjuvant medicaltherapy. Infertile patients received 503 mock cycles followed by 503 anonymous oocyte donation cycles. One hundred and twenty-three patients received adjuvant therapy during a donor oocyte cycle. Patients who had a mock endometrial thickness > or = 8 mm experienced a significant decrease in endometrial thickness with the donor oocyte cycle regardless of the use of adjuvant therapy (P < 0.001). In contrast, those patients with a mock endometrial thickness < 8 mm experienced a significant increase in donor oocyte cycle endometrial thickness regardless of adjuvant therapy use (P < 0.001). The patients with a mock endometrial thickness < 8 mm experienced a significant improvement in pregnancy rates when taking adjuvant therapy (87.7 versus 73.5%, P < 0.05).

CD011126,0,23060199,0,Uterine arteriovenous malformation formed in a large uterine cervical myoma.,"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) can arise in various organs, particularly the brain, but it is rare in the uterus. Uterine AVM is potentially lethal and is generally associated with uterine trauma, such as dilatation and curettage, therapeutic abortion or uterine surgery. On the other hand, uterine myoma is the most common benign gynecological tumor, but uterine cervical myoma is rare and grows in the extraperitoneal space, with development of complex capillary networks within the tumor. Cervical myoma surgery is therefore a difficult operation with a risk of massive bleeding. We report herein a patient with uterine AVM formed within a large cervical myoma in a postmenopausal woman. The patient was a 55-year-old Japanese woman who complained of lower abdominal distension. Ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed an 18 × 20-cm uterine cervical tumor with dilatation of numerous vessels. Pelvic angiography was scheduled to provide accurate diagnosis and to minimize intraoperative blood loss. In fact, preoperative pelvic angiography allowed us to identify the true feeding artery and drainage veins. Occlusion of the feeding artery with a balloon device is effective in decreasing intraoperative bleeding. Abdominal total hysterectomy was performed as the surgical management of this uterine AVM. Prophylactic endovascular balloon occlusion of the ipsilateral internal iliac artery reduced the amount of hemorrhage during surgery, although blood transfusion was needed in our patient. In conclusion, preoperative embolosclerotherapy should be considered as a treatment option in patients with AVM present in a large uterine cervical myoma."
CD011126,0,16970130,0,[Heterotopic pregnancy].,"The heterotopic pregnancy is a combination of an intra-uterine and extra-uterine pregnancy, at the same time. The spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy is a rare illness with an estimated frequency below one per 20,000 and one per 30,000. The first case was reported in France by Duverney in 1708 during an autopsy. The frequency of this pregnancy has increased with the implementation of assisted reproduction techniques. This paper is the report of a case of spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy seen at the Angeles Mexico Hospital. A 32 year old woman, gravida 1; dilatation and curettage was performed on 13th February because of a blighted ovum, a lot of products of conception were obtained. The patient was discharged the next day only with analgesics. She returns to the emergency room on February 16th with hypovolemic shock and acute abdomen. A normocitic normocromic anemia was found on the hematic biometry, the transvaginal ultrasound reported amount of blood in the cul-de-sac, echogenic adnexal mass, suggesting a gestational sac with embryo. An emergency laparotomy was used to perform a left cornual resection; the findings were 600 cc of hemoperitoneum and a left ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She had an uneventful postoperative course, and was discharged 72 hours later without complications. Heterotopic pregnancy is a rare illness and must always be considered for the increase in pregnancy related with assisted reproduction techniques, although, it should be considered in a spontaneous pregnancy too."
CD011126,0,25771399,0,Intraoperative Transrectal Ultrasonography for Hysteroscopic Metroplasty: Feasibility and Safety.,"The primary objective of this prospective comparative nonrandomized study was to assess the feasibility and safety of intraoperative transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) during hysteroscopic metroplasty (HM). The secondary objective of the study was to assess whether TRUS facilitates complete removal of the uterine septum. Septate uterus was diagnosed by 3-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonography (3D-TVS) and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. In the control group (HM group; n = 18), patients underwent HM according to the traditional standard of operative hysteroscopy. In the study group (HM+TRUS group; n = 27), HM and TRUS were performed simultaneously; the hysteroscopic procedure was continued until a normal uterine fundus was observed. At 6 to 8 weeks after HM, 3D-TVS was performed to identify the numbers of complete resections (residual septum absent or <5 mm), suboptimal resections (residual septum 5-10 mm), and incomplete resections (residual septum > 10 mm). The 2 study groups did not differ significantly in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics, or in the volume of fluid infused and absorbed. There were no severe intraoperative or postoperative complication in either group; 2 patients in the HM+TRUS group and 1 patient in the HM group experienced urinary tract infection (p = .807). At 6 to 8 weeks after HM, the number of suboptimal resections and incomplete resections was higher in the HM group than in the HM+TRUS group (p = .031). Residual septum >10 mm (incomplete resection) was seen in 1 patient in the HM group but in no patients in the HM+TRUS group. Intraoperative TRUS can be performed safely during HM, and may increase the likelihood of complete resection of the uterine septum; however, this finding should be confirmed by larger studies."

CD011126,0,19664604,0,"Structure prediction and functional analysis of KdsD, an enzyme involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.","Lipopolysaccharide is an essential component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and consists of three elements: lipid A, the core oligosaccharide and the O-antigen. The inner core region is highly conserved and contains at least one residue of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (Kdo). The first committed step of Kdo biosynthesis is the aldol-keto isomerisation of d-ribulose 5-phosphate to d-arabinose 5-phosphate catalyzed by arabinose 5-phosphate isomerase encoded in Escherichia coli by the kdsD gene. KdsD contains an N-terminal sugar isomerase (SIS) domain commonly found in phosphosugar isomerases but its three-dimensional structure is unknown. The structure of the KdsD SIS domain has been predicted by homology modeling using the hypothetical 3etn protein as a template. Moreover by sequence alignments, comparison with other sugar isomerases structurally related to KdsD, and site-directed mutagenesis we implicated four residues in KdsD activity or substrate recognition. A possible role of these residues in the catalysis is discussed."

Cells were obtained from 12 voided urine samples from 4 healthy individuals. USC were isolated, characterized and induced to differentiate into UC and SMC. Fresh SIS derived from pigs was decellularized with 5% peracetic acid (PAA). Differentiated UC and SMC derived from USC were seeded onto SIS scaffolds with highly porous microstructure in a layered co-culture fashion and cultured under dynamic conditions for one week. The seeded cells formed multiple uniform layers on the SIS and penetrated deeper into the porous matrix during dynamic culture. USC that were induced to differentiate also expressed UC markers (Uroplakin-III and AE1/AE3) or SMC markers (α-SM actin, desmin, and myosin) after implantation into athymic mice for one month, and the resulting tissues were similar to those formed when UC and SMC derived from native ureter were used. In conclusion, UC and SMC derived from USC could be maintained on 3-D porous SIS scaffold. The dynamic culture system promoted 3-D cell-matrix ingrowth and development of a multilayer mucosal structure similar to that of native urinary tract tissue. USC may serve as an alternative cell source in cell-based tissue engineering for urethral reconstruction or other urological tissue repair."

Nineteen patients with suspected advanced ovarian carcinoma (FIGO stage 3 or higher) were enrolled in this prospective study. Up to three marker lesions were identified: primary ovarian mass, omental ''cake'', and peritoneal deposits. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed using a three-dimensional T(1)-weighted gradient-echo acquisition with a temporal resolution of 1.6 sec, following intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol. Precontrast T(1) mapping, using an inversion-recovery fast gradient-echo sequence, was also performed. Imaging was completed in 18/19 patients, although two were subsequently excluded based on pathology results. Pharmacokinetic modeling of the data was performed according to the extended Kety model, using an arterial input function formed by concatenation of the Fritz-Hansen and Weinmann curves. No statistically significant differences were found between the results for the three marker lesions. In the future, this work will allow kinetic modeling results from ovarian dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to be correlated with response to treatment.

Most colorectal cancers develop from adenomatous polyps over a number of years. Early detection of polyps eliminates the risk of subsequent carcinomas. Computed tomographic (CT) colonography is a diagnostic technique detecting colorectal neoplasms. With the introduction of multidetector-row computed tomography (MD-CT), CT colonography (CTC) has gained influence as a new diagnostic tool in early detection of colonic pathologies by acquiring volumetric CT data sets of the abdomen. This volumetric data is analyzed using CTC workstations, which provide an interactive display of 2D and 3D images of the colon. In several studies, CTC revealed a high accuracy (sensitivity/patient: 83-100% and specificity/patient: 93-100%) in detecting pathological colonic changes. Furthermore, CTC is an excellent diagnostic technique for the evaluation of patients with incomplete conventional colonoscopy and allows the assessment of extracolonic abdominal and pelvic organs. In this article, the status of CT colonography as a method of detecting colonic polyps and colorectal carcinomas using single- and multidetector-row CT will be reviewed."
CD011126,0,21768230,0,"Findings of pelvic endometriosis at transvaginal US, MR imaging, and laparoscopy.","Endometriosis is a common multifocal gynecologic disease that manifests during the reproductive years, often causing chronic pelvic pain and infertility. It may occur as invasive peritoneal fibrotic nodules and adhesions or as ovarian cysts with hemorrhagic content. Although findings at physical examination may be suggestive, imaging is necessary for definitive diagnosis, patient counseling, and treatment planning. The imaging techniques that are most useful for preoperative disease mapping are transvaginal ultrasonography (US) after bowel preparation, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Initial transvaginal US is a reliable technique for detecting rectosigmoid endometriotic lesions. MR imaging is indicated as a complementary examination in complex cases of endometriosis with extensive adhesions and ureteral involvement. Peritoneal endometriotic implants are typically hypoechoic on transvaginal US images and demonstrate low signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images. Endometriotic implants most commonly are found in retrocervical and rectosigmoid sites, followed by the vagina, bladder, and ureters. Cysts with low-level internal echoes and echogenic peripheral foci at transvaginal US are suggestive of endometriomas. MR imaging has high specificity for identifying endometriomas, which are characterized by high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Correlation of the radiologic imaging features of endometriotic lesions with their laparoscopic appearances may help improve individual proficiency in the radiologic diagnosis of endometriosis."

We sought to analyze the clinical and echocardiographic features of intracardiac leiomyomatosis. From January 2003 through July 2012, 7 women (age range, 24-59 yr) underwent surgical resection of histopathologically diagnosed intracardiac leiomyomas at our hospital. Most of the patients had histories of hysterectomy or uterine leiomyoma. We retrospectively analyzed their preoperative echocardiograms. We found that the tumors had no stalks, did not adhere to the wall of the right side of the heart, were highly mobile, and moved back and forth in the right atrium near the tricuspid orifice. All tumors originated from the inferior vena cava and had borders well demarcated from that structure's wall. Most of the masses extended into the inferior vena cava and right atrium through the right internal and common iliac veins. Computed tomograms revealed pelvic tumors and contiguous filling defects in 6 patients. When echocardiograms reveal a right-sided cardiac mass that originates from the inferior vena cava, particularly in women who have a history of hysterectomy or uterine leiomyoma, intracardiac leiomyomatosis should be suspected. If the mass has no stalk and freely moves within the inferior vena cava and right-sided cardiac chambers without attachment to the endothelial surface or endocardium, intracardiac leiomyomatosis should be diagnosed. We discuss our findings and briefly review the relevant medical literature."

The authors are investigating methods to take advantage of all the imaging information available for joint target registration and segmentation, including multimodality images or multiple image sets from the same modality. In particular, the authors have developed variational methods based on multivalued level set deformable models for simultaneous 2D or 3D segmentation of multimodality images consisting of combinations of coregistered PET, CT, or MR data sets. The combined information is integrated to define the overall biophysical structure volume. The authors demonstrate the methods on three patient data sets, including a nonsmall cell lung cancer case with PET/CT, a cervix cancer case with PET/CT, and a prostate patient case with CT and MRI. CT, PET, and MR phantom data were also used for quantitative validation of the proposed multimodality segmentation approach. The corresponding Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was 0.90 +/- 0.02 (p < 0.0001) with an estimated target volume error of 1.28 +/- 1.23% volume. Preliminary results indicate that concurrent multimodality segmentation methods can provide a feasible and accurate framework for combining imaging data from different modalities and are potentially useful tools for the delineation of biophysical structure volumes in radiotherapy treatment planning."

CD011126,0,24597271,0,Ovarian torsion associated with cessation of hormonal treatment for polycystic ovarian syndrome: a case report.,"Torsion of an ovary or fallopian tube (adnexal torsion) usually occurs in ovaries with tumors or functional cysts. In polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the ovaries are bilaterally enlarged, but these enlarged ovaries rarely twist. Recently, the authors encountered a PCOS patient with ovarian torsion after the cessation of Kaufmann treatment. The etiological factors were unclear, but the authors suggest that the increase in ovarian volume was due to transient hypergonadotropic feedback. Thus, more attention should be paid to adnexal torsion that may arise subsequent to transient hypergonadtropic states, in relation to the cessation of hormonal treatment, and enlarged ovaries in PCOS patients."

CD011126,0,21667025,0,Non-invasive monitoring of hypoxia-inducible factor activation by optical imaging during antiangiogenic treatment in a xenograft model of ovarian carcinoma.,"Targeting the hypoxia response pathway and angiogenesis are two promising therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Their use as single strategies has important limitations. Thus, development of combined regimens has become an important step toward improving therapeutic efficacy. Also, non-invasive monitoring of the response to targeted biological therapies, as well as determination of the optimal schedule for combination regimens has become an active field of research over the last five years, with relevance for both preclinical and clinical settings. Here, we used an optical imaging method to non-invasively monitor the functional changes in HIF activity in response to antiangiogenic treatment in a xenograft model of human ovarian carcinoma. A bioluminescent reporter construct containing nine copies of the hypoxia response element upstream of the luciferase gene (9xHRE-luciferase) was characterized in vitro in a panel of tumor cell lines and in vivo in a subcutaneous xenograft model of ovarian carcinoma by means of optical imaging. We showed that in OVCAR-3 subcutaneous xenografts, the most abrupt change in the HIF functional reporter occurs before the onset of massive tumor growth. However, this system failed to detect hypoxia induced upon antiangiogenic treatment due to the compensating effects of increased hypoxia and decreased tumor cell viability caused by imbalanced neovascularization vs. tumor expansion. Therefore, the readout based on HIF functional reporter could be conditioned by the dynamics of tumor growth and angiogenesis, which is highly variable depending on the tumor type, tumor model and stage of progression."

CD011126,0,25367011,0,Emerging HIFU applications in cancer therapy.,"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), is a promising, non-invasive modality for treatment of tumours in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging or diagnostic ultrasound guidance. HIFU is being used increasingly for treatment of prostate cancer and uterine fibroids. Over the last 10 years a growing number of clinical trials have examined HIFU treatment of both benign and malignant tumours of the liver, breast, pancreas, bone, connective tissue, thyroid, parathyroid, kidney and brain. For some of these emerging indications, HIFU is poised to become a serious alternative or adjunct to current standard treatments--including surgery, radiation, gene therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Current commercially available HIFU devices are marketed for their thermal ablation applications. In the future, lower energy treatments may play a significant role in mediating targeted drug and gene delivery for cancer treatment. In this article we introduce currently available HIFU systems, provide an overview of clinical trials in emerging oncological targets, and briefly discuss selected pre-clinical research that is relevant to future oncological HIFU applications."

CD011126,0,18020917,0,Multiple ovarian cysts in a young girl with severe hypothyroidism.,"Case study of a young female patient with severe hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis and multiple ovarian cysts is reported. A 14-year 7-month-old girl presented with pelvic and abdominal pain and severe asthenia. Her last menstrual period was 10 months before presentation. Physical examination showed obesity; apathetic and flat expression; periorbital puffiness; pale, cold, dry skin and slow sustained reflexes; swelling in the hands and feet; no galactorrhea; a hardly palpable thyroid gland; and ovaries with a palpable irregular surface. Her heart rate was 90 bpm with a blood pressure within the normal range (110/70 mmHg). Laboratory findings showed severe hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]: 960 mIU/L), gravis macrocytic anemia, hyperfibrinogenemia, and hyperprolactinemia. Imaging examinations revealed a normal-size thyroid with irregular echogenicity, strongly hypoechogenous area at the neck ultrasonography, bilateral multilocular ovarian masses with cystic components at pelvic ultrasound and computed tomography, and both anterior and posterior pericardial effusion at echocardiography. As soon as thyroid replacement therapy was initiated, all symptoms progressively disappeared and biochemical and hormonal values normalized, while the right ovary did not decrease in size during the follow-up period. For this reason, our patient underwent right ovarian wedge resection 14 months after the initiation of medication replacement. Ovarian histological examination showed a benign ovarian cyst with extensive hemorrhage and myxedematous infiltration. It is concluded that it is important to recognize early in young girls the association between large multiple ovarian cysts and high elevated levels of TSH in order to resolve this disorder with substitutive therapy."

This study included 70 postmenopausal estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients who switched to anastrozole after tamoxifen; patients had endometrial thickness >4mm and no endometrial malignancy. Endometrial thickness was measured after anastrozole treatment. Endometrial thickness during anastrozole therapy was lower than after tamoxifen therapy (p<0.001); the mean reduction in endometrial thickness was 4.5mm (+/-3.0). Cystic endometrial appearance was more frequent in patients under tamoxifen than in those under anastrozole (p<0.001). Duration of tamoxifen therapy was not correlated to the endometrial thickness at the time of its suspension. Duration of tamoxifen therapy and endometrial thickness at the time of tamoxifen suspension was correlated to the relative reduction of endometrial thickness during anastrozole therapy.

On admission, fetal movements were felt and fetal heart rate was detected by Doppler ultrasound. Over the course of 12 h, although she maintained her vital signs, repeat laboratory and radiological investigations suggested sinister intra-abdominal pathology. Subsequently, fetal movements and heart rate ceased and the patient began to decompensate. A CT scan confirmed uterine rupture. Subsequent emergency laparotomy revealed a 2 l haemoperitoneum and lifeless fetoplacental unit in the abdominal cavity. It is postulated that this rupture occurred as a rare yet life-threatening complication of a hysteroscopic resection of fibroid that the patient underwent 1 year previously. There are no known published cases of a spontaneous uterine rupture following a hysteroscopic procedure at such an early gestation. The patient made a full physical recovery."

CD011126,0,17308146,0,Laparoscopic management of the adnexal mass.,"In the past few years the contribution of operative laparoscopy in all fields of gynecological surgery has been revolutionary. Nowadays laparoscopic management of adnexal masses is the most frequently performed laparoscopic intervention. Laparoscopy in comparison to laparotomy has the advantages of lower morbidity, shorter length of hospital stay, decreased postoperative pain, lesser de novo adhesion formation, better cosmetic results, faster recovery, and reduced overall cost of care. However, careful preoperative evaluation is important for the appropriate and successful use of laparoscopy for removal of adnexal masses and the advantages of the laparoscopic approach should, in no way, compromise the clinical outcome in women with malignancy. Patient's age, history, findings of physical examination, and the results of serum markers in combination with the imaging assessment, such as Doppler sonography, CT, or MRI, should be considered to reach the diagnosis preoperatively. However, only pathology of the adnexal mass can provide the definitive diagnosis. The specific characteristics of the adnexal masses in childhood, adolescent, reproductive, and postmenopausal age represent the essential parameters that will determine the therapeutic strategy to be followed. Furthermore, the clinician has to determine whether an adnexal mass requires surgery or expectant management as well as to estimate the possibility of malignancy."
CD011126,0,23656393,0,Assisted reproductive technique increases the risk of placental polyp.,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the risk factors and outcomes of placental polyp. This retrospective study was conducted on 1645 patients delivered or aborted in Sapporo Medical University from 2007 through 2011. Transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography, hysteroscopy, contrast-enhanced MRI or 3D-CT angiography were performed. There were 1532 deliveries and 113 abortions. Seventy-one (4.3%) were ART-conceived and the remaining 1574 (95.7%) were non-ART pregnancies. Fifteen (0.91%) cases were confirmed as having placental polyp. Nine cases of placental polyp were identified among the 1574 (0.57%) as non-ART-related pregnancies, and 6 were identified among the 71 (8.5%) as ART-related pregnancies. Thus, pregnancies achieved through ART showed 20x greater incidence of complicating placental polyp than pregnancies achieved through without ART (p = 9.02 × 10(-6); odds ratio, 19.59; 95% confidence interval, 5.27-72.84, logistic regression analysis). Evaluation of blood flow within the polyp showed that in five of seven patients with low blood flow, the polyps spontaneously dropped off 79-115 days postpartum. Thus, ART-related pregnancies may be a risk factor of placental polyp, and spontaneous drop-off of the polyp is often observed in cases with low blood flow within the mass."

CD011126,0,24832109,0,Malignant and premalignant changes in the endometrium of women with an ultrasound diagnosis of endometrial polyp.,"The association between polyps and endometrial cancer is under debate. The main objectives of this study were to study the frequency and the characteristics of malignant and premalignant endometrial changes in women with endometrial polyp at ultrasound. The study population consisted of 1,390 consecutive patients that were referred to office hysteroscopy because of the ultrasonographic diagnosis of endometrial polyps. A total of 16 cases of endometrial neoplasia were diagnosed (1.15%). The frequencies of atypia and cancer in our population were 0.14% and 1.01%, respectively. All patients, except one, were postmenopausal (93.8%). All had undergone the initial ultrasonographic assessment because of symptoms (bleeding in the 93.8%). The neoplasia was not confined to the polyp in 75% of the cases. Nine cases had a lower risk disease (56.25%; atypical hyperplasia or endometrial cancer stage IA-G1,2), while seven had a higher risk cancer (43.75%; ≥ stage IA-G3). Patients with a higher risk disease were found to be significantly younger, and their polyps were smaller, albeit non-significantly. In spite of the common practice to refer all women with an ultrasound diagnosis of polyp to hysteroscopy, our data show how the prevalence of endometrial neoplasia in these patients is low (1.15%). Moreover, the malignancy is not confined to a polyp in most of the cases."
CD011126,0,20574981,0,Electrospun micro/nanofibrous conduits composed of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) and small intestine submucosa powder for nerve tissue regeneration.,"Three-dimensional biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds play important roles in tissue engineering. In this study, fibrous mats composed of electrospun poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)/small intestine submucosa (SIS) tubes were fabricated with a high degree of longitudinal alignment as a conduit for peripheral nerves. Fourier transform infrared analyses of electrospun PCL/SIS mats with various amounts of SIS showed that the SIS was well embedded within the PCL matrix. The diameter of the PCL/SIS fibers with the 3 wt % of SIS in the PCL solution decreased 40% relative to that of pure PCL fibers due to increased electrical conductivity and decreased surface tension. PCL/SIS (3 wt %) electrospun mats exhibited various synergistic effects, including stronger mechanical properties (Young's modulus = more than 80%) and enhanced hydrophilicity (water contact angle at 30 min = 54 degrees ) relative to pure PCL (water contact angle at 30 min = 142 degrees ). Cell attachment and proliferation experiments demonstrated that the interactions between nerve cells (PC-12) and the PCL/SIS conduits were more favorable than those between PC-12 cells and a pure PCL conduit. This study contributes to the understanding of the effects of including SIS in electrospun composite mats. The ability to fabricate highly aligned tubes of PCL/SIS with appropriate mechanical properties and cellular interactions shows great potential for the design of nerve regeneration conduits."

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of our novel computed tomography (CT)-guided free-hand high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDRISBT) technique for cervical cancer by evaluating the dosimetry and preliminary clinical outcome of this approach. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were analyzed according to the Gynecological GEC-ESTRO Working Group recommendations for image-based 3D treatment in cervical cancer. Twenty cervical cancer patients who underwent CT-guided free-hand HDRISBT between March 2009 and June 2010 were studied. With a median of 5 (range, 4-7) implanted needles for each patient, the median dose of brachytherapy alone delivered to 90% of the target volume (D90) was 45 (range, 33-54) Gyα/β10 for high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) and 30 (range, 20-36) Gyα/β10 for intermediate-risk clinical target volume (IR-CTV). The percentage of the CTV covered by the prescribed dose (V100) of HR-CTV with brachytherapy alone was 81.9%-99.2% (median, 96.7%). With an additional dose of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), the median D90 was 94 (range, 83-104) Gyα/β10 for HR-CTV and 77 (range, 70-87) Gyα/β10 for IR-CTV; the median dose delivered to 100% of the target volume (D100) was 75 (range, 66-84) Gyα/β10 for HR-CTV and 65 (range, 57-73) Gyα/β10 for IR-CTV. The minimum dose to the most irradiated 2 cc volume (D2cc) was 73-96 (median, 83) Gyα/β3 for the bladder, 64-98 (median, 73) Gyα/β3 for the rectum, and 52-69 (median, 61) Gyα/β3 for the sigmoid colon. After a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 3-24 months), two patients experienced local failure, and 1 showed internal iliac nodal metastasis. Despite the relatively small number of needles used, CT-guided HDRISBT for cervical cancer showed favorable DVH parameters and clinical outcome."

After randomisation, a group of 17 women received metformin 500 mg b.d. (MG) and a group of 18 received rosiglitazone 4 mg o.d. (RG) for 3 months. Serum FSH, LH, testosterone, fasting glucose, insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, CRP were measured at baseline and follow-up. Ovarian scan and microcirculation studies were also performed. It was found that there was a reduction in hyperandrogenaemia, insulin resistance, lipidaemia, CRP levels, ovarian volume and number of follicles in both groups. No improvement in endothelial- dependent function was noted but a significant improvement in endothelial-independent function in rosiglitazone group. It was concluded that low-dose therapeutic regimen with rosiglitazone and metformin, has comparable beneficial impacts on metabolic, hormonal and morphological features of PCOS but no obvious effect on vascular parameters in a population of predominantly mild PCOS."
CD011126,0,7851813,0,Sonohysterography versus hysteroscopy in the diagnosis of endouterine polyps.,"The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the usefulness of abdominal and vaginal sonohysterography (SHG; considered both singly and in combination) for the diagnosis of uterine polyps. Fifty fertile women hospitalized for hysterectomy for benign gynecologic indications were enrolled. Main outcome measures were preoperative conventional vaginosonography, transabdominal and vaginal SHG, hysteroscopy and histologic evaluation of the surgical specimen. Conventional vaginosonography had a sensitivity of 33.3% and a specificity of 100%; the predictive values of abnormal and normal scans were 100 and 79.5%, respectively. Transabdominal SHG had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100%. The predictive value of an abnormal scan was 100%; that of a normal scan 91.2%. Vaginal SHG had a sensitivity of 58.3% and a specificity of 100%; the predictive value of an abnormal scan was 100%, that of a normal scan 86.1%. The combination of the two kinds of SHG had a sensitivity of 91.7% and specificity of 100%; the predictive value of an abnormal test was 100% and that of a normal test 96.9%. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of abnormal and normal hysteroscopic examination were all 100%. In conclusion, the presence of endouterine polyps can be effectively investigated by SHG; nevertheless, hysteroscopy is more sensitive, being capable of detecting even very small endouterine neoformations."

CD011126,0,21891913,0,Cemento-ossifying fibroma.,"Cemento-ossifying fibromas (COFs) are benign lesions affecting the jaws and other craniofacial bones. They commonly affect adult females between the third and fourth decade of life, predominantly occurring in the premolar/molar region of the mandible. Most of the lesions typically show slow and often expansile growth, centrally within the jaw and characteristically behave in a benign form, but occasionally they may present as an aggressive gigantiform lesion. Radiographically, they appear as well-defined unilocular or multilocular intraosseous masses. The lesion is invariably encapsulated and of mixed radiolucent densities. The tumor may grow quite extensively; thus, the term ""aggressive"" is sometimes applied. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice. They are insensitive to radiotherapy and recurrences are uncommon. Clinical, radiographic and histopathologic features of COF and other fibro-osseous lesions are overlapping and may cause confusion in classification, diagnosis and treatment."

CD011126,0,24835290,0,Contribution of perioperative imaging to radioguided surgery.,"Radioguided surgery has been investigated and applied to almost any neoplastic disease that is surgically treated. The impact of radioguided surgery on the surgical management of cancer patients includes relevant and real-time information to the surgeon regarding the location and extent of the disease, as well as regarding the assessment of surgical resection margins. Despite the fact that sentinel lymph node biopsy has been worldwide accepted as a highly accurate staging method for various solid cancers (among which breast cancer and cutaneous melanoma), some potential intraoperative drawbacks still remain. This article provides an update on currently available perioperative techniques regarding the use of radiotracers for radioguided surgery and sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy, in particular in combination with vital dyes or other agents. The integration of computer technology and data processing makes it possible to integrate anatomic and functional images together with 3D rendering systems. This facilitates the targeted-tissue perioperative localization, especially in anatomically complex areas. Furthermore, we provide an update on advances in the integration of intraoperative imaging devices as well as optical tracers for the surgical management of patients. Evidence is emerging that these devices, together with new potential tracers, may improve intraoperative identification of sentinel nodes and/or tumors. A detailed presentation on a portable gamma camera in breast cancer patients, and the application of perioperative imaging devices in gynaecological cancers are included. Other important procedures, such as ROLL and RSL for occult lesion excision in the breast and other organs, are extensively discussed."

CD011126,0,21441017,0,Imaging technologies for high dose rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer: a systematic review.,"The aim of this overview was to assess the utility of various imaging technologies (fluoroscopy, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography) for the treatment planning of high dose rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer. Reviews and primary studies comparing different imaging technologies used during high dose rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer and published from 1988 to 2008 were sought by searching MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, the Cochrane Library, personal files and reference lists of identified studies, and by contacting experts. Study selection, study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out in duplicate. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. No systematic reviews or randomised controlled studies (RCTs) were located. The validity assessment revealed that the quality of the existing studies is very variable. This is the first systematic review in the area of imaging technologies for cervix brachytherapy. No RCTs have been located and it is possible that an RCT is not the optimal methodology to assess imaging technologies. However, in this area there is a need for more prospective studies and for studies that consider the expertise of the operators in their design. The studies found supported the use of three-dimensional imaging as opposed to the traditional two-dimensional imaging. However, apart from the effectiveness of visualising tumours and surrounding tissues, the utility of imaging technologies in clinical practice is determined by other contextual factors, such as their availability, accessibility and ease of use."

Twenty-nine women aged 25-48 with a cellulite grade 2 according to the Nurnberger-Muller scale were included. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured. Skin structure was analyzed by ultrasonography. All subjects consumed 100 mL of OCJ per day, during 90 days. Measurements of investigated parameters were performed at 0, 45, and 90 days of the study. A marked reduction in the subcutaneous tissue thickness was observed in all subjects, with the average reduction of 1.9 mm. The length of subcutaneous tissue fascicles (ScTFL) was reduced in 97% (28 out of 29) of subjects, with the average value of 1.18 mm. After 45 days of chokeberry juice consumption, reduction of edema was observed in 55.2% of the subjects with edema at the baseline, while at the endpoint of the study, edemas were not observed in any of the subjects involved in the study. OCJ could have beneficial effects on the cellulite condition, including the length of ScTFL, subcutaneous tissue, and dermis thickness as well as on edema reduction."
CD011126,0,15823120,0,Transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic hysteroscopy as a predictor of endometrial polyps: risk factors for premalignancy and malignancy.,"The aim of this study is to assess accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and diagnostic hysteroscopy in diagnosing endometrial polyps and to determine premalignancy and malignancy rates in asymptomatic women. The study was designed to retrospectively analyze 438 women who underwent operative hysteroscopy in a day-care unit when endometrial polyp was suspected after TVUS and diagnostic hysteroscopy. Multivariate logistic regression modeling showed effects of age, previous breast cancer with tamoxifen treatment, and menopause with or without bleeding on pathologic results. The results indicate that positive predictive value of TVUS with diagnostic hysteroscopy was 79.9%. Premalignancy or malignancy occurred in 3.2% and was significantly related to menopause with abnormal bleeding (P < 0.001), which carried a 20-fold higher risk of pathology than any other group. Age was also a risk factor. It was concluded that TVUS with diagnostic hysteroscopy reliably evaluates endometrial polyps. The low incidence of endometrial tumors in asymptomatic (especially premenopausal) women suggests that their operative evaluation may not be cost effective. Larger studies are needed to support this tentative conclusion."

CD011126,0,17339150,0,Primary leiomyoma of the fallopian tube: preoperative ultrasound findings.,"Leiomyoma of the fallopian tube is extremely rare. Most cases are asymptomatic and found incidentally at autopsy or unrelated operation. These leiomyomas tend to be singular, small, and unilateral, with a resultant rare preoperative diagnosis. They are often managed with laparotomy, as seen in the literature review. Therefore, preoperative imaging is never reported. We describe a case of leiomyoma of the fallopian tube, which was suspected before operation and treated by laparoscopic approach. Transvaginal ultrasound clearly showed a hypoechoic solid mass separate from the left ovary and uterus in a 44-year-old woman. Color Doppler ultrasound detected low impedance flow in this mass. Diagnostic laparoscopy and the follow-up laparoscopic salpingoectomy revealed a primary leiomyoma of the fallopian tube. We conclude that powerful ultrasound could be helpful in diagnosing rare gynecologic disorders but laparoscopy can be used for definite diagnosis and management of such disorders."
CD011126,0,22205728,0,A functional variant in ANGPT1 and the risk of pregnancies with hypertensive disorders and small-for-gestational-age infants.,"Pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants demonstrate impaired placental vascular remodelling. Angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1) is an angiogenic growth factor which regulates vascular integrity and remodelling. The TT genotype of angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) rs2507800 polymorphism has been associated with increased plasma ANG-1 levels compared with the AA genotype. We aimed to investigate the association between ANGPT1 rs2507800 polymorphism and pregnancies complicated by gestational hypertensive disorders and SGA infants. We also aimed to investigate whether the polymorphism was associated with abnormal uterine artery Doppler as a surrogate marker of impaired placental vascular remodelling. Genotyping data of 1361 nulliparous pregnant women, 1226 partners and 1190 infants were analysed. The prevalence of ANGPT1 rs2507800 TT genotype was reduced in women with pre-eclampsia [P = 0.01, adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3-0.9], hypertensive SGA (P = 0.04, aOR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9) and SGA with abnormal uterine artery Doppler (P = 0.009, aOR, 0.4. 95% CI, 0.2-0.8) compared with women with uncomplicated pregnancy. The prevalence of maternal ANGPT1 rs2507800 TT genotype was reduced in women with increased uterine artery resistance index (P = 0.03, aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9) and bilateral notching of the uterine arteries (P = 0.004, aOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9). These results remained significant after correcting for multiple testing. Maternal ANGPT1 rs2507800 TT genotype is associated with a reduced risk for pre-eclampsia, hypertensive SGA and abnormal uterine artery Doppler. These findings suggest that the TT genotype may protect against these pregnancy disorders by increasing ANG-1 production at the maternal-fetal interface. The ANGPT1 rs2507800 polymorphism may have a potential role in screening women to predict the risk of these pregnancy complications.

CD011126,0,14968044,0,[Impact of embryo transfer techniques on implantation rates].,"Embryo transfer is an important step in the success of IVF treatment. All efforts should be made to avoid difficult embryo transfers provoking bleeding or uterine contractions. Evaluation before IVF treatment, including a trial transfer and a uterine ultrasonography, should allow one to evaluate the transfer step, anticipate problems, and thus improve treatment. An hysteroscopy can be useful for uterine cavity exploration. It is also important to remove cervical mucus before introduce the transfer catheter. It is essential to deposit embryos as gently as possible during IVF, avoiding manoeuvres that might trigger uterine contractions which could adversely affect the results of this treatment. Soft catheters perform better, and ultrasound-guidance facilitates embryo transfer. Progesterone administration starting on the day of oocyte retrieval induces a decrease in uterine contraction frequency on the day of ET (embryo transfer). Both Wallace and CDD catheters perform similarly. Trial catheterization on the day of ET could prevent most of the unanticipated procedural difficulties during the transfer."

For 15 infertile men with various sperm profiles, high-magnification microscopy was used to select motile, morphometrically normal spermatozoa with no vacuoles (n=450) or more than two small vacuoles (each of which occupied less than 4% of the head's area; n=450). Spermatozoa acrosome reaction status and degree of chromatin condensation were analysed. Three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy was used to accurately image the nucleus and acrosome at all depths in all spermatozoa. In all 450 spermatozoa with small vacuoles, the latter were seen to be abnormal, DNA-free nuclear concavities. Spermatozoa with small vacuoles were significantly more likely than vacuole-free spermatozoa to have noncondensed chromatin (39.8% versus 9.3%, respectively; P<0.0001). There was no significant difference between the two groups of spermatozoa in terms of acrosome reaction status. No association between chromatin condensation and acrosome reaction status was observed. Small human sperm vacuoles observed under high magnification are pocket-like nuclear concavities related to failure of chromatin condensation."

Twenty-five women were treated with leuprorelin acetate for 3 months; 46 untreated patients were enrolled as a control group. The uterine volume was measured by ultrasonography. After myomectomy or hysterectomy, the immunoexpression of bFGF and the endothelial marker, CD34, was studied and compared in treated and untreated leiomyomas. Uterine volume decreased after therapy. The number of cells expressing bFGF and the vascularity were diminished in treated leiomyomas. Reduction in the blood supply might be responsible, in part, for uterine-volume shrinkage after GnRH-a therapy."

The method is based on a robust segmentation method that grows a surface patch over the entire polyp surface starting from a seed. Projection of the patch points along the polyp axis yields a 2D point set to which we fit an ellipse. The long axis of the ellipse denotes the size of the polyp.

CD011126,0,16685907,0,Development of a navigation-based CAD system for colon.,"We propose a navigation-based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the colon. When diagnosing the colon using virtual colonoscopy (VC), a physician makes a diagnosis by navigating (flying-through) the colon. However, the viewpoints and the viewing directions must be changed many times because the colon is a very long and winding organ with many folds. This is a time-consuming task for physicians. We propose a new navigation-based CAD system for the colon providing virtual unfolded (VU) views, which enables physicians to observe a large area of the colonic wall at a glance. This system generates VU, VC, and CT slice views that are perfectly synchronized. Polyp candidates, which are detected automatically, are overlaid on them. We applied the system to abdominal CT images. The experimental results showed that the system effectively generates VU views for observing colon regions."

The condition is misdiagnosed as NEC and managed conservatively until clinical deterioration occurs. A definitive diagnosis is thus established during abdominal surgery, which is usually delayed an average of 9.5 days from the onset of symptoms. Our case illustrates the capability of abdominal ultrasonography to establish early diagnosis of intussusception in the premature newborn."

CD011126,0,22543913,0,The UKCTOCS experience--reasons for hope?,"There has been concern about current ovarian cancer screening strategies after the publication showing a lack of benefit from screening in the ovarian part of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. The ongoing United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening involves 202,638 low-risk postmenopausal women. The performance characteristics on prevalence screen in sensitivity, specificity, and stage distribution have been encouraging. Screening differs from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial in the use of algorithms to interpret CA125 and ultrasound imaging and well-defined, centrally coordinated management of screen-detected abnormalities with protocols for intervention based on screening findings. There is a possibility that these essential differences may be sufficient to alter the natural history of ovarian cancer and ultimately lead to demonstration of a mortality benefit from screening when the trial reports in 2014/2015."

CD011126,0,24183580,0,[Varicocele and infertility: where do we stand in 2013?].,"While the incidence of clinical varicocele is common in infertile men (about 40%), the reasons why varicocele may affect sperm parameters is still unclear. In addition, the improvement of fertility after treatment of varicocele is also a subject of debate. The purpose of this review is to get new insight into the physiopathology of varicocele, its impact on sperm parameters and the effectiveness of varicocele treatment on fertility. Treatment is likely to be effective in infertile men with clinical varicocele and impaired spermatogenesis. Even if it does not systematically lead to an improvement in sperm parameters, it may prevent further sperm degradation. In case of non-obstructive azoospermia, few studies reported a slight improvement in the process of spermatogenesis. The critical role of an adequate methodology in order to establish clinical guidelines needs to be stressed. Indeed, the huge intra-individual variability in sperm production makes the usual analysis of sperm parameters inadequate to measure treatment effectiveness. Regarding the assessment of conception, it requires not only well designed and properly sized studies but also a multivariate analysis for weighing predictive factors of success. Thus, an active scientific research is needed to better identify pathogenic agents and appropriately assess the impact of varicocele treatment."

CD011126,0,21815381,0,Registration of the endoluminal surfaces of the colon derived from prone and supine CT colonography.,"Computed tomographic (CT) colonography is a relatively new technique for detecting bowel cancer or potentially precancerous polyps. CT scanning is combined with three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction to produce a virtual endoluminal representation similar to optical colonoscopy. Because retained fluid and stool can mimic pathology, CT data are acquired with the bowel cleansed and insufflated with gas and patient in both prone and supine positions. Radiologists then match visually endoluminal locations between the two acquisitions in order to determine whether apparent pathology is real or not. This process is hindered by the fact that the colon, essentially a long tube, can undergo considerable deformation between acquisitions. The authors present a novel approach to automatically establish spatial correspondence between prone and supine endoluminal colonic surfaces after surface parameterization, even in the case of local colon collapse."

CD011126,0,16623222,0,A visual graphic/haptic rendering model for hysteroscopic procedures.,"Hysteroscopy is an extensively popular option in evaluating and treating women with infertility. The procedure utilises an endoscope, inserted through the vagina and cervix to examine the intra-uterine cavity via a monitor. The difficulty of hysteroscopy from the surgeon's perspective is the visual spatial perception of interpreting 3D images on a 2D monitor, and the associated psychomotor skills in overcoming the fulcrum-effect. Despite the widespread use of this procedure, current qualified hysteroscopy surgeons have not been trained the fundamentals through an organised curriculum. The emergence of virtual reality as an educational tool for this procedure, and for other endoscopic procedures, has undoubtedly raised interests. The ultimate objective is for the inclusion of virtual reality training as a mandatory component for gynaecologic endoscopy training. Part of this process involves the design of a simulator, encompassing the technical difficulties and complications associated with the procedure. The proposed research examines fundamental hysteroscopy factors, current training and accreditation, and proposes a hysteroscopic simulator design that is suitable for educating and training."

It was thus introduced for the exploration of female stress urinary incontinence at the beginning of the 1980s. Various techniques and parameters of ultrasound examination have been used for the assessment of bladder neck mobility. The aim of this literature review was to suggest the adequate ultrasound technique to study bladder neck mobility. We reviewed articles indexed in MEDLINE dealing with urogenital ultrasound and published between 1998 and 2008. The bladder-symphysis distance measured by transperineal ultrasound is a reliable and reproductive tool to study female stress urinary incontinence. Despite a lack of standardization of Valsalva manoeuvre, normal bladder neck mobility is estimated between 15 and 20 mm. Furthermore, in case of complications from stress urinary incontinence surgery, ultrasound is considered as the first line imaging test. Perineal ultrasound is an interesting investigation for preoperative assessment of stress urinary incontinence or in case of surgery failure or complications.

CD011126,0,17080813,0,Lines of curvature for polyp detection in virtual colonoscopy.,"Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is a helpful addition to laborious visual inspection for preselection of suspected colonic polyps in virtual colonoscopy. Most of the previous work on automatic polyp detection makes use of indicators based on the scalar curvature of the colon wall and can result in many false-positive detections. Our work tries to reduce the number of false-positive detections in the preselection of polyp candidates. Polyp surface shape can be characterized and visualized using lines of curvature. In this paper, we describe techniques for generating and rendering lines of curvature on surfaces and we show that these lines can be used as part of a polyp detection approach. We have adapted existing approaches on explicit triangular surface meshes, and developed a new algorithm on implicit surfaces embedded in 3D volume data. The visualization of shaded colonic surfaces can be enhanced by rendering the derived lines of curvature on these surfaces. Features strongly correlated with true-positive detections were calculated on lines of curvature and used for the polyp candidate selection. We studied the performance of these features on 5 data sets that included 331 pre-detected candidates, of which 50 sites were true polyps. The winding angle had a significant discriminating power for true-positive detections, which was demonstrated by a Wilcoxon rank sum test with p < 0.001. The median winding angle and inter-quartile range (IQR) for true polyps were 7.817 and 6.770 - 9.288 compared to 2.954 and 1.995 - 3.749 for false-positive detections."

CD011126,0,17080810,0,A pipeline for computer aided polyp detection.,"We present a novel pipeline for computer-aided detection (CAD) of colonic polyps by integrating texture and shape analysis with volume rendering and conformal colon flattening. Using our automatic method, the 3D polyp detection problem is converted into a 2D pattern recognition problem. The colon surface is first segmented and extracted from the CT data set of the patient's abdomen, which is then mapped to a 2D rectangle using conformal mapping. This flattened image is rendered using a direct volume rendering technique with a translucent electronic biopsy transfer function. The polyps are detected by a 2D clustering method on the flattened image. The false positives are further reduced by analyzing the volumetric shape and texture features. Compared with shape based methods, our method is much more efficient without the need of computing curvature and other shape parameters for the whole colon surface. The final detection results are stored in the 2D image, which can be easily incorporated into a virtual colonoscopy (VC) system to highlight the polyp locations. The extracted colon surface mesh can be used to accelerate the volumetric ray casting algorithm used to generate the VC endoscopic view. The proposed automatic CAD pipeline is incorporated into an interactive VC system, with a goal of helping radiologists detect polyps faster and with higher accuracy."

This has been due to the development of new, technologically advanced computer planning systems and treatment delivery techniques. Modern, three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities have been incorporated into treatment planning methods, allowing full 3D dose distributions to be computed. Treatment techniques involving online planning have emerged, allowing dose distributions to be calculated and updated in real time based on the actual clinical situation. In the case of early stage breast cancer treatment, for example, electronic brachytherapy treatment techniques are being used in which the radiation dose is delivered during the same procedure as the surgery. There have also been significant advances in treatment applicator design, which allow the use of modern 3D imaging techniques for planning, and manufacturers have begun to implement new dose calculation algorithms that will correct for applicator shielding and tissue inhomogeneities. This article aims to review the recent developments and best practice in brachytherapy techniques and treatments. It will look at how imaging developments have been incorporated into current brachytherapy treatment and how these developments have played an integral role in the modern brachytherapy era. The planning requirements for different treatments sites are reviewed as well as the future developments of brachytherapy in radiobiology and treatment planning dose calculation."

CD011126,0,19921645,0,The phenotypic spectrum of contiguous deletion of CYP21A2 and tenascin XB: quadricuspid aortic valve and other midline defects.,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder and is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in the newborn. The genes encoding 21-hydroxylase, CYP21A2, and tenascin-X (TNX), TNXB, are located within the HLA complex, in a region of high gene density termed the RCCX module. The module has multiple pseudogenes as well as tandem repeat sequences that promote misalignment during meiosis leading to complex gene rearrangements, deletions and gene conversion events. CYP21A2 mutations cause CAH, and TNX deficiency has been identified as a cause of hypermobility type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Here we report on a three-generation family with a heterozygous deletion encompassing CYP21A2 and TNXB that initially came to medical attention due to the diagnosis of CAH in the proposita. Southern blotting and PCR-based analysis of the RCCX module revealed a CYP21A2 deletion extending into TNXB in one allele and a CYP21A2 point mutation in the other allele. Family history is notable for joint hypermobility. Additional radiological and clinical investigations showed a quadricuspid aortic valve, single kidney, bicornuate uterus and a bifid uvula in the proposita, and mitral valve prolapse in her mother. These findings further delineate the phenotype of the CAH-TNX contiguous gene deletion syndrome and point to an intersection of connective tissue dysplasias with a common gene-mediated endocrine disorder."

Our aim was to determine the effect of participant selection on prevalence and treatment suitability. Men aged 65 to 75 years attending cardiology clinics composed the high-risk group; the control group was from the community. AAA screening was performed, with follow-up or surgery arranged. Four hundred eight of 651 (62.7%) high-risk men and 109 of 908 (45.0%; p< .0001) men attended from the community. In the high-risk patients, 40 AAAs were diagnosed, with a mean diameter of 41.4 mm (+/-10.4 mm). In the control group, 22 new AAAs were found, with an average size of 40.9 mm (+/-10.4 mm). Higher polypharmacy existed in the high-risk group (4.6+/-2.2 vs 2.3+/-2.0; p< .0001). More aneurysm patients were on dual-antiplatelet therapy (32.5% vs 15.4%; p= .048) compared with the overall high-risk group. In this group, three underwent surgery; one was anatomically unsuitable for endovascular repair and medically unfit for open repair. Two in the control group had surgery. A higher prevalence of AAA is encountered in high-risk men. Most aneurysms are small; however, a significant proportion of the aneurysms detected were of a size that would warrant repair. The decision to perform surgical repair is likely to be influenced by the comorbid medical conditions, which placed the patients in the high-risk category."
CD011126,0,22022379,0,Conditionally replicating adenovirus expressing TIMP2 increases survival in a mouse model of disseminated ovarian cancer.,"Ovarian cancer remains difficult to treat mainly due to presentation of the disease at an advanced stage. Conditionally-replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) are promising anti-cancer agents that selectively kill the tumor cells. The present study evaluated the efficacy of a novel CRAd (Ad5/3-CXCR4-TIMP2) containing the CXCR4 promoter for selective viral replication in cancer cells together with TIMP2 as a therapeutic transgene, targeting the matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in a murine orthotopic model of disseminated ovarian cancer. An orthotopic model of ovarian cancer was established in athymic nude mice by intraperitonal injection of the human ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV3-Luc, expressing luciferase. Upon confirmation of peritoneal dissemination of the cells by non-invasive imaging, mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups: PBS, Ad-ΔE1-TIMP2, Ad5/3-CXCR4, and Ad5/3-CXCR4-TIMP2. All mice were imaged weekly to monitor tumor growth and were sacrificed upon reaching any of the predefined endpoints, including high tumor burden and significant weight loss along with clinical evidence of pain and distress. Survival analysis was performed using the Log-rank test. The median survival for the PBS cohort was 33 days; for Ad-ΔE1-TIMP2, 39 days; for Ad5/3-CXCR4, 52.5 days; and for Ad5/3-CXCR4-TIMP2, 63 days. The TIMP2-armed CRAd delayed tumor growth and significantly increased survival when compared to the unarmed CRAd. This therapeutic effect was confirmed to be mediated through inhibition of MMP9. Results of the in vivo study support the translational potential of Ad5/3-CXCR4-TIMP2 for treatment of human patients with advanced ovarian cancer."

CD011126,0,23668063,0,[Huge uterine leiomyoma with degenerative changes mimicking ovarian carcinoma--a case report].,"Leiomyomas are the most common benign uterine tumors. Although 20-40% of all women in reproductive age may have uterine leiomyomas, they are not very common in pregnancy. Only 0.3-2.6% af all pregnant women are diagnosed with leiomyomas. The leiomyomas are symptomatic in 20-50% of all cases. Clinical symptoms are usually excessive or irregular menstrual bleeding, problems resulting from adjacent organs pressure, sterility miscarriage or problems during the labour. Leiomyomas are known to have estrogen receptors and can demonstrate an extensive growth in high estrogens concentration environment. During the pregnancy they can grow, stay the same size or as well decrease. Rapid leiomyoma's growth, caused by its transformation into sarcoma, takes place in about 0.1-0.8% of all cases. In this article we present a case of patient with leiomyoma, which rapid growth, which imitated ovarian tumor. A 40-year old patient was admitted to the 1st Department of Obstretrics and Gynecology Medical University of Warsaw, in May 2012 because of a large abdominal tumor. She had four vaginal deliveries and one cesarean section. The patients delivered three months before admission. Since the labour she had suffered from dysuria and noticed a quick waits enlargement. On admission the patient was in good general condition, without any stomachache. A giant tumor in her lower and middle abdomen was found. The tumor reached three fingers above the navel. In the ultrasound scan a large solid-cystic the tumor with moderate vascularization was described. It looked like the ovarian neoplasm. The CA-125 plasma concentration was 389,5 IU/ml. After giving a written informed consent the patient had an operation. During the operation a solid-cystic peducled uterine tumor was diagnosed. The diameter of the tumor was about 25 cm. The uterine and uterine appendages had no pathological macroscopic changes. Intraoperative histopathological examination was carried out and revealed mesenchymal tumor without evident polymorphism or mitosis. Because of lack of any signs of malignancy during the operation only the tumor with its peduncle was removed. The patient was discharged in good general condition after three day of postoperative hospitalization. The final histopathological examination revealed leiomyoma with cystic degeneration changes. A small focus of necrosis and extravasation was found. 4 weeks after the operation there were no abnormalities in the gynecological examination and the CA-125 concentration was 27 IU/ml. The presented case illustrates diagnostic difficulties, which may occur when atypical rapid tumor enlargement and its ultrasound image and laboratory tests results imitate ovarian tumor."

CD011126,0,1426498,0,Hysteroscopic diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.,"Although vaginal ultrasonography combined with plasma beta-hCG determination can provide a reliable diagnosis and location of ectopic pregnancy, the results can be difficult to interpret in the early stages when hCG levels are low. Hysteroscopy can be used in such cases to differentiate between ectopic pregnancy and non-viable uterine pregnancy when viable uterine pregnancy has been ruled out. General anaesthesia and laparoscopy are avoided. We performed 60 hysteroscopic procedures between January 1989 and December 1990 in patients with suspected ectopic pregnancies. The pregnancy had been located by means of vaginal ultrasonography in every case in which the hCG was above 1500 IU/ml and in 36% of cases in which the beta-hCG was below this level. Hysteroscopy was hindered by metrorrhagia in three cases and was inconclusive in one, necessitating laparoscopy. Diagnosis was possible in all the remaining cases, as follows: ectopic pregnancy in 41 cases, with an empty uterus and occasional bleeding from an ostium; non-viable uterine pregnancy in 18 cases, with the presence of material within the cavity. Hysteroscopy therefore confirmed the diagnosis in 55% of the cases and was itself diagnostic in a further 43% of cases. Its sensitivity for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was 100% and its specificity 95%. We propose a diagnostic decision tree."

CD011126,0,18794312,0,Pearls and pitfalls in diagnosis of ovarian torsion.,"Ovarian torsion is defined as partial or complete rotation of the ovarian vascular pedicle and causes obstruction to venous outflow and arterial inflow. Ovarian torsion is usually associated with a cyst or tumor, which is typically benign; the most common is mature cystic teratoma. Ultrasonography (US) is the primary imaging modality for evaluation of ovarian torsion. US features of ovarian torsion include a unilateral enlarged ovary, uniform peripheral cystic structures, a coexistent mass within the affected ovary, free pelvic fluid, lack of arterial or venous flow, and a twisted vascular pedicle. The presence of flow at color Doppler imaging does not allow exclusion of torsion but instead suggests that the ovary may be viable, especially if flow is present centrally. Absence of flow in the twisted vascular pedicle may indicate that the ovary is not viable. The role of computed tomography (CT) has expanded, and it is increasingly used in evaluation of abdominal pain. Common CT features of ovarian torsion include an enlarged ovary, uterine deviation to the twisted side, smooth wall thickening of the twisted adnexal cystic mass, fallopian tube thickening, peripheral cystic structures, and ascites. Understanding the imaging appearance of ovarian torsion will lead to conservative, ovary-sparing treatment."

Serum β-human chronic gonadotropin was 33,492 IU/L. At laparoscopy a mass attached to right ovary, suggestive of a right ovarian ectopic pregnancy, was excised. Histological examination confirmed an ovarian ectopic gestation, but noted enlarged chorionic villi and trophoblastic atypia, which raised the suspicion of molar pregnancy.

CD011126,0,19762262,0,[Three-dimensional brachytherapy optimization techniques in the treatment of patients with cervix cancer].,"Traditionally, prescription and treatment planning in intracavitary brachytherapy for cervix cancer have used either reference points (mainly points A and B) or reference isodoses (60Gy according to ICRU recommendations) to report doses to the target volume. Doses to critical organs were reported at bladder and rectum ICRU points. This practice has been supported by a long-standing clinical experience that has yielded an acceptable therapeutic ratio. The recent development of imaging has contributed to the improvement in target and organs at risk knowledge. In 2005 and 2006, GEC-ESTRO recommendations publications on 3-D based image brachytherapy have defined the different volumes of interest. These recommendations have been validated with intercomparison delineation studies. With the concomitant development of remote after-loading projectors, provided with miniaturized sources, it is now possible to plan radiation doses by adjusting dwell positions and relative dwell time values. These procedures allow better coverage of the targets while sparing OAR. The recent literature data evidence a significant improvement in local control with no increase in complications. Further studies are needed to better define the dose recommended in both tumour and organs at risk. This is one of the goals of the European study on MRI-guided brachytherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer (EMBRACE) protocol."

CD011126,0,15634726,0,Do polycystic ovaries on ultrasound scan indicate decreased insulin sensitivity in sisters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome?,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with hyperandrogenemia, insulin resistance, altered lipid profile, and therefore with subsequently increased risk for metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. It has been reported that sisters of probands with PCOS, who themselves had PCOS or hyperandrogenemia with normal menses, were more insulin resistant than unaffected sisters. We have previously reported that 60% of first-degree relatives (premenopausal mothers and sisters) of PCOS probands had polycystic ovaries (PCO) on ultrascan. Sisters with PCO were more likely to have oligomenorrhea and increased androgen levels than sisters without PCO. The aims of this study were to assess insulin sensitivity status [homeostasis model of assessment, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, glucose to insulin ratio (G/I)] and lipid profiles in probands with PCOS and their sisters with PCO and without PCO on ultrascan. Mixed model hierarchical regression analysis, to accommodate the nonindependent nature of the subjects (family relationships), with the three groups together did not show significant differences in insulin sensitivity, calculated as quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, homeostasis model of assessment, and G/I for PCOS probands, through sisters with PCO on ultrascan, to sisters without PCO on ultrascan. There was a significant association of measures of insulin sensitivity with body mass index. Lipid parameters did not differ between the groups. These data suggest that presence of PCO on ultrasound scan per se does not predispose to reduced insulin sensitivity in sisters of women with PCOS. Because about 20% of premenopausal women in the general population have PCO on ultrascan, and obesity/overweight is becoming more prevalent, it is important that future studies take full account of the contribution made by obesity to risk factors for metabolic/vascular complications."

CD011126,0,22939241,0,Therapeutic management of uterine fibroid tumors: updated French guidelines.,"The medical management of symptomatic non-submucosal uterine fibroid tumors (leiomyomas or myomas) is based on the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding by any of the following: progestogens, a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, tranexamic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or GnRH analogs. Selective progesterone receptor modulators are currently being evaluated and have recently been approved for fibroid treatment. Neither combined estrogen-progestogen contraception nor hormone treatment of the menopause is contraindicated in women with fibroids. When pregnancy is desired, whether or not infertility is being treated by assisted reproductive technology, hysteroscopic resection in one or two separate procedures of submucosal fibroids less than 4 cm in length is recommended, regardless of whether they are symptomatic. Interstitial, also known as intramural, fibroids have a negative effect on fertility but treating them does not improve fertility. Myomectomy is therefore indicated only for symptomatic fibroids; depending on their size and number, and may be performed by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Physicians must explain to women the potential consequences of myomas and myomectomy on future pregnancy. For perimenopausal women who have been informed of the alternatives and the risks, hysterectomy is the most effective treatment for symptomatic fibroids and is associated with a high rate of patient satisfaction. When possible, the vaginal or laparoscopic routes should be preferred to laparotomy for hysterectomies for fibroids considered typical on imaging. Because uterine artery embolization is an effective treatment with low long-term morbidity, it is an option for symptomatic fibroids in women who do not want to become pregnant, and a validated alternative to myomectomy and hysterectomy that must be offered to patients. Myolysis is under assessment, and research on its use is recommended. Isolated laparoscopic ligation of the uterine arteries is a potential alternative to uterine artery embolization; it also complements myomectomy by reducing intraoperative bleeding. It is possible to use second-generation techniques of endometrial ablation to treat submucosal fibroids in women whose families are complete. Subtotal hysterectomy is a possible alternative to total hysterectomy for fibroid treatment, given that by laparotomy the former has a lower complication rate than the latter, while by laparoscopy, these rates are the same. In each case, the patient is informed about the benefit and risk associated with each therapeutic option."

Besides the primary reason that is manifested in the total cure of the patients, the secondary reason represents the decrease of costs of treatment of congenital anomalies of the uterus. Both descriptive and analytical methods were used in this paper. In 1997 Kurjak and Kupesic compared the sensitivity and specificity of transvaginal ultra sound, color Doppler, hysterosonography and three-dimensional ultrasound during diagnosis of the uterus septum. Representation of pathological findings in our paper in comparison to the examined group is: uterus subseptus = 15.38%, double horned uterus = 10.25%. The examined group includes intrauterine abnormalities of the uterus, analyzing, in that process, individual, pathological entities of intrauterine abnormalities. The research is a prospective, target, clinical study. In the examined group, due to the clinical suspicion of intrauterine abnormalities, 78 patients were examined in the following manner: two-dimensional transabdominal and transvaginal black-and-white and color Doppler ultrasound examinations were made and then three-dimensional transabdominal black-and-white and color Doppler ultrasound examinations. This means that in the detection of congenital anomalies of the uterus, the same sonographic techniques were first applied on the conventional and then also on the multidimensional base. Our research showed that three-dimensional technique is a more reliable diagnostic tool than two-dimensional technique. Sensitivity and specificity rate as well as positive predictive value show that this technique is an extraordinary one for assessing the volume, and position of congenital abnormalities."

Understanding the nature of landmark curves to the whole surface structure is meaningful but it remains challenging and open. In this work, we present a novel and effective colon flattening method based on quasiconformal mapping, which straightens the main anatomical landmark curves with least conformality (angle) distortion. It provides a canonical and straightforward view of the long, convoluted and folded tubular colon surface. The computation is based on the holomorphic 1-form method with landmark straightening constraints and quasiconformal optimization, and has linear time complexity due to the linearity of 1-forms in each iteration. Experiments on various colon data demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our algorithm and its practicability for polyp detection and findings visualization; furthermore, the result reveals the geometric characteristics of anatomical landmarks on colon surfaces."

Here we report a patient with UAP possibly caused by septic abortion. She had high fever and bleeding with positive urine pregnancy test. We diagnosed this condition as septic abortion. Ultrasound revealed an intrauterine echogenic mass and color Doppler revealed swirling blood flow within the mass. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a heterogeneously enhanced intrauterine mass. Selective internal iliac artery angiography revealed contrast medium within the mass immediately after medium injection. Bilateral uterine artery embolization was performed, after which medium no longer accumulated in the uterus, and hemostasis was achieved, confirming the diagnosis as UAP. Antibiotic treatment ameliorated the infection and the uterine content was expelled and absorbed. UAP can occur even without preceding procedures and may manifest abortive, and not postpartum, hemorrhage. UAP may be hidden behind septic abortion."

PCOS has not been as extensively investigated in the adolescent population. The objectives of our study were to further characterize early endocrine and metabolic alterations in adolescents with PCOS and to determine whether differences between nonobese and obese women with PCOS are present early in its course. We studied an ethnically heterogeneous group of 48 adolescents: 11 nonobese with PCOS [age, 16.1 +/- 1.9 yr; body mass index (BMI), 22.5 +/- 1.5 kg/m(2)], 22 obese with PCOS (age, 15.5 +/- 1.4 yr; BMI, 35.9 +/- 6.2 kg/m(2)), and 15 obese controls (age, 14.4 +/- 1.5 yr; BMI, 35.8 +/- 7.1 kg/m(2)). Fasting levels of glucose, insulin, proinsulin, hemoglobin A1c, testosterone, SHBG, Delta4-androstenedione (Delta4-A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), LH, FSH, IGF-I, IGF binding protein-1, free IGF-I, and lipids were measured. Six of the 11 nonobese PCOS subjects, 11 of the 22 obese PCOS subjects, and six of the 15 controls underwent standard oral glucose tolerance testing. The insulin response to the oral glucose tolerance test was measured by the insulin area under the curve (I(AUC120)). Measures of insulin sensitivity were calculated as the fasting glucose to insulin ratio, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and composite insulin sensitivity index. The nonobese adolescents with PCOS demonstrated higher levels of LH, SHBG, Delta4-A, DHEAS, dihydrotestosterone, free IGF-I, and high-density lipoprotein, and lower low-density lipoprotein, compared with the obese PCOS group. Fasting levels of insulin and proinsulin, I(AUC120), and log I(AUC120) were higher, and the fasting glucose to insulin ratio, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and composite insulin sensitivity index were lower in the obese compared with the nonobese PCOS subjects. Greater levels of LH and androgens, including total and free testosterone, Delta4-A, and DHEAS, and lower SHBG levels were found in the obese PCOS group compared with the obese controls. Adolescents with PCOS manifest clinical, metabolic, and endocrine features similar to those of adult women, and differences between nonobese and obese women with PCOS may be detected in adolescence. Our findings indicate a more pronounced alteration in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in nonobese adolescents with PCOS and a more marked dysregulation of insulin levels and impairment of insulin sensitivity in their obese counterparts. Our data also suggest differences in the IGF system between nonobese and obese adolescents with PCOS."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has a wide clinical spectrum that often includes heart failure symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CA 125 in HCM patients, its relation to severity of symptoms, and degree of diastolic dysfunction. CA 125 blood levels were determined in 32 HCM patients (21 male; age 51.3 +/- 18.4 years) and in 30 healthy volunteers (19 male; age 49.6 +/- 16.1 years). Echocardiographic examinations were performed in all patients. The results were grouped according to clinical status (New York Heart Association class) of the patients. The mean serum level of CA 125 was 14.6 +/- 23.8 U/ml in the study group and 7.6 +/- 4.8 U/ml in the control group. There was no significant difference between the groups (P = 0.12). CA 125 levels increased as the New York Heart Association functional class increased (class I/II: 6.2 +/- 2.4 U/ml; class III: 30.6 +/- 36.4 U/ml; P < 0.001). The mean CA 125 level in functional class III patients (30.6 +/- 36.4 U/ml) was significantly higher than that of the control group (7.6 +/- 4.8 U/ml) (P < 0.001) and the functional class I/II group (6.2 +/- 2.4 U/ml) (P < 0.001). There was a significant difference over all three diastolic dysfunction groups with respect to CA 125 levels (4.9 +/- 1.3 U/ml in impaired relaxation group, 11.8 +/- 6.9 U/ml in pseudonormal group, and 52.6 +/- 45.6 U/ml in restrictive filling group; P < 0.0001).

CD011126,0,23366807,0,Segmentation of small bowel tumor tissue in capsule endoscopy images by using the MAP algorithm.,"State of the art algorithms for diagnosis of the small bowel by using capsule endoscopic images usually rely on the processing of the whole frame, hence no segmentation is usually required. However, some specific applications such as three-dimensional reconstruction of the digestive wall, detection of small substructures such as polyps and ulcers or training of young medical staff require robust segmentation. Current state of the art algorithms for robust segmentation are mainly based on Markov Random Fields (MRF) requiring prohibitive computational resources not compatible with applications that generate a great amount of data as is the case of capsule endoscopy. However context information given by MRF is not the only way to improve robustness. Alternatives could come from a more effective use of the color information. This paper proposes a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) based approach for lesion segmentation based on pixel intensities read simultaneously in the three color channels. Usually tumor regions are characterized by higher intensity than normal regions, where the intensity can be measured as the vectorial sum of the 3 color channels. The exception occurs when the capsule is positioned perpendicularly and too close to the small bowel wall. In this case a hipper intense tissue region appears at the middle of the image, which in case of being normal tissue, will be segmented as tumor tissue. This paper also proposes a Maximum Likelihood (ML) based approach to deal with this situation. Experimental results show that tumor segmentation becomes more effective in the HSV than in the RGB color space where diagonal covariance matrices have similar effectiveness than full covariance matrices."

The new formulas allow control of the spatial resolution of the motif ranging from low-resolution spherically symmetric motifs as in Cochran et al. through moderate-resolution nonsymmetrical motifs to atomic-resolution nonsymmetrical motifs which can also be treated by the methods of Cochran et al. as a superposition of spherically symmetric atomic motifs.

CD011126,0,20231123,0,Consensus on 3D treatment planning in gynaecologic brachytherapy of the Radiation Oncology Spanish Society (SEOR) Brachytherapy Group.,"Gynaecologic brachytherapy (BT) is a fundamental part of the treatment of gynaecologic carcinomas, especially if it is not possible to perform surgery. Traditionally, low-dose-rate BT and planning by orthogonal X-rays have been used. Nowadays, high-dose-rate BT is available in most centres, enabling it to enhance the dose optimisation, radiation protection and comfort of patients. Technical advantages in image and dosimetry have enabled the switch to CT and MRI as a means to define the tumour and the organs at risk, and to perform realistic anatomical-based planning. However a general consensus about the way the dose should be prescribed has not yet been reached. Some centres still use the Manchester points A as the reference to specify the dose. It was imperative to work towards a consensus and for this reason the VII Consensus Meeting of the Radiation Oncology Spanish Society (SEOR) Brachytherapy Group was organised. We agreed that some imaging system, CT or MRI, rather than the traditional system with orthogonal X-rays, should always be used for treatment planning. The dose should be prescribed by volume instead of points. And the given dose should be reported by adding external beam radiotherapy dose and BT dose as EQD2 (isoeffective dose). Caution is also recommended in changing the mode of planning and prescription, taking into account previous experience with points A."
CD011126,0,15569700,0,"Fertility in female cancer survivors: pathophysiology, preservation and the role of ovarian reserve testing.","The improved long-term survival of adolescents and young women treated for cancer has resulted in an increased focus on the effects of chemotherapy on ovarian function and its preservation. These women may seek advice and treatment regarding their reproductive status, including ways of preserving their fertility and preventing a premature menopause--factors that can have a profound impact on their quality of life. This article comprehensively reviews ovarian reserve testing (ORT) in general. Special emphasis is placed on patients with cancer, including the pathophysiology of gonadal damage following chemotherapy, fertility preservation and the potential role of ORT. Baseline parameters of ovarian reserve [FSH LH, estradiol, inhibin B and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)] have not yet performed sufficiently well in predicting poor outcome in assisted reproduction, but biochemical markers of ovarian reserve appear to be better than chronological age. Inhibin B and AMH show potential for future use. Dynamic testing appears to show much promise, especially stimulated levels of inhibin B and estradiol. The most promising tests of ovarian reserve are the biophysical markers, where total antral follicle count was found to be most discriminatory followed by ovarian volume. Combination of biochemical, biophysical and clinical markers of ovarian reserve may also improve predictive capacity. However, there is a lack of data pertinent to ORT in cancer. As yet there is no single clinically useful test to predict ovarian reserve accurately. Patients with cancer represent a distinct cohort who have particular concerns about their future fertility and the possibility of a premature menopause, they can benefit greatly from knowledge of their functional ovarian reserve. Large, prospective, randomized, adequately controlled studies specific to different geographical areas are required in a control population of comparable reproductive age to determine the potential role of ORT in clinical practice."
CD011126,0,16364691,0,Familial ovarian cancer screening.,"Familial predisposition accounts for approximately 10% of epithelial ovarian cancer. Identification and management of at-risk families is therefore an important area that bridges gynaecological and clinical genetic practice. The efficacy of screening for ovarian cancer in both high- and low-risk populations is currently of unproven benefit and is associated with some risks related to false-positive results. In contrast to the general population, preventive surgery is a realistic proposition for many women at high-risk. Although prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy prevents ovarian and tubal cancer and reduces the risk of breast cancer, this option is unsuitable for women who have yet to complete their families or who are unwilling to undergo surgery. There is therefore a continued demand for screening in the high-risk population. This chapter discusses the limitations of screening, the circumstances under which screening is appropriate and current screening guidelines. Ongoing and future research that should help to provide additional information about this area is also reviewed."
CD011126,0,16364690,0,Screening for ovarian cancer in the general population.,"Screening for ovarian cancer in the general population presents several unique challenges. Without a clearly identified premalignant state, efforts have focused on detection of early stage disease. Towards this end, investigators have focused on the use of serum markers and transvaginal ultrasound. CA125 determination is the most reliable serum marker in use, and utilization of serial measurements to calculate risk of cancer appears to have greater utility than evaluation of a single value. Multimodality screening focuses on combining serial CA125 measurement with transvaginal ultrasound follow-up for those with abnormal values. Large prospective trials, such as the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), are currently underway to assess the impact of various screening strategies on mortality, and to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and morbidity of screening. Future research efforts will undoubtedly focus on promising techniques to examine the serum proteosome for patterns to identify early ovarian cancer."
CD011126,0,23216335,0,Platelet-derived microparticles in overweight/obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome.,"A substantial proportion of women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are obese and obesity is considered as a prothrombotic state. Platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) might be implicated in the activation of the coagulation cascade. We aimed to assess plasma PMPs in overweight/obese women with PCOS. We measured plasma PMPs and determined anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal and ultrasonographic features of PCOS in 67 overweight/obese women with PCOS (with body mass index [BMI] >25.0 kg/m²) and in 21 BMI-matched healthy women. Circulating androgens and markers of insulin resistance (IR) were higher in women with PCOS than in controls. Plasma PMPs were also higher in women with PCOS than in controls (p = 0.046). In women with PCOS, plasma PMPs correlated with the mean number of follicles in the ovaries (r = 0.343; p = 0.006). In controls, plasma PMPs did not correlate with any of the studied parameters. In conclusion, plasma PMPs are elevated in overweight/obese women with PCOS compared with BMI-matched controls. The cause of this increase is unclear but both IR and hyperandrogenemia might be implicated. More studies are required to elucidate the pathogenesis of the elevation of PMPs in PCOS and to assess its implications on the cardiovascular risk of these patients."

CD011126,0,22806624,0,Ultrasound detection of colonic polyps: perspective.,"Colorectal cancer is often preventable if the precursor adenoma is detected and removed. Although ultrasound is clearly not one of the widely accepted screening techniques, this non-invasive and radiation-free modality is also capable of detecting colonic polyps, both benign and malignant. Such colon lesions may be encountered when not expected, usually during general abdominal sonography. The discovery of large colonic polyps is important and can potentially help reduce the incidence of a common cancer, whereas detection of a malignant polyp at an early stage may result in a curative intervention. This pictorial review highlights our experience of sonographic detection of colonic polyps in 43 adult patients encountered at our institutions over a 2-year period. 4 out of 50 discovered polyps were found to be malignant lesions, 3 polyps were hyperplastic, 1 polyp was a hamartomatous polyp and the rest were benign adenomas. The smallest of the detected polyps was 1.3 cm in diameter, the largest one was 4.0 cm (mean 1.7 cm; median 1.6 cm). In each case, polyps were discovered during a routine abdominal or pelvic examination, particularly when scanning was supplemented by a brief focused sonographic inspection of the colon with a 6-10 MHz linear transducer. In this paper, we illustrate the key sonographic features of different types of commonly encountered colonic polyps in the hope of encouraging more observers to detect these lesions, which may be subtle."

However, there is considerable confusion in understanding and managing the natural course of each condition due to a lack of uniform terminology. The single most important factor for differentiating these types of pregnancies is to make an early diagnosis. The differences between interstitial, angular, and cornual pregnancies on 2-dimensional (2D) sonography are subtle. Although magnetic resonance imaging can be used to differentiate these conditions, it is not preferred as the initial assessment tool because of its limited availability and cost-effectiveness. Three-dimensional (3D) sonography has the advantage of providing views of the uterus that cannot be obtained with conventional 2D sonography. We describe 3 cases of interstitial, angular, and intrauterine pregnancies in a septate uterus that were clearly differentiated by 3D sonography. We demonstrate the differences in diagnostic imaging findings and emphasize the importance of 3D sonography in differentiating these entities."

Cardiac rhabdomyomas may be completely asymptomatic and are incidentally discovered during an echocardiogram, or may cause cardiac dysfunctions requiring medical and/or surgical intervention. During foetal life and the early neonatal period, life-threatening conditions, mostly due to arrhythmias, cardiac failure or obstruction, do occur on rare occasions. We reviewed the medical records of all cases of cardiac rhabdomyomas diagnosed prenatally or postnatally over an 8-year period. The present study reviews 7 cases of life-threatening conditions. Arrhythmic episodes were described in 5 patients, and blood flow obstruction was reported in 2 cases. Antiarrhythmic agents successfully controlled the clinical and electrophysiological conditions. Obstructive conditions were associated with poor outcomes. In conclusion, when prenatal diagnosis of rhabdomyoma is made, appropriate planning at delivery for the management of potential haemodynamic complications may prevent adverse neonatal outcomes. The clinical outcome is more influenced by obstructive rather than by dysrhythmic complications. Appropriate antiarrhythmic treatment is of primary importance. In all cases discovered through prenatal and/or neonatal life-threatening conditions, an accurate follow-up should always be performed to anticipate the development of tuberous sclerosis."

The diagnosis is integrated by clinical, laboratory and ultrasound evaluation. In particular, the ultrasound criteria were published in 1999. The aim of this study was to analyse the sensitivity and specificity of additional diagnostic ultrasound criteria as well as of conventional criteria in a selected category of infertile patients with MAGI. To accomplish this, 100 patients with MAGI were evaluated by scrotal and transrectal ultrasound by three different operators. The control group consisted of 100 age-matched healthy men. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and ROC curve analysis. The results showed that additional ultrasound criteria had a diagnostic accuracy similar to traditional criteria. The threshold value of two criteria for each diagnostic category (traditional and additional criteria) obtained high values of sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, this study confirms the validity of the ultrasound criteria of MAGI previously published; in addition, it suggests the clinical utility of other indicators in clinical practice with good diagnostic accuracy and finally it establishes a clear threshold ultrasonographic value for the diagnosis of MAGI."

CD011126,0,18156977,0,"Endometrial microcalcifications detected by ultrasonography: clinical associations, histopathology, and potential etiology.","Endometrial microcalcifications are uncommon, with alleged clinical implications ranging from innocuous to ominous. We reviewed the histopathologic slides from 29 patients who had endometrial echogenic foci on pelvic ultrasound and found many endometrial microcalcifications. The extent of microcalcifications in each specimen was graded on a semiquantitative scale from 0 to 3. The mean patient age was 54 years (range, 34-81 years). The specimens included endometrial biopsies, curettages, and hysterectomies. Most of the patients had presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Fifteen patients (51.7%) were postmenopausal, 10 (34.5%) were premenopausal, and the rest were perimenopausal. The most frequent endometrial types were atrophic (39.5%), inactive (23.3%), and proliferative (14%). Six specimens (14%) showed benign endometrial polyps. One patient had well-differentiated endometrioid carcinoma of the endometrium without myometrial invasion. Specimens from 16 patients (55.2%) had microcalcifications. The patients with calcifications were older than those without calcifications (mean age, 60 vs. 47 years, respectively; P = 0.017). The extent of microcalcifications positively correlated with the presence of endometrial polyps (P = 0.00076), postmenopausal state (P = 0.004), atrophic endometrium (P = 0.002), and hormone replacement therapy (P = 0.013). The microcalcifications were concentric or amorphous, intraglandular or stromal. They were focally associated with minute papillary epithelial projections or with degenerated endometrial glands. Follow-up was available on 26 patients (89.7%). Except for the patient with endometrioid carcinoma, none has developed uterine, adnexal, or peritoneal malignancy. In summary, endometrial microcalcifications are histologically heterogeneous and are associated with older patient age, postmenopausal state, atrophic endometrium, and endometrial polyps. Those found incidentally by means of pelvic ultrasonography, in our experience, did not portend malignancy."

The goal of this study was to explore the clinical value of combining two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal contrast-enhanced ultrasounds (CEUS) in diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma (EC). Methods. In this prospective diagnostic study, transvaginal 2D and 3D CEUS were performed on 68 patients with suspected EC, and the results of the obtained 2D-CEUS and 3D-CEUS images were compared with the gold standard for statistical analysis. Results. 2D-CEUS benign endometrial lesions showed the normal uterine perfusion phase while EC cases showed early arrival and early washout of the contrast agent and nonuniform enhancement. The 3D-CEUS images differed in central blood vessel manifestation, blood vessel shape, and vascular pattern between benign and malignant endometrial lesions (P < 0.05). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of transvaginal 2D-CEUS and 2D-CEUS combined with 3D-CEUS for diagnosis of benign and malignant endometrial lesions were 76.9%, 73.8%, 64.5%, 83.8%, and 75.0% and 84.6%, 83.3%, 75.9%, 89.7%, and 83.8%, respectively. Conclusion. 3D-CEUS is a useful supplement to 2D-CEUS and can clearly reveal the angioarchitecture spatial relationships between vessels and depth of myometrial invasion in EC. The combined use of 2D and 3D-CEUS can offer direct, accurate, and comprehensive diagnosis of early EC."
CD011126,0,15320904,0,"Effect of tamoxifen on serum IL-18, vascular endothelial growth factor and nitric oxide activities in breast carcinoma patients.","Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a multi-functional cytokine that has been suggested to be a major angiogenic factor in breast cancer. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent biological molecule that participates in the multi-step process of carcinogenesis. Interleukin (IL)-18 has been shown to have potent anti-tumour effects. In this study, we investigated the effect of tamoxifen therapy on serum VEGF, NO and IL-18 activity in breast cancer patients. Serum levels of VEGF, nitrate + nitrite and IL-18 were measured in 34 postmenopausal breast cancer patients before and 3 months after the tamoxifen therapy. Both serum VEGF and IL-18 levels decreased after tamoxifen therapy (P = 0.051, P < 0.05, respectively). Serum VEGF levels increased in patients with endometrial thickness, while patients without endometrial thickness had a significant reduction in serum VEGF levels after therapy (P < 0.05). Serum nitrate + nitrite levels increased after the therapy, but this was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). A decrease in serum VEGF levels with tamoxifen therapy may be a reflection of reduced angiogenic activity in patients without endometrial thickness. The negative effect of tamoxifen therapy on IL-18, which is known to have a potent antitumour activity, may be related to the decreased tumour growth by induction of NO and reduction of VEGF activity as a feedback mechanism."

CD011126,0,15645334,0,Automatic colon segmentation with dual scan CT colonography.,"We present a fully automated three-dimensional (3-D) segmentation algorithm to extract the colon lumen surface in CT colonography. Focusing on significant-size polyp detection, we target at an efficient algorithm that maximizes overall colon coverage, minimizes the extracolonic components, maintains local shape accuracy, and achieves high segmentation speed. Two-dimensional (2-D) image processing techniques are employed first, resulting in automatic seed placement and better colon coverage. This is followed by near-air threshold 3-D region-growing using an improved marching-cubes algorithm, which provides fast and accurate surface generation. The algorithm constructs a well-organized vertex-triangle structure that uniquely employs a hash table method, yielding an order of magnitude speed improvement. We segment two scans, prone and supine, independently and with the goal of improved colon coverage. Both segmentations would be available for subsequent polyp detection systems. Segmenting and analyzing both scans improves surface coverage by at least 6% over supine or prone alone. According to subjective evaluation, the average coverage is about 87.5% of the entire colon. Employing near-air threshold and elongation criteria, only 6% of the data sets include extracolonic components (EC) in the segmentation. The observed surface shape accuracy of the segmentation is adequate for significant-size (6 mm) polyp detection, which is also verified by the results of the prototype detection algorithm. The segmentation takes less than 5 minutes on an AMD 1-GHz single-processor PC, which includes reading the volume data and writing the surface results. The surface-based segmentation algorithm is practical for subsequent polyp detection algorithms in that it produces high coverage, has a low EC rate, maintains local shape accuracy, and has a computational efficiency that makes real-time polyp detection possible. A fully automatic or computer-aided polyp detection system using this technique is likely to benefit future colon cancer early screening."

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare a two-dimensional (2D) data interpretation technique with a three-dimensional (3D) colon dissection technique in terms of interpretation time and sensitivity for colonic polyp detection, with colonoscopy as the reference standard. Ninety-six patients (56 men, 40 women; mean age, 54.8 years) underwent colonoscopy and multidetector computed tomographic (CT) colonography on the same day. Two radiologists independently analyzed the data on a per-polyp and per-patient basis. The sensitivity of both approaches was compared by using the McNemar test. The time required to interpret CT colonographic data with each technique was also assessed. Compared with the conventional 2D colonic polyp detection method, primary 3D interpretation with use of virtual dissection software for CT colonography revealed comparable per-polyp (77% and 69% for two readers) and per-patient (77% and 73% for two readers) sensitivities and comparable per-patient specificity (99% and 89% for two readers) for the detection of polyps 6 mm in diameter or larger and involved a shorter interpretation time."

We report here the consequences of organized screening with usual tests. CA 125 sampling and a transvaginal pelvic ultrasound by a radiologist were systematically conducted every 6 months. Seventy-two patients were eventually evaluable. Two incident cases of peritoneal carcinomatosis (FIGO IIIB, malignant epithelial serous high-grade tumors) were discovered in two asymptomatic women with a deleterous BRCA1 mutation (2.7%). We did not observe any other primary cancer cases but an ovarian metastasis of a breast cancer. Forty women went off the study: 32 had a prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Consistent with the literature, biannual screening tests combining CA125 and pelvis ultrasound is ineffective for early detection of a pelvic tumor of tubal or ovarian origin. Testing for BRCA1 or BRCA2 deleterious mutations is then crucial for suspected family syndromes of breast and ovarian cancer. For women carrying a deleterous mutation on BRCA1/2 a salpingo-oophorectomy is the only way, only the time of this surgery is debatable."

This effect can be assessed: (1) sonographically by measuring endometrial thickness, and (2) by serum hormone levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether administering ethinyl estradiol (EE) during CC treatment has any effect on endometrial thickness and/or hormone levels. Seventeen patients were treated with CC for one cycle and with CC plus EE in an adjacent cycle either before or after. The patients were followed by daily assessment of endometrial thickness, follicular growth and serum estradiol levels as well as midluteal prolactin and progesterone levels. We did not find any significant difference in either endometrial thickness, estradiol level, midluteal prolactin or progesterone levels between the two treatment protocols. We conclude that exogenous EE, in the dosage used in this study, does not overcome CC-induced alterations in endometrial thickness."

CD011126,0,14670197,0,Assessment of abnormal bleeding in menopausal women: an update.,"Peri and postmenopausal bleeding, with or without the use of hormone replacement therapy, is a common clinical problem. The exclusion of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma is the key issue in the evaluation of patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness has become a routine procedure and an initial investigation in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. There is debate as to whether a cut-off of 5 or 4 mm endometrial thickness should be employed. If the endometrial thickness is above these values, polyps have been diagnosed or the patient is presenting with recurrent bleeding, endometrial disease has to be excluded by histological assessment. Outpatient aspiration curettage has superseded dilatation and curettage, which was previously considered to be the gold standard for obtaining endometrial tissue, and provides the same sensitivity in detecting endometrial disease.

CD011126,0,15230877,0,"Combining intensity, edge and shape information for 2D and 3D segmentation of cell nuclei in tissue sections.","We present a region-based segmentation method in which seeds representing both object and background pixels are created by combining morphological filtering of both the original image and the gradient magnitude of the image. The seeds are then used as starting points for watershed segmentation of the gradient magnitude image. The fully automatic seeding is done in a generous fashion, so that at least one seed will be set in each foreground object. If more than one seed is placed in a single object, the watershed segmentation will lead to an initial over-segmentation, i.e. a boundary is created where there is no strong edge. Thus, the result of the initial segmentation is further refined by merging based on the gradient magnitude along the boundary separating neighbouring objects. This step also makes it easy to remove objects with poor contrast. As a final step, clusters of nuclei are separated, based on the shape of the cluster. The number of input parameters to the full segmentation procedure is only five. These parameters can be set manually using a test image and thereafter be used on a large number of images created under similar imaging conditions. This automated system was verified by comparison with manual counts from the same image fields. About 90% correct segmentation was achieved for two- as well as three-dimensional images."

Methods This was an open study in which 64 moderately symptomatic, postmenopausal women were treated in the outpatient clinic of our University Hospital for different intervals up to 1 year. The treatment consisted of a combination of patches delivering 25 µg/day estradiol and intravaginal pills containing 100 mg of micronized progesterone. Patches and pills were administered concomitantly in a twice-a-week protocol. The endometrial response was assessed by endovaginal ultrasound completed with suction biopsy when required. Results Both cumulative amenorrhea and no-bleeding rates increased progressively and reached 88.9% and 100.0%, respectively, by the 12th month. Isolated or repetitive episodes of bleeding, bleeding and spotting, or only spotting were reported by three, four, and 12 women, respectively. Endometrial thickness remained unaltered. Endometrium was atrophic in the seven women in whom a biopsy was performed. Conclusion The substantially reduced progestogen load determined by this combination achieved an acceptable incidence of spotting or bleeding when associated with a low estrogenic dose. There was no apparent endometrial stimulation. Additional studies are required to confirm this observation."

CD011126,0,16454932,0,Unusual presentation of a woman with polycystic ovaries and complex endometrial pathology.,"A 28-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) had attempted four assisted conception treatments, all of which were complicated by lack of response of the endometrium to the hypo-oestrogenic state induced with gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa). Consequently, two treatment cycles were abandoned, one prior to the ovulation induction of a fresh IVF treatment and the other prior to oestrogen replacement for a frozen-thawed embryo transfer treatment cycle. Extended down-regulation eventually resulted in endometrial thinning and allowed completion of the other two treatments, but the outcome was negative. A targeted mid-cycle ultrasound scan in a natural cycle at follow-up showed thick, non-homogenous endometrium. A repeat hysteroscopy on this occasion showed abnormal endometrium with chalk-like deposits. Histological diagnosis was chronic endometritis and endometrial hyperplasia with focal atypia. Microbiological tests, including those for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were negative. Because of atypical endometrial hyperplasia, this patient is currently under close follow-up by the original referring team. This case highlights inherent endometrial pathology presenting as non-responding endometrium to hormonal down-regulation, the limitations of conventional ultrasound scans, and the complimentary role of concomitant hysteroscopy in the correct identification of endometrial lesions that may negatively affect the assisted conception treatments."

A total of 111 women in their first IVF cycle were analysed. They were aged <40 years with basal FSH concentration <10 IU/l on recruitment for IVF treatment. AFC, mean ovarian volume and mean ovarian 3D power Doppler flow indices were determined on day 2 of the treatment cycle prior to a standard regimen of ovarian stimulation. Ovarian response was represented by the number of oocytes, serum oestradiol, the duration and dosage of gonadotrophins. AFC achieved the best predictive value in relation to the number of oocytes obtained, followed by age of women and BMI. Basal FSH concentration was the only predictive factor for the duration and dosage of gonadotrophin used. Mean ovarian 3D power Doppler flow indices were not predictive of pregnancy in a multiple logistic regression analysis.

Congestive heart failure is the biggest complication affecting the prognosis. A 57-year-old male was admitted with edema and low grade fever. Globe and stocking type polyneuropathy, increased levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone, serum M-protein component of the immunoglobulin A-lambda type, skin polypoid lesion, and organomegaly including cardiomegaly were observed. The diagnosis was Crow-Fukase syndrome based on these clinical features. High output heart failure and pulmonary hypertension were determined with a cardiac catheter. Diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor were effective to control his overhydration. The level of serum vascular endothelial growth factor was markedly increased and might be responsible for the manifestation of this syndrome with cardiac involvement."

CD011126,0,22411939,0,MR imaging for preoperative evaluation of primary rectal cancer: practical considerations.,"High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a pivotal role in the pretreatment assessment of primary rectal cancer. The success of this technique depends on obtaining good-quality high-resolution T2-weighted images of the primary tumor; the mesorectal fascia, peritoneal reflection, and other pelvic viscera; and superior rectal and pelvic sidewall lymph nodes. Although orthogonal axial high-resolution T2-weighted MR images are the cornerstone for the staging of primary rectal cancer, high-resolution sagittal and coronal images provide additional value, particularly in tumors that arise in a redundant tortuous rectum. Coronal high-resolution T2-weighted MR images also improve the assessment of nodal morphology, particularly for superior rectal and pelvic sidewall nodes, and of the relationship between advanced-stage tumors and adjacent pelvic structures. Rectal gel should be used in MR imaging examinations conducted for the staging of polypoid tumors, previously treated lesions, and small rectal tumors. However, it should not be used in examinations performed to stage large or low rectal tumors. Diffusion-weighted imaging is useful for identifying nodes and, occasionally, the primary tumor when the tumor is difficult to visualize with other sequences. Three-dimensional T2-weighted imaging provides multiplanar capability with a superior signal-to-noise ratio compared with two-dimensional T2-weighted imaging."

Through the description of a case report we also propose an interdisciplinary diagnostic approach and a laparoscopic surgical staging, with a long-term follow-up. The analysis shows that pelvic ultrasound is primary diagnostic procedure, and only 36% of publications clearly describe to have performed more specific investigation. The hormone assessment is performed in the presence of specific endocrine symptoms. Laparoscopic approach is chosen by a few surgeon. Laparotomic surgery is preferred based in not recent recommendations for ovarian cancer treatment, although it is demonstrated the efficacy and safety of laparoscopy in the treatment of ovarian epithelial tumors. Different steps that are usually used for oncological ovarian cancer staging are not always performed. Conservative and fertility sparing surgery is commonly accepted, and even preferred due to the young age of patients. In the surgical treatment of SLCTs is necessary to adopt common guidelines, and evenly define the steps that the patient should be submitted. If are observed epithelial cancer oncological principles, laparoscopic surgery should be the approach of choice for these patients."

CD011126,0,19605658,0,Müllerian duct anomalies and mimics in children and adolescents: correlative intraoperative assessment with clinical imaging.,"Müllerian duct anomalies (MDAs) are congenital entities that result from nondevelopment, defective vertical or lateral fusion, or resorption failure of the müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts. MDAs are common, although the majority are asymptomatic, and have been classified by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine according to clinical manifestations, prognosis, and treatment. Accurate diagnosis of an MDA is essential, since the management approach varies depending on the type of malformation. In females, when a müllerian duct becomes obstructed, the patient may present with an abdominal mass and dysmenorrhea. If the patient is not treated in a timely fashion, the consequences can be severe, extending even to infertility. When an MDA is suspected, ultrasonography (US) should be performed initially to delineate any abnormalities in the genital tract. However, US cannot help identify the type of MDA. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable technique for noninvasive evaluation of the female pelvic anatomy and accurate MDA classification. If obstruction is present, surgical correction of the MDA may be required, and further counseling of the patient with regard to reproductive possibilities becomes important.

CD011126,0,18025520,0,From the RSNA refresher courses: Image-guided thermal therapy of uterine fibroids.,"One of the most recent additions to the methods for image-guided therapy is magnetic resonance (MR)-guided focused ultrasound. This method represents a unique closed-loop therapy, with planning, guidance, control, and direct feedback (called MR thermometry), which work together to ensure an effective therapy. The focused ultrasound induces focal tissue destruction by thermocoagulation in a noninvasive manner. MR also enables real-time thermometry to be performed during each and every sonication. These characteristics make MR-guided focused ultrasound an exciting new approach for treating fibroids. Fibroids are diagnosed based on findings from the patient's physical examination supplemented by imaging results. MR imaging is preferred to other imaging modalities because it enables the fibroids and the entire pelvis to be fully examined. After individual fibroids are identified and the target area is defined by the radiologist, the target volume is analyzed in a three-dimensional assessment to ensure the patient's safety. The procedure begins with the delivery of low-power sonication, and the power is gradually increased until the therapeutic dose is reached. After the procedure, postcontrast images are acquired; these should demonstrate tissue necrosis. The results of clinical trials have shown that the treatment is safe, effective, and highly acceptable to patients."

CD011126,0,20547383,0,Novel implant for transcervical sterilization.,"Compared to laparoscopic surgery for interval tubal sterilization, the transcervical approach is an effective method of female sterilization which obviates the requirement of general anesthesia and surgical incision. However, current methods of transcervical sterilization are unable to provide an instant occlusion. This paper focuses on the design, development and testing of a novel implant (James E., Coleman, Christy Cummins, 2009. Anastomosis Devices and Method. US Patent 20090105733A1) to achieve instant permanent female sterilization via the transcervical approach. The implant is designed to be deployed under hysteroscopic visualization into the ostium of the fallopian tube and relies on instant mechanical occlusion. The implant includes two sets of wings that penetrate into the ostium and uterine muscle tissue and trap the tissue in between thus plugging the entrance of the fallopian tube. In order to design the shape of implant wings and to investigate the mechanical behavior of the implant, a three-dimensional (3D) model was developed and Finite Element Method (FEM) was used for simulations. The implant was validated by a number of successful deployments in bench testing, animal tissue and explanted human uteri. During the deployments in animal tissue and explanted uteri, it was observed that the two sets of wings completely trapped the tissue in between and the hydraulic pressure testing of the explanted uteri using saline solution and methylene blue proved the instant occlusion of the fallopian tubes. Initial results suggest that this novel implant provides a safe and effective method of female sterilization. Further development work is ongoing in preparation for ""first-in-man"" clinical trials."
CD011126,0,20639950,0,In vivo 3D human vocal fold imaging with polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography and a MEMS scanning catheter.,"We present in-vivo 3D human vocal fold images with polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT). Characterizing the extent and location of vocal fold lesions provides useful information in guiding surgeons during phonomicrosurgery. Previous studies showed that PS-OCT imaging can distinguish vocal fold lesions from normal tissue, but these studies were limited to 2D cross-sectional imaging and were susceptible to sampling error. In-vivo 3D endoscopic imaging was performed by using a recently developed 2-axis MEMS scanning catheter and a spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT), running at 18.5 frames/s. Imaging was performed in the operating room with patients under general anesthesia and 3D images were acquired either by 2D scanning of the scanner on the sites of interest or by combining 1D scanning and manual sliding to capture whole length of the vocal fold. Vocal fold scar, polyps, nodules, papilloma and malignant lesions were imaged and characteristics of individual lesions were analyzed in terms of spatial distribution and variation of tissue structure and birefringence. The 3D large sectional PS-OCT imaging showed that the spatial extent of vocal fold lesions can be found non-invasively with good contrast from normal tissue."
CD011126,0,20198556,0,Leydig-cell-tumor of the ovary that responded to GnRH-analogue administration - case report and review of the literature.,"Progressive hirsutism can be a symptom of an androgen-producing tumor, especially in postmenopausal women. We report a case of a 58-year-old woman who complained of progressive hirsutism, nervousness, irritability, anxiousness and an increased libido. Examination showed an unusual redness of her head, décolleté, palms and soles of her feet. Basal laboratory tests revealed a profound elevation of testosterone levels (7.5 microg/l) and normal levels of androstendione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, 17alpha-hydroxy-progesterone and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Also remarkable was that her red blood count, hemoglobin and hematocrit values were elevated while erythropoietin was within normal limits. Functional laboratory tests ruled out heterozygous C21-hydroxylase deficiency and showed a moderate insulin resistance on the oral glucose tolerance test. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a slightly hyperdensic area of 6 mm in the left ovary. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a contrast medium-accumulating area of 2 cm in the left ovary. Since the patient was initially reluctant to undergo surgery, a GnRH-analogue (triptoreline) was administered VIA intramuscular injection once per month for two months and testosterone levels were lowered to less than one third of the initial level (2 microg/l). Surgery was eventually performed with laparoscopic bilateral salpingoophorectomy, hysteroscopy and uterine curettage. The histologic examination revealed a Leydig cell tumor in the hilus and stroma of the left ovary. Postoperatively testosterone levels dropped dramatically and instantly into the normal range. Within months, the red blood count and hematocrit levels were within normal limits. The patient's face became more feminine, the redness of her face and hirsutism regressed. Her anxiousness and nervosity resolved and the insulin sensitivity improved. In this paper, polyglobulia, the metabolic and psychological changes due to hyperandrogenism are discussed, as well as the phenomenon that the tumor responded to a GnRH-analogue. Such a response implies that the tumor is either under gonadotropin control or that GnRH analogues have direct effects via receptors on tumorous Leydig cells."

Antibiotics are administrated in all cases according to the protocol but some of them need operative treatment also. Inflammatory tumors can develop in endometriotic and even in cancer adnexal masses. CA 125 is elevated in great number of patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

CD011126,0,17090618,0,Association of physical activity with development of uterine leiomyoma.,"The relation between physical activity and uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) has received little study, but exercise is protective for breast cancer, another hormonally mediated tumor. Participants in this study were randomly selected members of a health plan based in Washington, DC, aged 35-49 years (734 African Americans, 455 Whites) enrolled between 1996 and 1999. Fibroid status was based on ultrasound screening. Physical activity was based on detailed interview questions. Logistic regression with adjustment for body mass index and other risk factors showed that women in the highest category of physical activity were significantly less likely to have fibroids (odds ratio = 0.6, 95% confidence interval = 0.4, 0.9 for the highest vs. the lowest category (equivalent to approximately > or =7 hours/week vs <2 hours/week)). There was a dose-response pattern; a significant trend was seen for both African-American and White women. A multistate Bayesian analysis indicated that exercise was associated with tumor onset more strongly than with tumor growth. When data for women who reported major fibroid-related symptoms were excluded, results remained essentially unchanged, suggesting that the observed association could not be attributed to reverse causation (fibroids preventing exercise). The authors concluded that regular exercise might help women prevent fibroids."

In addition, subject acceptance of each testing position was recorded. Subjects were 20 women's health physiotherapists. The testing protocol included the best of three maximum voluntary contractions tested in each of four positions (crook lying, supine, sitting and standing). Significant differences in muscle strength and subject acceptance between positions were found with each tool, most often between lying and upright positions.

We included, in a prospective cohort, 49 successive postmenopausal women: 34 with metrorrhagia (group I) and 15 with no symptoms (group II) and we compared the results obtained by ultrasound examination, Pap smear and endometrial biopsy. Patients in group I had a higher frequency of risk factors and thick and abnormal endometrium. Unlike Pap smear, ultrasound examination and biopsy had comparable values. We could conclude that transvaginal sonography is a reliable technique for the endometrium evaluation in the postmenopausal women.

CD011126,0,20679701,0,The impact of the waveguide aperture size of the 3D 70 MHz AMC-8 locoregional hyperthermia system on tumour coverage.,"The 70 MHz AMC-4 system, with one ring of four waveguides, provides 2D power steering. The newly developed AMC-8 system enables 3D steering, using two rings of four 70 MHz waveguides. The current waveguide aperture size is 20.2 x 34.3 cm(2). Waveguides and water boluses cover a large area of the body, which is not ideal for short patients. The aim of this study is investigating the impact of smaller waveguides on tumour coverage, using treatment planning. Finite-difference time-domain simulations were performed at 2.5 x 2.5 x 5 mm(3) resolution. Virtual AMC-8 systems with waveguide aperture sizes of 20.5 x 34.25, 17.5 x 34.25, 14.5 x 34.25, 11.5 x 34.25, 8.5 x 34.25 cm(2) and the AMC-4 system were modelled. Simulations were performed for elliptical (36 x 24 x 100 cm(3)) tissue-equivalent phantoms and for five cervical cancer patients. For the phantoms S(ratio) (SAR(max_border)/SAR(target)) was evaluated for standard and optimized settings. For the patients, temperature distributions were evaluated after optimization of tumour temperature, while limiting normal tissue temperatures to 45 degrees C. Phantom simulations showed a favourable S(ratio) for all two-ring systems, compared to the AMC-4 system, for optimized phase-amplitude settings. Patient simulations demonstrated that the improvement in T(90) for the operational AMC-8 system was approximately 0.5 degrees C. This improvement was independent of the aperture size. The average number of imminent hot spots and their total volume was almost comparable for 8.5 and 20.5 cm wide apertures, but the locations were different. Two-ring waveguide systems with eight antennas and aperture sizes in the range from 20.5 x 34.25 cm(2) to 8.5 x 34.25 cm(2) showed a stable gain in tumour temperature compared to a single-ring four-antenna system with 20.5 x 34.25 cm(2) wide apertures."

The complications of HM include excessive bleeding, uterine perforation, prolonged operative times, and excessive intravasation of distention media. The author describes his technique of sonographically guided hysteroscopic myomectomy (SGHM). SGHM allows one to continuously monitor the progress of resectoscopic surgery while minimizing the risk of uterine perforation and permitting one to incorporate non-resectoscopic morcellation.

A 24 years old female presented with abdominal discomfort and menorrhagia. Clinical and ultrasonographic examination revealed an enlarged uterus. The hysterectomy specimen showed a symmetrically enlarged uterus with a bosselated external surface. The cut surface showed multiple nodules of varying sizes diffusely involving the myometrium. Microscopically, the nodules were leiomyomas of varying degrees of cellularity. Some of the leiomyomas showed an increased vascularity either in the form of congeries of blood vessels with a lobular arrangement or occasionally as foci of 2-3 vessels. The vessels were surrounded by whorls of spindle cells. On immunohistochemistry the leiomyomas expressed vimentin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin and CD10: the cells whorling around the blood vessels expressed vimentin, SMA and focally desmin and were negative for CD10 and HMB-45. The aim of this paper is to document that CD10 is expressed in diffuse uterine leiomyomatosis and discuss the histogenesis of DUL."

A total of 118 women with postmenopausal uterine bleeding were studied prospectively. Thirty postmenopausal women without vaginal bleeding and without gynaecological complaints served as a control group. In women with histopathological diagnosis of atrophic endometrium the mean endometrial thickness was 3.1 +/- 1.7 mm whereas the corresponding value for patients with endometrial carcinoma was 18.4 +/- 8.2 mm (P < 0.001). No endometrial carcinoma was diagnosed in endometrial thickness < or = 6 mm. The sensitivity was 100% and specificity 64% if a 6-mm cutoff limit was used. We consider that transvaginal ultrasonographic investigation for post-menopausal bleeding may provide useful information for selection of those patients who are under higher risk of endometrial abnormalities. When using vaginal sonography for measuring the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding, it is reasonable not to perform a dilatation and curettage if the endometrial thickness is < or = 6 mm."

CD011126,0,24325128,0,GyneScan: an improved online paradigm for screening of ovarian cancer via tissue characterization.,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth highest cause of cancer in women and the leading cause of death from gynecological cancers. Accurate diagnosis of ovarian cancer from acquired images is dependent on the expertise and experience of ultrasonographers or physicians, and is therefore, associated with inter observer variabilities. Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) techniques use a number of different data mining techniques to automatically predict the presence or absence of cancer, and therefore, are more reliable and accurate. A review of published literature in the field of CAD based ovarian cancer detection indicates that many studies use ultrasound images as the base for analysis. The key objective of this work is to propose an effective adjunct CAD technique called GyneScan for ovarian tumor detection in ultrasound images. In our proposed data mining framework, we extract several texture features based on first order statistics, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and run length matrix. The significant features selected using t-test are then used to train and test several supervised learning based classifiers such as Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB). We evaluated the developed framework using 1300 benign and 1300 malignant images. Using 11 significant features in KNN/PNN classifiers, we were able to achieve 100% classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value in detecting ovarian tumor. Even though more validation using larger databases would better establish the robustness of our technique, the preliminary results are promising. This technique could be used as a reliable adjunct method to existing imaging modalities to provide a more confident second opinion on the presence/absence of ovarian tumor."

Normal endometrium was the source of bleeding in 24 cases (48.9%) while 11 cases (22.4%) had evidence of endometritis. Endometrial hyperplasia and polyps were present in 12 cases (24.4%). Two cases were found to have malignancy in the surgical specimen, which were not evident on pre-operative endometrial biopsy. However, there was high degree of suspicion of malignancy in these 2 cases based on the endometrial histopathology and ultrasonographic endometrial thickness. By careful correlation of clinical findings, endometrial histopathology and ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness, most cases with postmenopausal bleeding can be managed conservatively."

A total of 103 boys were tested for urinary schistosomiasis using the urine filtration method. Schistosoma haematobium (S. haematobium) eggs were counted. Ultrasound was performed for all the positive subjects. Seventy-three (71%) subjects were positive for S. haematobium. The mean age was 11.3 ± 2.9 years. Sixty-six (90.4%) subjects showed urinary tract abnormalities. The findings revealed the following degrees of wall thickening: 53.0% mild, 18.2% moderate and 21.2% severe. Urinary bladder polyp(s) were noted in 43.3% (single) and 40.9% (multiple) of the subjects, and calcification of the bladder wall was observed in 7.6% subjects.

In many cases, however, there may be little residual tissue within the uterus, and the patient may be exposed to an unnecessary operative procedure. The purpose of this study was to use sonographically derived measurements of the uterine cavity to select cases suitable for conservative management. Of 50 women presenting with a diagnosis of spontaneous abortion, 32 were chosen for non-operative treatment based upon their uterine cavity measurements. In all of these cases, bleeding had ceased within 2 weeks of selection and the pregnancy test had become negative. There were no subsequent complications. In our opinion, sonographic examination of the uterus allows the selection of those cases which can safely be managed conservatively."

CD011126,0,19926760,0,US of the tunica vaginalis testis: anatomic relationships and pathologic conditions.,"Extratesticular lesions are common incidental findings at ultrasonography (US) among men and boys. Most lesions originate from or depend on the tunica vaginalis, a mesothelium-lined sac with a visceral layer and a parietal layer. The tunica vaginalis is formed when the superior portion of the processus vaginalis closes during embryologic development. Abnormal closure of the processus vaginalis leads to congenital anomalies of the tunica vaginalis, such as complete or partial patency of the processus vaginalis, spermatic cord hydrocele, and inguinoscrotal hernia. The proximity of the visceral layer to the testis explains the reactive involvement seen in epididymo-orchitis, with resultant pyocele or abscess formation. The tunica vaginalis also may be affected by inflammatory and traumatic disorders such as scrotal calculi, fibrous pseudotumor, or hematocele. These lesions manifest as solid or heterogeneous tumorlike masses. Lesions of mesothelial origin, such as adenomatoid tumor, tunica cyst, and mesothelioma, may involve the tunica vaginalis. Entrapped mesenchymal cells can lead to lipoma, leiomyoma, or sarcoma, although these tumors are uncommon in the tunica vaginalis. US is not useful for differentiating between benign and malignant tumors; however, some characteristic findings may help in planning the best surgical approach. Knowledge of the embryologic development, anatomic relationships, and pathologic disorders of the tunica vaginalis is essential to narrow the differential diagnosis of an extratesticular lesion. In most cases, US findings in combination with clinical assessment can indicate whether nonsurgical management or testis-sparing surgery is warranted."

CD011126,0,16581810,0,Protamines and male infertility.,"Protamines are the major nuclear sperm proteins. The human sperm nucleus contains two types of protamine: protamine 1 (P1) encoded by a single-copy gene and the family of protamine 2 (P2) proteins (P2, P3 and P4), all also encoded by a single gene that is transcribed and translated into a precursor protein. The protamines were discovered more than a century ago, but their function is not yet fully understood. In fact, different hypotheses have been proposed: condensation of the sperm nucleus into a compact hydrodynamic shape, protection of the genetic message delivered by the spermatozoa, involvement in the processes maintaining the integrity and repair of DNA during or after the nucleohistone-nucleoprotamine transition and involvement in the epigenetic imprinting of the spermatozoa. Protamines are also one of the most variable proteins found in nature, with data supporting a positive Darwinian selection. Changes in the expression of P1 and P2 protamines have been found to be associated with infertility in man. Mutations in the protamine genes have also been found in some infertile patients. Transgenic mice defective in the expression of protamines also present several structural defects in the sperm nucleus and have variable degrees of infertility. There is also evidence that altered levels of protamines may result in an increased susceptibility to injury in the spermatozoan DNA causing infertility or poor outcomes in assisted reproduction. The present work reviews the articles published to date on the relationship between protamines and infertility."

Endometrial and subendometrial blood flow was evaluated on the days of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration and embryo transfer and the percentage change in endometrial and subendometrial blood flow between these 2 days was assessed as a predictor of pregnancy during IVF treatment. A three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound examination with power Doppler was performed in 293 patients undergoing the first IVF cycle to determine endometrial thickness, endometrial volume, vascularization index, flow index and vascularization flow index of endometrial and subendometrial regions on the days of HCG and embryo transfer. Patients in non-pregnant and pregnant groups had comparable endometrial thickness, endometrial volume and 3D power Doppler flow indices of endometrial and subendometrial regions measured on either day. Percentage changes in endometrial and subendometrial 3D power Doppler flow indices were also similar.

There are different studies that point to ovarian reserve damage due to laparoscopic cystectomy. In this study, we evaluate the ovarian damage following laparoscopic cystectomy for non-endometriosis cysts using ultrasound and pathology findings. This is a prospective cohort study conducted between 7 rd month of 2011 and 10th month of 2012 in Women hospital affiliated to Tehran university of medical sciences.45 non-endometriosis cysts (17 teratoma,7 mucinous, 10 simple serous and 11 simple cysts) underwent laparoscopic cystectomy with stripping technique. Amount of excised parenchyma, number of lost oocytes and cyst wall fibrosis thickness were histopathologically studied. Before and 3 months after surgery antral follicle count was evaluated by ultrasound. AFC after cystectomy for teratoma and simple serous was significantly reduced P<0.05. By larger teratomas and more parenchyma inadvertently removed during their excision (1.64, 0.255) reduced AFC was seen and in simple serous cysts with more removed parenchyma amount (1.5) reduced AFC occurred. In our study simple cysts excision led to a loss in AFC that was not associated with any other cyst parameters. Mucinous cysts resection led to no specific ovarian reserve damage. Laparoscopic cystectomy for non-endometriosis leads to reduced ovarian reserve."

CD011126,0,15151730,0,Prediction of pituitary down-regulation by evaluation of endometrial thickness in an IVF programme.,"The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether pituitary down-regulation after gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) administration can be accurately predicted by transvaginal ultrasonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in the presence of menstruation. All cycles of an IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection programme in which a long protocol of GnRHa was used for ovarian stimulation were analysed. Overall, 209 patients underwent 223 treatment cycles. Using a serum oestradiol concentration of 50 pg/ml as a cut-off point, the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and false positive and false negative values were calculated for prediction of pituitary down-regulation from endometrial thickness measurements. Pituitary down-regulation was achieved in 223 treatment cycles in 180 patients (80%). The best combination of the highest specificity (71.7%) and sensitivity (62.5%) is achieved with a linear appearance of the endometrium. Therefore, ultrasonographic measurement of endometrial thickness should be used in combination with serum oestradiol concentration in estimating pituitary down-regulation after GnRHa. In conclusion, the linear appearance of endometrium can be as reliable as serum oestradiol concentration in prediction of pituitary down-regulation after GnRHa."

CD011126,0,15123059,0,Use of morphology to characterize and manage common adnexal masses.,"The use of grey-scale ultrasound morphology to characterize a pelvic mass may also be called 'pattern recognition'. The grey-scale ultrasound image provides us with the same information as that obtained by the surgeon or pathologist when he or she cuts a surgical specimen to see what it looks like inside. Many pelvic masses have such a typical macroscopic appearance that a fairly confident diagnosis can be made on the basis of their macroscopic appearance alone, i.e. on the basis of their grey-scale ultrasound image. This is true of most dermoid cysts, endometriomas, corpus luteum cysts, hydrosalpinges and peritoneal pseudocysts, and of many paraovarian cysts and benign solid ovarian tumours, for example, fibromas, fibrothecomas, thecofibromas, thecomas and Brenner tumours. A mass with irregularities should always evoke suspicion of malignancy. A mass that is completely smooth is almost certainly benign. Papillary projections--considered a strong sign of malignancy--are more common in borderline tumours than in invasive cancers but may also be seen in benign tumours, for example, in adenofibromas. They explain many false-positive ultrasound diagnoses of malignancy. Pattern recognition is superior to all other ultrasound methods (e.g. simple classification systems, scoring systems, mathematical models for calculating the risk of malignancy) for discrimination between benign and malignant extrauterine pelvic masses. Today's often too liberal use of transvaginal ultrasound gives clinicians problems. Many adnexal masses that probably would have remained undetected before the ultrasound era are now found incidentally at transvaginal ultrasound examination in women without symptoms of an adnexal tumour. The natural history of incidentally detected pelvic masses with benign ultrasound morphology is not known. Therefore, the optimal management of such tumours is also unknown."
CD011126,0,15123058,0,Menorrhagia and abnormal bleeding before the menopause.,"Abnormal uterine bleeding before the menopause accounts for 20% of visits to the gynaecology clinic and almost 25% of gynaecological operations. The patient who presents with such bleeding presents two distinct but important challenges for the clinician. The first is the exclusion of cancer or hyperplasia; the second is dealing with the annoyance as well as the fear that the bleeding engenders in the patient. Any attempt at appropriate therapy--whether surgical, hormonal or expectant--begins with an accurate diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound with saline infusion sonohysterography for selective patients has emerged as a safe, non-invasive and, inexpensive method of triaging patients with abnormal uterine bleeding in order to determine which patients require no further evaluation, blind endometrial sampling for a global endometrial process or visually directed endometrial sampling when pathology is thought to be focal."

In addition, the investigation should provide the clinician with useful prognostic information regarding possible future treatment. At present, extensive use of invasive procedures such as diagnostic hysteroscopy and laparoscopy is the standard at many fertility centres. Recent advances in gynaecological ultrasonography have shown that ultrasound can replace routine invasive investigative procedures. An ultrasound-based approach would make the basic infertility investigation less time-consuming and less expensive, but at the same time more acceptable to the majority of patients. This chapter describes an ultrasound-based approach to the assessment of infertility. In addition, the role of ultrasonography for assessment of the pelvic organs as a basic part of the initial investigation of an infertile couple is discussed and compared to more traditional invasive methods."
CD011126,0,15123054,0,Irregular or absent periods--what can an ultrasound scan tell you?,"Transvaginal ultrasonography has increased our appreciation of the physiological changes in the ovary and endometrium that occur during the normal menstrual cycle. It has become a primary investigative tool in women with irregular or absent periods. Its usefulness in cases of primary amenorrhoea to assess anatomy is also undisputed although it may have limitations in terms of its specificity. However, the interpretation of ultrasound images in women with irregular menses or secondary amenorrhoea is not entirely straightforward. This is particularly true in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition of uncertain aetiology, which may present with oligoamenorrhoea. This chapter aims to discuss the benefits and limitations of ultrasound while taking into account the broad overlap between normal and abnormal physiology, some of which has still to be elucidated."
CD011126,0,15123057,0,The management of early pregnancy complications.,"Early pregnancy complications include miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, pregnancies of unknown location, adnexal masses and hydatidiform mole. The management of women with these complications has changed with the introduction of dedicated Early Pregnancy Units, with a shift away from a surgical approach to one based on an expectant or 'watch and wait' policy. This chapter describes the role of transvaginal sonography (TVS) in the management of these women and critically evaluates the different treatment modalities available for the management of these complications. The management of miscarriage has largely changed from a surgical to an expectant or medical approach. The treatment of ectopic pregnancy (EP) is also being managed in a similar way as the condition is increasingly detected earlier. We will argue that EP should not be diagnosed on the basis of the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy but rather by the positive visualization of an adnexal mass using TVS. If a pregnancy cannot be seen either inside or outside the uterus this should be described as a pregnancy of unknown location and managed expectantly until the outcome is confirmed."

CD011126,0,19338610,0,Clinical use and research applications of Heidelberg retinal angiography and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography - a review.,"Fluorescein angiography (FA) was discovered by Nowotny and Alvis in the 1960s of the 20th century and has evolved to become the 'Gold standard' for macular diagnostics. Scanning laser imaging technology achieved enhancement of contrast and resolution. The combined Heidelberg retina angiograph (HRA2) adds novel innovative features to established fundus cameras. The principle of confocal scanning laser imaging provides a high resolution of retinal and choroidal vasculature with low light exposure providing comfort and safety for the patient. Enhanced contrast, details and image sharpness image are generated using confocality. For the visualization of the choroid an indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is the most suitable application. The main indications for ICGA are age-related macular degeneration, choroidal polypoidal vasculopathy and choroidal haemangiomas. Simultaneous digital FA and ICGA images with three-dimensional resolution offer improved diagnosis of retinal and choroidal pathologies. High-speed ICGA dynamic imaging can identify feeder vessels and retinal choroidal anastomoses, ensuring safer treatment of choroidal neovascularization. Autofluorescence imaging and fundus reflectance imaging with blue and infrared light offer new follow-up parameters for retinal diseases. Finally, the real-time optical coherence tomography provides a new level of accuracy for assessment of the angiographic and morphological correlation. The combination of various macular diagnostic tools, such as infrared, blue reflectance, fundus autofluorescence, FA, ICGA and also spectral domain optical coherence tomography, lead to a better understanding and improved knowledge of macular diseases."

CD011126,0,22171355,0,Tracking iron in multiple sclerosis: a combined imaging and histopathological study at 7 Tesla.,"Previous authors have shown that the transverse relaxivity R(2)* and frequency shifts that characterize gradient echo signal decay in magnetic resonance imaging are closely associated with the distribution of iron and myelin in the brain's white matter. In multiple sclerosis, iron accumulation in brain tissue may reflect a multiplicity of pathological processes. Hence, iron may have the unique potential to serve as an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging tracer of disease pathology. To investigate the ability of iron in tracking multiple sclerosis-induced pathology by magnetic resonance imaging, we performed qualitative histopathological analysis of white matter lesions and normal-appearing white matter regions with variable appearance on gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla. The samples used for this study derive from two patients with multiple sclerosis and one non-multiple sclerosis donor. Magnetic resonance images were acquired using a whole body 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner equipped with a 24-channel receive-only array designed for tissue imaging. A 3D multi-gradient echo sequence was obtained and quantitative R(2)* and phase maps were reconstructed. Immunohistochemical stainings for myelin and oligodendrocytes, microglia and macrophages, ferritin and ferritin light polypeptide were performed on 3- to 5-µm thick paraffin sections. Iron was detected with Perl's staining and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride enhanced Turnbull blue staining. In multiple sclerosis tissue, iron presence invariably matched with an increase in R(2)*. Conversely, R(2)* increase was not always associated with the presence of iron on histochemical staining. We interpret this finding as the effect of embedding, sectioning and staining procedures. These processes likely affected the histopathological analysis results but not the magnetic resonance imaging that was obtained before tissue manipulations. Several cellular sources of iron were identified. These sources included oligodendrocytes in normal-appearing white matter and activated macrophages/microglia at the edges of white matter lesions. Additionally, in white matter lesions, iron precipitation in aggregates typical of microbleeds was shown by the Perl's staining. Our combined imaging and pathological study shows that multi-gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging is a sensitive technique for the identification of iron in the brain tissue of patients with multiple sclerosis. However, magnetic resonance imaging-identified iron does not necessarily reflect pathology and may also be seen in apparently normal tissue. Iron identification by multi-gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging in diseased tissues can shed light on the pathological processes when coupled with topographical information and patient disease history."

We aimed to assess the clinical outcome of these repairs when done by the overlapping sphincteroplasty technique with reconstruction of the internal anal sphincter and perineum. Between August 2005 and December 2006, all grades 3 and 4 obstetric anal sphincter tears in our department were repaired by a reconstructive pelvic surgeon, primarily using the overlapping sphincteroplasty technique with reconstruction of the internal anal sphincter and perineum. All women were followed every 6 months using the Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory and Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire, a physical examination of the anal sphincter, anal manometry, and transperineal anal sonography. There were 3,478 deliveries of which 22 (0.63%) anal sphincter tears were repaired in women aged 22-41 years. Two women were diagnosed with Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists grade 3a, eight with grade 3b, nine with grade 3c, and three with grade 4 anal sphincter tears. Postoperatively, 21 patients attended the outpatient clinic, with an average follow-up time of 9.2+/-1.4 months. Only two women (9.5%) complained of flatus incontinence and fecal urgency and had mildly decreased anal sphincter squeeze pressure and a small sonographic anal sphincter defect. None of the women complained of fecal incontinence. Two women (9.5%) reported on transient perineal pain and one (4.8%) on transient dyspareunia. All other women were asymptomatic and had normal anal manometry and sonographic evaluation. Repair of obstetric anal sphincter tears using the overlapping sphincteroplasty technique with reconstruction of the internal anal sphincter and perineum seems to carry favorable clinical outcome and reduced risk for anal incontinence, perineal pain, and sexual dysfunction."

He started bleeding from the age of 10. The bleeding lasted for 2-3 days. He also had cyclical lower abdominal pain, which remained unexplained. Menstruation occurred every 3-4 months. Left testis was normal but there was a separate soft palpable mass from its lower pole. Chromosomal analysis showed translocation of X and Y chromosome 45(t X/Y). Ultrasonography revealed normal kidneys with well-filled urinary bladder that appeared regular in outline. Left testis was normal in size, measuring about 2.73 × 1.72 cm. Its echotexture was finely homogenous with no evidence of collection or mass. There was a multiloculated cystic mass in the right half of scrotum. Right testis was not visualised along the line of descent. Surprisingly, uterus was found to be present and normal in size and anteverted in position. Fluid collection was noted in the uterine cavity. No ovarian outline was noted. FSH level was almost four times the normal level for males (31.74 IU). The LH level was slightly raised (16.17 IU). The testosterone, Estradiol and Prolactin level were within normal male range, being 3.5 microgram/L, 24 pg/L, and 13.54 microgram/L respectively. Semen analysis revealed azoospermia but the amount of semen was normal. After discussion with the patient, a total abdominal hysterectomy with right-sided salpingo-oophorectomy and left salpingectomy was performed under general anaesthesia. True hermaphrodites must be distinguished from a false one, they have both male and female gonadal tissue, false hermaphrodites are unisexual, but their sex organs resemble those of the opposite sex. This particular patient raised great interest because true hermaphrodites are rare. Attempts were made to make his life normal as a male. If he had the opportunity to have easy access to medical treatment, would he be raised as a female? Controversies are paramount. In this patient, subsequent surgery was done by urologists to correct the chordee and the hypospadias. The overall life of this patient is still a dilemma to us. It was a rare case of hysterectomy done, from the gynaecologist's point of view."

CD011126,0,20093084,0,The pattern of pregnancy loss in women with congenital uterine anomalies and recurrent miscarriage.,"Congenital uterine anomalies (CUA) are a known cause of recurrent miscarriage (RM), but the pattern of pregnancy loss that different CUA produce remains unknown. This study included 665 women with RM who were screened for CUA using a combined two-dimensional ultrasound (2D-US) and hysterosalpingography (HSG) approach. All suspected CUA were definitively diagnosed and classified via a combined hysteroscopy/laparoscopy procedure. Pregnancy outcomes were evaluated and compared for each type of CUA versus a control group of women with no identifiable cause of RM (unexplained RM). Fifty-six women with CUA and 107 women with unexplained RM were identified. In total, 881 pregnancies were analysed. Analysis showed that women with a septate or bicornuate uterus suffered from significantly increased second-trimester miscarriages compared with controls (13.2% and 13.8% versus 1.0%; P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). Women with an arcuate, septate or bicornuate uterus showed significantly reduced rates of biochemical pregnancy losses compared with controls (9.5%, 11.1% and 11.1% versus 30.4%; P<0.01, P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively).

CD011126,0,19492276,0,[Therapy for urinary incontinence in general practice].,"In national and international guidelines the general practitioner plays an important role in the diagnosis and first-line therapy for urinary incontinence. Nevertheless, there is a lack of data concerning details of the management of incontinence in primary care in Germany. Therefore a series of nationwide educational events for general practitioners and gynaecologists was used to perform a survey dealing with the situation of urinary incontinence in general practice. With 2530 questionnaires filled out and returned, this is the largest European survey on this subject. General practitioners declare in 57.3 % to be often involved with urinary incontinence. They usually question elderly patients about urinary incontinence (73.7 %) or those patients with diseases carrying the risk of developing urinary incontinence (64.9 %). Based on the diagnostic options in primary care, an incontinence anamnesis and urine evaluation are performed. A sonography or micturition diary was more infrequent in primary care in this survey. General practitioners most frequent refer the patient to a specialist (76.6 %) or prescribe the incontinence-type anticholinergic drugs (59.4 %) or absorbent products (45.4 %); duloxetine (27.3 %) is less frequently prescribed. The knowledge about urinary incontinence is gained in educational events (72.2 %); the course of studies was the source of incontinence skills for general practitioners only in 35 %. In conclusion, this survey gives a realistic view on the incontinence management in primary care in Germany. The majority of general practitioners are engaged in incontinence, perform basic diagnostic features and prescribe drugs or absorbent products. The course of (university medical school) studies as a source of skills to diagnose or to treat incontinence should be improved."

CD011126,0,22190408,0,Obstetric levator ani muscle injuries: current status.,"Levator ani muscle (LAM) injuries occur in 13-36% of women who have a vaginal delivery. Although these injuries were first described using magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional transperineal and endovaginal ultrasound has emerged as a more readily available and economic alternative to identify LAM morphology. Injury to the LAM is attributed to vaginal delivery resulting in reduced pelvic floor muscle strength, enlargement of the vaginal hiatus and pelvic organ prolapse. There is inconclusive evidence to support an association between LAM injuries and stress urinary incontinence and there seems to be a trend towards the development of fecal incontinence. Longitudinal studies with long-term follow-up assessing the LAM before and after childbirth are lacking. Furthermore, the consequence of LAM injuries on quality of life due to prolapse and/or urinary and fecal incontinence have not been evaluated using validated questionnaires. Direct comparative studies using the above-mentioned imaging modalities are needed to determine the true gold standard for the diagnosis of LAM injuries. This would enable consistency in definition and classification of LAM injuries. Only then could high-risk groups be identified and preventive strategies implemented in obstetric practice."

CD011126,0,22717411,0,Endoscopic image analysis in semantic space.,"A novel approach to the design of a semantic, low-dimensional, encoding for endoscopic imagery is proposed. This encoding is based on recent advances in scene recognition, where semantic modeling of image content has gained considerable attention over the last decade. While the semantics of scenes are mainly comprised of environmental concepts such as vegetation, mountains or sky, the semantics of endoscopic imagery are medically relevant visual elements, such as polyps, special surface patterns, or vascular structures. The proposed semantic encoding differs from the representations commonly used in endoscopic image analysis (for medical decision support) in that it establishes a semantic space, where each coordinate axis has a clear human interpretation. It is also shown to establish a connection to Riemannian geometry, which enables principled solutions to a number of problems that arise in both physician training and clinical practice. This connection is exploited by leveraging results from information geometry to solve problems such as (1) recognition of important semantic concepts, (2) semantically-focused image browsing, and (3) estimation of the average-case semantic encoding for a collection of images that share a medically relevant visual detail. The approach can provide physicians with an easily interpretable, semantic encoding of visual content, upon which further decisions, or operations, can be naturally carried out. This is contrary to the prevalent practice in endoscopic image analysis for medical decision support, where image content is primarily captured by discriminative, high-dimensional, appearance features, which possess discriminative power but lack human interpretability."

CD011126,0,12944170,0,Design and characterization of an intracavitary ultrasound hyperthermia applicator for recurrent or residual lesions in the vaginal cuff.,"For evaluating the feasibility of treating recurrent lesions in the vaginal cuff by hyperthermia, a 2-element ultrasound applicator was designed, constructed and characterized. A half-cylindrical transducer (d=1 cm, length=1 cm) was used to construct the 2-element ultrasound applicator. Each element of this applicator was operated at 1.5 MHz and characterized by measuring transducer efficiency and acoustic power distribution. Thermocouple probes were used to measure the temperature rise in the phantom. The element sizes used in this study were selected to be comparable to a high dose rate brachytherapy colpostat applicator. Each element was powered separately to achieve a desired temperature pattern in a target. The acoustic output power as a function of applied electric power of elements 1 and 2 were linear over this 1-40 W range and efficiencies were 32.2 +/- 3.4% and 46.2 +/- 0.8%, respectively. The temperature measurements in the phantom showed that a 6 degrees C temperature rise was achieved 2 cm from the applicator surface. As a conclusion, the ability of the ultrasound colpostat applicator to be used for hyperthermia was demonstrated by measuring acoustic output power, ultrasound field distribution and temperature rise in the phantom. Based on the characteristics of this applicator, it has the potential to be useful for inducing hyperthermia to the vaginal cuff in the clinic."

Only a few reported cases have been treated using laparoscopy. Hemostasis after trophoblast removal can be challenging. A 25-year-old primigravida in week 8 of pregnancy was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of missed abortion. An ultrasound scan showed an empty uterine cavity and a gestational sac with a 15-mm embryo dorsal to the uterus, indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. The preoperative serum concentration of human chorionic gonadotropin was 33 600 U/mL. Laparoscopy was performed, which revealed an omental pregnancy invading the peritoneum of the Douglas pouch. After laparoscopic removal of the ectopic pregnancy with partial omentectomy, diffuse bleeding from the crater between both sacrouterine ligaments was treated using the gelatin-thrombin matrix (FloSeal). The final histologic analysis confirmed the omentum as the primary site of the ectopic pregnancy (multiple chorionic villi and decidua within the omental fat). The postoperative period was uneventful. This case expands the classic Studdiford criteria. Secondary peritoneal ectopic pregnancy implantation can occur not only after tubal rupture or expulsion of tubal ectopic pregnancy but also after primary implantation at any other ectopic site. The laparoscopic approach to abdominal pregnancy is safe and feasible if there is sufficient intraoperative hemostasis. The hemostatic matrix facilitates quick and effective control of bleeding."

Half of these women manifest no clinical symptoms and discovering the malformation is incidental. The other half having congenital or acquired uterine malformation suffers from fertility problems or obstetric complications such as preterm labor, intrauterine growth restriction and pathological lie or presentation. Since some of this malformation can be surgically corrected, pre-surgical pelvic imaging has a diagnostic and therapeutic value. One of the common imaging methods is the pelvic ultrasonography. A major disadvantage of two-dimensional pelvic ultrasonography is its inability to reconstruct the uterine coronal axis. Imaging of this axis has major significance in the diagnosis of uterine fundus malformation. In recent years further advances in ultrasonography have led to three-dimensional ultrasonography (3DUS). This method enables multiplanner three-dimensional reconstruction of the uterus. This review shows the advantages of the three-dimensional ultrasound as a diagnostic tool. Several works are reviewed comparing this imaging method to others. The authors also present several examples of uterine malformations from their own experience."
CD011126,0,17476934,0,[Three dimensional (3D) ultrasound in gynecology: a breakthrough?].,"A variety of techniques can be used to assess the pelvic organs, mainly the uterus and ovaries and tubes. Traditionally, X-ray hysterosalpingography has also been used to observe pathology in the uterine cavity, and thereby to indirectly evaluate the adjacent endometrium and myometrium. With the advent of high-resolution vaginal probes transvaginal sonography (TVS) has assumed an important role in assessing the myometrium and the endometrial echo complex. The 3D ultrasound can depict lesions not easily diagnosed by conventional 2D ultrasound due to the fact that the coronal plain is easily accessible. The coronal views manifest the relationship between the endometrium and the myometrium at the uterine fundus, delineate the entire cervical canal and visualize the corneal angles. A major advantage of the 3D ultrasound is the ability to rapidly acquire and store ultrasonographic data. This volume data can then be retrospectively analyzed with no loss of information. One can also ""scroll"" in real-time through the acquired volume that can be rotated and magnified. In conclusion, 3D ultrasound may provide additional information compared with standard accepted techniques in the vast majority of women."

CD011126,0,26506672,0,Non-invasive ventilation for the treatment of acute respiratory failure following ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: report of two cases and a brief review of the literature.,"The ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a serious but rarely fatal complication of medical interventions that seek to induce fertility; it is typically encountered in women who undergo controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, but there are very rare patients who have genetic defects who present with OHSS. In recent years, its pathogenesis has been elucidated; this knowledge will decrease the frequency of this syndrome. Clinical signs may include any or all of the following: rapid weight gain, ascites, oliguria, hemoconcentration, leukocytosis, along with intravascular hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. If the patient is not diagnosed early, ascites, pleural and more rarely pericardial effusions, severe respiratory failure and ARDS, hypercoagulability with tromboembolism and multiple organ system failure can occur. Due to the increased use of therapeutic strategies for infertility (particularly those using human chorionic gonadotropin), the systemic, particularly the pulmonary, complications of this syndrome must be identified early to allow appropriate diagnosis and management. We describe two cases of women with extremely severe OHSS presenting bilateral pleural effusions, and severe respiratory failure (paO2/FiO2 < 200) treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The severe form of OHSS varies between 0.5% and 5%, depending on the population studied: intensive care may be required for management of tromboembolic complications, renal failure and severe respiratory failure. The diagnosis of severe OHSS was made, largely based on bedside ultrasonography showing increased ovarian size, mild ascites and bilateral pleural effusions. Owing to severe respiratory failure the patients were admitted to Respiratory Intermediate Care. Pulmonary intensive care may involve thoracentesis, oxygen supplementation and in more severe cases assisted ventilation. There are only a few studies in English that describe severe respiratory failure treated with non-invasive ventilation, but all of them have had good outcomes."

We sonographically evaluated and biochemically diagnosed 35 patients with PCO, 31 women with PCOS and 23 healthy controls. We performed oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and calculated the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and the homeostatic model assessment (HOMAIR) scores. Serum fasting insulin levels, 1-h insulin response, HOMAIR and QUICKI scores were significantly higher in the PCO and PCOS groups than in the controls. However, serum fasting glucose levels, fasting insulin levels, HOMAIR and QUICKI scores were similar in women with PCO and PCOS. In women with PCO, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were higher, and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglyceride levels were lower compared with women with PCOS. Furthermore, insulin responses to OGTT, HOMAIR and QUICKI scores and lipid values correlated with serum androgen levels and body mass index (BMI) in PCO patients. In conclusion, women with PCO who do not fulfill the criteria for PCOS have abnormal insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance. The finding of similar insulin abnormalities in women with PCO to those in women with PCOS confirms that women with PCO have similar metabolic characteristics to those with PCOS."

Forty-seven patients with 51 adnexal masses were examined with 3D-CEUS. The sonographic features of masses were analyzed. All diagnoses were confirmed by surgical pathology and long-term follow-up results. The 51 masses included 43 benign and 8 malignant lesions. On 3D-CEUS images, benign lesions appeared as round structures formed by sparse and straight capillary vessels. Malignant lesions showed irregular stereo structures with dense and tortuous vascular distribution. A 3D-CEUS scoring system was established. There were no statistically significant differences in scores at each time point between the 20th and 70th seconds, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for this time period was the largest (0.995). A cut-off score of 8 was established, with scores ≥8 being suggestive of malignancy. The 3D-CEUS scoring system had a high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98%). 3D-CEUS is likely to be the new tool to distinguish malignant from benign small adnexal masses and diagnose early ovarian cancer."

Large ovarian cysts, however, have traditionally been, and continue to be treated by laparotomy. This is mainly due to technical difficulties and the possibility of malignancy. We describe four patients in whom laparoscopy was used to remove large ovarian cysts. Laparoscopic guided aspiration was performed, followed by extra-abdominal excision of the cyst. This approach has the advantages of minimising the risk of spillage of cyst fluid, a smaller incision compared to laparotomy, as well as faster recovery.

While rates of uterine rupture vary significantly according to a variety of clinically associated risk factors, the absolute risk for this complication ranges between 0.5 and 4 percent. Previous vaginal delivery and prior successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery confer the lowest risk of rupture on women attempting TOL. In contrast, multiple prior cesareans, short interpregnancy interval, single layer uterine closure, prior preterm cesarean, labor induction and augmentation have all been suggested in some studies as factors which may increase the rate of uterine rupture. While considering these risk factors is important in counseling women regarding childbirth following cesarean delivery, the infrequency of uterine rupture coupled with relatively weak associations for most risk factors has prevented the development of an accurate prediction tool for uterine rupture. Preliminary studies suggest that sonographic evaluation of the uterine scar may hold some promise for identifying women at risk."

She had a previous miscarriage due to a bicornuate uterus. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance urography confirmed an incomplete obstruction of the left upper renal tract which was relieved by percutaneous nephrostomy. She presented again at 14 weeks with renal colic and minimal output. An ultrasound confirmed recurrent hydronephrosis and a nephrostogram showed that the catheter had retracted almost completely from the collecting system. This was considered to be due to the upward pressure of the enlarging uterus on the catheter, which had been fixed externally to the skin. This problem was obviated by not securing the replacement nephrostomy tube to the skin. She developed pre-eclamptic toxaemia and gave birth at 35 weeks gestation by caesarean section.

CD011126,0,25443576,0,Virtual colon flattening method based on colonic outer surface.,"Virtual colon flattening (VF) is a minimally invasive viewing mode used to detect colorectal polyps on the colonic inner surface in virtual colonoscopy. Compared with conventional colonoscopy, inspecting a flattened colonic inner surface is faster and results in fewer uninspected regions. Unfortunately, the deformation distortions of flattened colonic inner surface impede the performance of VF. Conventionally, the deformation distortions can be corrected by using the colonic inner surface. However, colonic curvatures and haustral folds make correcting deformation distortions using only the colonic inner surface difficult. Therefore, we propose a VF method that is based on the colonic outer surface. The proposed method includes two novel algorithms, namely, the colonic outer surface extraction algorithm and the colonic outer surface-based distortion correction algorithm. Sixty scans involving 77 annotated polyps were used for the validation. The flattened colons were independently inspected by three operators and then compared with three existing VF methods. The correct detection rates of the proposed method and the three existing methods were 79.6%, 67.1%, 71.9%, and 72.7%, respectively, and the false positives per scan were 0.16, 0.32, 0.21, and 0.26, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has better performance than existing methods that are based on the colonic inner surface."

CD011126,0,23358212,0,ACR Appropriateness Criteria® clinically suspected adnexal mass.,"Adnexal masses are a common problem clinically and imaging-wise, and transvaginal US (TVUS) is the first-line imaging modality for assessing them in the vast majority of patients. The findings of US, however, should be correlated with the history and laboratory tests, as well as any patient symptoms. Simple cysts are uniformly benign, and most warrant no further interrogation or treatment. Complex cysts carry more significant implications, and usually engender serial ultrasound(s), with a minority of cases warranting a pelvic MRI.Morphological analysis of adnexal masses with gray-scale US can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Spectral Doppler analysis has not proven useful in most well-performed studies. However, the use of color Doppler sonography adds significant contributions to differentiating between benign and malignant masses and is recommended in all cases of complex masses. Malignant masses generally demonstrate neovascularity, with abnormal branching vessel morphology. Optimal sonographic evaluation is achieved by using a combination of gray-scale morphologic assessment and color or power Doppler imaging to detect flow within any solid areas.The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every two years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment."

CD011126,0,24554292,0,Speckle suppressing anisotropic diffusion filter for medical ultrasound images.,"Ultrasonography is often preferred over the other medical imaging modalities due to its noninvasive nature, cost-effectiveness, and portability. However, the resolution of the ultrasound image greatly depends upon the presence of speckle noise. Speckle noise generally tends to reduce the image resolution and contrast, thereby reducing the diagnostic resolution of this imaging modality. In this paper, we propose a speckle suppressing anisotropic diffusion (SSAD) filter, to remove the speckle noise from B-Mode Ultrasound images. The performance of the SSAD filter is compared with the existing diffusion filters. The evaluation is based on their application to images simulated by Field II (developed by Jensen et al.). The algorithms were also tested for clinical ultrasound images of polycystic ovaries obtained from HDI 5000 Ultrasound Scanner. Performance evaluation was done by both numerical and functional parameters. The proposed filter yields better results in terms of greatest structural similarity index map (SSIM) of 0.95 and accuracy of 99.5."

LMP tumors affect patients at a younger age and have a much better 5- and 20-year survival rate compared with invasive ovarian malignancy. The authors retrospectively reviewed the records and sonograms of 41 patients (51 masses) with LMP tumor of the ovary. They demonstrated a wide variety of morphologies on the presentation sonograms with six masses favored to be benign, four indeterminate, 18 likely malignant, and 23 clearly malignant. Eighteen of 51 masses (35.3%) had a unique appearance-a cyst within the ovary of small to medium size with vascular mural nodularity and preserved surrounding ovarian parenchyma. Low-level echoes within the cystic components of the mass, reminiscent of typical endometrioma, were present in 19 of 51 masses (37.2%). Peritoneal dissemination was present in six patients at presentation, all! whom were alive at follow-up between 45 and 120 months. The authors think that many LMP tumors may be recognized and treated while they are still small. Ovary-sparing surgery may preserve patient fertility. LMP tumors may present initially with a benign morphology, although temporal evolution tends to show more suspicious features. Because these tumors may also appear frankly malignant or show peritoneal dissemination, the possibility of LMP tumor must be considered in light of their much better prognosis compared with invasive ovarian malignancy."

Demystifying uterine and cervical contrast enhancement at multidetector CT.,"Computed tomography (CT) is not generally advocated as the first-line imaging examination for disorders of the female pelvis. However, multidetector CT is often the modality of choice for evaluating nongynecologic pelvic abnormalities, particularly in emergent settings, in which all the pelvic organs are invariably assessed. Incidental findings of uterine and cervical contrast enhancement in such settings may easily be mistaken for abnormalities, given the broad spectrum of anatomic variants and enhancement patterns that may be seen in the normal uterus and cervix. The authors' review of CT and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging enhancement patterns, augmented by case examples from their clinical radiology practice, provides a solid foundation for understanding the spectrum of normal uterine and cervical appearances and avoiding potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of benign cervical lesions, adenomyosis, infection, malignancy, and postpartum effects. This information should help radiologists more confidently differentiate between normal and abnormal CT findings and, when CT findings are not definitive, offer appropriate recommendations for follow-up ultrasonography or MR imaging."

CD011126,0,16229416,0,Three-dimensional reconstruction and quantification of cervical carcinoma invasion fronts from histological serial sections.,"The analysis of the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of tumoral invasion fronts of carcinoma of the uterine cervix is the prerequisite for understanding their architectural-functional relationship. The variation range of the invasion patterns known so far reaches from a smooth tumor-host boundary surface to more diffusely spreading patterns, which all are supposed to have a different prognostic relevance. As a very decisive limitation of previous studies, all morphological assessments just could be done verbally referring to single histological sections. Therefore, the intention of this paper is to get an objective quantification of tumor invasion based on 3-D reconstructed tumoral tissue data. The image processing chain introduced here is capable to reconstruct selected parts of tumor invasion fronts from histological serial sections of remarkable extent (90-500 slices). While potentially gaining good accuracy and reasonably high resolution, microtome cutting of large serial sections especially may induce severe artifacts like distortions, folds, fissures or gaps. Starting from stacks of digitized transmitted light color images, an overall of three registration steps are the main parts of the presented algorithm. By this, we achieved the most detailed 3-D reconstruction of the invasion of solid tumors so far. Once reconstructed, the invasion front of the segmented tumor is quantified using discrete compactness."

CD011126,0,17579978,0,Low-dose HCG is useful in preventing OHSS in high-risk women without adversely affecting the outcome of IVF cycles.,"Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a rare but potentially fatal condition associated with conventional IVF treatment. It is found predominantly in women with polycystic ovaries who have an exaggerated response to exogenous FSH, leading to a large number of follicles and an overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor with resultant excessive increases in vascular permeability. There is evidence to suggest that OHSS is also linked to the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) to induce ovulation. Therefore, while HCG is essential for corpus luteum function, high amounts of HCG can lead to OHSS in high responders. In a pilot study, infertile patients at high risk of developing OHSS were given half the current minimum dose of HCG (i.e. 2500 IU). No woman developed moderate or severe OHSS; 13 women (61.9%) conceived and there were three twin pregnancies. In women at high risk of OHSS, a low dose of HCG appears to prevent the development of OHSS without compromising success rates."

Immunohistochemical analysis of p57 expression, a paternally imprinted maternally expressed gene on 11p15.5, and molecular genotyping are useful for improving diagnosis. CHMs are characterized by androgenetic diploidy, with loss of p57 expression due to lack of maternal DNA. Loss of p57 expression distinguishes CHMs from both PHMs (diandric triploidy) and nonmolar specimens (biparental diploidy), which retain expression. We report a unique HM characterized by morphologic features suggesting an early CHM, including lack of p57 expression by immunohistochemistry, but with genetic features more in keeping with a PHM. Specifically, molecular genotyping by short tandem repeat markers provided evidence to support interpretation as a PHM by demonstrating allele patterns and ratios most consistent with diandric triploidy, with evidence of loss of the maternal copy of chromosome 11 to explain the lack of p57 expression. This case illustrates the value of combined traditional pathologic and ancillary molecular techniques for refined diagnosis of molar specimens. It also raises questions regarding which modalities should be used to ultimately define the subtypes of HMs and whether chromosomal losses or gains, particularly involving imprinted genes such as p57, might play a role in modifying risk of persistent GTD."

CD011126,0,17001559,0,[Diagnostic and preoperative staging of endometrial carcinoma with transvaginal sonography--a review].,"Endometrial carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract. The major non-invasive diagnostic method is ultrasound. Endometrial thickness (double layer) is measured by transvaginal sonography. The cut-off value in patients with postmenopausal bleeding is still controversial, although in patients with endometrial thickness below 4 mm (or 5 mm respectively), malignancy can be excluded with high probability. If the endometrium measures more than 4 mm (or more than 5 mm respectively) or the patient presents with continuous bleeding, hysteroscopy and curettage should be performed in order to obtain histologic diagnosis. Sonographic findings like structure and demarcation of the endometrium increase diagnostic specificity only when combined with the measurement of endometrial thickness. Measuring the fluid within the uterine cavity does not seem to be useful in differentiating malignant from benign disorders. The extent of surgery depends on the preoperative estimation of the tumor stage which is particularly important for elder patients with increased morbidity. Transvaginal sonography has not been widely accepted to predict the depth of myometrial invasion or cervical infiltration. Although promising studies exist, additional examinations have to be done in order to determine the role of transvaginal sonography beside other methods (CT, MRT).

Eleven patients with cancer of the endometrium were treated with CT-compatible HDR intracavitary Rotte 'Y' applicators (Nucletron) and underwent post-implant pelvic CT scans with applicators in place. All patients were treated using orthogonal radiography-based planning. The dose was prescribed to uterine point (a point located 2 cm below the center of a line drawn between the tips of the two ends of the Rotte applicator extending laterally from the tandem by half the maximum uterine width), Point A, and 0.5 cm depth along the upper 3 cm vagina. CT-images were transferred to the PLATO treatment planning system version 14.2.6 and retrospectively planned for volumetric calculations. The clinical target volume (CTV) included the entire uterus, cervix, and upper 3 cm of vagina. The volumes of organs at risk (OAR) were digitized. Dwell positions were identified and registered in both the uterine tandem for each patient. For those receiving HDRB alone, the prescribed dose was 7 Gy x 5 fractions. Patients who were treated following external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) received 4 Gy x 5 fractions. The interfraction interval was 6-8 hours. The DVHs were computed for the CTV, bladder, rectum, and sigmoid colon. To compare doses of OARs, 1.0 cc, 2.0 cc, and 5.0 cc volumes receiving the highest dose were calculated from DVHs. 3D optimization was done to improve target coverage and decrease dose to critical organs and compared with the 2D orthogonal radiograph-based plan. The mean of percentage of prescribed dose +/- S.D to 1 cc, 2 cc, and 5 cc of the OARs of interest were as follows: Rectum 44 +/- 21%, 39 +/- 18%, and 33 +/- 15%; bladder 104 +/- 36%, 91 +/- 31%, and 73.9 +/- 24%; and sigmoid 124 +/- 35%, 109 +/- 30%, and 89 +/- 25%, respectively. The corresponding dose to ICRU 38 bladder and rectal points were 98 +/- 55% and 50.5 +/- 32%, respectively. The mean dose to uterine point and point A were 99 +/- 1.7% and 98 +/- 3%, respectively. The mean CTV volume was 160 +/- 89 cc with the percentage of volume getting 100% and 90% of the dose being 62 +/- 12% and 68 +/- 12% with 2D plan versus 57 +/- 8% and 67 +/- 8.9% with 3D plan. The dose to critical organs were reduced with 3D optimization for rectum, bladder, and sigmoid by 5.6% (p = 0.04), 20.6% (p = 0.02), and 26.8% (p = 0.005), respectively. Compared to the 3-D volume dose, the prescription points overestimated the dose to the target volume. The under-dosing was because of inability of two channel applicator to cover volumes in the region of the cervix and vagina. The dose to sigmoid colon was high and attention should be given to the sigmoid dose at the time of treatment planning. 3D planning helped in reducing the dose to the critical organs without compromising target coverage. Correlations with outcome are needed to better define the role of 3D dosimetry in treatment planning."

CD011126,0,24095898,0,Visualizing compaction of polysomes in bacteria.,"During protein synthesis, many translating ribosomes are bound together with an mRNA molecule to form polysomes (or polyribosomes). While the spatial organization of bacterial polysomes has been well studied in vitro, little is known about how they cluster when cellular conditions are highly constrained. To better understand this, we used electron tomography, template matching, and three-dimensional modeling to analyze the supramolecular network of ribosomes after induction of translational pauses. In Escherichia coli, we overexpressed an mRNA carrying a polyproline motif known to induce pausing during translation. When working with a strain lacking transfer-messenger RNA, the principle actor in the ""trans-translation"" rescuing system, the cells survived the hijacking of the translation machinery but this resulted in a sharp modification of the ribosomal network. The results of our experiments demonstrate that single ribosomes are replaced with large amounts of compacted polysomes. These polysomes are highly organized, principally forming hairpins and dimers of hairpins that stack together. We propose that these spatial arrangements help maintain translation efficiency when the rescue systems are absent or overwhelmed."

CD011126,0,24812585,0,Manual removal of the placenta after vaginal delivery: an unsolved problem in obstetrics.,"The third stage of labor is associated with considerable maternal morbidity and mortality. The major complication is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), which is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Whereas in the event of PPH due to atony of the uterus there exist numerous treatment guidelines; for the management of retained placenta the general consensus is more difficult to establish. Active management of the third stage of labour is generally accepted as standard of care as already its duration is contributing to the risk of PPH. Despite scant evidence it is commonly advised that if the placenta has not been expelled 30 minutes after delivery, manual removal of the placenta should be carried out under anaesthesia. Pathologic adhesion of the placenta in the low risk situation usually is diagnosed at the time of delivery; therefore a pre- or intrapartum screening opportunity for placenta accreta would be desirable. But diagnosis of abnormalities of placentation other than placenta previa remains a challenge. Nevertheless the use of ultrasound and doppler sonography might be helpful in the third stage of labor. An improvement might be the implementation of standardized operating procedures for retained placenta which could contribute to a reduction of maternal morbidity."
CD011126,0,18724995,0,Anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody conjugated polymer fluorescent nanoparticles probe for ovarian cancer imaging.,"Fluorescent nanoparticles (FNPs) with unique optical properties may be useful as biosensors in living cancer cell imaging and cancer targeting. A novel kind of polymer fluorescent nanoparticles (PFNPs) was synthesized and its application for ovarian cancer imaging with fluorescence microscopy imaging technology was presented in this study. The PFNPs were synthesized with precipitation polymerization by using methacrylic acid (MAA) as monomer, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (Trim) as cross-linker, azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as radical initiator and butyl rhodamine B (BTRB) as fluorescent dye. And the fluorescent dye was embedded into the three-dimensional network of the polymer when the polymer was produced. With this method the PFNPs can be prepared easily. And then the PFNPs were successfully modified with anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody. The fluorescence probe based on anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody conjugated PFNPs has been used to detect ovarian cancer cells with fluorescence microscopy imaging technology. The experimental results demonstrate that the anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody conjugated PFNPs can effectively recognize ovarian cancer cells and exhibit good sensitivity and exceptional photostability, which would provide a novel way for the diagnosis and curative effect observation of ovarian cancer cells."

During this procedure a certain level of discomfort and pain are experienced by patients. On the basis of reducing avoidable pain inductors the aim of this study was to compare pain sensation due to different warmth of applied contrasts (sterile saline and Echovist(®)). Prospective and randomized study was performed on patients requiring tubal and uterine assessment during standard infertility work up. One group of patients was examined using both contrasts at room temperature and the other group using preheated contrasts at body temperature. Pain experience of the procedure was rated by patients for each contrast by numerical scale (0-10) immediately after the procedure. There was significant statistical difference between pain scores during application of two contrasts in each group; Echovist induces significantly less pain in comparison to sterile saline at the same temperature (P=0.002, 0.001). Between two groups there is also statistically significant difference in pain during introduction of the same contrast at different temperature (P<0.001). The most tolerable for the patient is body temperature of the applied contrasts although their structure and concentrations can be another factor associated with tolerability of the procedure."

We used utrastructural studies to shed light on the different steps of the Mimivirus replication cycle: entry via phagocytosis, release of viral DNA into the cell cytoplasm through fusion of viral and vacuolar membranes, and finally viral morphogenesis in an extraordinary giant cytoplasmic virus factory (VF). Fluorescent staining of the AT-rich Mimivirus DNA showed that it enters the host nucleus prior to the generation of a cytoplasmic independent replication centre that forms the core of the VF. Assembly and filling of viral capsids were observed within the replication centre, before release into the cell cytoplasm where progeny virions accumulated. 3D reconstruction from fluorescent and differential contrast interference images revealed the VF emerging from the cell surface as a volcano-like structure. Its size dramatically grew during the 24 h infectious lytic cycle. Our results showed that Mimivirus replication is an extremely efficient process that results from a rapid takeover of cellular machinery, and takes place in a unique and autonomous giant assembly centre, leading to the release of a large number of complex virions through amoebal lysis."

Three years earlier he had presented elsewhere with left unilateral gynaecomastia. A hypertrophic mammary gland had been excised one year later. Histopathological investigation showed benign hypertrophy. One year later he developed gynaecomastia on the other side. Physical examination and incomplete hormonal screening showed no abnormalities. The couple were referred to our tertiary clinic for ICSI treatment. The patient still had unilateral gynaecomastia. Hormonal screening showed not only severe oligoasthenoteratospermia, but also an elevated serum oestrogen level. Scrotal ultrasound revealed a 17 mm mass in his right testicle. Subsequently unilateral orchidectomy was performed. Histology showed a benign Leydig cell tumour for which no further therapy was required. Four months after surgery the gynaecomastia diminished, oestrogen levels became normal and improvement in semen parameters followed. Patients with severe male infertility or gynaecomastia are at a higher risk of developing a testicular neoplasm.

A total of 32 consecutive patients referred for chemotherapy were recruited. Twenty-three non-pregnant and 18 women in the first trimester of pregnancy acted as controls. The patients were prospectively followed-up for 2 years. It was found that the uterine arterial resistance index and pulsatility index in patients who required chemotherapy were significantly lower when compared with the non-pregnant and pregnant controls; (Student t-test; P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Stepwise regression analysis of beta-hCG titres on uterine artery resistance index showed significant correlation, after controlling for uterine volume (adjusted multiple R = 0.71, P < 0.00001). There were, however, no significant independent associations between the initial uterine artery resistance index and the need for chemotherapy, number of courses of chemotherapy required, duration required for the beta-hCG titre to return to normal, presence of metastatic disease, or the subsequent development of drug resistance or relapse. It was concluded that uterine arterial Doppler indices are significantly correlated with trophoblastic activity (beta-hCG titres) in malignant trophoblastic disease. However, their role in the prediction of subsequent tumour behaviour need to be assessed in larger series."

CD011126,0,22296972,0,Targeted gonadotrophin stimulation using the PIVET algorithm markedly reduces the risk of OHSS.,"PIVET Medical Centre has developed an empirical algorithm for the dose of FSH administration based upon day-2 FSH, antral follicle count, anti-Müllerian hormone, body mass index, age and smoking parameters in an attempt to reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome particularly in at-risk women with elevated antral follicle count and anti-Müllerian hormone. The algorithm utilized the incremental dosage capabilities of the recombinant FSH pens to fine-tune the daily concentration of FSH. Application of the algorithm aimed to minimize any form of excessive follicle recruitment that necessitated increased clinical awareness. The measure used to assess the impact of the algorithm was the number of women who, after oocyte retrieval, were considered to be potentially at risk of any degree of OHSS and were allocated to increased monitoring. Compared with the previous 20-month period, introduction of the algorithm significantly reduced both the incidence of referral for increased monitoring, treatment for OHSS and the incidence of freeze-all cycles (all P < 0.05). This was particularly focused on those considered to be at risk without reducing the fresh cycle pregnancy rate."

CD011126,0,23768623,0,Removal of unilateral endometriomas is associated with immediate and sustained reduction in ovarian reserve.,"Endometrioma surgery by stripping the cyst capsule has been associated with a reduction in ovarian reserve. It is still not clear whether the inflicted damage is immediate, sustained over time or associated with the use of electrocautery, nor which marker is more accurately reflects the post-operative reduction in ovarian reserve. This observational study assessed the damage inflicted by endometrioma removal with anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentration and antral follicle count (AFC) pre and post-operatively. Twenty-five women with unilateral endometrioma underwent laparoscopic stripping of the endometrioma cyst capsule. There was a significant decrease both in AMH concentration (24%) and in AFC (11%) 1 month following surgery (P<0.01). At 6months post-operatively, the respective values were 24% and 15% less than preoperatively. AMH concentration and AFC showed no correlation with the use of bipolar electrocautery during surgery. Primordial follicles embedded adjacent to the cyst capsule were found in 61.5% of the specimens.

Purified chitin synthase I-containing vesicles (chitosomes) with a diameter of 85 to 120 nm are identified by electron microscopy to eject tiny fibers upon addition of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The filigree of extruded filaments fused gradually into a large three-dimensional network, which is degradable by a chitinase. The network is targeted and restructured by the Streptomyces chitin-binding protein CHB1, which has a very high affinity only for alpha-chitin. Within the chitosomes, filaments are found to be highly condensed within consecutive oval fibroids, which are specifically targeted by the alpha-chitin-binding protein. The presented data give new insights to the generation of chitin filaments with an antiparallel (alpha) configuration. [image: see text]"

We found elevated oestrogen levels in five patients and failure of gonadotropin response to GnRH stimulation in four patients during the first episode, of the disease. In one patient, a GnRH stimulation test was not performed. Pelvic ultrasound examination showed large ovarian cysts in all ten patients. Following the initial episode the secondary sexual characteristics of nine patients regressed completely without treatment. The cyst of one girl was removed surgically on demand of her parents. Three girls presented recurrent autonomous ovarian cysts. Two of these girls developed central precocious puberty requiring treatment with a GnRH-agonist after repeated episodes of precocious pseudopuberty. We started treating the third girl with a GnRH agonist after the second relapse of the autonomous ovarian cyst because of rapidly advancing bone age. We conclude that in the majority of cases autonomous ovarian cysts regress spontaneously and that surgery is in general not indicated. Furthermore, autonomous ovarian cysts can relapse before the onset of physiological puberty and accelerate biological maturation leading to central precocious puberty and consequent decrease of height potential."

With advances in diagnostics, more tests are available, such as hysterosalpingo contrast sonography (HyCoSy) and Chlamydia antibody titre (CAT) are available. The CAT test is much cheaper, less invasive and can be performed at any time during the cycle. The CAT test can also be used as a means of identifying which patients need further evaluation. HyCoSy has same diagnostic accuracy as HSG, without exposing women to radiation. We argue that HSG is out of date and has no place in a modern infertility evaluation.

CD011126,0,23065168,0,Imaging strategy for early ovarian cancer: characterization of adnexal masses with conventional and advanced imaging techniques.,"Early detection of ovarian cancer remains crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, early-stage disease is often asymptomatic, and population screening is currently unproven. Adnexal masses may be incidentally detected, but most are identified at ultrasonography (US) in patients who are symptomatic, and most may be characterized as benign or malignant. Indices are available to estimate the risk of malignancy on the basis of clinical and US findings. However, adnexal masses remain indeterminate in some cases, with some benign lesions demonstrating features of malignancy at US. In these cases, use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging improves the ability to characterize adnexal masses and reduces the number of indeterminate lesions. Establishing the likelihood of malignancy on the basis of imaging features is important to the preoperative detection of early ovarian cancer and profoundly influences referral and management pathways. Conventional and contrast material-enhanced MR imaging are used to evaluate morphologic features, including lesion complexity, signal intensity, and enhancement of solid areas. At dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging with semiquantitative analysis, early enhancement characteristics may help differentiate some complex benign and malignant lesions. Diffusion-weighted imaging has a limited but useful role in evaluating adnexal masses: Those with a hypointense solid area on both diffusion-weighted (b = 1000 sec/mm²) and T2-weighted images are likely benign, whereas those that are hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images (b = 1000 sec/mm²) with intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted images are likely malignant."

CD011126,0,17948757,0,[Pelvic tumors in the eyes of urologists].,"Pelvic tumors originating from outside the urinary tract commonly invade the urogenital organs by direct extension mainly because of the close relationships between the pelvic organs. Benign tumors such as endometrial myoma, ovarian cyst and adenoma of the colon might lead to the development of urogenital symptoms. This is also the case with malignant tumors of the uterus, ovaries, cervix and colon where infiltration of the urogenital organs might be noted. The most commonly mentioned symptoms involve incontinence, infections, obstructive symptoms, and in terminal cases those of renal failure. These are the symptoms that lead to the diagnosis of the primary tumor. It has to be kept in mind that urogenital tumors with such symptoms have to be included in the differential diagnosis. The therapeutic measures are directed at first to relieve the symptoms before intending to deal with the causative source. An example is the development of hydronephrosis, where the initial measure has to be the immediate relief of the obstruction through draining of either the kidney or the urinary bladder.

CD011126,0,25437110,0,Multi-modal detection of colon malignancy by NIR-tagged recognition polymers and ultrasound contrast agents.,"To increase colonoscopy capability to discriminate benign from malignant polyps, we suggest combining two imaging approaches based on targeted polymeric platforms. Water-soluble cationized polyacrylamide (CPAA) was tagged with the near infrared (NIR) dye IR-783-S-Ph-COOH to form Flu-CPAA. The recognition peptide VRPMPLQ (reported to bind specifically to CRC tissues) was then conjugated with the Flu-CPAA to form Flu-CPAA-Pep which was then incorporated into echogenic microbubbles (MBs) made of polylactic acid (PLA) that are highly responsive to ultrasound. The ultimate design includes intravenous administration combined with local ultrasound and intra-colon inspection at the NIR range. In this proof of principle study PLA MBs were prepared by the double emulsion technique and loaded with several types of Flu-CPAA-Pep polymers. After insonation the submicron PLA fragments (SPF)-containing Flu-CPAA-Pep were examined in vitro for their ability to attach to colon cancer cells and in vivo (DMH induced rat model) for their ability to attach to colon malignant tissues and compared to the specific attachment of the free Flu-CPAA-Pep.

CD011126,0,17934309,0,Uterine receptivity and cytokines: new concepts and new applications.,"The implantation process, currently thought to be the most critical step in achieving a successful early pregnancy, remains one of the most important unsolved processes in reproductive medicine. It depends on uterine-dependent and embryo-specific events, which need to be critically coordinated. Early embryo signaling following a maternal hormonal or cytokine-mediated preparation phase seems to be involved in stages immediately before, during and just after the apposition step to permit adequate proliferation of the stroma. Our objective is to develop guidelines and diagnostic tools pertinent to appreciate uterine receptivity. We will focus our attention on the uterine luminal environment at the time of oocyte retrieval and on the monitoring of the endometrium using three-dimensional ultrasound associated with digital technology and cytokine quantification by real-time PCR during the implantation window in an IVF/ICSI population. There is an accumulating body of data which strongly suggests that both implantation and uterine receptivity are controlled, primarily, though not exclusively, by locally acting growth factors and cytokines, some under steroid control. Some specific cytokines (IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18) in the luminal environment and in the endometrium allow a distinct pattern of abnormal uterine receptivity. The identification of these distinct patterns of abnormal uterine receptivity and of the mechanisms leading to the abnormal angiogenesis before implantation strongly suggest that no single therapeutic scheme can correct all cases of implantation failure and should be adapted for each patient especially in the case of unexplained infertility."

Thickening of the plantar fascia insertion more than 5 mm either on ultrasound or MRI is suggestive of plantar fasciopathy. Ultrasound is superior to MRI for diagnosis of plantar fibroma as small low signal lesions on MRI are similar to the normal plantar fascia signal. Ultrasound demonstrates low echogenicity compared with the echogenic plantar fascia. Penetrating injuries can appear bizarre due to associated foreign body impaction and infection.

CD011126,0,22776244,0,Treatment options and recommendations to reduce preterm births in women with short cervix.,"Premature shortening of the cervix, or short cervix, is the most predictive risk factor for preterm birth. Results of clinical studies of interventions to prevent preterm birth have shown that identifying at-risk women on the basis of cervical length versus obstetric history alone improves the likelihood of timely interventions with cervical cerclage or progesterone supplementation, improving outcomes. Debate continues over the use of cerclage; however, results of a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials provide evidence to support its use in women who have history of prior preterm birth and who develop short cervix before 24 weeks' gestation. Results of the recent PREGNANT trial, consistent with the earlier Fetal Medicine Foundation study, support the use of vaginal progesterone for prevention of preterm birth. In women identified by transvaginal ultrasound to have short cervix (10-20 mm) in midtrimester, daily vaginal progesterone gel reduced the risk of preterm birth before 33 weeks' gestation by 45% and before 28 weeks' gestation by 50%. Occurrence of any morbidity and mortality event also was significantly reduced by 43%, with a 61% reduction in the rate of respiratory distress syndrome in infants born to women receiving vaginal progesterone gel versus those receiving placebo. The safety profile of progesterone treatment in early pregnancy is well established, and studies of vaginal progesterone for prevention of preterm birth have identified no additional safety issues. Adverse events were comparable between women receiving progesterone and those receiving placebo. Recent guidelines issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend vaginal progesterone in women with no prior spontaneous preterm birth and cervical length of 20 mm or less at 24 weeks' gestation or earlier. Future studies will refine strategies for prevention of preterm birth to address other risk factors and determine the role of other interventions."
CD011126,0,19473717,0,Object density-based image segmentation and its applications in biomedical image analysis.,"In many applications of medical image analysis, the density of an object is the most important feature for isolating an area of interest (image segmentation). In this research, an object density-based image segmentation methodology is developed, which incorporates intensity-based, edge-based and texture-based segmentation techniques. The proposed method consists of three main stages: preprocessing, object segmentation and final segmentation. Image enhancement, noise reduction and layer-of-interest extraction are several subtasks of preprocessing. Object segmentation utilizes a marker-controlled watershed technique to identify each object of interest (OI) from the background. A marker estimation method is proposed to minimize over-segmentation resulting from the watershed algorithm. Object segmentation provides an accurate density estimation of OI which is used to guide the subsequent segmentation steps. The final stage converts the distribution of OI into textural energy by using fractal dimension analysis. An energy-driven active contour procedure is designed to delineate the area with desired object density. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 98% accurate in segmenting synthetic images. Segmentation of microscopic images and ultrasound images shows the potential utility of the proposed method in different applications of medical image processing."

CD011126,0,24830595,0,Polycystic ovary syndrome: reviewing diagnosis and management of metabolic disturbances.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition in women at reproductive age associated with reproductive and metabolic dysfunction. Proposed diagnosed criteria for PCOS include two out of three features: androgen excess, menstrual irregularity, and polycystic ovary appearance on ultrasound (PCO), after other causes of hyperandrogenism and dysovulation are excluded. Based on these diagnostic criteria, the most common phenotypes are the ""classic PCOS""--hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea, with or without PCO; the ""ovulatory phenotype""--hyperandrogenism and PCO in ovulatory women; and the ""non-hyperandrogenic phenotype"", in which there is oligomenorrhea and PCO, without overt hyperandrogenism. The presence of obesity may exacerbate the metabolic and reproductive disorders associated with the syndrome. In addition, PCOS women present higher risk for type 2 diabetes and higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors that seems to be associated with the classic phenotype. The main interventions to minimize cardiovascular and metabolic risks in PCOS are lifestyle changes, pharmacological therapy, and bariatric surgery. Treatment with metformin has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, lowering blood glucose and androgen levels. These effects are more potent when combined with lifestyle interventions. In conclusion, besides reproductive abnormalities, PCOS has been associated to metabolic comorbidities, most of them linked to obesity. Confounders, such as the lack of standard diagnostic criteria, heterogeneity of the clinical presentation, and presence of obesity, make management of PCOS difficult. Therefore, the approach to metabolic abnormalities should be tailored to the risks and treatment goals of each individual woman."

Early ovarian cancer-associated symptoms constitute a constellation of mostly nongynecological complaints, suggesting a visceral disturbance, which do not point immediately to a pelvic origin. Abdominal bloating and pain predominate with recent onset and multiple symptomatic episodes. Gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms and fatigue/malaise may be part of the symptom complex. Women aged 50 years and older with this constellation of symptoms should have medical evaluation and, if symptoms are unexplained or persist, should undergo pelvic imaging (e.g., transvaginal ultrasound) and serum CA125."

The simulated bleeding is required to be visually appealing while at the same time instantaneously responsive to any feedback that the surgeon may be conducing to the virtual environment. In order to meet these real-time requirements, we have based the simulation on graphical fluid solvers. These solvers primarily work best over a 2D domain. For correct visualization in the hysteroscopic simulator, it is, however, necessary to perform the simulation fully in 3D. Therefore in this paper we also present the design modifications for 3D graphical fluid solving and show how to use parallelization to maintain real-time behavior. We also discuss how the incorporation of massless particles into the simulation can improve the visual quality of the results by limiting numerical dissipation effects."
CD011126,0,21735341,0,Effect of the administration of GnRH or hCG on time of ovulation and the onset of estrus-to-ovulation interval in sows in Thailand.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the control of ovulation by the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) at the onset of estrus. Thirty-three multiparous sows housed under tropical conditions and showing standing estrus within 5 days after weaning were included. The sows were allocated to three groups, spontaneous ovulation (control group, n = 10), induced ovulation using 750 IU hCG (hCG group, n = 10), and induced ovulation using 50 μg GnRH (GnRH group, n = 13). The hormones were given at the onset of estrus and the occurrence of ovulation was monitored every 6 h by transrectal ultrasonography. Data for weaning-to-estrus interval, onset of estrus-to-ovulation interval (EOI), and the length of estrus were recorded. All sows in the control and hCG groups ovulated, while 3 out of 13 sows treated with GnRH developed cystic ovaries (did not ovulate). Of those sows ovulating, the EOI of the hCG (40.2 ± 1.7 h) and GnRH (37.5 ± 3.3 h) groups were shorter than that of the control group (63.6 ± 9.6 h; P < 0.05). In conclusion, the administration of either hCG or GnRH at the onset of estrus can control time of ovulation but, at the dose employed, sows receiving GnRH may develop ovarian cysts."

CD011126,0,20819417,0,Assessment of transvaginal sonography combined with endometrial cytology as a mass screening method for endometrial cancer in Beijing.,"This was a two-phase, large sample-group study assessing the effectiveness of combined transvaginal sonography (TVS) and endometrial cytology in endometrial cancer screening. In phase one, 3308 women without known cancer were enrolled and TVS was performed on those with symptoms or endometrial cancer risk factors. Endometrial cytology was carried out on post-menopausal women with endometrial thickness >or= 5 mm and on pre-menopausal women with endometrial thickness >or= 10 mm. Dilation and curettage (D & C) was performed if cytological findings were inconclusive, or indicated cancer or pre-cancer. The mass screening safety interval is at least 2 years and phase two was carried out 2 years after phase one, using the same procedures, on the 3305 women who were originally found to be cancer free. Combined TVS and endometrial cytology resulted in 100% sensitivity and 99.0% specificity, reducing unnecessary D & C by 91.7% and screening costs by 20.1%. Combined TVS examination and endometrial cytology decreased potentially harmful examinations, patient suffering and medical costs, and is worth considering for broad implementation."

CD011126,0,21746796,0,The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for early detection of ovarian cancer: the pivotal role of the clinical laboratory.,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently reviewed optimal means of early recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer, the leading cause of gynaecological death in the UK. The NICE guidelines state that general practitioners should measure serum CA125 in women presenting with persistent and continuous symptoms suggestive of ovarian cancer (e.g. abdominal distension, early satiety and loss of appetite or pelvic pain). If CA125 is ≥35 kU/L, the general practitioner should arrange an ultrasound scan of the abdomen and pelvis to enable calculation of the risk of malignancy score (RMI). Women with an RMI score of ≥250 should then be referred to a specialist multidisciplinary team. Successful implementation of these guidelines requires close liaison between primary care and laboratory medicine to ensure that CA125 is requested as a diagnostic aid only for women meeting the criteria stated in the guidelines. Preanalytical criteria must also be met and it is essential that both requestors and patients be aware of other possible causes of increases in CA125, as well as the fact that it is not raised in all patients with ovarian cancer. Guidance is being prepared to enable appropriate interpretation and implementation of the NICE guidelines. Continuous audit of the outcomes will also be essential to determine the effectiveness of this approach to early detection of ovarian cancer."

CD011126,0,19422863,0,Endometrial cancer--current state of the art therapies and unmet clinical needs: the role of surgery and preoperative radiographic assessment.,"Endometrial carcinoma is the fourth most common cancer among women in the United States. Surgical pathologic staging has been the standard of care since 1988, which consists of analysis of collected peritoneal fluid, hysterectomy/oophorectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. In 2005, it was further recommended that essentially all women with endometrial cancer who choose to undergo surgery have pelvic and para-aortic lymph node analysis. Despite this recommendation, there still remains controversy as to whether all patients with endometrial cancer should undergo full lymph node dissection. In this review, we assess the evidence surrounding this controversy and conclude that women with endometrial cancer should undergo complete lymphadenectomy at the time of surgery. Furthermore, we evaluate the evidence regarding laparoscopic surgical staging as a safe and effective alternative to the more invasive traditional laparotomy. Finally, for those patients who a gynecologic oncologist is not readily available to perform a complete lymph node dissection, we evaluate the various imaging studies and their utility as preoperative triage modalities."

CD011126,0,17478123,0,Treatment of uterine fibroids for abnormal uterine bleeding: myomectomy and uterine artery embolization.,"Uterine myoma is a common benign tumour in women and most cases do not require treatment. Excessive uterine bleeding is usually due to a submucous myoma or an intramural myoma that is encroaching into the uterine cavity. After eliminating endometrial malignancy, perimenopausal women could be managed expectantly or with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist until menopause. Hysteroscopic myomectomy is highly effective in controlling menorrhagia that is related to submucous myoma. Concomitant endometrial ablation improves menorrhagia; however, the subsequent hysterectomy rate remains the same. For those with an intramural myoma, abdominal myomectomy results in good bleeding control. It could also be done by laparoscopic approach; however, the surgeon should have expertise in laparoscopic suturing and the uterine incision should be properly sutured. In women who have completed their family, hysterectomy remains the most effective treatment for excessive uterine bleeding. Compared with uterine artery embolization (UAE), it is associated with better improvement in pelvic pain. Nevertheless, UAE is a good alternative to hysterectomy."

CD011126,0,18409587,0,[New preoperative imaging and navigation systems for the treatment of colorectal cancer].,"Recently, many new preoperative imaging and navigation systems for the treatment of colorectal cancer have become available based on highly developed imaging hardware, software, and clinical techniques. In this paper, we describe and review the clinical role of these new methods. Computed tomography colonography (3D-CT) is a feasible and accurate method to diagnose the location, degree of invasion, and presence of extracolonic metastases in colorectal cancer. 3D-CT with CT angiography is also helpful to assess the vascular branching anatomy before and during surgery. With the use of polyethylene glycol solution plus contrast medium bowel preparation, 3D-CT shows the total colon without blind spots and good differentiation between polyps and residual fluid because the residual fluid is tagged with contrast medium. Magnetic resonance (MR) colonography and diffusion-weighted MR imaging provide additional preoperative information without radiation exposure. Positron-emission tomography/CT colonography has the potential to become an accepted technique for evaluation of the nonvisualized part of the colon caused by stenosis and it can increase the diagnostic yield of masses and clinically important polyps in this part of the colon. Although further prospective randomized trials are needed, sentinel node mapping and detection of micrometastases may be clinically relevant in colorectal cancer and may improve the selection of patients for chemotherapy."

Retrospective analysis of non-elective cerclage divided by clinical presentation: (1) bulging membranes with symptoms (n =19); (2) bulging membranes without symptoms (n =13); (3) asymptomatic ultrasound indicated were cerclage (n =23). Data from Group 1 and Group 2 were analysed retrospectively for average prolongation of pregnancy and delivery before 32 weeks. Average prolongation of pregnancy (suture to delivery interval) was significantly shorter in the group with symptoms compared with the group without symptoms (43 vs 89, p <0.01). Delivery before 32 weeks was also significantly higher in the group with symptoms compared with the group without symptoms (79% vs 31%, p <0.05). Emergency and ultrasound indicated cerclage are best performed prior to symptoms. Women at high risk of pre-term birth may benefit from transvaginal ultrasound surveillance."
CD011126,0,15191141,0,Surface normal overlap: a computer-aided detection algorithm with application to colonic polyps and lung nodules in helical CT.,We developed a novel computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithm called the surface normal overlap method that we applied to colonic polyp detection and lung nodule detection in helical computed tomography (CT) images. We demonstrate some of the theoretical aspects of this algorithm using a statistical shape model. The algorithm was then optimized on simulated CT data and evaluated using a per-lesion cross-validation on 8 CT colonography datasets and on 8 chest CT datasets. It is able to achieve 100% sensitivity for colonic polyps 10 mm and larger at 7.0 false positives (FPs)/dataset and 90% sensitivity for solid lung nodules 6 mm and larger at 5.6 FP/dataset.
CD011126,0,25337847,0,The performance of transrectal ultrasound in the diagnosis of seminal vesicle defects: a comparison with magnetic resonance imaging.,"Obstructive azoospermia (OA) is one of the most common causes of male infertility. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) has been used to diagnose OA for many years. From 2009 to 2013, we evaluated a prospective cohort of 1249 patients with suspected OA using TRUS. It was found that dilation of the ejaculatory duct (ED) (29.9%, 374/1249) was the most common cause of OA, followed by seminal vesicle (SV) abnormalities (28.5%, 356/1249). A total of 237 patients were diagnosed with congenital defects (agenesis and/or hypoplasia) of the SV, constituting more than half of the cases of SV disease in OA (19.0%, 237/1249). In contrast to ED, congenital defects of the SV could not be corrected with surgical treatment. Therefore, it is meaningful to compare TRUS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for accurate diagnosis of SV defects. Among our patients, 30 with agenesis or/and hypoplasia of the SV on TRUS were further evaluated using pelvic MRI within 2 years, with the objective of verifying the TRUS results. The concordance rate for diagnosing congenital defects of the SV was 73.3% (22/30). We concluded that TRUS is a reliable and convenient method for diagnosing agenesis or hypoplasia of the SV in OA patients with a high concordance with MRI while MRI is useful in patients with inconclusive TRUS findings."

CD011126,0,18504699,0,Polycystic ovary syndrome: the controversy of diagnosis by ultrasound.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder. The criteria used to establish the diagnosis remain controversial. The 1990 National Institutes of Health conference guidelines required a combination of both chronic anovulation and clinical/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism. These criteria were revised in 2003 at the Rotterdam European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society of Reproductive Medicine consensus workshop to include ultrasound polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) as one of the two of three criteria necessary for establishing the diagnosis of PCOS. The inclusion of PCOM sparked a controversy as it broadens the population of women who meet the criteria for PCOS and allows for the creation of two phenotypically different patient populations who previously would have been excluded. The ultrasound findings, which are consistent with PCOM, include an assessment of follicle number and/or ovarian volume. As technology advances with two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasound, our ability to discretely evaluate independent portions of the ovary may help to redefine the criteria of PCOM and thus standardize for clinical and research interests a more specific descriptor for PCOM."

CD011126,0,23427027,0,Preparation and characterization of novel elastin-like polypeptide-collagen composites.,"Collagen-based biomaterials suffer from poor mechanical properties and rapid degradation. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) possess good biocompatibility and have unique solution properties that allow them to coacervate above a critical temperature. The objective of this research was to prepare a series of freeze dried ELP-collagen composite scaffolds as a proof of concept. Combination of ELP and collagen has the potential to produce composite structures with varying strengths. Four different composite structures were prepared by varying the ratio of ELP to collagen. Increased ELP content in the scaffolds appears to have reduced the residual water content based on Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Scanning electron microscopy images of ELP-collagen composites showed a three-dimensional, open porous structure with the formation of characteristic aggregates of ELP. The mechanical testing experiments showed that the elastic modulus, tensile strength, and toughness of ELP-collagen scaffolds were significantly greater than neat collagen scaffolds. The improved mechanical properties were attributed to a homogeneous network structure with additional reinforcement coming from the ELP aggregates. Our study confirms that ELP-collagen composites with superior physical and mechanical properties compared to collagen scaffolds can be produced. Further optimization of design parameters will allow producing ELP-collagen composites for specific biomedical applications."

CD011126,0,18504697,0,Congenital malformations of the uterus: the role of ultrasound.,"Congenital uterine anomalies in women often do not cause any symptoms, except when there is an obstruction of the uterine outflow tract, which occurs infrequently. Patients with congenital uterine anomalies often go undetected or are only discovered incidentally during an evaluation for something else. Consequently, it is difficult to determine the prevalence of congenital uterine anomalies in the general population, and it appears more frequently in certain populations, namely in those with recurrent pregnancy loss or infertility. This paper will review the pathogenesis of congenital uterine anomalies and the standard classification for these anomalies. We will focus on ultrasound and other diagnostic modalities (hysterosalpingogram, laparoscopy with hysteroscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging). We will compare the accuracy and differences between these diagnostic techniques. With the development of three-dimensional ultrasound, the diagnosis of congenital uterine anomalies can be made accurately, effectively, and with less invasiveness than with other procedures. We will briefly review the treatments and pregnancy outcomes in these different anomalies."
CD011126,0,18504696,0,Ultrasound assessment of the ovary in the infertile woman.,"Few would argue that the introduction of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) revolutionized the practice of assisted reproduction. For example, full-bladder follicular scanning and laparoscopic oocyte retrievals were converted to TVUS-guided procedures. The application of higher-frequency scanning probes provided greater resolution and improved the clinician's ability to evaluate the ovary for pathologic conditions, for determination of ovarian reserve, and for therapeutic decisions during ovarian stimulation cycles. All these uses of TVUS of the ovary will be discussed in this article."
CD011126,0,25528732,0,The evolving role of saline infusion sonography (SIS) in infertility.,"Saline infusion sonography (SIS) has become a valuable diagnostic modality in gynaecology over the last three decades. SIS is now commonly employed for detailed evaluation of the uterine cavity as part of pre-treatment assessment in infertile women. The objective of this paper is review the scientific literature on SIS in infertility. Medline, Ovid and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles. The indications, technical aspects and the potential advantages of SIS are discussed. The efficacy and sensitivity of SIS are compared to hysteroscopy in the evaluation of uterine polyps, fibroids, intrauterine adhesions and uterine anomalies. Increasing evidence suggests the use of SIS prior to an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle as it has increased sensitivity in the detection of intrauterine pathology. SIS is cost-effective and results in better patient satisfaction scores than hysteroscopy."

On those identified as malignant (30 %), treatment is more complex, consisting in radical orchiectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. This work tries to describe our case series of paratesticular tumors over the last 25 years and to make a comparative analysis with the information published in the world literature."
CD011126,0,15125004,0,Computerized detection of colorectal masses in CT colonography based on fuzzy merging and wall-thickening analysis.,"In recent years, several computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes have been developed for the detection of polyps in CT colonography (CTC). However, few studies have addressed the problem of computerized detection of colorectal masses in CTC. This is mostly because masses are considered to be well visualized by a radiologist because of their size and invasiveness. Nevertheless, the automated detection of masses would naturally complement the automated detection of polyps in CTC and would produce a more comprehensive computer aid to radiologists. Therefore, in this study, we identified some of the problems involved with the computerized detection of masses, and we developed a scheme for the computerized detection of masses that can be integrated into a CAD scheme for the detection of polyps. The performance of the mass detection scheme was evaluated by application to clinical CTC data sets. CTC was performed on 82 patients with helical CT scanners and reconstruction intervals of 1.0-5.0 mm in the supine and prone positions. Fourteen patients (17%) had a total of 14 masses of 30-50 mm, and sixteen patients (20%) had a total of 30 polyps 5-25 mm in diameter. Four patients had both polyps and masses. Fifty-six of the patients (68%) were normal. The CTC data were interpolated linearly to yield isotropic data sets, and the colon was extracted by use of a knowledge-guided segmentation technique. Two methods, fuzzy merging and wall-thickening analysis, were developed for the detection of masses. The fuzzy merging method detected masses with a significant intraluminal component by separating the initial CAD detections of locally cap-like shapes within the colonic wall into mass candidates and polyp candidates. The wall-thickening analysis detected nonintraluminal masses by searching the colonic wall for abnormal thickening. The final regions of the mass candidates were extracted by use of a level set method based on a fast marching algorithm. False-positive (FP) detections were reduced by a quadratic discriminant classifier. The performance of the scheme was evaluated by use of a leave-one-out (round-robin) method with by-patient elimination. All but one of the 14 masses, which was partially cut off from the CTC data set in both supine and prone positions, were detected. The fuzzy merging method detected 11 of the masses, and the wall-thickening analysis detected 3 of the masses including all nonintraluminal masses. In combination, the two methods detected 13 of the 14 masses with 0.21 FPs per patient on average based on the leave-one-out evaluation. Most FPs were generated by extrinsic compression of the colonic wall that would be recognized easily and quickly by a radiologist. The mass detection methods did not affect the result of the polyp detection. The results indicate that the scheme is potentially useful in providing a high-performance CAD scheme for the detection of colorectal neoplasms in CTC."
CD011126,0,21974977,0,Ovarian morphology in premenstrual dysphoria.,"Ovarian cyclicity is a prerequisite for premenstrual dysphoria (PMD), as illustrated by the fact that this condition is effectively eliminated by ovariectomy or by treatment with a GnRH agonist. Despite the possibility of differences in ovarian function between women with and without PMD, no study comparing ovarian morphology in these two groups has ever been published. Fifty-two women were recruited for this study; 26 had premenstrual dysphoria, fulfilling criteria slightly modified from those of the premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and 26 were asymptomatic age-matched controls. Ovarian morphology was assessed using transvaginal 7 MHz ultrasonography on day 5 after the start of menses, and venous blood was sampled for hormone analysis on days 3 and 8, the expected day of ovulation, and day -4 of the menstrual cycle. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to the prevalence of polycystic ovaries (PCO), the total number of follicles, the total ovarian volume or serum levels of androgen hormones. In addition, serum free testosterone levels in late premenstrual phase showed an inverse association to premenstrual symptoms of irritability and a similar inverse association trend to symptoms of depressed mood. Unexpectedly, the prevalence of ovaries with fewer than five antral or growing follicles was significantly higher in women with PMD than in controls (p=0.016). While the results do not support a role for PCO or androgen hormones in eliciting late luteal phase irritability, the possible relationship between oligofollicular ovaries and PMD deserves further study."

CD011126,0,19777299,0,Ultrasound-guided radiofrequency thermal ablation of uterine fibroids: medium-term follow-up.,"Previous studies have shown that radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) of uterine fibroids through a percutaneous ultrasound (US)-guided procedure is an effective and safe minimally invasive treatment, with encouraging short-term results. The aim of this study was to assess the results in terms of volume reduction and clinical symptoms improvement in the midterm follow-up of fibroids with a diameter of up to 8 cm. Eleven premenopausal females affected by symptomatic fibroids underwent percutaneous US-guided RFA. Symptom severity and reduction in volume were evaluated at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The mean symptom score (SSS) before the procedure was 50.30 (range 31.8-67.30), and the average quality of life (QOL) score value was 62 (range 37.20-86.00). The mean basal diameter was 5.5 cm (range 4.4-8) and the mean volume was 101.5 cm(3) (range 44.58-278 cm(3)). The mean follow-up was 9 months (range 3-12 months). The mean SSS value at the end of the follow-up was 13.38 (range 0-67.1) and the QOL 90.4 (range 43.8-100). At follow-up the mean diameter was 3.0 cm (range 1.20-4.5 cm), and the mean volume was 18 cm(3) (range 0.90-47.6 cm(3)). In 10 of 11 patients we obtained total or partial regression of symptoms. In one case the clinical manifestations persisted and it was thus considered unsuccessful. In conclusion, US-guided percutaneous RFA is a safe and effective treatment even for fibroids up to 8 cm."
CD011126,0,21145186,0,Diagnostic evaluation of the endometrium in postmenopausal bleeding: an evidence-based approach.,"Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) is a common complaint in general gynecological practice. Women with PMB have around a 10% chance of having endometrial carcinoma and therefore PMB always needs further evaluation. This article summarizes the reviews on the subject and provides an overview of the use of diagnostic tools in patients with PMB. Four types of diagnostic test are described: sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness, endometrial sampling, hysteroscopy and saline infusion sonography. All four have been independently shown to be accurate in excluding endometrial cancer. However, neither in systematic reviews nor in international guidelines is consensus found regarding the sequence in which these methods should be employed in women with PMB. For measurement of endometrial thickness in symptomatic women, a cut-off value of 3mm is recommended, but the cost-effectiveness of this strategy has yet to be shown. Research should now focus on the incorporation of individual patient characteristics and pre-test probabilities for cancer in algorithms for the investigation of PMB, and the most cost-effective sequenced combination of the four types of test."

CD011126,0,14602766,0,Reduced ovarian function in long-term survivors of radiation- and chemotherapy-treated childhood cancer.,"Seventy percent of children with cancer survive. Radiation and chemotherapy may, however, impair ovarian function. The aim of this population-based study was to achieve a comprehensive knowledge of the degree of ovarian damage. Ovarian function was evaluated in 100 childhood cancer survivors and 21 controls of similar age. Menstrual cycle pattern was recorded, and strictly timed ovarian sonography and hormonal assessment were performed. The median age of the survivors was 5.4 yr (range, 0.1-15.3) at the time of diagnosis and 25.7 yr (18.5-44.4) at study entry. Seventeen survivors with premature ovarian failure had follicle-depleted or nondetectable ovaries, elevated FSH and LH, and immeasurable inhibin B. Thirteen survivors used oral contraception. Survivors with spontaneous menstrual cycles (n = 70) had smaller ovarian volume per ovary than controls (median, 4.8 vs. 6.8 cm(3); P < 0.001) and a lower number of antral follicles per ovary (median, 7.5 vs. 11; P < 0.001). Further, they had lower inhibin B levels than controls (median, 94 vs. 111 pg/ml; P = 0.03) and higher estradiol levels (median, 0.12 vs. 0.08 pM; P = 0.04). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to predict the total antral follicle number per ovary, and it showed a reduced number with ovarian irradiation (beta = -0.40, P < 0.001), alkylating chemotherapy (beta = -0.25, P = 0.01), older age at diagnosis (beta = -0.25, P = 0.01), and longer time period off treatment (beta = -0.19, P = 0.044). One in every six female survivors may develop premature ovarian failure. In survivors with spontaneous menstrual cycles, the results indicate a diminished ovarian reserve. Consequently, cessation of fertility may occur much earlier than anticipated. Adult survivors with spontaneous cycles should be informed hereof to plan childbearing."

The definition of the syndrome has been much debated. Key features include menstrual cycle disturbance, hyperandrogenism and obesity. There are many extra-ovarian aspects to the pathophysiology of PCOS, yet ovarian dysfunction is central. At a recent joint ASRM/ESHRE consensus meeting, a refined definition of the PCOS was agreed, encompassing a description of the morphology of the polycystic ovary (PCO). According to the available literature, the criteria fulfilling sufficient specificity and sensitivity to define the PCO should have at least one of the following: either 12 or more follicles measuring 2-9 mm in diameter, or increased ovarian volume (> 10 cm3). If there is a follicle > 10 mm in diameter, the scan should be repeated at a time of ovarian quiescence in order to calculate volume and area. The presence of a single PCO is sufficient to provide the diagnosis. The distribution of follicles and a description of the stroma are not required in the diagnosis. Increased stromal echogenicity and/or stromal volume are specific to PCO, but it has been shown that the measurement of ovarian volume (or area) is a good surrogate for quantification of the stroma in clinical practice. A woman having PCO in the absence of an ovulation disorder or hyperandrogenism ('asymptomatic PCO') should not be considered as having PCOS, until more is known about this situation. Three-dimensional and Doppler ultrasound studies may be useful research tools but are not required in the definition of PCO. This review outlines evidence for the current ultrasound definition of the polycystic ovary and technical specifications."

The accuracy of MVCT imaging techniques, and dosimetric accuracy of the CT based plans were tested with in-house and commercially-available phantoms. Three dimensional (3D) dose distributions were computed and compared to the two dimensional (2D) dosimetry results. Minimal doses received by the 2 cm3 of bladder and rectum receiving the highest doses (D(B2cc) and D(R2cc), respectively) were computed from dose-volume histograms and compared to the doses computed for the standard ICRU bladder and rectal reference dose points. Phantom test objects in MVCT image sets were localized with sub-millimetric accuracy, and the accuracy of the MVCT-based dose calculation was verified. Fifteen brachytherapy insertions were also analyzed. The ICRU rectal point dose did not differ significantly from D(R2cc) (p=0.749, mean difference was 24 cGy +/- 283 cGy). The ICRU bladder point dose was significantly lower than the D(B2cc) (p=0.024, mean difference was 291 cGy +/- 444 cGy). The median volumes of bladder and rectum receiving at least the corresponding ICRU reference point dose were 6.1 cm(3) and 2.0 cm(3), respectively. Our initial experience in using MVCT imaging for clinical LDR gynecological brachytherapy indicates that the MVCT images are of sufficient quality for use in 3D, MVCT-based dose planning."

An appropriate therapy may require multiple genes to enhance therapeutic outcome by modulating inflammatory response and angiogenesis in a controlled and time-dependent manner. Thus, the aim of this research was to assess the spatiotemporal efficacy of a dual-gene therapy model based on 3D collagen scaffolds loaded with the therapeutic genes interleukin 10 (IL-10), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), a promoter of angiogenesis. A collagen-based scaffold loaded with plasmid IL-10 polyplexes and plasmid eNOS polyplexes encapsulated into microspheres was used to transfect HUVECs and HMSCs cells.The therapeutic efficacy of the system was monitored at 2, 7 and 14 days for eNOS and IL-10 mRNA expression using RT-PCR and live cell imaging molecular beacon technology. The dual gene releasing collagen-based scaffold provided both sustained and delayed release of functional polyplexes in vitro over a 14 day period which was corroborated with variation in expression levels seen using RT-PCR and MB imaging. Maximum fold increases in IL-10 mRNA and eNOS mRNA expression levels occurred at day 7 in HMSCs and HUVECs. However, IL-10 mRNA expression levels seemed dependent on frequency of media changes and/or ease of transfection of the cell type. It was demonstrated that molecular beacons are able to monitor changes in mRNA levels at various time points, in the presence of a 3D scaffolding gene carrier system and the results complemented those of RT-PCR."

In addition, the rising prevalence of obesity in the paediatric population may compound insulin resistance in girls predisposed to ovarian hyperandrogenism leading to younger age of presentation and more severe phenotype. It is important to distinguish between normal puberty and true ovarian hyperandrogenism, as well as excluding other causes of androgen excess such as adrenal tumours or non classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The long term co-morbidities associated with ovarian hyperandrogenism presenting during adolescence are not well defined but there is likely to be increased cardiovascular risk. There are little data on intervention in the adolescent population and studies in adult women often focus on ovulation and fertility which are less of a concern to adolescents. Current options include insulin sensitisation with metformin, anti androgens, or the oral contraceptive pill, with each girl being treated on an individual basis. There is a requirement for establishment of normative data in adolescence, in conjunction with physiological phenotyping in order to elucidate potential mechanisms thus informing potential intervention."

Additional imaging modalities could be useful for further characterization of adnexal masses in this group of women. A prospective cohort study was conducted of 196 women with an adnexal mass referred to a teaching hospital for diagnosis and management. Follow-up data was obtained for 180 women; 119 women had benign and 61 women malignant adnexal masses. The sensitivity and specificity of specialist US, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radioimmunoscintigraphy (RS), and the RMI were determined. We identified a subgroup of women with RMI values of 25-1000 where the value of further specialist imaging was evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity for specialist US were 100% and 57%, for MRI 92% and 86%, and for RS 76% and 87%, respectively. Analysis of 123 patients managed sequentially, using RMI cutoff values of > or =25 and <1000 and then US and MRI provided a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 90%. Using this RMI cutoff followed by specialist US and MRI, as opposed to the traditional RMI cutoff value of 250, can increase the proportion of patients with cancer appropriately referred in to a cancer center, with no change in the proportion of patients with benign disease being managed in a local unit."

Nabothian cysts are a common gynecologic condition; if multiple and/or large cysts are present, it is difficult to differentiate them from a minimal-deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), which is classified as a special type of cervical adenocarcinoma. We report three cases of deep nabothian cysts and three cases of MDAs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, signs, and symptoms of these cases are described. The absence of a watery discharge and an MR image displaying a round or oval cyst without enhancement after intravenous gadolinium are helpful in the diagnosis of a deep nabothian cyst."

CD011126,0,20674783,0,Complications of hysteroscopic and uterine resectoscopic surgery.,"Adverse events associated with hysteroscopic procedures are in general rare, but, with increasing operative complexity, it is now apparent that they are experienced more often. A spectrum of complications exist ranging from those that relate to generic components of procedures such as patient positioning and anesthesia and analgesia, to a number that are specific to intraluminal endoscopic surgery (perforation and injuries to surrounding structures and blood vessels). The response of premenopausal women to excessive absorption of nonionic fluids deserves special attention. There is also an increasing awareness of uncommon but problematic sequelae related to the use of monopolar uterine resectoscopes that involve thermal injury to the vulva and vagina. The uterus that has previously undergone hysteroscopic surgery can behave in unusual ways, at least in premenopausal women who experience menstruation or who become pregnant. Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in these adverse events, as well as the use or development of several devices, have collectively provided the opportunity to perform hysteroscopic and resectoscopic surgery in a manner that minimizes risk to the patient."

The clinical use of color Doppler sonography has been demonstrated within many organ systems. Color Doppler sonography has become an integral part of cardiovascular imaging. Significant improvements have recently occurred, improving the visualization and evaluation of intra-organ vascularity, resulting from enhancements in delineation of tissue detail through electronic compounding and harmonics, as well as enhancements in signal processing of frequency- and/or amplitude-based color Doppler sonography. Spatial representation of vascularity can be improved by utilizing 3D and 4D (live 3D) processing. Greater sensitivity of color Doppler sonography to macro- and microvascular flow has provided improved anatomic and physiologic assessment throughout pregnancy and for pelvic organs. The potential use of contrast enhancement is also mentioned as a means to further differentiate benign from malignant ovarian lesions. The rapid development of these new sonographic techniques will continue to enlarge the scope of clinical applications in a variety of obstetric and gynecologic disorders."

CD011126,0,18487965,0,Diagnostic imaging in gynecologic malignancy.,"Advances in imaging techniques over the past few decades have continued at an astounding pace and now physicians have various modalities to examine the human body. These imaging techniques may be used to assist in diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of oncology patients. The increasing complexity of diagnostic radiology provides a challenge to radiologists and oncologists to use these tools in a clinically efficient and cost-effective manner. The ultimate goal is to offer a safe and effective examination that provides clinically relevant information for the management of an individual patient. Currently ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are being used to evaluate patients with gynecological malignancies. Goal of this review is to provide an overview of clinically available imaging techniques and discuss relative strengths and weaknesses. This article summarizes the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios) of US, CT, MRI and PET/CT in the diagnosis of various gynecological diseases and tumors. US is the first-line imaging modality of choice and is used to discriminate between benign and malignant adnexal masses and for characterizing adnexal tumors such as dermoid cyst, endometrioma, hemorrhagic corpus luteum, etc., for diagnosing intrauterine pathology in women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and for confirming or refuting pelvic pathology in women with pelvic pain. MRI can play a role in detecting the extent of disease and helps in local staging of gynecologic tumors. CT can be used to detect extrapelvic disease and PET/CT can assist in detecting distant metastatic disease in order to select appropriate surgical candidates."

It also details the uncertainties associated with such a process. Eight Nucletron interstitial ring applicators-Ø26 mm (×4), Ø30 mm (×3) and Ø34 mm (×1), and one 60 mm intrauterine tube were used in this study. RTQA2 and XRQA2 gafchromic films were irradiated at pre-programmed dwell positions with three successive (192)Ir sources and used to derive the coordinates of the source dwell positions. The source was observed to deviate significantly from its expected position by up to 6.1 mm in all ring sizes. Significant inter applicator differences of up to 2.6 mm were observed between a subset of ring applicators. Also, the measured data were observed to differ significantly from commercially available source path models provided by Nucletron with differences of up to 3.7 mm across all ring applicator sizes. The total expanded uncertainty (k = 2) averaged over all measured dwell positions in the rings was observed to be 1.1 ± 0.1 mm (Ø26 mm and Ø30 mm rings) and 1.0 ± 0.3 mm (Ø34 mm ring) respectively, and when transferred to the treatment planning system, equated to maximum %dose changes of 1.9%, 13.2% and 1.5% at regions representative of the parametrium, lateral fornix and organs at risk respectively."

CD011126,0,24802230,0,Impact of treatment response metrics on photodynamic therapy planning and outcomes in a three-dimensional model of ovarian cancer.,"Common methods to characterize treatment efficacy based on morphological imaging may misrepresent outcomes and exclude effective therapies. Using a three-dimensional model of ovarian cancer, two functional treatment response metrics are used to evaluate photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy: total volume, calculated from viable and nonviable cells, and live volume, calculated from viable cells. The utility of these volume-based metrics is corroborated using independent reporters of photodynamic activity: viability, a common fluorescence-based ratiometric analysis, and photosensitizer photobleaching, which is characterized by a loss of fluorescence due in part to the production of reactive species during PDT. Live volume correlated with both photobleaching and viability, suggesting that it was a better reporter of PDT efficacy than total volume, which did not correlate with either metric. Based on these findings, live volume and viability are used to probe the susceptibilities of tumor populations to a range of PDT dose parameters administered using 0.25, 1, and 10 μM benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD). PDT with 0.25 μM BPD produces the most significant reduction in live volume and viability and mediates a substantial shift toward small nodules. Increasingly sophisticated bioengineered models may complement current treatment planning approaches and provide unique opportunities to critically evaluate key parameters including metrics of therapeutic response."

CD011126,0,8821885,0,Comparative study of transvaginal ultrasonography and hysteroscopy in postmenopausal bleeding.,"Twenty-eight women with postmenopausal bleeding were retrospectively studied to assess the accuracy of transvaginal sonography (TVS) and hysteroscopy for diagnosing endometrial pathology. TVS was performed in all patients. Considering a cutoff value of < or = 5 mm as normal, TVS showed normal findings in 14 patients (50%) and suggested endometrial abnormalities in other 14 (50%). Hysteroscopy could be performed in 24 patients (85.7%). In 17 (70.2%) cases no abnormality was found; an endometrial polyp was suspected in 6 (25%) and endometrial hyperplasia in 1 (4.8%) patient. All patients underwent endometrial biopsy or dilatation and curettage for histopathologic study. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for TVS and hysteroscopy were 100, 60.8, 35.7, and 100% and 100, 89.4, 71.4, and 100%, respectively. In our experience, both methods were highly sensitive, but hysteroscopy was more specific than TVS."
CD011126,0,24455971,0,Relationship between human chorionic gonadotropin serum levels and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.,"The object of this retrospective cohort study was to determine if hCG levels correlate with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) risk after adjustment for other risk factors during in vitro fertilization (IVF). We measured serum hCG approximately 12 h after hCG trigger in women undergoing 406 cycles of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF between June 2006 and December 2009. Serum hCG levels were measured 12 h after trigger. Bivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between patient and cycle characteristics and OHSS. In our series, mild to moderate OHSS occurred in 9% (38/406), and severe OHSS diagnosed in 1.5% (6/406) of IVF cycles. OHSS risk was increased in younger women (<30 years old: adjusted odds ratio: aOR 2.46, 95% confidence interval: CI 1.14-5.34), increased number of oocytes (11-20: aOR 6.79, 95% CI 1.97-23.40; >20: aOR 17.55, 95% CI 4.84-63.70), and increase E2 levels (≥3,000 pg/mL: aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.33-5.05), but was unrelated to hCG level (100-200 IU/L: aOR 1.53, 95% CI 0.60-3.91; ≥200 IU/L: aOR 1.42 95% CI 0.48-4.20). These results indicate that OHSS risk during IVF is unrelated to serum hCG level measured approximately 12 h after trigger."

However, clomiphene citrate is still widely prescribed by gynaecologists and general practitioners who do not have access to ultrasound monitoring. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of multifollicular development with different doses of clomiphene citrate. A retrospective review of transvaginal ultrasound monitoring of 425 cycles in 182 women receiving clomiphene citrate from January 2002 to December 2003, was studied. Three or more follicles of >or= 14 mm were identified in 58 cycles (14%). Patients received 50 mg of clomiphene citrate in 52 of these 58 cycles and 25 mg in the remaining six. One patient was noted to have developed five follicles and 10 patients developed four follicles. One patient developed six follicles, despite receiving only 25 mg clomiphene citrate daily. It was concluded that a significant number of women (14%) developed three or more follicles, despite receiving low doses of clomiphene citrate."
CD011126,0,21775460,0,An externalized polypeptide partitions between two distinct sites on genome-released poliovirus particles.,"During cell entry, native poliovirus (160S) converts to a cell-entry intermediate (135S) particle, resulting in the externalization of capsid proteins VP4 and the amino terminus of VP1 (residues 1 to 53). Externalization of these entities is followed by release of the RNA genome (uncoating), leaving an empty (80S) particle. The antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of a monospecific peptide 1 (P1) antibody, which was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino-terminal residues 24 to 40 of VP1, was utilized to track the location of the amino terminus of VP1 in the 135S and 80S states of poliovirus particles via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and three-dimensional image reconstruction. On 135S, P1 Fabs bind to a prominent feature on the external surface known as the ""propeller tip."" In contrast, our initial 80S-P1 reconstruction showed P1 Fabs also binding to a second site, at least 50 Å distant, at the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Further analysis showed that the overall population of 80S-P1 particles consisted of three kinds of capsids: those with P1 Fabs bound only at the propeller tips, P1 Fabs bound only at the 2-fold axes, or P1 Fabs simultaneously bound at both positions. Our results indicate that, in 80S particles, a significant fraction of VP1 can deviate from icosahedral symmetry. Hence, this portion of VP1 does not change conformation synchronously when switching from the 135S state. These conclusions are compatible with previous observations of multiple conformations of the 80S state and suggest that movement of the amino terminus of VP1 has a role in uncoating. Similar deviations from icosahedral symmetry may be biologically significant during other viral transitions."
CD011126,0,8840177,0,Transvaginal ultrasound in the diagnosis of diffuse adenomyosis.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic capability of transvaginal ultrasound in detecting diffuse adenomyosis. One hundred and seventy-five women, mean age 45.8 years (range 37-62), were studied by TV ultrasound before hysterectomy for benign uterine pathology. The sonographer diagnosed adenomyosis in 19 patients, whereas the pathologist diagnosed adenomyosis in 15 women making ex novo diagnoses in 2 cases. The sensitivity of TV ultrasound was 86.6%, the specificity 96.2%, the positive predictive value 68.4%, and the negative predictive value 98%. In conclusion, this study showed that TV ultrasound is an important and advanced tool in the diagnosis of diffuse adenomyosis."
CD011126,0,8840176,0,The relationship between ultrasonic volume and actual weight of pathologic uterus.,"Our purpose was to assess the correlation between the estimated volume based on ultrasonic measurement in vivo and the actual weight of the diseased uterus after hysterectomy, and then retrospectively tried to establish a simple equation to convert the volume into the weight in grams. A total of 105 women with nonmalignant diseased uteri which were prepared to undergo laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy had had preoperative ultrasound scanning to estimate the uterine size by measuring three dimensions including the length (L), width (W) and anteroposterior (AP) diameter. The uterine volume was calculated by the use of a prolate ellipsoid formula (4/3 x pi x L/2 x W/2 x AP/2). Actual uterine weight was immediately taken after extirpation of the uterus. Linear regression analysis revealed uterine weight (g) = 50.0 + 0.71 x volume (cm3), with correlation coefficient = 0.93 and SE = 49.6 g. There was a close, positive correlation between the estimated uterine volume and actual uterine weight. With utilization of this equation, the uterine size in vivo can thus be expressed as a concrete, objective value in weight instead of ""weeks' size' by comparison with pregnant uterus, which has been commonly used in traditional gynecologic practice."
CD011126,0,8840175,0,Abnormal uterine bleeding with normal uterine fluid level of human decidua-associated protein 200 reflects normal endometrial histology.,"In the current study, the uterine fluid level of human decidua-associated protein (hDP) 200 was measured in 80 women with abnormal uterine bleeding and normal histology. In 20 women the level of hDP200 was also correlated with the endometrial thickness measured by transvaginal ultrasonography. The results demonstrated the same distribution and similar levels of uterine fluid hDP200 throughout the menstrual cycle as in regularly cycling women, with no correlation between the levels of hDP200 and the endometrial thickness. Thus, the test for uterine fluid hDP200 could serve to discriminate between benign and pathological examinations of endometrial biopsies in women of reproductive age, women with abnormal uterine bleeding and benign conditions of the endometrium. Very low levels of hDP200 are indicative of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma."

CD011126,0,23963401,0,Tissue engineering of a human 3D in vitro tumor test system.,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies are predominantly developed in 2D culture systems, which inadequately reflect physiological conditions in vivo. Biological 3D matrices provide cells an environment in which cells can self-organize, allowing the study of tissue organization and cell differentiation. Such scaffolds can be seeded with a mixture of different cell types to study direct 3D cell-cell-interactions. To mimic the 3D complexity of cancer tumors, our group has developed a 3D in vitro tumor test system. Our 3D tissue test system models the in vivo situation of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which we established with our decellularized porcine jejunal segment derived biological vascularized scaffold (BioVaSc). In our model, we reseeded a modified BioVaSc matrix with primary fibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells (mvECs) and the S462 tumor cell line. For static culture, the vascular structure of the BioVaSc is removed and the remaining scaffold is cut open on one side (Small Intestinal Submucosa SIS-Muc). The resulting matrix is then fixed between two metal rings (cell crowns). Another option is to culture the cell-seeded SIS-Muc in a flow bioreactor system that exposes the cells to shear stress. Here, the bioreactor is connected to a peristaltic pump in a self-constructed incubator. A computer regulates the arterial oxygen and nutrient supply via parameters such as blood pressure, temperature, and flow rate. This setup allows for a dynamic culture with either pressure-regulated pulsatile or constant flow. In this study, we could successfully establish both a static and dynamic 3D culture system for MPNSTs. The ability to model cancer tumors in a more natural 3D environment will enable the discovery, testing, and validation of future pharmaceuticals in a human-like model."

This retrospective descriptive study was conducted in a private assisted reproductive technology unit. Medical records of ICSI cycles performed between January 2003 and December 2004 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups: patients with endometrial polyps discovered during ovarian stimulation (group 1, n=15), patients who underwent hysteroscopic polyp resection prior to their ICSI cycle (group 2, n=40) and patients without polyps (group 3, n=956). Main outcome measures were clinical pregnancy rates and implantation rates. Age of the patients, age of the husbands, body mass index, total amount of gonadotrophins used, length of stimulation, peak oestradiol concentrations, peak endometrial thickness and number of embryos replaced were not significantly different between the groups, nor were the pregnancy and implantation rates. Only one patient (12.5%) from the first group experienced miscarriage within 12 weeks of pregnancy. In conclusion, endometrial polyps discovered during ovarian stimulation do not negatively affect pregnancy and implantation outcomes in ICSI cycles."

CD011126,0,21917606,0,Potential role of HE4 in multimodal screening for epithelial ovarian cancer.,"In screening for epithelial ovarian cancer, unnecessary surgery can be reduced by limiting use of transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) to women with increasing CA125 serum levels. Replacing or augmenting TVU with measurement of a serum marker specific for malignancy might further improve screening performance. Serum samples from 112 invasive ovarian cancer patients and 706 matched control subjects from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian trial were used to evaluate human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), mesothelin, matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), SLPI, Spondin2, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) for their potential use in screening. TVU results were available for a subset of 84 patients and 516 control subjects used to compare the best marker with TVU. HE4 was found to perform better than TVU as a second-line screen, confirming 27 of 39 cancers with increasing CA125 serum levels compared with 17 cancers confirmed by TVU (P = .03). Serum HE4 levels were found to increase with age and smoking status, suggesting that a longitudinal algorithm might improve its performance."

The anatomical defect of endometrium by uterine fibroids could be a factor for reducing pregnancy rates and increasing miscarriage rates. However, pregnancy and implantation rates were found to be significantly lower in women with intramural myomas (IMMs), when there was no deformity of uterine cavity. This could be due to other biological factors such as increased accumulation of inflammatory cells within fibroid tissue and corresponding endometrium that might impair fertility. Therefore, we tried to investigate the pattern of macrophage (Mvarphi) accumulation in different uterine fibroids and the production of chemokine and prostaglandin (PG) by these tissues."

CD011126,0,15653583,0,Pelvic pain: overlooked and underdiagnosed gynecologic conditions.,"Chronic pelvic pain is a common, disabling problem among women. Although chronic pelvic pain can be produced by many conditions, some gynecologic causes are frequently overlooked and underdiagnosed, resulting in inappropriate referral and inadequate treatment. The gynecologic conditions most often unrecognized are endometriosis, adenomyosis, pelvic congestion, and less common congenital and acquired abnormalities. Transvaginal ultrasonography (US) is helpful for assessing endometriotic cysts but has a limited role in the diagnosis of adhesions or peritoneal implants. The classic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features diagnostic of endometrioma are a cystic mass with high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and loss of signal intensity on T2-weighted images. When transvaginal US findings are suggestive of adenomyosis, MR imaging is used as the definitive imaging modality for diagnosis. High-resolution transvaginal US and MR imaging can help establish the diagnosis of adenomyosis with a high degree of accuracy, since the imaging appearance closely correlates with the histopathologic characteristics. Pelvic varices can be identified by using transvaginal US with color Doppler and Doppler spectral analysis. Three-dimensional T1 gradient-echo sequences performed after the intravenous administration of gadolinium are the most effective MR imaging sequence for demonstrating pelvic varices. Blood flow in pelvic varices appears with high signal intensity. Recent advances in radiologic imaging and therapeutic procedures make it possible to diagnose accurately the conditions producing chronic pelvic pain in most women and to guide effective treatment."

We performed a prospective study in 75 Jamaican Afro-Caribbean women with postmenopausal bleeding to determine whether an endometrial thickness of < 5 mm excluded endometrial cancer. We also examined the aetiology of postmenopausal bleeding and looked for possible risk factors. Double-layer transvaginal ultrasonographic measurement of the endometrial thickness was followed by hysteroscopy, suction curettage and histopathological confirmation. Correlation between imaging and pathology was not reliable. Half the patients with endometrial cancer had an endometrial thickness of between 3 mm and 4 mm. Seventy per cent of the women with endometrial thickness of greater than 5 mm had benign pathology. Additionally, the following characteristics were found to be more strongly associated with women with endometrial cancer: age over 65 years and 5 or more years since menopause.

Based on our own experiences and on review of the literature, 3DUS can be successfully used in infants and children for brain, spine, cardiac, urinary tract (particularly assessment of hydronephrosis, and virtual cystoscopy), and female genital (e.g., for assessment of uterine malformations) US, and for various other applications, particularly in small parts. Power Doppler data can be integrated, allowing 3DUS-angiography. Thus, 3DUS promises to become a useful adjunct for imaging children, particularly as it enhances ultrasound by offering additional, previously inaccessible planes, rendering options and surface assessments. 3DUS should be increasingly exploited, thus hopefully helping reduce the need for more invasive or burdening (e.g., ionizing radiation) investigations in children."

CD011126,0,22925074,0,Evaluation of the efficacy of flaxseed meal and flaxseed extract in reducing menopausal symptoms.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of flaxseed meal and flaxseed extract in reducing climacteric symptoms of menopausal women. Ninety menopausal women were randomly distributed into three study groups: group I received 1 g per day of flaxseed extract containing at least 100 mg of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), group II received 90 g per day of flaxseed meal containing at least 270 mg of SDG, and group III received 1 g per day of collagen (placebo group). Subjects were assessed for menopausal symptoms by the Kupperman index at the beginning and at the end of the 6 months of treatment. Subjects were also assessed for endometrial thickness and vaginal cytology. The Kupperman index values at the beginning and end of the treatments were analyzed using the paired t-test. Both the flaxseed extract (P=.007) and the flaxseed meal (P=.005) were effective in reducing the menopausal symptoms when compared with the placebo control (P=.082). Alternatively, the changes in Kupperman index were also computed and submitted to analysis of variance. In this case, no significant differences were found (P=.084) although the data indicate a decreasing tendency for the Kupperman index by both the flaxseed extract and the flaxseed meal groups. Neither the flaxseed extract nor the flaxseed meal exerted clinically important estrogenic effects on the vaginal epithelium or endometrium as revealed by the absence of changes in the blood levels of follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol, as well as in the endometrial thickness, and vaginal epithelial maturation value. No serious adverse events related to the treatments were reported. Although the results of the present study do not allow an unequivocal conclusion about the action of flaxseed on the menopausal symptoms, they suggest that it could be premature to conclude that no such action exists. Clearly the matter still deserves further experimental attention."

It is associated with a myriad of problems and complications, one of which is the missing IUCD. It is a known fact that IUCDs can perforate the uterus resulting in its subsequent relocation in other organs within the pelvis and the abdomen. This study showed that more than 50% of clinically diagnosed cases of a missing IUCD are still located within the endometrial cavity. It is therefore being proposed that a clinical diagnosis of 'missing string' be made until adequate radiological investigations, such as ultrasonography, plain X-rays and computerized tomography, have been carried out."

We herein report a 16-year-old adolescent girl that presented with a giant ovarian cyst. To reduce the limitations of the laparoscopy, we performed laparoscopy after draining the cyst under ultrasonographic guidance. Under local anesthesia, a nephrostomy catheter was placed into the cyst by the Seldinger technique. During laparoscopy, abdominal cavity was explored by the scope and then the nephrostomy catheter was removed. Laparoscopic procedure was completed easily. No pre- and postoperative complications were encountered and the patient was discharged on the second postoperative day. The pathologic examination of the cyst revealed as follicular cyst. Laparoscopic excision of giant ovarian cysts after ultrasound-guided drainage seems to be safe and applicable treatment modality in children."

Virtual hysterosalpingography is an emerging modality in which aspects of the established technique of hysterosalpingography are combined with the cutting-edge technology of multidetector computed tomography (CT) to allow a comprehensive and highly accurate evaluation of both the female reproductive system and the pelvic anatomy generally. Unlike ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, multidetector CT is capable of depicting both the external and internal surfaces of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and other pelvic organs, providing high-resolution data that are suitable for two- and three-dimensional reconstructions and virtual endoscopic views. Thus, virtual hysterosalpingography may prove to be superior to other noninvasive modalities for evaluating tubal patency. Moreover, in comparison with conventional hysterosalpingography, which may involve cervical clamping, virtual hysterosalpingography is painless. Because of the health risks associated with ionizing radiation, the use of another modality (eg, MR imaging, US) may be preferred if the presence of a focal uterine lesion is strongly suspected. However, virtual hysterosalpingography with multidetector CT may provide a diagnostic advantage in complex cases."

Sixty infertile patients with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic neuropathy were selected. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to duration of diabetes (group A ≤ 5 years, group B between 5 and 15 years, and group C ≥ 15 years). A pathological control group of 20 infertile patients without diabetes and a real control group of 20 healthy fertile men were selected and compared. Patients underwent prostate-vesicular transrectal ultrasonography and sperm analysis. The following ultrasound parameters were recorded: 1) body anteroposterior diameter (APD); 2) fundus APD; 3) parietal thickness of the right and left SVs; 4) number of polycyclic areas within both SVs; 5) fundus-to-body ratio; 6) difference of the parietal thickness between the right and the left SVs; and 7) pre-ejaculatory and postejaculatory APD difference. All patients with diabetes had a significantly (P < .05) higher fundus-to-body ratio compared with controls. Group C had a significantly (P < .05) higher fundus-to-body ratio compared with other diabetes groups. There was no significant difference (P > .05) relative to the number of polycyclic areas in patients with diabetes and controls. All patients with diabetes had a significantly lower (P < .05) preejaculatory and postejaculatory difference in body SV APD compared with controls. Group A and group B had a similar preejaculatory and postejaculatory difference in body SV APD, whereas this difference was significantly (P < .05) lower in group C. In conclusion, infertile patients with diabetes and neuropathy have peculiar SV ultrasound features suggestive of functional atony, and duration of disease is associated with worse changes in ultrasound findings."

Twenty-three patients with esophageal neoplasms underwent MDCT with esophageal distension and endoscopy. Of them, 20 underwent barium study. Two radiologists independently reviewed MDCT images with 3D CT esophagography (CTE) including CT endoscopy and were asked to determine the presence of the esophageal lesions and characterize them using a five-point confidence scale. The radiologists' performance for the lesion detection and characterization was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. They were also requested to determine the local staging of esophageal cancer, and the overall accuracies of MDCT for local staging were calculated. The ability of MDCT with CTE was also evaluated compared with conventional studies. CTE images successfully revealed 14 of 16 esophageal cancers and all seven submucosal tumors. Two esophageal cancers, both confined to the mucosal layer, were undetected. The Az values of the MDCT images were 0.954-0.957 for determining the presence of a lesion and 0.954-0.995 for differentiating between cancer and submucosal tumors. The overall accuracies for T and N staging were 42.9% and 85.7%, respectively. In 80% and 74% of cases, CTE gave similar or superior information to barium study and endoscopy, respectively. MDCT esophagography has the potential to serve as a comprehensive imaging modality for evaluating esophageal tumors as it provides accurate information regarding the detection and characterization of esophageal tumors as well as the similar information to conventional studies."

Nanometer scale objects hypothesized to be a type of bacteria (nanobacteria) are associated with calcified geological specimens, human kidney stones, and psammona bodies in ovarian cancer. Experiments were designed to evaluate human vascular tissue for the presence of similar nanometer-scale objects. Calcified human aneurysms (n = 8), carotid plaques (n = 2), femoral arterial plaques (n = 2), and cardiac valves (n = 2) and noncalcified aneurysms from patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease (n = 2) were collected as surgical waste from the Heart Hospital of Austin, Austin, Texas, and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Whole mounts or adjacent sections from each specimen were examined by electron microscopy, stained for calcium phosphate, or stained with a commercially available antibody (8D10). Filtered (0.2 microm) homogenates of aneurysms were cultured and costained with 8D10 antibody followed by PicoGreen to detect DNA or incubated with [3H]uridine. Staining for calcium phosphate was heterogeneously distributed within all calcified tissues. Immunological staining with 8D10 was also heterogeneously distributed in areas with and without calcium phosphate. Analysis of areas with positive immunostaining identified spheres ranging in size from 30 to 100 nm with a spectral pattern of calcium and phosphorus (high-energy dispersive spectroscopy). Nanosized particles cultured from calcified but not from noncalcified aneurysms were recognized by a DNA-specific dye and incorporated radiolabeled uridine, and, after decalcification, they appeared via electron microscopy to contain cell walls. Therefore, nanometer-scale particles similar to those described as nanobacteria isolated from geological specimens and human kidney stones can be visualized in and cultured from calcified human cardiovascular tissue."

CD011126,0,20171938,0,The role of two- and three-dimensional dynamic ultrasonography in pelvic organ prolapse.,"The assessment of pelvic organ prolapse has to date been limited to the clinical evaluation of surface anatomy. This is clearly insufficient. As a result, imaging of pelvic floor function and anatomy is moving from the fringes to the mainstream of obstetrics and gynecology. This is mainly due to the realization that pelvic floor trauma in labor is common, generally overlooked, and a major factor in the causation of pelvic organ prolapse. Modern imaging methods such as magnetic resonance and 3-dimensional ultrasonography have enabled us to diagnose such abnormalities reliably and accurately, most commonly in the form of an avulsion of the puborectalis muscle off its insertion on the os pubis. However, ultrasonography has other advantages in the assessment of pelvic organ prolapse, most notably in the differential diagnosis of posterior compartment prolapse, which can be due to at least 5 different conditions. In this review I will try to summarize the methods of prolapse and pelvic floor assessment by translabial ultrasonography and to describe the most common abnormalities and their consequences. This article will not deal with magnetic resonance imaging because I consider this technology to be of limited clinical utility due to technical restrictions, expense, and access issues."

CD011126,0,23804346,0,First experience using 4-dimensional hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography with SonoVue for assessing fallopian tube patency.,"This study was conducted to describe our first experience using transvaginal 4-dimensional (4D) hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography with SonoVue (Bracco International BV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) for diagnosis of fallopian tube patency. The study was prospective and conducted in a university hospital setting. The sonographic procedures included 2-dimensional transvaginal sonography for evaluating uterine and ovarian mobility, observing intubation, and determining the initial plane and 4D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography for observing periovarian and pelvic diffusion. Ninety-six outpatients visiting infertility clinics underwent 4D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography. All patients finished the examination successfully. A total of 192 fallopian tubes were assessed, of which 95 (49.5%) were classified as type A (the tube was patent, and the contrast agent flowed smoothly through it), 72 (37.5%) as type B (the tube was patent, but the contrast agent did not flow smoothly inside it), and 25 (13.0%) as type C (blocked). Sixteen patients underwent laparoscopy or laparoscopy combined with hysteroscopy; 28 tubes (87.5%) were concordant with laparoscopy. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and Youden index for 4D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography versus laparoscopy were 81.8%, 90.5%, 81.8%, 90.5%, and 0.72 respectively. In total, 92.7% of patients did not require a hospital stay after 4D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography, and none need resuscitation. The others stayed in the hospital for clinical observation because of a severe vasovagal reaction or severe pain but received only bed rest without any medical treatment. Forty patients (41.7%) felt slight pain; 39 (40.6%) felt moderate pain; and 15 (15.6%) had a vasovagal reaction. No procedure or postprocedure complications occurred in any patient. In conclusion, 4D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography with SonoVue is an available screening method for assessment of tubal patency and is tolerable for most patients."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasound characteristics of the SVs of infertile patients with DM because no such data are available in these patients. To accomplish this, 25 infertile patients with type 2 DM and no other known causes of sperm parameter abnormalities were selected. Two different control groups were also enrolled: healthy men with idiopathic infertility (n=25) and infertile patients with male accessory gland infections (MAGI) (n=25), a well-studied clinical model of SV inflammation. Patients and controls underwent prostate-vesicular transrectal ultrasonography after 1 day of sexual abstinence before and 1h after ejaculation. The following SV ultrasound parameters were recorded: (1) body antero-posterior diameter (ADP); (2) fundus APD; (3) parietal thickness of the right and left SVs; (4) number of polycyclic areas within both SVs; (5) fundus/body ratio; (6) difference of the parietal thickness between the right and the left SV; and (7) pre- and post-ejaculatory APD difference. Patients with DM had a significantly (p<0.05) higher F/B ratio compared to controls and patients with MAGI. Only patients with MAGI had a significantly (p<0.05) higher number of polycyclic areas. Controls and MAGI patients have a similar pre- and post-ejaculatory difference of the body SV APD, whereas this difference was significantly (p<0.05) lower in patients with DM. In conclusion, this study showed that infertile patients with DM have peculiar SV ultrasound features suggestive of functional atony."
CD011126,0,15554123,0,Colonic polyp segmentation in CT colonography-based on fuzzy clustering and deformable models.,"An automatic method to segment colonic polyps in computed tomography (CT) colonography is presented in this paper. The method is based on a combination of knowledge-guided intensity adjustment, fuzzy c-mean clustering, and deformable models. The computer segmentations were compared with manual segmentations to validate the accuracy of our method. An average 76.3% volume overlap percentage among 105 polyp detections was reported in the validation, which was very good considering the small polyp size. Several experiments were performed to investigate the intraoperator and interoperator repeatability of manual colonic polyp segmentation. The investigation demonstrated that the computer-human repeatability was as good as the interoperator repeatability. The polyp segmentation was also applied in computer-aided detection (CAD) to reduce the number of false positive (FP) detections and provide volumetric features for polyp classification. Our segmentation method was able to eliminate 30% of FP detections. The volumetric features computed from the segmentation can further reduce FP detections by 50% at 80% sensitivity."

CD011126,0,16616366,0,Inducing hepatic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in pellet culture.,"Extensive cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction in three-dimensional (3D) culture is important for the maintenance of adult hepatocyte function and the maturation of hepatic progenitors. However, although there is significant interest in inducing the transdifferentiation of adult stem cells into the hepatic lineage, very few studies have been conducted in a 3D culture configuration. The aim of this study is to investigate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into hepatocytes in a pellet configuration, with or without the presence of small intestinal submucosa (SIS). After 4 weeks of differentiation with growth factors bFGF, HGF, and OsM, we obtained hepatocyte-like cells that expressed a subset of hepatic genes, secreted albumin and urea, stored glycogen, and showed inducible CYP3A4 mRNA levels. When these cells were implanted into livers of hepatectomized rats, they secreted human albumin into the bloodstream. The hepatic differentiation of MSC was faster in cell pellets without SIS. The plausible explanations for this finding may be related to the mass transport issues of the two different pellets and the role of cell-cell contact over cell-matrix interactions. The findings of this study should help in the design of optimal culture configurations for efficient hepatic differentiation of adult stem cells."

CD011126,0,21062986,0,Synergistic enhancement of carboplatin efficacy with photodynamic therapy in a three-dimensional model for micrometastatic ovarian cancer.,"Metastatic ovarian cancer (OvCa) frequently recurs due to chemoresistance, highlighting the need for nonoverlapping combination therapies that mechanistically synergize to eradicate residual disease. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a photochemistry-based cytotoxic modality, sensitizes ovarian tumors to platinum agents and biologics and has shown clinical promise against ovarian carcinomatosis. We introduce a three-dimensional (3D) model representing adherent ovarian micrometastases and high-throughput quantitative imaging methods to rapidly screen the order-dependent effects of combining benzoporphyrin-derivative (BPD) monoacid A-based PDT with low-dose carboplatin. 3D ovarian micronodules grown on Matrigel were subjected to BPD-PDT either before or after carboplatin treatment. We developed custom fluorescence image analysis routines to quantify residual tumor volume and viability. Carboplatin alone did not eradicate ovarian micrometastases at a dose of 400 mg/m2, leaving surviving cores that were nonsensitive or impermeable to chemotherapy. BPD-PDT (1.25 μmol/L·J/cm2) created punctate cytotoxic regions within tumors and disrupted micronodular structure. Treatment with BPD-PDT prior to low-dose carboplatin (40 mg/m2) produced a significant synergistic reduction [P<0.0001, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)] in residual tumor volume [0.26; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.19-0.36] compared with PDT alone (0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.92) or carboplatin alone (0.95; 95% CI, 0.83-1.09), relative to controls. This synergism was not observed with the reverse treatment order. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the use of a 3D model for micrometastatic OvCa as a rapid and quantitative reporter to optimize sequence and dosing regimens of clinically relevant combination strategies. This approach combining biological modeling with high-content imaging provides a platform to rapidly screen therapeutic strategies for a broad array of metastatic tumors."

Comparisons of these electron density maps, at resolutions of between 13 and 16 A, with that of a nontranslating ribosome pinpoint specific structural differences in stalled ribosomes and identify additional material, including tRNAs and mRNA. In addition, the tunnel through the large subunit, the anticipated exit route of newly synthesized proteins, is partially occluded in all the stalled ribosome structures. This observation suggests that significant segments of the nascent polypeptide chains examined here could be located within an expanded tunnel, perhaps in a rudimentary globular conformation. Such behavior could be an important aspect of the folding of at least some proteins in the cellular environment."

CD011126,0,25748646,0,Seeing is saving: the benefit of 3D imaging in gynecologic brachytherapy.,"Despite a concerning decline in the use of brachytherapy over the past decade, no other therapy is able to deliver a very high dose of radiation into or near a tumor, with a rapid fall-off of dose to adjacent structures. Compared to traditional X-ray-based brachytherapy that relies on points, the use of CT and MR for 3D planning of gynecologic brachytherapy provides a much more accurate volume-based calculation of dose to an image-defined tumor and to the bladder, rectum, sigmoid, and other pelvic organs at risk (OAR) for radiation complications. The publication of standardized guidelines and an online contouring teaching atlas for performing 3D image-based brachytherapy has created a universal platform for communication and training. This has resulted in a uniform approach to using image-guided brachytherapy for treatment and an internationally accepted format for reporting clinical outcomes. Significant improvements in survival and reductions in toxicity have been reported with the addition of image guidance to increase dose to tumor and decrease dose to the critical OAR. Future improvements in individualizing patient treatments should include a more precise definition of the target. This will allow dose modulation based on the amount of residual disease visualized on images obtained at the time of brachytherapy."
CD011126,0,17376650,0,CAD in CT colonography without and with oral contrast agents: progress and challenges.,"Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, is an emerging alternative technique for screening of colon cancers. CTC uses CT to provide a series of cross-sectional images of the colon for detection of polyps and masses. Fecal tagging is a means of labeling of residual feces by an oral contrast agent for improving the accuracy in the detection of polyps. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for CTC automatically determines the locations of suspicious polyps and masses in CTC and presents them to radiologists, typically as a second opinion. Despite its relatively short history, CAD has become one of the mainstream techniques that could make CTC prime time for screening of colorectal cancer. Rapid technical developments have advanced CAD substantially during the last several years, and a fundamental scheme for the detection of polyps has been established, in which sophisticated 3D image processing, analysis, and display techniques play a pivotal role. The latest CAD systems indicate a clinically acceptable high sensitivity and a low false-positive rate, and observer studies have demonstrated the benefits of these systems in improving radiologists' detection performance. Some technical and clinical challenges, however, remain unresolved before CAD can become a truly useful tool for clinical practice. Also, new challenges are facing CAD as the methods for bowel preparation and image acquisition, such as tagging of fecal residue with oral contrast agents, and interpretation of CTC images evolve. This article reviews the current status and future challenges in CAD for CTC without and with fecal tagging."

The effect of premature ovarian failure (or premature menopause) on endothelial function in young women is unknown. Endothelial function was assessed in 18 women with premature ovarian failure before and after 6 months of hormone therapy and was compared with the endothelial function of 20 age- and body mass index-matched premenopausal women. Brachial artery diameter was measured both during hyperemia (an index of endothelium-dependent vasodilation) and in response to glyceryl trinitrate (an index of endothelium-independent vaso-dilation). Flow-mediated dilation was significantly lower in women with premature ovarian failure at baseline (increase in brachial artery diameter during hyperemia by 3.06 +/- 4.33%) than in control women (increase by 8.84 +/- 2.15%; P < 0.0005). Glyceryl trinitrate-induced vasodilation did not differ between the groups. After hormone therapy for 6 months, flow-mediated dilation was improved in women with premature ovarian failure, increasing by more than 2-fold (7.41 +/- 3.86%; P < 0.005 compared with pretreatment) and reaching normal values (P not significant compared with control women). Glyceryl trinitrate-induced vasodilation did not change after treatment in women with premature ovarian failure. Young women with premature ovarian failure have significant vascular endothelial dysfunction. Early onset of endothelial dysfunction associated with sex steroid deficiency may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in young women with premature ovarian failure. Hormone therapy restores endothelial function within 6 months of treatment."

A 20-year-old nulligravid woman presented with a large solid pelvic mass and abdominal mass. On examination a solid mass was found which extended from the pelvis until over the umbilical transversal line. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a solid non-homogenous mass originating from the right ovary with largest diameter of over 30 cm, fine internal echoes, regular margins, and poor vascularization. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) image was non-contributory. Blood work including hematology and biochemistry was normal. There was no sign of systemic infection and the tumour markers are negative. Unilateral adnexectomy was performed during exploratory laparotomy. Histological examination demonstrated massive ovarian edema. The adnexa weighted 1,585 g. Massive edema of the ovary remains difficult to diagnose before surgery because it may clinically and radiologically mimic an ovarian neoplasm. The majority of cases present with recurrent abdominal pain or a palpable adnexal mass. Nausea with or without vomiting can be present. Menstrual irregularities are common. Some patients have signs of masculinization including hirsutism, clitoromegaly, voice deepening, precocious puberty. However, this entity should be considered in young women presenting with an ovarian mass and abdominal pain. Treatment of massive ovarian edema is controversial."

One hundred and seventy-five female patients with small pelvic masses after hysterectomy were examined. For the specification of the pattern of small pelvic masses and their differential diagnosis, USS and MRI were carried out in 175 and 72 patients, respectively. Four groups of the masses were identified; of them there were tumor-like masses of the uterine appendages in 67 (38.2%) patients, ovarian tumors in 31 (17.7%), other additional masses of the small pelvis in 27 (15.4%), and a mixed variant of its masses in 50 (28.5%). The findings suggest that it is reasonable to concurrently use USS and MRI in the diagnosis of small pelvic masses following hysterectomy for the specification of their pattern and their differential diagnosis. The benefit of MRI is that information images of the basic structures of the small pelvis can be obtained in patients with a marked commissural process after hysterectomy in the absence of limitations in large mass sizes. Practical guidelines were proposed to comprehensively use USS and MRI for the diagnosis of small pelvic pathology."

We retrospectively analyzed the endocrinological and clinical features of 79 hyperprolactinemic patients detected during a 3-year period ending in March 1995. Patients who had hypothyroidism, macroprolactinoma and drug-induced hyperprolactinemia were excluded from the study. Among 61 hyperprolactinemic patients, 41 (67.2%) had ultrasonographically diagnosed polycystic ovaries (PCO). Prolactin levels in the PCO and non-PCO groups were 32.8 +/- 5.8 and 36.7 +/- 5.1 ng/dl, respectively, which was a significant difference (p < 0.05). Hirsutism was associated with hyperprolactinemia in 55.7% of the patients and was found to be more frequent in the PCO (58.8%) than the non-PCO group (41.2%). The mean Ferriman Gallwey scores and both total and free testosterone levels were significantly higher in the PCO group in comparison to the non-PCO group. In addition, a significantly higher body mass index was detected in patients with PCO.

A clinical examination is necessary to provide an accurate diagnosis and find complications such as anaemia. Pelvic ultrasound examination and endometrial biopsy are required to eliminate endometrial cancer.

The new FIGO classification gives 7 positions (0 to 7), submuccus (0, 1, 2), interstitial (3, 4, 5), subserous (6, 7). Diagnosis is performed by 2D and 3D ultrasound which could be associated by hysterosonography. Hysteroscopy and MRI could be proposed. Hysterectomy is the main treatment, if possible by vaginal or laparoscopic way. Conservative treatment (myomectomy) could be realized by hysteroscopic, laparoscopic way or laparotomy for patients who desire to preserve fertility. Arteries embolisation is an alternative to hysterectomy or myomectomy for patients without desire of pregnancy. Preoperative treatments by GnRH agonist or SPRM like ulipristal acetate treat anaemia, decrease the myoma volume and could modify the therapeutic strategy."
CD011126,0,20954237,0,Probing the active site of the sugar isomerase domain from E. coli arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase via X-ray crystallography.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis represents an underexploited target pathway for novel antimicrobial development to combat the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. A key player in LPS synthesis is the enzyme D-arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase (API), which catalyzes the reversible isomerization of D-ribulose-5-phosphate to D-arabinose-5-phosphate, a precursor of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate that is an essential residue of the LPS inner core. API is composed of two main domains: an N-terminal sugar isomerase domain (SIS) and a pair of cystathionine-β-synthase domains of unknown function. As the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme is a prerequisite for the rational development of novel inhibitors, we present here the crystal structure of the SIS domain of a catalytic mutant (K59A) of E. coli D-arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase at 2.6-Å resolution. Our structural analyses and comparisons made with other SIS domains highlight several potentially important active site residues. In particular, the crystal structure allowed us to identify a previously unpredicted His residue (H88) located at the mouth of the active site cavity as a possible catalytic residue. On the basis of such structural data, subsequently supported by biochemical and mutational experiments, we confirm the catalytic role of H88, which appears to be a generally conserved residue among two-domain isomerases."

As a result, the current clinical presentation of complete hydatidiform moles has clearly changed compared to that of the classic type of mole. The diagnosis of molar pregnancy is nearly always made by ultrasonography. Ultrasonography does not, however, always lead to diagnosis in the very early stages of gestation, before the chorionic villi have attained the characteristic vesicular pattern. Therefore, a histopathological examination of the products of conception should be required in all such cases. Hydatidiform moles should be treated by evacuating the uterus surgically as soon as possible after diagnosis.

Sonographic evidence of a pleural effusion can be obtained from 5 ml onwards and is much more sensitive than a chest X-ray, especially in supine position; false positive findings are not encountered. A more accurate estimation of the quantity of effusion can be made. Exudates are echogenic in one third of cases. Pleural thickening, nodular changes in the pleura, septa, and the formation of the quality of effusion can be made. Exual exudates, whereas transudates are always anechoic. Pleural metastases are characteristically hypoechoic and nodular-polypoid. Pleural mesotheliomas can be delineated nearly equally well on sonograms and on computed tomography. Morphological and, in particular, functional diagnosis of the diaphragm by means of sonography is both reliable and convincing."

Because of refusal of invasive monitoring, thoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) was performed to evaluate cardiac function and volume status. TEB pointed out decreased cardiac output (CO: 4.23 liters/min), cardiac index (CI: 2.63) and stroke volume (SV: 57.5 ml/beat). Serial monitoring of hemodynamic variables was then performed. After the data were obtained, fluid management was performed, and the patient recovered from abnormal homeostasis in 3 days. The hemodynamic variables returned to the normal range (CO: 6.85 liters/min, CI: 4.25, SV: 100.5 ml/beat) within the first 24 h.

CD011126,0,24210440,0,Obstetric (nonfetal) complications.,"Pregnancy predisposes women to a wide array of obstetric and gynecological complications which are often complex, challenging and sometimes life-threatening. While some of these are unique to pregnancy, a few that occur in nonpregnant women are more common during pregnancy. Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of pregnancy-related obstetric and gynecologic complications. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging confer the least risk to the fetus and should be the preferred examinations for evaluating these complications. Multidetector computed tomography should be used after carefully weighing the risk-benefit ratio based on the clinical condition in question. Interventional radiology is emerging as a preferred, noninvasive or minimally invasive treatment option that can obviate surgery and its antecedent short term and long term complications.

The aim of this study was to assess the value of three-dimensional ultrasound viewing options: multi-planar view (MPV) and volume contrast imaging (VCI) in the endometrial evaluation. 147 women, referred for endometrial sampling, because of bleeding or an abnormal endometrial two-dimensional ultrasound image were enrolled in the study. Before dilation and curettage, all patients underwent three-dimension ultrasound scans for endometrial thickness measurements and endometrial-myometrial junction assessment. Ultrasound results and the presence of abnormal vaginal bleeding were compared with pathological diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for abnormal vaginal bleeding, irregular endometrial-myometrial junction and endometrial thickness were established. Logistic regression model was used to assessed the relationship between the characteristics and the incidence of endometrial pathology. For each of the independent variables odds ratios were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity of the endometrial thickness cut-off 11 mm were 73.8%, 74.4%, for 10.5 mm 76.2%, 69.8% respectively. The irregular endometrial-myometrial junction reached 70.5% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Odds ratios for 10,5 mm cu-off value of the endometrial thickening and irregular E-M junction were calculated: 4.10 [95% CI: 1.14-14.74] and 36.07 [95% CI: 7.10-183.27]. The negative predictive value of any of these parameters did not exceed 70%. The combination of 3D ultrasound parameters and the occurrence of abnormal vaginal bleeding has reached only 53% sensitivity. In the case of connection of two of these three indices, increased sensitivity of 76.9% and specificity of 82.4%. In an unselected group of women in terms of menopausal status and symptoms endometrial thickness measured and the evaluation of endometrial-myometrial junction using 3D ultrasound is less value in predicting the occurrence of endometrial cancer than in 2D and the endometrial volume calculation."

CD011126,0,15451336,0,Ability of the clinician and patient to predict the outcome of mifepristone and misoprostol medical abortion.,"We performed this analysis to evaluate the ability of both women and their clinicians to predict pregnancy expulsion after using mifepristone and misoprostol for medical abortion up to 63 days gestation. Women who participated in a multicenter, randomized trial comparing misoprostol 6-8 h vs. 23-25 h after mifepristone attended a follow-up visit approximately 7 days after mifepristone treatment. Each subject was asked if she felt she had expelled the gestational sac. Clinicians also assessed if the sac had been expelled based on the woman's history. Vaginal ultrasonography was then performed to assess the uterine cavity. Of the 1080 women enrolled in the multicenter study, 931 (86.2%) who attended the first follow-up visit by study day 12 and did not have a uterine suction aspiration prior to this visit were included in this analysis. Vaginal ultrasonography at the first follow-up visit demonstrated expulsion in 915 [98.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 97.2-99.0] women. Overall, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for subjects were 96.5%, 31.3%, 98.8% and 13.5%, respectively. When both the clinician and patient felt that the gestational sac had passed (n = 880 [94.5%, 95% CI: 92.9-95.9]), expulsion was confirmed by sonography in 99.1% (95% CI: 98.2-99.6) of cases.

From January 2003 to December 2003, a total of 73 patients (47 premenopausal (middle age 38.9) and 26 postmenopausal women (middle age 60.5)) underwent transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) and sonohysterography (SHG), consisting of an intrauterine infusion of saline solution during transvaginal ultrasound. The women referred to our Ultrasonography Center because of intermenstrual (38) or postmenopausal bleeding (19), or an abnormal or a poorly defined endometrial interface (16) as seen as baseline ultrasonography. The findings at TVS and SHG were compared with hysteroscopy (HS). In one case, the SHG was technically impossible to perform. In premenopausal group the sensitivity of SHG had been 100% in detecting submucosal fibroids, endometrial polyps and hyperplasia and 75% in detecting normal uterus. The specificity had been always 100%. In postmenopausal group the sensitivity of SHG had been 75% in detecting submucosal fibroids, 93.8% in endometrial polyps and 100% in hyperplasia and normal uterus. The specificity had been 100% in submucosal fibroids and hyperplasia and had been 90.0 and 95.5% in endometrial polyps and normal uterus, respectively. SHG allows to obtain a precise diagnosis of benign uterine pathology and it is more accurate in the diagnosis of intracavitary abnormalities than that obtained by TVS. Preoperative use of SHG may assist in choosing the best surgical treatment for the patient."

CD011126,0,15187341,0,Merkel cells in the vellus hair follicles of human facial skin: a study using confocal laser microscopy.,"Many cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have recently been reported, and most of them have been localized on the facial skin. In this study, we investigated Merkel cells in the vellus hair follicles of facial region to characterize these cells in human subjects. Skin specimens doubly stained with cytokeratin (CK) 20 and either protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 or vasoreactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were examined by confocal laser microscopy. Many of the Merkel cells in the vellus hair follicles of the facial skin were localized in the bulge area. Some of these cells were attached to nerve terminals, although most of them were not associated with them. Our results suggest that there are two types of Merkel cells in the bulge area of the vellus hair follicles of facial skin: cells wholly unassociated with the nerve terminals and cells associated with thin nerve fibers. We postulate that the former cells may be undifferentiated (immature) and the latter differentiated (mature). If this is so, there is a chance that Merkel cell carcinoma originates from the undifferentiated Merkel cells in the bulge of the vellus hair with the formation of tumor masses in the dermis and no involvement of the epidermis. The Merkel cells connected with nerve fibers may secrete endocrine substances via a regulation of autonomic nerves."

CD011126,0,18334380,0,A fully automatic CAD-CTC system based on curvature analysis for standard and low-dose CT data.,"Computed tomography colonography (CTC) is a rapidly evolving noninvasive medical investigation that is viewed by radiologists as a potential screening technique for the detection of colorectal polyps. Due to the technical advances in CT system design, the volume of data required to be processed by radiologists has increased significantly, and as a consequence the manual analysis of this information has become an increasingly time consuming process whose results can be affected by inter- and intrauser variability. The aim of this paper is to detail the implementation of a fully integrated CAD-CTC system that is able to robustly identify the clinically significant polyps in the CT data. The CAD-CTC system described in this paper is a multistage implementation whose main system components are: 1) automatic colon segmentation; 2) candidate surface extraction; 3) feature extraction; and 4) classification. Our CAD-CTC system performs at 100% sensitivity for polyps larger than 10 mm, 92% sensitivity for polyps in the range 5 to 10 mm, and 57.14% sensitivity for polyps smaller than 5 mm with an average of 3.38 false positives per dataset.

CD011126,0,20501711,0,Polyp size measurement at CT colonography: what do we know and what do we need to know?,"Polyp size is a critical biomarker for clinical management. Larger polyps have a greater likelihood of being or of becoming an adenocarcinoma. To balance the referral rate for polypectomy against the risk of leaving potential cancers in situ, sizes of 6 and 10 mm are increasingly being discussed as critical thresholds for clinical decision making (immediate polypectomy versus polyp surveillance) and have been incorporated into the consensus CT Colonography Reporting and Data System (C-RADS). Polyp size measurement at optical colonoscopy, pathologic examination, and computed tomographic (CT) colonography has been studied extensively but the reported precision, accuracy, and relative sizes have been highly variable. Sizes measured at CT colonography tend to lie between those measured at optical colonoscopy and pathologic evaluation. The size measurements are subject to a variety of sources of error associated with image acquisition, display, and interpretation, such as partial volume averaging, two- versus three-dimensional displays, and observer variability. This review summarizes current best practices for polyp size measurement, describes the role of automated size measurement software, discusses how to manage the measurement uncertainties, and identifies areas requiring further research."

CD011126,0,15507926,0,The endometrial echo revisited: have we created a monster?,"Transvaginal ultrasound has been explored as an inexpensive, noninvasive, convenient way to indirectly visualize the endometrial cavity. For more than a decade numerous studies have indicated that a thin, distinct, well-visualized echo (<4-5 mm) in postmenopausal women with bleeding is as effective as any diagnostic modality in excluding endometrial cancer (99% negative predictive value). Unfortunately, this is not the same as saying that a thick endometrial echo is pathologic. In fact, the positive predictive value of an echo greater than 5 mm is less than 10% for any disease and only 4% for serious disease (cancer or hyperplasia). No studies validating the clinical significance of a nonthin endometrial echo observed in an incidental imaging study have ever been performed. Because 5 mm has been a ""cutoff"" for excluding endometrial cancers in women with bleeding, many clinicians have assumed that any findings greater than 5 mm need endometrial sampling to exclude disease. The number of postmenopausal women with quiescent fibroids, or polyps, or heterogeneous uterine echoes for technical reasons (previous scarring, axial uterus) is unknown but not insignificant. Furthermore, if transvaginal ultrasound is to be used, it must be performed appropriately, further recognizing that in a substantial number of patients it may not be possible to obtain technically adequate endometrial assessment. So, although transvaginal ultrasound can be a reliable method of excluding disease in many postmenopausal women with bleeding, the incidental finding of a non-thin endometrial echo has not been investigated and should not automatically trigger a need for formal tissue sampling."

CD011126,0,16238103,0,In vivo and in vitro estrogenic and progestagenic actions of Tibolone.,"Estrogen and progestin combination in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the incidence of breast cancer, but decreases the endometrial cancer risk of unopposed estrogen. Therefore, a SERM such as Tibolone, that delivers the beneficial, but not the adverse side effects, of steroid hormones would be clinically advantageous. However, data from the Million Women Study suggests that Tibolone increases the risk of both breast and endometrial cancer. Herein, we assessed the estrogenic and progestagenic actions of Tibolone using transvaginal sonography studies and an in vitro model of breast (ZR-75, MCF7) and endometrial cancer (Ishikawa). The known cancer associated proteins (ER, EGFR, STATS, tissue factor and Bcl-xL) were selected for study. Transvaginal sonography demonstrated that postmenopausal women treated with Tibolone displayed a thinner endometrium than in the late proliferative phase, but had a phenotype characteristic of the secretory phase, thus demonstrating the estrogenic and progestagenic actions of this SERM. In vitro, Tibolone acted as an estrogen in downregulating ER and upregulating Bcl-xL, yet as progesterone, increasing STAT5 and tissue factor in breast cancer cells. The increase in tissue factor by Tibolone correlated with its coagulative potential. Interestingly, EGFR was up-regulated by progesterone in the breast and by estrogen in endometrial cells, while Tibolone increased protein levels in both cell types. In conclusion, this study further demonstrates the estrogenic and progestagenic nature of Tibolone. The pattern of regulation of known oncogenes in cells of breast and endometrial origin dictates caution and vigilance in the prescription of Tibolone and subsequent patient monitoring."
CD011126,0,25406094,0,The characteristic ultrasound features of specific types of ovarian pathology (review).,"Characterizing ovarian masses enables patients with malignancy to be appropriately triaged for treatment by subspecialist gynecological oncologists, which has been shown to optimize care and improve survival. Furthermore, correctly classifying benign masses facilitates the selection of patients with ovarian pathology that may either not require intervention, or be suitable for minimal access surgery if intervention is required. However, predicting whether a mass is benign or malignant is not the only clinically relevant information that we need to know before deciding on appropriate treatment. Knowing the specific histology of a mass is becoming of increasing importance as management options become more tailored to the individual patient. For example predicting a mucinous borderline tumor gives the opportunity for fertility sparing surgery, and will highlight the need for further gastrointestinal assessment. For benign disease, predicting the presence of an endometrioma and possible deeply infiltrating endometriosis is important when considering both who should perform and the extent of surgery. An examiner's subjective assessment of the morphological and vascular features of a mass using ultrasonography has been shown to be highly effective for predicting whether a mass is benign or malignant. Many masses also have features that enable a reliable diagnosis of the specific pathology of a particular mass to be made. In this narrative review we aim to describe the typical morphological features seen on ultrasound of different adnexal masses and illustrate these by showing representative ultrasound images."

CD011126,0,15991529,0,The significance of Doppler flow in early detection of uterine sarcoma in older primigravida pregnancies.,"During a four-year period we analyzed the significance, sensitivity and sensibility of myoma Doppler flow during pregnancy in relation to the course and outcome of the pregnancy and to later histopathological findings. By following 36 older primigravidas with determined myomas, we observed the course of the pregnancies in all trimesters and analyzed myoma Doppler flow. In conditions where the resistance index showed the possibility of uterine sarcoma, the pregnancy was ended by surgery; not only was myomectomy performed but also complete uterine hysterectomy with the previous consent of the patient. Doppler flow was accepted as the authoritative parameter for non-invasive detection of a malignant process. Considering the obstetrical findings, other patients were delivered vaginally or operatively, but after puerperium they were subjected to control examinations and myomectomy because Doppler flow findings did not show any indications of sarcoma. By histopathological analysis, we received benign results in 31 cases, while in four cases where we decided on hysterectomy and surgical delivery, we received malignant results, i.e. leiomyosarcoma. In four cases of performed hysterectomy immediately after cesarean section, the resistance index (RI) of revascularization within the myoma was in the range between RI 0.30 +/- 0.02. Flows within the uterine artery were 0.54 +/- 0.03."

CD011126,0,14699317,0,[Contribution of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy].,"High-resolution endovaginal sonography has considerably improved ectopic pregnancy imaging. In conjunction with serum hCG measurements, it allows early detection of ectopic pregnancy (EP) and has significantly reduced the morbidity and the mortality of this disease. The major sonographic finding is the uterine vacuity, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is quite sure in case of absence of intra-uterine pregnancy (IUP) associated with serum hCG above 1500 mUi/ml. Conversely, the presence of IUP excludes practically the diagnosis of EP, but IUP must be distinguished from a pseudosac. The visualization of an ectopic sac that contains an embryo or a yolk sac clearly allows the diagnosis of EP, but its sensitivity is only 25%. The most common sonographic finding is a hematosalpinx, which looks like an echogenic adnexal mass, next to the ovary containing the corpus luteum. Color Doppler is useful to enhance ectopic trophoblastic flow, but it is only a complementary technique of endovaginal sonography. Finally, if the first sonography is inconclusive, a follow-up examination must be performed 2 or 4 days later."
CD011126,0,25438299,0,Multilabel region classification and semantic linking for colon segmentation in CT colonography.,"Accurate and automatic colon segmentation from CT images is a crucial step of many clinical applications in CT colonography, including computer-aided detection (CAD) of colon polyps, 3-D virtual flythrough of the colon, and prone/supine registration. However, the existence of adjacent air-filled organs such as the lung, stomach, and small intestine, and the collapse of the colon due to poor insufflation, render accurate segmentation of the colon a difficult problem. Extra-colonic components can be categorized into two types based on their 3-D connection to the colon: detached and attached extracolonic components (DEC and AEC, respectively). In this paper, we propose graph inference methods to remove extracolonic components to achieve a high quality segmentation. We first decompose each 3-D air-filled object into a set of 3-D regions. A classifier trained with region-level features can be used to identify the colon regions from noncolon regions. After removing obvious DEC, we remove the remaining DEC by modeling the global anatomic structure with an a priori topological constraint and solving a graph inference problem using semantic information provided by a multiclass classifier. Finally, we remove AEC by modeling regions within each 3-D object with a hierarchical conditional random field, solved by graph cut. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms a purely discriminative learning method in detecting true colon regions, while decreasing extra-colonic components in challenging clinical data that includes collapsed cases."

We hypothesize that the CT scans preformed on these women will all show abnormalities of the involved ovary. Our purpose is to review cases of surgically proven ovarian torsion at our institution over the last 20 years, assessing CT findings in women with ovarian torsion. A retrospective review of all patients at our institution with surgically proven ovarian torsion from 1985-2005 was conducted. Two physicians reviewed available CT reports, and a radiologist reviewed all available images. CT was obtained in 33% of the 167 patients. Dictated reports were available for 28 studies; all described an enlarged ovary, ovarian cyst, or adnexal mass of the involved ovary. Radiologist review of the available CT images confirmed these findings. This series supports the claim that a CT scan with well-visualized normal appearing ovaries rules out ovarian torsion, while abnormal pelvic findings or failure to visualize the ovaries in women with pelvic pain necessitates further evaluation of torsion."

The present report describes a postmenopausal patient with uterine AVM manifesting recurrent, massive genital bleeding. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) was scheduled before hysterectomy, but UAE was unsuccessful due to the dilated, tortuous internal iliac arteries, and extremely rapid arterial blood flow. Hysterectomy appeared to carry a potential risk of massive blood loss due to multiple dilated vessels around the uterine corpus and cervix.

There are two types of such pregnancies:   type 1, in which the embryo starts to progress towards the uterine cavity and may result in live birth despite the high risk of a hemorrhage occurring during birth, and type 2, which consists of pregnancies in which the embryo is embedded deep within the cesarean scar (CS) and grows towards the bladder and abdominal cavity, which is very dangerous and needs to be terminated immediately. There are very few cases in the literature reporting live birth as a result of such pregnancies. Here, we present a 41-year-old single gravid woman who had been treated for infertility at our institute and had eventually conceived through embryonic transfer freezing. At six weeks, a transvaginal scan showed the presence of an EP within the CS but despite this finding the pregnancy was continued to term."

A new referral pathway was instigated in 2000, with patients only being referred to a gynaecologist following an abnormal TVUS result. An initial audit revealed a low positive predictive value for TVUS and a low incidence of detected malignancy. The cut-off value for a normal endometrium was increased from 3 mm to 4 mm in line with published data. This re7hyphen;audit evaluated the effectiveness of implemented changes and identified other areas for improvement. Of the 277 women referred during the study period, 193 had an abnormal or unseen endometrium and were subsequently seen by a gynaecologist. For patients without a histological diagnosis, clinical notes were reviewed and the hospital cancer database scrutinized for all endometrial cancers. Despite a 15.4% increase in referrals, only an additional 2.9% were assessed by gynaecologists. 14 cases of malignancy were identified with a mean endometrial thickness (ET) of 15.7 mm. Failed endometrial sampling was more prevalent with a minimally thickened endometrium. 80 patients with abnormal TVUS had no recorded histological diagnosis. Increasing the ET cut-off value has reduced unnecessary investigations in women at low risk of malignancy. No woman discharged back to her GP has been diagnosed with an endometrial malignancy within 1 year of initial referral. An algorithm has been proposed to further improve the investigation of women with PMB following an abnormal TVUS."

CD011126,0,21403573,0,Surgical resection of a huge cemento-ossifying fibroma in skull base by intraoral approach.,"Cemento-ossifying fibroma, also known as ossifying fibroma, usually occurs in the mandible and less commonly in the maxilla. The huge example in the skull base is even rare. We present a case of a huge cemento-ossifying fibroma arising below the skull base of a 30-year-old woman patient. Radiologic investigations showed a giant, lobulated, heterogeneous calcified hard tissue mass, which is well circumscribed and is a mixture of radiolucent and radiopaque, situated at the rear of the right maxilla to the middle skull base. The tumor expands into the right maxillary sinus and the orbital cavity, fusing with the right maxilla at the maxillary tuberosity and blocking the bilateral choanas, which caused marked proptosis and blurred vision. The tumor was resected successfully by intraoral approach, and pathologic examination confirmed the lesion to be a cemento-ossifying fibroma. This case demonstrates that cemento-ossifying fibroma in the maxilla, not like in the mandible, may appear more aggressive because the extensive growth is unimpeded by anatomic obstacles and that the intraoral approach can be used to excise the tumor in the skull base."

We have used cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to obtain three-dimensional structures of the E.coli chaperonin GroEL complexed with gp31, in the presence of both ATP and ADP. The GroEL-gp31-ADP map has a resolution of 8.2 A, which allows accurate fitting of the GroEL and gp31 crystal structures. Comparison of this fitted structure with that of the GroEL-GroES-ADP structure previously determined by cryo-electron microscopy shows that the folding cage is expanded. The enlarged volume for folding is consistent with the size of the bacteriophage coat protein gp23, which is the major substrate of GroEL-gp31 chaperonin complex. At 56 kDa, gp23 is close to the maximum size limit of a polypeptide that is thought to fit inside the GroEL-GroES folding cage."

The ovarian reserve was studied by measuring the serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), inhibin B, antimullerian hormone (AMH) and the ultrasound antral follicular count (AFC). The patients were randomly treated with or without GnRH-a. At the time of study menstrual function was normal in 21 cases (72.4%), but absent in 8 (27.5%). Mean basal values of FSH, LH, AMH, inhibin B and AFC were normal in patients less than 30 years old and in the group treated four years or less before observation. AFC appeared to be the best marker of reduced ovarian reserve and a combination of AFC-AMH or inhibin B appeared the best predictor. In the GnRH-a group, no women had amenorrhoea, although ovarian reserve assessment was not significantly different from those who were not treated. The time-interval from CHT was the only significant predictor of ovarian function in GnRH-a treated patients. In conclusion, ovarian reserve evaluation, in young patients treated by CHT, can be performed by AFC. GnRH-a treatment does not have a protective effect, but could delay the development of ovarian failure."

All women received transvaginal sonography to assess endometrial thickness (ET), patterns and abnormalities. At the same time, an endometrial biopsy was taken using a Pipelle instrument. The women's age, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were 32.0+/-6.0 years, 27.3+/-6.5 kg/m(2) and 0.82+/-0.06 (mean+/-standard deviation), respectively. Twenty (35.1%) and 19 (33.3%) women were classified as obese by BMI and WHR, respectively. Hypertension was found in 17 (29.8%) women. The prevalence of EH was 45.6%. Most cases were simple EH, and only one (1.75%) was simple EH with atypia. EH prevalence was 48.8% and 35.7% in PCOS and idiopathic anovulatory women, respectively. Age, BMI, WHR and ET did not predict EH, whereas the endometrial hyperechogenic pattern was a clinical predictor of EH with borderline significance. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that almost half of the anovulatory women with amenorrhea had EH and no significant predictor was found. In view of these findings, an endometrial biopsy should be performed in all women with this disorder."

For patients with disseminated metastatic lesions, such as most women with ovarian cancer (OvCa), the progression to treatment resistant disease is almost always fatal. Numerous therapeutic approaches have been developed to eliminate treatment resistant carcinoma, including novel biologic, chemo, radiation, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) regimens. Recently, PDT using the cationic photosensitizer EtNBS was found to be highly effective against therapeutically unresponsive hypoxic and acidic OvCa cellular populations in vitro. To optimize this treatment regimen, we developed a tiered, high-content, image-based screening approach utilizing a biologically relevant OvCa 3D culture model to investigate a small library of side-chain modified EtNBS derivatives. The uptake, localization, and photocytotoxicity of these compounds on both the cellular and nodular levels were observed to be largely mediated by their respective ethyl side chain chemical alterations. In particular, EtNBS and its hydroxyl-terminated derivative (EtNBS-OH) were found to have similar pharmacological parameters, such as their nodular localization patterns and uptake kinetics. Interestingly, these two molecules were found to induce dramatically different therapeutic outcomes: EtNBS was found to be more effective in killing the hypoxic, nodule core cells with superior selectivity, while EtNBS-OH was observed to trigger widespread structural degradation of nodules. This breakdown of the tumor architecture can improve the therapeutic outcome and is known to synergistically enhance the antitumor effects of front-line chemotherapeutic regimens. These results, which would not have been predicted or observed using traditional monolayer or in vivo animal screening techniques, demonstrate the powerful capabilities of 3D in vitro screening approaches for the selection and optimization of therapeutic agents for the targeted destruction of specific cellular subpopulations."
CD011126,0,20121503,0,Menstrual dysfunction in rural young women and the presence of polycystic ovarian syndrome.,"The present study was done to show the incidence of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in rural young women with menstrual irregularities and the correlation with different variables. During the study period, 19,339 women had attended as a gynaecological outpatient unit. A total of 9,096 (47%) of them were of 15-34 years age, of whom 1,182 (13%) had menstrual disturbances. Out of the 1,182 young women, 216 were the study subjects as per inclusion-exclusion criteria, but only 200 could be studied. After complete clinical, ultrasonographic and biochemical evaluation, it was revealed that PCOS is common in rural young women of low socioeconomic class. Such women presenting with menstrual irregularities need to be investigated for the presence of other endocrine disorders which may be present with or without PCOS. PCOS was diagnosed in 100 (50%) women. Of the 100 without PCOS, five had thyroid disorders and of the other 95, 49 (51%) had polycystic ovaries on sonography. Significantly more study objects had a family history of hypertension, diabetes and menstrual irregularities in their mothers. A state of hyperinsulinaemia indicated by a low fasting glucose to insulin ratio was present, even in non-obese women with PCOS."

CD011126,0,23973016,0,Effect of brachytherapy technique and patient characteristics on cervical cancer implant dosimetry.,"Our purpose was to evaluate the relationship between brachytherapy technique and patient characteristics on dose to organs-at-risk (OARs) in patients undergoing high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer. From 1998 to 2008, 31 patients with cervical cancer with full dosimetric data were identified who received definitive external-beam radiation and HDR brachytherapy with tandem and ovoid applicators. Doses were recorded at point A, the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU)-38 rectal point, the ICRU-38 bladder point, the vaginal surface, and the pelvic sidewall. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine the significance of changes in OAR to point A dose ratios with differences in brachytherapy technique or patient characteristics. Patients underwent a median of 5 brachytherapy procedures (range, 3 to 5), with a total of 179 procedures for 31 patients. For all brachytherapy treatments, the average ratios between the doses for the rectal, bladder, vaginal surface, and pelvic sidewall reference points to those at point A were 0.49, 0.59, 1.15, and 0.17, respectively. In general, decreased OAR dose was associated with a lower stage, younger age, increased ovoid size, increased tandem length, and earlier implant number. Increased tandem curvature significantly increased bladder dose and decreased rectal dose. Intravenous anesthesia usage was not correlated with improved dosimetry. This study allowed identification of patient and procedure characteristics influencing OAR dosing. Although the advent of 3-dimensional (3D) image-guided brachytherapy will bring new advances in treatment optimization, the actual technique involved at the time of the brachytherapy implant procedure will remain important."
CD011126,0,26028491,0,[Specificities of sex-cord stromal tumors in children and adolescents].,"Sex-cord stromal tumors (SCT) are rare pediatric tumors accounting for less than 5% of gonadal tumors in children and adolescents. They differ from those diagnosed in adults by their presentation, histology, evolution and treatment modalities. Testicular SCT occur mostly in infants less than 6 months. Testicular swelling is often the only symptom, but signs of hormonal secretion with gynecomastia may be present. Juvenile granulosa SCT is the main histologic subtype. Sertoli SCTs are much less frequent while Leydig tumors occurred in older children and adolescents. Prognosis is excellent after inguinal orchiectomy. Testis sparing surgery could be performed but indications and modalities have to be strongly defined. Ovarian SCT are diagnosed in older children and adolescents and present with abdominal symptoms and/or signs of hormonal secretion: estrogenic manifestations (isosexual pseudoprecocity, menometrorrhagia) or virilization (hirsutism, amenorrhea). Main histologic subtype is juvenile granulosa (rarely Sertoli-Leydig). If oophorectomy (or salpingo-oophorectomy) may be curative for localized disease, adjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapy is mandatory in case of tumor rupture or peritoneal dissemination to prevent recurrences. Because of the rarity of these pediatric tumors, concerted multidisciplinary cares are required to best adapt therapeutic strategy before any surgical intervention."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS. CT colonography was performed in 22 patients using 4-MDCT followed by conventional colonoscopy on the same day. The CT colonography data sets were analyzed by virtual colon dissection, which virtually bisects and unfolds the colon along its longitudinal axis to inspect the inner colonic surface for polyps. The same CT data sets were independently evaluated using axial interpretation. All data sets were independently interpreted by two radiologists in a blinded manner."
CD011126,0,21723482,0,ACR appropriateness criteria(®) on abnormal vaginal bleeding.,"In evaluating a woman with abnormal vaginal bleeding, imaging cannot replace definitive histologic diagnosis but often plays an important role in screening, characterization of structural abnormalities, and directing appropriate patient care. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is generally the initial imaging modality of choice, with endometrial thickness a well-established predictor of endometrial disease in postmenopausal women. Endometrial thickness measurements of ≤5 mm and ≤4 mm have been advocated as appropriate upper threshold values to reasonably exclude endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding; however, the best upper threshold endometrial thickness in the asymptomatic postmenopausal patient remains a subject of debate. Endometrial thickness in a premenopausal patient is a less reliable indicator of endometrial pathology since this may vary widely depending on the phase of menstrual cycle, and an upper threshold value for normal has not been well-established. Transabdominal ultrasound is generally an adjunct to TVUS and is most helpful when TVUS is not feasible or there is poor visualization of the endometrium. Hysterosonography may also allow for better delineation of both the endometrium and focal abnormalities in the endometrial cavity, leading to hysteroscopically directed biopsy or resection. Color and pulsed Doppler may provide additional characterization of a focal endometrial abnormality by demonstrating vascularity. MRI may also serve as an important problem-solving tool if the endometrium cannot be visualized on TVUS and hysterosonography is not possible, as well as for pretreatment planning of patients with suspected endometrial carcinoma. CT is generally not warranted for the evaluation of patients with abnormal bleeding, and an abnormal endometrium incidentally detected on CT should be further evaluated with TVUS."

Recognition of the etiology of these findings is important for appropriate diagnosis and, at times, patient care. Many of these findings are truly incidental and clinically unimportant but other times can be related to the patient's chief complaint."

In several human malignancies progression from benign to invasive tumour occurs, but this sequence has not been established for epithelial ovarian cancer. We have reviewed epidemiological, histopathological and molecular studies of benign epithelial ovarian tumours to assess the evidence for and against such a progression in ovarian cancer. These data suggest that a diagnosis of a benign ovarian cyst or tumour is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer later in life. Current evidence also suggests that benign serous tumours can progress to low-grade serous cancer and that benign mucinous tumours can progress to mucinous cancer. The more common high-grade serous ovarian cancers are likely to arise de novo."

The detection and diagnosis of the non-polypoid colorectal neoplasm presents a challenge and an opportunity. Above all, characteristic colonoscopic findings obtained by a combination of conventional colonoscopy and magnifying chromoendoscopy are useful for determination of the invasion depth of non-polypoid colorectal cancers, an essential factor in selecting a treatment modality."
CD011126,0,23157054,0,Early ovarian pregnancy diagnosed by ultrasound and successfully treated with multidose methotrexate. A case report.,"A case report of a primary interstitial ovarian pregnancy is presented. A 37-year-old married woman with two children after two Cesarean sections and a spontaneous abortion, with a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) inserted three years before, presented at five weeks plus five days amenorrhea with a positive pregnancy test and lower abdominal pain but with no vaginal bleeding. Her previous menstrual cycles had been regular. She was hemodynamically stable. On bimanual examination, the uterus was of normal size, and there was an approximate four-cm tender right adnexal mass. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) was confirmed positive. Ultrasound revealed a well-positioned IUD in the uterus and a right adnexal mass with normal vascular flow on Doppler, that contained a well-defined gestational sac, well-distinct from the quiescent hemorrhagic corpus luteum. There was no fetal node or cardiac activity or free fluid. The patient received four injections of methotrexate intramuscularly using the multidose regimen that involves the administration of methotrexate calculated according to body weight, alternated with 0.1 mg/kg of leucovorin calcium per os after 30 hours until the values of 3-hCG had decreased by 15%. The patient's post-treatment period was uneventful with a full restoration of ovarian morphology and the complete absorption of the gestational sac. This case is the first where diagnosis was made by endovaginal sonography and treatment was made by multidose methotrexate. Spiegelberg criteria for the diagnosis of ovarian pregnancy are obsolete; new ultrasound and laboratory criteria are needed for a diagnosis as early as possible without the need of surgery."

CD011126,0,22217897,0,Emergency ultrasound diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis in the pediatric emergency department: a case series.,"The diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) has traditionally been limited to examinations by radiologists and ultrasound technicians. Although contrast venography is considered the criterion standard for diagnosis of DVT, time, personnel, cost, exposure to radiation, and the invasive nature of the study (need for venous access) potentially limit the ability to perform the study in an emergent setting. Ultrasonography is an alternative method for thrombus detection and is widely preferred. However, in many health care settings, consultative ultrasound services may not be available immediately, especially after hours and on weekends. Based on recent studies demonstrating accuracy in adult patients, emergency sonographic evaluation of DVT by emergency physicians is considered a core emergency ultrasound application and is recently recommended as standard training to all emergency medicine residents. The diagnosis of DVT in children by emergency ultrasound in the pediatric ED has not been previously described. We present 3 cases of DVT in adolescents identified by emergency ultrasound evaluation in the pediatric ED."

Although many of the mixed-type cases such as lipoleiomyoma and fibrolipoma have been reported, pure uterine lipomas are extremely rare. In the literature, a few cases with pure uterine lipoma have been reported. We first present the advanced magnetic resonance findings of pure uterine lipoma, followed by those of ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT). We markedly detected lipid peaks on the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and the apparent diffusion coefficient value to be 0.00 due to chemical-shift effects with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Although pelvic lipomatous tumors can be diagnosed with US and CT, in some cases, further workup may be required to localize the lesion. MRI may yield more valuable data for differential diagnosis. MRS and DWI findings provide additional clues on the nature of the lesion."
CD011126,0,23342900,0,Testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs) as a male infertility factor. Case report.,"Since testes and adrenal cortex derive from the same urogenital ridge, adrenal tissue with descending gonads may migrate in early embryonic period. Although most often ectopic tissue undergoes atrophy in some cases, when adrenocorticotrophic (ACTH) overstimulation occurs, the adrenal remnants in the testes may become hypertrophic and form testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs). The growth of TARTs in the testes leads to obstruction of the seminiferous tubules which can mechanically impair the function of the gonads and cause irreversible azoospermia. We describe a patient suffering since neonatal period from congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), disorder with defected pathway of cortisol production, which leads to increased ACTH production and to overstimulation of adrenal cortex. He had very poor disease control and therefore in late puberty he was diagnosed with TARTs. At the age of 19.5 he was diagnosed with azoospermia, most likely caused by TARTs. It is the first evidence of TARTs in Polish literature. Although not many cases have been published so far the incidence of TARTs seems to be highly underdiagnosed, so it seems reasonable to consider the disease in differential diagnosis of male infertility."
CD011126,0,21045152,0,Ki-67 as a molecular target for therapy in an in vitro three-dimensional model for ovarian cancer.,"Targeting molecular markers and pathways implicated in cancer cell growth is a promising avenue for developing effective therapies. Although the Ki-67 protein (pKi-67) is a key marker associated with aggressively proliferating cancer cells and poor prognosis, its full potential as a therapeutic target has never before been successfully shown. In this regard, its nuclear localization presents a major hurdle because of the need for intracellular and intranuclear delivery of targeting and therapeutic moieties. Using a liposomally encapsulated construct, we show for the first time the specific delivery of a Ki-67-directed antibody and subsequent light-triggered death in the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-5. Photoimmunoconjugate-encapsulating liposomes (PICEL) were constructed from anti-pKi-67 antibodies conjugated to fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate, as a photoactivatable agent, followed by encapsulation in noncationic liposomes. Nucleolar localization of the PICELs was confirmed by confocal imaging. Photodynamic activation with PICELs specifically killed pKi-67-positive cancer cells both in monolayer and in three-dimensional (3D) cultures of OVCAR-5 cells, with the antibody TuBB-9 targeting a physiologically active form of pKi-67 but not with MIB-1, directed to a different epitope. This is the first demonstration of (a) the exploitation of Ki-67 as a molecular target for therapy and (b) specific delivery of an antibody to the nucleolus in monolayer cancer cells and in an in vitro 3D model system. In view of the ubiquity of pKi-67 in proliferating cells in cancer and the specificity of targeting in 3D multicellular acini, these findings are promising and the approach merits further investigation."

CD011126,0,20888688,0,Three-dimensional sonographic volume measurement of the fetal stomach.,"The objective of this study was to measure the fetal gastric volume using three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound during pregnancy. Three-dimensional sonographic examinations were performed involving 35 pregnant women from 12 to 38 weeks of gestation. The fetal gastric volume was monitored every 5 min for a minimum of 40 min (40-60 min) in each woman. The rotational technique with Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis (VOCAL) was used to calculate the fetal gastric volume. Maximum and minimum gastric volumes were curvilinearly associated with the gestational age, respectively (R(2) = 0.611, p < 0.0001, and R(2) = 0.407, p < 0.0001, respectively). A curvilinear relationship was noted between the functional capacity (maximum volume - minimum volume) of the fetal stomach and gestational age (R(2) = 0.531, p < 0.0001). The maximum volume change [(maximum volume - minimum volume/maximum volume) × 100] did not change during pregnancy (mean and standard deviation, 64.1% ± 16.1%). However, gastric emptying cycles could not be determined in this study because of the short observation period and small number of subjects. Our findings suggest that the fetal gastric volume calculated by conventional two-dimensional ultrasound in previous investigations is approximately one-third of the maximum volume using 3-D ultrasound in the present study and that 3-D ultrasound is a superior means of evaluating the fetal gastric volume in utero. However, the data and their interpretation in the present study should be viewed with some degree of caution because of the small number of subjects. Further studies involving a larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings."

CD011126,0,18561642,0,"4D laser camera for accurate patient positioning, collision avoidance, image fusion and adaptive approaches during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.","A four-dimensional (4D) laser camera (LC) has been developed for accurate patient imaging in diagnostic and therapeutic radiology. A complementary metal-oxide semiconductor camera images the intersection of a scanned fan shaped laser beam with the surface of the patient and allows real time recording of movements in a three-dimensional (3D) or four-dimensional (4D) format (3D +time). The LC system was first designed as an accurate patient setup tool during diagnostic and therapeutic applications but was found to be of much wider applicability as a general 4D photon ""tag"" for the surface of the patient in different clinical procedures. It is presently used as a 3D or 4D optical benchmark or tag for accurate delineation of the patient surface as demonstrated for patient auto setup, breathing and heart motion detection. Furthermore, its future potential applications in gating, adaptive therapy, 3D or 4D image fusion between most imaging modalities and image processing are discussed. It is shown that the LC system has a geometrical resolution of about 0, 1 mm and that the rigid body repositioning accuracy is about 0, 5 mm below 20 mm displacements, 1 mm below 40 mm and better than 2 mm at 70 mm. This indicates a slight need for repeated repositioning when the initial error is larger than about 50 mm. The positioning accuracy with standard patient setup procedures for prostate cancer at Karolinska was found to be about 5-6 mm when independently measured using the LC system. The system was found valuable for positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) in vivo tumor and dose delivery imaging where it potentially may allow effective correction for breathing artifacts in 4D PET-CT and image fusion with lymph node atlases for accurate target volume definition in oncology. With a LC system in all imaging and radiation therapy rooms, auto setup during repeated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures may save around 5 min per session, increase accuracy and allow efficient image fusion between all imaging modalities employed."

CD011126,0,23584879,0,Self administered screening for hereditary cancers in conjunction with mammography and ultrasound.,"We evaluated the feasibility of an automated tablet computer application providing a family and personal history based cancer risk assessment for hereditary breast, ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancers. 1,002 women presenting for screening mammography and 1,000 presenting for ultrasound were offered screening. The application calculated the risk of BRCA mutations using BRCAPRO, Myriad and Tyrer-Cuzick risk assessment models. Lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer was assessed with the BRCAPRO, Claus and Tyrer-Cuzick models. Colorectal and endometrial cancer risk was calculated via the MMRpro model. Patients were identified as high-risk based on thresholds 10% or greater risk for carrying genetic mutations or 20% or greater lifetime risk of breast or ovarian cancer. The percent of women found to be high-risk by a single risk assessment tool ranged from 0.5 to 5.3%. Combining assessment tools found 9.3% of women to be high-risk. The risk assessments performed similarly for the mammography and ultrasound cohorts with yields (combining assessment tools) of 9.2 and 9.4% respectively. The average ages of all the high-risk women were 45.8 and 39.6 years for the mammography and ultrasound cohorts respectively. Difficulties encountered included a need for software upgrade, wireless network unreliability and hardware theft. Automated family history screening can identify women probably at high-risk for hereditary cancers efficiently. The number of women identified is increased by employing multiple risk assessment models simultaneously. Surveying women in conjunction with ultrasound identified women at increased risk as effectively and at a younger age than with screening mammography."

CD011126,0,22322968,0,The peritoneal tumour microenvironment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) disseminates early and extensively throughout the peritoneal space, causing multiple lesions that are a major clinical problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular composition of peritoneal tumour deposits in patient biopsies and their evolution in mouse models using immunohistochemistry, intravital microscopy, confocal microscopy, and 3D modelling. Tumour deposits from the omentum of HGSC patients contained a prominent leukocyte infiltrate of CD3(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages, with occasional neutrophils. Alpha-smooth muscle actin(+) (α-SMA(+) ) pericytes and/or fibroblasts surrounded these well-vascularized tumour deposits. Using the murine bowel mesentery as an accessible mouse peritoneal tissue that could be easily imaged, and two different transplantable models, we found multiple microscopic tumour deposits after i.p. injection of malignant cells. Attachment to the peritoneal surface was rapid (6-48 h) with an extensive CD45(+) leukocyte infiltrate visible by 48 h. This infiltrate persisted until end point and in the syngeneic murine ID8 model, it primarily consisted of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and CD68(+) macrophages with α-SMA(+) cells also involved from the earliest stages. A majority of tumour deposits developed above existing mesenteric blood vessels, but in avascular spaces new blood vessels tracked towards the tumour deposits by 2-3 weeks in the IGROV-1 xenografts and 6 weeks in the ID8 syngeneic model; a vigorous convoluted blood supply was established by end point. Inhibition of tumour cell cytokine production by stable expression of shRNA to CXCR4 in IGROV-1 cells did not influence the attachment of cells to the mesentery but delayed neovascularization and reduced tumour deposit size. We conclude that the multiple peritoneal tumour deposits found in HGSC patients can be modelled in the mouse. The techniques described here may be useful for assessing treatments that target the disseminated stage of this disease."

The aim of this study was to describe epididymal microlithiasis in 22 previously dialysed patients who received kidney transplantations at a median age of 19 years (range 9-30). The patients underwent scrotum ultrasonography, semen analysis and laboratory tests (renal function, sexual hormones, Ca, P and PTH) and were administered the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire. Seventeen presented calcifications of the epididymis, two of whom had concomitant testicular calcifications; a further three patients had isolated testicular calcifications without epididymis involvement. It was not possible to investigate the fertility of all of the patients but 12 of the 13 whose semen was analysed showed abnormalities: five were azoospermic and seven oligospermic with various degrees of morphological anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first published data concerning the prevalence of epididymal calcifications in young dialysed patients undergoing renal transplantation.

CD011126,0,15856517,0,Diagnosis of early intramural ectopic pregnancy.,"Intramural ectopic pregnancy is a very rare diagnosis. Establishing a diagnosis is difficult and is often made intraoperatively. Demonstration of a live extrauterine gestation is the only specific sign of such a pregnancy. A small number of ectopic pregnancies are interstitial or cornual pregnancies. Rupture of an intramural ectopic pregnancy is a serious clinical complication. Diagnosis of this ectopic pregnancy can sometimes be made using 2-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), but it may also require 3-dimensional TVS. We present the case of a 25-year-old gravida 0, para 0 woman with amenorrhea lasting 6(+5) weeks. Previous surgery included a right adnexectomy for torsion of a right dermoid cyst. The patient's serum hCG was elevated. TVS provided a detailed view of the endometrial cavity. The results of 2-dimensional TVS suggested the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. The sonogram showed a gestational sac with an embryonic pole and a yolk sac, which was separated from the endometrium. Use of 3-dimensional TVS demonstrated a live embryo in a gestational sac surrounded by myometrium below the right cornu lying outside the endometrium. This finding was confirmed by laparotomy and the conceptus was excised. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged 7 days after surgery. In our case, the previous adnexectomy was an identifiable risk factor. Nonetheless, making a diagnosis of an intramural pregnancy was challenging. Suspicion may arise when sonography has revealed an intramural gestational sac."

CD011126,0,22775335,0,Ovarian tumor characterization using 3D ultrasound.,"Among gynecological malignancies, ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of death. Preoperative determination of whether a tumor is benign or malignant has often been found to be difficult. Because of such inconclusive findings from ultrasound images and other tests, many patients with benign conditions have been offered unnecessary surgeries thereby increasing patient anxiety and healthcare cost. The key objective of our work is to develop an adjunct Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique that uses ultrasound images of the ovary and image mining algorithms to accurately classify benign and malignant ovarian tumor images. In this algorithm, we extract texture features based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Laws Texture Energy (LTE) and use them to build and train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Our technique was validated using 1000 benign and 1000 malignant images, and we obtained a high accuracy of 99.9% using a SVM classifier with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The high accuracy can be attributed to the determination of the novel combination of the 16 texture based features that quantify the subtle changes in the images belonging to both classes. The proposed algorithm has the following characteristics: cost-effectiveness, complete automation, easy deployment, and good end-user comprehensibility. We have also developed a novel integrated index, Ovarian Cancer Index (OCI), which is a combination of the texture features, to present the physicians with a more transparent adjunct technique for ovarian tumor classification."

In this retrospective study, ovarian cysts over 30 mm in diameter were detected in 90 women. Of this population, 75 were premenopausal, 13 postmenopausal, and two had undergone a hysterectomy. Thirteen women presented acutely. Family history of breast, ovary or colon cancer was not ascertained in any of the women. None had CA125 levels performed. In 22 cases, the cyst was aspirated; only 10 of these had follow-up ultrasound. Laparotomy was performed in 25 premenopausal women, the two perimenopausal women and eight postmenopausal women.

However, because of inconsistent results and methodologic flaws of anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) as a marker of ovarian reserve, antral follicle count may be a more accurate noninvasive marker than AMH. Evaluating ovarian reserve using antral follicle count rather than AMH may yield different conclusions insofar as postsurgical damage to the ovary.

Women were equally divided into three groups. Group I included women who responded to clomiphene citrate. Women enrolled in groups II and III were subjected to either unilateral or bilateral ovarian drilling, respectively. Ovarian reserve testing was performed once before and three months after treatment. Basal serum inhibin B level showed a significant decrease after bilateral drilling compared with predrilling level (53.8 +/- 13.5 vs 46.3 +/- 6.2 pg/mL; P= 0.031).

CD011126,0,17946082,0,Deformable registration of prone and supine colons for CT colonography.,"CT colonography (CTC) is a non-invasive technique for detecting colorectal polyps and colon cancer. Through the addition of the prone scanning with the original supine scanning, the possibility of detecting the polyps is increased. The registration process for this application requires the comparison between the prone and supine colons for diagnosis. A level-set representation of the object boundary using a distance map is presented in this paper as an input to demons registration algorithm for supine and prone CT colonography image data. After first aligning the colon volumes based on the patient's anus position, distances inside and outside the objects' boundary are computed. The level-set from the distance map allows the demons algorithm to decide the moving direction for the initial demons' force between the two colons. We present a result with a 3 dimensional volume of a patient's colon. The results suggest that our method has excellent registration performance with high confidence even with considerable deformation of the colon lumen in 3 dimensional case."

Of 481 postmenopausal women who presented with endometrial polyps at diagnostic hysteroscopy between 2004 and 2007, 48.9% were asymptomatic and 51.1% had postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed abnormal endometrial thickness in 60.0% vs. 57.7%, polyps in 37.9% vs. 32.9%, endometrial tumors in 1.3% vs. 0.8%, and submucosal myomas in 0.9% vs. 2.0% by the absence or presence of bleeding. Around three-fourth of the polyps were removed. Histopathologic diagnoses showed mucous polyps in 93.7 of asymptomatic women compared to 80.7% of those with bleeding, while endometrial tumors were only seen in those bleeding (7.2%).

CD011126,0,8706964,0,Ovarian cysts.,"The Author intends to compare the data available in literature on the topic of 'laparoscopic surgery of ovarian cysts' to his case material. From 1985 to 1994, the author carried out 920 laparoscopic operations for the removal of ovarian cysts. Of these, 13 were converted to laparotomies, mostly because of peri-adnexal adhesions. There were 22 recurrences (endometriosic and mucinous multilocular cysts), and five severe complications (two purulent inflammations, one intra-operative haemorrhage and one post-operative one, one post-operative acute abdomen sine causa). In one case, an unrecognised endometrioid carcinoma was inadequately treated with laparoscopy. The author considers laparoscopy as the elective choice for surgical treatment of ovarian cysts. Suspect malignancy is not a contra-indication to laparoscopic surgery, since the removal of the operative specimen and its subsequent histological examination can be effected-in the large majority of cases-with the same results both laparoscopically and laparotomically. There is a problem with undiagnosed carcinomas in fertile females, but it is equally present in laparotomy."

CD011126,0,25515794,0,MRI appearances of pure epithelial papillary serous borderline ovarian tumours.,"Borderline epithelial ovarian tumours (BOT) represent 15-20% of all non-benign ovarian epithelial neoplasms. Compared to malignant ovarian tumours, they usually present at a younger age and carry a far superior prognosis. Fertility-conserving surgery is an important treatment option for patients with BOT. Ultrasound and CT are both widely available and play roles in the initial investigation and staging of BOT, respectively. However, lack of soft-tissue contrast limits their ability to characterize BOT. MRI can facilitate recognition of pure epithelial serous BOT (SBOT), including the cystic papillary and surface papillary subtypes. An abundance of hyperintense papillary projections with low signal internal branching and ovarian stroma preservation with a hypointense ovarian capsular margin on T2-weighted imaging are features strongly suggestive of SBOT. In this review we will discuss the general morphological features of SBOT, the benefits and drawbacks of ultrasound and CT in the initial work-up, and the principal MRI features enabling recognition of surface papillary and cystic papillary SBOT."

In early gestation, significant correlations were found among gestational age, crown-rump length, diameter of yolk sac and fetal heart rate. The maximal length of the gestational sac did not correlate with any other parameter. Transvaginal image quality was better in 76.2% in obstetric field and in 66.7% in gynecologic field, as compared to findings with conventional abdominal ultrasonography, respectively. Fine structures and individual organs were better evidenced transvaginally. Therefore, transvaginal ultrasound affords pertinent information complementary to that obtained with the transabdominal technique."

The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of the ultrasound technique were evaluated using the surgical findings as 'gold standard'. In 631 patients (89.5%) the ultrasound examination established a correct diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of the ultrasound examination varied between 75-95.3% and 93.3-100%, respectively. The positive predictive value was found between 89.7 and 100%, while the false sonographic results were 10.4%, which included those of ectopic pregnancies. It is thus concluded that ultrasonography as compared to the surgical findings has proved to be of great value in establishing a gynecological diagnosis."

CD011126,0,23817917,0,Association of age at menarche with increasing number of fibroids in a cohort of women who underwent standardized ultrasound assessment.,"Age at menarche has been associated with several reproductive conditions, and frequencies differ by race. Racial disparities also impact fibroid risk. We comprehensively examined the relationship between age at menarche, fibroid characteristics, and race. Women were enrolled in Right From the Start (2001-2010), a multistate study that systematically screened for fibroids during very early pregnancy. Endovaginal ultrasounds were conducted, and fibroid presence, number, type, volume, and diameter were recorded according to standardized definitions. Generalized estimating equations adjusted for correlations within study site were used to estimate associations between age at menarche and fibroid status and to test for interactions with race. Of 5,023 participants, 11% had a fibroid. Seven percent underwent menarche before 11 years of age and 11% at 15 years or later. We did not observe interactions between age at menarche and race. A 1-year increase in age at menarche was inversely associated with fibroids (adjusted risk ratio = 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.82, 0.91). Early age at menarche had a similar positive association in individual analyses with fibroid size, type, and location but was stronger for multiple fibroids (adjusted risk ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.68, 0.83). Our findings confirm other reports of an association between age at menarche and fibroid development (regardless of characteristics), demonstrate no effect modification by race, and suggest a stronger association for women with multiple fibroids, possibly reflecting a stronger association for early-onset disease."

After hysterectomy with presumed benign disease, a histologic diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was made in 7 patients (0.37%). Preoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was not made in any of the 7 patients. However, serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were abnormally elevated in 3 of them, and degenerative changes were found within the tumor by ultrasonography in 5 of them. Furthermore, increased lactate dehydrogenase levels and degenerative changes within the tumor were found in 3 of the patients whose tumors had 10 or more mitoses per 10 high-power fields. The prognosis for the leiomyosarcomas with increased mitotic rates is very poor. Therefore, a degenerative change within the uterine mass and an increased lactate dehydrogenase level, when present, should suggest the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma."

Study subjects were 101 women with monoamniotic twins who were registered with the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology Successive Pregnancy Birth Registry System and who had given birth at ≥22 weeks of gestation during 2002-2009. The gestational week at delivery (mean±SD) was 31.8±3.7. Fourteen women experienced intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). Short-term outcomes of co-twins born to the 14 women included 8 IUFDs, one early neonatal death within 7 days of life (END), and 5 survivors. Four other women experienced 5 ENDs. Thus, 13.9% (28/202) of infants died perinatally (22 IUFDs and 6 ENDs), 13.9% (14/101) of women experienced IUFD, and 82.2% (83/101) of women experienced neither IUFD nor END. Structural anomalies and twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome explained 17.9% (five infants) and 10.7% (three infants) of the 28 perinatal deaths, respectively. The prospective risk of IUFD was 13.9% (14/101) for women who reached gestational week 22(-0/7), gradually decreasing thereafter but remaining at between 4.5% and 8.0% between gestational week 30(-0/7) and 36(-0/7)."

Case report with ultrasonographic preoperative diagnosis.,"Inguinal endometriosis is rare and accounts for 0.3-0.6% of patients affected by endometriosis. A correct preoperative diagnosis is rare. Diagnosis is frequently made by histologic examination. A 36-year-old nulliparous woman presented with a painful mass in her right groin of 2 years duration. The pain fluctuated according to the menstrual period. Physical examination revealed an elastic hard mobile mass measuring 2 x 2 cm in the right inguinal region. Ultrasound examination confirmed a hypoechoic tumor in the right inguinal region with poorly defined boundaries and perilesional and intralesional vascular flow suspect for endometriosis. Wide excision of the lump with a part of the round ligament was carried out. Histology showed endometrial glands and stroma within the fibrous tissue. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged the next day. After surgery, the pain disappeared completely. No signs of recurrence occurred at approximately 16 months after the surgery. Although rare, extrapelvic endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in women of reproductive age presenting with an inguinal mass, especially if the groin mass is associated in size and tenderness with menstrual variability.

First, Gd2O3:Yb/Er assembled mesoporous silica with 2D hexagonal (MCM-41) and 3D cubic (MCM-48) network have been prepared via a one-step procedure. Then, gold nanocrystals with diameter of 5 nm are integrated with the amino group functionalized nanocomposites. Upon 980 nm near infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, a wavelength-dependent enhancement of the UC intensities is observed due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of attached gold nanoparticles. These composites have good biocompatibility and sustained anticancer drug (doxorubicin, DOX) release properties, making it a promising candidate for drug delivery. Particularly, under 980 nm NIR laser irradiation, the green UC emission overlaps the SPR band of gold nanocrystals, which causes a photothermal effect of gold nanocrystals and induces a rapid DOX release from the Au hybrid materials. This DOX loaded multifunctional system has an obvious cytotoxic effect and photothermally killing enhanced effect on SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells.

CD011126,0,22898699,0,3-T MR-guided brachytherapy for gynecologic malignancies.,"Gynecologic malignancies are a leading cause of death in women worldwide. Standard treatment for many primary and recurrent gynecologic cancer cases includes external-beam radiation followed by brachytherapy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is beneficial in diagnostic evaluation, in mapping the tumor location to tailor radiation dose and in monitoring the tumor response to treatment. Initial studies of MR guidance in gynecologic brachytherapy demonstrate the ability to optimize tumor coverage and reduce radiation dose to normal tissues, resulting in improved outcomes for patients. In this article, we describe a methodology to aid applicator placement and treatment planning for 3 Tesla (3-T) MR-guided brachytherapy that was developed specifically for gynecologic cancers. This methodology has been used in 18 cases from September 2011 to May 2012 in the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite at Brigham and Women's Hospital. AMIGO comprises state-of-the-art tools for MR imaging, image analysis and treatment planning. An MR sequence using three-dimensional (3D)-balanced steady-state free precession in a 3-T MR scanner was identified as the best sequence for catheter identification with ballooning artifact at the tip. 3D treatment planning was performed using MR images. Items in development include software designed to support virtual needle trajectory planning that uses probabilistic bias correction, graph-based segmentation and image registration algorithms. The results demonstrate that 3-T MR image guidance has a role in gynecologic brachytherapy. These novel developments have the potential to improve targeted treatment to the tumor while sparing the normal tissues."

CD011126,0,2227610,0,Transvaginal ultrasound is an effective method for screening in polycystic ovarian disease: preliminary study.,"To assess the usefulness of transvaginal ultrasound scanning (TVS) for screening in polycystic ovarian (PCO) disease, we symptomatically and endocrinologically compared 9 cases (group A) with PCO noted by transabdominal ultrasound scanning (TAS) with 8 cases (group B) with PCO noted by TVS only. No difference in the mean value of LH/FSH ratio, E1/E2 ratio and testosterone was observed between the two groups. However, the frequency of endocrine abnormalities, menstrual disorders and hypertrichosis in group A was significantly more than in group B. Therefore, we suggest that the stage of PCO noted by TAS is more progressive than that noted by TVS only and TVS is useful for screening of PCO disease."
CD011126,0,2227612,0,Treatment of large fibroids with high doses of gestrinone.,"Twenty-four women with large, myomatous uteri, measuring between 218.7 and 2,920 cm3 were treated with gestrinone, a tri-enic steroid with antiestrogen and antiprogesterone properties. In order to saturate the receptors of the large myomata, the doses used to treat these women were twice the recommended dosage of 2.5 mg, 3 times weekly, used to treat smaller tumors. The treatment lasted 6 months to 1 year. In all cases there was a reduction in uterine volume. In the 24 patients, the mean uterine volume of 724.9 cm3 on admission decreased to 450.73 cm3 at 6 months. For 14 patients treated for a full year, the mean uterine volume of 689.73 cm3 decreased to 329.22 cm3. Menstruation was suppressed in all patients by the end of the 2nd month of treatment. Episodic bleeding occurred in 6 patients but in only 1 did this last longer than 1 week. Other symptoms such as pelvic discomfort and dysuria disappeared or were significantly alleviated by the 2nd month of treatment. Side effects included seborrhea, acne, nervousness, myalgia and arthraglia, hoarseness and mild hirsutism but all these symptoms were promptly reversed following discontinuation. The mean increase in weight was 3.4 kg in 6 months. No menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and depression developed during this trial. Six patients complained of excessive sweating.

The pressure and flow induced by the liquid are crucial tools for he gynecologists during surgery to obtain a clear view of the operation site. This paper presents two different aspects of hydrometra simulation, namely the distension of the uterine muscle and the liquid flow simulation in the cavity. The deformation of the organ's shape is computed offline based on finite element calculations whereas the flow is approximated on the fly by solving the simplified Navier-Stokes equations. The real-time capabilities of the presented algorithms as well as the level of fidelity achieved by the proposed methods are discussed."

Ninety-seven consecutive women with PCOS were included in the study after assessment of gynecological and obesity history and careful clinical examination. Women were divided into three tertile groups based on the waist to hip ratio (WHR). Those with peripheral body fat distribution (P-BFD) had a WHR of less than 0.80, those with intermediate body fat distribution (I-BFD) had a WHR of 0.81 to 0.90, and those with abdominal body fat distribution (A-BFD) had a WHR exceeding 0.90. Baseline blood and urine samples were obtained for several hormone and lipid determinations, and the response of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide to a glucose oral challenge (75 g) was investigated. In the PCOS group, WHR values were higher than those used to define P-BFD and A-BFD in the normal female population. As WHR values increased, a significantly greater prevalence of obesity and acanthosis nigricans and a lower prevalence of acne was present. No significant differences were present in any of the other clinical features between the three groups. Ovarian morphology and volumes were similar in all groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011126,0,21118042,0,Uterine cavity assessment prior to IVF.,"Approximately 15% of couples are affected with subfertility, of which up to 20% remain unexplained. Uterine cavity abnormalities can be a contributing cause of subfertility and recurrent implantation failure. Uterine cavity assessment has been suggested as a routine investigation in the evaluation of subfertile women. Traditionally, hysterosalpingography has been the most commonly used technique in the evaluation of infertility. Transvaginal ultrasound scan allows visualization of the endometrial lining and cavity, and has been used as a screening test for the assessment of uterine cavity. Abnormal uterine findings on a baseline scan can be further evaluated with saline hysterosonography, which is highly sensitive and specific in identifying intrauterine abnormalities. Hysteroscopy is considered as the definitive diagnostic tool to evaluate any abnormality suspected on hysterosalpingography, transvaginal ultrasound scan or saline hysterosonography during routine investigation of infertile patients. Minimally invasive hysteroscopes have minimized the pain experienced by patients during the procedure and made it feasible to use hysteroscopy as a routine outpatient examination. Following recurrent IVF failure there is some evidence of benefit from hysteroscopy in increasing the chance of pregnancy in the subsequent IVF cycle, both in those with abnormal and normal hysteroscopic findings. Various possible mechanisms have been proposed for this beneficial effect, but more randomized controlled trials are needed before its routine use in the general subfertile population can be recommended."
CD011126,0,21224170,0,Registration under topological change for CT colonography.,"Computed tomography (CT) colonography is a minimally invasive screening technique for colorectal polyps, in which X-ray CT images of the distended colon are acquired, usually in the prone and supine positions of a single patient. Registration of segmented colon images from both positions will be useful for computer-assisted polyp detection. We have previously presented algorithms for registration of the prone and supine colons when both are well distended and there is a single connected lumen. However, due to inadequate bowel preparation or peristalsis, there may be collapsed segments in one or both of the colon images resulting in a topological change in the images. Such changes make deformable registration of the colon images difficult, and at present, there are no registration algorithms that can accommodate them. In this paper, we present an algorithm that can perform volume registration of prone/supine colon images in the presence of a topological change. For this purpose, 3-D volume images are embedded as a manifold in a 4-D space, and the manifold is evolved for nonrigid registration. Experiments using data from 24 patients show that the proposed method achieves good registration results in both the shape alignment of topologically different colon images from a single patient and the polyp location estimation between supine and prone colon images."

CD011126,0,21419328,0,Ultrasound for pelvic pain II: nongynecologic causes.,"Acute pelvic pain in women is a common presenting complaint that can result from various conditions. Because these conditions can be of gynecologic or nongynecologic origin, they may pose a challenge to the diagnostic acumen of physicians, including radiologists. A thorough workup should include clinical history, physical examination, laboratory data, and appropriate imaging studies, all of which should be available to the radiologist for evaluation. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality in women with acute pelvic pain because of its high sensitivity, low cost, wide availability, and lack of ionizing radiation, particularly when a gynecologic disorder is suspected as the underlying cause. However, other modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be very helpful, especially when a nongynecologic condition is suspected."

CD011126,0,25811892,0,Compatibility of a novel thrombospondin-1 analog with fertility and pregnancy in a xenograft mouse model of endometriosis.,"Endometriosis is a gynecological disease defined by the growth of endometrium outside of the uterus. Although endometriosis contributes to 50% of female infertility cases, medical treatments are incompatible with pregnancy. Angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels from existing vasculature, plays a crucial role in endometriotic lesion growth and survival. Previously, we demonstrated the effectiveness of thrombospondin-1 analog, ABT-898 (Abbott Laboratories) to inhibit endometriotic lesion vascularization in mice. We have now evaluated the trans-generational implications of ABT-898 treatment before and during mouse pregnancy. We hypothesized that ABT-898 would target lesion vasculature without affecting pregnancy, offspring development, or ovarian and uterine vascularity in mice. Endometriosis was induced using human endometrium in β-estradiol-primed BALB/c-Rag-2-/-Il2rγ-/- mice receiving intraperitoneal injections of ABT-898 (25 mg/kg) or 5% dextrose control for 21 days. Ultrasound assessment of lesion vascularization revealed a reduction in blood flow supplying treated lesions. Excised ABT-898 treated lesions stained for CD31+ endothelial cells exhibited a decrease in microvessel density. Following confirmation of estrous cycling, mice were bred and treated with ABT-898 on gestation days 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. ABT-898 did not affect estrous cycling or pregnancy parameters including litter size across generations and offspring weight gain. Quantification of angiogenic cytokine plasma levels revealed no significant differences between treatment groups. Vimentin staining of the uterus and ovary revealed no observable effects of ABT-898. Similarly, no obvious histological anomalies were observed in the kidney, liver, ovary, or uterus following ABT-898 treatment. These results suggest that ABT-898 effectively inhibit endometriotic lesion vascularization without affecting trans-generational pregnancy outcomes in mice."

CD011126,0,15018168,0,Diverticular disease in CT colonography.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate findings on CT colonography (CTC) in patients with diverticular disease. In a retrospective analysis of 160 consecutive patients, who underwent CTC and conventional colonoscopy (CC), patients with diverticular disease were retrieved. The CTC images were compared with CC and, if possible, with pathology. Findings on both 2D and 3D images are illustrated with emphasis on diagnostic problems and the possible solutions to overcome these problems. Several aspects of diverticulosis were detected: prediverticulosis (3%); global (55.6%); and focal wall thickening (4%) caused by thickened haustral folds, fibrosis, inflammation and adenocarcinoma; diverticula (52%); pseudopolypoid lesions caused by diverticular fecaliths (39%); inverted diverticula (1.2%); and mucosal prolapse (0.6%). Solutions to overcome pitfalls are described as abdominal windowing, content of the pseudopolypoid lesion, comparison of 2D and 3D images, prone-supine imaging and the aspect of the pericolic fat. In this series there were equivocal findings in case of mucosal prolapse (0.6%) and focal wall thickening (4%). Diverticulosis is a challenge for CTC to avoid false-positive diagnosis of polypoid and tumoral disease. Knowledge of possible false causes of polypoid disease and comparison of 2D and 3D images are necessary to avoid false-positive diagnosis. In case of equivocal findings additional conventional colonoscopy should be advised whenever a clinically significant lesion (> or = 1 cm) is suspected."
CD011126,0,26411233,0,A case of idiopathic intracranial hypertension associated with PCOS.,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare neurologic disorder. It is also known as pseudotumor cerebri. The incidence of IIH is one to two per 100,000 population annually. The higher incidence is in obese women from 15 to 44 years. The main symptoms are headache and visual loss. It mostly affects women of childbearing age who are overweight or obese. There are many theories of pathogenesis of IIH, but precise pathogenesis is unknown. One of the causes of IIH is intracranial venous sinus thrombosis. It can cause increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure by obstruction of venous outflow and blocking of CSF absorption. In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients, thrombogenic tendency is increased due to increased aromatization of testosterone to estradiol which could induce estrogen-mediated thrombophilia. The authors present a 14-year-old girl with PCOS stigma who presented with a severe headache and papilledema. These symptoms were not improved by standard medical therapy of IIH and PCOS, but improved after laparoscopic ovarian drilling. The authors report it with a review of the literature."

This was a prospective study of the first 100 consecutive women presenting with infertility to the authors at Mbanefo Hospital and Hansa Clinics, both in Enugu, South-East geopolitical zone of Nigeria from 1 May 2005 to 20 January 2006. Saline sonohysterosalpingography was carried out in the standard way in these women. The findings were analysed using simple percentages and means +/- SD. The procedure was completed in 98 women, while in two others it was not possible to cannulate the uterine cavity. A total of 61 of the women had normal uterine musculature, 37 had interstitial fibroids and two had sonographic features of adenomyosis. Regarding the endometrial cavity, 93 women had a normal endometrium, four had a submucosal fibroid, one had intrauterine adhesions, while the endometrial cavity could not be assessed in two women who could not be cannulated. No case of submucosal polyp or uterine septa or other congenital uterine anomalies was seen. As assessed sonologically, 77 of the study subjects had bilateral patent tubes, while five had unilateral tubal patency. In one woman, there was uncertainty about tubal patency or blockage; in two women, the tubes could not be assessed because of non-cannulation of the uterine cavity and in 15 women, both tubes were blocked. A total of 74 women had normal ovaries; 15 had polycystic ovaries; five had atrophic ovaries consistent with ovarian failure and six women had ovarian cysts. In 18 women, the findings at sonosalpingography (SSG) were confirmed at laparoscopy in 11 women or laparotomy (two women) or by the fact that the patients became pregnant (five women). In 15 (83.3%) of these 18 women, the findings at SSG and laparotomy/laparoscopy or of the woman becoming pregnant were compatible. SSG is a useful screening test for assessing endometrial, tubal and ovarian factors in infertile Nigerian women, thereby obviating the need for laparoscopy and hysteroscopy in the majority of cases."

Seventy-one cases of threatened spontaneous abortion (group A) and 71 asymptomatic controls (group B), matched for gestational and maternal age, body mass index and smoking status, were included. Maternal serum samples were evaluated for HCG, progesterone, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and HSCRP using standard bio-assays. No difference was observed in ultrasound measurements, and median progesterone maternal serum level was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in group A compared with group B. In group A, the median of all ultrasound and maternal serum parameters was significantly lower (P < 0.01) compared with group B. The median gestational sac diameter, volume and median HSCRP and PAPP-A levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in group A, with a normal outcome compared with group B, probably owing to the inflammatory reaction associated with intrauterine bleeding. In group A patients destined to abortion, the gestational sac development and corresponding protein synthesis fell before the fetal heart activity stopped; in spontaneous pregnancies, maternal serum HSCRP did not provide additional information for the management of threatened spontaneous abortion but warrants further research in assisted reproduction pregnancies."

CD011126,0,17582974,0,Role of transrectal ultrasonography in evaluting azoospermia causes.,"Infertility is a term with which we define lack of pregnancy among sexual partners within one year of regular intercourses without use of contraceptives. The term primary infertility includes lack of any previous pregnancy, while secondary infertility is a current infertility with previous successful pregnancy. Azoospermia is an inability to produce spermatozoids in testicles or represents normal production of the spermatozoids but the obstacle is somewhere in the ejaculatory paths. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) provides us with the quality and most reliable data about the urinary bladder, prostate gland. Seminiferous tubule and ejaculatory ducts. The goal of this paper is to determine the role of TRUS in patients with azoospermia, in one significant sample of infertile respondents. During 2005 and 2006, among 35 patients with verified azoospermia, and which were involved in determination of infertility cause, also TRUS was performed as a mode of ultrasound diagnostic procedure. Average age of the patients was 35 years. Evaluation is done with use of ultrasound equipment HDI 4000-PHILIPS, with Color Doppler equipped with the transrectal ,biplane"" probe of high frequency 9.5 MHz. There was 10 (29%) normal findings (29%), and 25 (71%) pathological. Also there was 8 (23%) dilatated vesicles, 6 (17%) wide ejaculatory ducts, 5 (13%) calcifications in vesicles. Atrophy and hypotrophy of vesicles was present in 3 (9%) cases and 3 (9%) central prostate cysts.

Twenty premenopausal women with menorrhagia attributed to uterine fibroids received Depo Provera (150 mg/month) for 6 months. Control of bleeding was assessed by menstrual diary, haematologic parameters (Hb) and uterine and fibroid size measured sonargraphically. Following a period of 6 months after the initiation of Depo Provera, 30% became amenorrhoeic, 70% noticed improvement in their bleeding pattern and 15% had an increase in their haemoglobin levels. The mean uterine and fibroid volume was also reduced by 48% and 33%, respectively. Medical therapy with Depo Provera with symptomatic fibroids causes significant improvement in bleeding pattern as well as a reduction in fibroid volume."

This study has taken the number of mature oocytes at the moment of egg retrieval as its primary end variable. After adjustment for age, gravidity, antagonist protocol, AMH and infertility diagnosis, the average difference in number of mature oocytes between the UHM group and the UM group was -0.4 (95% CI: -1.7 to 1.0), which met our definition of clinical equivalence (95% CI for the adjusted mean difference between -2 and 2).

CD011126,0,17504316,0,Uterine artery embolization for symptomatic fibroids with imaging follow up.,"The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of uterine artery embolization (UAE) as a primary treatment method in treatment of symptomatic fibroids, whether there are any preembolization MRI characteristics of fibroid predictive of reduction in volume and assess reduction in uterine and dominant fibroid volumes using ultrasound (US) and MRI. Study was carried out in total of 32 patients aged 25-49 years (mean 40.9 years). Uterine and dominant fibroid volume were determined using US and MRI before UAE, MRI and US at 3 months and US alone at 6 and 12 months post-UAE, supplemented by clinical evaluation at interval of 3, 6 and 12 months. Procedure was carried out through unilateral femoral puncture using poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) particles 355-500 microm in size. All 32 patients had successful procedures. Overall, 25 patients responded, giving a clinical success rate of 78.12%. Mean reduction in volume of uterus and fibroid was 33 and 59.7% and 48.9 and 75.5% on US at 3 and 12 months respectively, and 33.3 and 58.6% on MRI at 3 months. Volume reduction on US and MRI at 3 months was highly correlative. There was no statistical difference in size reduction in volume of fibroids, which were hypointense or hyperintense on T2-weighted image (T2WI) on pre-UAE MRI. Uterine artery embolization leads to good technical success and fibroid volume reduction. Ultrasound alone may be used for follow up of patients post-UAE. Preprocedure signal characteristics on T2WI are not predictors of volume reduction after UAE."

CD011126,0,23693160,0,Menstrual pain is associated with rapid structural alterations in the brain.,"Dysmenorrhea is the most prevalent gynecological disorder in women of child-bearing age. Dysmenorrhea is associated with central sensitization and functional and structural changes in the brain. Our recent brain morphometry study disclosed that dysmenorrhea is associated with trait-related abnormal gray matter (GM) changes, even in the absence of menstrual pain, indicating that the adolescent brain is vulnerable to menstrual pain. Here we report rapid state-related brain morphological changes, ie, between pain and pain-free states, in dysmenorrhea. We used T1-weighted anatomic magnetic resonance imaging to investigate regional GM volume changes between menstruation and periovulatory phases in 32 dysmenorrhea subjects and 32 age- and menstrual cycle-matched asymptomatic controls. An optimized voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted to disclose the possible state-related regional GM volume changes across different menstrual phases. A correlation analysis was also conducted between GM differences and the current menstrual pain experience in the dysmenorrhea group. Compared with the periovulatory phase, the dysmenorrhea subjects revealed greater hypertrophic GM changes than controls during the menstruation phase in regions involved in pain modulation, generation of the affective experience, and regulation of endocrine function, whereas atrophic GM changes were found in regions associated with pain transmission. Volume changes in regions involved in the regulation of endocrine function and pain transmission correlated with the menstrual pain experience scores. Our results demonstrated that short-lasting cyclic menstrual pain is associated not only with trait-related but also rapid state-related structural alterations in the brain. Considering the high prevalence rate of menstrual pain, these findings mandate a great demand to revisit dysmenorrhea with regard to its impact on the brain and other clinical pain conditions."

Retrospective data collection from consecutive weekly multidisciplinary team meetings over a 12-month period. All patients had undergone ultrasound examination before surgery. Data included patient demographics, menopausal status, indications for ultrasound, type of practitioner carrying out the scan, operative findings and final histopathological diagnosis. Ultrasound imaging appearances were correlated to histology. Of the 47 cases of uterine malignancy, 45 had endometrial carcinoma. All had either a thickened or poorly seen or not seen endometrium. Twenty-four per cent of these women were premenopausal. Forty-seven of the 48 cases of ovarian malignancy had abnormal ultrasound findings. In six of these, the findings were of a purely cystic lesion. There were 62 cases of benign ovarian pathology (excluding dermoid cyst), all of which had an abnormal ultrasound; 16 of these had possible ultrasound features of malignancy. All 30 cases of ovarian dermoid cyst had an abnormal ultrasound with a specific diagnosis being made in 27. This study shows that ultrasound is accurate in the detection of both endometrial and ovarian disease. The endometrium that is not seen or is poorly seen is an indication for endometrial biopsy in women with postmenopausal bleeding. There is considerable overlap in the ultrasound appearances of benign and malignant ovarian lesions. Ultrasound is a good method for the accurate and specific diagnosis of an ovarian dermoid cyst."

CD011126,0,24846098,0,Imaging techniques for the evaluation of ovarian cancer.,"Women with ovarian cancer often present at advanced stage of disease. The outcome depends mainly on the stage of disease at first diagnosis, but also on the quality of treatment. For individualised tumour treatment, detailed assessment of tumour extension using modern imaging is crucial. Ultrasound remains the initial and most important imaging method for ovarian cancer detection. Although increasing evidence shows that ultrasound is an accurate technique to stage and follow up ovarian cancer, it requires an experienced examiner capable of examining both the pelvis and the abdomen. Computed tomography is the most commonly used imaging modality for preoperative staging and follow up. Magnetic resonance imaging remains a second-line imaging method for solving problems, mainly in the pelvis. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography is the optimal imaging technique for suspected recurrence, particularly in women with rising CA 125 levels, but negative results of conventional imaging methods."

Included in the analysis were 17 studies for AFC, six studies for ovarian volume and six studies for stromal blood flow. Meta-analyses showed that women with AFC less than four were 8.7 times more likely not to get pregnant after IVF (two studies; 95% CI, 2.4-31.7) than women with AFC four or more. The sensitivity and specificity of AFC to predict cycle cancellation was 66.7% and 94.7%, respectively. Women with an AFC of less than four were 37 times (two studies; 95% CI, 13.68-100.45) more likely to have their cycle cancelled than women with AFC of four o r more. Ovarian volume measurement, at a cut off value of 3 cm3, showed specificity for prediction of cycle cancellation and non-pregnancy of 92% (three studies, 95% CI, 89-94) and 93% (three studies, 95% CI, 87-97), respectively.

CD011126,0,26569046,0,Genital Cancers in Women: Uterine Cancer.,"There are two main types of uterine cancer. Endometrial carcinoma, the most commonly diagnosed genital cancer in women, accounts for most cases (more than 95%) and sarcoma comprises the remainder. Endometrial cancer primarily occurs in postmenopausal women. Risk factors include exposure to high levels of endogenous estrogen (eg, obesity, nulliparity, late menopause) or exogenous estrogen (eg, hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen) and pelvic radiation. Genetics are involved in a small percentage of cases, notably among women in families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). More than 80% of patients with endometrial cancers present with abnormal uterine bleeding. Endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound are the first-line tests to evaluate bleeding. If the endometrial lining is thickened on ultrasound, endometrial biopsy is indicated. If symptoms persist after negative biopsy results, or if biopsy results are inadequate, hysteroscopy is performed for tissue sampling. Most patients with endometrial cancer are diagnosed early, when cancer is confined to the uterus. Hysterectomy is the treatment of choice in such cases. Treatment of advanced disease involves radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Perimenopausal women should be informed that abnormal bleeding could be a sign of cancer and should be evaluated. However, no routine screening is recommended except for women with HNPCC."

We report an 18-year-old patient with bilateral testicular gunshot injury. During the surgical exploration an orchiectomy of the complete ruptured left testicle was necessary. Debridement of the damaged tissue and a partial orchiectomy was performed on the right side. After the operation, the patient developed an incretory hypogonadism and oligozoospermia. During follow-up, an improvement in the sperm count and of the hormonal status occurred. These finally reached normal levels. After genital traumata, immediate surgical exploration should be performed.

Ovarian cancer on the other hand, although rare in this age group, is the most common genital tract malignancy. The purpose of this study was to define imaging characteristics of ovarian masses in adolescents between 12 and 21 years old and correlate imaging and surgical findings. Thirty-seven female adolescent patients aged between 12 and 21 years were operated on because of a diagnosed ovarian mass between 1997 and 2002. All patients underwent pelvic ultrasound, five had an abdominal CT scan, two had abdominal MRI, one abdominal X-ray and one intravenous pyelography. Ultrasound was used to define the size of the lesion and to characterize its gross morphologic condition as solid, simple cyst or complex cyst. The records were reviewed for age at presentation, presenting symptoms, diagnostic studies, surgical procedure and pathology findings, which were available for all patients. In our study 32 patients (86.5%) were symptomatic and five asymptomatic (13.5%). The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (59.5%). Thirty-four patients (91.1%) had benign lesions, two had malignant tumors (5.4%) and one patient had a borderline lesion (2.7%).

CD011126,0,22397576,0,Ovarian stimulation in women with high and normal body mass index: GnRH agonist versus GnRH antagonist.,"In modern society, obesity has become a major health problem and has been associated with impaired fertility. The aim of this study is to assess the role of obesity in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) stimulated either with GnRH agonists or with GnRH antagonists. Records of 463 women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment were reviewed. The influence of body mass index (BMI) on treatment outcome was examined, after accounting for differences in stimulation protocols. In the agonist group (286 patients), the total amount of gonadotropins used was significantly higher in patients with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², when compared to those with a normal BMI. The same result was found in the antagonist group (177 patients). No significant differences were found in length of stimulation, number of oocytes retrieved or number of embryos transferred. In both the antagonist and the agonist group, the number of clinical pregnancies was found to be higher in patients with normal BMI, suggesting that obesity could impair the ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropins. Considering the results obtained and the many theoretical advantages of GnRH antagonists, ovarian stimulation with GnRH antagonists is an efficient treatment for both women with normal and high BMI."

CD011126,0,14513789,0,Portable ultrasound scanners.,"Portable ultrasound scanners have become an increasingly significant part of the ultrasound market as their capabilities have advanced to rival those of conventional full-sized scanners. For this Evaluation, we examined seven portable scanners from four suppliers: GE, Philips, Siemens, and SonoSite. We found that these units meet all our performance criteria, offer most or all of the appropriate features for their intended applications, and are generally comparable to conventional units for those applications. Because the scanners offer comparable technical performance, our ratings focus primarily on the features and probes available. Each scanner is judged on its suitability for specific applications (such as comprehensive cardiac studies and vascular access guidance). We then translate these judgments into product ratings tailored to five hospital areas--the cardiology department, emergency department, obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) department, radiology department, and vascular lab. All seven scanners are rated at least Acceptable for the departments in which they are likely to be used. We have given Preferred ratings to those scanners that can be used as a department's only unit. This article also discusses how the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard relates to portable ultrasound, pinpoints some of the measurement and calculation errors that can be particular problems for inexperienced users, and reviews the warranty and contract services available for ultrasound scanners."

CD011126,0,15581725,0,[Recombinant activated factor VII as a life-saving therapy for severe postpartum haemorrhage unresponsive to conservative traditional management].,"Postpartum haemorrhage remains the main cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Treatment aims at maintaining hemodynamic circulation and preventing shock by stopping blood loss both medically and surgically. We report two cases of major postpartum haemorrhage due to uterine atony. Patients developed haemorrhagic shock and severe coagulation disorders (nadir values of PTT were <10% and fibrinogen was <0.1 g/l). Well-codified medical (ocytocin, sulprostone) and surgical management (ligation of both hypogastic arteries in the two cases completed by staged uterine ligation in one case) failed to stop bleeding. Recently, several case reports described successful use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in scheduled surgery, trauma and major postpartum haemorrhage. Thus, after transfusion of more than one blood mass and failure of surgical haemostasis to stop bleeding, rFVIIa (60 microg/kg) was given. A single iv bolus injection stopped ongoing diffuse haemorrhage in the two cases. No further transfusion was required afterwards in both patients. RFVIIa might thus be a strong complementary agent in the management of major postpartum haemorrhage. Optimal dose, timing and safety characteristics of rVIIa administration remain to be determined. One patient developed four weeks later thrombosis of both ovarian veins, a complication that can be related to either rFVIIa or to the staged uterine ligations performed during surgery."
CD011126,0,26477368,0,Dynamic Control of Long-Range Genomic Interactions at the Immunoglobulin κ Light-Chain Locus.,"The Igκ locus, which is spread over 3Mb of genomic DNA and contains >100 variable (V) genes, serves as an important model system to study long-range chromatin interactions. Here, we will discuss how in developing B cells in the bone marrow the accessibility of individual Vκ segments is controlled by many lineage-specific and ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that act on various cis-regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, and insulators. This dynamic control furthermore involves changes in subnuclear localization, histone modification, DNA demethylation, and three-dimensional locus compaction. In pro-B cells, the Igκ locus adopts a poised conformation as full contraction has been achieved and many key transcription factors already occupy the locus. Subsequently, the combined activation of pre-B cell antigen receptor signaling pathways and attenuation of IL-7R signaling in small resting pre-B cells dramatically modifies the transcription factor landscape, supporting the induction of monoallelic Igκ gene rearrangements. Hereby, the intronic and 3' Igκ enhancer elements coordinately focus their activities in the Vκ region toward frequently used Vκ genes. Recent work has drawn attention to the intriguing role of the CTCF-associated regulatory elements Cer and Sis, which are located in the Vκ-Jκ intervening region and control Igκ locus contraction and Vκ repertoire diversity. This involves CTCF-mediated locus insulation, restricting enhancer activity to the Vκ region and suppressing the preferential recombination to proximal Vκ genes. A picture emerges in which the dynamic control of long-range genomic interactions ensures correct timing of Igκ locus recombination and provides appropriate opportunities for individual Vκ gene segments to engage in Vκ-Jκ rearrangement."
CD011126,0,14962602,0,Uterine volume in adolescents.,"The objective of the present study was to determine the uterine volume of adolescents by ultrasonography, and to correlate it with pregnancy during adolescence and with the immaturity of the female genital tract for pregnancy and delivery. A transverse observational study was conducted on 828 patients who were 10 to 40 years old by transabdominal ultrasonography and were divided into two groups: group 1 consisted of 477 (57.6%) adolescents and group 2 consisted of 351 (42.3%) women 20 to 40 years old. Uterine volume increased with the presence of menarche, age and parity (p < 0.05). Nulliparous and primiparous adolescents younger than 18 years old had a smaller uterine volume, 41.3 +/- 17.9 and 51.6 +/- 19.7 cm(3), respectively, than nulliparous and primiparous women 20 to 40 years old (p < 0.001). However, secundiparous adolescents had a uterine volume of 62.6 +/- 20.6 cm(3), which was significantly similar to the uterine volume of women 20 to 40 years old (p = 0.22). The differences in uterine volume between adolescents younger than 18 years old or with less than two deliveries and women who were 20 to 40 years old may be due to immaturity of the female genital tract for pregnancy and delivery among younger women, with a consequent higher incidence of preterm deliveries in this group."

CD011126,0,16291137,0,The impact of 3-dimensional ultrasonography on perinatal management of a large epignathus teratoma without ex utero intrapartum treatment.,"We report a case of epignathus teratoma diagnosed at 22 weeks of gestation in which 3-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) was useful to plan perinatal management. A significant enlargement of the tumor, associated with polyhydramnios and preterm labor, was observed at 35 weeks of gestation. After amniotic fluid evacuation, 3DUS was performed in the presence of pediatricians, obstetricians, and otolaryngologists. Three-dimensional ultrasound revealed that great part of the tumor was located outside the fetal mouth and anterior to fetal mandible, suggesting that the newborn could breathe spontaneously by nasal via. A cesarean section with longitudinal hysterotomy was performed at 36 weeks followed by an immediate extirpation of the tumor and the intubation of the newborn. The management of this rare case illustrates that the ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure is not always necessary in this situation. Besides, the actual prenatal goal consists on carefully selecting fetuses with epignathus teratoma that will need the EXIT procedure from those that will not. Three-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in association with 2DUS can be helpful in this prenatal selection."

CD011126,0,23317074,0,Evaluation and treatment of endometriosis.,"Endometriosis, which affects up to 10 percent of reproductive-aged women, is the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterine cavity. It is more common in women with pelvic pain or infertility (25 to 40 percent and 70 to 90 percent, respectively). Some women with endometriosis are asymptomatic, whereas others present with symptoms such as debilitating pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and decreased fertility. Diagnosis of endometriosis in primary care is predominantly clinical. Initial treatment includes common agents used for primary dysmenorrhea, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combination estrogen/progestin contraceptives, or progestin-only contraceptives. There is some evidence that these agents are helpful and have few adverse effects. Referral to a gynecologist is necessary if symptoms persist or the patient is unable to become pregnant. Laparoscopy is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis before additional treatments are pursued. Further treatments include gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, danazol, or surgical removal of ectopic endometrial tissue. These interventions may control symptoms more effectively than initial treatments, but they can have significant adverse effects and limits on duration of therapy."

Twenty-seven women with HH received a 150 IU fixed daily subcutaneous dose of recombinant human FSH, supplemented by 75 IU daily dose of rHLH given either as a single dose (n=9; single-dose group) or four equally divided doses (n=18; split-dose group). Ovulation was defined by three efficacy end points: at least one follicle ⩾17mm in diameter, pre-ovulatory serum oestradiol ⩾400pmol/l and a midluteal progesterone ⩾25nmol/l. Although lacking statistical significance, the proportion of women in the rHLH split-dose group who fulfilled all three end points was higher than the single-dose group (72.2% versus 55.6%). Women in the split-dose group achieved higher serum oestradiol concentrations per follicle, endometrial thickness measurements and numbers of follicles than in the single-dose group (not statistically significant). The odds ratio for ovulation rate was 2.08 (not statistically significant). There were no serious untoward side effects. Administering rHLH in split daily doses could provide superior results compared with the traditional single daily dose. We conducted this clinical study to investigate whether a split daily dose protocol of recombinant human LH (rHLH) is more efficacious than the single daily dose in supporting follicular development and ovulation in primary hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH). HH is an uncommon entity that can lead to very low or undetectable serum gonadotrophin concentrations. It manifests in anovulation, amenorrhoea and subsequent infertility. Twenty-seven women with HH received a 150 IU fixed daily subcutaneous dose of recombinant human FSH, supplemented by a 75 IU daily dose of rHLH given either as a single dose (n=9; single-dose group) or four equally divided doses (n=18; split-dose group). Ovulation was defined by these three efficacy end points: at least one follicle ⩾17mm in mean diameter, pre-ovulatory serum oestradiol concentration ⩾400pmol/l and a midluteal progesterone concentration ⩾25nmol/l. The proportion of women in the rHLH split-dose group who fulfilled all three end points was higher than the single-dose group (72.2% versus 55.6%). Women in the split-dose group achieved higher serum oestradiol concentrations per follicle, endometrial thickness measurements and numbers of follicles than in the single-dose group, without statistical significance. Women who received the split-dose regimen were more likely to have ovulation than the other group. We had no serious problematic side effects.

CD011126,0,18097909,0,A survey of the value of routine intimate examination and related practices in subfertile couples.,"The practice of undertaking routine intimate examinations in the management of subfertile couples varies among clinicians. An anonymous self-administered mailed questionnaire survey was carried out to determine the current practices followed by clinicians and the rationale supporting their practice. In the absence of large comparative studies, this survey provides expert opinion regarding this practice. The questionnaire was mailed to the Fellows and members of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the Northern, Yorkshire, West Midlands and Wales regions in the UK. A total of 802 questionnaires were posted, of which 516 were returned, giving an overall response rate of 64%. The responses and comments varied. Some 62% of respondents would routinely perform a pelvic examination on all women presenting with subfertility; 23% would do so only in selected cases and 63% of the clinicians would perform a routine transvaginal ultrasound. The male partners are examined by only 19% of the clinicians. A total of 83% of the respondents were of the opinion that the survey made them think about the role and justification of intimate examinations in greater detail. The practice of intimate examination of subfertile couples varies among clinicians in the survey group. There is a need for large prospective comparative studies to study the value of this examination and related practices in the management of subfertile couples. In the absence of comparative trials, this survey provides expert opinion. It may be suggested that an intimate examination should not be carried out routinely in all subfertile couples. It could be done when it has potential to add value to the management of the patient. A pragmatic approach should be adopted in every clinical situation."
CD011126,0,17089846,0,Massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) for reduction of false positives in computer-aided detection of polyps: Suppression of rectal tubes.,"One of the limitations of the current computer-aided detection (CAD) of polyps in CT colonography (CTC) is a relatively large number of false-positive (FP) detections. Rectal tubes (RTs) are one of the typical sources of FPs because a portion of a RT, especially a portion of a bulbous tip, often exhibits a cap-like shape that closely mimics the appearance of a small polyp. Radiologists can easily recognize and dismiss RT-induced FPs; thus, they may lose their confidence in CAD as an effective tool if the CAD scheme generates such ""obvious"" FPs due to RTs consistently. In addition, RT-induced FPs may distract radiologists from less common true positives in the rectum. Therefore, removal RT-induced FPs as well as other types of FPs is desirable while maintaining a high sensitivity in the detection of polyps. We developed a three-dimensional (3D) massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) for distinction between polyps and RTs in 3D CTC volumetric data. The 3D MTANN is a supervised volume-processing technique which is trained with input CTC volumes and the corresponding ""teaching"" volumes. The teaching volume for a polyp contains a 3D Gaussian distribution, and that for a RT contains zeros for enhancement of polyps and suppression of RTs, respectively. For distinction between polyps and nonpolyps including RTs, a 3D scoring method based on a 3D Gaussian weighting function is applied to the output of the trained 3D MTANN. Our database consisted of CTC examinations of 73 patients, scanned in both supine and prone positions (146 CTC data sets in total), with optical colonoscopy as a reference standard for the presence of polyps. Fifteen patients had 28 polyps, 15 of which were 5-9 mm and 13 were 10-25 mm in size. These CTC cases were subjected to our previously reported CAD scheme that included centerline-based segmentation of the colon, shape-based detection of polyps, and reduction of FPs by use of a Bayesian neural network based on geometric and texture features. Application of this CAD scheme yielded 96.4% (27/28) by-polyp sensitivity with 3.1 (224/73) FPs per patient, among which 20 FPs were caused by RTs. To eliminate the FPs due to RTs and possibly other normal structures, we trained a 3D MTANN with ten representative polyps and ten RTs, and applied the trained 3D MTANN to the above CAD true- and false-positive detections. In the output volumes of the 3D MTANN, polyps were represented by distributions of bright voxels, whereas RTs and other normal structures partly similar to RTs appeared as darker voxels, indicating the ability of the 3D MTANN to suppress RTs as well as other normal structures effectively. Application of the 3D MTANN to the CAD detections showed that the 3D MTANN eliminated all RT-induced 20 FPs, as well as 53 FPs due to other causes, without removal of any true positives. Overall, the 3D MTANN was able to reduce the FP rate of the CAD scheme from 3.1 to 2.1 FPs per patient (33% reduction), while the original by-polyp sensitivity of 96.4% was maintained."

CD011126,0,17935126,0,Endogenous optical biomarkers of normal and human papillomavirus immortalized epithelial cells.,"Cellular transformation is associated with a number of phenotypic, cell biological, biochemical and metabolic alterations. The detection and classification of morphological cellular abnormalities represents the foundation of classical histopathology and remains an important mainstay in the clinic. More recently, significant effort is being expended towards the development of noninvasive modalities for the detection of cancer at an early stage, when therapeutic interventions are highly successful. Methods that rely on the detection of optical signatures represent one class of such approaches that have yielded promising results. In our study, we have applied two spectroscopic imaging approaches to systematically identify in a quantitative manner the fluorescence and light scattering signatures of subcellular abnormalities that are associated with cellular transformation. Notably, we find that tryptophan images reveal not only intensity but also localization differences between normal and human papillomavirus immortalized cells, possibly originating from changes in the expression, 3D packing and organization of proteins and protein-rich subcellular organelles. Additionally, we detect alterations in cellular metabolism through quantitative evaluation of the NADH, FAD fluorescence and the corresponding redox ratio. Finally, we use light scattering spectroscopy to identify differences in nuclear morphology and subcellular organization that occur from the nanometer to the micrometer scale. Thus, these optical approaches provide complementary biomarkers based on endogenous fluorescence and scattering cellular changes that occur at the molecular, biochemical and morphological level. Since they obviate the need for staining and tissue removal and can be easily combined, they provide desirable options for further clinical development and assessment."
CD011126,0,16966069,0,Image guided biopsy in the management of cancer of the ovary.,"When used in the context of multidisciplinary team discussion, image guided biopsy using ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) guidance is of value in planning management of women with suspected ovarian cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of uncertain aetiology. It is essential in women believed to have ovarian cancer but with poor performance status or with advanced disease believed beyond the scope of primary cytoreductive surgery for whom staging surgical pathology will not be obtained. It provides a site-specific primary tumour diagnosis in 93% of cases and it should replace diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy for this purpose. It allows provision of primary (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy based on a firm histological diagnosis. It is mandatory in women with a history of cancer whose metastases may mimic ovarian cancer (e.g. breast, GI tract, melanoma). More women with prior breast cancer who re-present with peritoneal cancer will have a new gynaecological primary than recurrence of their original primary tumour; the two options require radically different therapies. Finally it is a valuable problem solving tool in situations of diagnostic uncertainty, e.g. unusual imaging patterns of disease such as PC with bilateral solid ovarian masses or non-enlarged ovaries and with an unusual tumour marker profiles suggesting primary tumours outwith the ovary. The technique is simple, safe and effective and can be combined with palliative drainage of ascites at the same procedure."
CD011126,0,16358611,0,[Two post-menopausal women with vaginal bleeding due to non-gynaecological malignancies].,"A gynaecological examination was performed because of vaginal bleeding in a 67-year-old woman who was admitted for dyspnoea and a painful cough. A tumour was detected in the vaginal wall that turned out to be a metastasis of a locally extensive and metastasised Grawitz tumour. In a 76-year-old woman who presented with vaginal bleeding, speculum examination revealed a polyp that protruded from the cervix. A non-Hodgkin lymphoma was demonstrated histopathologically. In both patients, the cervical smear showed Pap-I. Both patients were given palliative treatment. According to the guidelines, the policy of general practitioners and gynaecologists in cases of postmenopausal blood loss should be directed primarily at the exclusion of malignancy by means of transvaginal echoscopy. However, some abnormalities may then be missed. A complete gynaecological examination then becomes very important. Speculum examination forms an essential part of such a work-up."

CD011126,0,25456857,0,Blockade of EMAP II protects cardiac function after chronic myocardial infarction by inducing angiogenesis.,"Promoting angiogenesis is a key therapeutic target for protection from chronic ischemic cardiac injury. Endothelial-Monocyte-Activating-Polypeptide-II (EMAP II) protein, a tumor-derived cytokine having anti-angiogenic properties in cancer, is markedly elevated following myocardial ischemia. We examined whether neutralization of EMAP II induces angiogenesis and has beneficial effects on myocardial function and structure after chronic myocardial infarction (MI). EMAP II antibody (EMAP II AB), vehicle, or non-specific IgG (IgG) was injected ip at 30 min and 3, 6, and 9 days after permanent coronary artery occlusion in mice. EMAP II AB, compared with vehicle or non-specific antibody, significantly, p<0.05, improved the survival rate after MI, reduced scar size and attenuated the development of heart failure, i.e., left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in EMAP II AB group, fibrosis was reduced by 24%, and importantly, more myocytes were alive in EMAP II AB group in the infarct area. In support of an angiogenic mechanism, capillary density (193/HPF vs. 172/HPF), doubling of the number of proliferating endothelial cells, and angiogenesis related biomarkers were upregulated in mice receiving EMAP II AB treatment as compared to IgG. Furthermore, EMAP II AB prevented EMAP II protein inhibition of in vitro tube formation in HUVECs. We conclude that blockade of EMAP II induces angiogenesis and improves cardiac function following chronic MI, resulting in reduced myocardial fibrosis and scar formation and increased capillary density and preserved viable myocytes in the infarct area."

However, it is not uncommon for routine pathology examination to report no significant fibroids in such cases. Myometrial hyperplasia (MMH) is a structural variation with irregular zones of hypercellularity and increased nucleus/cell ratio that appears in adolescence, can progress during the childbearing years, and can sometimes cause grossly detectable bulges on pathologic examination. MMH can be inframucosal, intramural (microscopic), or subserosal. Three premenopausal women with a preoperative diagnosis of fibroids on pelvic examination, and/or sonograms, underwent hysterectomies. In all the 3 cases, the Myoma Index (number of fibroids×size of largest fibroid) indicated insignificant fibroids. The pathology simulating fibroids was firm, bulging inframucosal MMH. Firm, bulging MMH can mimic uterine fibroids on ultrasound and physical examination. In hysterectomies for fibroid uterus with a Myoma Index <3.7, it is recommended that pathologists evaluate for MMH as the possible explanation for the findings on physical examination and/or ultrasound."

CD011126,0,24879045,0,A combined ultrasound and histologic approach for analysis of uterine fibroid pseudocapsule thickness.,"Authors investigated 75 patients with uterine myomas, appraising whether fibroid pseudocapsule (FP) thickness varies depending on fibroid location, by a prospective cohort trial (level of evidence II-2) settled in University-affiliated Hospitals. Uteri were scanned via bidimensional and power Doppler ultrasound (US) to map the fibroids and record the FP thickness, prior to hysterectomy for symptomatic uterine fibroids. After hysterectomy, FP specimens were sampled and analyzed by pathologists. Ultrasound and histology data were matched. Pseudocapsule thickness of 108 fibroids was measured: subserosal fibroids (SSFs), intramural fibroids (IMFs), and fibroids near the endometrial cavity (FEC). The FEC's pseudocapsules were considerably thicker than those of IMF and SSF measured by US and histology (P = .001). A clear cutoff existed between FEC pseudocapsule thickness and all other pseudocapsules, with significant differences observed at 2 mm (P = .001). Similarity between histological and US measurements was observed only with IMF pseudocapsules, whereas FEC or SSF showed significant differences. The pseudocapsule of fibroids is considerably thicker near the endometrial cavity when compared to those of both IMFs and SSFs. Since fibroids closest to the endometrial cavity are the most involved in fertility and infertility and FP is considerably thicker near the endometrial cavity, it is possible to hypothesize an involvement of FP of fibroid near the endometrium since FP contains many neuropeptides and neurotransmitters that are physiologically active, even if these data may take on a broader meaning in a study on a larger number of patients."

CD011126,0,18160044,0,Atypical AAA+ subunit packing creates an expanded cavity for disaggregation by the protein-remodeling factor Hsp104.,"Hsp104, a yeast protein-remodeling factor of the AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily, and its homologs in bacteria and plants mediate cell recovery after severe stress by disaggregating denatured proteins through a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy maps and domain fitting of Hsp104 hexamers, revealing an unusual arrangement of AAA+ modules with the prominent coiled-coil domain intercalated between the AAA+ domains. This packing results in a greatly expanded cavity, which is capped at either end by N- and C-terminal domains. The fitted structures as well as mutation of conserved coiled-coil arginines suggest that the coiled-coil domain plays a major role in the extraction of proteins from aggregates, providing conserved residues for key functions in ATP hydrolysis and potentially for substrate interaction. The large cavity could enable the uptake of polypeptide loops without a requirement for exposed N or C termini."

CD011126,0,19755155,0,Utilising atomic force microscopy for the characterisation of nanoscale drug delivery systems.,"The introduction of atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques has revolutionised our ability to characterise colloidal objects. AFM allows the visualisation of samples with sub-nanometre resolution in three dimensions in atmospheric or submerged conditions. Nanomedical research is increasingly focused on the design, characterisation and delivery of nano-sized drug carriers such as nanoparticles, liposomes and polyplexes, and this review aims to highlight the scope and advantages of AFM in this area. A significant amount of work has been carried out in drug delivery system (DDS) research in recent years using a large variety of techniques. The use of AFM has enabled us to directly observe very small objects without the need of a cumbersome and potentially contaminating sample preparation. Thus, nanoscale DDS can be investigated in a controlled environment without the necessity of staining or drying. Moreover, intermittent contact mode AFM allows the investigation of soft samples with minimal sample alteration; phase imaging allows accessing information beyond the sample's topography and also differentiating between different materials, and force spectroscopy experiments help us to understand the intrinsic structure of DDS by recording the elastic or adhesion behaviour of particles. Hence, AFM enables us accessing information which is hardly available by other experimental techniques. It has provided invaluable information about physicochemical properties and helped to shed light on the area of nanoscale drug delivery and will, with more and more sophisticated equipment becoming available, continue to add to our understanding of the behaviour of nanoscale DDS in the future."

In the current study, we report good reliability in follicle counts when observers imposed a programmable grid system over the viewing window. Four observers estimated total follicle counts in 45 ovarian ultrasound scans by compartmentalizing the ovary into 9 to 12 grid sections and performing focused follicle counts per section. The mean number of follicles counted per ovary was 44.6 +/- 2.3. The level of inter-observer agreement when making follicle counts was 0.82 and total follicle counts did not differ among observers. The level of intra-observer agreement was 0.93 which further corroborated the utility of this method for making dependable follicle counts. In summary, the ability to obtain reproducible follicle counts will help to establish reliable diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovarian morphology."

Case report and review of the literature.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant neurocutaneous disorder with multi-organ involvement. The diagnosis is suspected at fetal ultrasound on the discovery of multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas (CRs). They typically develop in utero and undergo spontaneous regression during the first years of live. With developing neuroradiological methods more light is shed on antenatal cerebral lesions like cortical tubers or giant cell astrocytomas. Unfortunately these do not regress, but instead are in principle progressive in size and number, correlated with epilepsy, mental retardation and behavioral problems. It is unknown whether fetal cerebral lesions, are always correlated with a poor neurological outcome or a progressive course of disease. This makes prenatal counseling extremely difficult. We report one case of de novo TSC with first detection of cortical tubers on fetal ultrasound, later developing multiple CRs. The pregnancy was continued and the child is developing well during 16 months of follow-up. Minor motor seizures from the 10th month onwards are successfully treated with Valproate.

CD011126,0,20587961,0,An estimate of the rate of growth of a juvenile aggressive ossifying fibroma in a 15 year old child.,Juvenile ossifying fibroma (JOF) is an uncommon fibro-osseous lesion occurring in the facial bones. It has been recognised as a separate histopathological entity among the fibro-osseous group of lesions. Fibro-osseous lesions of the craniofacial bones are difficult to classify and treat however a common factor to all is the conversion of the bone to benign fibrous tissue with a varying degree of mineralised tissue. This case describes a 15 year old patient with a juvenile aggressive ossifying fibroma (JAOF) and an estimate of the rate of growth of such a rare lesion.

CD011126,0,20304321,0,Contemporary pediatric gynecologic imaging.,"Ultrasound is the primary screening modality for the evaluation of pediatric gynecologic maladies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used progressively more in this field, particularly for the evaluation of complex pelvic masses and congenital anomalies. However, ultrasound remains the preferred modality due to the excellent visualization, the dynamic nature of the examination modality, lack of ionizing radiation and sedation risks, and comparatively lower cost. MRI is generally a second-line examination and is preferred over computed tomography as it does not involve the use of ionizing radiation. Additionally, visualization of the female reproductive system anatomy with MRI is superior to computed tomography, the latter being reserved generally for tumor staging. Fluoroscopic examinations and abdominal radiographs can provide additional information that may support a diagnosis."
CD011126,0,24065269,0,Novel use of contrast-enhanced sonography in the diagnosis of central uterine necrosis following embolization for postpartum hemorrhage.,"Since 2007, we have identified 2 cases of central uterine necrosis after uterine arterial embolization for postpartum hemorrhage. Contrast-enhanced sonography showed an absence of enhancement of the internal myometrium. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium confirmed the diagnosis. The images obtained for the first case were corroborated by histologic analysis from a hysterectomy done for sepsis. For the second case, contrast-enhanced sonography performed during a follow-up period of conservative treatment revealed a reduction of necrosis. Our study shows that contrast-enhanced sonography seems to be a useful examination as an adjunct to grayscale and power Doppler imaging in the diagnosis and follow-up of uterine necrosis."
CD011126,0,16237143,0,CT colonography: where have we been and where are we going?,"Over the past decade, computed tomographic (CT) colonography (also known as virtual colonoscopy) has been used to investigate the colon for colorectal neoplasia. Numerous clinical and technical advances have allowed CT colonography to advance slowly from a research tool to a viable option for colorectal cancer screening. However, substantial controversy remains among radiologists, gastroenterologists, and other clinicians with regard to the current role of CT colonography in clinical practice. On the one hand, all agree there is much excitement about a noninvasive imaging examination that can reliably depict clinically important colorectal lesions. However, this is tempered by results from several recent studies that show the sensitivity of CT colonography may not be as great when performed and the images interpreted by radiologists without expertise and training. The potential to miss important lesions exists; moreover, if polyps cannot be differentiated from folds and residual fecal matter, unnecessary colonoscopy will be performed. In this review, current issues will be discussed regarding colon cancer and the established and reimbursed strategies to screen for it and the past, current, and potential future role of CT colonography."

CD011126,0,17925730,0,[Precancerous lesions of the gallbladder].,"This Mini-review summarizes the epidemiology, predisposing and pre-cancerous conditions related to carcinoma of the gallbladder. In 75% of cases, gallbladder cancer is a cholangiocarcinoma, usually presenting in a late and advanced stage, and it carries one of the worst prognoses of all GI malignancies. Early stage disease is usually discovered incidentally by the pathologist in a gallbladder specimen removed for calculous cholecystitis. It occurs three times more frequently in women than in men and invasive forms usually occur after the age of 60. Incidence varies with geographic location. Besides genetic and geographic factors, the presence of one or more large gallstones is a major risk factor. Gallbladder polyps larger than 1.5 cm. (especially solitary sessile hypoechogenic polyps) are associated with a 50% risk of malignancy. Choledochal cysts and other variations of the biliopancreatic junction are also associated with high risk; cancer may occur at a much younger age in these patients and in the absence of gallstones. Porcelain gallbladder is a risk factor, particularly when there is calcification of the gallbladder mucosa. Chronic gallbladder infection has been implicated as a risk factor for malignant degeneration. Finally, cancer of both the gallbladder and the bile ducts is more frequent in patients suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis."
CD011126,0,22727957,0,Thrombospondin-1 mimetic peptide ABT-898 affects neovascularization and survival of human endometriotic lesions in a mouse model.,"Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain and infertility in women, and a common indication for hysterectomy, yet the disease remains poorly diagnosed and ineffectively treated. Because endometriotic lesions require new blood supply for survival, inhibiting angiogenesis could provide a novel therapeutic strategy. ABT-898 mimics the antiangiogenic properties of thrombospondin-1, so we hypothesized that ABT-898 will prevent neovascularization of human endometriotic lesions and that ABT-898 treatment will not affect reproductive outcomes in a mouse model. Endometriosis was induced in BALB/c-Rag2(-/-)Il2rg(-/-) mice by surgical implantation of human endometrial fragments in the peritoneal cavity. Mice received daily injections of ABT-898 for 21 days. Flow cytometry was performed to measure circulating endothelial progenitor cells in peripheral blood. Cytokines were measured in plasma samples. Half of the ABT-898-treated and control mice were euthanized to assess neovascularization of endometriotic lesions, using CD31(+) immunofluorescence. The remaining mice were mated and euthanized at gestation day 12. Endometriotic lesions increased circulating endothelial progenitor cells 13 days after engraftment, relative to baseline. Endometriotic lesions from ABT-898-treated mice exhibited reduced neovascularization, compared with controls, and lesions had fewer CD31(+) microvessels. Chronic treatment with ABT-898 did not lead to any fetal anomalies or affect litter size at gestation day 12, compared with controls. Our results suggest that ABT-898 inhibits neovascularization of human endometriotic lesions without affecting mouse fecundity."

The aim was to develop prognostic models for identification of standard (ovulatory and normal basal FSH) patients’ risks of low and excessive response to conventional stimulation for IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Prospectively collected data on 276 first-cycle patients treated with 150 IU recombinant FSH (rFSH)/day in a long agonist protocol were analysed. Logistic regression analysis was applied to the outcome variables:low (seven or less follicles) and excessive (20 or more follicles) response. Variables were woman’s age, menstrual cycle length, weight or body mass index, ovarian volume, antral follicle count (AFC) and basal FSH. The predictive performance of the models was evaluated from the prediction error (Brier score, %) where zero corresponds to a perfect prediction. Model stability was assessed using 1000 bootstrap cross-validation steps. The best prognostic model to predict low response included AFC and age (Brier score 7.94) and the best model to predict excessive response included AFC and cycle length (Brier score 15.82). Charts were developed to identify risks of low and excessive ovarian response. They can be used for evidence-based risk assessment before ovarian stimulation and may assist clinicians in individual dosage of their patients."

CD011126,0,21868744,0,Male accessory gland infection frequency in infertile patients with chronic microbial prostatitis and irritable bowel syndrome: transrectal ultrasound examination helps to understand the links.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of male accessory gland infection (MAGI) in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) plus irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to compare the sperm parameters of patients with or without MAGI. In addition, another objective of this study was to evaluate the ultrasound characterization of the anatomical space between the posterior wall of the prostate and the anterior wall of the rectum using transrectal ultrasonography. Fifty consecutive patients with the following criteria were enrolled: 1) infertility, 2) diagnosis of CBP, and 3) diagnosis of IBS according to the Rome III criteria. The following 2 age-matched control groups were also studied: infertile patients with CBP alone (n = 56) and fertile men (n = 30) who had fathered a child within the previous 3 months. Patients and controls underwent an accurate patient history; administration of the National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index and the Rome III questionnaires for prostatitis and IBS, respectively; physical examination; semen analysis; and transrectal ultrasound evaluation (limited to patients with CBP and IBS or CBP alone). A significantly higher frequency of MAGI was found in patients with CBP plus IBS (82.0%) compared with patients with CBP alone (53.6%) or fertile men (0%). The presence of MAGI in patients with CBP plus IBS was associated with a significantly lower sperm concentration, total number, and forward motility, and with a higher seminal leukocyte concentration compared with patients with CBP alone and MAGI. Sperm normal morphology was similar in the groups of patients. All sperm parameters did not differ significantly in both groups of patients without MAGI. With ultrasound evaluation, a significantly higher frequency of dilatation of prostatic venous plexus was found in patients with CBP plus IBS (75%) compared with patients with CBP alone (10%). Patients with CBP plus IBS had a significantly higher frequency of MAGI compared with patients with CBP alone. This was associated with worse sperm parameters and, hence, poorer reproductive prognosis. We suggest searching for the presence of IBS in patients with prostatitis syndrome, in particular when CBP and/or worse sperm parameters are present. Finally, this is the first observation on ultrasound examination of the anatomical space between the posterior wall of the prostate and the anterior wall of the rectum reported in patients with CBP and IBS. Further studies should clarify the meaning of the ultrasound findings."

Extraction process was accelerated using sonication. Three level, three variable face-centered cubic experimental design (FCD) with response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimization of extraction in terms of maximized yields for total phenolics (TP), flavonoids (TF), anthocyanins (MA) and proanthocyanidins (TPA) contents. Ultrasonic power (X₁: 72-216 W), temperature (X₂: 30-70 °C) and extraction time (X₃: 30-90 min) were investigated as independent variables. Experimental results were fitted to a second-order polynomial model where multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance were used to determine fitness of the model and optimal conditions for investigated responses. Three-dimensional surface plots were generated from the mathematical models. The optimal conditions for ultrasound-assisted extraction of TP, TF, MA and TPA were: X₁=206.64 W, X₂=70 °C, X₃=80.1 min; X₁=210.24 W, X₂=70 °C, X₃=75 min; X₁=216 W, X₂=70 °C, X₃=45.6 min and X₁=199.44 W, X₂=70 °C, X₃=89.7 min, respectively. Generated model predicted values of the TP, TF, MA and TPA to be 15.41 mg GAE/ml, 9.86 mg CE/ml, 2.26 mg C3G/ml and 20.67 mg CE/ml, respectively.

Herein, we present a rare case of low-grade ESS presented as prevesical mass. A 60-yr-old woman who had undergone total hysterectomy for endometriosis eleven years ago was presented with incidentally detected prevesical pelvic mass. Since malignant transformation of urachal remnants was possible, the mass was suspected to be a urachal tumor. Extraction of the mass was performed, and the histopathologic diagnosis was low-grade ESS. In summary, prevesical tumor is rare but in patients with endometriosis, we suggest endometriosis and its possible malignant changes should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of prevesical mass."

With a new transvaginal system, ultrasound-assisted culdotomy, and laparoscopy supported cystectomy if vaginal procedure failed. The authors conducted a retrospective review in which 35 cases using new vaginal ovarian cystectomy were compared with 40 cases of laparoscopic cystectomy for the treatment of dermoid cyst. All cystectomies were completed without conversion to laparotomy and complications. In a case from vaginal group, laparoscopy was required. No differences existed in operating time, hemoglobin decrease, and C-reactive protein value between groups. Laparoscopically supported vaginal ovarian cystectomy with ultrasound-guided culdotomy was equivalent to laparoscopic cystectomy as to invasiveness and preserved the option of a completely vaginal approach. When a presumed benign dermoid cyst is located in cul-de-sac, this operation may represent a preferable alternative to an exclusively laparoscopic or exclusively vaginal ovarian cystectomy."

Transvaginal sonography revealed a vascularized tumor mass with a deep invasion of the myometrium, partly with echogenic, solid parts and partly multiple echo-free cystic lesions. The maximum size of an echo-free cystic lesion was 4.4 cm. Doppler exploration indicated the presence of blood flow in all these cystic lesions. Distinctly abnormal low flow indices were prominent in the whole tumor area. According to the clinical results and the slightly positive levels of human chorionic beta-gonadotropin (100-1,000 IU/l postpartum), this tumor was classified as malignant trophoblastic disease, most likely PSTT. The authors conclude that, in the case of a patient with suspected trophoblastic disease and in view of the sonographic findings, PSTT may be a valid differential diagnosis, particularly if larger cystic lesions of more than 3 cm in diameter are found in the tumor bed together with evident blood flow at a low vascular resistance."

CD011126,0,19163707,0,Therapy planning and monitoring of tissue ablation by high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) using imaging and simulation.,"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) 'cooks' or ablates the target tissue at the focus of the ultrasound beam by thermal and cavitation effects. The HIFU is emerging as a non-invasive method for tumor ablation. The HIFU application for tissue ablation requires tools for dosimetry therapy planning, and real-time feedback of the intended and actual target tissues. Pretreatment planning is an important step for a successful HIFU therapy outcome. Typically, the therapy planning approach involves the use of pretreatment imaging data, defining the target and surrounding tissues by manual or semiautomatic segmentation, development of a 3-D anatomy model of the region of interest from segmentation or registration with a reference dataset, simulation of the HIFU beam and thermal dosimetry around the target tissue, display and 3-D visualization of imaging and simulation data, and review of the treatment plan options. Recent developments in therapy planning using imaging are targeted for specific applications such as prostate cancer using 3-D ultrasound images and uterine fibroids using MRI. However, significant developments have been accomplished in image guidance and feedback during the delivery of HIFU treatments. This talk reviews recent work towards therapy planning and presents approaches for developing strategies for HIFU therapy. It describes general and target-specific techniques and software tools for HIFU treatment planning using pretherapy imaging, and monitoring and controlling the HIFU delivery and tissue lesion using 1D, 2D and 3D ultrasound imaging. This aids development of optimized, high-precision HIFU applications for a controlled ablation of the target tumor. It also potentially reduces the overall treatment duration and exposure to non-target tissues."

This may be attributed to the poor delineation of the correct lesional site by clinical observation alone. In this study, optical coherence tomography is used to quantify the contrast between solid- and fluid-filled lesions by measuring the light intensity change at the tissue-fluid interface (intensity drop). This parameter was measured from sequential axial scans (n ≈ 10(6) per sample) of 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) datasets from control tissues (n = 14) and fluid-filled lesions (n = 7) and displayed as a 2D-scaled intensity drop (SID) image. The results of the SID image allowed for discrimination, characterisation and extent of a fluid filled region.

Instead, it is only 1 component of the larger and more complex preterm birth syndrome. Premature cervical ripening, as evidenced by shortening and effacement beginning at the internal os, provides strong evidence that parturition has begun and is the result of multiple interrelated pathways and inciting factors. Ultrasonographic screening of the cervix and treatment with cerclage for cervical shortening in the mid-trimester is reserved for women with prior spontaneous preterm birth (Fig. 1). Although cerclage benefit increases as the cervix shortens to less than 25 mm, it is appropriate to offer cerclage to women with shortened cervical length of less than 25 mm, and particularly those with a coexistent U-shaped funnel."

Infertility was the only complaint in 1215 cases (group 1), whereas 369 patients complained of infertility and CPP (group 2). All cases underwent routine infertility investigation and pelvic ultrasonography, followed by diagnostic laparoscopy, with infertility-only cases acting as a control group. At laparoscopy 76.7% of patients with CPP were found with pelvic pathology, compared with only 42.6% of cases without CPP (P < or = 0.0001). Omental-abdominal wall adhesions, advanced endometriosis, endometriomas with adhesions, pelvic venous congestion, and hydrosalpinges with pelvic adhesions were significantly more frequent in cases with CPP. Dysmenorrhoea was the most frequent type of CPP. Cases with CPP and a negative laparoscopy were further investigated using a multidisciplinary approach. In conclusion, chronic pelvic pain can be the result of several pelvic pathologies. Infertile patients with CPP are much more frequently found with an abnormal pelvis in comparison with cases without CPP. Laparoscopy is an invaluable diagnostic tool especially for symptomatic patients and should be used early in their diagnostic infertility work-up."

CD011126,0,15511345,0,Increased implantation and pregnancy rates obtained by placing the tip of the transfer catheter in the central area of the endometrial cavity.,"The influence of endometrial cavity length (ECL) on implantation and pregnancy rates after 400 embryo transfers was studied prospectively in a population with the indication of IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The tip of the transfer catheter was placed above or below the half point of the ECL in a randomized manner. Two analyses were performed: (i) absolute position (AP); embryo transfers were divided into three groups according to the distance between the end of the fundal endometrial surface and the catheter tip (DTC - distance tip catheter): AP1 (n = 212), 10-15 mm; AP2 (n = 158), 16-20 mm; and AP3 (n = 30), > or =21 mm. (ii) relative position (RP)--embryo transfers were divided into four groups according to their RP [RP = (DTC/ECL) x 100]: RP1 (n = 23), < or =40%; RP2 (n = 177), 41-50%; RP3 (n = 117), 51-60%; and RP4 (n = 83), > or =61%. Analysis based on relative distance revealed significantly higher implantation and pregnancy rates (P < 0.05) in more central areas of the ECL. However, analysis based on absolute position did not reveal any difference. In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that implantation and pregnancy rates are influenced by the site of embryo transfer, with better results being obtained when the catheter tip is positioned close to the middle area of the endometrial cavity. In this respect, previous analysis of the ECL is the fundamental step in establishing the ideal site for embryo transfers."
CD011126,0,15511346,0,Partial hydatidiform mole following the transfer of single frozen-thawed embryo subsequent to ICSI.,Hydatiform mole is a gestational trophoblastic disease characterized by the dominance of dispermic fertilization. Micromanipulation techniques in assisted reproduction technologies have enabled direct evaluation of the zygotes and the formation of pronuclei in the zygote. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of oocytes ensures that only a single spermatozoon enters the ooplasma. This study reports a case of partial hydatiform mole following the transfer of day 3 frozen-thawed embryo. ICSI was used as the assisted fertilization method because there was male factor infertility due to severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Possible predisposing factors for partial hydatidiform mole after ICSI are also discussed.
CD011126,0,18549701,0,Antibubble trajectory during embryo transfers in donor egg IVF does not predict success.,"Transient motion of embryo transfer-associated antibubbles was observed. This prospective study was performed to determine if this antibubble movement can predict a successful outcome. Transabdominal ultrasound-guided embryo transfers were performed in 187 recipients receiving identical hormone replacement therapy. All embryo transfers were performed by the first author, using the Sureview embryo transfer catheter, in 30 mul of culture media. Observation was made of the catheter placement in relation to the endometrial surface and uterine fundus during embryo transfer. Ultrasound-guided tracking of antibubble within the uterine cavity was done immediately after the piston was depressed at the time of embryo deposition. The antibubble movement was upwards (group A) in 104 embryo transfers and downwards (group B) in 83 transfers. No movement of embryo-associated air out of the uterine cavity, either into the cervix or the intramural portion of the Fallopian tube, was observed. The clinical pregnancy rate was similar in both groups: 47.12% in group A versus 45.78% in group B. The total implantation rate/embryo transferred was 19.34% in group A compared with 20.07% in group B. The movement of the embryo transfer-associated antibubble is unlikely to be a factor in predicting success in donor egg IVF cycles."

CD011126,0,19298733,0,Individual ovarian volumes obtained from 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional ultrasound lack precision.,"Measuring ovarian volume has been suggested as a possible screening test to assess a woman's ovarian reserve. For such a screening tool to be clinically useful, knowledge of its precision and reproducibility is essential. Recent advances in ultrasound scanning techniques allow the measurement of volumes in three dimensions rather than the traditional estimation from two dimensions. Transvaginal 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound examinations were performed on 49 women attending a tertiary centre for investigation or treatment for subfertility between January and May 2006. Two observers calculated ovarian volume using both 2D (prolate ellipsoid formula) and 3D techniques [virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL)] with rotation steps of 30 degrees (3D-30). For the four comparisons (inter- and intra-observer; 2D and 3D-30) intraclass coefficients of 0.97 to 0.98, and standard errors ranging from 17% to 14% (for inter-observer 2D and intra-observer 3D, respectively) were obtained. The corresponding coefficients of repeatability ranged from 33% to 28%. These results suggest that measurement of transvaginal ovarian volumes using both 2D and 3D ultrasound is imprecise for individuals. The imprecision is greater for lower ovarian volumes, which may be important in clinical practice. The average of two or more measurements is likely to be more accurate than a single measurement."

Excision of the obstructed vaginal septum is the treatment of choice for symptom relief and the preservation of reproductive capability. A 14-yr-old girl complained of persistent vaginal spotting following each menstruation. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed a uterus didelphys with left hematocolpos and ipsilateral renal agenesis. Instead of conventional transvaginal excision of the vaginal septum, we used hysteroscopic excision under transabdominal ultrasonographic guidance to preserve the integrity of the hymen. The postoperative course was uneventful, and clinical symptoms were completely resolved after this intervention. Resectoscopic excision of the vaginal septum was found to be easy, safe, effective, and appropriate for young women as it preserved hymen integrity. We believe that this is the first Korean report on the use of a hysteroscopy for vaginal septum resection in a patient with uterus didelphys with obstructed hemivagina."
CD011126,0,23479716,0,"Imaging effects of radiation therapy in the abdomen and pelvis: evaluating ""innocent bystander"" tissues.","Accurate interpretation of posttherapeutic images obtained in radiation oncology patients requires familiarity with modern radiation therapy techniques and their expected effects on normal tissues. Three-dimensional conformal external-beam radiation therapy techniques (eg, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy), although they are designed to reduce the amount of normal tissue exposed to high-dose radiation, inevitably increase the amount of normal tissue that is exposed to low-dose radiation, with the potential for resultant changes that may evolve over time. Currently available internal radiation therapy techniques (eg, arterial radioembolization for hepatic malignancies, brachytherapy for prostate cancer and gynecologic cancers) also carry risks of possible injury to adjacent nontargeted tissues. The sensitivity of tissues to radiation exposure varies according to the tissue type but is generally proportional to the rate of cellular division, with rapidly regenerating tissues such as intestinal mucosa being the most radiosensitive. The characteristic response to radiation-induced injury likewise varies according to tissue type, with atrophy predominating in epithelial tissue whereas fibrosis predominates in stromal tissue. Moreover, changes in irradiated tissues evolve over time: In the liver, decreased attenuation at computed tomography and increased signal intensity at T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging reflect hyperemia and edema in the early posttherapeutic period; later, veno-occlusive changes alter the hepatic enhancement pattern; and finally, fibrosis develops in some patients. In the small bowel, wall thickening and mucosal hyperenhancement predominate initially, whereas luminal narrowing is the most prominent feature of chronic enteropathy. Correlation of posttherapeutic images with images used for treatment planning may be helpful when interpreting complex cases."
CD011126,0,17695127,0,Automatic correction of level set based subvoxel precise centerlines for virtual colonoscopy using the colon outer wall.,"Virtual colonoscopy (VC) is becoming a more prevalent method to detect and diagnose colorectal cancer. An essential component of using VC to detect cancerous polyps, especially in conjunction with computer-aided diagnosis, is the accurate calculation of the centerline of the colon. While the colon is often modeled as a simple cylinder, the amount of colonic distention may vary between patients and within the same patient often causing loops and multiple disconnected segments to be present in the colon segmentation. These variations have caused previous centerline algorithms to fail to capture a complete and accurate centerline for all colons. We have developed an automatic method to determine from a computed tomography (CT) VC a subvoxel precise centerline that is accurate even in cases of over-distended or under-distended colons. In this algorithm, the loops in the colon caused by over-distention are detected and removed when the centerline calculation is performed. Also, a newly developed method for the detection and segmentation of the outer wall of the colon is used to connect collapsed portions of the colon where the lumen segmentation fails to produce a continuous centerline. These two methods allow for a complete and accurate centerline to be calculated in uniformly distended colons as well as in colons containing segments which are over-distended and/or under-distended. We have demonstrated successfully the effectiveness of our algorithm on 50 cases, 25 of which resulted in erroneous solutions by previous centerline algorithms due to variability in the colon distention."

CD011126,0,17081934,0,Ultrasound assessment of the endometrium for irregular vaginal bleeding.,"Irregular vaginal bleeding is a common symptom of women seeking gynecologic care. Etiologies of irregular vaginal bleeding can be classified into the following categories: pregnancy related (retained products of conception, threatened or missed abortion, or ectopic pregnancy), hormonal (disorders of ovulation, menopause, or hormonal contraceptive use), structural (polyps, myomas, or arteriovenous malformation), neoplasm (endometrial cancer), and infection (endometritis). After the history and physical examination, the initial evaluation of irregular vaginal bleeding has traditionally involved an endometrial biopsy. Transvaginal ultrasound has revolutionized the evaluation of the gynecologic ultrasound examination by providing a minimally invasive means to determine the etiology for the bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound assessment of the endometrial cavity allows treatment to be tailored to the specific cause of irregular vaginal bleeding, thus saving women time, money, and exposure to unnecessary interventions. The purpose of this article is to give the clinician critical information regarding the capabilities of ultrasound to evaluate women with irregular vaginal bleeding."

The prevalence of the retroverted uterus is 79% more common in the urogynaecological patient population (34%) than in the general gynaecological population (19%). Its diagnosis requires the use of (a) transvaginal ultrasound with (b) an empty bladder. Recent data demonstrate that the prevalence of grade 2-4 uterine prolapse for a retroverted uterus is 4.5 times that for an anteverted uterus. Alternatively, 69% grade 2-4 uterine prolapse involves the retroverted uterus. The retroverted uterus, when diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound (bladder empty), is far more common in urogynecology patients due to their higher incidence of prolapse."

CD011126,0,22104753,0,Technicalities of colonoscopy: endoscopic microscopy - where are we heading?,"Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a new endoscopic imaging tool enabling in vivo histology during ongoing endoscopy. Basically, three different patterns can be seen in the colon: normal, neoplastic and inflammatory mucosa. Several pilot studies have shown an excellent correlation with classical histology. However, what could be the future indications of CLE? (1) Differentiating neoplastic from inflammatory changes constitutes a promising diagnostic tool in screening for dysplasia in ulcerative colitis. This can help to further increase the efficacy of chromoendoscopy in dysplasia detection and reduce the number of biopsies. The possibility to differentiate sporadic adenoma from dysplasia-associated lesion or mass could have an immediate impact on patient management. (2) The diagnosis of collagenous colitis depends on multiple random biopsies. Case series have shown that CLE can guide the endoscopist to take more representative biopsies to make the diagnosis. Large prospective trials are needed to confirm this finding. (3) An interesting clinical application is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). A pilot study showed that it was possible to predict the presence of GVHD in 14/19 patients with GVHD out of 35 patients who were referred for diarrhea after stem cell transplantation. (4) CLE for standard polyp surveillance is probably redundant since it will not change patient management at this stage. Moreover, it can currently not differentiate between classical hyperplastic and sessile serrated adenomas. (5) Future additional technological improvements of the system with faster Z-scanning, deeper light penetration and 3D reconstruction will help to improve the quality of CLE. Reports on in vivo molecular imaging and assessment of physiological changes provide a promising glance at the future possibilities of CLE imaging."

CD011126,0,21495801,0,Unusually rapid growth of bilateral endometriomas and acute bilateral hydronephrosis.,"Ultrasonography can detect ovarian endometriomas, but negative findings cannot exclude other localizations of endometriosis, especially in symptomatic patients. We describe a case of sudden development of large bilateral endometriomas after a series of negative ultrasound scans, causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Our patient is a 32-year-old nulligravida with long-lasting dysmenorrhea, urinary symptoms, and familiarity for endometriosis, who had voluntarily discontinued oral contraceptives. Various pelvic scans had not shown pathological findings. Five months following the last negative scan, she presented with pain and increase of abdominal girth. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed large ovarian cysts (16 cm right - 10 cm left) and hydronephrosis bilaterally. She underwent conservative surgery followed by GnRH analogs. At a 6-months follow-up, she was symptom-free and ultrasonography showed no recurrence. Endometriosis has still an unknown mechanism of proliferation and its clinical behavior or progression is highly unpredictable. Severe uropathy is commonly related to direct ureteral involvement, but can also depend on an ab-extrinseco compression by large, rapidly growing endometriomas. Women at risk of endometriosis, who are not receiving empirical medical treatment, should be adequately and regularly assessed via pelvic ultrasonography and/or submitted to diagnostic laparoscopy in order to prevent serious consequences such as silent renal loss."

Even when gynecologic disease is suspected, the vagina may be underevaluated at routine pelvic US due to probe positioning and at CT due to poor vaginal tissue characterization. Although MR imaging offers excellent tissue characterization, radiologists must focus on the vaginal area to recognize any incidental findings. A directed anatomic-pathologic approach to assessing the vagina at US, CT, and MR imaging is recommended so that pertinent findings are not missed. This approach requires a knowledge of the anatomy and embryologic development of the vagina, as well as an understanding of congenital, developmental, and postoperative vaginal disease entities. In addition, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of each imaging modality with respect to vaginal assessment. By remembering to ""look beyond"" the uterus and cervix to the vagina, radiologists can improve their perception and interpretation of vaginal anatomy and disease."

Successful pregnancy in a patient with radical vaginal trachelectomy is possible, with two-thirds of pregnancies resulting in live birth. However, it presents a great challenge for assisted reproductive techniques and reproductive medicine in cases with subsequent severe cervical stenosis. This is a report of a 38-year-old patient who underwent radical vaginal trachelectomy at the age of 33 years for early stage (IA2) adenocarcinoma and subsequently presented with infertility due to cervical factors. The patient underwent ovarian stimulation using a novel SMART (Stimulation with Minimal Adverse effects, Retrieval and Transfer)-IVF protocol. As it was impossible to perform transcervical embryo transfer with an almost absent severely stenotic cervical opening, a transmyometrial embryo transfer under ultrasound guidance was performed. This resulted in a successful singleton full-term pregnancy delivered by Caesarean section at gestational age 37 weeks. As far as is known, this is the first reported case of successful pregnancy conceived by IVF with transmyometrial embryo transfer for a patient who had previously undergone radical vaginal trachelectomy."

Participants were 136 normo-ovulatory women undergoing infertility work-up within 3 months of their first ovarian stimulation cycle for in vitro fertilization. On day 3 of a spontaneous menstrual cycle, a blood sample for measurement of plasma AMH levels was taken and a transvaginal ultrasound scan to determine the AFC (follicles measuring 2-5 mm in diameter) was performed. Information about smoking, body mass index, alcohol consumption, ethnic origin, chronological age, age at menarche, years since menarche and gravidity were recorded using a case report form. The main outcome measures were plasma AMH concentrations and total number of small antral follicles (AFC). Median plasma levels of AMH were 2.0 ng/ml (interquartile range 1.1-3.6) and AFC was 10 (interquartile range 7-15). A positive correlation between AMH and AFC (r = 0.54, p < 0.0001) was found. AMH and AFC correlated negatively with age (r = -0.30, p < 0.001 and r = -0.27, p = 0.001 respectively) and number of years since menarche (r = -0.23, p = 0.007 and r = -0.21, p = 0.015 respectively), but not with any of the other measures. Circulating AMH levels and AFC correlated with each other and declined significantly with age. There were only weak, non-significant, correlations with lifestyle factors and reproductive history. These putative markers could be used individually or together to assess the age-related decline of ovarian function in normo-ovulatory candidates for IVF."

The correlation between CT-based dosimetric parameters and clinical outcomes is also evaluated. Between 2002 and 2006, 10 medically inoperable patients with T1-2 endometrial carcinoma were treated with radiotherapy alone. A combination of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDR-ICBT) was used for 9 patients, and one was treated with HDR-ICBT alone. Dose prescription of HDR-ICBT was determined in reference to CT images at brachytherapy, and a total dose of 22-24 Gy in 4 fractions was delivered to the outer perimeter of the uterine corpus. Dose-volume parameters of the gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), and organs at risk were assessed retrospectively using the dose-volume histograms derived from the CT image-based treatment planning system. After a median follow-up of 55 months, 9 patients were alive without evidence of recurrence. One patient died from liver cirrhosis 17 months after radiotherapy. Severe acute and late toxicities were not observed in any of the patients. Average minimum dose to 90% of GTV and CTV (D90) was 88.0 and 45.9 Gy(EQD2), respectively. The minimum dose delivered to 2 cc of the most irradiated volumes of the rectum and sigmoid colon (D(2cc)) was 78.9 and 65.9 Gy(EQD2), respectively. These patients developed Grade 1 late complications. In this study, stage I-II endometrial carcinoma was well-controlled locally with minimum late toxicity by radiotherapy alone with HDR-ICBT. 3D image-based brachytherapy may potentially deliver a sufficiently high dose to the whole tumor without significant increase in dose to surrounding normal tissues."

It has brought about new technical advancements: the last generation robots offer a steady three-dimensional image, improved instrument dexterity and precision, higher ergonomics and comfort for the surgeon. The da Vinci robotic system has been used without evincing any specific morbidity in various cases, notably for tubal reanastomosis, myomectomy, hysterectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy or sacrocolpopexy amongst others. Robotic assistance in gynaecology is thus feasible. Like conventional laparoscopic surgery, it allows decreased blood loss and morbidity as well as shorter hospital stay, as compared to laparotomy. It might indeed allow many surgical teams to perform minimally invasive surgical procedures which they were not used to performing by laparoscopy. Randomized prospective studies are needed to define its indications more precisely. Besides, its medico-financial impact should be evaluated too."
CD011126,0,24861247,0,Imaging for the evaluation of endometriosis and adenomyosis.,"Endometriosis affects between 5 and 45% of women in reproductive age, is associated with significant morbidity, and constitutes a major public health concern. The correct diagnosis is fundamental in defining the best treatment strategy for endometriosis. Therefore, non-invasive methods are required to obtain accurate diagnoses of the location and extent of endometriotic lesions. Transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging are used most frequently to identify and characterise lesions in endometriosis. Subjective impression by an experienced sonologist for identifying endometriomas by ultrasound showed a high accuracy. Adhesions can be evaluated by real-time dynamic transvaginal sonography, using the sliding sign technique, to determine whether the uterus and ovaries glide freely over the posterior and anterior organs and tissues. Diagnosis is difficult when ovarian endometriomas are absent and endometriosis causes adhesions and deep infiltrating nodules in the pelvic organs. Magnetic resonance imaging seems to be useful in diagnosing all locations of endometriosis, and its diagnostic accuracy is similar to those obtained using ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasound has been proposed as first line-line imaging technique because it is well accepted and widely available. The main limitation of ultrasound concerns lesions located above the rectosigmoid junction owing to the limited field-of-view of the transvaginal approach and low accuracy in detecting upper bowel lesions by transabdominal ultrasound. A detailed non-invasive diagnosis of the extension in the pelvis of endometriosis can facilitate the choice of a safe and adequate surgical or medical treatment."
CD011126,0,24861246,0,Which imaging technique should we use in the follow up of gynaecological cancer?,"Follow-up routines after gynaecological cancer vary. The optimal approach is unknown, and no randomised-controlled trials comparing surveillance protocols have been published. In this chapter, we summarise the diagnostic performance of ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging in the follow up of women treated for ovarian or uterine cancers. Computed tomography is today the standard imaging method for the follow up of women treated for endometrial, cervical, or ovarian cancer. Six-monthly or annual follow-up examinations have not been shown to positively affect survival. Instead, a combination of transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound examination with clinical examination might be a more cost-effective strategy for early detection of recurrence. Positron-emission tomography might play a role in women with clinical or serological suspicion of recurrence but without evidence of disease at conventional diagnostic imaging. To create guidelines, more studies, preferably randomised-controlled trials, on follow-up strategies are needed."

Cervical cancer staging is based on clinical examination and histological findings. Many diagnostic methods are used in clinical practice. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered the optimal method for staging cervical carcinoma because of its high accuracy in assessing local extension of disease and distant metastases. Ultrasound has gained increased attention in recent years; it is faster, cheaper, and more widely available than other imaging techniques, and is highly accurate in detecting tumour presence and evaluating local extension of disease. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound are often used together with computed tomography or positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography to assess the whole body, a more accurate detection of pathological lymph nodes and metabolic information of the disease."
CD011126,0,11506090,0,Three-dimensional ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology.,"Three-dimensional ultrasound is a new modality finding its way into clinical practice. Most of the major ultrasound vendors are now developing three-dimensional ultrasound capabilities. We expect that although three-dimensional ultrasound will not replace two-dimensional ultrasound, many additional benefits will be identified and its use will continue to grow. The ability to evaluate anatomy and pathology with multiplanar and surface-rendered images provides physicians additional valuable clinical information. Volume data allows for a specific point in space to be evaluated from many different orienta tions by rotating, slicing, and referencing the slice to other orthogonal slices. It also allows for new volume-rendering displays that show depth, curvature, and surface images not available with conventional methods. The current limitations of image resolution, intuitive interfaces for obtaining and displaying optimal images, and technologic limitations for data storage and manipulation (including real-time three-dimensional ultrasound) will surely be overcome in the near future."

Eighty percent of CRs are associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS). TS is a rare multi-system disease, with autosomal dominant genetic transmission. If the parents of an affected child do not have features of TS, then either one parent is mosaic for the TS gene mutation or the affected child is the result of a de novo germline mutation. We present a case of a dizygotic twin pregnancy complicated by CRs in both fetuses at 24 weeks. Twin A died in utero at 28 weeks. Preterm labour and delivery of twin B occurred at 33 weeks. Twin B had multiple small CRs and a large apical CR. At six weeks after delivery, the CRs had disappeared or reduced in size. Regression in the third trimester or postnatally is the natural course of CRs. Molecular testing for TS identified two variants in the TSC2 gene. The parents were clinically unaffected; however, the father was subsequently found on an MRI of the head to have cortical tubers, and he was found to carry the pathogenic TSC2 mutation. Since dizygotic twin pregnancy is akin to two consecutive pregnancies, the etiology in our case is due to one parent having subclinical TS.

There were observed 54 children with gallbladder cholesterosis (GBC) aged from 1 year to 15 years (20 girls, 34 boys) . The diagnosis was confirmed histologically in the walls of GB. Gallbladder cholesterosis was differentiated from polyps and concrements of GB in the performance of traditional and endoscopic ultrasound. According to testimony performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdominal cavity. The material was processed statistically using a specially program developed by Medstat. Results. There were showed clinical course features and morphological picture of the gallbladder wall. There were brought the attention of pediatricians to the reversibility of the pathological process in childhood, which suggests alternative methods of treatment in gallbladder cholesterosis the in children--traditional treatment."

Experienced investigators will have an accuracy of more than 90%. Sonography can diagnose many conservatively managed diseases. The most important differential diagnoses are infectious ileocoecitis, right sided diverticulitis, appendagitis, adnexitis, ruptured or torque ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancies. Ureterolithiasis, cholecystitis, haematomas in the psoas muscle or in the rectus muscle are rarer causes of right lower quadrant pain. Sonography can reduce the high rate of false positive clinical examinations concerning acute appendicitis. It has to be stated that an exclusion of appendicitis can only be made sonographically if the normal appendix can be seen in its full length and/or an other differential diagnosis can be depicted that explains the clinical symptoms. Mucoceles are rare cystoid lesions of the appendix. They exhibit a typical onion skin sign structure caused by different mucus viscosities. In large mucoceles a tumor causes this lesion."
CD011126,0,18854104,0,Antral follicle count at down-regulation and prediction of poor ovarian response.,"The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of antral follicle count (AFC) performed after pituitary down-regulation (dAFC) in predicting poor ovarian response and the influence of using different thresholds of follicle size and count on its accuracy. Using three definitions of follicle size, three dAFC were determined for every patient in a consecutive cohort of 148 IVF cycles. The performance of the dAFC in predicting poor ovarian response (as expressed by area under the curve; AUC) for follicle size definitions of 2-5, 2-8, 2-10 mm, was not significantly different (AUC 0.80, 0.80, 0.79, respectively). Multilevel likelihood ratio for dAFC thresholds of <or=10, 11-15,16-20 and >20 were 5.43 (95% confidence interval 0.81-36.6), 3.06 (1.54-6.06), 1.63 (0.74-3.62) and 0.37 (0.19-0.75) with post-test probabilities of poor ovarian response of 50%, 36%, 23% and 6%, respectively, for a pretest probability of 15.5% for poor ovarian response. The single most important predictor of ovarian response was dAFC. The highest predictive performance was obtained in a model combining age and body mass index and dAFC (AUC = 0.82) showing only marginal improvement over dAFC alone. In conclusion, the performance of dAFC is the same regardless of the definition used for the size of antral follicles."

CD011126,0,14563611,0,[Endometrial surveillance of women on tamoxifen].,"Tamoxifen estrogenic action in the uterus induces several uterine diseases, benign and/or malignant ones. The risk of endometrial adenocarcinoma is multiplied by two to three in post-menopausal women. It is mainly linked with the doses and the length of the treatment. However, the global benefit of that drug is not questioned anymore. What matters now though is to find the best way to follow patients on tamoxifen. As a matter of fact, there is no such thing as a consensus that would include specific tests, nor a surveillance protocol in women on tamoxifen. Most teams do not propose any special follow-up. Some patients already show uterine anomalies prior to the beginning of tamoxifen treatment. A yearly gynecologic examination, together with a cervico-vaginal smear, is enough when there are no specific endometrial adenocarcinoma risk factors, nor anomalies detected during the pre-therapeutical evaluation, nor clinical symptomatology. In case of risk factors, or cervical stenosis, or again initial abnormalities though, a yearly transvaginal sonography may be proposed. There is no need for other exploratory examinations if the results are satisfying. In case of symptoms, anomalies in the cervico-vaginal smears, intra-uterine liquid retention with a stenosed cervix, or suspicious endometrial thickness, then an endometrial sampling must be carried out. MRI could be of interest in asymptomatic patients with unclear ultrasonography images. Follow-up must be continued after interruption of tamoxifen. It is important to inform patients about the additional risks of developing an endometrial cancer because of tamoxifen, while still being reassuring. Besides, it is absolutely necessary to recommend them to take quickly medical advice in case of gynecologic symptoms."

The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of two endometrial preparation groups, oral estradiol valerate tablets (OEV) group versus vaginal estradiol (VE) tablets group, in inadequate endometrium patients. This retrospective, single-center, cohort study of patients undergoing FET treatment between Jan. 2012 and Jun. 2013, at an academic IVF center, included 247 patients (cycles) with endometrial thickness < 8 mm on day 13 of the hormone replacement cycle: OEV group included 69 patients (cycles) who received continuous OEV from day 1 onwards up to the day of progesterone supplement, while VE group included 178 patients (cycles) who taken OEV from day 1 to day 12, and used VE tablets from day 13 till the day of progesterone supplement. Patients in VE group required more days and higher dosage of estradiol, but had thinner endometrium on the day of transfer. However, the increase of endometrial thickness was more, when compared to OEV-treated patients. The implantation rate and pregnancy rate were, though not significantly, higher in VE group."
CD011126,0,18396236,0,[Optimal evaluation of the infertile male. 2007 French urological association guidelines].,"An infertility evaluation should be performed if a couple has not achieved conception after one year of unprotected intercourse. An evaluation should be performed earlier if male or female infertility risk factors exist and if the couple questions its fertility potential. The initial screening of the male should include a reproductive history and a physical examination performed by a urologist or a specialist in male fertility and two semen analyses. Additional procedures and testing may be used to elucidate problems discovered during the full evaluation. The minimal initial endocrine evaluation should include serum total testosterone and serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels. An endocrine evaluation should be performed if sperm concentration is abnormally low, sexual function is impaired, and when other clinical findings suggest a specific endocrinopathy. A postejaculatory urinalysis should be performed if ejaculate volume is less than 1 mL, except in patients with bilateral vasal agenesis or possible hypogonadism. With a diagnosis of retrograde ejaculation, specific management should be considered before advising assisted reproductive technology. Scrotal ultrasonography is indicated when physical examination of the scrotum is difficult or inadequate, or when a testicular mass is suspected. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) is indicated in patients who are azoospermic or have a low ejaculate volume. Specialized testing of semen is not required for routine diagnosis of male infertility. However, some tests may be useful for a few patients to identify a male factor contributing to unexplained infertility, or to select therapy (e.g., assisted reproductive technology). Before performing intracytoplasmic sperm injection, karyotyping and Y-chromosome analysis should be offered to men who have nonobstructive azoospermia and severe oligospermia. Genetic testing for gene mutations of the ABCC7 (ex-CFTR) gene should be offered to male and female partners before proceeding with treatments that use the sperm of men with congenital bilateral absence of the vasa deferentia or congenital unilateral abnormality of the seminal tract. Genetic counseling may be offered when a genetic abnormality is suspected in the male or female partner, and it should be provided when a genetic abnormality is detected. Genetic testing in the female partner, when non symptomatic, should only be advised by a physician from a multidisciplinary team registered by the ministry of health. Evaluation by testis biopsy and deferentography should be performed by a urologist or an andrologist registered for sperm retrieval."

CD011126,0,16515564,0,Risk of malignancy index for referral of ovarian cancer cases to a tertiary center: does it identify the correct cases?,"Characterization of adnexal masses to identify patients with malignant ovarian tumors preoperatively for referral to a cancer center for treatment has been extensively studied. A simple algorithm called ""risk of malignancy index"" (RMI) reported by Jacobs incorporated the serum CA125 level, menopausal status, and ultrasound morphologic features. This algorithm has subsequently been tested on retrospective and prospective data with encouraging results. However, these studies did not include cases that had had both their serum CA125 measurements and ultrasound examinations from a diverse range of laboratories and sonographers. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the RMI algorithm for identifying cases of ovarian malignancy presenting at cancer units for subsequent referral to a cancer center. All cases of suspected ovarian malignancy referred to the Northern Gynaecological Oncology Centre (NGOC) during an 18-month period were identified from the NGOC database. A case note review was performed, and the following data were extracted: patient demographics, the referring physician and the operating surgeon, ultrasound morphology, serum CA125 levels, and menopausal status. All patients had their ultrasound performed by sonographers at the peripheral unit according to local protocols. A total of 182 patients with a pelvic mass were referred to the center for surgery. A total of 24% patients had benign tumors, 6% had tumors of borderline malignancy, and 70% had invasive tumors. A total of 145 cases had an RMI >200; 125 of these had ovarian or peritoneal cancers. An RMI >200 had a sensitivity of 88.5% for diagnosing invasive lesions. The overall sensitivity of this algorithm for diagnosing all borderline, invasive ovarian, or primary peritoneal lesions was 87.4%, and the positive predictive value was 86.8%. Our data confirm the effectiveness of the RMI algorithm in clinical practice for the identification and subsequent referral to cancer centers of cases of potential ovarian malignancy. We therefore recommend its continued use."

The initial assessment ruled out premature ovarian failure, polycystic ovary syndrome and led to suspect a hypothalamo-pituitary cause. However, the unusual hormone pattern with a very low level of FSH, normal levels of LH and estradiol, associated with a positive progesterone test suggested the presence of a FSH inhibiting factor: the unexpectedly high levels of inhibin B and AMH were suggestive of a granulosa cell tumor as showed by the radiologic findings. This prompted a surgical exploration, which confirmed the putative diagnosis. This case report illustrates the inhibin B and AMH values and the modern-day pelvic imaging data encountered in menstrual irregularities caused by a granulosa cell tumor."

CD011126,0,25336704,0,Ovarian reserve screening: a scientific and ethical analysis.,"Ovarian reserve (OR) screening of the general population is generally not advocated as it has not been conclusively established to reflect immediate potential for natural conception, while it may also potentially create anxiety for women. However, in this paper, we argue in support of screening of the general population for diminished OR. First, OR tests such as measurements of anti-Müllerian hormone and antral follicle count are predictive of the chances of IVF conception, and therefore predict a woman's total fertility potential (i.e. chances of natural and IVF-related conceptions). Since the requirement for assisted conception increases with age, this is an important point. Secondly, women identified as having low OR are at increased risk of early loss of fertility potential in the longer term, limiting their reproductive life span and the size of their family if they delay conception. Thirdly, women often disregard generic advice to avoid delaying conception beyond 30 years of age, yet studies suggest that personalized risk assessment tools such as OR testing can actually increase an individual's motivation for positive change. A poor OR screening test result is more likely to convince a woman to bring forward her plans for natural conception, or alternatively explore oocyte vitrification, at a stage when these approaches still have reasonable prospects of success. Finally, we believe that women have a right, based on the ethical concept of autonomy, to be made aware of OR screening, so that they themselves can determine if OR testing is useful in assisting them with reproductive life planning."
CD011126,0,23871392,0,[Granulosa cell tumor: difficulty of diagnosis and contribution of imaging].,"Granulosa tumors (GT) are rare neoplasms, difficult to diagnose in a preoperative stage. We report a set of seven patients affected by GT admitted in Amiens University Hospital, collated with a review of the literature (n=379). Our aim was to report the clinical and radiological characteristics of GT, in order to improve preoperative diagnosis. The average age of the subjects was 50.8 years old among the bibliographical search, and 37years old for the observations reported in Amiens. The principal circumstances of diagnosis were vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain and infertility. Ultrasound was the most frequently investigation, revealing GT as a large unilateral solid and cystic mass. The computed tomodensitometry (CT) allowed to precise the locoregional extension. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) appeared to be interesting to clarify lesions, showing GT as a solid mass with a cystic component or as a multicystic mass. Hormonal assays (inhibin B and/or anti-Müllerian hormone) can provide valuable assistance in diagnosis, despite their cost and lack of availability. In view of the clinical and radiological presentation of the reported and literature review cases, we suggest hormonal assays among perimenopausal women presenting with an unusual radiological aspect of an annexial mass."

CD011126,0,23375989,0,[Management of patients with a history of late abortion or very premature delivery].,"Patients have a very late abortion or premature delivery in 2-3 % of pregnancies. Management in a subsequent pregnancy should seek an infection, a fetal cause (aneuploidy, malformation syndrome, intrauterine death) or vascular pathology (preeclampsia, IUGR, intrauterine death). In women with a late abortion or very premature childbirth history, several preventive treatments of prematurity are now available. The main cause of prematurity is ascending infection from the vagina. Cerclage or pessary is designed to better isolate the uterine cavity. Their effectiveness has been validated in patients for whom the repeated measurement of cervical length by transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length <25mm. Early pregnancy vaginosis and treatment with Dalacin(®) seem to significantly reduce the risk of prematurity. Finally, the routine administration of intramuscular or vaginal progesterone at the beginning of the 2(nd) quarter also proved effective in several randomized studies."

CD011126,0,19079963,0,Endometrial sonographic characters predicting pregnancy following recurrent clomiphene induction in unexplained infertility.,"Patients with unexplained infertility managed repeatedly with clomiphene citrate need parameters to predict pregnancy to save them further unsuccessful trials and shorten their treatment to pregnancy interval. Ovulation was induced in 226 unexplained infertility patients, who had three previous failed cycles, with 100 mg clomiphene citrate (CC) from days 3 to 7 of the cycle. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) injection (10,000 IU i.m.) was given and timed intercourse was recommended when a leading follicle reached >17 mm and serum oestradiol exceeded 200 pg/ml. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that endometrial thickness >11.60 mm was associated with the lowest, while values >5.50 mm were associated with the highest chance of pregnancy. An endometrial thickness of 7.05 mm showed the best sensitivity and specificity. Patients with endometrial thickness <7.05 mm (n = 98) had significantly more clinical pregnancies (28.6 versus 8.9%), fewer days until HCG injection, thicker endometrium, higher serum progesterone measured on days 20-22 and more triple layer endometria than patients with endometrial thickness > or =7.05 mm (n = 56). It is concluded that endometrial thickness range of 5.50-8.25 mm and triple layer endometrium are highly predictive for pregnancy in patients with unexplained infertility induced with CC after repeated failures. Endometrial thickness of 11.60 mm was associated with a low chance of pregnancy."

CD011126,0,22928752,0,Testicular microlithiasis is not a risk factor for the production of antisperm antibody in infertile males.,"Testicular microlithiasis (TM) is a pathological event characterised by the presence of microliths within the testicular entities, and such calcium deposition is thought to have deleterious impacts on the structure of blood-testis barrier (BTB). Breaches in the BTB appear to be a risk factor for antisperm antibody (ASA) production, which is reported to have negative influence on human fertility. Thus, the theories are provocative that ASA formation is elicited in TM men, and the resultant ASA will accordingly affect the fecundity in these men. To illustrate these hypotheses, this study enrolled 22 infertile men incidentally diagnosed with TM by testicular ultrasound evaluation. Sperm samples were collected, and direct immunobead test was used to determine the ASA levels. None of the infertile men with TM were found to display significant levels of ASA, whilst relatively abnormal sperm parameters in these cases were revealed by semen analysis. These observations suggest that TM exposure does not increase the risk of ASA production in infertile men, and therefore, ASA is discarded as an active participant in the development of infertility in TM men. Nevertheless, disrupted spermatogenesis resulting from TM may, at least in part, have certain implications for the pathogenesis of TM-associated infertility."

Here the techniques are adapted for a non-cancer patient. In 1999, right oophorectomy was performed in a 21 year old woman before chemotherapy, prior to bone marrow transplantation. Ovarian cortex was frozen, according to a strict protocol. After thawing, ovarian cortex was reimplanted into the ovary and in a peritoneal window close to the ovary in 2004. Four-and-a-half months after reimplantation, LH, FSH, 17beta-estradiol and progesterone levels, as well as ultrasonography, demonstrated the presence of an ovulatory cycle. After this cycle, the patient experienced two other ovulatory cycles, evidenced by FSH and 17beta-estradiol concentrations, as well as ultrasound demonstration of a follicle. Follicular development was clearly observed in both the intraovarian site (1st and 2nd cycle) and the peritoneal window (3rd cycle). Restoration of endocrine ovarian function occurred after ovarian cortical strips, biopsied and cryopreserved before chemotherapy, were reimplanted into the ovary itself and a periovarian peritoneal window."

VSCC arises from vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), which is diagnosed through painful punch biopsy. In this study, optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to differentiate between normal and VIN tissue. We hypothesize that (a) epidermal layer thickness measured in OCT images is different in normal tissue and VIN, and (b) quantitative analysis of the attenuation coefficient (μoct) extracted from OCT data differentiates VIN from normal vulvar tissue. Twenty lesions from 16 patients are imaged with OCT. Directly after data acquisition, a biopsy is performed. Epidermal thickness is measured and values of μoct are extracted from 200 OCT scans of normal and VIN tissue. For both methods, statistical analysis is performed using Paired Mann-Whitney-test. Correlation between the two methods is tested using a Spearman-correlation test. Both epidermal layer thickness as well as the μoct are different between normal vulvar tissue and VIN lesions (p < 0.0001). Moreover, no correlation is found between the epidermal layer thickness and μoct. This study demonstrates that both the epidermal thickness and the attenuation coefficient of vulvar epithelial tissue containing VIN are different from that of normal vulvar tissue."

CD011126,0,21526198,0,Differential expressions of adhesive molecules and proteases define mechanisms of ovarian tumor cell matrix penetration/invasion.,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is an aggressive and deadly disease and understanding its invasion mechanisms is critical for its treatment. We sought to study the penetration/invasion of ovarian tumor cells into extracellular matrices (ECMs) using a fibroblast-derived three-dimensional (3D) culture model and time-lapse and confocal imaging. Twelve ovarian tumor cells were evaluated and classified into distinct groups based on their ECM remodeling phenotypes; those that degraded the ECM (represented by OVCAR5 cells) and those that did not (represented by OVCAR10 cells). Cells exhibiting a distinct ECM modifying behavior were also segregated by epithelial- or mesenchymal-like phenotypes and uPA or MMP-2/MMP-9 expression. The cells, which presented epithelial-like phenotypes, penetrated the ECM using proteases and maintained intact cell-cell interactions, while cells exhibiting mesenchymal phenotypes modified the matrices via Rho-associated serine/threonine kinase (ROCK) in the absence of apparent cell-cell interactions. Overall, this study demonstrates that different mechanisms of modifying matrices by ovarian tumor cells may reflect heterogeneity among tumors and emphasize the need to systematically assess these mechanisms to better design effective therapies."

CD011126,0,25714302,0,The clinical impact of gynecologic MRI.,"OBJECTIVE. This study assessed the clinical impact of pelvic MRI performed after the diagnosis of an indeterminate pelvic mass on ultrasound or CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The radiologic records of 567 patients who underwent pelvic MRI at our hospital from 2004 to 2006 were reviewed. Of these patients, 214 patients underwent pelvic MRI for evaluation of a gynecologic mass detected on a preceding ultrasound or CT examination; this group of patients constituted the basis of our study. The imaging and clinical records from the database were used for our analysis. The medical records were reviewed for the impact of the radiologic findings on patient treatment, and the results were tabulated for the findings of the first modality, whether the first modality provided a diagnosis, what management plan would be made according to the first modality, and what management plan would be made as a result of the MRI. The adequacy of the imaging study was assessed on the basis of either obtaining an accurate exact diagnosis or ascertaining at the minimum whether the mass was benign or malignant. Further endpoints included specificity and sensitivity of the individual modalities in the diagnosis of a specific gynecologic mass and whether clinical management was altered. Exact binomial CIs were computed for individual proportions. RESULTS. The clinical management of the patient was altered as a result of MRI in 77% of the cases (CI = 0.70-0.82). Surgery was avoided in 36% (CI = 0.29-0.43), and surgery was changed to a more appropriate method (laparoscopy vs laparotomy, involvement or not of a gynecologic oncologist) in an additional 17% (CI = 0.12-0.23). CONCLUSION. Without having undergone MRI, many of the women and girls in this study would have undergone unnecessary surgery; a more costly type of surgery; or long-term follow-up with the associated financial costs, personal and physical costs, and mental costs from the resultant anxiety of an unresolved indeterminate mass."

Only three pediatric cases have been described in the literature up to now. Honeycomb gallbladder has been described in two adult patients; no patients have been reported in childhood until now. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first case of adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder which resembled honeycomb, in a 9-year-old girl presented with recurrent abdominal pain.

CD011126,0,24053355,0,"First three-dimensional structure of Toxoplasma gondii thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase: insights for catalysis, interdomain interactions, and substrate channeling.","Most species, such as humans, have monofunctional forms of thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) that are key folate metabolism enzymes making critical folate components required for DNA synthesis. In contrast, several parasitic protozoa, including Toxoplasma gondii , contain a unique bifunctional thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR) having the catalytic activities contained on a single polypeptide chain. The prevalence of T. gondii infections across the world, especially for those immunocompromised, underscores the need to understand TS-DHFR enzyme function and to find new avenues to exploit for the design of novel antiparasitic drugs. As a first step, we have solved the first three-dimensional structures of T. gondii TS-DHFR at 3.7 Å and of a loop truncated TS-DHFR, removing several flexible surface loops in the DHFR domain, improving resolution to 2.2 Å. Distinct structural features of the TS-DHFR homodimer include a junctional region containing a kinked crossover helix between the DHFR domains of the two adjacent monomers, a long linker connecting the TS and DHFR domains, and a DHFR domain that is positively charged. The roles of these unique structural features were probed by site-directed mutagenesis coupled with presteady state and steady state kinetics. Mutational analysis of the crossover helix region combined with kinetic characterization established the importance of this region not only in DHFR catalysis but also in modulating the distal TS activity, suggesting a role for TS-DHFR interdomain interactions. Additional kinetic studies revealed that substrate channeling occurs in which dihydrofolate is directly transferred from the TS to DHFR active site without entering bulk solution. The crystal structure suggests that the positively charged DHFR domain governs this electrostatically mediated movement of dihydrofolate, preventing release from the enzyme. Taken together, these structural and kinetic studies reveal unique, functional regions on the T. gondii TS-DHFR enzyme that may be targeted for inhibition, thus paving the way for designing species specific inhibitors."

The aim was to compare results obtained with two different analog formulations. 42 patients were randomly assigned to receive either intranasal buserelin, preceded by a short period of subcutaneous injections (500 micrograms thrice daily for 10 days) or subcutaneous goserelin. Treatment was always started in the luteal phase. Response to therapy was evaluated through periodic clinic, endocrine and echotomographic controls. There were no significative differences in fibroid reduction between the two treatment groups.

Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the ""pure vision"" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas.

CD011126,0,19811993,0,Fast computation of the acoustic field for ultrasound elements.,"A fast method for computing the acoustic field of ultrasound transducers is presented with application to rectangular elements that are cylindrically focused. No closed-form solutions exist for this case but several numerical techniques have been described in the ultrasound imaging literature. Our motivation is the rapid calculation of imaging kernels for physics-based diagnostic imaging for which current methods are too computationally intensive. Here, the surface integral defining the acoustic field from a baffled piston is converted to a 3-D spatial convolution of the element surface and the Green's function. A 3-D version of the overlap-save method from digital signal processing is employed to obtain a fast computational algorithm based on spatial Fourier transforms. Further efficiency is gained by using a separable approximation to the Green's function through singular value decomposition and increasing the effective sampling rate by polyphase filtering. The tradeoff between accuracy and spatial sampling rate is explored to determine appropriate parameters for a specific transducer. Comparisons with standard tools such as Field II are presented, where nearly 2 orders of magnitude improvement in computation speed is observed for similar accuracy."
CD011126,0,19325052,0,Secondary tumors and tumorlike lesions of the peritoneal cavity: imaging features with pathologic correlation.,"Tumors and tumorlike lesions that secondarily involve the mesothelial or submesothelial layers of the peritoneum are a diverse group of disorders that range in biologic behavior from benign to highly malignant. The anatomy of peritoneal ligaments and mesenteries and the normal circulation of peritoneal fluid dictate location and distribution of these diseases within the peritoneal cavity. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the most common secondary tumor to affect the peritoneal cavity. When it arises from carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract or ovary, the prognosis is grave. However, when low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix spreads to the peritoneal cavity, the consequence is typically pseudomyxoma peritonei, which is a clinical syndrome, characterized by recurrent and recalcitrant voluminous mucinous ascites due to surface growth on the peritoneum without significant invasion of underlying tissues. Carcinomas from elsewhere in the body, as well as lymphomas and sarcomas, may also produce diffuse peritoneal metastasis. Granulomatous peritonitis is the consequence of disseminated infection such as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis, foreign materials, or rupture of a tumor or hollow viscus. Finally, a group of benign miscellaneous conditions that range from common disorders such as endometriosis and splenosis to very rare conditions such as gliomatosis peritonei and melanosis may also affect the peritoneum diffusely. Secondary tumors and tumorlike lesions of the peritoneum have overlapping imaging features when compared with each other and primary peritoneal tumors. Knowledge of peritoneal anatomy, normal fluid circulation within the peritoneal cavity, and clinical and pathologic features of secondary peritoneal lesions is essential for identification of these lesions."

The 3-D sonographic volume-determination of PVR with both methods correlated significantly with the actual amount of PVR by the catheter. The accuracy of both 3-D US volumetric methods was significantly higher under 300 mL of PVR. Bland-Altman plots were generated to examine limits of agreement. Both noninvasive 3-D sonographic methods are appropriate for the correct volume-determination of PVR following radical hysterectomy. Thus, we may avoid routine, albeit often unnecessary, catheterization to measure postoperative residual bladder volumes and subsequently the incidence of lower urinary tract infection may be reduced and better postoperative comfort for patients may be permitted."

A solution containing MRI contrast paramagnetic iron oxide particles was used to demark the skin surface scar tissue on the treatment planning MR images. During treatment, the focused ultrasound energy was steered around the scar based on its enhanced visual location. After the treatment, contrast enhanced MR images were acquired for immediate results evaluation. Adverse events and fibroid related symptoms were captured during the 6-months follow up period. All the women were treated with no complications. No episodes of skin burns, ulceration or skin redness were reported. The post-treatment contrast-enhanced MR images showed an average fibroid non-perfused volume ratio of 64%. At their 6-month follow-up, 92% of the patients reported a clinical improvement.

CD011126,0,24587629,0,"Endoscopic papillectomy: indications, techniques, and results.","Endoscopic papillectomy (EP) is currently accepted as a viable alternative therapy to surgery in sporadic ampullary adenoma and has been reported to have high success and low recurrence rates. At present, the indications for EP are not yet fully established. The accepted criteria for EP include size (up to 5 cm), no evidence of intraductal growth, and no evidence of malignancy on endoscopic findings (ulceration, friability, and spontaneous bleeding). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the imaging modality of choice for local T staging in ampullary neoplasms. Data reported in the literature have revealed that linear EUS is superior to helical computed tomography in the preoperative assessment of tumor size, detection of regional nodal metastases and detection of major vascular invasion. Endoscopic ampullectomy is performed using a standard duodenoscope in a similar manner to snare polypectomy of a mucosal lesion. There is no standardization of the equipment or technique and broad EP methods are described. Endoscopic ampullectomy is considered a ''high-risk'' procedure due to complications. Complications of endoscopic papillectomy can be classified as early (pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and cholangitis) and late (papillary stenosis) complications. The appropriate use of stenting after ampullectomy may prevent post-procedural pancreatitis and papillary stenosis. Tumor recurrence of benign lesions occurs in up to 20% of patients and depends on tumor size, final histology, presence of intraductal tumor, coexisting familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and the expertise of the endoscopist. Recurrent lesions are usually benign and most can be retreated endoscopically."
CD011126,0,15310105,0,[Splenosis and pelvic pain. A report of a case and literature review].,"Initially described by Buchbinder and Lipkoff in 1929, esplenosis is the transplant of the splenic heterotopy weave in the abdominal cavity. It is observed after the splenic traumatic rupture and appendectomy. It occurs also during the embryonic development. The most frequent places where it takes place are: the intrathoraxic cavity, intraperitoneal, retroperitoneo, and brain. Although the presence of this ectopic splenic weave is symptomatic, this pathology can be evident by pain in the pelvis or it can be confused with other pathologies such as hemangiomas of intestine, and endometriosis including metastasis carcinoma. It is impossible to predict which patients will develop the splenosis after the splenic trauma. The time of rupture or damage of the splectonomy and the amount of blood in the peritoneal cavity are not related with the number of implants. The symptoms are the clue. When the splenosis is diagnosed incidentally in a symptomatic patient, the complete surgery removal is not indicated. However this surgery is recommended when the abdominal pain or the diagnosis is uncertain. In this paper a case with a secondary pelvic pain, probably due to a tubaric abortion, agreeing with secondary splenosis and a traumatic splenic rupture, is reported."

To accomplish this, 45 infertile patients with type 2 DM and symptomatic DN were selected. Twenty healthy fertile men and 20 patients with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia without DM represented the control groups. DM patients were arbitrarily divided into three groups according to glycaemic control level (A=glycosylated haemoglobin <7%; B=glycosylated haemoglobin between 7% and 10%; C=glycosylated haemoglobin >10%). Patients underwent prostate-vesicular transrectal ultrasonography and sperm analysis. The following SV ultrasound parameters were recorded: (i) body antero-posterior diameter (APD); (ii) fundus APD; (iii) parietal thicknesses of the right and left SVs; and (iv) the number of polycyclic areas within both SVs. We then calculated the following parameters: (i) fundus/body (F/B) ratio; (ii) difference of the parietal thickness between the right and the left SV; and (iii) pre- and post-ejaculatory APD difference. All DM patients had a higher F/B ratio compared to controls (P<0.05). Group C had a higher F/B ratio compared to the other DM groups (P<0.05). All DM patients had a lower pre- and post-ejaculatory difference of the body SV APD compared to controls (P<0.05). Groups A and B had a similar pre- and post-ejaculatory difference of the body SV APD, whereas this difference was lower in Group C (P<0.05). In conclusion, infertile DM patients with DN showed peculiar SV ultrasound features suggestive of functional atony, and low glycaemic control was associated with greater expression of these features."

A series of benchtop tests were conducted to validate multiple performance characteristics of the integrated dynamic near infrared/ultrasound breast imaging system (idNIRUS), including the reconstruction of the absorptive heterogeneities and the generation of the dynamic compression stimuli. In absorptive heterogeneity testing, we reconstructed the absorption coefficients of transparent polypropylene tubing circulated with a skim milk-India ink mixture and embedded in a gel wax tissue simulating phantom. High linear correlations (R(2) greater than 0.989) were observed between the reconstructed and the measured absorption coefficients of the embedded tubing. In dynamic compression testing, five volunteer operators generated ten successive compression sessions by compressing the idNIRUS imager on a breast self examination wearable model following the computer simulated pressure profile. The manually generated pressure profiles demonstrated an accuracy of 95.7% and operator-dependent variation of less than 5%.

Several patterns of 'abnormality' described on imaging have been linked to adenomyosis, but the correlation is weak and the diagnostic accuracy is low outside of a research context. Nevertheless, thickening or abnormality of the subendometrial myometrium, the outer part of the 'endometrial-subendometrial myometrium unit' (thought to be important in human fertility) has been repeatedly documented on imaging, called 'adenomyosis' and linked to infertility. This paper discusses the value of the physiological endometrial-subendometrial myometrium unit in human fertility, reviews the current criteria for its imaging, and reports on its relationship to fertility. It is proposed that endometrial-subendometrial myometrium unit disruption disease is considered as a new entity (distinguished from adenomyosis), the diagnosis of which is feasible and straightforward on imaging and expressed mainly by pathological thickening or abnormality of the subendometrial myometrium (myometrial halo or junctional zone). The study also reports on the influence of abnormal thickening or disruption on human fertility and outcome of assisted reproduction techniques, and demonstrates that this new entity is epidemiologically different from adenomyosis."

CD011126,0,24912816,0,An engineered 3D human airway mucosa model based on an SIS scaffold.,"To investigate interrelations of human obligate airway pathogens, such as Bordetella pertussis, and their hosts test systems with high in vitro/in vivo correlation are of urgent need. Using a tissue engineering approach, we generated a 3D test system of the airway mucosa with human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (hTEC) and fibroblasts seeded on a clinically implemented biological scaffold. To investigate if hTEC display tumour-specific characteristics we analysed Raman spectra of hTEC and the adenocarcinoma cell line Calu-3. To establish optimal conditions for infection studies, we treated human native airway mucosa segments with B. pertussis. Samples were processed for morphologic analysis. Whereas our test system consisting of differentiated epithelial cells and migrating fibroblasts shows high in vitro/in vivo correlation, hTEC seeded on the scaffold as monocultures did not resemble the in vivo situation. Differences in Raman spectra of hTEC and Calu-3 were identified in distinct wave number ranges between 720 and 1662 cm(-1) indicating that hTEC do not display tumour-specific characteristics. Infection of native tissue with B. pertussis led to cytoplasmic vacuoles, damaged mitochondria and destroyed epithelial cells. Our test system is suitable for infection studies with human obligate airway pathogens by mimicking the physiological microenvironment of the human airway mucosa."
CD011126,0,20130873,0,Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of neonatal pyometrocolpos under local anesthesia.,"Hydrometrocolpos is an uncommon congenital disorder with cystic dilatation of the vagina and uterus that occurs as a result of accumulated secretions from the reproductive tract due to distal genital tract obstruction. Secondary infection may also occur, resulting in pyometrocolpos, a potentially lethal disease. Immediate drainage of the cystic mass in patients determined to have pyometrocolpos is required to prevent or treat uropathy and septicemia until definitive corrective surgery can be performed. We report an unusual cause of obstructive uropathy in three infants: pyometrocolpos due to lower genital tract atresia. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of the pyometrocolpos resulted in dramatically improved clinical and laboratory findings in these patients. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage under local anesthesia is a simple, minimally invasive, safe, and effective procedure that facilitates later successful corrective surgery and avoids the need for more complex drainage procedures."
CD011126,0,23278946,0,Rare case of primary peritoneal pregnancy infiltrated into the Gerota's fascia of the right kidney.,"A 33-year-old, gravida 3, para 2, woman was transferred to our hospital, with acute abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a cystic lesion accompanied by ring-enhancement between the liver and right kidney with fluid collection in the pelvic cavity. Serum hCG value was 3100 mIU/mL. Transvaginal sonography revealed a pseudo-gestational sac in a thickened endometrium. With a preoperative diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation, laparotomy was performed. Following careful removal of clots between the liver and right kidney that contained a gestational sac, continuous bleeding from a defect in the Gerota's fascia of the right kidney was noted. The postoperative course was uneventful and the serum hCG concentration decreased markedly. This case demonstrates that the Gerota's fascia is a possible site of ectopic pregnancy, and that CT can identify a pregnancy in the Gerota's fascia as well as in the liver and spleen."

CD011126,0,23103207,0,Prediction of scar integrity and vaginal birth after caesarean delivery.,"A statistically significant association with uterine rupture during a trial of labour after caesarean delivery was found in at least two studies for the following variables: inter-delivery interval (higher risk with short interval), birth weight (higher risk if 4000 g or over), induction of labour (higher risk), oxytocin dose (higher risk with higher doses), and previous vaginal delivery (lower risk). However, no clinically useful risk estimation model that includes clinical variables has been published. A thin lower uterine segment at 35-40 weeks, as measured by ultrasound in women with a caesarean hysterotomy scar, increases the risk of uterine rupture or dehiscence. No cut-off for lower uterine segment thickness, however, can be suggested because of study heterogeneity, and because prospective validation is lacking. Large caesarean hysterotomy scar defects in non-pregnant women seen at ultrasound examination increase the risk of uterine rupture or dehiscence in subsequent pregnancy, but the strength of the association is unknown. To sum up, we currently lack a method that can provide a reliable estimate of the risk of uterine rupture or dehiscence during a trial of labour in women with caesarean hysterotomy scar(s)."

CD011126,0,18853841,0,Emergency gynecologic imaging.,"Acute pelvic pain in the female patient can have myriad presentations and, depending on the diagnosis, profound consequences. In the pregnant patient with pelvic pain or bleeding, an ectopic pregnancy must be first excluded. Ultrasound is important in determining the size and location of the ectopic pregnancy, and presence of bleeding, which in turn helps guide treatment decisions. Subchorionic or subplacental bleeds in an intrauterine pregnancy may also present with vaginal bleeding with consequences dependent on gestational age and size of bleed. In the postpartum female suspected to have retained products of conception, sonographic findings may vary from a thickened endometrial stripe to an echogenic mass with associated marked vascularity, often mimicking an arterial-venous malformation. In the nonpregnant patient, early diagnosis and treatment of ovarian torsion can preserve ovarian function. Other causes of peritoneal irritation may also cause acute pelvic pain including a ruptured hemorrhagic cyst or ruptured endometrioma. When pelvic inflammatory disease is suspected, imaging is used to evaluate for serious associated complications including the presence of a tuboovarian abscess or peritonitis. While leiomyomas of the uterus are largely asymptomatic, a leiomyoma that undergoes necrosis, torsion or prolapse through the cervix may be associated with acute severe pain or bleeding. The imaging features of these and other important clinical entities in the female pelvis will be presented."

CD011126,0,21081882,0,Dosimetric comparison study between intensity modulated radiation therapy and three-dimensional conformal proton therapy for pelvic bone marrow sparing in the treatment of cervical cancer.,"The objective was to compare intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with 3D conformal proton therapy (3DCPT) in the treatment of cervical cancer. In particular, each technique's ability to spare pelvic bone marrow (PBM) was of primary interest in this study. A total of six cervical cancer patients (3 postoperative and 3 intact) were planned and analyzed. All plans had uniform 1.0 cm CTV-PTV margin and satisfied the 95% PTV with 100% isodose (prescription dose = 45 Gy) coverage. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were analyzed for comparison. The overall PTV and PBM volumes were 1035.9 ± 192.2 cc and 1151.4 ± 198.3 cc, respectively. In terms of PTV dose conformity index (DCI) and dose homogeneity index (DHI), 3DCPT was slightly superior to IMRT with 1.00 ± 0.001, 1.01 ± 0.02, and 1.10 ± 0.02, 1.13 ± 0.01, respectively. In addition, 3DCPT demonstrated superiority in reducing lower doses (i.e., V30 or less) to PBM, small bowel and bladder. Particularly in PBM, average V10 and V20 reductions of 10.8% and 7.4% (p = 0.001 and 0.04), respectively, were observed. However, in the higher dose range, IMRT provided better sparing (> V30). For example, in small bowel and PBM, average reductions in V45 of 4.9% and 10.0% (p = 0.048 and 0.008), respectively, were observed. Due to its physical characteristics such as low entrance dose, spread-out Bragg peak and finite particle range of protons, 3DCPT illustrated superior target coverage uniformity and sparing of the lower doses in PBM and other organs. Further studies are, however, needed to fully exploit the benefits of protons for general use in cervical cancer."

CD011126,0,21163508,0,Exvivo ultrasound attenuation coefficient for human cervical and uterine tissue from 5 to 10 MHz.,"Attenuation estimation and imaging in the cervix has been utilized to evaluate the onset of cervical ripening during pregnancy. This feature has also been utilized for the acoustic characterization of leiomyomas and myometrial tissue. In this paper, we present direct narrowband substitution measurement values of the variation in the ultrasonic attenuation coefficient in ex vivo human uterine and cervical tissue, in the 5-10 MHz frequency range. At 5 MHz, the attenuation coefficient values are similar for the different orientations of uterine tissue with values of 4.1-4.2 dB/cm, 5.1 dB/cm for the leiomyoma, and 6.3 dB/cm for the cervix. As the frequency increases, the attenuation coefficient values increase and are also spread out, with a value of approximately 12.6 dB/cm for the uterus (both parallel and perpendicular), 16.0 for the leiomyoma, and 26.8 dB/cm for the cervix at 10 MHz. The attenuation coefficient measured increases monotonically over the frequency range measured following a power law."
CD011126,0,16316848,0,Ovarian Leydig cell tumor in a peri-menopausal woman with severe hyperandrogenism and virilization.,"The authors report a case of Leydig cell tumor in a 46-year-old woman who first presented with severe clinical hyperandrogenism and associated complex medical history. Investigations revealed markedly raised serum concentrations of testosterone (28.3 nmol/l) and free androgen index (54.4), whereas sex hormone binding globulin, random cortisol, androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate concentrations were all within the normal range. Transabdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan of the pelvis and abdomen showed a slightly bulky right ovary, but no other abnormalities. An ovarian source of androgens was suspected and surgery was arranged. Following a three-year history of defaulting appointments due to agoraphobia, she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and intraoperative selective ovarian venous sampling. Histopathological examination revealed a 2 cm Leydig cell tumor within the right ovary. Successful intraoperative ovarian venous sampling demonstrated significantly elevated testosterone levels (>260 nmol/l) from the right ovarian vein. Hyperandrogenaemia normalized post-operatively. The patient showed significant regression of clinical signs and symptoms, including the anxiety disorder. Clinical presentation, biochemistry and imaging modalities should allow to detect androgen-secreting ovarian tumors, while selective venous sampling should be reserved for patients whom uncertainty remains. The present case confirms that androgen-secreting ovarian tumors represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. They have to be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe hyperandrogenism even in peri-menopausal women. Although selective venous sampling is of diagnostic value, however, its impact on future management should be considered on individual basis."
CD011126,0,16724357,0,Management of cancer gallbladder found as a surprise on a resected gallbladder specimen.,"Carcinoma gallbladder is associated with an overall 5-year survival rate reported less than 5% due to late diagnosis. Advent of ultrasound scanning may help in detecting gallbladder polyps and an early gallbladder cancer. Excellent 5-year survival (up to 100%) has been reported for Stage Ia disease and the survival has significantly improved for Stage Ib, II, and III if appropriate re-operation is carried out soon after the incidental detection of gallbladder cancer. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is contraindicated in the presence of gallbladder cancer. It is recommended to excise all laparoscopic port sites, at the time of re-operation. Re-operation for Stage II gallbladder cancer is associated with a 90-100% 3-year survival rate. Patients with Stage III and IV tumors also benefit from an extended cholecystectomy. Patients with bulky primary tumors without lymph node metastases (T4N0) seem to have a better prognosis than those with distant lymph node metastases, and should be treated aggressively. It is advantageous to perform the appropriate extent of surgery for gallbladder cancer at the initial operation. Heightened awareness of the presence of cancer and the knowledge of appropriate management are important. For patients whose cancer is an incidental finding on pathologic review, re-resection is indicated for all disease except Stage Ia. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy have not been found effective as an adjuvant or palliative therapy in gallbladder cancer."

This was a retrospective review of women with chronic pelvic pain ± infertility with preoperative pain mapping exam prior to laparoscopy (n = 97, 2006-7). Predictor variables (EVUS-assisted exam vs digital pelvic exam alone, for pain mapping) were coded as tender vs non-tender. Primary outcome was findings on laparoscopy (e.g. endometriosis or adhesions) and was coded as abnormal vs normal. We found that EVUS-assisted exam had greater sensitivity (0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.89) for abnormal laparoscopy compared with digital pelvic exam alone (0.58, 95% CI: 0.46-0.69) (McNemar's test, p < 0.001). Specificity was limited for both types of pain mapping (0.22, 95% CI: 0.08-0.44 for EVUS-assisted; and 0.39, 95% CI: 0.20-0.61 for digital), with no significant difference (p = 0.13).

CD011126,0,15543800,0,Registration of central paths and colonic polyps between supine and prone scans in computed tomography colonography: pilot study.,"Computed tomography colonography (CTC) is a minimally invasive method that allows the evaluation of the colon wall from CT sections of the abdomen/pelvis. The primary goal of CTC is to detect colonic polyps, precursors to colorectal cancer. Because imperfect cleansing and distension can cause portions of the colon wall to be collapsed, covered with water, and/or covered with retained stool, patients are scanned in both prone and supine positions. We believe that both reading efficiency and computer aided detection (CAD) of CTC images can be improved by accurate registration of data from the supine and prone positions. We developed a two-stage approach that first registers the colonic central paths using a heuristic and automated algorithm and then matches polyps or polyp candidates (CAD hits) by a statistical approach. We evaluated the registration algorithm on 24 patient cases. After path registration, the mean misalignment distance between prone and supine identical anatomic landmarks was reduced from 47.08 to 12.66 mm, a 73% improvement. The polyp registration algorithm was specifically evaluated using eight patient cases for which radiologists identified polyps separately for both supine and prone data sets, and then manually registered corresponding pairs. The algorithm correctly matched 78% of these pairs without user input. The algorithm was also applied to the 30 highest-scoring CAD hits in the prone and supine scans and showed a success rate of 50% in automatically registering corresponding polyp pairs. Finally, we computed the average number of CAD hits that need to be manually compared in order to find the correct matches among the top 30 CAD hits. With polyp registration, the average number of comparisons was 1.78 per polyp, as opposed to 4.28 comparisons without polyp registration."

CD011126,0,24699352,0,Integration of 3D scale-based pseudo-enhancement correction and partial volume image segmentation for improving electronic colon cleansing in CT colonograpy.,"Orally administered tagging agents are usually used in CT colonography (CTC) to differentiate residual bowel content from native colonic structures. However, the high-density contrast agents tend to introduce pseudo-enhancement (PE) effect on neighboring soft tissues and elevate their observed CT attenuation value toward that of the tagged materials (TMs), which may result in an excessive electronic colon cleansing (ECC) since the pseudo-enhanced soft tissues are incorrectly identified as TMs. To address this issue, we integrated a 3D scale-based PE correction into our previous ECC pipeline based on the maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization partial volume (PV) segmentation. The newly proposed ECC scheme takes into account both the PE and PV effects that commonly appear in CTC images. We evaluated the new scheme on 40 patient CTC scans, both qualitatively through display of segmentation results, and quantitatively through radiologists' blind scoring (human observer) and computer-aided detection (CAD) of colon polyps (computer observer). Performance of the presented algorithm has shown consistent improvements over our previous ECC pipeline, especially for the detection of small polyps submerged in the contrast agents. The CAD results of polyp detection showed that 4 more submerged polyps were detected for our new ECC scheme over the previous one."

Fourty five patients with ovarian masses underwent ultrasonographic examination. These masses were given certain scores according to the different morphological features and were classified as benign and malignant. The sonographic findings were correlated with the histopathological reports. Of 45 patients, 31 had benign and 14 had malignant ovarian tumours. Ultrasonographic differentiation of benign and malignant ovarian tumours showed good results with a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 83.8%, and positive and negative predictive values of 70.5% and 92.8%, respectively. The result of the study was statistically significant (p = 0.00004). Among different features, thin (less than 3 mm) wall, smooth inner wall structure and anechogenicity or low echogenicity of the lesions were more reliable predictors of benignity. Highly echogenic lesions with solid component(s), without demonstrable and measurable wall and indistinct inner wall structure suggested malignancy.

The higher rate of multiple births among women having had ART can to some extent explain this. However, adverse outcomes persist even in ART singletons. The characteristics of the infertile parents have negative effects on the outcome, but also the hormone stimulation and the in vitro techniques are thought to play a role. A milder hormone stimulation and elective single embryo transfer, which reduces the number of multiples after ART, have improved the overall health of children born as a result of ART."
CD011126,0,19657814,0,Secondary amenorrhoea with high inhibin B level caused by parasitic ovarian leiomyoma.,"A 35-year-old patient attended the clinic after 1 year of primary infertility and 9 years secondary amenorrhoea. Her BMI was 21.9 kg/m². Transvaginal scan examination showed a small uterus with 1.7 mm thick endometrium. The left ovary was quiescent and measured 2.9 cm x 61.2 cm x 62.1 cm. 3D images manipulation showed a large (96.9 cm³) solid mass attached to the right ovary. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level was 3.8 IU/l, oestradiol was 57 pmol/l and testosterone was 0.9 nmol/l. She had normal thyroid indices, serum prolactin, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol levels. Inhibin B and luteinising hormone (LH) blood levels were high at 408 pg/ml and 19.5 IU/l, respectively. The mass was shelled laparoscopically off the right ovary, and proved histologically to be a parasitic leiomyoma. She resumed regular menstruation 1 month after surgery and conceived in her fourth cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case to be reported relating high inhibin B and luteinising hormone blood levels to an ovarian leiomyoma."

CD011126,0,24149138,0,Anti-Müllerian hormone and antral follicle count reveal a late impairment of ovarian reserve in patients undergoing low-gonadotoxic regimens for hematological malignancies.,"The impact of cancer therapy on the reproductive potential of patients is increasingly recognized because survival rates of patients have clearly improved in recent years. Different fertility preservation methods, either generally accepted or still experimental, are currently available, and counseling of patients requires a delicate balance between the efficacy and side effects of the proposed method and the characteristics of both the tumor and the therapy. Deeper knowledge of the effects of cancer therapy on the reproductive potential of patients over time is required to identify the most appropriate fertility preservation method. In this paper, we report a case-control study in which female patients who were diagnosed with hematological malignancies and treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were compared with age-matched controls in terms of ovarian reserve, as measured by ultrasound examination and hormonal status. By stratifying patients for gonadotoxicity of the therapy received and time elapsed from the end of the therapy, we report that patients treated with low gonadotoxic therapies, while being similar to age-matched controls in their ovarian reserve when evaluated within a few years from the end of the therapy, show a clear impairment over longer times. We also report that anti-Müllerian hormone is the most sensitive hormonal parameter in detecting changes in ovarian reserve when compared with follicle-stimulating hormone or inhibin-B. This study stresses the importance of accurate counseling at the time of diagnosis of cancer and emphasizes the risks of infertility with low gonadotoxic therapies that may reduce the reproductive window of survivors."
CD011126,0,21071192,0,An automated diagnostic system of polycystic ovary syndrome based on object growing.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder that seriously affects women's health. The disorder is characterized by the formation of many follicles in the ovary. Currently the predominant diagnosis is to manually count the number of follicles, which may lead to inter-observer and intra-observer variability and low efficiency. A computer-aided PCOS diagnostic system may overcome these problems. However the methods reported in recently published literature are not very effective and often need human interaction. To overcome these problems, we propose an automated PCOS diagnostic system based on ultrasound images."
CD011126,0,24288243,0,"Seminal, clinical and colour-Doppler ultrasound correlations of prostatitis-like symptoms in males of infertile couples.","'Prostatitis-like symptoms' (PLS) are a cluster of bothersome conditions defined as 'perineal and/or ejaculatory pain or discomfort and National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) pain subdomain score ≥4' (Nickel's criteria). PLS may originate from the prostate or from other portions of the male genital tract. Although PLS could be associated with 'prostatitis', they should not be confused. The NIH-CPSI is considered the gold-standard for assessing PLS severity. Although previous studies investigated the impact of prostatitis, vesiculitis or epididymitis on semen parameters, correlations between their related symptoms and seminal or scrotal/transrectal colour-Doppler ultrasound (CDU) characteristics have not been carefully determined. And no previous study evaluated the CDU features of PLS in infertile men. This study was aimed at investigating possible associations among NIH-CPSI (total and subdomain) scores and PLS, with seminal, clinical and scrotal/transrectal CDU parameters in a cohort of males of infertile couples. PLS of 400 men (35.8 ± 7.2 years) with a suspected male factor were assessed by the NIH-CPSI. All patients underwent, during the same day, semen analysis, seminal plasma interleukin 8 (sIL-8, a marker of male genital tract inflammation), biochemical evaluation, urine/seminal cultures, scrotal/transrectal CDU. PLS was detected in 39 (9.8%) subjects. After adjusting for age, waist and total testosterone (TT), no association among NIH-CPSI (total or subdomain) scores or PLS and sperm parameters was observed. However, we found a positive association with current positive urine and/or seminal cultures, sIL-8 levels and CDU features suggestive of inflammation of the epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostate, but not of the testis. The aforementioned significant associations of PLS were further confirmed by comparing PLS patients with age-, waist- and TT-matched PLS-free patients (1 : 3 ratio). In conclusion, NIH-CPSI scores and PLS evaluated in males of infertile couples, are not related to sperm parameters, but mainly to clinical and CDU signs of infection/inflammation."

CD011126,0,16243208,0,Emergency diagnostic paracentesis to determine intraperitoneal fluid identity discovered on bedside ultrasound of unstable patients.,"Patients presenting with hypotension may be evaluated with a FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) examination as recent literature has suggested its utility in the unstable patient. Those who are found to have intraperitoneal fluid on the FAST examination may have solid organ injury from unknown trauma, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hemorrhaging ovarian cyst, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or other disease process responsible for intra-periteal blood. However, because ultrasound does not assist in fluid identification, it is possible that the fluid present is not blood, but ascites. Further, a decision may need to be made regarding emergent surgical intervention or blood transfusion vs. aggressive fluid resuscitation or pressors followed by other testing such as computed tomography. This case series illustrates the utility of an ultrasound guided, emergent diagnostic paracentesis in the management of unstable patients found to have a positive FAST examination. Six unstable patients were evaluated with the FAST examination and found to have large quantities of intraperitoneal fluid. In each case the fluid was sampled and proposed management changed due to fluid identification."

CD011126,0,22045564,0,Ultrasound in the investigation of posterior compartment vaginal prolapse and obstructed defecation.,"Recent developments in diagnostic imaging have made gynecologists, colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists realize as never before that they share a common interest in anorectal and pelvic floor dysfunction. While we often may be using different words to describe the same phenomenon (e.g. anismus/vaginismus) or attributing different meanings to the same words (e.g. rectocele), we look after patients with problems that transcend the borders of our respective specialties. Like no other diagnostic modality, imaging helps us understand each other and provides new insights into conditions we all need to learn to investigate better in order to improve clinical management. In this review we attempt to show what modern ultrasound imaging can contribute to the diagnostic work-up of patients with posterior vaginal wall prolapse, obstructed defecation and rectal intussusception/prolapse. In summary, it is evident that translabial/perineal ultrasound can serve as a first-line diagnostic tool in women with such complaints, replacing defecation proctography and MR proctography in a large proportion of female patients. This is advantageous for the women themselves because ultrasound is much better tolerated, as well as for healthcare systems since sonographic imaging is much less expensive. However, there is a substantial need for education, which currently remains unmet."

CD011126,0,21397704,0,The relationship between cortical sulcal variability and cognitive performance in the elderly.,"The relationship between cognitive functions and brain structure has been of long-standing research interest. Most previous research has attempted to relate cognition to volumes of specific brain structures or thickness of cortical regions, with relatively few studies examining other features such as cortical surface anatomy. In this study, we examine the relationship between cortical sulcal features and cognitive function in a sample (N=316) of community-dwelling subjects aged between 70 and 90 years (mean=78.06±4.75; male/female=130/186) who had detailed neuropsychological assessments and brain MRI scans. Using automated methods on 3D T1-weighted brain scans, we computed global sulcal indices (g-SIs) of the whole brain and average sulcal spans of five prominent sulci. The g-SI, which reflects the complexity of sulcal folds across the cerebral hemispheres, showed a significant positive correlation with performance in most cognitive domains including attention/processing speed, memory, language and executive function. Regionally, a negative correlation was found between some cognitive functions and sulcal spans, i.e. poorer cognitive performance was associated with a wider sulcal span. Of the five cognitive domains examined, the performance of processing speed was found to be correlated with the spans of most sulci, with the strongest correlation being with the superior temporal sulcus. Memory did not show a significant correlation with any individual sulcal index, after correcting for age and sex. Of the five sulci measured, the left superior temporal sulcus showed the highest sensitivity, with significant correlations with performances in all cognitive domains except memory, after controlling for age, sex, years of education and brain size. The results suggest that regionally specific sulcal morphology is associated with cognitive function in elderly individuals."
CD011126,0,18465076,0,"Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in relation to POPQ, ordinal stages and ultrasound prolapse assessment.","Adequate staging of pelvic organ prolapse is important in clinical practice and research. The ability of the POPQ, ordinal stages and ultrasound prolapse assessment were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between women with and without prolapse symptoms. The leading edge of the predominant compartment in the three assessment systems was used for the calculation of receiver operating characteristics curves. Two hundred and sixty five (265) consecutive women were evaluated. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the three staging systems ranged from 0.715 to 0.783. POPQ staging and ordinal staging performed equally well in the prediction of prolapse symptoms (p = 0.780), and both performed better as compared with ultrasound prolapse assessment (p = 0.048 and p = 0.015, respectively). Prolapse staging can equally be performed by the POPQ and ordinal stages systems as far as the discrimination between women with and without prolapse symptoms is concerned. The ultrasound prolapse assessment does not perform better as compared with these two systems."

CD011126,0,20889422,0,Cellular polypropylene polymer foam as air-coupled ultrasonic transducer materials.,"Cellular polypropylene polymer foams, also known as ferroelectrets, are compelling candidates for air-coupled ultrasonic transducer materials because of their excellent acoustic impedance match to air and because they have a piezoelectric d(33) coefficient superior to that of PVDF. This study investigates the performance of ferroelectret transducers in the generation and reception of ultrasonic waves in air. As previous studies have noted, the piezoelectric coupling coefficients of these foams depend on the number, size, and distribution of charged voids in the microstructure. The present work studies the influence of these parameters both theoretically and experimentally. First, a three-dimensional model is employed to explain the variation of piezoelectric coupling coefficients, elastic stiffness, and dielectric permittivity as a function of void fraction based on void-scale physics and void geometry. Laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) measurements of the effective d(33) coefficient of a specially fabricated prototype transmitting transducer are then shown which clearly indicate that the charged voids in the ferroelectret material are randomly distributed in the plane of the foam. The frequency-dependent dynamic d(33) coefficient is then reported from 50 to 500 kHz for different excitation voltages and shown to be largely insensitive to drive voltage. Lastly, two ferroelectret transducers are operated in transmit-receive mode and the received signal is shown to accurately represent the corresponding signal generated by the transmitting transducer as measured using LDV."

CD011126,0,19509556,0,Influence of 2-(18F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography on recurrent ovarian cancer diagnosis and on selection of patients for secondary cytoreductive surgery.,"The objective of this prospective study was to compare the sensitivities and the specificities of combined 2-(F) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), abdominal/transvaginal ultrasound (US), and CT for diagnosing recurrent ovarian cancer (OC) and to evaluate the influence of PET/CT on referral of patients with solitary recurrence to secondary cytoreductive surgery. From April 2005 to November 2007, 60 patients were consecutively included to PET/CT 68 times. The inclusion criteria were remission of 3 months or longer and recurrent OC suspected from physical examination, US, or increasing cancer antigen 125 (CA125) level (>50 U/mL or >15% above baseline level). Recurrent OC was diagnosed 58 times in 52 patients. The sensitivities of US, CT, and PET/CT for diagnosing recurrence were 66% (P = 0.003), 81% (P = 0.0001), and 97% (P < 0.0001), respectively. The specificity of US, CT, and PET/CT for diagnosing recurrence was 90%. Positron emission tomography/CT diagnosed recurrence in 19 (66%) of 29 patients without recurrence according to US and in 10 (50%) of 20 patients without recurrence after CT. Multiple recurrent tumors were found using PET/CT in 27 (69%) of 39 patients with solitary tumors on US and in 8 (42%) of 19 patients with solitary tumors on CT. We conclude that the diagnostic value of PET/CT for detecting recurrent OC was higher than those of US and CT and that PET/CT more accurately identified patients with solitary recurrence. However, prospective clinical trials are needed to specify the characteristics of patients most likely to undergo complete secondary surgery and to further clarify the role of PET/CT in selecting patients for secondary surgery."

CD011126,0,21370039,0,Three-dimensional reconstruction of Trypanosoma brucei editosomes using single-particle electron microscopy.,"RNA editing within the mitochondria of kinetoplastid protozoa is performed by a multicomponent -macromolecular machine known as the editosome. Editosomes are high molecular mass protein assemblies that consist of about 15-25 individual polypeptides. They bind pre-edited transcripts and convert them into translation-competent mRNAs through a biochemical reaction cycle of enzyme-catalyzed steps. At steady-state conditions, several distinct complexes can be purified from mitochondrial detergent lysates. They likely represent RNA editing complexes at different assembly stages or at different functional stages of the processing reaction. Due to their low cellular abundance, single-particle electron microscopy (EM) represents the method of choice for their structural characterization. This chapter describes a set of techniques suitable for the purification and structural characterization of RNA editing complexes by single-particle EM. The RNA editing complexes are isolated from the endogenous pool of mitochondrial complexes by tandem-affinity purification (TAP). Since the TAP procedure results in the isolation of a mixture of different RNA editing complexes, the isolates are further subjected to an isokinetic ultracentrifugation step to separate the complexes based on their sedimentation behavior. The use of the ""GraFix"" protocol is presented that combines mild chemical cross-linking with ultracentrifugation. Different sample preparation protocols including negative staining, cryo-negative staining, and unstained cryotechniques as well as the single-particle image processing of electron microscopical images are described."

The aims of this study were to create an age-related normogram for AFC in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to compare age-related decline in AFC between infertile women with and without PCOS. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Of a total of 4956 women, 619 women fit criteria for PCOS. In those with PCOS, there were large variations in the AFC between the 10th and 90th percentiles in all age groups. The rate of decline in AFC among women with PCOS was linear, while in those with non-PCOS, it was exponential until 30 years of age, and then became similar to that of PCOS. The rate of follicle loss per year was significantly slower in PCOS women compared with that in non-PCOS women. In both groups, the fastest period of follicle loss was between the ages of 18 and 30. The average follicle loss was 0.8 follicles/year in PCOS women and 1.7 follicles/year in those without PCOS (P<0.001). This study concludes that age-related decline in AFC among women with PCOS is slower than in those without PCOS. Antral follicle count (AFC) has been shown to be a reliable marker for ovarian reserve.

CD011126,0,24225230,0,3D Reconstruction of virtual colon structures from colonoscopy images.,"This paper presents the first fully automated reconstruction technique of 3D virtual colon segments from individual colonoscopy images. It is the basis of new software applications that may offer great benefits for improving quality of care for colonoscopy patients. For example, a 3D map of the areas inspected and uninspected during colonoscopy can be shown on request of the endoscopist during the procedure. The endoscopist may revisit the suggested uninspected areas to reduce the chance of missing polyps that reside in these areas. The percentage of the colon surface seen by the endoscopist can be used as a coarse objective indicator of the quality of the procedure. The derived virtual colon models can be stored for post-procedure training of new endoscopists to teach navigation techniques that result in a higher level of procedure quality. Our technique does not require a prior CT scan of the colon or any global positioning device. Our experiments on endoscopy images of an Olympus synthetic colon model reveal encouraging results with small average reconstruction errors (4.1 mm for the fold depths and 12.1 mm for the fold circumferences)."

In fact, the stripping technique seems to be the most common technique used for ovarian cyst surgery. After stripping the cystic wall, the subsequent bleeding of the ovarian stromal wound ground is usually controlled by bipolar coagulation or/and by suturing. Potentially, the surgery-induced ovarian tissue damage will be increased by heat and/or by sutures. In respect to intraovarian hemostasis, the use of gelantine-thrombin-matrix might protect from additional ovarian tissue damage, which is of great importance for the ovarian reproductive function in woman. For the first time, our data do support a promising laparoscopic technique demonstrating ovarian cystectomy without any bipolar coagulation and/or suturing of ovarian tissue using a gelantine-thrombin-matrix sealant (FloSeal) as a new tool to control post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding."

An abdominal ultrasound showed mild to moderate right hydronephrosis due to obstruction, and computed tomography scan showed a bulky mass near the cervix, concerning for cervical or uterine malignancy. A Papanicolaou smear was suspicious for malignancy, and immunocytochemical stains were positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and cluster of differentiation (CD)-10, focally positive for CD34 and CD79a, and negative for CD3, CD20, and paired box protein-5 (PAX-5). Cervical biopsies showed an infiltrating population of cells with immunophenotype similar to the cells on cervical cytology. The cytologic and histologic workup was compatible with infiltration of the uterine cervix by recurrent precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy showed normocellular marrow without evidence of tumor or infiltrative disease. Complete blood count and peripheral blood smear showed no evidence of leukemic involvement. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed on cervical Pap smear has been very rarely reported. The majority of cases of hematologic malignancy involving the uterine cervix present with vaginal bleeding. To our knowledge, only three cases of recurrent precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the uterine cervix have been reported, two of which occurred in pediatric patients.

CD011126,0,22463047,0,Quantitative 3-D colocalization analysis as a tool to study the intracellular trafficking and dissociation of pDNA-chitosan polyplexes.,"Multichannel microscopy is frequently used to study intermolecular interactions and spatial relationships between biomolecules and organelles or vesicles in cells. Based on multichannel images, quantitative colocalization analysis can provide valuable information about cellular internalization, vesicular transport, and the intracellular kinetics and location of biomolecules. However, such analyses should be performed carefully, because quantitative colocalization parameters have different interpretations and can be highly affected by image quality. We use quantitative three-dimensional colocalization analysis of deconvolved and chromatic-registered confocal images to study the dissociation of double-labeled pDNA-chitosan polyplexes in HeLa cells and their colocalization with early endosomes. Two chitosans that form polyplexes with highly different transfection efficacies are compared. Pearson's correlation coefficient, Manders' colocalization coefficients, and the intensity correlation quotient are estimated to determine the intracellular localization of polyplexes, free pDNA, and free chitosans. Differences are observed in the amount of uptake, and in the intracellular pathways and rates of dissociation for the two chitosans. The results support previous findings that polyplexes formed by self-branched, glycosylated chitosan oligomers are more favorable for cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking to the nucleus compared with polyplexes formed by linear chitosans."
CD011126,0,20663578,0,Recommendations from Gynaecological (GYN) GEC-ESTRO Working Group: considerations and pitfalls in commissioning and applicator reconstruction in 3D image-based treatment planning of cervix cancer brachytherapy.,"Image-guided brachytherapy in cervical cancer is increasingly replacing X-ray based dose planning. In image-guided brachytherapy the geometry of the applicator is extracted from the patient 3D images and introduced into the treatment planning system; a process referred to as applicator reconstruction. Due to the steep brachytherapy dose gradients, reconstruction errors can lead to major dose deviations in target and organs at risk. Appropriate applicator commissioning and reconstruction methods must be implemented in order to minimise uncertainties and to avoid accidental errors. Applicator commissioning verifies the location of source positions in relation to the applicator by using auto-radiography and imaging. Sectional imaging can be utilised in the process, with CT imaging being the optimal modality. The results from the commissioning process can be stored as library applicators. The importance of proper commissioning is underlined by the fact that errors in library files result in systematic errors for clinical treatment plans. While the source channel is well visualised in CT images, applicator reconstruction is more challenging when using MR images. Availability of commercial dummy sources for MRI is limited, and image artifacts may occur with titanium applicators. The choice of MR sequence is essential for optimal visualisation of the applicator. Para-transverse imaging (oriented according to the applicator) with small slice thickness (< or =5 mm) is recommended or alternatively 3D MR sequences with isotropic voxel sizes. Preferably, contouring and reconstruction should be performed in the same image series in order to avoid fusion uncertainties. Clear and correct strategies for the applicator reconstruction will ensure that reconstruction uncertainties have limited impact on the delivered dose. Under well-controlled circumstances the reconstruction uncertainties are in general smaller than other brachytherapy uncertainties such as contouring and organ movement."

CD011126,0,15840903,0,"Hepatocyte growth factor prevents tissue fibrosis, remodeling, and dysfunction in cardiomyopathic hamster hearts.","Structural remodeling of the myocardium, including myocyte hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and dilatation, drives functional impairment in various forms of acquired and hereditary cardiomyopathy. Using cardiomyopathic Syrian hamsters with a genetic defect in delta-sarcoglycan, we investigated the potential involvement of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the pathophysiology and therapeutics related to dilated cardiomyopathy, because HGF has previously been shown to be cytoprotective and to have benefits in acute heart injury. Late-stage TO-2 cardiomyopathic hamsters showed severe cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis, accompanied by increases in myocardial expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), a growth factor responsible for tissue fibrosis. Conversely, HGF was downregulated in late-stage myopathic hearts. Treatment with recombinant human HGF for 3 wk suppressed cardiac fibrosis, accompanied by a decreased expression of TGF-beta1 and type I collagen. Suppression of TGF-beta1 and type I collagen by HGF was also shown in cultured cardiac myofibroblasts. Likewise, HGF suppressed myocardial hypertrophy, apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, and expression of atrial natriuretic polypeptide, a molecular marker of hypertrophy. Importantly, downregulation of the fibrogenic and hypertrophic genes by HGF treatment was associated with improved cardiac function. Thus the decrease in endogenous HGF levels may participate in the susceptibility of cardiac tissue to hypertrophy and fibrosis, and exogenous HGF led to therapeutic benefits in case of dilated cardiomyopathy in this model, even at the late-stage treatment."
CD011126,0,22085067,0,Cost-effectiveness of ultrasound use by on-call registrars in an acute gynaecology setting.,"Ultrasound, and in particular transvaginal sonography (TVS), plays an important role in the management of women with acute gynaecology conditions. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of two models of out-of-hours care for women in an acute gynaecology setting. In the ultrasound-based model, the on-call registrar with ultrasound experience managed such patients after performing pelvic ultrasound as a part of the initial assessment. On the other hand, in the traditional model of care the on-call registrar managed the patients without the use of ultrasound. The conclusion is that the use of ultrasound by the on-call registrars has significant cost implications through reduced hospital admissions. It leads to improved outcomes of such patients through timely diagnosis and treatment."

CD011126,0,19576858,0,Abnormal uterine and post-menopausal bleeding in the acute gynaecology unit.,"Abnormal uterine bleeding is one of the most common presentations in the acute gynaecology unit. The general principles of emergency care, including assessment of haemodynamic state, symptomatic relief as well as determination of underlying aetiology, apply to these women. We review different strategies in the diagnosis and investigation of abnormal uterine bleeding in both pre- and post-menopausal women. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) with colour Doppler is the cornerstone of initial management. TVS, in experienced hands, can reliably exclude the most common intra-cavitary pathologies including endometrial polyps and submucosal fibroids. Their exclusion, in pre-menopausal women, aids in the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. In post-menopausal women, the endometrial thickness reliably selects those who need further testing. If a thin and regular endometrium is visualised, malignancy is most unlikely. To allow for reliable evaluation of the endometrium, TVS has to be performed before endometrial sampling. Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) is most valuable in the detection of focal intra-cavitary lesions. TVS with or without SIS can provide enough information to avoid an unnecessary hysteroscopy. In this review, we will also discuss an evidence-based algorithm for the work-up of women with post-menopausal bleeding."

In a patient with no obvious local cause, the emphasis should be on uterine and adnexal evaluation. Based on a literature review, the evidence favours a conservative approach if the endometrial thickness (ET) is < 4mm, unless there are risk factors.

Advances in genetic engineering have facilitated extensive investigations to determine how changes in even a single peptide within a protein sequence can produce biomaterials with unique thermal, mechanical and biological properties. Elastin, a naturally occurring protein polymer, serves as a model protein to determine the relationship between specific structural elements and desirable material characteristics. The modular, repetitive nature of the protein facilitates the formation of well-defined secondary structures with the ability to self-assemble into complex three-dimensional architectures on a variety of length scales. Furthermore, many opportunities exist to incorporate other protein-based motifs and inorganic materials into recombinant protein-based materials, extending the range and usefulness of these materials in potential biomedical applications. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) can be assembled into 3-D architectures with precise control over payload encapsulation, mechanical and thermal properties, as well as unique functionalization opportunities through both genetic and enzymatic means. An overview of current protein-based materials, their properties and uses in biomedicine will be provided, with a focus on the advantages of ELPs.

The present study investigated the clinical significance of performing cystoscopy with prostate biopsy. Subjects were 458 patients who underwent cystoscopy and ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy from January 1998 to December 2004. Mean age of subjects was 71.3 years (range, 52-93 years). Prostate biopsy was performed modified Eskews systematic 5-region prostate biopsy (12 core). Some abnormalities were found in 43 of the 458 patients (9.3%).

The case report included a 53 years-old vaginal multipara, subject to transobturator tape procedure in 2004, who came to the observation of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (University of Catania, Italy) with a late vaginal polypropylene mesh erosion. She reported growing pain at her left leg, walking difficulty, fever and persistent stress urinary incontinence (SUI). She also described a shooting pain originating from the left inguinal ligament radiating down her left leg. Obturator internus and adducent muscles of the left thigh were involved. Ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clearly revealed the course of the mesh tape through the obturator muscles with myositis and abscess. The patient was treated by removing the polypropylene tape through the vaginal erosion. Her symptomatology improved within 3 weeks after the tape removal. Although developed to minimize surgical morbidity, the TOT procedure is not risk-free. Like for all the synthetic sling materials, the risk of erosion and resulting ascending infection from contamination exists. Because of the rarity of this complication, the Authors performed an assessment of this condition. Erosion may predispose the patient to secondary complications: abscess and myositis with great difficulty in deambulation. Imaging diagnosis is very effective. Ultrasound imaging is a useful method to investigate the whole pelvic floor condition. Moreover, MRI is a precise diagnostic procedure. This case not only proved the failure of the TOT for the treatment of stress incontinence, but also all the associated concerns. The study emphasizes the observation that abscess and symptomatic myositis may result into late disabling complications, although starting from a mini-invasive procedure."
CD011126,0,18277355,0,Evidence-based approach for the use of ultrasound in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy, affecting 5-10% of women in the reproductive age group, with a wide spectrum of phenotypes. The cardinal features are hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and/or polycystic ovary (PCO) appearance. Three major diagnostic criteria for PCOS have been proposed by the National Institute of Health (NIH 1990), the Rotterdam European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group (ESHRE/ASRM 2003) and the recent task force of the Androgen Excess Society (AES 2006). The PCO appearance is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of PCOS. The aim of this review was to assess the available evidence in order to highlight the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of PCOS. The evidence supports positive correlation between ultrasound features and biochemical indices of PCOS suggesting that ultrasound could play a role in prediction of PCOS severity and prognosis. Recent advances in ultrasonography resulted in a change of emphasis on the relative importance of total ovarian volume, follicle number and ovarian stromal changes in the diagnosis of PCO. In particular, ovarian stromal area/total area (S/A) ratio seems to have the most efficient diagnostic performance for hyperandrogenism. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound is a relatively new imaging modality that has the potential to improve the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound without adding much to the practical management of the syndrome. In addition to its role in the definition of PCO, ultrasound is helpful to predict fertility outcome in patients undergoing treatment."

CD011126,0,17935866,0,Volume segmentation and reconstruction from freehand three-dimensional ultrasound data with application to ovarian follicle measurement.,"This article presents a semi-automatic method for segmentation and reconstruction of freehand three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound data. The method incorporates a number of interesting features within the level-set framework: First, segmentation is carried out using region competition, requiring multiple distinct and competing regions to be encoded within the framework. This region competition uses a simple dot-product based similarity measure to compare intensities within each region. In addition, segmentation and surface reconstruction is performed within the 3D domain to take advantage of the additional spatial information available. This means that the method must interpolate the surface where there are gaps in the data, a feature common to freehand 3D ultrasound reconstruction. Finally, although the level-set method is restricted to a voxel grid, no assumption is made that the data being segmented will conform to this grid and may be segmented in its world-reference position. The volume reconstruction method is demonstrated in vivo for the volume measurement of ovarian follicles. The 3D reconstructions produce a lower error variance than the current clinical measurement based on a mean diameter estimated from two-dimensional (2D) images. However, both the clinical measurement and the semi-automatic method appear to underestimate the true follicular volume."

Endoscopic ultrasonography has various applications, such as staging of gastrointestinal malignancy, evaluation of submucosal tumors, and has grown to be an important modality in evaluating the pancreaticobiliary system. With regard to the biliary system, EUS is useful for the detection and staging of ampullary tumors, detection of microlithiasis and choledocholithiasis and evaluation of benign and malignant bile-duct strictures. Endoscopic ultrasonography may be used as an adjunct to transabdominal ultrasound for the detection and characterization of gallbladder polyps. In addition, EUS is helpful in the staging of gallbladder cancer as well as in diagnosing anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction with its associated pancreatobiliary diseases. The present paper reviews the current applications of EUS for imaging and intervention in diseases of the extrahepatic biliary system."

CD011126,0,24365202,0,FDG uptake heterogeneity in FIGO IIb cervical carcinoma does not predict pelvic lymph node involvement.,"Many types of cancer are located and assessed via positron emission tomography (PET) using the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) radiotracer of glucose uptake. There is rapidly increasing interest in exploiting the intra-tumor heterogeneity observed in these FDG-PET images as an indicator of disease outcome. If this image heterogeneity is of genuine prognostic value, then it either correlates to known prognostic factors, such as tumor stage, or it indicates some as yet unknown tumor quality. Therefore, the first step in demonstrating the clinical usefulness of image heterogeneity is to explore the dependence of image heterogeneity metrics upon established prognostic indicators and other clinically interesting factors. If it is shown that image heterogeneity is merely a surrogate for other important tumor properties or variations in patient populations, then the theoretical value of quantified biological heterogeneity may not yet translate into the clinic given current imaging technology."
CD011126,0,15668845,0,Ultrasound diagnosis of coexisting molar pregnancy following referral for abnormal serum screen.,"Complete hydatidiform mole and coexistent fetus is a rare occurrence. We report a case of a patient referred for abnormal serum screen and vaginal bleeding in the second trimester of pregnancy. Ultrasound revealed a cystic and solid mass along the posterior uterine wall with multiple hypoechoic (honeycomb) areas noted, consistent with molar degeneration of the placenta. Separate from this mass was a coexisting viable fetus with normal fetal anatomy and distinct anterior placenta. At delivery, a large cystic mass of placental tissue appeared to be implanted separately from a normal-appearing fetus and placenta. The mass weighed 184 g and contained multiple 1- to 1.5-cm cysts throughout. Microscopic sections revealed hydropic chorionic villi with central cistern formation and nonpolar trophoblastic hyperplasia with atypia, compatible with complete hydatidiform mole. This case illustrates that the diagnosis of coexisting molar pregnancy after referral for abnormal serum screen should be considered, especially if maternal serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is high and the patient has vaginal bleeding."

Existing technologies for thermal treatment of the cervix have limited spatial control or rapid energy falloff. The objective of this work is to develop an endocervical applicator using a linear array of multisectored tubular ultrasound transducers to provide 3-D conformal, locally targeted hyperthermia concomitant to radiotherapy in the uterine cervix.

CD011126,0,21701427,0,Diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding with imaging.,"The major role of ultrasound in the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding, other than that occurring during pregnancy, is in postmenopausal women. Because postmenopausal bleeding can be the presenting symptom of endometrial cancer, any woman with this symptom should be evaluated to diagnose or exclude carcinoma. Over the last two decades, the role of ultrasound in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding has changed markedly, from little or no role in 1990 to a major role today. In the intervening years, numerous studies have shown that ultrasound is at least as sensitive as endometrial biopsy for endometrial cancer and that ultrasound can reliably exclude cancer without the need for biopsy in some women with postmenopausal bleeding. In particular, numerous studies have shown that women with an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less have an extremely low likelihood of endometrial cancer and thus do not need to undergo endometrial biopsy. Ultrasound can also help in the selection of an appropriate biopsy technique. In a woman with postmenopausal bleeding and a thick endometrium, a sonohysterogram can determine whether the endometrium is diffusely thick or has focal areas of thickening. With diffuse thickening, a blind endometrial biopsy is appropriate. When there are one or more focal areas of thickening, hysteroscopic biopsy is likely to be the better choice. We present two clinical algorithms, either of which is an acceptable approach to the use of ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy in women with postmenopausal bleeding: the ""ultrasound-first"" approach and the ""biopsy-first"" approach."

In vitro study using human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells showed that Ru-P exhibited a strong two-photon induced fluorescence upon uptake, lysosomal localization and potent two-photon induced cytotoxicity. These results show that Ru-P, which was designed to enhance its cellular uptake, can potentially be used as an efficacious bifunctional two-photon tumor-imaging and photodynamic therapeutic agent despite its moderate two-photon absorption cross-section."
CD011126,0,23342899,0,[Translabial ultrasonography in pelvic floor prolapse and urinary incontinence diagnostics].,"Technological advances in the construction of sonographic devices and increasingly universal access to such tests considerably widens the range of diagnostic application of the sonographic examination. This situation also refers to pelvic organs prolapse. At present, sonographic sets used in everyday obstetrical-gynecological practice allow for insight into the structures forming the female pelvic floor, and the obtained images constitute a valuable addition to the physical examination. Positioning the sonographic transducer on a the perineum enables to visualize the three compartments of the female pelvis minor. After freezing the image, it is possible to assess the position of anatomical structures in relation to bones and designated surfaces, establish mutual distances and measure appropriate angles. Most information can be obtained in this manner within the range of the frontal compartment, whose damage is often linked with urinary incontinence. The examination standards developed so far, including the analysis of the quantitative parameters, greatly minimize the potential subjectivity of the assessment of the existing disorders. Apart from its low costs, the main value of the sonographic examination of the pelvic floor is the possibility to dynamically assess the changes in statics which take place during functional testing. Not only does it have a cognitive significance, but also it allows to adjust the scope of the surgical correction to the existing damages. Thus, indirectly it can contribute to the reduction of a number of subsequent remedial surgeries. Three-dimensional sonography allows to thoroughly examine the construction and functioning of the anal levators and to detect their possible damage. It is the trauma to these muscles--occurring, among others, during childbirth--that is one of the major causes of pelvic organs descent and prolapse in women. Sonographic examination also enables to visualize the artificial material, the use of which is increasingly frequent in the surgical treatment of pelvic organs prolapse. The remedial kits currently in use are not visible in classic X-ray examinations and CT however, they can be easily visualized by means of a sonographic test. This way it is possible to locate the positioned tapes or meshes and to establish their orientation towards the urethra, the bladder and the anus. It is also possible to observe the complications (e.g. hematomas) following the surgical procedures via the transvaginal access. Transperineal sonography is a relatively inexpensive method that may be performed in almost every ultrasonographic laboratory Its value, approaching the MRI diagnostic value in the assessment of the pelvic floor defects and its low cost, place ultrasonography on the first place among the methods of imaging the pelvic and uro-genital diaphragm. The results of diagnostics of pelvic organs prolapse obtained by placing the sonographic head on the patient's perineum may also help in establishing the changes of the support apparatus for the uterus and the vagina, bladder urethra and perineum during functional testing and, thus, to verify the clinically established degree of the prolapse. It seems, also, that this method may be used during peri-urethral injections of specific substances and post-application follow-up, an increasingly frequently employed method of urinary incontinence treatment."
CD011126,0,18035951,0,Confocal endomicroscopy: a novel imaging technique for in vivo histology of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Optical imaging technologies, such as reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy, have shown the potential to provide enhanced detection of changes in the uterine cervix at clinical examination. This review focuses on fluorescence confocal endomicroscopy that enables in vivo microscopic imaging of the cervical epithelium in histological detail in real time. The microscopic imaging technique may permit 'see-and-treat' workflows in colposcopy through high-resolution fluorescence imaging of cellular and subcellular detail from the surface and subepithelial layers of the cervical mucosa. The device may be used in conjunction with a conventional colposcope. Preliminary data from clinical studies suggest that the device can be used to visualize features of the cervical epithelium including the squamo-columnar junction, dermal papillae and endocervical glands. Moreover, the technique has the ability to detect and grade precancerous changes of the cervical epithelium in conditions, such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, where prediction using colposcopy may be problematic. The early detection and diagnosis of gynecological abnormalities through the collection of 'optical' biopsies or targeted mucosal excisional biopsies have the potential to improve patient management through early therapeutic intervention and 'see-and-treat' strategies."
CD011126,0,20956336,0,Single-particle cryoelectron microscopy analysis reveals the HIV-1 spike as a tripod structure.,"The HIV-1 spike is a trimer of the transmembrane gp41 and the peripheral gp120 subunit pair. It is activated for virus-cell membrane fusion by binding sequentially to CD4 and to a chemokine receptor. Here we have studied the structural transition of the trimeric spike during the activation process. We solubilized and isolated unliganded and CD4-bound spikes from virus-like particles and used cryoelectron microscopy to reconstruct their 3D structures. In order to increase the yield and stability of the spike, we used an endodomain deleted and gp120-gp41 disulfide-linked variant. The unliganded spike displayed a hollow cage-like structure where the gp120-gp41 protomeric units formed a roof and bottom, and separated lobes and legs on the sides. The tripod structure was verified by fitting the recent atomic core structure of gp120 with intact N- and C-terminal ends into the spike density map. This defined the lobe as gp120 core, showed that the legs contained the polypeptide termini, and suggested the deleted variable loops V1/V2 and V3 to occupy the roof and gp41 the bottom. CD4 binding shifted the roof density peripherally and condensed the bottom density centrally. Fitting with a V3 containing gp120 core suggested that the V1/V2 loops in the roof were displaced laterally and the V3 lifted up, while the core and leg were kept in place. The loop displacements probably prepared the spike for coreceptor interaction and roof opening so that a new fusion-active gp41 structure, assembled at the center of the cage bottom, could reach the target membrane."

She was admitted to our hospital with rectal bleeding and constipation. We performed several workups. Colonoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography showed sigmoid colon stenosis caused by submucosal tumor, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a sigmoid colon tumor displaying signal hy-pointensity on both T1- and T2-weighted imaging. However, colonoscopic ultrasonography-assisted needle aspiration biopsy could not specify tumor characteristics. From these examinations, the lesion was diagnosed as sigmoid colon endometriosis and laparoscopy-assisted sigmoidectomy was performed. Pathological diagnosis from the resected specimen was identical to preoperative diagnosis, i.e., colonic endometriosis. Since differential diagnosis of intestinal endometriosis seems difficult, a cautious preoperative diagnosis is required to select treatments including minimally invasive surgery."

CD011126,0,19072489,0,3D ultrasound in gynecology and reproductive medicine.,"With advances occurring in medicine on a daily basis, it was only a matter of time before essential gynecological investigations, such as ultrasound, were modified. Many clinicians remain unconvinced by its reputed advantages and 3D ultrasound is not without disadvantages. These mainly relate to the cost implications and training requirements. 3D ultrasound imaging is still at a relatively early stage in terms of its role as a day-to-day imaging modality in gynecology and reproductive medicine. 3D imaging has several obvious benefits that relate to an improved spatial orientation and the demonstration of multiplanar views, of which the coronal plane is particularly useful. It offers a more objective and reproducible measurement of volume and vascularity of the region of interest, and an improved assessment of normal and pathological pelvic organs through further postprocessing modalities, including tomographic ultrasound imaging and various rendering modalities. It also has the benefit of offering reduced scanning time, the option of teleconsultation and storage of images for re-evaluation. However, other than its application in the assessment and differentiation of uterine anomalies, there is very little evidence demonstrating that 3D ultrasound results in a clinically relevant benefit or negates the need for further investigation. Future work should ensure that 3D ultrasound is compared with conventional imaging in randomized trials where the observer is blind to the outcome, only after which will we truly be able to evaluate its role in an evidence-based manner."

CD011126,0,16046399,0,Dodecameric structure of the small heat shock protein Acr1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"Small heat shock proteins are a ubiquitous and diverse family of stress proteins that have in common an alpha-crystallin domain. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has two small heat shock proteins, Acr1 (alpha-crystallin-related protein 1, or Hsp16.3/16-kDa antigen) and Acr2 (HrpA), both of which are highly expressed under different stress conditions. Small heat shock proteins form large oligomeric assemblies and are commonly polydisperse. Nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry showed that Acr2 formed a range of oligomers composed of dimers and tetramers, whereas Acr1 was a dodecamer. Electron microscopy of Acr2 showed a variety of particle sizes. Using three-dimensional analysis of negative stain electron microscope images, we have shown that Acr1 forms a tetrahedral assembly with 12 polypeptide chains. The atomic structure of a related alpha-crystallin domain dimer was docked into the density to build a molecular structure of the dodecameric Acr1 complex. Along with the differential regulation of these two proteins, the differences in their quaternary structures demonstrated here supports their distinct functional roles."

CD011126,0,18176807,0,Measurement of colonic polyps by radiologists and endoscopists: who is most accurate?,"The purpose was to determine the accuracy of polyp measurement by endoscopy and CT. A colonic phantom was constructed containing 12 simulated polyps of known diameter. Polyp diameter was estimated during endoscopy by two observers independently. The phantom was then scanned using a 64-detector-row machine and diameter estimated by a further two observers independently, using 2D and 3D visualisation methods. All measurements were obtained twice. Bland-Altman statistics were used to assess agreement between observers' estimates and the reference diameter. The mean difference between observers' measurements and the reference diameter was smallest for estimates made using 3D CT (-0.09 mm and -0.03 mm) and greatest for endoscopy (-1.10 mm and -1.19 mm), with 2D CT intermediate. However, 95% limits of agreement were largest for 3D CT estimates (-4.38 mm to 4.20 mm). Estimates by 2D CT consistently overestimated polyp diameter, whereas endoscopy consistently underestimated diameter. In contrast, measurements by 3D CT were a combination of over- and under-estimates, with a tendency for disagreement to increase with the size of the polyp. The effect of observer experience was small and repeatability was best for 2D CT. Measurement error was encountered with all three modalities tested. Estimates made by 2D CT were believed to offer the best compromise overall."

CD011126,0,20350640,0,Pelvic floor ultrasound: a review.,"Imaging currently plays a limited role in the investigation of pelvic floor disorders. It is obvious that magnetic resonance imaging has limitations in urogynecology and female urology at present due to cost and access limitations and due to the fact that it is generally a static, not a dynamic, method. However, none of those limitations apply to sonography, a diagnostic method that is very much part of general practice in obstetrics and gynecology. Translabial or transperineal ultrasound is helpful in determining residual urine; detrusor wall thickness; bladder neck mobility; urethral integrity; anterior, central, and posterior compartment prolapse; and levator anatomy and function. It is at least equivalent to other imaging methods in visualizing such diverse conditions as urethral diverticula, rectal intussusception, mesh dislodgment, and avulsion of the puborectalis muscle. Ultrasound is the only imaging method able to visualize modern mesh slings and implants and may predict who actually needs such implants. Delivery-related levator trauma is the most important known etiologic factor for pelvic organ prolapse and not difficult to diagnose on 3-/4-dimensional and even on 2-dimensional pelvic floor ultrasound. It is likely that this will be an important driver behind the universal use of this technology. This review gives an overview of the method and its main current uses in clinical assessment and research."

CD011126,0,17377827,0,Ureteral polyps: an etiological factor of hydronephrosis in children that should not be ignored.,"To better define the demographics, urothelial distribution and typical gross anatomic and radiologic appearances of fibroepithelial polyps of the ureter in children. We reviewed 15 cases of fibroepithelial polyps of the ureter with hydronephrosis from the archives of our department. Data were collected from radiographic studies, gross anatomic pathology and pathology and radiology reports and categorized by age, sex, clinical presentation, lesion size and location. The mean patient age was 9.1 years, and 80% were male. All of them presented with hematuria and/or flank pain. The polyps were located in the upper ureter or ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) and pelvis. Of the polyps, 60% were multiple polyps or filiform, and 40% were single or bilobed and 1-6 cm in size. Only four cases showed typical filling defect on intravenous urography. In five cases, sonography showed a mildly echogenic structure extending into the ureter from the renal pelvis. Enhanced CT revealed soft tissue filling UPJ or/and proximal ureter in six cases, and hydroureter was found in one case by three-dimensional (3D) image. Fibroepithelial polyps were diagnosed in all cases by postoperative histological examination. Fibroepithelial polyps are the most common benign tumors of the ureter. Congenital factor may be associated with the origin of fibroepithelial polyps in children. The preoperative diagnosis of ureteral polyps is difficult. A history of flank pain, hematuria or both, other than abdominal mass, light-to-moderate hydronephrosis with soft-tissue in UPJ or upper ureter, shown by sonography and radiological examination, may help in the diagnosis of ureteral polyps in children. Ureteral polyps should be recognized as an important etiology for hydronephrosis in children."

Because of the variable clinical pictures of obstruction of menstrual flow in adolescence to hypomenorrhea, vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and fertility problems in adult life, early and accurate diagnosis is difficult. Complete uterine and vaginal septum can be easily confused with uterus didelphys. Management of these two müllerian duct anomalies is different. With improved treatment methods for complete relief of symptoms and prevention of further sequelae, comprehensive evaluation is important to identify the underlying problem and formulate appropriate therapeutic plan.

CD011126,0,20880745,0,Endometrial implantation factors in women with submucous uterine fibroids.,"Uterine fibroids are benign tumours, which are associated with subfertility and early pregnancy loss. This study was carried out to examine the effect of submucous fibroids on concentrations of glycodelin, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and osteopontin in uterine flushings. Premenopausal women with a certain diagnosis of submucous fibroid confirmed on three-dimensional saline infusion sonohysterography were recruited into the study. The control group included women without ultrasonic evidence of any uterine or endometrial pathology. All women had uterine flushings performed 7days post LH surge. Enzyme linked immunoassays were performed to analyse glycodelin, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα and osteopontin, whilst immunoradiometric assay was used to analyse IGFBP-1. In 23 women with submucous fibroids, the concentrations of glycodelin and IL-10 in uterine flushings were significantly lower compared with 17 women in the control group (P=0.002; P=0.007, respectively). There were no significant differences between the two groups in concentrations of IGFBP-1, IL-6, TNFα and osteopontin. Women with submucous fibroids had significantly lower concentrations of glycodelin and IL-10 in mid-luteal phase uterine flushings. This finding may explain the association with submucous fibroids and adverse reproductive outcomes. Uterine fibroids are small growths from the muscle of the uterus (womb). Submucous fibroids protrude into the cavity of the womb. We do not know what causes fibroids to form and grow. In most women, fibroids cause no symptoms and they are sometimes detected on routine gynaecological examination. In some women, however, fibroids can cause heavier and longer menstrual periods. Another problem associated with fibroids is bleeding between periods. The effect of fibroids on fertility is not clear, but some doctors believe that they may also cause infertility and early miscarriage. This study tried to see whether presence of submucous fibroids has any effect on various substances produced by the lining of the womb to facilitate development of early pregnancy. Women with a confirmed diagnosis of submucous fibroids were asked to attend the clinic and have the uterine cavity flushed with a special solution 7days after ovulation. The fluid, which was taken back from the womb, was then analysed to measure the amounts of substances that favour pregnancy development. Women with a normal uterine cavity were also asked to have the uterine cavity flushed to act as a comparison. The study showed that the uterine cavities of women with submucous fibroids were producing decreasing amount of substances favourable to early pregnancy development. We speculate that this may explain why some women with submucous fibroids have difficulties falling pregnant. Our findings should be helpful to doctors advising women with submucous fibroids who wish to start a family."

CD011126,0,18055738,0,"Accreditation, certification: why all the confusion?","Tremendous confusion exists concerning the issues of physician certification and practice accreditation in obstetric and gynecologic ultrasonography. Certification speaks to physician competence. All obstetrician-gynecologists who have finished residency training since 1982 are deemed ""competent"" to perform obstetric and gynecologic ultrasonography by virtue of their training. Those trained before 1982 need to be able to describe their level of experience in performing obstetric and gynecologic ultrasonography. Accreditation deals with issues of patient safety and quality control, including equipment calibration, transducer cleaning and disinfection, universal precautions and Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, ultrasound examination protocols, and qualifications of nonphysician personnel performing ultrasound examinations. A new field of radiology benefit managers has arisen in response to attempts by health insurers to manage care, and reduce their costs and utilization. They have adopted ultrasound accreditation, originally intended to enhance patient safety, to help restrict utilization. Currently two organizations are recognized as accrediting bodies: The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), which recognizes obstetric and gynecologic residency training as evidence of competency, and The American College of Radiologists, which does not. Obstetrician-gynecologists should realize that AIUM's accreditation is their ""lifeboat"" in this time of increasing interference by health care insurers into decision making in clinical practice."

A total of 130 young and premenopausal women scheduled for surgery for an adnexal mass with a diameter of 5-10 cm underwent transvaginal ultrasound (US) examination prior to surgery. Laparoscopic management was successfully completed for 118 of the 130 patients in this study; however, 12 required conversion of laparoscopy to laparotomy due to endometriosis with extensive bowel adhesions, or suspected ovarian malignancy and peritoneal implants. One hundred and twenty-four patients (95.38%) had benign lesions, four (3.07%) had borderline tumors and two patients had malignant lesions (1.53%). We found a statistically significant association between laparoscopic and histological findings.

CD011126,0,24339439,0,Adolescent varicocelectomy: does artery sparing influence recurrence rate and/or catch-up growth?,"The prevalence of varicocoeles is 15% in the general adolescent and adult male population and in 35-40% of men evaluated for infertility. While varicocelectomy can be performed using various methods and techniques, the laparoscopic approach allows for clear visualization of the testicular artery and lymphatics. Amongst urologists, particularly paediatric urologists, and andrologists there is much debate regarding the significance of testicular artery sparing when performing a varicocelectomy, with some believing that ligating the testicular artery impairs catch-up growth and future fertility. On the other hand, several studies have reported higher failure rates with artery preservation. To help resolve the debate regarding the significance of artery sparing, we sought to compare varicocoele recurrence rate and catch-up growth in patients who underwent artery sparing laparoscopic varicocelectomy compared with those who had the artery sacrificed. We identified 524 laparoscopic varicocelectomies in 425 patients from our adolescent varicocoele database. Only patients who had ultrasound determined testicular volume measurements pre-operatively and at least 6 months post-operatively were included. Post-operative persistence/recurrence of varicocoele, testicular atrophy and repeat varicocelectomy were noted. Catch-up growth was compared between procedures in those with significant pre-operative asymmetry. Four hundred and forty primary laparoscopic varicocelectomies were performed in 355 patients (mean age: 15.5 years, range 9.3-20.6; mean follow-up: 32.9 months, range 6.0-128.9) who had both pre- and post-varicocelectomy scrotal Duplex Doppler ultrasound performed. The testicular artery was preserved in 54 varicocoeles (41 patients) and ligated in 384 varicocoeles (312 patients). We observed an increased rate of persistent/recurrent varicocoele in the artery-sparing vs. artery ligating patients (12.2% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.09). In addition, there was no difference in catch-up growth and no instance of testicular atrophy. As artery sparing varicocelectomy offered no advantage in regards to catch-up growth and was associated with a higher incidence of recurrent varicocoele, preservation of the artery does not appear to be routinely necessary in adolescent varicocelectomy."
CD011126,0,24337123,0,[Male infertility: recent developments].,"Although male reproductive functions are impaired in about half of the infertile couples seeking offspring, even today the examination and treatment of the male partner continues to be neglected. Despite the lack of evidence for a ""sperm crisis"", so highly touted in the press, the public remains worried, while the fact that male fertility declines beyond the age of 40 years and is accompanied by increasing genetic risks for the offspring goes largely unnoticed. In addition to a thorough physical examination supplemented by imaging techniques such as ultrasonography of the scrotal organs, semen analysis according to WHO guidelines, hormone determinations, and cyto- and molecular genetic analyses form part of the routine investigation of the infertile male. Few disorders have become subjects of rational treatment, such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with gonadotropins or GnRH, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases by antibiotics, and microsurgical reconstruction of blocked seminal ducts. Early treatment of maldescended testes in boys or changing lifestyle (e.g., discontinuation of smoking) are important preventive measures. In the age of evidence-based medicine, most empirical treatments have been demonstrated to be ineffective. Thus, pregnancy rates from patients with varicocele who underwent long-practiced surgical or radiologic interventional therapy were not different from those of patients receiving counseling. At present, in cases of non-obstructive azoospermia or severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using single sperm derived from semen or extracted from testicular biopsy tissue (TESE) represents the most successful treatment modality, although it remains symptomatic and not curative."

This was a retrospective study of the ultrasound scan findings of all women who attended for pelvic ultrasound scan at a new teaching hospital in southern Nigeria from the commencement of ultrasound services on 1 March to 31 July 2010. The main indication for the scans was infertility (52.7%), and the commonest finding was fibroid (44.6%). Polycystic ovary morphology was present in 12.2% of the women. On average women with PCO were younger (30.3 v 35.0 years) and more likely to present with amenorrhea (33.3 v 7.6%) than women without PCO, but there was no other statistically significant differences between the two groups. This study suggests that Nigerian women have a low incidence of PCO morphology."

Edema is classified as immune or non-immune. Today more than 90% of fetal edema has non-immune cause. This paper presents a case of a pregnant woman who was admitted to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department because of fetal hydrops with massive pleural effusion and polyhydramnios at 34 weeks gestation. The intrauterine therapy consisted of two treatments. During the first surgery amnioreduction, evacuation of fluid from the pleural cavity of the fetus, and shunts to both pleural cavities were performed. During the second surgery amnioreduction, cordocentesis with albumin administration and pleural shunt were performed.

Investigations should exclude malignancy and pre-malignancy, and diagnose the benign conditions that need treatment. The three modalities that are most commonly used are transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVS), endometrial biopsy (EB) and hysteroscopy. Most authors agree that the first-line investigation should be TVS, followed by endometrial assessment (EB or hysteroscopy) if the endometrial thickness is >4 mm. When scanning demonstrates the possibility of pathology, outpatient hysteroscopy and biopsy are the gold standard for investigating the endometrial cavity. Focal pathology can be removed during the hysteroscopy, thereby reducing hospital admissions and costs."

This is challenging because the raw CARS signal results from the coherent interference of resonant Raman and nonresonant background and its intensity is not linearly proportional to the concentration of molecules of interest. Here we have developed a sequence of data-processing steps to retrieve background-free and noise-reduced Raman spectra over the whole frequency range including both the fingerprint and C-H regions. Using a classical least-squares approach, we are able to decompose a Raman hyperspectral image of a tertiary polymer blend into quantitative chemical images of individual components.

We reviewed all published series of lymphatic mapping in endometrial cancer available through a PubMed search. Techniques used for identification of sentinel lymph nodes fell into three main categories in relation to the site of injection: 1) uterine subserosal, 2) cervical, and 3) endometrial via hysteroscopy. High detection rates may be achieved in all three categories. The use of both radiolabeled technetium and blue dye has been reported. A combination of cervical and uterine corpus injections appears feasible and less technically demanding than hysteroscopic injections. Immunohistochemistry staining of sentinel nodes coupled with step-serial section may improve the detection of micrometastasis in sentinel nodes. Meaningful sensitivity and false-negative rates cannot be calculated from current series due to their small numbers. The role of lymphatic mapping in endometrial carcinoma and the optimal injection site remains to be determined. A combination of cervical and uterine fundal injections may result in acceptable detection rates.

Three-dimensional ultrasonography is a new technique of diagnosis which has several potential advantages to allow for evaluation of specific anomalies by permitting high-quality views of body surface. We report 4 cases of fetal chromosomal abnormalities including 2 cases of trisomy 21, 1 case of trisomy 13 and 1 case of 48, XXY/+18. All cases were proved to have abnormal chromosomes by amniocentesis or percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling. After 3D reconstruction, we can identify specific facial abnormalities which can not be visualized by conventional two-dimensional ultrasound such as low set ear Mongolian's slant eyes, facial dysmorphism of trisomy 13 and trisomy 18. We also clearly visualized abnormalities of digits such as overlapping fingers, club hands and sandal gap. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the fetal body surface improves the antenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities characterized by a particular dysmorphism. Our report suggests that three-dimensional ultrasonography has the potential to provide novel informations on the fetal anatomy and be useful in visualization and identification of chromosomal abnormalities in utero."
CD011126,0,22733763,0,Cryoelectron tomography reveals doublet-specific structures and unique interactions in the I1 dynein.,"Cilia and flagella are highly conserved motile and sensory organelles in eukaryotes, and defects in ciliary assembly and motility cause many ciliopathies. The two-headed I1 inner arm dynein is a critical regulator of ciliary and flagellar beating. To understand I1 architecture and function better, we analyzed the 3D structure and composition of the I1 dynein in Chlamydomonas axonemes by cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging. Our data revealed several connections from the I1 dynein to neighboring structures that are likely to be important for assembly and/or regulation, including a tether linking one I1 motor domain to the doublet microtubule and doublet-specific differences potentially contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of dynein activity required for ciliary beating. We also imaged three I1 mutants and analyzed their polypeptide composition using 2D gel-based proteomics. Structural and biochemical comparisons revealed the likely location of the regulatory IC138 phosphoprotein and its associated subcomplex. Overall, our studies demonstrate that I1 dynein is connected to multiple structures within the axoneme, and therefore ideally positioned to integrate signals that regulate ciliary motility."

Hyperandrogenism and anovulation are clearly linked to insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinism, with an ovarian androgenic hyperresponsiveness to circulating insulin. Evidence is increasing that suggests that lipotoxicity, which is a key mechanism in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, could also explain the androgen overproduction. During adolescence, diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may be difficult but is of importance because PCOS increases future risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic complications. Metabolic perturbations begin early in adolescence and also exist in adolescent relatives of women with PCOS, even before clinical signs of PCOS. Screening for impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes is also important in this population, and treatment should focus on PCOS clinical manifestations as well as long-term metabolic risk."
CD011126,0,25178606,0,Role of transvaginal sonography (TVS) in the detection of endometrial hyperplasia.,"Transvaginal sonography is superior to transabdominal sonography in most cases of pelvic pathology. A cross sectional study was done with forty patients to evaluate the clinical usefulness of transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) in pre, peri and post menopausal women suspected to have endometrial hyperplasia.. The study was carried out January 2007 to November 2008 for a period of two years. The patients having endometrial hyperplasia diagnosed by TVS were correlated with histopathological diagnosis. Of total 40 cases, 18(45.0%) cases were endometrial hyperplasia and 22(55.0%) were negative for endometrial hyperplasia respectively in TVS findings. Only 2 cases were found as negative for endometrial hyperplasia in histopathology among the all suspected endometrial hyperplasia, which were diagnosed by TVS. On the other hand 17(42.5%) cases were endometrial hyperplasia and 23(57.5%) cases were negative for endometrial hyperplasia in histopathological findings. Among 22 negative for endometrial hyperplasia cases which were diagnosed by TVS, 1 case was endometrial hyperplasia and the rest 21 cases were negative for endometrial hyperplasia in histopathological findings. The validity of TVS in diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia were studied by calculating sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, which were 94%, 92%, 93%, 89% and 96% respectively. As the TVS findings of the present study correlated well with the histopathology findings and the validity test values were higher than observed by others, it can be concluded that TVS is sensitive and accurate modality in the evaluation of endometrial hyperplasia."
CD011126,0,15749093,0,Interactive 3D segmentation using connected orthogonal contours.,"This paper describes a new method for interactive segmentation that is based on cross-sectional design and 3D modelling. The method represents a 3D model by a set of connected contours that are planar and orthogonal. Planar contours overlayed on image data are easily manipulated and linked contours reduce the amount of user interaction.1 This method solves the contour-to-contour correspondence problem and can capture extrema of objects in a more flexible way than manual segmentation of a stack of 2D images. The resulting 3D model is guaranteed to be free of geometric and topological errors. We show that manual segmentation using connected orthogonal contours has great advantages over conventional manual segmentation. Furthermore, the method provides effective feedback and control for creating an initial model for, and control and steering of, (semi-)automatic segmentation methods."

CD011126,0,16772152,0,Mild androgen phenotypes.,"Mild androgen phenotypes are found in 30-40% of patients referred to an endocrine clinic because of suspected hyperandrogenic syndrome. These disorders are characterized by clinical or biological signs of hyperandrogenism in women with normal ovulatory menstrual cycles. Three main mild androgen disorders may be distinguished: ovulatory polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hyperandrogenism, and idiopathic hirsutism. Ovulatory PCOS includes ovulatory hyperandrogenic patients presenting with polycystic ovaries. Using ESHRE/ASRM criteria for diagnosis of PCOS, this disorder is now part of PCOS spectrum. While in vivo and in vitro studies have confirmed the similarities between the two forms of PCOS, ovulatory PCOS presents clinicians with some unique problems. In fact, fertility is not a problem, but insulin resistance is present, and although milder than in classic PCOS it may be associated with an increased cardiovascular and metabolic risk. Because of this, an ovarian sonography should be performed in all ovulatory hyperandrogenic patients, and when polycystic ovaries are found cardiovascular and metabolic risk should be carefully evaluated. Ovulatory PCOS patients with altered glucose tolerance and/or with dyslipidaemia may need treatment with insulin-sensitizing agents. Idiopathic hyperandrogenism regroups ovulatory patients with increased androgen levels and normal ovaries, while idiopathic hirsutism includes ovulatory patients presenting with hirsutism but normal circulating androgens and normal ovaries. The differentiation between these two disorders may be difficult because commercial assays of androgen levels are generally unreliable. While idiopathic hyperandrogenism may be associated with insulin resistance, neither disorder is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. The main clinical problem is hirsutism, and this may be approached by aesthetic or pharmacological therapies."
CD011126,0,16028401,0,[Measurement of endometrial volume and endometrial thickness for assessment of endometrial receptivity in assisted reproductive techniques].,"The authors investigated the role of 3D endometrial volume measurements as a predictor of clinical pregnancy in ART and comparison between endometrial volume and endometrial thickness in order to find the better predictor for endometrial receptivity in ART. Endometrial volume emerged recently as a new efficient predictor of endometrial response to hormonal stimulation and successful implantation. In this clinical study, participated 58 infertile patients undergoing IVF-treatment, during the period from 01.01.2004 till 01.01.2005. Endometrial volume of < 2 ml on the day of Embryotransfer (ET) was a better predictor for low endometrial receptivity, than Endometrial thickness on the same day and resulted in significant lower IVF clinical pregnancy and implantation rates. Endometrial volume > 2 ml on the day of ET was a positive predictor for ART outcome."
CD011126,0,8979096,0,Selection of criteria for the treatment of ovarian cysts on the bases of ultrasound and cytology.,"The major objective of the present study was to determine whether leakage of ovarian cyst cells occurs when the cysts are punctured inside a container with saline. Other subjectives were to determine the sensitivity and specificity of cytology in the differentiation between malignant and benign cysts by comparing cytology data with histology data, and also to determine whether ultrasound can provide consistent evidence for predicting whether the cyst is benign or malignant, thus permitting the selection of patients with benign cysts for puncture rather than surgical exeresis. A cytologic study was carried out on the contents of 62 ovarian cysts diagnosed by ultrasound and clinical examination, and excised from 51 patients submitted to exploratory laparotomy. The cyst was excised and immersed in a container with saline outside the surgical field. The cyst was punctured and its contents aspirated through the wall of the container. Five samples were obtained for cytology: (1) presurgical abdominal wash; (2) saline before cyst puncture; (3) fluid from the punctured cyst; (4) saline after cyst puncture, and (5) postoperative abdominal wash. The materials obtained were submitted to centrifugation and slides of the precipitate were prepared for cytology. A total of 248 slides were studied. Slides of cysts with good cellularity were stained with silver to study the nucleolar organizer regions. Analysis using Kappa statistics showed excellent agreement between the cytologic and histologic diagnoses (p < 0.001). The sensitivity of the cytologic study of the cyst was 75% and the specificity 100%, with a positive predictive value of 100%, a negative predictive value of 92%, and 93% accuracy. The present results led us to conclude that cell leakage into physiological saline occurred after puncture and that cytologic study of cysts valuable in the diagnosis of benign and malignant processes."
CD011126,0,25431767,0,Borderline ovarian tumors and diagnostic dilemma of intraoperative diagnosis: could preoperative He4 assay and ROMA score assessment increase the frozen section accuracy? A multicenter case-control study.,"The aim of our study was to assess the value of a preoperative He4-serum-assay and ROMA-score assessment in improving the accuracy of frozen section histology in the diagnosis of borderline ovarian tumors (BOT). 113 women presenting with a unilateral ovarian mass diagnosed as serous/mucinous BOT at frozen-section-histology (FS) and/or confirmed on final pathology were recruited. Pathologists were informed of the results of preoperative clinical/instrumental assessment of all patients. For Group_A patients, additional information regarding He4, CA125, and ROMA score was available (in Group_B only CA125 was known). The comparison between Group A and Group B in terms of FS accuracy, demonstrated a consensual diagnosis in 62.8% versus 58.6% (P: n.s.), underdiagnosis in 25.6% versus 41.4% (P<0.05), and overdiagnosis in 11.6% versus 0% (P<0.01). Low FS diagnostic accuracy was associated with menopausal status (OR: 2.13), laparoscopic approach (OR: 2.18), mucinous histotype (OR: 2.23), low grading (OR: 1.30), and FIGO stage I (OR: 2.53). Ultrasound detection of papillae (OR: 0.29), septa (OR: 0.39), atypical vascularization (OR: 0.34), serum He4 assay (OR: 0.39), and ROMA score assessment (OR: 0.44) decreased the probability of underdiagnosis. A combined preoperative assessment through serum markers and ultrasonographic features may potentially reduce the risk of underdiagnosis of BOTs on FS while likely increasing the concomitant incidence of false-positive events."
CD011126,0,19262396,0,Torsion of the ovary: a known but frequently missed diagnosis.,"Torsion of the ovary or fallopian tube is a rare acute gynaecological disorder, seen by different medical specialists. The diverse clinical presentation is one of the main reasons this diagnosis is frequently missed at first presentation. For the preservation of ovarian function it is of utmost importance to diagnose an ovarian torsion at an early stage. We will describe the medical history of three patients with a torsion of one of the ovaries to illustrate the variety of clinical presentation. A medical history of pelvic operations or enlarged ovaries often predisposes to torsion of the ovary or fallopian tube. Treatment policy will differ depending on the stage of life. Ovariopexy can be considered to prevent the ovary from torsion and to maintain its function. Torsion of the ovary is an acute gynaecological disorder with an incidence of 3% in a series of acute gynaecological complaints. It is a disorder in which the ovary and the fallopian tube can be affected, combined as well as separated. Although every specialist is familiar with the disorder, the diagnosis in acute presentation is frequently missed. To bring this entity and its great variability in clinical presentation into focus once again, we will highlight three patients out of a series of 13. Furthermore, we will discuss the possible causes of the disorder and present a proposition for treatment."

CD011126,0,23388834,0,Growth of confined cancer spheroids: a combined experimental and mathematical modelling approach.,"A critical step in the dissemination of ovarian cancer is the formation of multicellular spheroids from cells shed from the primary tumour. The objectives of this study were to apply bioengineered three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments for culturing ovarian cancer spheroids in vitro and simultaneously to build on a mathematical model describing the growth of multicellular spheroids in these biomimetic matrices. Cancer cells derived from human epithelial ovarian carcinoma were embedded within biomimetic hydrogels of varying stiffness and grown for up to 4 weeks. Immunohistochemistry, imaging and growth analyses were used to quantify the dependence of cell proliferation and apoptosis on matrix stiffness, long-term culture and treatment with the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel. The mathematical model was formulated as a free boundary problem in which each spheroid was treated as an incompressible porous medium. The functional forms used to describe the rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis were motivated by the experimental work and predictions of the mathematical model compared with the experimental output. This work aimed to establish whether it is possible to simulate solid tumour growth on the basis of data on spheroid size, cell proliferation and cell death within these spheroids. The mathematical model predictions were in agreement with the experimental data set and simulated how the growth of cancer spheroids was influenced by mechanical and biochemical stimuli including matrix stiffness, culture duration and administration of a chemotherapeutic drug. Our computational model provides new perspectives on experimental results and has informed the design of new 3D studies of chemoresistance of multicellular cancer spheroids."

A 32-year-old unmarried female patient presented to our outpatient clinic with complaints of abdominal distention and a palpable abdominal mass extending into the upper abdomen. Ultrasonography and MRI revealed a large solid mass with bilateral cystic areas extending into both uterine adnexa. The patient then underwent a laparotomy. Gross examination revealed normal ovaries and a pedunculated mass with two-sided prominent cystic structures originating from the uterine fundus. The tumor was excised through the peduncle and pathologic evaluation revealed a uterine leiomyoma with cystic degenerations. In conclusion, a large, pedunculated leiomyoma with two-sided cystic degenerations can mimic a bilateral malignant ovarian neoplasm on imaging studies. Therefore, uterine leiomyomas with bilateral cystic degenerations should be considered during the differential diagnosis of malignant ovarian masses."

CD011126,0,25706363,0,ACR appropriateness Criteria® infertility.,"Appropriate imaging for women undergoing infertility workup depends upon the clinician's suspicion for potential causes of infertility. Transvaginal US is the preferred modality to assess the ovaries for features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the leading cause of anovulatory infertility. For women who have a history or clinical suspicion of endometriosis, which affects at least one third of women with infertility, both MRI and pelvic US can provide valuable information. If tubal occlusion is suspected, whether due to endometriosis, previous pelvic inflammatory disease, or other cause, hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is the preferred method of evaluation. To assess for anatomic causes of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) such as Müllerian anomalies, synechiae, and leiomyomas, saline infusion sonohysterography, MRI and 3-D US are most appropriate. Up to 10% of women suffering recurrent pregnancy loss have a congenital Müllerian anomaly. When assessment of the pituitary gland is indicated, MRI is the imaging exam of choice.The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment."

CD011126,0,21302245,0,Laparoscopic treatment of intestinal intussusception in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: case report and review of literature.,"A 47-year-old woman presented with an abdominal mass and nausea. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) showed a sausage-shaped mass with invagination. One polyp that appeared to exceed 3 cm was found in the sigmoid colon. Laparoscopy confirmed an intussusception mass, and the intussusception was dissected by hand-assisted laparoscopy (HALS). The sigmoid colon was also mobilized to the site of the small incision and resected. Generally, we believe enterectomy including polyps should be avoided as much as possible in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) because poly-surgery may lead to short bowel syndrome. In addition, PJS patients often undergo multiple surgery, and therefore dense intra-abdominal adhesions are seen at subsequent laparotomy, which makes surgery increasingly difficult with repeated operations. Laparoscopic-assisted surgery seems beneficial, as in the present case."

CD011126,0,15124990,0,A treatment planning study comparing HDR and AGIMRT for cervical cancer.,"The customization of brachytherapy dose distributions for gynecologic malignancies is limited by the spatial positioning of the applicators. We tested the hypothesis that applicator-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (AGIMRT) has the potential to deliver highly conformal dose distributions to cervical tumors, representing improvement over distributions obtained with intracavitary brachytherapy. A commercial three-dimensional (3-D) treatment planning system was used to create plans for ten cervical cancer patients treated at our institution. Dose distributions of conventionally designed high dose rate (HDR) plans were compared against those of AGIMRT. Tumor delineation was based on a previously published binary threshold technique, using image intensity on positron emission tomography (PET) scans. AGIMRT treatment schedules were designed using two fraction sizes: 6.5 Gy, to directly reproduce the HDR fractionation, and 1.8 Gy, to simulate traditional external beam fractionation. The average minimum tumor dose was significantly greater for the AGIMRT dose distributions than for the HDR distributions (64.2 Gy vs 33.6 Gy; p = 0.005). The mean percent tumor volume at the prescription dose was higher for the AGIMRT plans (90.0% vs 58.2%; p = 0.005). Using AGIMRT, the mean percent volume at the tolerance limit was decreased for the bladder (6.1% vs 16.6%; p = 0.047) but increased for the rectum (4.1% vs 2.2%; p = 0.646). Our study suggests that there may be conceptual and dosimetric advantages to replacing HDR with AGIMRT for patients with large-volume cervical tumors. This investigation is being expanded using sequential PET images to model tumor regression and compare brachytherapy and AGIMRT throughout the course of therapy."
CD011126,0,22296748,0,Recommendations from Gynaecological (GYN) GEC-ESTRO Working Group (IV): Basic principles and parameters for MR imaging within the frame of image based adaptive cervix cancer brachytherapy.,"The GYN GEC-ESTRO working group issued three parts of recommendations and highlighted the pivotal role of MRI for the successful implementation of 3D image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy (BT). The main advantage of MRI as an imaging modality is its superior soft tissue depiction quality. To exploit the full potential of MRI for the better ability of the radiation oncologist to make the appropriate choice for the BT application technique and to accurately define the target volumes and the organs at risk, certain MR imaging criteria have to be fulfilled. Technical requirements, patient preparation, as well as image acquisition protocols have to be tailored to the needs of 3D image-based BT. The present recommendation is focused on the general principles of MR imaging for 3D image-based BT. Methods and parameters have been developed and progressively validated from clinical experience from different institutions (IGR, Universities of Vienna, Leuven, Aarhus and Ljubljana) and successfully applied during expert meetings, contouring workshops, as well as within clinical and interobserver studies. It is useful to perform pelvic MRI scanning prior to radiotherapy (""Pre-RT-MRI examination"") and at the time of BT (""BT MRI examination"") with one MR imager. Both low and high-field imagers, as well as both open and close magnet configurations conform to the requirements of 3D image-based cervical cancer BT. Multiplanar (transversal, sagittal, coronal and oblique image orientation) T2-weighted images obtained with pelvic surface coils are considered as the golden standard for visualisation of the tumour and the critical organs. The use of complementary MRI sequences (e.g. contrast-enhanced T1-weighted or 3D isotropic MRI sequences) is optional. Patient preparation has to be adapted to the needs of BT intervention and MR imaging. It is recommended to visualise and interpret the MR images on dedicated DICOM-viewer workstations, which should also assist the contouring procedure. Choice of imaging parameters and BT equipment is made after taking into account aspects of interaction between imaging and applicator reconstruction, as well as those between imaging, geometry and dose calculation. In a prospective clinical context, to implement 3D image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy and to take advantage of its full potential, it is essential to successfully meet the MR imaging criteria described in the present recommendations of the GYN GEC-ESTRO working group."

CD011126,0,21231852,0,The dynamics of endometrial growth and the triple layer appearance in three different controlled ovarian hyperstimulation protocols and their influence on IVF outcomes.,"The impact of endometrial growth to the triple layer, endometrial thickness, and echogenicity on IVF outcomes was investigated in the study. A retrospective analysis of 583 ICSI patients was conducted: 385 with a long GnRH agonist protocol, 114 with a short GnRH agonist, and 84 with a GnRH antagonist protocol. The progression of endometrial growth to the appearance of the triple layer, endometrial thickness, and echogenicity was compared between protocols. At least one high quality blastocyst was transferred in a double embryo transfer. The time of the appearance of the endometrial triple layer was statistically significant for the pregnancy rate only in the GnRH antagonist protocol. The endometrial thickness on the day of the appearance of the triple layer had a statistically significant influence on the pregnancy rate in the GnRH antagonist and in the long GnRH agonist protocols. The highest pregnancy rate for the long GnRH agonist and the GnRH antagonist protocols was observed when the endometrium thickness was 12-13 mm (61.6% and 58.8%, respectively). The endometrial echogenicity had a significant influence on the pregnancy rate only in the long GnRH agonist protocol. Endometrial features could be helpful parameters in IVF outcomes in particular controlled ovarian hyperstimulation protocols."
CD011126,0,19964614,0,Linear measurement of polyps in CT colonography using level sets on 3D surfaces.,"CT colonography has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to optical colonoscopy for the screening of polyps which are the precursors to colon cancer. Accurate polyp measurement is crucial as the size of a polyp is considered an indication of its potential for malignancy. We present a novel method for the automatic measurement of polyps. It is based on a level set algorithm capable of evolving on the surface of a 3D object represented by a triangular mesh. It is guided by curvature features and is capable of segmenting the polyp neck, that is, the ridgeline/crestline formed around the polyp by its merging to the colon wall. Our method was validated on 40 polyp surfaces obtained from real clinical data. A 3D manual measurement was used as the reference standard. A correlation of 0.825 was found between polyp measurements from our new method and the reference standard."

CD011126,0,23441010,0,Thyroid fine-needle aspiration cytology: is there a place to virtual cytology?,"Telecytology has been used for education, training, and consultation. Cytological studies from gynecological, nongynecological and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) specimens (including studies of thyroid FNAC) analyzed the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of telecytology-based predominantly on static digital images. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic reproducibility of virtual cytology by measuring intraobserver and interobserver agreements among two cytopathologists, using the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) nomenclature. 502 glass slides from 222 cases of thyroid FNAC were retrieved and scanned by a high-resolution scanner generating whole slides images (virtual cytology). Conventional and virtual cytology were analyzed by a skilled cytopathologist and the intraobserver agreement rate was 77.5% with the corresponding κ value of 0.54, suggesting a moderate agreement between both methods. A second cytopathologist analyzed the same slides only by virtual cytology and the interobserver agreement rate was 80.2% with the corresponding κ value of 0.57, suggesting a moderate agreement between both cytopathologists. The virtual cytology resulted in a higher proportion of aspirates classified as nondiagnostic (20.3 and 14.9% for the first and second cytopathologist, respectively) as compared to conventional cytology (8.1%). Regarding specific diagnostic categories as defined by the BSRTC nomenclature, the follicular lesion of undetermined significance category presented the lowest concordance rates, corresponding to 5.9% intraobserver agreement and no (0.0%) interobserver agreement. We suggest that virtual cytology can be an alternative to conventional cytology in assessment of thyroid FNAC specimens, but nondiagnostic aspirates obtained by virtual cytology should be reassessed by conventional cytology."

CD011126,0,25318893,0,Detection of congenital uterine malformation by using transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasound.,"This study assessed the clinical application of transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasound (3D TVUS) in the diagnosis of congenital uterine malformation. A retrospective study was performed on 62 patients with congenital uterine malformation confirmed hysteroscopically and/or laparoscopically. The patients were subjected to transvaginal two-dimensional ultrasound (2D TVUS) and 3D TVUS. The accuracy rate was compared between the two methods. The accuracy rate of 3D TVUS was (98.38%, 61/62), higher than that of 2D TVUS (80.65%, 50/62). 3D TVUS coronal plane imaging could demonstrate the internal shape of the endometrial cavity and the external contour of the uterine fundus. It allowed accurate measurement on the coronary plane, and could three-dimensionally show the image of cervical tube, thereby providing information for the diagnosis of some complex uterine malformation. 3D TVUS imaging can obtain comprehensive information of the uterus malformation, and it is superior to 2D TVUS for the diagnosis of congenital uterine malformations, especially complex uterine anomaly."

Seventy Chinese women with previous GDM were recruited as the study group. The control group comprised women matched for age, parity and delivery year who had a normal oral glucose tolerance test during their index pregnancy. Two- and three-dimensional ultrasound scans were performed to study ovarian morphology and ovarian stromal blood flow. Anthropometric, hormonal and biochemical profiles were compared between women with and without ultrasound features of PCO. The prevalence of PCO in Chinese women was 23%. The group with a history of GDM had a higher but not statistically significant prevalence of PCO (34%). Compared with controls, they had significantly higher incidence of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, fasting insulin and leptin levels, and their lipid profile was less favorable. Also, their level of sex hormone-binding globulin was significantly lower and hence their free androgen index was higher, and so was their level of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. There was a trend for the study group to have higher ovarian stromal blood flow."

Rheological measurements demonstrated that the incorporation of HA increased the compression modulus of the scaffolds. An initial in vitro evaluation showed that scaffolds seeded with porcine chondrocytes formed cartilaginous-like tissue after 8 weeks, and HA functioned to promote the growth of chondrocytes into scaffolds. Placenta-derived multipotent cells (PDMC) and gingival fibroblasts (GF) were seeded on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), CII-HA films, and small intestinal submucosa (SIS) sheets for comparing their chondrogenesis differentiation potentials with those of adipose-derived adult stem cells (ADAS) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC). Among different cells, PDMC showed the greatest chondrogenic differentiation potential on both CII-HA films and SIS sheets upon TGF-β3 induction, followed by GF. This was evidenced by the up-regulation of chondrogenic genes (Sox9, aggrecan, and collagen type II), which was not observed for cells grown on TCPS. This finding suggested the essential role of substrate materials in the chondrogenic differentiation of PDMC and GF. Neocartilage formation was more obvious in both PDMC and GF cells plated on CII-HA composite scaffolds vs. 8-layer SIS at 28 days in vitro. Finally, implantation of PDMC/CII-HA constructs into NOD-SCID mice confirmed the formation of tissue-engineered cartilage in vivo."

CD011126,0,21157982,0,Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome prevention strategies: in vitro maturation.,"The only reliable way to eliminate the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is complete avoidance of gonadotropin ovarian stimulation. It could be argued that in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes represents the most effective strategy to prevent OHSS. IVM has been an established treatment option in many centers worldwide for over a decade. The use of IVM and natural cycle in vitro fertilization (IVF) combined with IVM can result in clinical pregnancy rates that compare to those obtained with conventional IVF. The obstetric and perinatal outcomes of IVM pregnancies are similar to those conceived from stimulated IVF or spontaneous conceptions. To date, more than a thousand healthy infants have been born without an increase in fetal abnormalities. Although IVM may not replace standard IVF, it plays an increasingly important role in assisted reproductive technology, especially in the settings of high responders and those patients at risk of OHSS."

CD011126,0,15716756,0,Pelvic ultrasound in the postabortion and postpartum patient.,"Ultrasound is generally the first imaging method employed when complications are suspected in the pelvis during the postpartum or postabortion period. Much of focus in this regard is in patients with abnormal vaginal bleeding, where one generally wants to know if there are retained products of conception. While ultrasound plays a major role in assessing these problems, there is a lack of consensus on the best sonographic features to use. We will review the ultrasound features that may be useful to identify retained products of conception and will also focus on the overlap of normal and abnormal findings in such patients. Further, we will discuss other issues in the postpartum patient, such as complications unique to the post cesarean-section patient, unusual causes of vaginal bleeding, uterine rupture, uterine arteriovenous malformations, and ovarian vein thrombosis."

CD011126,0,25338686,0,Chemistry and biology of the initial steps in vision: the Friedenwald lecture.,"Visual transduction is the process in the eye whereby absorption of light in the retina is translated into electrical signals that ultimately reach the brain. The first challenge presented by visual transduction is to understand its molecular basis. We know that maintenance of vision is a continuous process requiring the activation and subsequent restoration of a vitamin A-derived chromophore through a series of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Diverse biochemical approaches that identified key proteins and reactions were essential to achieve a mechanistic understanding of these visual processes. The three-dimensional arrangements of these enzymes' polypeptide chains provide invaluable insights into their mechanisms of action. A wealth of information has already been obtained by solving high-resolution crystal structures of both rhodopsin and the retinoid isomerase from pigment RPE (RPE65). Rhodopsin, which is activated by photoisomerization of its 11-cis-retinylidene chromophore, is a prototypical member of a large family of membrane-bound proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). RPE65 is a retinoid isomerase critical for regeneration of the chromophore. Electron microscopy (EM) and atomic force microscopy have provided insights into how certain proteins are assembled to form much larger structures such as rod photoreceptor cell outer segment membranes. A second challenge of visual transduction is to use this knowledge to devise therapeutic approaches that can prevent or reverse conditions leading to blindness. Imaging modalities like optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) applied to appropriate animal models as well as human retinal imaging have been employed to characterize blinding diseases, monitor their progression, and evaluate the success of therapeutic agents. Lately two-photon (2-PO) imaging, together with biochemical assays, are revealing functional aspects of vision at a new molecular level. These multidisciplinary approaches combined with suitable animal models and inbred mutant species can be especially helpful in translating provocative cell and tissue culture findings into therapeutic options for further development in animals and eventually in humans. A host of different approaches and techniques is required for substantial progress in understanding fundamental properties of the visual system."

CD011126,0,20622191,0,Pictorial review of colonic polyp and mass distortion and recognition with the CT virtual dissection technique.,"Virtual dissection is a three-dimensional (3D) display technique for CT colonography that could potentially reduce interpretation times. With virtual dissection, the 3D model of the colon is ""sliced"" open along a centerline trace, rendering a 360° view of the endoluminal mucosa as a rectangular image. However, one must be familiar with several pitfalls and limitations to avoid errors in interpretation. One of the main limitations is the anatomic distortion that results. Polyp shape and colonic folds can be distorted and colonic or polyp mobility can lead to mischaracterization of polyps. Distorted folds, which frequently occur at flexures, can mimic polyps. Annular constricting masses can lead to skip areas, where the abnormality is not displayed. Various entities including diverticula and stool can mimic polyps at virtual dissection. Finally, technical errors such as an inadequate centerline trace can render a polyp occult. The purpose of this review is to demonstrate the spectrum of appearances of polyps at virtual dissection, with an emphasis on more difficult to detect polyps. In addition, 10 interactive virtual dissection quiz cases are presented along with corresponding two-dimensional and 3D endoluminal fly-through views."

CD011126,0,17451078,0,Ovarian volume and uterine length in neonatal girls.,"This study was undertaken to establish reference values for the size of the uterus and ovaries in newborns. We also studied the frequency and follow-up of functional ovarian cysts in healthy neonatal girls. Pelvic ultrasonography was performed on 55 normal newborns. Right and left ovarian volumes positively correlated with birth weight and length, but there was no correlation between uterine length and any of the parameters studied. In a total of 55 newborns, 16 ovarian cysts were detected by transabdominal ultrasound: six neonates (10.9%) had cysts on the left side, ten (18.2%) on the right side, and two (3.6%) had bilateral cysts. All were uncomplicated homogeneous cysts and resolved spontaneously. A higher percentage of cysts was found in the 26 infants weighing 2,500-2,999 g, ten (38.4%) of whom had cysts, than in the 29 infants weighing 3,000 g or more, four (13.7%) of whom had cysts (p < 0.05). Newborns with cysts were followed up, and the cysts resolved spontaneously within 3 months in all but three patients in whom resolution took almost 6 months. Right and left ovarian volumes were positively correlated with birth weight and length, but no significant correlation was found between uterine length and any parameter. In conclusion, ovarian volume was found to be reduced in newborns with relatively low birth weight as well as intra-uterine growth retardation. Functional cysts were more prevalent among low birth weight girls. We suggest that small ovaries and ovarian dysfunction may have a prenatal origin, and further studies on normal and growth-retarded newborns are needed."
CD011126,0,14654152,0,An automatic approach for morphological analysis and malignancy evaluation of ovarian masses using B-scans.,"Ovarian masses are a common phenomenon among women of all ages. The importance of prompt diagnosis of ovarian malignancies is obvious, due to the high mortality rate and the difficulty to detect a tumor in its early stages. In this work, an automatic technique for quantitative analysis and malignancy detection of ovarian masses using B-scan ultrasound (US) images is presented. The core of the technique is morphologic analysis of the ovarian mass. The method employed for this task is divided into two major stages: initial classification of the mass (into one of the three major tumor types: cyst, semisolid, solid), and detailed analysis of the mass. Malignancy evaluation is performed based on the collected data and the criteria provided by commonly used scoring systems. The results reflect adequate performance of the automatic method developed (referring to clinical requirements)."

CD011126,0,17370027,0,Comparison of the main body of the external anal sphincter muscle cross-sectional area between women with and without prolapse.,"The aim of the study was to compare the main body of the external anal sphincter (EAS) cross-sectional area (CSA) of women with and without pelvic organ prolapse. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 40 women were selected for analysis. Of these women, 20 had pelvic organ prolapse and 20 had normal support. Of the women with normal support, 10 had known major levator ani (LA) muscle defects and 10 had normal LA muscles. The same was true for the women with pelvic prolapse: half had major LA defects and half had no LA defects. All patients had previously completed pelvic MRI in the supine position. 3-D models of the EAS were made and CSA of the EAS perpendicular to the fiber direction were measured circumferentially at 30 degrees intervals. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. The mean CSA did not significantly differ between women with prolapse and normal support regardless of LA defect status (normal/-LA defect = 1.13 cm(2), prolapse/-LA defect = 0.86 cm(2), p = 0.065; normal/+LA defect = 1.08 cm(2), prolapse/+LA defect = 1.28 cm(2), p = 0.28). Women with prolapse and LA defects had a 49% larger mean muscle CSA compared to prolapse patients without LA defects (p = 0.01). This difference associated with defect status in prolapse patients was not seen in women with normal support. Women with prolapse alone had external anal sphincter CSAs that were comparable to women with normal support. However, women with both prolapse and a major levator ani defect had larger external anal sphincter CSAs compared to prolapse patients without levator ani defects."

CD011126,0,14502326,0,Tissue harmonic imaging: is it useful in hepatobiliary and pancreatic ultrasonography?,"The introduction of tissue harmonic imaging (THI) could solve problems related to ultrasound in technically difficult patients by providing a marked improvement in image quality. Tissue harmonics are generated by tissue vibration while the transmitted pulse propagates through tissue and are multiples of the fundamental frequency. The harmonic image is obtained by separating the fundamental and harmonic frequencies, the second harmonic, or twice the fundamental frequency, being used for imaging. Through a better spatial resolution, less artifact and an increased visualization of the deep structures, tissue harmonic sonography improves the image quality. In hepatobiliary diseases THI improves the detection and characterisation of focal liver lesions, increases the conspicuity of gallbladder polyps and stones, choledocholithiasis and intrabiliary masses. Visualization of the pancreatic duct, pancreatic calcifications or duct stones is also more accurate with THI. The results with THI are better than those with conventional ultrasonography as the body mass index increases. The limitations of THI can be overcome by the use of the new pulse inversion harmonic imaging."
CD011126,0,24807067,0,Image-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy in inoperable endometrial cancer.,"Inoperable endometrial cancer may be treated with curative aim using radical radiotherapy alone. The radiation techniques are external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone, EBRT plus brachytherapy and brachytherapy alone. Recently, high-dose-rate brachytherapy has been used instead of low-dose-rate brachytherapy. Image-guided brachytherapy enables sufficient coverage of tumour and reduction of dose to the organs at risk, thus increasing the therapeutic ratio of treatment. Local control rates with three-dimensional brachytherapy appear better than with conventional techniques (about 90-100% and 70-90%, respectively)."

CD011126,0,15969806,0,Vibrational spectroscopic and ultrasound analysis for in-process characterization of high-density polyethylene/polypropylene blends during melt extrusion.,"Spectroscopic techniques such as Raman, mid-infrared (MIR), and near-infrared (NIR) have become indispensable analytical tools for rapid chemical quality control and process monitoring. This paper presents the application of in-line Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ultrasound transit time measurements for in-line monitoring of the composition of a series of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/polypropylene (PP) blends during single-screw extrusion. Melt composition was determined by employing univariate analysis of the ultrasound transit time data and partial least squares (PLS) multivariate analysis of the data from both spectroscopic techniques. Each analytical technique was determined to be highly sensitive to changes in melt composition, allowing accurate prediction of blend content to within +/- 1% w/w (1sigma) during monitoring under fixed extrusion conditions. FT-NIR was determined to be the most sensitive of the three techniques to changes in melt composition. A four-factor PLS model of the NIR blend spectra allowed determination of melt content with a standard prediction error of +/- 0.30% w/w (1sigma). However, the NIR transmission probes employed for analysis were invasive into the melt stream, whereas the single probes adopted for Raman and ultrasound analysis were noninvasive, making these two techniques more versatile. All three measurement techniques were robust to the high temperatures and pressures experienced during melt extrusion, demonstrating each system's suitability for process monitoring and control."

CD011126,0,26270760,0,Ultrasound for Infants at Risk for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip.,"The best screening method for developmental dysplasia of the hip is controversial. Ultrasonography is sensitive, but cost-effectiveness may limit its use. This study assessed whether ultrasound screening would increase in effectiveness if targeted toward infants with established risk factors for developmental dysplasia of the hip and normal findings on physical examination. All ultrasound scans performed at the authors' institution from January 2007 through January 2011 to screen for developmental dysplasia of the hip were reviewed. Infants with risk factors for developmental dysplasia of the hip and normal findings on physical examination by orthopedic faculty or a pediatrician were selected. Of the 530 cases that were reviewed, 217 had risk factors for developmental dysplasia of the hip and normal findings on physical examination. Mean age of the 217 selected patients was 6.9 weeks. Of the patients, 83% were female, 77% had breech presentation, 30% were firstborn children, 13% had intrauterine packaging abnormalities, and 3% had a family history of developmental dysplasia of the hip. Of the 217 infants, 44 had 1 risk factor, 121 had 2 risk factors, 46 had 3 risk factors, and 6 had 4 risk factors. Dynamic ultrasound evaluation showed instability in 17 patients, for a 7.8% incidence of developmental dysplasia of the hip. All 17 patients were treated with a Pavlik harness. The results suggested that selective ultrasound screening may be effective in infants with risk factors and normal findings on physical examination. Selective ultrasound screening changed treatment management in almost 8% of patients and clinical follow-up in 6.5%. Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of screening is needed."

There are various causes of postabortion uterine hemorrhage. The objective of this article is to estimate the efficacy of three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) angiography in the diagnosis of this condition. We present 3 case reports of women with massive genital bleeding after abortion. 3D-CT angiography clearly demonstrated the 3-D features of the feeding artery, the draining vein, and the surrounding normal structures. The diagnosis in patient 1 was a uterine arteriovenous malformation, in patient 2 was a placental polyp mimicking a uterine arteriovenous malformation, and in patient 3 was a placental polyp. Patients were all successfully treated with uterine artery embolization or transcervical resection of the placental polyp.

CD011126,0,21966820,0,[Diagnosis of premature menopause measuring circulating anti-Müllerian hormone].,"The production of anti-müllerian hormone for the ovarian follicles begins near the puberty and the circulating levels begin to descend progressively in the stage of the pre-menopause coinciding with the depletion follicular and in consequence the menstrual cycles become irregular, frequently anovulatories. Therefore, concentration of anti-müllerian hormone shows a close correlation with follicular reserve and reproductive capacity, more than FSH and estradiol measurements. We described two patients that developed premature ovarian failure without previous diagnosis and therefore just were treated pharmacologically with estrogen-progestagen to induce menstrual bleeding. In blood of both patients was found low levels (< or = 4 ng/mL) of anti-müllerian hormone, and by means of sonography the absence of follicles was demonstrated in the ovaries. Has intended that premature ovarian failure could be of a chromosomal dysfunction, similar to other gonadal dysgenesias, another explanation of the mechanism is that it could be for development of some autoimmunity dysfunction. Therefore, the combined hormonal substitution of estrogen with progestagen should stay during several years to avoid the complications for the lack of estrogens; in some cases, could be informed on offering the pregnancy possibility by means of the attended fertilization using ovules donor."

These six patients were treated by hysteroscopic polypectomy preceding oocyte retrieval under general anaesthesia after informed consent was obtained. The cause of infertility was male factor in three patients, tubal factor in one, and two cases were unexplained. All patients had undergone ovulation induction and luteal support according to the long luteal protocol. As a result, in three cases pregnancy was achieved (one multiple and two singleton) and three cases were unsuccessful. One of the pregnant women gave birth at term, while the other two pregnancies are still ongoing. There is still no consensus regarding the management of patients diagnosed with endometrial polyp in IVF cycles. Cryopreservation, cycle cancellation and embryo transfer preceding polypectomy is the current management choice. The treatment modalities will be clarified only if embryo transfer preceding polypectomy in the same cycle is proven to be safe. This approach has been used in only six patients so far, and further studies with more patients are needed to confirm these findings."

Group 1 had no urinary symptoms when they underwent the scan, whereas group 2 was comprised of patients with symptoms pertaining to the urinary tract. Between 2000 and 2006, ultrasound examination of the urinary tract was performed in 87 spinal cord injury patients who had no urinary symptoms when they underwent the ultrasound scan. No abnormality was found in 63 patients. The ultrasound scan showed some abnormality of the urinary tract in 24 patients (simple cyst in the kidney: 4; reduced size of a kidney: 3; increased echogenicity of left kidney: 1; prominent extrarenal pelvis and mild calyceal dilatation: 1; slightly dilated renal pelvis and calyceal system: 1; pelvic kidney showing mild hydronephrosis: 1; foetal lobulation of kidney: 2; multicystic kidney with no interval change in the appearance since last examination: 1; 2-cm-diameter parapelvic cyst: 1; small renal calyceal calculus: 5; a little cortical scarring bilaterally: 1; focal renal scar: 2; generalised thinning of renal cortex: 3; increase in renal sinus fat: 3; trabeculated bladder: 2; small vesical diverticulum: 1; mild generalised bladder wall thickening: 1; small residual urine in postvoid scan; 2). No specific interventions were performed in these patients on the basis of ultrasound findings. In Group 2, ultrasound examination revealed serious abnormalities such as hydronephrosis, pyonephrosis, vesical calculi, vesical polyp in 20 of 21 patients, and all 20 patients required therapeutic intervention on the basis of ultrasound scan findings. In conclusion, routine ultrasound examination of the urinary tract in spinal cord injury patients who have no urinary symptoms may not be justifiable in terms of cost effectiveness; limited hospital resources should be directed to spinal cord injury patients with urinary symptoms so that ultrasound examination and therapeutic interventions based on ultrasound findings are carried out expeditiously."

We hoped thereby to determine if sonographic findings could obviate the need for frozen section in certain circumstances. The frozen section and sonographic diagnosis were compared with the final paraffin section diagnosis to determine whether the lesion was felt to be a benign or malignant tumour. Frozen section diagnosis agreed with final paraffin section diagnosis in 137 (77.4%) cases of primary malignant tumours, 201 (90.1%) cases of metastatic disease and 328 (82%) benign cases. Sonographic results matched final pathology of 133 cases of primary malignancy (75.1%) and 192 cases of metastatic disease (86.1%) and 304 benign cases (76%).

A total of 202 women with singleton pregnancies who presented with vaginal bleeding in which fetal heart activity was ultrasonographically demonstrated between 5 and 14 weeks' gestation were included. Pregnancies with fetal abnormalities were excluded from the study. All cases were followed-up with respect to pregnancy outcomes. A total of 54 of 202 pregnancies (26.7%) resulted in fetal loss before 20 weeks' gestation. The mean fetal heart rate (FHR) and cervical length values were lower in spontaneous abortions than in viable pregnancies (121.2 +/- 13.3 vs 143.5 +/- 12.4 and 41 +/- 6.0 vs. 34.8 +/- 6.1, respectively; p < 0.001).

Although no level I evidence exists to strongly support a robotic approach to thyroid surgery, initial non-randomized reports of robotic surgical approaches, in a variety of surgical specialty areas such as cardiothoracic, urologic, gynecologic and head and neck surgery suggest possible advantages of robot assisted techniques. These include platform and instrument stability, tremor reduction, articulating end effectors, three-dimensional, magnified imaging, and improved surgeon ergonomics. Potential negatives associated with robotic surgery include its expense, the lack of haptic feedback, instrument limitations, and the implicit learning curve. Robotic thyroidectomy introduces new potential risks, not typically associated with thyroid surgery. These risks are related to a new approach to the surrounding anatomy and are also associated with the learning curve. The introduction of new technology to any surgery mandates a rational framework for initial assessment and safe implementation. A New Technology Task Force was convened to draft guiding principles which may serve as a framework for the safe implementation of emerging technologies in thyroid surgery. This document suggests initial minimum steps that surgeons should consider during initial implementation of robotic thyroidectomy."

CD011126,0,18936028,0,Diagnostic clues to ectopic pregnancy.,"Ectopic pregnancy accounts for approximately 2% of all pregnancies and is the most common cause of pregnancy-related mortality in the first trimester. Initial evaluation consists of hormonal assays and pelvic ultrasonography (US). A history of pelvic pain along with an abnormal beta human chorionic gonadotropin level should trigger an evaluation for an ectopic pregnancy. The fallopian tube is the most common location for an ectopic pregnancy. An adnexal mass that is separate from the ovary and the tubal ring sign are the most common findings of a tubal pregnancy. Other types of ectopic pregnancy include interstitial, cornual, ovarian, cervical, scar, intraabdominal, and heterotopic pregnancy. Interstitial pregnancy occurs when the gestational sac implants in the myometrial segment of the fallopian tube. Cornual pregnancy refers to the implantation of a blastocyst within the cornua of a bicornuate or septate uterus. An ovarian pregnancy occurs when an ovum is fertilized and is retained within the ovary. Cervical pregnancy results from an implantation within the endocervical canal. In a scar pregnancy, implantation takes place within the scar of a prior cesarean section. In an intraabdominal pregnancy, implantation occurs within the intraperitoneal cavity. Heterotopic pregnancy occurs when an intrauterine and an extrauterine pregnancy occur simultaneously. A spectrum of intra- and extrauterine findings may be seen on US images. Although many of the US findings are nonspecific by themselves, when several of them are seen, the specificity of US in depicting an ectopic pregnancy substantially improves."
CD011126,0,18936027,0,US and CT evaluation of acute pelvic pain of gynecologic origin in nonpregnant premenopausal patients.,"The interpretation of imaging findings in the premenopausal patient with acute pelvic pain is influenced by knowledge of the physiologic changes that occur in the pelvis as well as by the patient's clinical history. Although ultrasonography (US) is the modality of choice for initial imaging, gynecologic disease is detected or suspected with increasing frequency at computed tomography (CT) because of the increasing availability and use of this modality. As a result, the recognition of common features of gynecologic entities on both US and CT images is essential for prompt diagnosis and expeditious management. Categorizing lesions according to their anatomic location, physiologic or pathologic origin, and internal characteristics (cystic, solid, or mixed) allows efficient and accurate diagnosis."

CD011126,0,16710862,0,"Endometrial receptivity: clinical assessment in relation to fertility, infertility, and antifertility.","Fertility in humans and other mammalian species depends absolutely on synchronous events that render the developing blastocyst and the receiving uterus competent for implantation. Endometrial receptivity is defined as the period during which the endometrial epithelium acquires functional, but transient, ovarian steroid-dependent status supportive to blastocyst acceptance and implantation. Once inside the uterus, the blastocyst is surrounded by an intact luminal epithelium, which is considered to act as barrier to its attachment, except for this short period of high endometrial receptivity to blastocyst signal(s). Its transport and permeability properties, in conjunction with cellular action of the endometrium and the embryo, have been suggested to influence creation and maintenance of informational and nutritional status of uterine luminal milieu. This period, also termed as the 'window of implantation,' is limited to days 20-24 of menstrual cycle in humans. However, establishment of endometrial receptivity is still a biological mystery that remains unsolved despite marked advances in our understanding of endometrial physiology following extensive research associated with its development and function. This review deals with various structural, biochemical, and molecular events in the endometrium coordinated within the implantation window that constitute essential elements in the repertoire that signifies endometrial receptivity and is aimed to achieve a better understanding of its relationship to fertility, infertility, and for the development of targeted antifertility agents for human use and welfare."

CD011126,0,21847037,0,"High-field magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis: uterus, ovary, and prostate gland.","Today, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a standard imaging modality for various pathologic disorders in the human pelvis. It has given proof of its usefulness in the diagnosis of several benign and malignant disorders, and it is routinely used for the local staging of different tumors even when confined to specific parts of a pelvic organ. Signal-to-noise ratio and motion artifacts of the examined organ and adjacent bowel structures are major factors for image quality. Setting at 3 T with surface coils avoids technical limitations and discomfort of additional endovaginal or endorectal coils. Definition of high field seems fuzzy because of the availability of MRI machines with 3, 7 T, or higher; therefore, the general aspects of MRI of pelvic structures with emphasis on uterus, ovary, and prostate gland and attention to promising newer techniques such as 3 T, dynamic contrast imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging are reviewed in this article."

CD011126,0,19778484,0,Relevance of triple CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene to ovarian reserve.,"Most individuals demonstrate 29-30 CGG triple repeats on the FMR1 gene. This may functionally represent a normal range in regard to ovarian reserve. Higher counts reflect risk towards premature ovarian senescence, but lower counts have not been investigated before and, therefore, were the principal subject of this investigation. Amongst 316 consecutive infertility patients, 94 demonstrated <28 repeats (group A), 163 28-33 repeats (group B, considered normal repeat numbers) and 59 > or =34 repeats (group C). The three groups did not differ in age, FSH or anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations. Neither FSH nor AMH correlated in linear regression with <28 CGG repeats. In logistic regression, AMH of < or =0.8 ng/ml (indicative of diminished ovarian reserve at all ages) was, however, significantly associated with number of repeats (P < 0.001). Every decrease by five CGG repeats in group A increased the likelihood of diminished ovarian reserve by 40%, while every increase by five CGG repeats in group C increased risk by 50% (both P < 0.002). AMH of < or =0.8 ng/ml statistically correlated overall with decreasing triple CGG repeats throughout all ranges (P < 0.001). Approximately 29-30 CGG repeats appear reflective of normal ovarian reserve, with higher and lower counts denoting similar risks towards premature ovarian senescence."

The purpose of this study was to describe the role of emergency department (ED) bedside transvaginal ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of TOA. This was a retrospective review of non-pregnant ED patients presenting with pelvic pain who were diagnosed with TOA using bedside transvaginal US. ED US examinations were performed by emergency medicine residents and ultrasound-credentialed attending physicians within 1 h after clinical assessment. ED US logs were reviewed for the diagnosis of TOA. Medical records were reviewed for risk factors, medical and sexual history, physical examination findings, laboratory results, additional diagnostic testing, hospital course, and a discharge diagnosis of TOA by the admitting gynecology service. A total of 20 patients with TOA were identified over a 3-year period. Ages ranged from 14 to 45 years (mean 27 years). Seven (35%) patients reported a prior history of PID or sexually transmitted disease, and 1 (5%) was febrile. All had lower abdominal tenderness and 9 (45%) had cervical motion or adnexal tenderness. The sonographic abnormalities included 14 (70%) with a complex adnexal mass, 5 (25%) with echogenic fluid in the cul-de-sac, and 3 (15%) patients with pyosalpinx.

A PubMed search was performed between 1985 and 2012 for reviews, comparative studies, and case reports to provide a review of the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, common laboratory and imaging findings, and treatments of adnexal torsion. Common symptoms of torsion include pain, nausea, and vomiting, with associated abdominal or pelvic tenderness, and may differ in premenarchal and pregnant patients. Laboratory and imaging findings including ultrasound with Doppler analysis, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging can assist in making the diagnosis but should not trump clinical judgment; normal Doppler flow can be observed in up to 60% of adnexal torsion cases.

Although the clinical and metabolic features are similar to those found in adult women, it can be difficult to distinguish the young woman with PCOS from a normal adolescent. Irregular menses, anovulatory cycles, and acne are not uncommon in adolescent women. Adolescents with a history of premature pubarche, a family history of PCOS, Caribbean-Hispanic and African-American ancestry, and/or obesity are at risk for PCOS and deserve close surveillance. The laboratory evaluation of the adolescent with suspected PCOS or hyperandrogenism should be individualized based on the history, symptoms, and examination findings. The cornerstone of management of PCOS in adolescence includes either a combination oral contraceptive or progestin. Consideration of insulin-sensitizing agents, antiandrogens, topical treatments for acne, and various treatments for hair removal are dependent on the patient's symptoms and concerns. Healthy eating, regular exercise, and for the overweight adolescent, weight reduction, are encouraged to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus. Numerous studies have shown that weight loss and exercise decrease androgen levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and lead to the resumption of ovulation. Although initial studies suggest that Metformin may be particularly useful for treating the PCOS adolescent with insulin resistance and obesity, additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy and long-term outcome. Management of the adolescent with PCOS is challenging and requires a supportive, multidisciplinary team approach for optimal results."

The etiology is wide-ranging and includes endometriosis, fibroids, adenomyosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometrial hyperplasia, and polyps. Polycystic ovarian syndrome and some congenital uterine anomalies may present with menstrual disturbance and have been included in this review. Transvaginal ultrasound is widely used as first-line investigation. Magnetic resonance imaging is used increasingly with high diagnostic accuracy and confidence. Its multiplanar capacity and superior tissue contrast resolution enable accurate presurgical mapping of fibroids, deep pelvic endometriosis, and adenomyosis. Similarly, accurate differentiation of congenital uterine anomalies depends on multiplanar imaging with either 3-dimensional ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. Recent advances in imaging and radiological intervention, combined with an understanding of the underlying causes of menstrual dysfunction, therefore aid in accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning."
CD011126,0,19639497,0,Adiponectin and resistin concentrations after glucose load in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Our aims were to evaluate the serum adiponectin and resistin levels at fasting and after glucose load and their interaction with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Twenty-two adolescents with PCOS and 16 healthy controls were included in the study. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in all adolescents. Fasting lipids was measured. Insulin, glucose, adiponectin, and resistin levels were measured at 0 and 120 min of OGTT. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI), fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio (FGIR), and the whole -body insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were calculated. Fasting adiponectin was correlated with ISI (r = 0.729, p < 0.0001), FGIR (r = 0.696, p < 0.0001), QUICKI (r = 0.592, p = 0.004) and HDL-C (r = 0.516, p = 0.028), systolic blood pressure (r = -0.732, p < 0.0001), body mass index (r = -0.738, p < 0.0001), waist circumference (r = -0.706, p < 0.0001), and HOMA-IR (r = -0.595, p = 0.003). No correlation was found between resistin and insulin resistance indexes. Obese adolescents with PCOS have increased CVD risk such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance than normo-weight PCOS. Hypoadiponectinaemia could be increase risks levels in obese girls with PCOS."

CD011126,0,16676568,0,Retzius' space haematoma after spontaneous delivery: a case report.,"We report a case of a haematoma of the Retzius space after spontaneous uncomplicated delivery. In the postpartum period, the patient complained of urinary retention and pain in the hypogastric region radiating to her left hip and leg. The ultrasound examination showed the presence of 160 x 100 x 80 mm confluent solid and liquid areas with peripheral vascularization. At exploratory laparotomy a haemorrhagic infiltration was found in Retzius' space and the anterior wall of the bladder, which appeared thickened and swollen below the peritoneum. We tried to drain the haematoma, however, we failed to drain it completely because of the large blood infiltration in the bladder wall. Clinical and ultrasound follow-up examinations showed a progressive reduction of the haematoma which completely disappeared nine months later. The haemodynamic changes occurring during pregnancy and labour, associated with strong mechanical stress, seem to be among the major causative factors of haematoma formation. Moreover, the venous load in the pelvic vascular system is increased during pregnancy; a stress-induced increase in venous blood pressure might play a prominent role, especially in cases of venous ectasia, where the resistance of blood vessel walls is reduced. Intraoperative evidence seemed to suggest a haemorrhage secondary to the rupture of the venous vessels in the Santorini plexus. The rupture was probably caused by the thrust of the fetal head, associated with abnormality or fragility of the blood vessels, or by some pathologic changes occurring in the anatomical structures during pregnancy, which could not be accurately defined because of the severity and degree of the haematoma infiltration found intraoperatively."

CD011126,0,24034539,0,Diagnosis and management of intramural ectopic pregnancy.,"Intramural pregnancy, a gestation completely surrounded by the myometrium located within the uterine wall with separation from the uterine cavity, is an extremely unusual form of pregnancy. Complications resulting from intramural pregnancy include inevitable uterine rupture with resultant hemorrhage and possible hysterectomy if diagnosis is not made early and treatment is not initiated. An asymptomatic patient was initially diagnosed with a missed abortion at approximately 6 weeks of gestation after a routine ultrasound. Suction curettage was performed approximately 1 month after the initial diagnosis. The pathology specimen failed to reveal placental villi. Ultimately, the diagnosis of intramural pregnancy was made via ultrasound and a computed tomography scan. She was treated with a single dose of systemically administered methotrexate. Over a period of 4 months, β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels trended downward; however, the intramural pregnancy failed to resolve completely, and a persistent mass remained. The intramural pregnancy was removed using the da Vinci laparoscopic procedure (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). If the diagnosis of intramural ectopic pregnancy is made sufficiently early, conservative measures can be taken, which can preserve a patient's future fertility."
CD011126,0,23052729,0,Radiological findings of gastric adenomyoma in a neonate presenting with gastric outlet obstruction.,"Gastric adenomyoma is a rare tumour-like lesion composed of glandular components and smooth muscle bundles. We report a case of gastric adenomyoma in a 1-week-old neonate who presented with gastric outlet obstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest child reported with gastric adenomyoma and a unique case demonstrating radiological findings of gastric adenomyoma in a young infant. At US, the lesion was seen as an asymmetrical mass-like wall-thickening of the pylorus. Upper gastrointestinal series showed findings similar to those seen in a case of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. We suggest that gastric adenomyoma should be included in the causes of gastric outlet obstruction in neonates even though it is rare in young children."

Acute ovarian torsion in children is rare, especially at a very young age, and a difficult diagnosis to make. Infarction caused by ovarian torsion will result if the twist is not unwound spontaneously or surgically in a timely fashion. We presented a case of acute ovarian cyst torsion in a 2-year-old girl who originally presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultimately, she was found to have a 2-cm cyst of the right ovary with concomitant torsion. Because acute ovarian torsion in a very young child is not encountered frequently, timely diagnosis is required to prevent mortality and minimize morbidity. It is important to keep ovarian torsion in the differential of any female children with acute abdominal pain. Emergency physicians should be aware that the potential of acute ovarian torsion in a very young child has a high index of suspicion and seek early operative intervention."

CD011126,0,19304454,0,An automatic method for colon segmentation in CT colonography.,"An automatic method for the segmentation of the colonic wall is proposed for abdominal computed tomography (CT) of the cleansed and air-inflated colon. This multistage approach uses an adaptive 3D region-growing algorithm, with a self-adjusting growing condition depending on local variations of the intensity at the air-tissue boundary. The method was evaluated using retrospectively collected CT scans based on visual segmentation of the colon by expert radiologists. This evaluation showed that the procedure identifies 97% of the colon segments, representing 99.8% of the colon surface, and accurately replicates the anatomical profile of the colonic wall. The parameter settings and performance of the method are relatively independent of the scanner and acquisition conditions. The method is intended for application to the computer-aided detection of polyps in CT colonography."

CD011126,0,9565150,0,Power Doppler findings of adenoma malignum of uterine cervix.,"Adenoma malignum (minimum deviation adenocarcinoma) is a rare neoplasma of the uterine cervix, the diagnosis of wich cannot be determined by cervical smear. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reported as useful for its diagnosis, but differentiation of adenoma malignum from deep-seated nabothian cysts remains problematic. We report here a case of adenoma malignum of the uterine cervix, for which MRI findings could not neglect deep-seated nabothian cysts. However, transvaginal power Doppler ultrasonography clearly showed richness of small vessels, whose arterial flow had higher velocity in the diastolic phase, around the cystic lesion of the uterine cervix. These findings indicate that, at least in the case reported here, transvaginal power and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography is a useful tool for the diagnosis of adenoma malignum of the uterine cervix."

One manifested with polycythemia, others were incidental; none recurred. The mean patient age was 58 years. Three hemangiomas developed in end-stage renal disease. Tumors were well-demarcated, mahogany brown, spongy lesions measuring 0.1 to 5 cm. Tortuous large vessels fed and drained tightly packed anastomosing sinusoidal capillary channels. Four hemangiomas exhibited lobular architecture, central edema/hyalinization, and intravascular growth. Five cases had thrombosis, hemorrhage, and hemosiderin. One ovarian tumor induced stromal luteinization. Three tumors had foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis (one associated with polycythemia). Six cases demonstrated eosinophilic intracytoplasmic globules. Three cases included hobnail endothelial cells. Atypia was minimal and mitoses were absent in all cases. We find this vascular neoplasm unique for the genitourinary system. Despite selected features mimicking angiosarcoma, our data support its benign nature.

CD011126,0,16455515,0,[What is new in brachytherapy?].,"The brachytherapy was used as of the discovery of the radioactivity and became a modern method of conformational irradiation using high technology. Every year, 8-10,000 treatments are delivered, which represents 5% of the total number of irradiations in France. Its revival comes from its increasing use in the treatment of localised cancers of the prostate of favourable prognosis, because of its effectiveness comparable with that of the surgery or the external radiotherapy, its very good immediate tolerance and its better preservation of the erectile function. In 2005, more of 1000 patients were treated in France, number that should quickly rise. The gynecological brachytherapy remains essential in the treatment of the invasive cancers of the uterine cervix. It profits of the progress of the imagery and in the optimisation of the calculation of the dose distribution allowing the optimisation of the irradiation by means of stepping source afterloaders (pulsed brachytherapy). The brachytherapy in head and neck keeps its indications, especially in the exclusive or postoperative irradiation of the cancers of the oral cavity or of the oropharynx. In the treatment of the breast cancer, a new position for the modern brachytherapy should be occur with the concepts of brachytherapy boost. Lastly, many precise indications are always of topicality. Thus, the brachytherapy by permanent implants, at low dose rate, high dose rate or pulsed dose rate, associated to the tools of imagery, of optimisation and technologies of stepping source afterloaders is competing or complementary with new 3D or 4D techniques of three or four dimensional irradiation."

CD011126,0,21917077,0,Ultrasound for evaluation of adnexal malignancy: from 2D to 3D ultrasound.,"Conventional two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound has been widely used for the evaluation of adnexal malignancy in gynecologic fields. This 2D ultrasound evaluation includes a morphological assessment, color/power and pulsed Doppler sonographic assessment, scoring system, and contrast agent assessment of adnexal masses. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound would facilitate the novel assessment of adnexal masses. With the recent advance in 3D power Doppler (3DPD) ultrasound as well as quantitative 3DPD histogram analysis, quantitative and qualitative assessments of the vascularization and blood flow of adnexal masses have become feasible. These novel techniques may assist in the evaluation of adnexal malignancy, and offer potential advantages relative to conventional 2D sonographic assessments. 3D ultrasound may be an important modality in future gynecologic oncology research and in the evaluation of adnexal malignancy in clinical practice, although some limitations regarding the assessment of adnexal malignancy employing 3D ultrasound remain unresolved."

However, the deformation of soft tissue during the course of treatment, such as in cervical cancer, presents significant challenges for the delineation of the target volume and other structures of interest. Furthermore, the presence and regression of pathologies such as tumors may violate registration constraints and cause registration errors. In this paper, automatic segmentation, nonrigid registration and tumor detection in cervical magnetic resonance (MR) data are addressed simultaneously using a unified Bayesian framework. The proposed novel method can generate a tumor probability map while progressively identifying the boundary of an organ of interest based on the achieved nonrigid transformation. The method is able to handle the challenges of significant tumor regression and its effect on surrounding tissues. The new method was compared to various currently existing algorithms on a set of 36 MR data from six patients, each patient has six T2-weighted MR cervical images. The results show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy comparable to manual segmentation and it significantly outperforms the existing registration algorithms. In addition, the tumor detection result generated by the proposed method has a high agreement with manual delineation by a qualified clinician."

CD011126,0,22105016,0,Interactive visibility retargeting in VR using conformal visualization.,"In Virtual Reality, immersive systems such as the CAVE provide an important tool for the collaborative exploration of large 3D data. Unlike head-mounted displays, these systems are often only partially immersive due to space, access, or cost constraints. The resulting loss of visual information becomes a major obstacle for critical tasks that need to utilize the users' entire field of vision. We have developed a conformal visualization technique that establishes a conformal mapping between the full 360° field of view and the display geometry of a given visualization system. The mapping is provably angle-preserving and has the desirable property of preserving shapes locally, which is important for identifying shape-based features in the visual data. We apply the conformal visualization to both forward and backward rendering pipelines in a variety of retargeting scenarios, including CAVEs and angled arrangements of flat panel displays. In contrast to image-based retargeting approaches, our technique constructs accurate stereoscopic images that are free of resampling artifacts. Our user study shows that on the visual polyp detection task in Immersive Virtual Colonoscopy, conformal visualization leads to improved sensitivity at comparable examination times against the traditional rendering approach. We also develop a novel user interface based on the interactive recreation of the conformal mapping and the real-time regeneration of the view direction correspondence."

The authors summarize herein the clinical, radiological, and pathological features of the 41 previously reported cases. The patients typically presented with menorrhagia or symptoms that were ultimately relatable to the presence of a pelvic mass. The median patient age was 46 years (range 23-73). The average tumor size was 15.4 cm (range 4-41); most were exophytic, multinodular, occasionally cystic masses with a congested, spleen or placenta-like color, protruding over the uterine serosa and, variably, the broad ligaments and adjacent organs. In most cases, the exophytic component was contiguous with the intramural dissecting leiomyomatous components. Histological features suggestive of malignancy, such as cytological atypia, necrosis, or increased mitotic activity were absent. Intravascular growth, as assessed histologically, was present in 20% of reported cases, and this finding is apparently devoid of clinical significance based on limited data. Reported information on radiological features is limited. However, these lesions are typically isointense to myometrium on T1-weighted MRI and are in general less heterogeneous on T2 and postcontrast-imaging than sarcomatous lesions. The tumor may display extension to but not frank invasion of surrounding organs. Ultrasound features are nonspecific. Follow-up information was available in 25 (61%) of 41 reported patients: none experienced a tumor recurrence or metastases during the follow-up period, which ranged from 1 month to 41 years. This affirms the benign nature of this tumor, its alarming gross appearance and growth patterns notwithstanding."

Eighty-four patients treated with a combination of external radiotherapy and high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy between January 2000 and December 2004 were retrospectively analyzed. Brachytherapy was prescribed with standard 2D planning. Patients underwent pelvic CT at brachytherapy. The external rectal wall was contoured on the CT images, and the minimum doses delivered to 0.1cc, 1cc, and 2cc of the most irradiated rectal volumes were calculated with dose-volume histograms. The International Commission of Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) rectal point dose was also calculated by conventional method. Total dose (external radiotherapy plus brachytherapy) to the rectum was transformed to the biologically equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions with alpha/beta of 3 Gy (D(0.1cc), D(1cc), D(2cc) and D(ICRU)). The relationships between these dosimetric parameters and the incidence of LRC were analyzed. The 5-year overall actuarial rate of LRC was 26.4%. The values of D(0.1cc), D(1cc), and D(2cc) were significantly higher in patients with LRC than in those without (p < 0.001), but the difference in the values of D(ICRU) was not statistically significant (p = 0.10). The rate of LRC increased significantly with increasing D(0.1cc), D(1cc), and D(2cc) (p = 0.001). However, no positive dose-response relationship was observed between D(ICRU) and the rate of LRC (p = 0.42). The present study has suggested that CT-based 3D dose-volume parameters of the rectum may be effective for predicting LRC."

There is little doubt that some women with adenomyosis may experience troublesome, heavy menstrual bleeding, troublesome dysmenorrhoea, and sometimes a tender uterus. However, the frequency and severity with which these symptoms occur, and the proportion of adenomyosis sufferers who are completely asymptomatic, are quite unclear. The common association of adenomyosis with other pelvic pathologies is an additional factor which confuses the understanding of related symptoms. It is clear that there is no specific combination of symptoms caused by adenomyosis, although many of these women will undoubtedly suffer from very heavy menstrual periods. Now that moderate to severe degrees of adenomyosis can be diagnosed preoperatively with a fair degree of reliability by good-quality ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there is an urgent need for multicentre collaboration to prospectively define symptomatology in a uniform manner, and then correlate this with specific findings on imaging (and compare with later surgical and pathological findings)."

CD011126,0,17186248,0,Evaluation of the anterior ethmoidal artery by 3D dual volume rotational digital subtraction angiography and native multidetector CT with multiplanar reformations. Initial findings.,"Our purpose is to codify the anterior ethmoidal artery (AEA) course and its relationship with adjacent structures. Twenty patients with cerebrovascular disease underwent selective internal carotid dual volume angiography. Fusion of the vascular and bony images was obtained successively on a second console. MDCT of the cranium was performed in all patients. To identify the AEA course, multiplanar CT reformations were obtained. In all cases the entry-point of AEA and its course were identified by means of dual volume angiography. The information was confirmed by MDCT. In a second phase, we studied another 78 patients affected by inflammatory disease and polyposis only by means of MDCT, in order to confirm the previous data obtained by comparison between angiography and MDCT. In this second phase, 110/156 vessels were indirectly detected by means of visualization of the ethmoidal entry point. In the remaining cases, AEA was directly shown due to integrity of the thin ethmoidal bone lamellae or bony canal. Dual volume angiography is essential to identify the course of the AEA (standard of reference for the interpretation of CT). In patients with benign rhinosinusal pathology, where invasivity techniques are not justified, MPR reconstructions were of pivotal importance in the evaluation of the course of the artery with particular reference to its relationship with the frontal recess."

CD011126,0,19163783,0,Automated detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome from ultrasound images.,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder which seriously impacts women's health. The disorder is characterized by the formation of many follicular cysts in the ovary. Nowadays the diagnosis performed by doctors is to manually count the number of follicular cysts, which may lead to problems of the variability, reproducibility and low efficiency. To overcome these problems, an automated scheme is proposed to detect the PCOS. Firstly the input ovary ultrasound image is filtered by an adaptive morphological filter. Then a modified labeled watershed algorithm is used to extract contours of targets. Finally a clustering method is applied to identify expected follicular cysts. The experimental application verifies the effectivity of this proposed scheme, which achieves the accuracy rate of 84%."

CD011126,0,20229450,0,Very high frequency of the polymorphism for the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) at codon 972 (glycine972arginine) in Southern Italian women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"A major component of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the insulin resistance. Only a few studies have evaluated the IRS-1 polymorphism at codon 972, sometimes in the absence of a control group, and with great variability in frequency (0-23% in PCOS vs. 0-17% in controls), and with no unequivocal relationships between the polymorphism and clinical or biochemical indexes. The aim of the work was to evaluate the frequency of the IRS-1 polymorphism at codon 972 in PCOS, and correlate it to clinical and biochemical indexes. We assessed the rs 1801278 polymorphic variant in the IRS-1 gene (Gly972Gly=wild-type; Gly972Arg=heterozygosity; Arg972Arg=homozygosity) in genomic DNA by restriction fragment length polymorphism. The study was conducted at an academic medical center with the participation of 65 women with PCOS and 27 age-matched healthy women (controls). Compared to controls, Gly972Arg was very frequent in PCOS (77% vs. 18%, p<0.0001); one PCOS woman was homozygous. Compared to wild-type PCOS, heterozygous PCOS women had only three significantly different indexes: higher fasting insulin, insulin resistance index, and lower 120 min OGTT glucose. Moreover, in the correlation analysis between any two clinical or biochemical variables, the Pearson's correlation coefficients were frequently of different magnitude in heterozygous PCOS versus wild-type PCOS. Overall, heterozygous PCOS had a greater number of statistically significant relationships between different clinical, metabolic and hormonal indexes: 44 direct and 9 inverse versus 6 and 3, respectively. The IRS-1 Gly972Arg has the highest frequency reported world-wide for PCOS women. This variant is associated with insulin resistance and higher fasting insulin in PCOS women."
CD011126,0,22610138,0,The ultrasound frequency determines the degree of intrinsic coagulation activation.,"Diagnostic ultrasound activates intrinsic coagulation. The aim of the present work was to quantify the action of different ultrasound frequencies on the contact phase of human blood coagulation. Pooled normal citrated platelet-poor plasma in 2 ml aliquots in polypropylene monovettes was exposed to diagnostic ultrasound, changing the ultrasound frequency from 17 to 15 to 12 to 8 to 7 MHz (at an intensity of 1.1 MI). After 0-2 min (23°C), 400 μl samples were withdrawn and placed into polypropylene Eppendorf cups. Forty microliters of plasma sample was pipetted into U-wells polystyrene microtiter plates of high purity (Brand781600). Immediately thereafter, the recalcified coagulation activity assay (RECA) was performed. Seventeen megahertz ultrasound exposure was the weakest activator of intrinsic coagulation of all frequencies tested: even 2 min of exposure at 23°C enhanced F2a generation by only about three-fold. The shorter the ultrasound exposure, the better the action against intrinsic hemostasis: 0.5 min of ultrasound exposure at 23°C induced less than two-fold thrombin generation in all frequencies tested. One minute ultrasound exposure (23°C) triggered intrinsic coagulation strongest at 8 MHz, showing an approximately four-fold increase in F2a generation. A 1.5 min of ultrasound exposure (23°C) triggered coagulation strongest at 7 MHz, showing an approximately 14-fold increase in F2a generation. Two minute of ultrasound exposure (23°C) triggered coagulation strongest at 15 MHz, showing an approximately 18-fold increase in F2a generation. Ultrasound has to be considered as a potential inducer of pathologic systemic coagulation. Patients at risk for increased coagulation activation and/or liver insufficiency should be protected with low molecular weight heparin, if a prolonged ultrasound diagnostic is planned. Ultrasound frequencies of about 17 MHz are the weakest activators of intrinsic coagulation. Ultrasound frequencies of about 7 MHz might be used for therapeutic induction of coagulation activation, such as in patients with severe cerebral or hepatic hemorrhages."

CD011126,0,21683509,0,Sonographic appearances of Morton's neuroma: differences from other interdigital soft tissue masses.,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the ultrasonographic characteristics of Morton's neuroma (MNs) and the usefulness of the ""ginkgo leaf sign"" for differentiating MNs from other interdigital soft tissue masses. The inclusion criteria were 27 patients with the masses in the intertarsal region with surgical proof. Fourteen masses in the 10 patients (mean age, 46) were MNs and nine cases of nine patients were ganglion cysts, seven cases (seven patients) of epidermoid tumors and one case of fibroma were included. Ultrasonographic examinations were performed by a musculoskeletal radiologist using the HDI 5000 (Philips, Bothell, WA, USA) or the Logiq E9 (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) equipped with a linear 6-15 MHz probe, and the findings were interpreted in consensus by two musculoskeletal radiologists. The ultrasonographic findings such as margin, size, echogenicity and deepness of the MNs were compared with those for other interdigital soft tissue masses. The ginkgo leaf sign was defined as the appearance of a biconcave shape of the mass from compression by adjacent structures. The mean size of the MNs was 5.6 mm. There was a significant difference in incidence between males and females (female dominant, p = 0.003). There was no difference in incidence with regard to age (p = 0.259). All lesions were hypoechoic (100%, 14/14) and 10 cases exhibited the ginkgo leaf sign (71%, 10/14, p < 0.001). The lesions were either well marginated (43%, 6/14) or poorly marginated (57%, 8/14, p = 0.075). None of the lesions abutted adjacent bony structures (p < 0.001). Interdigital MNs are primarily found in middle-aged women and often demonstrate the ginkgo leaf sign. MNs are hypoechoic and do not abut adjacent bony structures. Based on our findings, we believe ultrasound of interdigital soft tissue masses may provide useful information with respect to their location to adjacent soft tissue structures. Detection of our Gingko leaf sign may be specific for Morton's neuromas and more studies are needed to confirm its value as a sonographic sign."
CD011126,0,23465265,0,Large uterine neurofibroma.,"Herein we report a rare case of a large uterine neurofibroma. The patient reported infertility and nonspecific pelvic symptoms. Physical examination and ultrasonography revealed a mass of uterine origin with echo texture similar to that of a myoma. With a provisional diagnosis of a myomatous uterus, laparoscopic myomectomy was attempted. The mass, which measured 13 × 9 × 8 cm, was noted to be arising from the uterine fundus and extending into the left broad ligament. Histopathologic examination revealed a neurofibroma, which was confirmed at immunohistochemical analysis of the specimen. Most neurofibromas arise as subcutaneous swellings, and large neurofibromas arising from the myometrium are rare. Deep-tissue neurofibromas are known to recur and are associated with a higher probability of becoming malignant."
CD011126,0,19713285,0,Maternal antenatal complications and the risk of neonatal cerebral white matter damage and later cerebral palsy in children born at an extremely low gestational age.,"In a 2002-2004 prospective cohort study of deliveries of infants at <28 weeks at 14 US centers, the authors sought the antecedents of white matter damage evident in newborn cranial ultrasound scans (ventriculomegaly and an echolucent lesion) and of cerebral palsy diagnoses at age 2 years. Of the 1,455 infants enrolled, those whose mothers received an antenatal steroid tended to have lower risks of ventriculomegaly and an echolucent lesion than their peers (10% vs. 23%, P < 0.001 and 7% vs. 11%, P = 0.06, respectively). Risk of ventriculomegaly was increased for infants delivered because of preterm labor (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 4.9), preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.5, 8.7), and cervical insufficiency (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4, 5.5) when compared with infants delivered because of preeclampsia. Risk of an echolucent lesion was increased for infants delivered because of preterm labor (OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 5.7) and intrauterine growth retardation (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.2, 9.4).

CD011126,0,15621891,0,National survey of current practice in assessing tubal patency in the UK.,"We conducted a postal survey to find out the current practice in the UK regarding the methods employed to assess tubal patency. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate the methods used to assess tubal patency in women presenting with infertility with or without risk factors suggesting pelvic disease. A total of 496 questionnaires were sent and 174 responded (35%). The survey represented an overall view as both gynaecologists and radiologists from secondary and tertiary centres responded. In the responses from radiologists, a hysterosalpingogram was the investigation of choice for both low risk (61%) and high risk women (50%). However in the responses from gynaecologists, in patients with no past gynaecological history, the majority performed a hysterosalpingogram (58%) or hystero contrast sonography (HyCoSy) (14%) whereas in patients in whom pelvic pathology was suspected, most (84%) performed a laparoscopy and dye test. The survey also showed that HyCoSy was performed in only a few centres in the UK. The responses from the majority of gynaecologists were in accordance with the RCOG guidelines. However, still some centres (28%) offered laparoscopy and dye test in low risk women as the primary test for assessing tubal patency. Given the risks associated with laparoscopy, this should be reserved for cases where pathology is suspected and scheduled to be combined with laparoscopic surgery."

In four cases, the diagnosis was made at routine check-ups and these were all treated conservatively. In the fifth case, an erroneous diagnosis of inevitable abortion was made, in a patient presenting with profuse vaginal bleeding. Persistent bleeding following curettage required an emergency hysterectomy, after failure of compressive methods. From the four cases treated conservatively, three received standard methotrexate i.m. (MTX) in combination with bilateral uterine artery embolization (UAE). In one case MTX was followed by intraamniotic puncture and instillation of KCl due to persistent embryonic heartbeat. A spontaneous evacuation of the cervical pregnancy occurred in all patients treated conservatively. We postulate that the preventive use of uterine artery embolization in combination with standard MTX treatment could contribute to reduce the risk of excessive bleeding and facilitate spontaneous expulsion. Possible detrimental effects of the treatment on subsequent reproductive capacities and obstetrical outcome are also pointed out. The diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches are discussed and the literature is reviewed. With referral to the first case of our series, which required an emergency hysterectomy, we want to stress the importance of an early diagnosis for a correct management of this condition."

Treatment of acute PID is very important as it can reduce the risk of sequelae. However, follow-up, partner treatment and counselling are also useful to reduce the reinfection rate. Few weeks after PID, clinical evaluation as well as transvaginal and transabdominal sonography must be performed. The interest of systematic bacteriological tests is not proved. Hysterosalpingography and second-look laparoscopy should be considered only for women with infertility and severe infection. Use of condom is advisable in this population in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STD) including HIV and to decrease rate of recurrence, associated to contraceptive pill, which is also a good option. In selected cases, intrauterine devices can be used in patients with history of PID if the infection is resolved and no significant risk factors for STD exist. Infertility and chronic pelvic pain are the most common sequelae in the population of young women with severe and recurrent infection.

Indeed, occult vaginal bleeding occurs in a majority of neonates, although overt bleeding is estimated to occur in only 5% of neonates. This may be due to functional plugging of the endocervical canal in the neonate, which in turn would promote retrograde flux of endometrial cells contained in menstrual debris. Ectopic endometrial implantation in a newborn with hydrometrocolpos has been documented. These data, coupled with the observation of a significantly increased risk of endometriosis in adolescents with cervical outflow obstruction and patent Fallopian tubes, indicate that endometriosis, especially in children and young adolescents, may originate from retrograde uterine bleeding soon after birth."

CD011126,0,21035282,0,Diagnostic performance of transvaginal gray-scale ultrasound for specific diagnosis of benign ovarian cysts in relation to menopausal status.,In this study we aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound for assigning a specific diagnosis to benign adnexal masses in pre- and postmenopausal women. The study comprised 2146 adnexal masses in 1980 women. 1420 women were premenopausal and 560 were postmenopausal. Specific diagnosis of presumed histology of the lesion using gray-scale ultrasound findings was provided based on examiner's impression. Definitive diagnosis was obtained in all cases. Sensitivity and specificity for each diagnosis were calculated in both pre and postmenopausal women. Specificity for malignant tumors was significantly higher in premenopausal women (p<0.001). Sensitivity for endometrioma (p<0.05) and hemorrhagic cyst (p<0.01) was significantly higher in premenopausal women. There was a trend for a higher sensitivity for serous cyst in postmenopausal women (p=0.09). We conclude that the diagnostic performance of transvaginal gray-scale ultrasound for specific diagnosis of adnexal masses based on examiner's impression is different in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Although a lot of women with uterine fibroids bring the pregnancy without adverse events, data provided in the literature suggest that uterine fibromyomas are associated with several complications. The most important clinic question concerns the impact of myoma on pregnancy and, in some cases, the possibility of a surgical treatment that guarantees a good security for the pregnancy course and the conservation of reproductive capacity. Electronic search of Pubmed between 1993 and 2011, using specific keywords. Management of leiomyomas in pregnancy is conservative and limited, when it is necessary, to medical therapy. The main conditions that induce inevitably the surgical procedure are the torsion of pedunculated fibroid or rare cases of necrosis and resultant inflammatory peritoneal reaction. Laparoscopy technique has several advantages in comparison to previous techniques such as best postoperative course with reduction of pain, fast recovery, less hospitalization and, absence of large and unaesthetic scars. The importance of maternal and fetal welfare thus requires a careful evaluation of several factors that, varying from case to case, lead the authors to choose the most appropriate management."

CD011126,0,23842973,0,From the radiologic pathology archives: esophageal neoplasms: radiologic-pathologic correlation.,"Esophageal neoplasms have a wide spectrum of clinical features, pathologic findings, and imaging manifestations. Leiomyomas are the most common benign esophageal neoplasm, typically appearing as smoothly marginated intramural masses. Fibrovascular polyps arise in the cervical esophagus, gradually elongating as they are pulled inferiorly by esophageal peristalsis. Granular cell tumors are generally incidental small intramural masses with an appearance similar to that of leiomyomas. Malignant esophageal neoplasms are a common cause of cancer mortality, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma. Both of these tumors occur in older men, most often appearing as irregular infiltrative lesions at barium examination, with evidence of tumor spread beyond the esophagus at cross-sectional imaging. Adenocarcinoma arises from Barrett esophagus and is much more likely than SCC to involve the gastroesophageal junction. Esophageal involvement by lymphoma is usually secondary to tumor spread from the stomach or mediastinum. Spindle cell carcinoma is a biphasic malignancy with carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements that forms a bulky polypoid intraluminal mass. Neuroendocrine carcinoma is an aggressive neoplasm that may be hypervascular and is usually associated with metastatic disease at presentation. Understanding the imaging appearances and pathologic bases of esophageal neoplasms is essential for their detection, differential diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning."

CD011126,0,23842975,0,Cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract: embryologic and anatomic considerations and differential diagnosis.,"Cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract are uncommon and usually benign. These cysts have different anatomic origins and may be associated with a variety of genitourinary abnormalities and symptoms. Various complications may be associated with these cysts, such as urinary tract infection, pain, postvoiding incontinence, recurrent epididymitis, prostatitis, and hematospermia, and they may cause infertility. Understanding the embryologic development and normal anatomy of the lower male genitourinary tract can be helpful in evaluating these cysts and in tailoring an approach for developing a differential diagnosis. There are two main groups of cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract: intraprostatic cysts and extraprostatic cysts. Intraprostatic cysts can be further classified into median cysts (prostatic utricle cysts, müllerian duct cysts), paramedian cysts (ejaculatory duct cysts), and lateral cysts (prostatic retention cysts, cystic degeneration of benign prostatic hypertrophy, cysts associated with tumors, prostatic abscess). Extraprostatic cysts include cysts of the seminal vesicle, vas deferens, and Cowper duct. A variety of pathologic conditions can mimic these types of cysts, including ureterocele, defect resulting from transurethral resection of the prostate gland, bladder diverticulum, and hydroureter and ectopic insertion of ureter. Accurate diagnosis depends mainly on the anatomic location of the cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasonography (US) are excellent for detecting and characterizing the nature and exact anatomic origin of these cysts. In addition, transrectal US can play an important therapeutic role in the management of cyst drainage and aspiration, as in cases of prostatic abscess."

Using live cell imaging and fluorescence microscopy we demonstrate that LAP2alpha was mostly cytoplasmic in metaphase and associated with telomeres in anaphase. Telomeric LAP2alpha clusters grew in size, formed 'core' structures on chromatin adjacent to the spindle in telophase, and translocated to the nucleoplasm in G1 phase. A subfraction of lamin C and emerin followed LAP2alpha to the core region early on, whereas LAP2beta, lamin B receptor and lamin B initially bound to more peripheral regions of chromatin, before they spread to core structures with different kinetics. Furthermore, the DNA-crosslinking protein barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) bound to LAP2alpha in vitro and in mitotic extracts, and subfractions of BAF relocalized to core structures with LAP2alpha. We propose that LAP2alpha and a subfraction of BAF form defined complexes in chromatin core regions and may be involved in chromatin reorganization during early stages of nuclear assembly."

A sample of multiconfluent FOL was used (one of the five types of FOL according to a radiographic classification) which was diagnosed histopathologically as ossifying fibroma. Approximately 30 pathological images were assembled into a composite image of the slide using Tiling Boutique software version 3 for Windows (Sanyo Electric, Osaka, Japan). The tiling images were transformed into 8-bit scale images and then into binary images using ImageJ software ver.1.37 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). These images were used for 3D reconstruction using ImageJ software. Images were loaded at the same matrix size and were reconstructed into layers of two-dimensional image stacks, adjusted so that contiguous images were aligned based on their centre points, and arranged with long axes horizontal. 3D findings aided the visual understanding of morphological features in the lesion. The 3D reconstruction can be displayed with arbitrary rotation. In this case, the 3D reconstruction, using Real Image software version 4.01 for Windows (KGT, Tokyo, Japan), was created from an arbitrary section. This allowed us to determine the pattern of calcification between groups of connected osteoids and to compare the internal structure of such lesions that are not visible on histopathological findings. Differentiation of features was even more pronounced with a two colour display indicating fibrous connective tissue and osteoid tissue. A 3D reconstruction of a multiconfluent ossifying fibroma was created using binary images transformed from histopathological images. The quality of the images depends above all on the functionality of the image-processing software. Comparison of each pattern of FOL might allow more simple assessment of the morphological features of FOLs."

Investigation of the biomechanical problem is limited by (1) lack of thorough characterization of the three-dimensional anatomical changes associated with cervical deformation and (2) difficulty measuring cervical tissue properties in vivo. The objective of the present study was to explore the feasibility of using three-dimensional ultrasound and fundal pressure to obtain anatomically-accurate numerical models of large-strain cervical deformation during pregnancy and enable noninvasive assessment of cervical-tissue compliance. Healthy subjects (n = 6) and one subject with acute cervical insufficiency in the midtrimester were studied. Extended field-of-view ultrasound images were obtained of the entire uterus and cervix. These images aided construction of anatomically accurate numerical models. Cervical loading was achieved with fundal pressure, which was quantified with a vaginal pressure catheter. In one subject, the anatomical response to fundal pressure was matched by a model-based simulation of the deformation response, thereby deriving the corresponding cervical mechanical properties and showing the feasibility of noninvasive assessment of compliance. The results of this pilot study demonstrate the feasibility of a biomechanical modeling framework for estimating cervical mechanical properties in vivo. An improved understanding of cervical biomechanical function will clarify the pathophysiology of cervical shortening."
CD011126,0,17690932,0,Computer-aided detection for CT colonography: update 2007.,"Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is an emerging technique for polyp detection in the colon. However, lesion detection can be challenging due to insufficient patient preparation, chosen CT technique or reader imperfection. The primary goal of computer-aided detection (CAD) for CTC is locating possible polyps, and presenting the reader with these polyp candidates. Other goals are sensitivity improvement and reduction of reading time and inter-observer variability. The multistep CAD procedure typically consists of segmentation of the colonic wall (e.g. region growing); selection of intermediate polyp candidates (curvature analysis, sphere fitting, normal analysis, slope density function ...); classification of final candidates for detection and listing suspicious polyps (location, size and volume). Remaining task for the radiologist is the validation or rejection of the polyp candidates. State-of-the-art CAD systems should require minimal or even no user interaction for the extraction of the colonic wall, offer a computation time less than 10-20 min and high sensitivity and specificity for different polyp sizes and shapes, with a low number of false positives. These systems have the potential to increase radiologist's performance and to decrease inter-reader variability. Besides CAD key techniques we also discuss new developments in CAD and describe recent applications facilitating CTC."

CD011126,0,14603539,0,Imaging in cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer traditionally has been staged clinically. Advances in imaging could improve the staging of cervical cancer by facilitating the detection of lymph node metastases and micrometastases in distant organs. Such progress could lead to improvements in treatment selection and therefore increase overall survival rates. At the Second International Conference on Clinical Cancer (Houston, TX, April 11-14, 2002), a panel composed of gynecologic oncologists, radiation oncologists, and diagnostic radiologists reviewed relevant technologies. Advances in lymphangiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and lymphatic mapping were reviewed, along with the impact of these advances on the diagnosis, treatment, and survival of patients with cervical cancer. Few cancer centers still use lymphangiography, but the sensitivity of this method ranges from 28% to 83%, with specificity ranging from 47% to 100%. The roles of transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography in evaluating cervical cancer are expected to expand when new contrast agents increase the sensitivity of these techniques to parametrial invasion and lymph node metastases; meanwhile, ultrasonography's most significant contributions may involve the identification of uterine and cervical leiomyomas and the evaluation of urinary tract obstruction. Advances in CT have made it a rival technique to MRI, but limitations prevent CT from providing definitive information on certain parameters. MRI, which is valuable because of its superior soft tissue contrast resolution, multiplanar capabilities, and cost-effectiveness, is used to determine the size of the cervix and to detect certain types of invasion, characteristics of lymph nodes, and the presence of disease in the ureter, lung, and liver. PET with 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose has been found to detect abnormal lymph node regions better than CT does but PET can also be used in conjunction with CT to measure tumor dimensions. PET also has become a method for identifying tumors that are unresponsive to chemoradiation. When used together with immunohistochemical and molecular techniques as well as conventional stains, sentinel lymph node mapping, an important development in the surgical management of solid tumors, is expected to improve gynecologic cancer management. Advances in imaging methods and in contrast agents, along with advances in the combined use of the two, are expected to make imaging technologies more valuable in cervical cancer assessment."

This imaging technology based on 3-D active stereo vision and motion tracking extracts diagnostic information from the kinetics of acetowhitening process measured from the cervix of human subjects in vivo. Acetowhitening kinetics measured from 137 cervical sites of 57 subjects are analyzed and classified using multivariate statistical algorithms. Cross-validation methods are used to evaluate the performance of the diagnostic algorithms. The results show that an algorithm for screening precancer produced 95% sensitivity (SE) and 96% specificity (SP) for discriminating normal and human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected tissues from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions. For a diagnostic algorithm, 91% SE and 90% SP are achieved for discriminating normal tissue, HPV infected tissue, and low-grade CIN lesions from high-grade CIN lesions. The results demonstrate that the quantitative colposcopic imaging system could provide objective screening and diagnostic information for early detection of cervical cancer."

However, the uterus usually moves to an upward position before 14 weeks' gestation. Incarceration and sacculation of a retroverted uterus occur in 1 in 3000 pregnancies and are difficult to diagnose. They have often been missed until shortly before delivery and can lead to serious obstetric emergencies such as labor dystocia, uterine rupture, retained placenta and uncontrollable postpartum hemorrhage. Performing a Cesarean section without correct diagnosis may cause difficulties in identifying the bladder and the cervix, and therefore in opening the lower uterine segment. This leads to bladder injuries, vaginal transsection and trans- or supracervical hysterectomy. Early diagnosis and detailed scanning are crucial for the obstetric management and operative approach.We report a case of an incarcerated uterus in a patient presenting at 24 weeks' gestation with severe bilateral flank and lower abdominal pain.

Between May 1991 and March 1992, extracorporal ovarian cystectomy was performed in 27 patients who presented with persistent ovarian cysts at the department of gynecology of a large teaching hospital that receives primary referrals from public health care patients. Patients were referred with the diagnosis of a persistent ovarian cyst. Diagnosis was confirmed by pelvic bimanual examination, and transvaginal ultrasound. Cases where malignancy was suspected due to the presence of ascites, semi-solid or solid masses, demonstration of papillations within the ovarian cyst on ultrasound, or elevated CA-125 levels (unless endometriosis was suspected) were excluded from the study group. At laparoscopy, after inspection of the abdominal cavity the cyst was aspirated. The ovary was then extracted through a 2- to 3-cm lower-abdominal incision, cystectomy was meticulously performed according to microsurgical principles, and the repaired ovary was then returned into the abdominal cavity. Extracorporal cystectomy was successfully performed in 26 of 27 cases. The mean duration of the operative procedure was 55 min. The postoperative course was uneventful. Mean postoperative hospitalization time was 22.4 h. Over a follow-up period of up to 15 months, ovarian folliculogenesis was confirmed ultrasonographically.

CD011126,0,14556743,0,A structural analysis of the interaction between ncd tail and tubulin protofilaments.,"ncd is a minus-end directed, kinesin-like motor, which binds to microtubules with its motor domain and its cargo domain as well. Typical of retrograde motors, the motor domain of ncd locates to the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain, and hence, the cargo domain constitutes the N-terminal region. To date, several studies have investigated the interaction properties of the motor domain with microtubules, but very few structural data are available about the tail itself or its interaction with microtubules as cargo. Here, we applied cryo-electron microscopy and helical 3D image reconstruction to 15 protofilament microtubules decorated with an ncd tail fragment (N-terminal residues 83-187, named NT6). In our study, the ncd tail shows a behaviour resembling filamentous MAPs such as tau protein, exhibiting a highly flexible structure with no large globular domains. NT6 binds to four different sites on the outer side of microtubules within the proximity of the kinesin motor-binding site. Two of these sites locate within the groove between two neighbouring protofilaments, and appear as strong binding sites, while the other two sites, located at the outer rim, appear to play a secondary role. In addition, the ncd tail fragment induces the formation of large protofilament sheets, suggesting a tail-induced modification of lateral protofilament contacts."

The procedure utilizes an endoscope, inserted through the vagina and cervix to examine the intra-uterine cavity via a monitor. The difficulty of hysteroscopy from the surgeon's perspective is the visual spatial perception of interpreting 3D images on a 2D monitor, and the associated psychomotor skills in overcoming the fulcrum-effect. Despite the widespread use of this procedure, current qualified hysteroscopy surgeons have not been trained the fundamentals through an organized curriculum. The emergence of virtual reality as an educational tool for this procedure, and for other endoscopic procedures, has undoubtedly raised interests.

A total of 101 infertile women with PCOS resistant to clomiphene citrate were randomized either to combined CoQ10 and clomiphene citrate (51 patients, 82 cycles) or to clomiphene citrate alone (50 patients, 71 cycles). The outcome measures were number of follicles, serum oestradiol, serum progesterone, endometrial thickness and ovulation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates. Numbers of follicles >14 mm and ≥18 mm were significantly higher in the CoQ10 group. Endometrial thickness on the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin was significantly greater in the CoQ10 group (8.82 ± 0.27 mm versus 7.03 ± 0.74 mm). Ovulation occurred in 54/82 cycles (65.9%) in the CoQ10 group and 11/71 cycles (15.5%) in the control group. Clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the CoQ10 group (19/51, 37.3%) versus the control group (3/50, 6.0%). Combination of CoQ10 and clomiphene citrate in the treatment of clomiphene-citrate-resistant PCOS patients improves ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates. It is an effective and safe option and can be considered before gonadotrophin therapy or laparoscopic ovarian drilling."

CD011126,0,22096085,0,Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy using a 6F vesiculoscope for ejaculatory duct obstruction: initial experience.,"Ejaculatory duct obstruction (EDO) is a surgically correctable condition that occurs in some infertile men. The standard therapy is transurethral resection of ejaculatory ducts (TURED). However, TURED has been associated with a high risk of complications, including the impairment of semen parameters and retrograde ejaculation. In our clinical practice, vesiculoscopy has demonstrated potential as a minimally invasive alternative technique for the diagnosis and treatment of EDO. Very few studies have examined transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy (TRU-SVS) in recent years, and no study has examined 6F vesiculoscopes. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study of TRU-SVS using a 6F vesiculoscope and its effect on the diagnosis and treatment of EDO. A total of 21 patients who underwent this procedure were included in the study. The mean patient age was 28.8 years (range, 23-36 years). The procedure was completed successfully in all patients within a mean time of 31.5 minutes and a mean hospital stay of 1.17 days. All patients had EDO. Calculi were found in the ejaculatory ducts or in the seminal vesicles of 5 patients. Sperm was detected in 11 patients 1-3 months postsurgery and in another 8 patients 3-12 months postsurgery. No sperm was detected in the remaining 2 patients by 12 months postsurgery. Epididymitis, retrograde ejaculation, urinary incontinence, and rectal injury were not observed. These data indicate that TRU-SVS using a 6F vesiculoscope affords direct access to the seminal vesicle and offers the advantages of fewer complications and more optimal sperm recovery as well as direct, dynamic video imaging."

After polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, and other ovarian disorders that require medical treatment had been ruled out through smear test examinations of the uterine cervix and uterine myoma, ovarian tumor, and endometriosis had been checked for with ultrasonography and serum CA-125, the subjects began to take 6 g/day of black soybean in micropowder form for 6 months (S group). We estimated the ovular improvement of theses patients, observing basal body temperature (BBT) and follicular development with ultrasonography during the menstrual cycle as the indexes for ovulation and compared them with 34 patients with no treatment (C group). In the S group, improved ovulation was seen in 12 patients, four patients became pregnant, and three patients had anovular menstruation within 3 months after starting to take soybean powder. The periods of first ovulation were 66 +/- 12 days. After ovulation started, all subjects had regular menstruations and ovulation, with more than a 7-day high phase in BBT.

CD011126,0,24835289,0,"Contribution of SPECT/CT imaging to radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer, melanoma, and other solid cancers: from ""open and see"" to ""see and open"".","A few years ago SPECT/CT was successfully incorporated into the sentinel node (SN) procedure for breast cancer and melanoma. Important contributions of SPECT/CT in these two malignancies were the anatomical localization of SNs already visualized on planar images, the detection of additional SNs in aberrant basins, and the depiction of SNs in cases with no visualization on planar images. Recently, in a large series of melanoma patients the use of SPECT/CT was associated with the detection of more metastatic SNs and a higher rate of disease-free survival. Following the experiences in breast cancer and melanoma, SPECT/CT has been applied in oral cavity cancer as well as in urological and gynaecological malignancies. In the areas of lymphatic drainage of these malignancies (head and neck, pelvis, and upper abdomen) SPECT/CT appears to be essential to localize SNs, providing surgeons with helpful anatomical landmarks to plan SN biopsies. In gastrointestinal and lung malignancies SPECT/CT has only incidentally been used. With the improvement of the CT component in the second generation of SPECT/CT gamma cameras, nuclear physicians today can identify lymph nodes corresponding with the radioactive SNs. This is possible using a display of SPECT/CT similar to that of conventional tomography. Multiplanar reconstruction enables to correlate radioactive sentinel nodes seen on fused SPECT/CT with lymph nodes seen on CT, and the use of cross-reference lines allows the navigation between axial, coronal and sagittal views. This visual information is helpful for the intraoperative procedure and for post-excision assessment using portable devices. Fused SPECT/CT images may also be three-dimensionally displayed, improving anatomical SN localisation and recognition. This recent imaging improvement is leading to a new paradigm of ""see and open"" in contraposition to the former ""open and see"" in the SN procedure. The new mixed reality protocols which are able to transfer SPECT/CT to the operating room for surgical navigation will reinforce this ""see and open"" concept. However, a comprehensive interpretation of SPECT/CT together with lymphoscintigraphy is necessary to identify radioactive lymph nodes as sentinel nodes and classify them into different categories that are important for the intraoperative procedure."

However, prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to good clinical outcomes and preservation of the ovary and/or fallopian tube. Ultrasound (US) imaging is most frequently used to assess torsion. However, as computed tomography (CT) utilization in the emergency setting has increased, there are times when CT is the initial imaging test. Additionally, the nonspecific clinical presentation may initially be interpreted as gastrointestinal in etiology, where CT is the preferred exam. For these reasons, it is imperative to know the findings of adnexal torsion on CT as well as US. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is helpful in cases where the diagnosis remains unclear and is particularly helpful in the young or pregnant patient with equivocal sonographic findings, as it provides excellent soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation. This article will illustrate the findings of surgically confirmed ovarian and fallopian tube torsion on US, CT, and MRI, including those in the pregnant patient. Ovarian enlargement, adnexal mass, twisting of the vascular pedicle, edematous and heterogeneous appearance of the ovary, peripheral ovarian follicles, free fluid, uterine deviation towards the side of torsion, adnexal fat stranding, tubal dilatation, and decreased adnexal enhancement will be reviewed. Familiarity with the range of imaging findings across multiple modalities is key to improving the likelihood of timely diagnosis and therefore improved clinical outcomes."

CD011126,0,22846524,0,Ovarian cysts in prepubertal girls.,"Visualization of follicles is perfectly physiological during childhood, their diameter generally does not exceed 10 mm. Ovarian cyst in childhood is well defined for a fluid image >20 mm. Generally mild and asymptomatic, ovarian cysts are fluid formations usually discovered incidentally by ultrasound. Some are hormonally active and cause the development of sexual characteristics. The natural history of functional cysts is eventual regression, and persistence is suggestive of organic tumor. The onset of pain is a sign of complication, and an abrupt sharp pain with vomiting is suggestive of ovarian torsion, in which case surgical intervention is urgent. In all cases, the diagnosis is based on pelvic ultrasound. MRI and tumor marker assays are required to determine the nature of an organic cyst before proceeding to surgery. These cysts may appear functional from the fetal period onward and will require management from the first days of life. Certain endocrine disorders such as precocious puberty, hypothyroidism, and aromatase deficiency cause functional cysts in girls. Recurrent bleeding is due to hormonally active cysts and suggests McCune-Albright syndrome. Although the persistence of a cyst suggests a neoplasm, a fluid character indicates benignity. Imagery is a useful aid in the diagnosis of epithelial tumors (cystadenomas) or teratoma (dermoid cyst)."

CD011126,0,22846520,0,Diagnostic methods in pediatric and adolescent gynecology.,"The evolving role of imaging techniques and endoscopic tools used in gynecologic practice has become essential over the last several years. Pelvic organs of the young girl are deeply hidden in the abdomen and the vagina is narrow and atrophic. The presence of an intact hymen provides an additional obstacle to vaginal examination. Therefore, bimanual pelvic (vaginal/rectal) examination has a limited advantage in this population. It could cause unnecessary discomfort and hamper further 'patient-doctor' dialog. Imaging techniques are constantly improving in sensitivity, thus providing more accurate diagnoses. Ultrasonography which is a safe and available modality provides real-time images of multiple planes and therefore is ideal for pelvic evaluation. It should be an integral part of child and young adolescent examination. Additional modalities such as CT and MRI should be reserved for cases which are ultrasonography doubtful and be applied as a subsequent evaluation. Vaginoscopy and laparoscopy, although invasive, are used for final diagnosis and provision of treatment as 'see and treat' procedures. These main modalities used in the diagnosis of gynecologic disorders in the young are described in this chapter."

Current treatment strategies for ovarian cancer focus on novel drug combinations of cytotoxic agents and molecular targeted agents or novel drug delivery strategies that often involve intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) micelles were loaded with paclitaxel (cytotoxic agent), cyclopamine (hedgehog inhibitor), and gossypol (Bcl-2 inhibitor). After physicochemical studies focusing on combination drug solubilization, 3-drug PEG-b-PCL micelles were evaluated in vitro in 2-D and 3-D cell culture and in vivo in xenograft models of ovarian cancer, tracking bioluminescence signals from ES-2 and SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cell lines after IP injection. 3-Drug PEG-b-PCL micelles were not significantly more potent in 2-D cell culture in comparison to paclitaxel; however, they disaggregated ES-2 tumor spheroids, whereas single drugs or 2-drug combinations only slowed growth of ES-2 tumor spheroids or had no noticeable effects. In ES-2 and SKOV3 xenograft models, 3-drug PEG-b-PCL micelles had significantly less tumor burden than paclitaxel based on bioluminescence imaging, 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) PET imaging, and overall survival. (18)F-FLT-PET images clearly showed that 3-drug PEG-b-PCL micelles dramatically reduce tumor volumes over paclitaxel and vehicle controls. In summary, PEG-b-PCL micelles enable the IP combination drug delivery of paclitaxel, cyclopamine and gossypol, resulting in tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival over paclitaxel alone. These results validate a novel treatment strategy for ovarian cancer based on drug combinations of cytotoxic agents and molecular targeted agents, delivered concurrently by a nanoscale drug delivery system, e.g. PEG-b-PCL micelles."
CD011126,0,24210239,0,[Diagnosis of presumed benign ovarian tumors].,"Symptoms of presumed benign ovarian tumors (PBOT) are not specific (LE4). Personal or family history of gynecological cancers can guide the diagnostic strategy. Clinical examination is ineffective for positive, topographic and etiologic diagnosis of PBOT (LE4). Signs of hormonal impregnation may refer to certain types of tumors (LE4). For any patient presenting with a pelvic mass, pelvic ultrasound is in the first-line exam (grade A); it can classify most ovarian tumors. In case of pure liquid unilocular mass smaller than 7 cm, ultrasound is sufficient to characterize the mass (grade A). In case of indeterminate or complex ovarian mass on ultrasound, MRI is useful to characterize the mass (LE2). Beyond 7 cm, the diagnostic performance of ultrasound decreases (LE2). When a non-unilocular liquid ovarian formation is characterized using ultrasound as determinate mass, ultrasound scan is the only exam recommended (grade B). MRI is indicated as a second-line scan for indeterminate masses or greater than 7 cm (grade B). Cyst puncture for diagnostic purposes has no place in the diagnostic strategy of ovarian cysts (grade C). In case of PBOT in pre-pubertal period, dosing biomarkers is useful but should not delay care. In adult women with PBOT, the measurement of CA125 is not recommended for first-line diagnosis (grade C). Current literature data are not sufficient to specify the diagnostic strategy for an ovarian tumor discovered incidentally during laparoscopy. In case of discovery of a high CA125 value, pelvic ultrasound is the first-line examination. The literature data are still limited to define a CA125 threshold value requiring further exploration or special monitoring, in case of normal pelvic ultrasound."

CD011126,0,25605504,0,Multistage principal component analysis based method for abdominal ECG decomposition.,"Reflection of fetal heart electrical activity is present in registered abdominal ECG signals. However this signal component has noticeably less energy than concurrent signals, especially maternal ECG. Therefore traditionally recommended independent component analysis, fails to separate these two ECG signals. Multistage principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed for step-by-step extraction of abdominal ECG signal components. Truncated representation and subsequent subtraction of cardio cycles of maternal ECG are the first steps. The energy of fetal ECG component then becomes comparable or even exceeds energy of other components in the remaining signal. Second stage PCA concentrates energy of the sought signal in one principal component assuring its maximal amplitude regardless to the orientation of the fetus in multilead recordings. Third stage PCA is performed on signal excerpts representing detected fetal heart beats in aim to perform their truncated representation reconstructing their shape for further analysis. The algorithm was tested with PhysioNet Challenge 2013 signals and signals recorded in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. Results of our method in PhysioNet Challenge 2013 on open data set were: average score: 341.503 bpm(2) and 32.81 ms."

The patient visited the authors again one year later, because of continuous bleeding. At that time, they found a polypoid tumor in the uterine cavity, which turned out to be adenosarcoma with sarcomatous overgrowth.

CD011126,0,17523164,0,Standardization of three-dimensional images in obstetrics and gynecology: consensus statement.,"Standardization of the display of ultrasound images has so far only been achieved in transabdominal two-dimensional (2D) sonography. In contrast, there is a lack of uniformity in the demonstration of transvaginal 2D ultrasound images. The described non-uniformity frequently leads to confusion in the assessment of an image, in particular with regard to the accurate anatomical assignment of left/right and dorsal/ventral. Three-dimensional (3D) sonography offers a unique opportunity to avoid this confusion in the interpretation of ultrasound images, because, independent of primary volume acquisition, the volume can always be rotated so that the stored object can at all times be visualized in a known anatomical position, rendering it of no importance whether the image acquired transvaginally is demonstrated from above or from below. This will also be important in allowing fusion of ultrasound image data with computed tomographic, magnetic resonance and/or positron emission tomography images. In this article we suggest that standardization of transabdominal and transvaginal 3D images does not only provide the inexperienced physician/sonographer with a guide to spatial orientation, but also serves to avoid erroneous topographical interpretations."

CD011126,0,25560143,0,Committee opinion no. 618: Ovarian reserve testing.,"The main goal of ovarian reserve testing is to identify those individuals who are at risk of decreased or diminished ovarian reserve, commonly known as DOR. Although ovarian reserve testing cannot predict the end of one's reproductive years, results outside the range expected for a patient's age can encourage the individual to pursue more aggressive treatment options to achieve pregnancy. Ovarian reserve testing should be performed for women older than 35 years who have not conceived after 6 months of attempting pregnancy and women at higher risk of diminished ovarian reserve. When test results suggest decreased or diminished ovarian reserve, if appropriate, an infertility evaluation should be initiated. It is reasonable to counsel the woman that her window of opportunity to conceive may be shorter than anticipated, and attempting to conceive sooner rather than later is encouraged. Compared with women of similar age, women with diminished ovarian reserve commonly have regular menses but a reduced quantity of ovarian follicles and, thus, may have a limited response to ovarian stimulation with fertility medications and reduced fecundity (probability of achieving a live birth in a single reproductive cycle). At this time, ovarian reserve testing results cannot be extrapolated to predict the likelihood of spontaneous conception."

These neoplasms are generally asymptomatic but may have potentially life-threatening sequelae. Lipoma is the most common primary benign paratesticular neoplasm and the most common tumor of the spermatic cord. Adenomatoid tumor is the most common tumor of the epididymis, followed by leiomyoma. In adult patients, it is imperative to consider sarcomas in the differential diagnosis of all solid tumors of the scrotum. The most common sarcomatous tumors in pediatric patients are embryonal sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Metastases, particularly from testicular, prostatic, renal, and gastrointestinal primary malignancies, can also occur. Mimics of paratesticular neoplasms including polyorchidism and splenogonadal fusion are rare but must also be considered for optimal management. Ultrasonography (US) is currently the imaging modality of choice. However, US findings are often variable and nonspecific and do not usually allow definitive characterization.

Most recently, low bone mineral density (BMD) has been repeatedly reported in patients with end-stage heart failure. We assessed the association, if any, of BMD with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in a general older population. We assessed the association of LVEF with T score, Z score, and stiffness index in all 312 subjects aged 75 and over living in Tuscania, Italy. Among women, LVEF was associated with T score (beta = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.05; P = 0.033), Z score (beta = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.04; P = 0.038), and stiffness index (beta = 0.25, 95% CI 0.02-0.48; P = 0.036) in multivariable linear regression analysis, after adjusting for lifestyle habits, demographic variables, comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, and objective measurements. No significant associations were observed in men. In linear discriminant analysis, the LVEF cutoff level that best predicted osteoporosis was < or =49%. Left ventricular function is directly and independently associated with all of the ultrasonographic BMD parameters in older women. As left ventricular dysfunction, often asymptomatic, is a prevalent finding in older women, this association and its potential therapeutic implications should be assessed in dedicated studies."

Proportions of stage IV endometriosis and posterior cul-de-sac obliteration were higher in patients with bilateral recurrence than in those with unilateral recurrence (p < 0.01 for all comparisons) and in patients with contralateral recurrence than in those with ipsilateral recurrence (p < 0.05 for all comparisons), but no differences were found in other characteristics of participants according to the laterality or pattern of recurrence. In conclusion, the lateral distribution of recurrent endometrioma was not associated with that of the primary lesion, and endometrioma did not recur more frequently in the treated ovary. An advanced stage and the presence of posterior cul-de-sac obliteration were factors associated with bilateral or contralateral recurrence of endometrioma."

CD011126,0,23065859,0,Improving strategies for diagnosing ovarian cancer: a summary of the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) studies.,"In order to ensure that ovarian cancer patients access appropriate treatment to improve the outcome of this disease, accurate characterization before any surgery on ovarian pathology is essential. The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) collaboration has standardized the approach to the ultrasound description of adnexal pathology. A prospectively collected large database enabled previously developed prediction models like the risk of malignancy index (RMI) to be tested and novel prediction models to be developed and externally validated in order to determine the optimal approach to characterize adnexal pathology preoperatively. The main IOTA prediction models (logistic regression model 1 (LR1) and logistic regression model 2 (LR2)) have both shown excellent diagnostic performance (area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively) and outperform previous diagnostic algorithms. Their test performance almost matches subjective assessment by experienced examiners, which is accepted to be the best way to classify adnexal masses before surgery. A two-step strategy using the IOTA simple rules supplemented with subjective assessment of ultrasound findings when the rules do not apply, also reached excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 90%, specificity 93%) and misclassified fewer malignancies than did the RMI. An evidence-based approach to the preoperative characterization of ovarian and other adnexal masses should include the use of LR1, LR2 or IOTA simple rules and subjective assessment by an experienced examiner."

The benefit of ultrasound is the characterization of an adnexal mass, suggesting the probable etiology of the mass. Masses may be divided as solid, cystic, or complex. It is predominantly the solid and complex masses that need a thorough evaluation. The role of color-flow imaging is now gaining importance and criteria for distinguishing between benign and malignant masses are often possible. Availability of a scoring system enables the differentiation of small adnexal masses. Several benign lesions may present as complex masses but can be distinguished and diagnosed on sonography. The availability of 3D ultrasound has been of great use to understand spatial relations and vascular morphology. Sonography allows a more detailed assessment of morphologic features of an adnexal mass. With a benign-appearing adnexal mass on sonography, the need for any further diagnostic tests is often obviated."

Therefore, also appendiceal malignancy can be the underlying cause, making accurate preoperative diagnosis imperative, even if this disease is often asymptomatic and an early diagnosis still remains very difficult on imaging studies. In women, appendiceal mucoceles can sometimes present on clinical and instrumental findings as a right adnexal mass mimicking an ovarian neoplasm. A rare case of appendiceal mucocele in a 36-year-old women with a right-sided painful pelvic mass is presented. The mucocele was misdiagnosed as a cystic complex mass of the right adnexa both clinically and ultrasonographically. Serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 were increased. Explorative laparoscopy was performed revealing an enlarged vermiform appendix with the uterus and adnexa macroscopically normal, and no signs of intraperitoneal metastasis or adnexal torsion. Laparotomic appendectomy followed. Histological examination revealed a mucinous cystadenoma of the vermiform appendix.

CD011126,0,24513707,0,Investigating the three-dimensional flow separation induced by a model vocal fold polyp.,"The fluid-structure energy exchange process for normal speech has been studied extensively, but it is not well understood for pathological conditions. Polyps and nodules, which are geometric abnormalities that form on the medial surface of the vocal folds, can disrupt vocal fold dynamics and thus can have devastating consequences on a patient's ability to communicate. Our laboratory has reported particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, within an investigation of a model polyp located on the medial surface of an in vitro driven vocal fold model, which show that such a geometric abnormality considerably disrupts the glottal jet behavior. This flow field adjustment is a likely reason for the severe degradation of the vocal quality in patients with polyps. A more complete understanding of the formation and propagation of vortical structures from a geometric protuberance, such as a vocal fold polyp, and the resulting influence on the aerodynamic loadings that drive the vocal fold dynamics, is necessary for advancing the treatment of this pathological condition. The present investigation concerns the three-dimensional flow separation induced by a wall-mounted prolate hemispheroid with a 2:1 aspect ratio in cross flow, i.e. a model vocal fold polyp, using an oil-film visualization technique. Unsteady, three-dimensional flow separation and its impact of the wall pressure loading are examined using skin friction line visualization and wall pressure measurements."

Cyst puncture can reduce tumor volume and destruct the cyst wall, alleviate sticking circumstances and enhance the chance of recovery. But simple aspiration without other treatments results in high recurrence rate (28.5 % to 100 %). In order to reduce recurrence after aspiration, ultrasound-guided aspiration with instillation of tetracycline, methotrexate, and recombinant interleukin-2 has been combined and proven to be effective with the recurrence rates of 46.9 %, 18.1 %, and 40 % respectively. Noma et al. (2001) reported that conduct of ethanol instillation for more than 10 min particularly for a case with a single endometrial cyst is considered most effective from the standpoint of recurrence (14.9 %). Our goal is to analyze patients with recurrent pelvic cyst who underwent surgical intervention. The research data are based on clinical diagnosis, symptoms and medical intervention classification, and the cyst numbers are defined as forecast project target.

In a prospective study, 168 couples were stimulated with clomiphene citrate from day 3 to day 7 of the cycle and endometrial thickness was assessed by ultrasound three times on the day of ovulation triggering. Ovulation was induced with HCG as soon as >/=1 follicle of >/=17 mm was present at ultrasound independently of endometrial thickness. IUI was performed 36 h after HCG administration. The main outcome measure was ongoing pregnancy. No difference was observed in endometrial thickness between patients who did or did not achieve an ongoing pregnancy (7.6 +/- 0.3 versus 7.6 +/- 0.2 respectively; P = 0.7). No discriminative ability of endometrial thickness on the achievement of ongoing pregnancy could be shown by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (area under the ROC curve 0.51, 95% CI: 0.44-0.59). In conclusion, endometrial thickness cannot predict ongoing pregnancy achievement in IUI cycles stimulated with clomiphene citrate."

Follow-up of the treated fibroids was performed with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and patients' symptoms were assessed by telephone interviews. The procedure was initially technically successful in 3 of the 4 patients and MRI studies at 1 month demonstrated complete fibroid ablation. Symptom improvement, including a decrease in menstrual bleeding and pain, was achieved in 2 patients at 3 months. At 7 months, 1 of these 2 patients experienced symptom worsening which correlated with recurrent fibroid on MRI.

CD011126,0,21450029,0,Two cases of angular pregnancy complicated by preterm labor and placental abruption at mid-pregnancy.,"Angular pregnancy is the rare condition in which the gestational sac is implanted in the lateral angle of the uterine cavity. There have been several reports on angular pregnancies; however, due to a lack of clinical understanding, angular pregnancy does not appear to be recognized as a clinical entity and many cases are likely to go undiagnosed. This report involves two women with angular pregnancies: one had placenta abruption and the other had preterm delivery at mid-trimester and postpartum endometritis. The former was diagnosed early with Three-dimensional sonography, but the other was not diagnosed until the time of cesarean section. This is the first report on the sonographic diagnosis of angular pregnancy. Through these cases, we emphasize the benefit of an accurate early diagnosis of angular pregnancy and careful prenatal care because of the possible risk of adverse perinatal outcome."

Spontaneous uterine rupture in early pregnancy due to placenta percreta is rare. We report a case of this life-threatening complication occurring at the sixteenth week of gestation. The patient presented with signs of shock, acute abdomen, and evidence of hemoperitoneum. The pregnancy was viable with a normal ultrasound appearance that created some confusion and there was a dilemma in the diagnosis of this case. Various obstetric and surgical causes were taken into consideration. The patient was taken to the operating room immediately for exploratory laparotomy. She was found to have fundal uterine rupture, which was managed by uterine repair. This patient had prior cesarean section and dilatation and curettage; factors well known to predispose for placenta percreta. Here, we emphasize the importance of a fast decision and surgical intervention to save a patient's life in cases of uterine rupture."

CD011126,0,20890738,0,Diagnosis and management of pouchitis and ileoanal pouch dysfunction.,"Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) or UC with dysplasia and for the majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. However, UC patients with IPAA are susceptible to inflammatory and noninflammatory sequelae, such as pouchitis, Crohn's disease of the pouch, cuffitis, and irritable pouch syndrome, in addition to common surgery-associated complications, which adversely affect the surgical outcome and compromise health-related quality of life. Pouchitis is the most frequent long-term complication of IPAA in patients with UC, with a cumulative prevalence of up to 50%. Pouchitis may be classified based on the etiology into idiopathic and secondary types, and the management is often different. Pouchoscopy is the most important tool for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis in patients with pouch dysfunction. Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for active pouchitis. Some patients may develop dependency on antibiotics, requiring long-term maintenance therapy. Although management of antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis has been challenging, secondary etiology for pouchitis should be evaluated and modified, if possible."

Despite these pitfalls, there are enough benefits to consider medical abortion with methotrexate and misoprostol as a safe method with a high success rate of more than 91% and a good alternative for surgical abortion. An invasive procedure is not necessary, there are no long-term complications and it can be performed at an earlier stage, which makes it more acceptable in society. In Curaçao, where abortion is legally restricted, medical abortion is performed with methotrexate and misoprostol. In countries where abortion is legal, mifepristone and misoprostol are the first choice."
CD011126,0,19780744,0,"The obstructed hemivagina, ipsilateral renal anomaly, uterus didelphys triad.","The triad of obstructed hemivagina, renal anomaly and uterus didelphys is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain and menstrual discomfort in adolescent girls. Accurate diagnosis and surgical treatment can be delayed for several months or even years. Adolescent girls presenting with these symptoms should have a baseline pelvic ultrasound scan to establish uterine anatomy. In those with ultrasound findings of Müllerian anomalies appropriate follow up would include a magnetic resonance imaging, preferably at a tertiary centre with expertise in interpretation of Müllerian anatomy, as well as early consultation and referral to a centre with experience in the management of these rare conditions. Appropriate surgery would be a single stage procedure to either excise or completely divide the obstructing septum. There is currently no consensus on concurrent laparoscopy.

CD011126,0,1294412,0,Preoperative investigations for suspected pelvic masses.,"Ultrasound examination was performed on 307 patients admitted to Herlev Hospital, Copenhagen, for suspicion of a pelvic tumor. Of these, 194 were operated on, 38 (19.6%) having a malignant tumor and 156 with benign conditions. A solid tumor was suspected in 72 patients on whom intravenous pyelography, barium enema, cystoscopy and rectoscopy were performed, although 11 did not undergo an intravenous pyelography and 12 did not undergo a barium enema. Intravenous pyelography, barium enema, rectoscopy and cystoscopy very seldom gave unsuspected information and never changed the indications for operation. Ultrasound examination of the kidneys, urinary tract, bowel system, liver and retroperitoneum as a complementary investigation to the gynecologic examination of the pelvic tumor gave the same information as did the barium enema, intravenous pyelography, rectoscopy and cystoscopy. Therefore, we conclude that these investigations should be carried out only in patients with symptoms from the urinary tract or the bowel system. Instead, we suggest that ultrasound examination of a pelvic mass also include an examination of the kidneys, urinary tract, bowel system, liver and retroperitoneum."

Furthermore, patients consult general practitioners as well as specialist gynaecologists, urologists, vascular surgeons and phlebologists who are frequently unaware of this condition. Investigation protocol must first eliminate other diseases with similar clinical disorders and then identify which veins are responsible for PCS related to compression or reflux. Selective venography is the more informative investigation but transvaginal ultrasound examination is a valuable screening test. Outcome analyses after endovenous treatment have been reported in several articles, but no randomized controlled trial is available for comparing various operative treatments knowing that most of them were undertaken after failure of medical treatment. In our experience, about two-thirds of patients were symptom-free after vein compression, stenting, or embolization at middle-term assessment."

Radiologic mapping of the DIE lesion sites is crucial for case management, patient counseling, and surgical planning. Transvaginal ultrasonography (US) is the initial imaging modality for investigating DIE and has been the focus of several recent studies. DIE typically manifests at imaging as hypoechogenic nodules throughout the affected sites and thickening of the intestinal wall, with some lesions showing a mixed pattern due to cystic areas. Transvaginal US performed after bowel preparation improves the ability to diagnose intestinal lesions and provides invaluable details, including which layers of the intestine are affected and the distance between the lesion and the anal border. It is vital that radiologists be familiar with the technical aspects of this modality and with the US manifestations of DIE lesions.

The pathologic diagnosis of RPOC is made based on the presence of chorionic villi, which indicates persistent placental or trophoblastic tissue. In the setting of postpartum hemorrhage, however, distinguishing RPOC from bleeding related to normal postpartum lochia or uterine atony can be clinically challenging. Ultrasonographic (US) evaluation can be particularly helpful in these patients, and a thickened endometrial echo complex (EEC) or a discrete mass in the uterine cavity is a helpful gray-scale US finding that suggests RPOC. However, gray-scale US findings alone are inadequate for accurate diagnosis. Detection of vascularity in a thickened EEC or an endometrial mass at color or power Doppler US increases the positive predictive value for the diagnosis of RPOC. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful when US findings are equivocal and typically demonstrates an enhancing intracavitary mass in patients with RPOC. Diagnostic pitfalls are rare but may include highly vascular RPOC, which can be mistaken for a uterine arteriovenous malformation; true arteriovenous malformations of the uterus; invasive moles; blood clot; and subinvolution of the placental implantation site."

CD011126,0,21776915,0,Improving early detection of ovarian cancer.,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women, accounting for more than 6700 new cases diagnosed each year in the U.K. The incidence has increased over the past 20-25 years, particularly in the 65 and over age group. The outcome for women with ovarian cancer is generally poor, with an overall five-year survival rate of less than 35%. Most women are diagnosed with advanced stage disease. Earlier diagnosis could improve survival outcome. Although 93% of women experience symptoms before diagnosis, a GP with an average sized practice may only see one case of ovarian cancer every five years. Evidence has shown that combining a number of symptoms that occur on a persistent or frequent basis (particularly more than 12 times per month) can have a sensitivity of up to 85% and a positive predictive value of the order of 0.2%. NICE recommends that serum CA125 should be the initial test followed by pelvic and abdominal ultrasound if the serum CA125 is abnormal. These tests should be requested by GPs prior to definitive referral. If both tests are abnormal, then these women should be referred on the two-week urgent referral pathway to the local specialist unit. When ultrasound, CA125 and clinical status suggest ovarian cancer, a CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen should be performed to establish the extent of disease."

The number of mature oocytes retrieved correlated strongly with AFC (r = 0.832, p ≤ 0.001) and OV (r = 0.835, p ≤ 0.001), but weakly with VI (r = 0.166, p = 0.016), FI (r = 0.151, p = 0.028), and VFI (r = 0.14, p = 0.041). AFC and OV correlate strongly with the number of mature oocytes retrieved in IVF/ICSI cycles, whereas 3D PD indices of the ovarian stromal vascularity have a weak correlation."

CD011126,0,22305456,0,Ovarian incidentaloma.,"Incidental adnexal masses occur with relatively high frequency in post-menopausal women, with a prevalence rate of 3.3-18% in asymptomatic patients. Unilocular, benign-appearing ovarian cysts represent the vast majority of abnormal findings at transvaginal ultrasonography. As many as 80% will resolve over a period of several months; if persistent, unchanged, less than 10 cm, and with normal CA-125 values, the likelihood of an invasive cancer is sufficiently low that observation should be offered. More recent investigations support the use of secondary imaging modalities such as MRI, which may help differentiate benign from malignant masses. Surgical management plays a key role when patients are symptomatic regardless of age, menopausal and have documented changes in cyst characteristics, experience elevations in tumor markers or have symptoms suggestive of a hormone-producing neoplasm. High level, evidence-based screening guidelines have yet to be developed."
CD011126,0,19527374,0,Third S. S. Ratnam memorial lecture 2007. Ovarian cancer: Is there hope for women?,"Ovarian cancer is today the most lethal female cancer with an overall survival of only 49.9%. The currently available screening modalities are disappointing in detecting highly curable early stage ovarian cancer. Natural history of ovarian cancer is unknown; it appears it can develop quickly from normal looking ovaries. Timely referral of women with non-specific symptoms (such as abdominal bloating, pelvic pain) for an ultrasound scan or blood CA125 assessments may help in the early diagnosis. Patients with Stage IA or IB disease with grade 1 tumors have a cure rate of >90%; this is likely to be compromised by laparoscopic surgery. In selected patients fertility preservation with good obstetric outcome is possible. However, the relapse rate in 'high risk' early stage ovarian cancers is 40-45%; adjuvant chemotherapy is needed. Only 20-25% of those with stage III and IV disease are cured. Despite a high primary response (70%) majority (70-75%) will relapse and all are likely to succumb. Optimal debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy are needed for stages III and IV disease; the outcome is superior if managed by gynecologic oncologists. Where cost of drugs is an important consideration, an alternative is carboplatin (an affordable and equally effective drug). The role of vaccines needs further study. When relapses occur palliation will be the aim in most instances. Oral contraceptives, breast feeding, tubal sterilization and hysterectomy also have a protective effect. Risk-reducing salpingo-oopherectomy has been suggested in women with BRCA mutations."

Inspired by the interpretative methodology of radiologists using 3-D fly-through mode in CTC reading, we have developed an algorithm which utilizes sequences of images (referred to here as videos) for classification of CAD marks. For each CAD mark, we created a video composed of a series of intraluminal, volume-rendered images visualizing the detection from multiple viewpoints. We then framed the video classification question as a multiple-instance learning (MIL) problem. Since a positive (negative) bag may contain negative (positive) instances, which in our case depends on the viewing angles and camera distance to the target, we developed a novel MIL paradigm to accommodate this class of problems. We solved the new MIL problem by maximizing a L2-norm soft margin using semidefinite programming, which can optimize relevant parameters automatically. We tested our method by analyzing a CTC data set obtained from 50 patients from three medical centers. Our proposed method showed significantly better performance compared with several traditional MIL methods."

If midstream urine is difficult to receive, a catheter urine will be easy to obtain. Further investigations as urodynamics, cystoscopy and ultrasound may be required. As initial step, stress incontinence should be treated with physiotherapy and pelvic floor exercises, if not successful with operations as suburethral slings. Slings have good long-term success rates of approximately 85 % with a low morbidity and can even be inserted under local anaesthetic. The treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder consists of bladder training, a behavioural therapy, and mainly anticholinergics.

Three types of soldered stainless steel (SS) wires: PW, LW, and SiS were prepared (n = 3) and subjected to multiple end-point analysis (MEA). Six pieces were cut from each wire. Each piece was placed on the triplicate cell cultures (RHOE model based on TR 146 cells). After 24 hours of topical exposure, the cell cultures were cut and stained with haematoxylin/eosin. Toxicity was assessed by evaluating the morphological changes and classifying these as mild, moderate, or severe. The in vitro cell cultures were subjected to a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in order to quantify viability. Copper wires served as the control to determine severe toxicity and native cell cultures were used as a baseline. Untreated SS wire (0.9 mm) was included for comparison with the welded wires. Histological evaluation with respect to toxicity and measurement of viability in the 3D cell cultures showed no severe toxicity or loss of viability for any of the wires. The morphological ranking of the tested wires from mild to severe toxicity was: SS = PW = LW < SiS. MTT tests revealed the following mean viability values: native cell line (negative control) 98.1 per cent, SS 96.8 per cent, PW 95.5 per cent, LW 95.5 per cent, SiS 85.7 per cent, and copper wires (positive control) 51.2 per cent.

CD011126,0,21461620,0,Crossing borders to bind proteins--a new concept in protein recognition based on the conjugation of small organic molecules or short peptides to polypeptides from a designed set.,"A new concept for protein recognition and binding is highlighted. The conjugation of small organic molecules or short peptides to polypeptides from a designed set provides binder molecules that bind proteins with high affinities, and with selectivities that are equal to those of antibodies. The small organic molecules or peptides need to bind the protein targets but only with modest affinities and selectivities, because conjugation to the polypeptides results in molecules with dramatically improved binder performance. The polypeptides are selected from a set of only sixteen sequences designed to bind, in principle, any protein. The small number of polypeptides used to prepare high-affinity binders contrasts sharply with the huge libraries used in binder technologies based on selection or immunization. Also, unlike antibodies and engineered proteins, the polypeptides have unordered three-dimensional structures and adapt to the proteins to which they bind. Binder molecules for the C-reactive protein, human carbonic anhydrase II, acetylcholine esterase, thymidine kinase 1, phosphorylated proteins, the D-dimer, and a number of antibodies are used as examples to demonstrate that affinities are achieved that are higher than those of the small molecules or peptides by as much as four orders of magnitude. Evaluation by pull-down experiments and ELISA-based tests in human serum show selectivities to be equal to those of antibodies. Small organic molecules and peptides are readily available from pools of endogenous ligands, enzyme substrates, inhibitors or products, from screened small molecule libraries, from phage display, and from mRNA display. The technology is an alternative to established binder concepts for applications in drug development, diagnostics, medical imaging, and protein separation."

CD011126,0,23085900,0,Quantitative analysis of angle-resolved scattering properties of ovarian tissue using optical coherence tomography.,"Angle-resolved optical scattering properties of ovarian tissue, on different optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging planes, were quantitatively measured by fitting the compounded OCT A-lines into a single scattering model. Higher cross correlation value of angle-resolved scattering coefficients between different OCT imaging planes was found in normal ovaries than was present in malignant ovaries. The mean cross correlation coefficient (MCC) was introduced in this pilot study to characterize and differentiate normal, n=6, and malignant, n=4, ovaries. A specificity of 100 percent and a sensitivity of 100 percent were achieved by setting MCC threshold at 0.6. Collagen properties, within the OCT imaging penetration depth, were also qualitatively studied in terms of their content, structure and directivity. The homogeneous three-dimensional collagen fiber network, observed in the normal ovary, effectively explains the stronger cross correlation of angle-resolved scattering properties on different imaging planes while the heterogeneity, observed in the malignant ovary, suggests a weaker correlation."

Initially, a virtual plan is generated based on the prescription dose and GEC-ESTRO defined OAR dose constraints with a pre-implant CT. After the actual implant, a regular diagnostic CT was obtained and fused with our pre-implant scan/initial treatment plan in our planning software. The Flexi-needle position changes, and treatment plan modifications were made if needed. Dose values were normalized to equivalent doses in 2 Gy fractions (LQED 2 Gy) derived from the linear-quadratic model with alpha/beta of 3 for late responding tissues and alpha/beta of 10 for early responding tissues. D(90) to the CTV, which was gross tumor (GTV) at the time of brachytherapy with a margin to count for microscopic disease, was 84.7 +/- 4.9% of the prescribed dose. The OAR doses were evaluated by D(2cc) (EBRT+IB). Mean D(2cc) values (LQED(2Gy)) for the rectum, bladder, sigmoid, and small bowel were the following: 63.7 +/- 8.4 Gy, 61.2 +/- 6.9 Gy, 48.0 +/- 3.5 Gy, and 49.9 +/- 4.2 Gy. This study confirms the feasibility of applying the GEC-ESTRO recommended dose parameters in pre-implant CT-based treatment planning in GYN IB. In the process, this pre-implant technique also demonstrates a good approximation of the target volume dose coverage, and doses to the OARs."

Eleven cases that we have encountered at the Department of Gynecology, Kitasato University Hospital, between 1971 and 2003 are presented. Of 1370 invasive carcinomas of the uterine cervix, the incidence of small-cell carcinoma was 0.8%. Patient ages ranged between 32 and 65 years, with a mean age of 46.3 years. The clinical stages at diagnosis were Ib in four patients, IIb in three, IIIb in three, and IVb in one. All patients presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Two patients who are alive with no evidence of disease for 12 years and 3 years 6 months, while eight patients died of primary carcinoma between 4 and 25 months after treatment. Histopathologic findings showed solid nests with marked peripheral palisading pattern and rosette formation. Small tumor cells with scant cytoplasm demonstrated a very high nuclear/cytoplasm ratio and indistinct cell borders. The nuclei were round to oval and demonstrated increased but fine granular chromatin. Nucleoli were indistinct in all cases. Immunohistochemical findings were positive in 81.8% each for neuron-specific enolase and protein gene product 9.5, 72.7% for synaptophysin, 63.6% for chromogranin A, and 54.5% for neural cell adhesion molecule. All specimens were positive for at least one of the above. In conclusion, small-cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix revealed poor prognosis. Making an accurate diagnosis of small-cell carcinoma before performing treatment is of great significance but often difficult. Immunohistochemical analysis using several kinds of neuroendocrine markers is helpful in establishing the correct diagnosis in addition to focusing on characteristic histo- and cytopathologic features."

CD011126,0,21611997,0,Endometrial cancer and ultrasound: why measuring endometrial thickness is sometimes not enough.,"Endometrial cancer is the commonest cancer of the female genital tract in the developed world. Ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness is commonly used to triage patients with postmenopausal bleeding for histological sampling. The sensitivity of ultrasound in diagnosing endometrial cancer is high, but it has a small, well-defined false-negative rate. In this report we describe two cases, with histological confirmation, of postmenopausal women without any vaginal bleeding, who were subsequently diagnosed with advanced endometrial cancer. They were found to have a thin, normal endometrium on ultrasound. In both cases, histological examination was suggestive of endometrial cancer originating from foci of adenomyosis. These findings suggest that a proportion of the false-negative diagnoses of endometrial cancer on ultrasound could be caused by the disease being confined to the myometrium rather than as a result of suboptimal performance of ultrasound examination."

CD011126,0,15162229,0,Pelvic endometriosis: US and MRI features.,"Endometriosis represents a common and important clinical problem of women of childbearing age. It is a disabling disorder manifesting with pain and infertility. The exact pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear, despite the different theories that have been formulated. The literature on endometriosis is extensive, but often in regard to classic endometrioma. It is surprising that, to the best of our knowledge, the many radiologic features of extraovarian endometriosis have not been well documented thus far. Although ultrasound (US) remains the imaging modality of choice in the radiologic evaluation of female patients with pelvic pain, the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of abdominal pain is expanding. In the young patient, MRI may be performed if a gynecologic disorder is not suspected at first, especially if US findings are equivocal or the abnormality extends beyond the field of view of the sonographic probe. Moreover, MRI is useful whenever further characterization of pelvic disorder is required. In fact, many causes of pelvic disorders and of endometriosis in particular demonstrate characteristic MRI findings. For these reasons, in this work we describe the protean US and MRI appearances of endometrial foci as encountered in daily experience."

CD011126,0,20567184,0,Modern evaluation of the endometrium.,"Abnormal uterine bleeding in women older than age 35 years, and certainly in menopausal patients, mandates evaluation, mainly to exclude cancer and hyperplasia, but also to better diagnose the source of the bleeding to appropriately manage the patient. In the past, dilation and curettage was the mainstay of diagnosis. This gave way to in-office suction pump-generated biopsies. Most recently, disposable biopsy instruments with their own internal piston to generate suction have become the standard of care. Rarely has such a technique received such widespread acceptance with such limited validation. Transvaginal ultrasonography, when technically feasible, is a noninvasive way to image the endometrial cavity. Saline-infusion sonohysterography is a subset of transvaginal ultrasonography reserved for patients in whom an adequate endometrial echo is not seen or when an endometrial echo is seen but not sufficiently thin. Appropriate understanding and use of transvaginal ultrasonography and addition of sonohysterography when necessary can allow a clinical algorithm that can triage patients with abnormal uterine bleeding to 1) no anatomic pathology best treated expectantly; 2) a global endometrial process, in which case random blind endometrial sampling is appropriate; or 3) a focal endometrial abnormality in which case endometrial sampling should be done with the visualization offered by hysteroscopy. Finally, the incidence of thick endometrial echo found incidentally in postmenopausal women with no bleeding is extremely high (10-17%) and should not trigger invasive endometrial sampling automatically."

CD011126,0,18155677,0,The DRE/DREF transcriptional regulatory system: a master key for cell proliferation.,"The coordinate expression of many cell proliferation-related genes is required for the cellular shift from the resting state into the proliferating state. One regulatory factor involved in this process, the transcription regulatory factor named DREF (DNA replication-related element-binding factor) was discovered in Drosophila and later found to have orthologues in other species including human. Drosophila DREF is a homo-dimer of a polypeptide of 709 amino acid residues, and shares about 22% identity in its amino acid sequence with the human homolog of 694 amino acid residues. The Drosophila DREF homo-dimer binds specifically to the DRE sequence (5'-TATCGATA) in the promoters of many DNA replication/ cell proliferation-related genes to activate their transcription, and the N-terminal region of DREF carries a domain for specific DRE-binding and homo-dimer formation. Ectopic expression of DREF in eye imaginal discs induces abnormal DNA synthesis, apoptosis and failure to differentiate. Conversely, expression of the dominant negative N-terminal region in larval salivary glands reduces endo-replication. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of DREF in vivo demonstrated its requirement for normal progression through the cell cycle and consequently for growth of imaginal discs and the endoreplicating organs. Both Drosophila and human DREF's interact genetically and physically with regulatory factors related to chromatin structures, suggesting that DREF activates the expression of proliferation-related genes through modification of the 3-D conformation of DNA. A search of the Drosophila genome database identified about 150 genes carrying DRE sequences in their promoter regions, many of which are related to reactions required for cell proliferation such as DNA replication, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle regulation, growth signal transduction and protein metabolism. Thus, DREF appears to be a master key-like factor for cell proliferation. Several differentiation-related transcription factors containing homeodomains down-regulate the function or expression of DREF by distinct mechanisms, suggesting a differentiation-coupled repression of cell proliferation via the DRE/DREF system."

Preoperative CT examination of the abdomen and MR imaging of the pelvis was performed in 67 women, with clinically or sonographically detected adnexal masses. The CT examinations were performed on a 16-row CT scanner, and the protocol included scanning of the abdomen during the portal phase, using a detector collimation of 16 x 0.75 mm and a pitch of 1.2. We used a 1.5-T magnet unit to perform T1, T2 and fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequences, before and after intravenous administration of gadolinium chelate compounds. The accuracy of multidetector CT and MR imaging in the differentiation between benign and malignant ovarian masses was evaluated, using histopathologic results as the standard of reference. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MDCT in the characterization of ovarian masses were 90.5%, 93.7% and 92.9%, respectively, and that of MR imaging 95.2%, 98.4% and 97.6%, respectively. Although MRI performed slightly better, this did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, both MDCT on a 16-row CT scanner and MR imaging demonstrated satisfactory results in the characterization of ovarian masses."
CD011126,0,20451820,0,MR colonography and MR enterography.,"The bowel is a common site for pathologic processes, including malignancies and inflammatory disease. Colorectal cancer accounts for 10% of all new cancers and 9% of cancer deaths. A significant decrease in the incidence of colorectal cancer and cancer death rates has been attributed to screening measures, earlier detection, and improved therapies. Virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography, is an effective method for detecting polyps. However, in light of increasing concerns about ionizing radiation exposure from medical imaging and potential increased risk of future radiation-induced malignancies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is seen as an increasingly attractive alternative. Improvements in MRI technology now permit three-dimensional volumetric imaging of the entire colon in a single breath hold at high spatial resolution, making VC with MRI possible."

Forty-one patients who had gallbladder lesions (polyps in 26, stones in 12, and sludge in 3) were enrolled in our study. A Voluson 730 Expert US scanner was used throughout. Volume contrast US imaging with slice thicknesses of 3, 5, 10 and 15 mm and tissue harmonic imaging of the gallbladder were obtained. Two abdominal radiologists reviewed the masked images and graded by consensus these images using a five-point scale [from grade 1, (best), to grade 5, (worst)], based on the sharpness of the anterior gallbladder wall, internal artifact, lesion conspicuity and acoustic shadowing from stone. Volume contrast US imaging with thin slice thicknesses (3 or 5 mm) was judged superior to both tissue harmonic imaging and with thick slice thicknesses (10 or 15 mm), with respect to the sharpness of the anterior wall and lesion conspicuity ( P<0.001). In terms of internal artifact, volume contrast imaging with thin slice thicknesses was significantly superior to both tissue harmonic imaging and volume contrast imaging with a 15 mm thickness ( P<0.001) and was judged to be marginally better than with a 10 mm thickness ( p>0.01). With regard to acoustic shadowing, volume contrast imaging with thin slice thicknesses was also significantly better than with thick slice thicknesses ( P<0.01), and it was also marginally better than tissue harmonic imaging ( P>0.01).

Digitally stored grayscale sonographic images from a random sample of 98 women with an adnexal mass submitted to surgery after a grayscale transvaginal sonography were evaluated by five different examiners with different degrees of experience in three European university departments of obstetrics and gynecology. Masses in which the echo features were highly characteristic of a benign pathology were categorized as benign. Any cystic mass containing excrescences, thick septations, multiple irregular septations or solid component in which the echo architecture was not highly suggestive of benign histology was categorized as malignant. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement according to the level of experience were assessed by calculating the kappa index. Of the 98 cases randomly selected, 28 (29%) were malignant masses and 70 (71%) were benign. Intraobserver agreement was good or very good for all examiners with different degrees of experience (kappa = 0.72 to 1). Interobserver agreement was good for all expert operators (kappa = 0.69 to 0.75). Interobserver agreement between experts and highly experienced operators was moderate or good (kappa = 0.51 to 0.63). Interobserver agreement between the moderately experienced operator and experts was fair to moderate (kappa = 0.29 to 0.46).

CD011126,0,15549259,0,Surgical treatment of ureteral obstruction from endometriosis: our experience with thirteen cases.,"Endometriosis is a biologically benign albeit aggressive pathology marked by high local recurrences. Ureteral involvement accounts for only a minority of cases (0.1-0.4%) with often non-specific symptoms at clinical presentation and difficult preoperative diagnosis. Thirteen cases of severe ureteral endometriosis (i.e. causing significant obstruction to the urinary flow) were observed and surgically treated, out of 17 ureteral units affected (three cases of bilateral involvement, one case of complete pyeloureteral duplicity). The initial symptomatology was acute and related to ureteral obstruction in eight cases, silent and non-specific in the other five; a presumptive diagnosis was made only for the seven patients (53.9%) with a positive medical history for pelvic (and in two cases also ureteral) endometriosis. Preoperative drainage of urine proved necessary for eight patients due to the complete functional exclusion of the excretory axis. One patient (7.7%) underwent nephrectomy due to renal atrophy. Segmental ureteral resection and termino-terminal anastomosis were performed in two patients, while seven patients underwent segmental ureterectomy and ureterocystoneostomy, with bladder psoas hitching in four cases and vesical flap according to Casati-Boari in one case. All three cases of bilateral involvement were treated by bilateral segmental ureterectomy and trans-uretero-uretero-cystoneostomy with bladder psoas hitching. Following histological examination, all patients were diagnosed with active ureteral endometriosis, which was found to be intrinsic in five cases (38.5%) and extrinsic in the other eight. One of the two patients that had undergone ureterectomy and termino-terminal anastomosis had to undergo ureteral resection and ureterocystoneostomy 22 months later due to relapsing endometriosis-induced stenosis. Conversely, no ureteral endometriosis relapses occurred in the remaining 12 patients within the mean follow-up time of 41.1 months (range 6-91). Ureteral endometriosis is marked by non-specific symptoms, making preoperative diagnosis often difficult. Therefore, an ultrasound or urographic examination of the urinary tract in case of pelvic endometriosis is absolutely essential. In our experience, terminal ureterectomy with ureterocystoneostomy has provided long-term favourable results as extended ureteral resection can be performed and continuity of the urinary tract can be restored without resorting to the distal pelvic ureter, which is often affected by the disease besides being more subject to relapses."

For cervix carcinoma the prognosis is better for compact shapes than for diffusive shapes since the latter may already indicate invasion, the stage in tumor progression that precedes the formation of metastases. In this paper, we present methods for describing and evaluating tumor objects and their surfaces based on topological and geometric properties. For geometry, statistics of the binary object's distance transform are used to evaluate the tumor's invasion front. In addition, a simple compactness measure is adapted to 3D images and presented to compare different types of tumor samples. As a topological measure, the Betti numbers are calculated of voxelized tumor objects based on a medial axis transform. We further illustrate how these geometric and topological properties can be used for a quantitative comparison of histological material and single-cell-based tumor growth simulations."

Whatever the aetiology of preterm delivery, dilation of the cervix is a common endpoint, and transvaginal scanning of the cervix now provides a good predictor of early preterm delivery in both high- and low-risk women. Changes in the cervix are related to the detection of fetal fibronectin in the vagina, which is also an accurate predictor of delivery. However, the role of intervention in at-risk women is unclear.

CD011126,0,25973906,0,A Split-and-Merge-Based Uterine Fibroid Ultrasound Image Segmentation Method in HIFU Therapy.,"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy has been used to treat uterine fibroids widely and successfully. Uterine fibroid segmentation plays an important role in positioning the target region for HIFU therapy. Presently, it is completed by physicians manually, reducing the efficiency of therapy. Thus, computer-aided segmentation of uterine fibroids benefits the improvement of therapy efficiency. Recently, most computer-aided ultrasound segmentation methods have been based on the framework of contour evolution, such as snakes and level sets. These methods can achieve good performance, although they need an initial contour that influences segmentation results. It is difficult to obtain the initial contour automatically; thus, the initial contour is always obtained manually in many segmentation methods. A split-and-merge-based uterine fibroid segmentation method, which needs no initial contour to ensure less manual intervention, is proposed in this paper. The method first splits the image into many small homogeneous regions called superpixels. A new feature representation method based on texture histogram is employed to characterize each superpixel. Next, the superpixels are merged according to their similarities, which are measured by integrating their Quadratic-Chi texture histogram distances with their space adjacency. Multi-way Ncut is used as the merging criterion, and an adaptive scheme is incorporated to decrease manual intervention further. The method is implemented using Matlab on a personal computer (PC) platform with Intel Pentium Dual-Core CPU E5700. The method is validated on forty-two ultrasound images acquired from HIFU therapy. The average running time is 9.54 s. Statistical results showed that SI reaches a value as high as 87.58%, and normHD is 5.18% on average. It has been demonstrated that the proposed method is appropriate for segmentation of uterine fibroids in HIFU pre-treatment imaging and planning."

CD011126,0,22084183,0,saline-infused sonohysterography: tips for achieving greater success.,"Saline-infused sonohysterography (SIS) may help improve visualization of the endometrium and endometrial cavity and assess tubal patency. Although most SIS procedures are straightforward, a variety of pitfalls may lead to an unsuccessful procedure or incomplete evaluation. SIS should be scheduled between days 4 and 10 of the patient's menstrual cycle, when the endometrium is at its thinnest, and physiologic changes during the secretory phase are not present. Performing preprocedure imaging serves many purposes, such as depicting hydrosalpinx, causes of uterine and adnexal tenderness, and pelvic inflammatory disease, as well as assessing the size and position of the uterus and the orientation of the cervix. It is important not to presume that fibroids are the cause of bleeding when the endometrium is obscured at preprocedure imaging. Obstacles to a successful procedure include issues related to patient anxiety and discomfort, which may be prevented or minimized at almost every step of the procedure. Inability to obtain access to the cervix is the most common cause of unsuccessful SIS; proper patient positioning in a semi-upright lithotomy position is important. Injection of air during any US-guided procedure may lead to shadowing that obscures the region of interest. Adequate distention of the endometrial cavity is crucial for successful SIS, and optimal positioning of the distended balloon may improve the degree of distention. However, poor distention may be indicative of an underlying pathologic condition. Knowledge of these pitfalls and the strategies to overcome them may prevent premature or unnecessary termination of an otherwise successful study."

Although the cause of her free air and pain was determined to be iatrogenic and ultimately benign, this complication is previously unreported and, without complaints of abdominal pain, presented a diagnostic challenge."

We compared several surrogate indexes of visceral adiposity with ultrasound assessment of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue depots in 99 young Caucasian adults, including 20 women without androgen excess, 53 women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and 26 men. Obesity was present in 7, 21, and 7 subjects, respectively. We obtained body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), model of adipose distribution (MOAD), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and ultrasound measurements of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue depots and hepatic steatosis. WC and BMI showed the strongest correlations with ultrasound measurements of visceral adiposity. Only WHR correlated with sex hormones. Linear stepwise regression models including VAI were only slightly stronger than models including BMI or WC in explaining the variability in the insulin sensitivity index (yet BMI and WC had higher individual standardized coefficients of regression), and these models were superior to those including WHR and MOAD. WC showed 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.88-0.99) and BMI showed 0.91 (0.85-0.98) probability of identifying the presence of hepatic steatosis according to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In conclusion, WC and BMI not only the simplest to obtain, but are also the most accurate surrogate markers of visceral adiposity in young adults, and are good indicators of insulin resistance and powerful predictors of the presence of hepatic steatosis."

CD011126,0,17354913,0,Virtual fly-over: a new visualization technique for virtual colonoscopy.,"In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique for virtual colonoscopy (VC). The proposed method is called Virtual Fly-Over, which splits the entire colon anatomy into exactly two halves. Then, it assigns a virtual camera to each half to perform fly-over navigation, which has several advantages over both traditional fly-through and related methods. First, by controlling the elevation of the camera, there is no restriction on its field of view (FOV) angle (e.g., >90 degrees) to maximize visualized surface areas, and hence no perspective distortion. Second, the camera viewing volume is perpendicular to each colon half, so potential polyps that are hidden behind haustral folds are easily found. Finally, because the orientation of the splitting surface is controllable, the navigation can be repeated at a different split orientation to overcome the problem of having a polyp that is divided between the two halves of the colon. Quantitative experimental results on 15 clinical datasets have shown that the average surface visibility coverage is 99.59 +/- 0.2%."

TVS was normal in 32 women, while in the others polyps or fibroids projecting into the cavity (n = 19) or a thick endometrium (n = 19) were suspected. On performing SISH the uterine cavity was found to be normal in 29 women, while 35 had suspected polyps/fibroids and 6 had other abnormalities. Hysteroscopy proved to be normal in 28 women, 35 had polyps/fibroids and 7 had other abnormalities. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for TVS were 72.4%, 100%, 100% and 74%, respectively, while for SISH the corresponding figures were 91.4%, 92.6%, 89.3% and 94.1%.

ASM is a rare disorder characterized by uni- or multilocular extensions of the meninges from the sacral spinal canal to the retroperitoneal presacral space. Common symptoms include lower back and pelvic pain, constipation, difficulties in defecation, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, and urinary incontinence, retention or urgency. Perineal and lower-extremity paresthesias may present when nerve roots are affected. Despite its more posterior location, ASM can mimic an ovarian cyst or other adnexal cystic mass, and in the obstetric patient can present a mechanical obstacle to delivery with a risk of rupture and infection during labor and delivery. Although it is a rare condition, we feel that awareness of the etiology, presentation and imaging characteristics of ASM is of importance and have therefore carried out a review of the literature, taking into account case findings and the obstetric and gynecological management of this disorder."

CD011126,0,23712277,0,[Current developments and perspectives on the diagnosis and treatment of urinary incontinence and genital prolapse in women].,"As a key area of gynaecology, urogynaecology has undergone impressive changes in the past few years. Together with the high prevalence of functional pelvic floor disorders, modern anaesthesia procedures and the introduction of new, innovative minimally invasive operation techniques have led to a dramatic increase in the number of operations for incontinence and prolapses. The increasingly subtle diagnostic options, such as, e. g., 2D and 3D sonography of the pelvic floor provide unambiguous findings and facilitate decision making. Tension-free vaginal slings in retro-pubic, trans-obturator or single-incision techniques show a high success rate with few complications and have almost completely replaced the more invasive abdominal surgical techniques for the operative management of stress incontinence. Especially for recurrent prolapse the use of alloplastic nets leads to a markedly improved anatomic and functional outcome. In spite of the euphoria about modern operation techniques and novel net materials, in-depth knowledge of pelvic floor anatomy, sufficient surgical experience and unequivocal guideline-conform indications are mandatory for satisfactory treatment outcomes. The afflicted women must be informed in detail about alternative procedures and more emphasis should be placed on conservative therapy. Novel surgical techniques should be monitored by registers or clinical trials. The professional society is called upon to improve the training curricula for pelvic floor surgery."

CD011126,0,14680786,0,[Revelation of a polymicrocystic ovary syndrome after one month's treatment by pulsatile GnRH in a patient presenting with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea].,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) are the most frequent causes of endocrine infertility, but their association is an uncommon occurrence. We report the case of a 28-year old woman suffering from infertility and amenorrhea. Her weight was normal (BMI = 19) and she had no hirsutism. She self-reported food restriction and a 10 kg weight loss 5 years ago, concomitant with the onset of amenorrhea. At the initial evaluation, the patient was considered as having HA due to food restriction. At ultrasonography, ovaries were small and multifollicular (right and left area: 2.2 and 2.5 cm(2), respectively; number of cysts 2-9 mm in diameter: 15 and 12, respectively), and no stromal hypertrophy was noted. She has been treated for 1 month by intravenous pulsatile GnRH administration. Although the doses were increased from 5 to 15 microg/pulse every 90 min, no E2 response and no follicular development were observed. Hormonal re-evaluation revealed normal levels of serum LH, FSH and androgens, and a normal LH/FSH ratio. However, a typical aspect of PCO was found at ultrasound (right and left area: 6.5 and 5.5 cm(2), respectively, and more than 15 small cysts arranged peripherally around an increased central stroma in each ovary). The treatment has been then switched to hMG, using the low dose step-up regimen and starting with 75 U/day. In the absence of response after 2 weeks, the dose was increased to 112.5 U/day and a multifollicular reaction occurred, leading to cancellation. In conclusion, we hypothesize that this patient had a ""hidden"" PCOS when she was hypogonadotrophic and that it developed very rapidly after restitution of a normal gonadotropin level under exogenous GnRH. This occurred despite a low insulin level, showing that hyperinsulinism is not a prerequisite for the development of PCOS in every case."

However, neither elasticity nor its clinical correlate, muscle resting tone, have received much attention to date. We therefore conducted a prospective study to test a newly developed resting tone scale for validity and reproducibility. Ninety-eight patients underwent a physical examination including prolapse staging and palpation of the levator ani. They were also assessed by 4D translabial ultrasound for levator hiatal dimensions and prolapse assessment. Resting tone was negatively associated with anterior and posterior compartment prolapse. An independent test-retest series yielded a weighted kappa of 0.55 (CI 0.44-0.66), implying ""moderate"" repeatability. Resting tone of the puborectalis muscle can be determined by digital palpation. It is moderately repeatable and associated with pelvic organ prolapse. Palpation of resting tone may be a useful new tool for assessing women with pelvic floor dysfunction."

Real-time identification of the target region and accurate control of the temperature evolution during the treatment are now possible. Thermal ablation of pathological tissue, local drug delivery using thermosensitive microcarriers and controlled transgene expression using thermosensitive promoters have recently been demonstrated with this unique technology, and based on these experiments the combination of focussed ultrasound and MRI thermometry holds promise for future oncological diagnostics and treatment.

Sixteen consecutive infertile women were recruited for this trial. All subjects underwent clinically indicated MR-HSG: 10-15 ml of 1:10 solution of gadolinium and normal sterile saline (0.9%) was gently hand-injected intracervically through a 7 French balloon catheter while seven consecutive flash-3D dynamic (FL 3D DY) T1-weighted MR sequences were acquired. Two readers independently assessed image quality as well as anatomic and pathologic correlations. Patient comfort was evaluated using a specific score questionnaire. MR-HSG was successfully completed in all patients. In 14/16 (87.4%) patients, MR-HSG showed bilateral tubal patency with symmetric contrast agent diffusion and a regular tubo-ovarian relationship. One patient (6.3%) with monolateral hydrosalpinx presented no contrast agent diffusion in the affected side (monolateral tubal occlusion); in another patient (6.3%) the fallopian tube was displaced upward causing loss of the tubo-ovarian anatomical relationship resulting in asymmetric and inadequate contrast agent diffusion. Eight women (50%) were found to have abnormalities on MR imaging; these abnormalities included multi follicular ovaries (5 cases 31.1%), endometrioma (1 case, 6.3%), leiomyoma (1 case/6.3%) and endometrial polyp (1 case/6.3%). The average time required for the study was 25-30 minutes. Analysis of the questionnaires administered to the patients showed that 15/16 patients (93.7%) were fully satisfied with the procedure. All examinations were judged to be of high diagnostic quality and the two readers made similar diagnoses. In conclusion, MR-HSG is a feasible, useful and well tolerated tool for the assessment of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and extra-uterine structures. MR-HSG is a new promising imaging approach to female infertility."
CD011126,0,16789618,0,Image diagnosis in McCune-Albright syndrome.,"McCune-Albright syndrome consists of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, precocious puberty and cafè-au-lait skin lesions. Bone lesions are characterized by the presence of fibrous connective tissue with a characteristic whorled pattern and containing trabeculae of immature non-lamellar (woven) bone. They may be solitary (monostotic) or multiple (polyostotic). Commonly involved bones include the femur, tibia, ribs and facial skeleton. In the fibula pseudo-cystic areas and 'ground glass'-like areas, in the femur 'shepherd crook' deformation due to weight on a less resistant bone and secondary to many cortical microfractures, are typical. MRI gives the exact delimitation of the lesions and is especially indicated in the followup of monostotic forms and in the outcome of surgical corrections. Bone scintigraphy with technetium 99 is essential in the follow-up of the disease.

Three women developed combined jugular and subclavian vein thrombosis following OHSS related to assisted reproductive technologies. The imaging modalities used for diagnosis were a bimode Doppler ultrasound, MRI of the neck in two women, computed tomography (CT) angiography and venography in one. Targeted ultrasound identified the rudimentary cysts in all patients, whereas CT angiography performed with contrast material failed to detect the cyst, which resembled a vessel with thrombus in the lumen. MRI performed at the same level did detect the cyst; however, MRI of the neck requires special attention using a dedicated cystic protocol at the base of the neck. Venography was performed in one patient; it demonstrated the thrombosed vein possibly with some extrinsic compression, but it could not define a cyst. Targeted ultrasound is the simplest and best imaging modality for discerning rudimentary cysts in pregnant women with OHSS who present with jugular and subclavian vein thrombosis following assisted reproductive technology. A search for the cyst at the time of OHSS is important, as early detection could decrease the risk of developing thrombosis."

Her symptoms did not disappear after cholecystectomy, even though echography showed no further abnormality. In a 46-year-old man with fever and weight loss, echography revealed two polyps in the gallbladder. Following cholecystectomy, histopathology revealed cholesterol polyps and an infection with Entamoeba coli. In a 63-year-old man with systemic symptoms, a biopsy of the echographically diagnosed tumour of the gallbladder revealed that he had actually had cholecystitis. The management was wait-and-see and the patient recovered completely. In a 68-year-old woman with jaundice and attacks of abdominal pain, a CT-scan revealed gallstones. The symptoms recurred following an ERCP. Following cholecystectomy, an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder was found. One year later, a contact metastasis developed forwhich she received radiotherapy. After 4 years she was in good condition. Patients with a tumour in the gallbladder are often diagnosed with gallbladder cancer, which has a poor prognosis. Other diseases should also be considered, since the treatment and prognosis differ greatly. It is important to differentiate at an early stage.

CD011126,0,7789918,0,Transvaginal ultrasonographic morphology in polycystic ovarian syndrome.,"To assess the morphological findings based on transvaginal ultrasound, the ovarian volume and the number and size of small follicles were studied in 47 patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed clinically. Thirty normal volunteers served as controls. The mean ovarian volume (10.3 ml) and number of follicles (10.6) in patients with PCOS were significantly higher than those of controls. An ovarian volume > 6.2 ml and follicles > 10 with a diameter of 2-8 mm were the most prominent features in the ovaries of patients with PCOS and 94% of 47 patients with PCOS had at least one of these ultrasonic findings. However, marked asymmetry of the two ovaries was seen in about 50% of patients with PCOS and a considerable overlap existed between controls and patients with PCOS in the ovarian volume and in the number of follicles. Three (6%) patients with normal ovarian volume and normal number of follicles were observed. Therefore, it is difficult to clearly distinguish a patient with PCOS from a normal woman only by transvaginal ultrasonic criteria using the ovarian volume and/or the number of follicles, although these criteria could be clinically useful for the screening of PCOS."

The HTT of contrast agent (Sonovue(R); Bracco International B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was measured in patients with liver metastases on the basis of time intensity curve (TIC(R)) before and after RFA, respectively. Changes of HTT before vs after RFA were compared with therapeutic response based on three-phase dynamic CT or MRI. Before RFA HTT in all 5 patients was less than 10 s (mean 6.2+/-1.5 s). After RFA HTT in patients with complete therapeutic response was 11.3+/-1.2 s, whereas two patients with incomplete treatment showed unchanged HTT below 10 s (mean 6.3+/-1.8 s). Successful RFA leads to a normalization in HTT. HTT using ultrasound contrast agent appears to provide a new and alternative approach in assessing the therapeutic effect of RFA in liver metastases."
CD011126,0,21410349,0,Imaging in gynecologic surgery.,"The technical development of instruments for endoscopic surgery started in the field of gynecology. In the early 1970s, with the improvement of optics and instruments for laparoscopic surgery, gyne-endoscopic surgery developed and set milestones for all other surgical fields. However, the general surgeons propagated the advantages of 2D or 3D imaging surgery much better than the conservative gynecologists. Surgery on a 2D screen without direct vision is regarded as more advantageous than open surgery and has achieved wide acceptance. Several schools of gynecologic endoscopy in Europe (in Kiel, Giessen, Clermont Ferrand and Strasbourg) have set guidelines for gyne-endoscopic surgery. Our catalog of indications in the areas of gyne-endoscopic surgery, published in 2002, reveals the broad application of these techniques today. 3D vision, robotic instruments and systems, such as the da Vinci(®) Surgical System from Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (CA, USA), round up the picture of endoscopic surgery. The advantages of endoscopic surgery over open surgery (more precision, less trauma, less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays and a faster recovery period) are becoming more accepted. The present healthcare systems and hospital administrations understand the challenges of imaging in surgery, particularly in endoscopic surgery."
CD011126,0,16417732,0,Influence of oral contraceptive pills on phenotype expression in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by a heterogeneous phenotype including chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. The use of oral contraceptive pills (OCP) alters features characteristic for the syndrome. In the present study, PCOS features were compared between women using or not using OCP at the time of the study. One hundred and one women diagnosed with normogonadotrophic anovulatory infertility were included. A total of 81 (80%) women were diagnosed with PCOS (revised 2003 criteria). From these women, a total of 54 did not use OCP, whereas 27 women did. Corrected for age, women taking OCP had increased serum concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (P < 0.001). Serum concentrations of testosterone (P = 0.04) and androstenedione (P = 0.01) were decreased. These differences resulted in a decreased free androgen index for women currently taking OCP compared with women without (P < 0.001). The mean ovarian volume/ovary and the mean follicle number/ovary were not different. Use of OCP influences phenotype expression (the observable trait) of individual women known to suffer from PCOS by reducing hyperandrogenism. Despite taking OCP, women still fulfilled the revised 2003 criteria for the syndrome, as PCO morphology was still present. Hence, OCP use does not appreciably affect the PCOS phenotype."

To diagnose atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or not to diagnose?].,"The classification of pap smears according to the Bethesda System introduced to the cytologic diagnostics atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). From the moment of the introduction this term arises many controversies because morphological criteria proposed for the determining ASCUS are very subjective. Even most experienced cytologists not always are able to correct diagnosis of ASCUS. There are also doubts in the clinical procedure connected with the recognition ASCUS. To diminish doubts to the minimum appeared several proposals categorization of ASCUS. The cytologic diagnosis of ASCUS is a serious dilemma both clinical and considerable economic problem. There are suggestions of the elimination from the Bethesda System recognition ASCUS. Many authors it maintains that there is no reason to qualify atypical cells as ASCUS because it can be an image of the occurrence cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The hope is that the three-dimensional microscopy, HPV DNA testing, cellular biomarkers, involvement of the cytology to colposcopic research considerably will decrease the number of incorrect diagnoses of ASCUS with the advantage for the clinical procedure. In light of opinions introduced in this paper it appears that the diagnostics ASCUS is legitimate. It is necessary to perform precise microscopic analysis of morphology observed cellules. The recognition of ASCUS one ought to place only exceptionally remembering simultaneously about clinical consequences of such diagnosis."

CD011126,0,21190479,0,The technique of laparoscopic pelvic ultrasonography for metastatic lymph node.,"Many reports have provided evidence to support the effective use of diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) to determine if patients with upper abdominal malignant diseases are operable so that unnecessary laparotomy can be avoided. LUS is less frequently applied to patients with pelvic malignancies and this is probably related to the technical difficulties. We have developed the LUS technique in examining the pelvic nodes for metastasis systematically and have applied it to 241 cervical cancer patients. The procedure is safe and not associated with any major morbidity. The mean duration of pelvic node assessment by LUS is 14 minutes and the procedure can be satisfactorily completed in 98% of patients. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of LUS in detecting pelvic nodal metastasis were 81.2%, 55.6%, 88.4%, 57.7%, and 87.5%, respectively, in patients scheduled for radical hysterectomy. In this report, we describe the LUS technique in detail and demonstrate important landmarks that provide useful orientation during an LUS examination. The technical limitations and pitfalls are also discussed."

CD011126,0,24120049,0,Engineering of perfluorooctylbromide polypyrrole nano-/microcapsules for simultaneous contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging and photothermal treatment of cancer.,"A versatile oil-in-water emulsion method has been explored for constructing water-dispersible polypyrrole (PPy) nano-/microcapsules with a soluble PPy complex as multifunctional photothermal agents for tumor ablation. In this work, both PPy nanocapsules (280.4 ± 79.0 nm) and microcapsules (1.31 ± 0.45 μm) with liquid perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB) core could be obtained by simply tuning the process energy for emulsion formation from ultrasonication to homogenization. Owing to the encapsulated liquid PFOB and strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption of PPy shell, the resulted PPy capsules showed great promise in ultrasound imaging guided photothermal ablation of tumor cells without inducing any significant side effect. Thus, it is anticipated that fine-tuning of the other encapsulated drugs or functional materials in PPy capsules would foster avenues for the development of multifunctional platforms for cancer treatments."

CD011126,0,25658334,0,Segmentation of tumor ultrasound image in HIFU therapy based on texture and boundary encoding.,"It is crucial in high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy to detect the tumor precisely with less manual intervention for enhancing the therapy efficiency. Ultrasound image segmentation becomes a difficult task due to signal attenuation, speckle effect and shadows. This paper presents an unsupervised approach based on texture and boundary encoding customized for ultrasound image segmentation in HIFU therapy. The approach oversegments the ultrasound image into some small regions, which are merged by using the principle of minimum description length (MDL) afterwards. Small regions belonging to the same tumor are clustered as they preserve similar texture features. The mergence is completed by obtaining the shortest coding length from encoding textures and boundaries of these regions in the clustering process. The tumor region is finally selected from merged regions by a proposed algorithm without manual interaction. The performance of the method is tested on 50 uterine fibroid ultrasound images from HIFU guiding transducers. The segmentations are compared with manual delineations to verify its feasibility. The quantitative evaluation with HIFU images shows that the mean true positive of the approach is 93.53%, the mean false positive is 4.06%, the mean similarity is 89.92%, the mean norm Hausdorff distance is 3.62% and the mean norm maximum average distance is 0.57%. The experiments validate that the proposed method can achieve favorable segmentation without manual initialization and effectively handle the poor quality of the ultrasound guidance image in HIFU therapy, which indicates that the approach is applicable in HIFU therapy."

We report the case of a 32-year-old man with polyorchidism, presenting with primary infertility with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia semen profile. Scrotal examination revealed two discrete ovoid nontender, firm, mobile lumps with testicular sensation in the right side of the scrotum. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of double testes with double separate epididymides sharing a common vas deferens in the right side of the scrotum. It demonstrated similar echo texture and vascular flow in both right-sided testicles although smaller in size than the left testis. The case was managed conservatively without surgical intervention with follow-up. Tracing of similar conditions in the literature was discussed."

CD011126,0,14763908,0,Precocious puberty secondary to massive ovarian oedema in a 6-month-old girl.,"A 6-month-old girl was referred with breast and pubic hair development. Investigations excluded an adrenal or central cause for her precocity. Ovarian ultrasound scans showed bilaterally enlarged ovaries with both solid and cystic changes. A follow-up examination suggested progression of the precocity and in view of the young age of the child, and concerns regarding underlying malignancy, she underwent laparotomy. Histology showed no evidence of neoplasia but there was stromal oedema consistent with a diagnosis of massive ovarian oedema. This entity is poorly recognised in the paediatric literature as a cause of sexual precocity, and has never previously been described in such a young patient. This is an unusual cause of precocity in a young child and its recognition and management are reviewed."

CD011126,0,15123060,0,The use of mathematical models to evaluate pelvic masses; can they beat an expert operator?,"The pre-operative characterization of ovarian cysts remains a major challenge. Functional cysts and some other benign cysts should be managed conservatively, whereas persistent tumours may need removal. It is crucial to distinguish between malignant tumours, which are better treated by a gynaecological oncologist, and benign tumours, which may be suitable for minimal-access surgery. Over the past decade several ultrasound-based morphological scoring systems, colour Doppler parameters, logistic regression models and artificial neural networks have been proposed and tested in order to try to predict the histology of ovarian tumours. On prospective testing none of the current models can beat an expert sonologist. Signs of malignancy include the presence of papillary structures, irregular solid areas, septa and a strong vascularization at colour Doppler imaging. Further refinement of mathematical models and the results of multicentre trials need to be reviewed before the clinical use of mathematical models can be advocated."
CD011126,0,15123061,0,The role of ultrasound in the management of women with acute and chronic pelvic pain.,"Pelvic pain (acute or chronic) is a common symptom in women of all ages. Ultrasonography is the least invasive investigative tool available to the clinician. Transvaginal probes produce high-resolution images of the pelvic organs, providing reliable and reproducible information without the need for a full bladder. Common gynaecological pathology involving the uterus, Fallopian tube and/or the ovary can be diagnosed with confidence. Non-gynaecological pathology involving the bowel can also be diagnosed with accuracy, and will often be seen in the acute gynaecological setting. Ultrasound can be used to triage patients into appropriate treatment protocols, enabling the clinician to avoid surgery in some cases and select the correct surgical approach in others. If the patient has a negative pregnancy test, no pelvic tenderness on bimanual examination and a normal scan, significant pathology is very unlikely."
CD011126,0,15123062,0,Managing women with post-menopausal bleeding.,"Transvaginal ultrasound examination can reliably distinguish women with post-menopausal bleeding (PMB) who are at low risk of endometrial pathology (endometrial thickness < or =4 mm) from those who are at high risk (endometrium > or =5 mm) and can rule out focally growing lesions in the uterine cavity using saline infusion into the cavity as a negative contrast agent (hydrosonography). The 5 mm cut-off is applicable irrespective of the use of hormone replacement therapy. It is justified to refrain from endometrial sampling in women with PMB and an endometrial thickness of < or =4 mm because the risk of endometrial cancer in these women is low (0.1-1.0%). However, it is not known whether these women need follow-up. About 80% of women with PMB and an endometrium of > or =5 mm have focally growing pathological lesions in the uterine cavity. These should be removed by operative hysteroscopy because dilatation and curettage (D and C) will fail to diagnose and remove a large proportion of these lesions. However, D and C is a reliable diagnostic method for women without focal lesions in the uterine cavity. It is not known whether simple outpatient sampling devices (e.g. Pipelle) are as reliable as D and C in women without focal lesions. A measurement of endometrial thickness is a simple and accurate method for estimating the risk of endometrial cancer. The reliability of ultrasound evaluation of endometrial morphology and/or vascularization for risk estimation of endometrial malignancy remains to be determined."
CD011126,0,15123063,0,Investigating abnormal bleeding on HRT or tamoxifen: the role of ultrasonography.,In western countries hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a widely used therapeutic and/or preventive medication in post-menopausal women. Its impact on the endometrium has been extensively investigated. The critical issue is whether and how to monitor the endometrium in women who are taking HRT. Transvaginal ultrasound is a potential candidate for this role. Evidence for the efficiency of transvaginal sonography (TVS) in this context is limited. The criteria used to define a normal or abnormal result in women taking HRT are based largely on data from post-menopausal women who are not taking this treatment. This extrapolation is probably reasonable as long as some degree of caution is used. The use of normative data from post-menopausal women for those taking selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SORMs) is not advised and should be utilized only in the context of research studies as insufficient data exist on which to base cut-off values to discriminate between normal and abnormal endometria.
CD011126,0,16733508,0,First trimester screening for congenital heart disease.,"Most obstetrical practices in the United States offer pregnant women at least one ultrasound during pregnancy. This prenatal ultrasound is usually scheduled at around 18 to 20 weeks gestation. Both the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that the four-chamber view be included to screen for congenital heart disease. Recently, many investigators have attempted to screen for congenital heart disease earlier in pregnancy. Fetal nuchal translucency thickness traditionally used to screen for fetal aneuploidy by transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound has also been shown to identify a large proportion of fetuses with congenital heart disease. Recent studies have also reported congenital heart disease in chromosomally normal fetuses with increased nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester. Advances in ultrasound technology and training over the last 10 years allow greater visualization rates of the four-chamber view and outflow tracks in the late first trimester (up to 90% visualization at 13 weeks). Fetal echocardiography in the first trimester may be indicated for fetuses at risk for congenital heart disease. In this article we present a review of the most recent and ongoing clinical and basic research to support an earlier first trimester approach to diagnosing congenital heart defects."

CD011126,0,24290941,0,Gallbladder shape extraction from ultrasound images using active contour models.,"Gallbladder function is routinely assessed using ultrasonographic (USG) examinations. In clinical practice, doctors very often analyse the gallbladder shape when diagnosing selected disorders, e.g. if there are turns or folds of the gallbladder, so extracting its shape from USG images using supporting software can simplify a diagnosis that is often difficult to make. The paper describes two active contour models: the edge-based model and the region-based model making use of a morphological approach, both designed for extracting the gallbladder shape from USG images. The active contour models were applied to USG images without lesions and to those showing specific disease units, namely, anatomical changes like folds and turns of the gallbladder as well as polyps and gallstones. This paper also presents modifications of the edge-based model, such as the method for removing self-crossings and loops or the method of dampening the inflation force which moves nodes if they approach the edge being determined. The user is also able to add a fragment of the approximated edge beyond which neither active contour model will move if this edge is incomplete in the USG image. The modifications of the edge-based model presented here allow more precise results to be obtained when extracting the shape of the gallbladder from USG images than if the morphological model is used."

The GnRH stimulation test was performed in a cohort of young female patients who presented at our hospital for the evaluation of early signs of puberty. Using receiver operating curves (ROCs), the sensitivity and specificity of basal luteinising hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), basal and stimulated LH/FSH ratio, oestradiol levels and ultrasonographic parameters were evaluated at each level, and the area under curve (AUC) was measured. One hundred female children were assessed. We found that LH levels, peak LH/FSH ratio, fundal/cervical ratio, uterus length, and ovarian volume were reliable predictors of central precocious puberty (CPP).

A review of the literature.,"Endometriosis is a chronic benign gynecologic disease that can cause pelvic pain and infertility affecting almost 10% of reproductive-age women. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is a specific entity responsible for painful symptoms which are related to the anatomic location of the lesions. Definitive diagnosis requires surgery, and histological confirmation is advisable. The aim of this paper is to review the current literature regarding the possibility of diagnosing DIE accurately before surgery. Despite its low sensitivity and specificity, vaginal examination and evaluation of specific symptoms should not be completely omitted as a basic diagnostic tool in detecting endometriosis and planning further therapeutic interventions. Recently, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) has been reported as an excellent tool to diagnose DIE lesions in different locations (rectovaginal septum, retrocervical and paracervical areas, rectum and sigmoid, and vesical wall) with good accuracy."

CD011126,0,24849517,0,The polycystic ovary syndrome: a position statement from the European Society of Endocrinology.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common ovarian disorder associated with androgen excess in women, which justifies the growing interest of endocrinologists. Great efforts have been made in the last 2 decades to define the syndrome. The presence of three different definitions for the diagnosis of PCOS reflects the phenotypic heterogeneity of the syndrome. Major criteria are required for the diagnosis, which in turn identifies different phenotypes according to the combination of different criteria. In addition, the relevant impact of metabolic issues, specifically insulin resistance and obesity, on the pathogenesis of PCOS, and the susceptibility to develop earlier than expected glucose intolerance states, including type 2 diabetes, has supported the notion that these aspects should be considered when defining the PCOS phenotype and planning potential therapeutic strategies in an affected subject. This paper offers a critical endocrine and European perspective on the debate on the definition of PCOS and summarises all major aspects related to aetiological factors, including early life events, potentially involved in the development of the disorder. Diagnostic tools of PCOS are also discussed, with emphasis on the laboratory evaluation of androgens and other potential biomarkers of ovarian and metabolic dysfunctions. We have also paid specific attention to the role of obesity, sleep disorders and neuropsychological aspects of PCOS and on the relevant pathogenetic aspects of cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, we have discussed how to target treatment choices based according to the phenotype and individual patient's needs. Finally, we have suggested potential areas of translational and clinical research for the future with specific emphasis on hormonal and metabolic aspects of PCOS."

The most important route is the lateral drainage via the obturator to the internal and external iliac and common iliac area. The risk for common iliac lymph node metastases is increased in patients with positive pelvic or paraaortic lymph nodes. Positive common iliac lymph nodes are associated with a poorer prognosis than positive pelvic lymph nodes excluding common iliac group.

CD011126,0,18062866,0,Do uterine fibroids affect IVF outcomes?,"The effect of myomectomy on implantation and pregnancy rates prior to assisted reproduction treatments is controversial. This study was designed to assess clinical outcomes of IVF cycles in women with uterine fibroids. A retrospective single-centre assessment of clinical outcomes of IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatments in infertile women in a 4-year span was carried out. All patients underwent detailed transvaginal ultrasound and hysteroscopy to precisely identify presence, location and intracavitary growth of uterine fibroids. Cumulative pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy and live birth rates were considered primary outcome measurements. Fifty-one women with fibroids (97 treatment cycles), 63 patients with previous myomectomy (127 cycles), and 106 infertile women who did not demonstrate fibroids anywhere in the uterus (215 cycles) were considered for the analysis. No significant difference was found for pregnancy and live birth rates between groups. Women with fibroids>4 cm required an increased number of cycles to obtain an ongoing pregnancy, compared with the other groups. The data do not support pre-IVF myomectomy in women with small-to-moderate uterine fibroids, regardless of their location. This represents valuable information in the counselling of women with fibroids before reproductive assisted cycles."
CD011126,0,23599829,0,A rare case of fetal spondylocostal dysostosis - prenatal diagnosis and perinatal care in a patient with multiple large leiomyomas.,"The spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD) is one of the two major clinico-radiological subtypes of the Jarcho-Levin syndrome (JLS). The JLS is a rare heterogeneous entity characterized by facial dysmorphism, short-neck, short-trunk, normal sizes limbs, with multiple vertebral anomalies at all levels of the vertebral column and costal defects. The JLS has been classified into 2 major clinical phenotypes, based on the extent and distribution of skeletal anomalies, the pattern of inheritance and the prognosis. We report the case of a non-consanguineous 35-year-old female patient, with a history of multiple large leiomyomas gravida 1, para 1. A three-dimensional ultrasound at 18 weeks of gestation revealed: thoracic and lumbar hemivertebrae with abnormal alignment of the vertebral bodies and kypho-scoliosis, also the absence of two right ribs and abnormal shaped ribs. The biometric measurement was appropriate for gestational age and no other malformations were found. Although there was no previous history, based on the three-dimensional ultrasound findings a mild subtype of JLS was suspected. At term, the patient gave birth, by Cesarean section, to a male fetus, with a weight of 2700g, a length of 50cm and a calculated Apgar score of 9. The postpartum examination of the fetus confirmed the diagnose of SCD. The evolution of the newborn was good - he had no respiratory difficulty; he will benefit from an experimental surgery involving expandable titanium ribs. Our case illustrates the importance of an accurate ultrasound examination, which can be hindered by multiple large leyomiomas, in order to diagnose and to differentiate the two subtypes of JLS. The SCD can have a favorable evolution with the appropriate perinatal and postpartum care."

CD011126,0,15344474,0,A new & robust information theoretic measure and its application to image alignment.,"In this paper we develop a novel measure of information in a random variable based on its cumulative distribution that we dub cumulative residual entropy (CRE). This measure parallels the well known Shannon entropy but has the following advantages: (1) it is more general than the Shannon Entropy as its definition is valid in the discrete and continuous domains, (2) it possess more general mathematical properties and (3) it can be easily computed from sample data and these computations asymptotically converge to the true values. Based on CRE, we define the cross-CRE (CCRE) between two random variables, and apply it to solve the image alignment problem for parameterized (3D rigid and affine) transformations. The key strengths of the CCRE over using the mutual information (based on Shannon's entropy) are that the former has significantly larger tolerance to noise and a much larger convergence range over the field of parameterized transformations. We demonstrate these strengths via experiments on synthesized and real image data."

CD011126,0,24862444,0,Noninvasive assessment of mitochondrial organization in three-dimensional tissues reveals changes associated with cancer development.,"Mitochondrial organization is often altered to accommodate cellular bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands. Changes in metabolism are a hallmark of a number of diseases, including cancer; however, the interdependence between mitochondrial metabolic function and organization is not well understood. Here, we present a noninvasive, automated and quantitative method to assess mitochondrial organization in three-dimensional (3D) tissues using exclusively endogenous two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and show that mitochondrial organization reflects alterations in metabolic activities. Specifically, we examine the organization of mitochondria within live, engineered epithelial tissue equivalents that mimic normal and precancerous human squamous epithelial tissues. We identify unique patterns of mitochondrial organization in the different tissue models we examine, and we attribute these to differences in the metabolic profiles of these tissues. We find that mitochondria are clustered in tissues with high levels of glycolysis and are more highly networked in tissues where oxidative phosphorylation is more dominant. The most highly networked organization is observed within cells with high levels of glutamine consumption. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mitochondrial organization provides complementary information to traditional morphological hallmarks of cancer development, including variations in nuclear size. Finally, we present evidence that this automated quantitative analysis of endogenous TPEF images can identify differences in the mitochondrial organization of freshly excised normal and pre-cancerous human cervical tissue specimens. Thus, this method could be a promising new modality to assess the role of mitochondrial organization in the metabolic activity of 3D tissues and could be further developed to serve as an early cancer clinical diagnostic biomarker."
CD011126,0,17727123,0,Unsuspected endometrial pathology in the subfertile woman.,"Routine sampling of the endometrium is not considered necessary in the investigation of female infertility in the presence of normal menstruation. We present the cases of five women diagnosed with endometrial pathology during the course of fertility investigations. Three women had atypical polypoid adenomyoma, one had complex endometrial hyperplasia and one had stage 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma. Only the latter described any abnormality in menstruation. No woman had polycystic ovarian syndrome nor any other reason in her history to suspect endometrial pathology. Two women had abnormal transvaginal ultrasound findings. Atypical polypoid adenomyoma is frequently associated with subfertility. Although usually biologically benign, malignant transformation has been reported. With current trends of increasing obesity and later age at attempted conception, the possibility of discovering endometrial pathology during fertility investigation is likely to increase. We believe that a thorough menstrual history and careful assessment of the endometrium is warranted in all women with fertility problems. A transvaginal pelvic ultrasound should be performed in the follicular (early) phase of the cycle. If this ultrasound examination and the woman's menstrual history are both normal, no further evaluation of the endometrial cavity is routinely required. Sonohysterography is superior to pelvic ultrasound in detecting intracavitary pathology and is thus recommended prior to IVF treatment. Hysteroscopy is the gold standard in the detection of intrauterine pathology and is well tolerated in the office setting. Where abnormality is suspected or detected at screening, futher investigation and concomitant treatment is essential. This is ideally performed via hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling or excision of focally abnormal areas."

The patient underwent all requisite examinations and was referred to the malignant diseases panel for an examination and a decision on further treatment. As the patient wished to preserve fertility, the authors decided to continue performing regular controls at intervals of two to three months. The first subsequent control called for a TVUS examination or one using another imaging method, with a multiple endometrial biopsy with curettage of the endocervix.

CD011126,0,23845949,0,Endoluminal surface registration for CT colonography using haustral fold matching.,"Computed Tomographic (CT) colonography is a technique used for the detection of bowel cancer or potentially precancerous polyps. The procedure is performed routinely with the patient both prone and supine to differentiate fixed colonic pathology from mobile faecal residue. Matching corresponding locations is difficult and time consuming for radiologists due to colonic deformations that occur during patient repositioning. We propose a novel method to establish correspondence between the two acquisitions automatically. The problem is first simplified by detecting haustral folds using a graph cut method applied to a curvature-based metric applied to a surface mesh generated from segmentation of the colonic lumen. A virtual camera is used to create a set of images that provide a metric for matching pairs of folds between the prone and supine acquisitions. Image patches are generated at the fold positions using depth map renderings of the endoluminal surface and optimised by performing a virtual camera registration over a restricted set of degrees of freedom. The intensity difference between image pairs, along with additional neighbourhood information to enforce geometric constraints over a 2D parameterisation of the 3D space, are used as unary and pair-wise costs respectively, and included in a Markov Random Field (MRF) model to estimate the maximum a posteriori fold labelling assignment. The method achieved fold matching accuracy of 96.0% and 96.1% in patient cases with and without local colonic collapse. Moreover, it improved upon an existing surface-based registration algorithm by providing an initialisation. The set of landmark correspondences is used to non-rigidly transform a 2D source image derived from a conformal mapping process on the 3D endoluminal surface mesh. This achieves full surface correspondence between prone and supine views and can be further refined with an intensity based registration showing a statistically significant improvement (p<0.001), and decreasing mean error from 11.9 mm to 6.0 mm measured at 1743 reference points from 17 CTC datasets."
CD011126,0,14755986,0,[Minimal invasive treatment of the adnexal surgical pathology].,"Laparoscopic approach has become the ""golden standard"" in managing a wide range of adnexial sufferings. Most laparoscopic cases allow patients to recover quickly. Conventional ultrasonography appears to be useful in the preoperative selection for this surgery. Conventional pulsed Doppler and colour Doppler sonography proved their importance in the diagnosis of malignancy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the advantages and the limits of the minimal invasive approach in managing surgical adnexial sufferings. A retrospective study was carried on 75 operative laparoscopy cases performed between 1998-2002. Surgical procedures were performed mainly for ovarian cysts (69 cases, 92%), but there were also treated other types of adnexial pathology such as: hydrosalpinx (2), piosalpinx (1), tubal cysts (2), ectopic pregnancy (7), pelvic adherences (7) and one case of hydatid tubal cyst. Types of surgery performed were cystectomy (36), ooforectomy (11), salpingo-ooforectomy (10), fenestration (10), salpingectomy (6), lysis of adhesions (7). The mean operation time ranged between 50 and 80 minutes and the mean postoperative stay was of 3.65 days."

It is a prerequisite for all CAD systems to extract the air-distended colon segments from 3D abdomen computed tomography scans. In this paper, we present a two-level statistical approach of first separating colon segments from small intestine, stomach and other extra-colonic parts by classification on a new geometric feature set; then evaluating the overall performance confidence using distance and geometry statistics over patients. The proposed method is fully automatic and validated using both the classification results in the first level and its numerical impacts on false positive reduction of extra-colonic findings in a CAD system. It shows superior performance than the state-of-art knowledge or anatomy based colon segmentation algorithms."

We presented a case of FTS involving the common tendon sheath surrounding the flexor tendons leading to the third metacarpal. A 63-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of a painless mass in his right palm that had recently tripled in size. Examination demonstrated a 5x4 cm firm, nodular, superficial mass that was adherent to the overlying skin. Radiographs of the hand revealed a soft tissue mass without bony abnormality. Ultrasound demonstrated a solid, heterogeneous and hypoechoic mass and computed tomography demonstrated that the mass centered predominantly at the mid and distal portions of the third metacarpal. The patient underwent excisional biopsy of the lesion and a palmar, longitudinal incision was made from the wrist to the third metacarpal. Submitted histologic sections revealed a well-circumscribed lesion closely resembling hyalinized collagen. Neither vascular proliferations, necrosis, nor mitoses were observed. Similarly, multinucleated giant cells, pigment-laden macrophages, and inflammatory cells were also not identified. A diagnosis of FTS was rendered. We provided an additional rare case to the literature of a FTS and highlight the need to consider this entity in the differential diagnosis for any soft tissue lesion in the hand.

CD011126,0,15063511,0,"A sensitive new indicator for diagnostics of ovarian malignancy, based on the Doppler velocity spectrum.","Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecological malignancy, with an overall survival rate of about 35%. Approximately 60% of the cases of ovarian cancer are lethal. Ultrasonic examination, including Doppler imaging, is a commonly used technique for the diagnosis of ovarian masses. Two major clinical parameters, currently derived from the Doppler flow waveform, are the resistance index (RI) and the pulsatility index (PI). The decay constant of the Doppler waveform, which characterizes its decrease from systole to diastole as an exponential decay, has recently been presented as an additional measure of tumor malignancy. In this paper, we have analyzed the velocity spectrum of the Doppler flow signal to determine if it reveals differences that might contribute to the diagnosis of malignancy. We designed a new parameter characterizing the slope of the mean velocity spectrum at end-diastole (""End Diastolic Velocity Distribution Slope,"" referred to as DVD_S). Additional indices, related to various approaches for the analysis of the Doppler image, were also derived. However, they proved to be inferior to the DVD_S. The DVD_S was tested on 20 benign and 33 malignant ovarian images. This new parameter seems to provide a good ability to discriminate between the two types of tumor. Its mean value is 1.90 +/- 1.33 for malignant tumors, compared to 9.21 +/- 5.34 for benign masses (area under ROC curve: 0.983), yielding a detection rate of about 94%. In fact, this parameter provides much better results than the previously used variables, and has the potential to significantly improve the detection of malignancy."

Four anatomical salient points on the colon are distinguished first. Then correlation optimized warping (COW) method is applied to the segments defined by the anatomical landmarks to find better global registration based on local correlation of segments. To utilize more features along the colon centerline, we extended the COW method by embedding canonical correlation analysis into it for correlation calculation of colon segments. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we tested the algorithm on a CTC dataset of 19 patients with 23 polyps. Experimental results show that by using our method, the estimation error of polyp location could be reduced 68.5% (from 41.6mm to 13.1mm on average) compared to a traditional dynamic warping algorithm."
CD011126,0,19222487,0,Testicular dysgenesis syndrome: foetal origin of adult reproductive problems.,"The evidence for the existence of testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) is presented in this review. Several epidemiological studies have shown that conditions like cryptorchidism, impaired spermatogenesis, hypospadias and testicular cancer can be associated as risk factors for each other. Thus, the risk of testis cancer is significantly increased in men with cryptorchidism and/or infertility. Several recent studies point towards early dysgenesis of the foetal testis as the biological link between these disorders. Dysgenesis has been demonstrated in biopsies of the contralateral testis of men with testis cancer and in infertile men. The histological evidence includes immature seminiferous tubules with undifferentiated Sertoli cells, microliths and Sertoli-cell only tubules. Dysgenetic testes often have an irregular ultrasound pattern, where microliths may also be visible. Our current hypothesis is that maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals may contribute to the pathogenesis of TDS. Animal experiments have shown that all TDS symptoms, except testicular cancer, can be induced by foetal exposure to anti-androgenic chemicals. However, the cause of TDS in humans remains to be determined."

Moreover, the VMAT technique was compared with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and fixed-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), in terms of target coverage and organs at risk sparing. The number of monitor units and the delivery time were analyzed to score the treatment efficiency. All plans were verified in a dedicated solid water phantom using a 2D array of ionization chambers. Twelve patients with endometrial carcinoma who underwent radical hystero-adenexectomy and fixed-field IMRT treatments were retrospectively included in this analysis; for each patient, plans were compared in terms of dose-volume histograms, homogeneity index, and conformity indexes. All techniques met the prescription goal for planning target volume coverage, with VMAT showing the highest level of conformity at all dose levels. VMAT resulted in significant reduction of rectal and bladder volumes irradiated at all dose levels compared with 3D-CRT. No significant differences were found with respect to IMRT. Moreover, a significant improvement of the dose conformity was reached by VMAT technique not only at the 95% dose level (0.74 vs. 0.67 and 0.62) but also at 50% and 75% levels of dose prescription. In addition, VMAT plans showed a significant reduction of monitor units by nearly 28% with respect to IMRT, and reduced treatment time from 11 to <3 minutes for a single 6-Gy fraction. In conclusion, VMAT plans can be planned and carried out with high quality and efficiency for the irradiation of vaginal vault alone, providing similar or better sparing of organs at risk to fixed-field IMRT and resulting in the most efficient treatment option. VMAT is currently our standard approach for radiotherapy of low-risk endometrial cancer."

CD011126,0,21084936,0,ACR appropriateness criteria© ovarian cancer screening.,"The majority of women with ovarian cancer have advanced stage disease at the time of diagnosis and a poor 5 year survival rate. Hence, screening has been investigated in the hopes of improving survival by diagnosing ovarian cancer at an earlier stage. Most screening methods thus far have included ultrasound and/or serum tumor markers. However, low prevalence of the disease, high false positive rate of current screening methods, and the probable rapid growth of most ovarian carcinomas from no defined precursor lesion, all contribute to difficulty in screening for ovarian cancer. While screening may be able to detect ovarian cancer at an earlier stage, adequate data is presently lacking on whether screening improves survival. The results of ongoing large clinical trials will be available in a few years and should provide critical information regarding the usefulness of screening. Pending results of those large clinical trials, screening is not currently recommended for women at average risk for ovarian cancer. Screening is most likely to be performed in women with an increased familial risk of ovarian cancer, but patients should be aware that even with this risk factor, there is currently insufficient evidence to know if screening is effective. New screening methods, including new or multiple serum markers and proteomics, are also being investigated."

In the proposed method, sub-images (SIs) transformed from the picked-up elemental images of a three-dimensional (3-D) object, are sequentially rearranged with a spiral scanning topology. The moving vectors among the SIs, then, are estimated and compensated with the block-matching algorithm. Furthermore, spatial redundancy among the SIs is also removed by computing the differences between the local SIs and their motion-compensated versions, from which a sequence of MCRIs are finally generated and compressed with the MPEG-4 algorithm. Experimental results show that the compression efficiency of the proposed method has been improved up to 861.1% on average from that of the JPEG-based elemental images (EIs) method, and up to 1,497.0% and 118.8% on average from those of the MPEG-based MCSIs and the MPEG-based RIs method, respectively."

CD011126,0,25065725,0,A study of a three-dimensional PLGA sponge containing natural polymers co-cultured with endothelial and mesenchymal stem cells as a tissue engineering scaffold.,"The interaction between vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in a complex hemodynamic and mechanical environment plays an important role in the control of blood vessel growth and function. Despite the importance of VSMCs, substitutes are needed for vascular therapies. A potential VSMC substitute is human adult bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). In this study, the effect of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds containing three natural polymers (demineralized bone particles, silk, and small intestine submucosa) on the phenotype of MSCs and SMCs cultured with or without ECs was investigated. The study objective was to create a media equivalent for a tissue engineered blood vessel using PLGA, natural polymers, and MSCs co-cultured with ECs. The PLGA containing the natural polymers silk and SIS showed increased proliferation and cell adhesion. The presence of silk and DBP promoted a MSC phenotype change into a SMC-like phenotype at the mRNA level; however these differences at the protein level were not seen. Additionally, PLGA containing SIS did not induce SMC gene or protein upregulation. Finally, the effect of ECs in combination with the natural polymers was tested. When co-cultured with ECs, the mRNA of SMC specific markers in MSCs and SMCs were increased when compared to SMCs or MSCs alone. However, MSCs, when co-cultured with ECs on PLGA containing silk, exhibited significantly increased α-SMA and calponin expression when compared to PLGA only scaffolds. These results indicate that the natural polymer silk in combination with the co-culture of endothelial cells was most effective at increasing cell viability and inducing a SMC-like phenotype at the mRNA and protein level in MSCs."

Image distortion was compared between the band view and four other three-dimensional review modes using ten 10-mm and ten 20-mm electronically generated polyps. Diagnostic performance and interpretation time were compared between the band view and the conventional endoluminal view by two independent readers in 52 patients who underwent CTC and colonoscopy on the same day. Mean image distortion index values, in which 1 indicates no distortion and the larger value represents greater distortion, were significantly smaller with the band view (1.03 and 1.01 for 10-mm and 20-mm polyps, respectively) than with the filet view (1.65 and 1.55) or the virtual colon dissection (3.27 and 3.85) (P < or = 0.004). The sensitivity and specificity for detecting adenomatous polyps > or = 6 mm did not differ, but the mean interpretation time was significantly shorter with the band view than with the conventional endoluminal view by 1.8 and 4.5 minutes in readers 1 and 2, respectively (P < 0.0001).

CD011126,0,21876751,0,Killing hypoxic cell populations in a 3D tumor model with EtNBS-PDT.,"An outstanding problem in cancer therapy is the battle against treatment-resistant disease. This is especially true for ovarian cancer, where the majority of patients eventually succumb to treatment-resistant metastatic carcinomatosis. Limited perfusion and diffusion, acidosis, and hypoxia play major roles in the development of resistance to the majority of front-line therapeutic regimens. To overcome these limitations and eliminate otherwise spared cancer cells, we utilized the cationic photosensitizer EtNBS to treat hypoxic regions deep inside in vitro 3D models of metastatic ovarian cancer. Unlike standard regimens that fail to penetrate beyond ∼150 µm, EtNBS was found to not only penetrate throughout the entirety of large (>200 µm) avascular nodules, but also concentrate into the nodules' acidic and hypoxic cores. Photodynamic therapy with EtNBS was observed to be highly effective against these hypoxic regions even at low therapeutic doses, and was capable of destroying both normoxic and hypoxic regions at higher treatment levels. Imaging studies utilizing multiphoton and confocal microscopies, as well as time-lapse optical coherence tomography (TL-OCT), revealed an inside-out pattern of cell death, with apoptosis being the primary mechanism of cell killing. Critically, EtNBS-based photodynamic therapy was found to be effective against the model tumor nodules even under severe hypoxia. The inherent ability of EtNBS photodynamic therapy to impart cytotoxicity across a wide range of tumoral oxygenation levels indicates its potential to eliminate treatment-resistant cell populations."

All female patients aged fifty or under, who presented to the Emergency Department with right iliac fossa pain over an eighteen-month period, and who went on to have a diagnostic laparoscopy performed, were included in the study. Ultrasound and operative findings were recorded. 147 patients fulfilling the study criteria were identified. 38 (26%) had pre-operative ultrasound performed. 15 of these had normal findings, 10 had gynaecological pathology identified, 8 had non-specific findings. Of the 38 patients who had pelvic ultrasound pre-operatively, 26 (68%) had acute appendicitis at laparoscopy, only 5 of whom had a sonographic diagnosis of acute appendicitis made pre-operatively. We conclude that while positive ultrasound findings in cases of acute appendicitis are helpful, negative studies do not exclude the diagnosis. Patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis should proceed directly to laparoscopy while patients in whom the diagnosis is less certain, should be admitted for a period of observation facilitating repeated clinical evaluation.

CD011126,0,17729205,0,"[Severe foetal growth retardation in a patient with uterus bicornis, velamentous insertion and partial placental abruption in the 26th week of gestation--a case report].","Foetal growth retardation (IUGR) occurs in approximately 3-10 % of all pregnancies and may result from foetal, maternal or placenta-related conditions. In IUGR, the placental weight is often reduced and the placental capacity, reflected by the organ's weight, is impaired. Uterine malformations have an incidence of 3-4 % and may be the cause of placental abruptions occurring in 0.4-1.3 % of all pregnancies. We report on a patient in the 26 (th) week of pregnancy who was admitted with vaginal bleeding. A uterus bicornis had been found previously. Sonography showed severe foetal growth retardation and a pathological foetal Doppler signal. A haematoma located cranial of the os uteri was sonographically diagnosed, and a partial placental abruption was suspected. Due to a pathological cardiotocography, a primary Caesarean section was performed. Intraoperative evaluation confirmed the presence of a uterus bicornis. In addition, the placenta showed an insertio velamentosa. The growth retarded foetus - 490 g birth weight - was anaemic. Respiratory therapy and surfactant substitution were performed because of a respiratory distress syndrome. At a corrected age of 8 weeks the boy was sent home without neurological sequelae. In the case reported, a malformation of the uterus was the cause of a pathologically altered placenta. The multiple factors responsible for the described severe intrauterine growth retardation were a low placental weight and thus a reduced placental capacity, an impaired foetal circulation caused by the velamentous insertion, as well as a partial placental abruption. In normotensive pregnancies with IUGR, macroscopic and histopathological examinations of the placenta are therefore strongly recommended. Prior to getting pregnant, the therapeutic options should be explained to women with uterine malformations."
CD011126,0,8150367,0,Histopathological aspects of pelviscopic hysterectomy. Investigation of histological giant sections and morphometry to confirm a new application of minimally invasive surgery.,The present study attempts to confirm the effectiveness of a new method of pelviscopic hysterectomy which maintains the pelvic floor integrity comparable to that in a supracervical uterus amputation. A major advantage of this procedure is that the central portion of the cervix and transformation zone is punched out using a special resection tool for the purpose of removing any potential source of cancer. Thirty-four specimens resected by pelviscopic hysterectomy were investigated using histological giant and serial sections. Morphometrical analysis was performed using MOP-AMO2 (Kontron Instruments). The transitional zone and cervical glands were excised completely with an average security distance of 1.5 cm to the resection margins. No mesonephric remnants were found which might serve as a possible source of adenocarcinoma. Our study confirms that the application of this new technique of pelviscopic hysterectomy is not limited by the development of stump carcinoma while also possessing the additional advantage of maintaining pelvic floor integrity.
CD011126,0,25585555,0,[Ultrasound staging of endometrial cancer - recommended methodology of examination].,The extent of the staging surgery in cases of histologically proven endometrial cancer depends on whether the tumor is of high risk or low risk for extrauterine spread and recurrence. There are several significant prognostic factors - histological subtype and grade of dediferentiation from preoperative biopsy and local stage of uterine involvement based on imaging methods. The depth of myometrial invasion and presence of cervical stromal infiltration (local staging) can be assessed by ultrasound with the overall accuracy comparable to that of magnetic resonance. Transvaginal ultrasound enables to vizualize detailed pelvic anatomy and that is why it is considered to be a suitable tool for assessment of local stage of endometrial cancer. It is advisable to use the standardized terminology defined by International Endometrial Tumor Analysis group (IETA) to describe ultrasound findings. The standardized methodology of ultrasound preoperative staging examination based on prearranged protocols is recommended.
CD011126,0,25585554,0,[Endometrial cancer - preoperative identification of low and high risk endometrial cancer (a review of the most recent ultrasound studies)].,"Despite the high resolution of ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging and modern bioptic approaches, diagnostic error of preoperative staging is around 20%. The preoperative staging is focused to differentiate low risk (< 50% myometrial invasion, histological grade 1 and 2, endometrioid cancer, no cervical invasion) or high risk endometrial cancer (all others). Preoperative biopsy tends to underestimate the tumour histotype and grading in 20% of cases. Therefore, the sonomorphological and Doppler pattern have been identified that can preoperatively alert us to the presence of low or high risk endometrial cancer. With discrepancy between preoperative ultrasound tumour characteristics and results of endometrial biopsy a supplementary intraoperative frozen section of uterus is recommended. Ultrasound examination performed by an experienced sonographer is accurate in most cases but tends to overestimate myometrial invasion and underestimate cervical stromal invasion. Based on the identification of factors that significantly affected the accuracy of ultrasound, it was recommended to restrict evaluation to sonomorphological tumour parameters within the preoperative tumour staging. This is in response to the tendency of ultrasound experts with knowledge of the clinical data of patients, and prognostic parameters of the disease who have encountered adverse tumour characteristics through ultrasound (e.g. inhomogeneous, hypo- or isoechogenous tumor with high tumour perfusion) to 'intuitively overestimate the stage of the disease and conversely. The attempts to restrict the assessment of tumour invasion to those parameters that are easily and objectively evaluated has not so far proved effective. A promising objective parameter seems to be the minimum distance between the tumour and uterine serosa. When this parameter was included in the new objective model, the high-risk endometrial cancer was predicted with an accuracy similar to subjective assessment of tumour invasion by an expert. The preoperative work-up for high-risk endometrial cancer prediction was designed and externally validated in order to triage the patients for adequate staging surgery. This approach was based on the combination of the results of preoperative endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound and reached the similar accuracy as a more complicated approach using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging and hysteroscopic-directed biopsies. Both approaches can identify eight of 10 women with high-risk of lymph node metastases and spare eight of 10 low-risk women extended surgery."
CD011126,0,25585556,0,[Recommended guidelines of diagnosis for women with an ovarian cyst or tumour].,"Transvaginal ultrasonography is the first-line and best imaging technique for characterising adnexal masses preoperatively. The optimal approach is the subjective assessment of ultrasound images by experts. An alternative evidence-based approach to the pre-surgical diagnosis of adnexal tumours is to use simple ultrasound rules or logistic regression model LR2 developed by the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group. Their test performance matches subjective assessment by experienced examiners and should be adopted as the principal test to characterize masses as benign or malignant. Measurements of serum CA 125 are not necessary for characterization of ovarian pathology in premenopausal women and are unlikely to improve the performance of experienced ultrasound examiners, even in the postmenopausal group. However, in postmenopausal patients, serum CA 125 may play a role as a second-stage test, especially in centers with less-experienced ultrasound examiners."
CD011126,0,25585551,0,[The optimal imaging in gynecological oncology].,"In this review we discuss in detail the advantages and the limitations of the modern imaging techniques to assess the tumour spread in pelvis, abdomen and extraabdominally in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent gynecological cancer. Transvaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging yield similar levels of accuracy when utilised for the diagnosis of gynecological cancer and the detection of pelvic spread. Ultrasound is, however, a commonly available, non-invasive, and inexpensive imaging method that can be carried out without any risk or discomfort to the patient. Although increasing evidence shows that transabdominal ultrasound is an accurate technique for the detection of intra- and retroperitoneal tumour spread, it requires experience, adequate equipment and suitable acoustic conditions. Contrast-enhanced computed abdominopelvic tomography remains the most commonly used preoperative imaging modality to assess abdominal cavity and retroperitoneum for extrapelvic tumour spread. Alternatively magnetic resonance imaging can be used in cases of contra-indication of computed tomography. If there is suspicion of extraabdominal tumour spread, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of thorax or positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography is used. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography detects more distant metastases than computed tomography alone. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography is, therefore, the optimal imaging technique for suspected recurrence, particularly if there is suspicion of recurrence but conventional imaging methods have yilded negative results or if salvage surgery is planned."

According to current data, ultrasound is comparably accurate with magnetic resonance imaging in view of tumour presence and local extent assessment. Ultrasound, if compared with the magnetic resonance imaging, does not have known contraindications and it is a broadly available diagnostic test. Currently no advanced imaging technique exists that can reliably detect infiltrated lymph nodes in the clinically early stage of the disease, as it often manifests as micrometastatic involvement in non-enlarged lymph nodes. The sensitivity of lymph node detection using ultrasound in the early stage is around 40%, but the specificity is high (96%).

CD011126,0,19495739,0,Spatial allelic imbalance of BCL2 genes and chromosome 18 territories in nonneoplastic and neoplastic cervical squamous epithelium.,Several studies suggest a correlation between genome architecture and gene function. To elucidate mechanisms of gene positioning during cell differentiation and malignant transformation we investigated the nuclear positions of the BCL2 alleles and chromosome 18 territories in different layers of nonneoplastic cervical squamous epithelium and cervical squamous carcinomas in relation to gene expression. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and three-dimensional (3D) image analysis using tissue sections revealed that one BCL2 allele was located more peripherally than the other one in nuclei of the basal layer of nonneoplastic epithelium. During terminal cell differentiation the outer BCL2 allele showed a shift towards the nuclear center. In BCL2-expressing carcinomas the inner BCL2 allele was located more peripherally compared with the basal layer of nonneoplastic epithelium. Our results suggest a functional relevance of unequal allelic BCL2 gene positioning and support the hypothesis that transcriptional BCL2 activation is associated with BCL2 relocation towards the nuclear periphery.

Three different MR contrast agents were used for coating PPF scaffolds. Initially, iron oxide (IONP) or manganese oxide nanoparticles (MONP) carrying the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin were absorbed or mixed with the scaffold and their release into solution at physiological conditions was measured with MRI and optical imaging. A slow (hours to days) and functional release of the drug molecules into the surrounding solution was observed. In order to examine the release properties of proteins and polypeptides, protamine sulfate, a chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MR contrast agent, was attached to the scaffold. Protamine sulfate showed a steady release rate for the first 24h. Due to its biocompatibility, versatile drug-loading capability and constant release rate, the porous PPF scaffold has potential in various biomedical applications, including MR-guided implantation of drug-dispensing materials, development of drug carrying vehicles, and drug delivery for tumor treatment."

CD011126,0,22572686,0,Ultrasound of colon diverticulitis.,"Overall, the diagnosis of diverticulitis is more reliably made by computed tomography (CT) than by ultrasound (US). However, since US is often used as a first modality in acute abdomen, it is important to be aware of the US signs of diverticulitis. Besides, in not too obese patients, US may be superior to CT. US is most useful in early, uncomplicated diverticulitis. Daily, repeated US examinations in patients with diverticulitis have taught that diverticulitis, in the majority of cases, runs a predictable and benign course. Initially, there is local wall thickening of the colon with preservation of the US layer structure. Within the inflamed diverticulum, a fecolith is present, and the diverticulum is surrounded by hyperechoic, noncompressible tissue, which represents the inflamed mesentery and omentum 'sealing off' the imminent perforation. US follow-up shows evacuation of the fecolith to the colonic lumen, with or without the transient development of a small paracolic abscess, sometimes with disintegration of the fecolith. This process of spontaneous evacuation of pus and fecolith via local weakening of the colonic wall at the level of the original diverticular neck towards the colonic lumen takes place within 1 or 2 days, rarely longer. The residual inflammatory changes remain present for several days after the evacuation, and it is not uncommon to find an empty diverticulum at first presentation. If, in such cases, patients are specifically asked for their symptoms, they invariably declare that 'the worst pain is over'. Whenever diverticulitis takes a complicated course, CT is superior to US, especially in the detection of free air, fecal peritonitis and deeply located abscesses, and in general in obese patients. Finally, US, if necessary followed by CT, has an important role in the diagnosis of alternative conditions: ureterolithiasis, pyelonephritis, perforated peptic ulcer, appendicitis, Crohn's disease, epiploic appendagitis, gynecological conditions, colonic malignancy, pancreatitis, etc. Right-sided colonic diverticulitis in many respects differs from its left-sided cousin. Diverticula of the right colon are usually congenital, solitary, true diverticula containing all bowel wall layers. The fecoliths within these diverticula are larger and the diverticular neck is wider. There is no hypertrophy of the muscularis of the right colonic wall. My observations with US and CT in 110 patients with right colonic diverticulitis clearly show that it invariably has a favorable course and never leads to free perforation or large abscesses. Although relatively rare (left:right = 15:1), it is crucial to make a correct diagnosis since the clinical symptoms of acute right lower quadrant pain may lead to an unnecessary appendectomy or even right hemicolectomy."
CD011126,0,19737275,0,Predictors of improved seminal parameters and fertility after varicocele repair in young adults.,"The aim of our study was to determine hormonal or biochemical markers in patients with clinically palpable left varicocele but without a history of infertility, with especial emphasis on nitric oxide, related with improved seminal parameters after varicocelectomy. Semen samples were obtained from 202 patients with left varicocele grade II or III. Nitric oxide levels in seminal plasma were determined by the Griess technique. Testicular volume was determined ultrasonographically in both testes and hormonal profile was measured. The post-operative sperm concentration increased significantly in patients with normal sperm count or moderate oligozoospermia, but we did not find an increment in sperm count in patients with mild and severe oligozoospermia after surgery. The mean percentage of normal motility significantly increased after surgery, but we did not observe a significant increment in morphologically normal sperm count and testicular volume after varicocele repair. Moreover, we did not find any correlation between nitric oxide concentrations and severity of oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia or abnormal sperm morphology in this population. It is concluded that in the general male population, varicocele repair is not associated with an improved semen profile in all cases. We did not observe a significant correlation between nitric oxide concentrations and semen profile."
CD011126,0,25565080,0,Adnexal mass in the postmenopausal patient.,"The adnexal mass in a postmenopausal patient poses an important diagnostic and management dilemma for primary care providers and gynecologists. Postmenopausal women are at a significantly increased risk of gynecologic malignancy; yet even in this population the majority of adnexal masses are benign. Evaluation and management of these lesions centers on the identification of malignancy, especially ovarian cancer, while avoiding unnecessary intervention in patients with benign lesions. Tumor markers and imaging can help in the evaluation of adnexal mass in postmenopausal women. Transvaginal ultrasound has long been considered the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of adnexal masses. Particularly in the setting of high frequency utilization of transvaginal probes, which project high quality images allowing for detailed descriptions of the macroscopic appearance of the mass, and remains the least expensive of all imaging modalities currently available. For adnexal masses that are highly suspicious for cancer, women should be referred a gynecologic oncologist and facility for optimal care."

Eight patients who had undergone two or more consecutive unsuccessful IVF cycles (group I), in which at least one good quality embryo was transferred, and 18 patients with at least three spontaneous late miscarriages (group II) were included in the study. Endometrial and follicular development were evaluated by ultrasonography. Plasma concentrations were evaluated for FSH and prolactin on cycle day 3 and for progesterone on day 7 after ovulation, when an endometrial biopsy was performed; samples were cryopreserved for interleukin-1 receptor type I immunohistochemistry and embedded in paraffin for endometrial dating. Patients with no ovulation or any anomalies in hormone concentrations, uterine cavity or endometrial histology were excluded. Interleukin-1 receptor type I was expressed in the lumenal epithelium of both groups. There was a significant difference (P = 0.0357, two-tailed Fisher's exact test) in the glandular epithelium expression of interleukin-1 receptor type I between groups I (87.5% of patients) and II (38.9% of patients). Endometrial expression of interleukin-1 receptor type I does not seem to be involved in embryo implantation in IVF patients, but may play a role in spontaneous recurrent miscarriage."

GAS is proposed to include minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) as a very well-differentiated form and has been suggested to arise from lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH). We report the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of a GAS associated with LEGH. On MRI, the LEGH component was detected as multiple cystic lesions arranged in a ""cosmos pattern"", while the GAS was depicted as a predominantly solid lesion containing obvious adenocarcinoma and MDA components, which appeared as mass-like and infiltrative components, respectively. The GAS exhibited tiny cysts on three-dimensional T2-weighted images, high intensity on diffusion-weighted images mostly due to T2 shine-through effect according to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, and reticular enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, which reflected numerous dilated glandular structures of the tumor. Low ADC was only observed at the deepest invasion front of the obvious adenocarcinoma component. Our case suggests that the MRI features of GAS vary depending on the tumor's histological components, and it is important to be aware of these imaging features when evaluating LEGH on MRI."

CD011126,0,14968039,0,[Three-dimensional ultrasonographic uterine vascularization and embryo implantation].,"During the last decade transvaginal color Doppler has played an important role in increasing the understanding of early human development. Although our knowledge of early pregnancy development has recently improved, little is known about the most critical period of human development: implantation. Recent advances in three-dimensional ultrasound have made studies of follicular development, ovulation and uterine receptivity more accurate. Three-dimensional ultrasound facilitates determination of the antral follicle number, ovarian volume calculation and analysis of the intensity of ovarian stromal blood flow in a short time without increasing the patient's discomfort. It is also possible to determine predictors of IVF outcome by three-dimensional ultrasound. Favorable ovarian stromal vascularity is associated with higher number of retrieved oocytes and increased pregnancy rates. The high degree of endometrial perfusion shown by color Doppler ultrasonography and on three-dimensional power Doppler histograms on the day of embryo transfer can indicate a more favorable endometrial milieu for successful in vitro fertilization. Uterine septum is the most common uterine abnormality occurring in infertile women.

CD011126,0,20705214,0,Brain morphological changes associated with cyclic menstrual pain.,"Primary dysmenorrhea (PDM) is the most prevalent gynecological disorder for women in the reproductive age. PDM patients suffer from lower abdominal pain that starts with the onset of the menstrual flow. Prolonged nociceptive input to the central nervous system can induce functional and structural alterations throughout the nervous system. In PDM, a chronic viscero-nociceptive drive of cyclic nature, indications of central sensitization and altered brain metabolism suggest a substantial central reorganization. Previously, we hypothesized that disinhibition of orbitofrontal networks could be responsible for increased pain and negative affect in PDM. Here, we further tested this hypothesis. We used an optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach to compare total and regional gray matter (GM) increases and decreases in 32 PDM patients with 32 healthy age and menstrual cycle matched (peri-ovulatory phase) controls. Abnormal decreases were found in regions involved in pain transmission, higher level sensory processing, and affected regulation while increases were found in regions involved in pain modulation and in regulation of endocrine function. Moreover, GM changes in regions involved in top-down pain modulation and in generation of negative affect were related to the severity of the experienced PDM pain. Our results demonstrate that abnormal GM volume changes are present in PDM patients even in the absence of pain. These changes may underpin a combination of impaired pain inhibition, increased pain facilitation and increased affect. Our findings highlight that longer lasting central changes may occur not only in sustained chronic pain conditions but also in cyclic occurring pain conditions."

We studied 500 women undergoing the first IVF cycle who had embryo(s) cryopreserved. The main outcome measures were live-birth in the first FET cycle and cumulative live-birth in all the FETs combined after the same stimulation cycle. Our results showed that baseline AFC and AMH level on the day before ovarian stimulation showed significant correlation. In the first FET cycle, AFC and AMH level were significantly higher in subjects attaining live-birth in the first FET cycle or cumulative live-birth from all FETs than those who did not. Both AMH and AFC were insignificant predictors of live-birth in the first FET cycle or cumulative live-birth after adjusting for age. The areas under the ROC curves for AMH, AFC and age were 0.654, 0.625 and 0.628, respectively, for predicting cumulative live-birth. In conclusion, we reported for the first time that baseline AFC and AMH in the index stimulation cycle have only modest predictive performance on cumulative live-birth in subsequent FET cycles."

CD011126,0,15942155,0,Successful conservative treatment of a cesarean scar pregnancy with uterine artery embolization.,"Ectopic pregnancy developing in a previous Cesarean section scar is rare and is associated with catastrophic complications, such as uterine rupture and uncontrollable bleeding, which may lead to loss of the uterus. The operative treatments that have been reported for cesarean scar pregnancy are dilatation and curettage and excision of trophoblastic tissues using either laparotomy or laparoscopy. Recently, conservative treatment of scar pregnancy with locally and/or systemically administered methotrexate (MTX) has been reported. However, recent reports demonstrated that cases treated with MTX sometimes required laparotomy later because of excessive bleeding. In this series of cases we have demonstrated that viable cesarean scar pregnancies can be treated safely by selective transarterial embolization in combination with subsequent dilatation and curettage and local or systemic injections of MTX. In these three cases, uterine artery embolization proved to be a useful procedure for preventing uncontrollable bleeding and unnecessary uterine loss."

Fifteen outpatient women were seen for a gynecologic examination and 24 women were seen with rectosigmoid endometriosis. Transvaginal ultrasonography was performed independently by two observers with a focus on the presence and size of rectosigmoid endometriosis. The senior observer had several years of experience, whereas the junior observer was a medical student with no prior experience in transvaginal ultrasonography. The findings of the two observers were identical concerning the identification of rectosigmoid endometriosis. The probability of differences in size within 30% of the mean was 0.81, 0.63 and 0.61 for length, width and depth, respectively.

CD011126,0,22906340,0,Surgical management of neurovascular bundle in uterine fibroid pseudocapsule.,"The uterine fibroid pseudocapsule is a fibro-neurovascular structure surrounding a leiomyoma, separating it from normal peripheral myometrium. The fibroid pseudocapsule is composed of a neurovascular network rich in neurofibers similar to the neurovascular bundle surrounding a prostate. The nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy has several intriguing parallels to myomectomy. It may serve either as a useful model in modern fibroid surgical removal, or it may accelerate our understanding of the role of the fibrovascular bundle and neurotransmitters in the healing and restoration of reproductive potential after intracapsular myomectomy. Surgical innovations, such as laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy applied to the intracapsular technique with magnification of the fibroid pseudocapsule surrounding a leiomyoma, originated from the radical prostatectomy method that highlighted a careful dissection of the neurovascular bundle to preserve sexual functioning after prostatectomy. Gentle uterine leiomyoma detachment from the pseudocapsule neurovascular bundle has allowed a reduction in uterine bleeding and uterine musculature trauma with sparing of the pseudocapsule neuropeptide fibers. This technique has had a favorable impact on functionality in reproduction and has improved fertility outcomes. Further research should determine the role of the myoma pseudocapsule neurovascular bundle in the formation, growth, and pathophysiological consequences of fibroids, including pain, infertility, and reproductive outcomes."

CD011126,0,21160193,0,Ultrasound for ovarian cancer screening: are we throwing the baby out with the bath water?,"The lack of standardization in gynaecological scanning is worrying, especially with regard to the sonographic evaluation of adnexal masses. The results of ongoing trials on the use of ultrasound as a screening test for ovarian cancer are likely to be affected by this lack of standardization in terminology and classifications. The lack of high-quality gynaecological ultrasound, combined with the low prevalence of ovarian cancer, may yield to a poor performance of transvaginal ultrasound as a screening test for ovarian cancer in large trials. In order to increase the specificity of ultrasound in a screening program, thus reducing unnecessary surgeries, a uniform, reproducible and accurate method for the sonographic evaluation of ovarian masses must be implemented. This move to improve and standardize reporting in gynaecological ultrasound should negate the need to use the phrase 'complex ovarian mass'. In this paper, we will critically evaluate current terminology, newly proposed accepted morphological classification of ovarian cysts as well as the ability for ultrasound to discriminate between benign and malignant ovarian masses."

Pelvic MRI showed a T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense, nonenhancing mass in the right ovary and a homogeneously T1 hyperintense lesion with mixed T2 signal in the left ovary. Fat-saturated T1-weighted sequences showed the left ovarian lesion to be an endometrioma containing a high concentration of hemoglobin breakdown products and revealed other endometriotic implants in the right ovary, broad ligament, and cul-de-sac. Follow-up pelvic sonography 9 weeks later showed resolution of the right complex cystic ovarian mass, indicating that it was a physiologic hemorrhagic cyst."
CD011126,0,23094764,0,[The rational preoperative diagnosis of ovarian tumors - imaging techniques and tumor biomarkers (review)].,"The majority of patients who suffer from an early-stage or advanced-stage of ovarian cancer complain about symptoms, mainly gastrointestinal ones. The pelvic examination in ovarian cancer detection is limited by the adnexal position in the pelvis and frequent extraovarian spread of disease. Recently, any reliable tumor biomarker (CA 125 and/or HE4), which can be used in differential diagnosis between benign and malignant ovarian tumors, does not exist. According the results of the largest multicenter International Ovarian Trial Analysis (IOTA), ultrasound if performed by an experienced sonologist is an ideal diagnostic method in differential diagnosis between benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The experienced examiner is also able to detect extraovarian tumor spread and to assess tumor operability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used only to complement ultrasound in cases when high tissue resolution is needed. Computed tomography (CT) is a useful method for detection of extraovarian spread, especially in cases when an ultrasound examiner experienced in abdominal scanning is not available. Similarly, fusion of positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) is a highly accurate method for the detection of abdominal and extraabdominal tumor spread, but its use is limited by cost and the low availability of this method. On the other hand, PET/CT is not recommended for primary ovarian cancer detection because of its lower sensitivity in comparison to ultrasound and its high false positive rates as well."

The laparoscopic approach may also treat various gastric tumors without opening the gastric cavity. Robotic surgery was developed in response to the limitations and drawbacks of laparoscopic surgery. Herein, we describe a case of robotic-assisted laparoscopic wedge resection of a gastric leiomyoma. A 63-year-old male complaining of abdominal pain was found to have an incidental 3 cm antral mass on an abdominal CT. Endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) confirmed a submucosal mass. Biopsy of the lesion was consistent with a leiomyoma. The DaVinci robotic system was used for partial gastrectomy and reconstruction, with the addition of intraoperative ultrasound to localize the lesion intraoperatively. Pathological examination of the resected mass confirmed a diagnosis of leiomyoma with negative margins. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patient was discharged home on the second postoperative day. Intraoperative endoscopic ultrasound is a safe technique that may improve the success rate of surgery by confirming the location of the lesion. Robotic assistance in gastric resection offers an easy minimally invasive approach to such tumors. This approach can achieve adequate surgical margins and lead to short hospital stays."

CD011126,0,24160788,0,Polyp on ultrasound: now what? The association between gallbladder polyps and cancer.,"The association between gallbladder polyps (GBP) and gallbladder cancer (GBC) is unclear. We sought to determine the association between preoperative diagnosis of GBP on imaging and GBC. A retrospective review of patients over 9 years was conducted using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes for GBP and GBC who underwent cholecystectomy at our institution. Demographics, imaging findings, and pathology results were recorded. A total of 2416 patients underwent cholecystectomy during the study period. Twenty-seven had an operation for GBP either as a result of concern for size or symptoms. Polyp sizes were categorized as less than 1 cm, 1 to 2 cm, or 2 cm or greater. Twenty-four patients in this group (88.9%) had no evidence of high-grade dysplasia or cancer and all of these benign polyps were 2 cm or less on imaging. One patient with a 2.4-cm polyp had high-grade dysplasia, and two patients with polyps over 3 cm had adenocarcinoma. During the same period, 20 patients had an operation for GBC with two patients common to the polyp group. The group of patients with noncancerous polyps was significantly younger than the cancer group (polyps and no polyps). The cancer group was more likely to be symptomatic. Therefore, polyps over 2 cm should be removed given the risk of high-grade dysplasia and cancer above this size. Polyps less than 2 cm were not associated with high-grade dysplasia or cancer and thus surgery may not be required. Intermediate- and small-sized polyps can be monitored with serial ultrasound, especially in younger, asymptomatic patients in whom the risk of malignancy is low."

The development of endovaginal ultrasound, which allows early diagnosis, and methotrexate chemotherapy have opened up new therapeutic options. A 45-year-old multigravida presented at 8 weeks' gestation with vaginal bleeding. Endovaginal ultrasound demonstrated a cervical pregnancy with a fetal pole, 1.2 x 1.4 cm sac, no cardiac pulsations, and an empty uterus. After discussion with the patient, single low dose methotrexate 1.5 mg/m2 was given intramuscularly. The patient's hCG titre was 5882 IU-(Third International Standard). Over a 5-week period the hCG titres fell, and the gestational sac disappeared. The patient experienced intermittent vaginal bleeding and cramping but was managed as an outpatient. Single low dose methotrexate may be a successful management option in selected cases of cervical pregnancy."

CD011126,0,19997952,0,Acute ovarian torsion in an infant: diagnostic clues on supine and decubitus abdominal radiographs confirmed by ultrasound.,Acute ovarian torsion is an uncommon yet important diagnostic consideration in any female pediatric patient presenting with acute abdominal pain. A 2-month-old infant presented to the emergency department with a several-day history of constipation. Evaluation with plain radiographs demonstrated a subtle yet persistent soft tissue mass in the right pelvis. Follow-up ultrasound revealed characteristic findings for ovarian torsion and subsequent salpingo-oophorectomy was performed confirming the diagnosis. Acute ovarian torsion is an uncommon and frequently overlooked diagnosis in female infants presenting with gastrointestinal or urinary tract symptoms. Careful assessment of plain radiographic findings may aid in the further management of this difficult diagnosis in female infants. Ultrasound is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a ruptured sinus of Valsalva with severe aortic valve regurgitation which originated from the right coronary sinus entering the outlet portion of the left ventricular outflow tract. Operation revealed the aortic entrance of the tunnel was above the right coronary sinus. Direct closure of the orifice of the tunnel using three stitches of 4-0 polypropylene with felt and aortic valve replacement (AVR) was performed.

This can be associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) due to APC gene mutations. In this study, we investigated the difference in the biological characteristics between FAP-associated and sporadic CMV. Between 1991 and 2010, 32 patients with CMV were treated in Kuma Hospital. Thirty-one of these underwent initial surgery for CMV in Kuma Hospital. Twelve patients were FAP-associated and the remaining 19 were sporadic CMV. All patients were female. Tumors of FAP-associated CMV were more frequently multiple than those of sporadic CMV. Patient age and tumor size did not differ between the two groups. Of 12 FAP-associated CMV, 5 were detected by thyroid nodule (thyroid precedent group) and 7 were detected by FAP (polyposis precedent group) as an initial manifestation. Patient age was younger and tumor size was smaller in the polyposis group than in the thyroid nodule group. All patients lacked extrathyroid extension on intraoperative finding and were node-negative on pathological examination. To date, two patients with FAP-associated CMV who initially underwent hemithyroidectomy (one in Kuma Hospital and one in another hospital) showed recurrence to the remnant thyroid during follow-up. None of the patients showed recurrence to other regions or died of carcinoma. Taken together, CMV is considered an indolent disease in our series. FAP-associated CMV showed multiple tumors more frequently than sporadic CMV. Total thyroidectomy is recommended for FAP-associated CMV, but extensive lymph node dissection is not necessary."

CD011126,0,18391328,0,Visualization of biomechanical properties of female pelvic floor function using video motion tracking of ultrasound imaging.,"Real time ultrasound imaging is one of the many ways to clinically evaluate the anatomical and functional condition of female pelvic floor in patients with urinary incontinence. Reflex arc testing of the displacement of uro-gynecological structures during imaging provides a non-invasive way of visualizing their motility. The response from such tests invariably contains a very large amount of visual information, which is not readily captured and assimilated by the observer because it occurs so fast. For this reason only a portion of available information is retained, typically the beginning end ending frame of the image is preserved. Using video motion tracking, parameters were identified to define important biomechanical and temporal relationships. We conclude that new and clinically significant amount of original information about the female pelvic floor can be obtained through the proposed analysis of visualizations."

Presentation with bilateral ovarian masses and ovarian hyperstimulation has been described in fertile years. Gonadotroph adenomas are extremely infrequent in children. We report a 13-year-old postmenarcheal girl referred to our hospital with 6 months of amenorrhea, abdominal palpable mass presumptive of bilateral ovarian tumors. The patient had Tanner IV breast development and a large abdominal mass occupying the whole low hemiabdomen. Laboratory evaluation revealed high estradiol levels with suppressed luteinizing hormone and inappropriately high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Pelvic ultrasound showed enlarged ovaries containing multiple giant cysts. An MRI revealed a pituitary macroadenoma. Transsphenoidal resection of the adenoma was performed with an uneventful postoperative course. Immunohistologic examination only showed staining for FSH, thus confirming pituitary secreting FSH adenoma. Hormonal laboratory levels normalized and ovarian masses showed marked involution 1 month after surgery. Three months later the MRI showed tumor disappearance."

CD011126,0,23962242,0,MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer from a Nordic perspective.,"The first Nordic protocol for three-dimensional (3D) planned radiotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer was the prospective NOCECA study (1994-2000). NOCECA consisted of computed tomography (CT)-based 3D conformal external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to the primary tumour combined with brachytherapy (BT) based on x-ray imaging. In NOCECA the planning aim was to achieve 80 Gy at point A from EBRT and BT combined. However, the balance of dose between EBRT and BT was determined by tumour size at diagnosis with more EBRT dose given to point A and less by BT in more advanced stages. In 2005 image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optimisation of the BT dose distribution to the remaining tumour and cervix at time of BT (HR CTV) was introduced in Aarhus. EBRT remained like in NOCECA until 2008 when the SIB to the primary tumour was abandoned and IMRT was introduced as routine technique. In this study, we report outcome of our first five-year experience with IGABT using our NOCECA cohort as reference."
CD011126,0,19064224,0,Hydrometrocolpos--diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas.,"Congenital distal vaginal obstruction is a rare condition, usually asymptomatic until menarche, thus often diagnosed only during puberty. Hydrometrocolpos is caused by such an obstruction, only when reasonable amounts of fluid are secreted from the mucosal lining of the genital tract. This presentation may be symptomatic and already diagnosed early in life, even during the perinatal period. There are various causes of congenital vaginal obstruction, and according to their etiology, surgical procedures may be either simple or more complicated. Timing of the surgical procedure for opening the obstruction is a dilemma. We suggest postponing the definite procedure to the menarche, when hematocolpos (accumulation of blood in the vagina) will develop, but before the further development of hematometra (accumulation of blood in the uterine cavity). This will cause stretching of the obstructed segment, will enable correct diagnosis, facilitate the procedure, and eventually minimize the complications. However, if the vaginal obstruction in neonates or in childhood is symptomatic, as in the described case, aspiration of the fluid and temporary release of the symptoms should be the optimal choice, followed by a final surgical correction latter in life."

CD011126,0,23292675,0,Ultrasound-guided reoperative hysteroscopy: managing endometrial ablation failures.,"Endometrial ablation and hysteroscopic myomectomy and polypectomy are having an increasing impact on the care of women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). The complications of these procedures include the late onset of recurrent vaginal bleeding, cyclic lower abdominal pain, hematometra and the inability to adequately sample the endometrium in women with postmenopausal bleeding. According to the 2007 ACOG Practice Bulletin, approximately 24% of women treated with endometrial ablation will undergo hysterectomy within 4 years. By employing careful cervical dilation, a wide variety of gynecologic resectoscopes, and continuous sonographic guidance it is possible to explore the entire uterine cavity in order to locate areas of sequestered endometrium, adenomyosis, and occult hematometra. Sonographically guided reoperative hysteroscopy offers a minimally invasive technique to avoid hysterectomy in over 60% to 88% of women who experience endometrial ablation failures. The procedure is adaptable to an office-based setting and offers a very low incidence of operative complications and morbidity. In addition, the technique provides a histologic specimen, which is essential in adequately evaluating the endometrium in postmenopausal women or women at high risk for the development of adenocarcinoma of the endometrium."
CD011126,0,16545618,0,Transvaginal ultrasound for diagnosis of adenomyosis: a review.,"The objective of this chapter is to relate the image findings of transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) to structural changes of adenomyosis; in order to clarify the present clinical diagnostic approach in the diagnosis of adenomyosis, the performance of TVS is evaluated in comparison to other diagnostic modalities. A Medline search of papers in English on the use of TVS and needle biopsy for the diagnosis of adenomyosis was carried out. It was found that TVS is highly observer-dependent, but in the hands of experienced investigators it has an adequate diagnostic accuracy in clinically suspected cases. The diagnostic accuracy of TVS is at an intermediate level but is in line with that of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in unselected patients without myomas undergoing surgery. TVS is a sufficiently accurate tool for diagnosis of adenomyosis in clinically suspected cases, but not in unselected premenopausal women with myomas. Resectoscopic hysteroscopic biopsy has not been sufficiently evaluated but could be a useful diagnostic tool, whereas needle biopsy is not. In conclusion, in clinically suspected adenomyosis cases TVS should be favoured as the primary diagnostic tool. Substantial experience and specific training is required for TVS to be a useful diagnostic tool in adenomyosis. MRI may be considered when TVS is inconclusive. Clinicians should above all be observant of image findings of adenomyosis in patients with no wish to preserve fertility."

CD011126,0,19904036,0,"Contour propagation in MRI-guided radiotherapy treatment of cervical cancer: the accuracy of rigid, non-rigid and semi-automatic registrations.","External beam radiation treatment for patients with cervical cancer is hindered by the relatively large motion of the target volume. A hybrid MRI-accelerator system makes it possible to acquire online MR images during treatment in order to correct for motion and deformation. To fully benefit from such a system, online delineation of the target volumes is necessary. The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy of rigid, non-rigid and semi-automatic registrations of MR images for interfractional contour propagation in patients with cervical cancer. Registration using mutual information was performed on both bony anatomy and soft tissue. A B-spline transform was used for the non-rigid method. Semi-automatic registration was implemented with a point set registration algorithm on a small set of manual landmarks. Online registration was simulated by application of each method to four weekly MRI scans for each of 33 cervical cancer patients. Evaluation was performed by distance analysis with respect to manual delineations. The results show that soft-tissue registration significantly (P < 0.001) improves the accuracy of contour propagation compared to registration based on bony anatomy. A combination of user-assisted and non-rigid registration provides the best results with a median error of 3.2 mm (1.4-9.9 mm) compared to 5.9 mm (1.7-19.7 mm) with bone registration (P < 0.001) and 3.4 mm (1.3-19.1 mm) with non-rigid registration (P = 0.01). In a clinical setting, the benefit may be further increased when outliers can be removed by visual inspection of the online images. We conclude that for external beam radiation treatment of cervical cancer, online MRI imaging will allow target localization based on soft tissue visualization, which provides a significantly higher accuracy than localization based on bony anatomy. The use of limited user input to guide the registration increases overall accuracy. Additional non-rigid registration further reduces the propagation error and negates errors caused by small observer variations."

However, imaging PCO is not an easy procedure and it requires a thorough technical and medical background. The two-dimensional (2-D) ultrasonography (U/S) remains the standard for imaging PCO and the current consensus definition of PCO determined at the joint ASRM/ESHRE consensus meeting on PCOS rests on this technique: either 12 or more follicles measuring 2 to 9mm in diameter and/or increased ovarian volume (>10cm(3)).

CD011126,0,18001457,0,Three-dimensional ultrasonographic diagnosis and hysteroscopic management of a viable cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy.,"Implantation of conception material within a cesarean section scar is an extremely rare form of ectopic pregnancy with devastating complications, such as uterine rupture and intractable bleeding. Both 2-D and 3-D transvaginal ultrasonographic devices are used adequately for precise diagnosis, but there is still a lack of consensus concerning management strategies. No therapeutic modality is suggested to be entirely efficacious and safe for preserving uterine integrity. We present here a 29-year-old woman with vaginal bleeding and a gestational sac with a viable embryo of 6 weeks of age that was implanted in a cesarean section scar. Serum beta-hCG levels were 16 792 mIU/mL. Following an unsuccessful treatment course of systemic methotrexate, the patient underwent operative hysteroscopy. Minimally invasive hysteroscopic resection of the ectopic gestational mass without major complication appears to be an alternative therapeutic approach with minimal morbidity and preservation of future fertility."

A total of 101 consecutive infertility patients referred to hospital for investigations were studied by Doppler ultrasound. Couples with male infertility were excluded. The control group comprised 19 healthy women having regular menstrual cycle and no history of infertility. The pulsatility index (PI) in o.a. and u.a. was measured in pre- and post-ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle. The PI values of the controls were compared with those of the patients with various infertility etiologies. The PI values of the infertility patients who subsequently delivered were compared with those of the patients failing to deliver. Infertility patients had high PI in o.a. and u.a. in the luteal phase more often than controls. High vascular resistance in u.a. and o.a. in the luteal phase reduce the take-baby-home rate.

CD011126,0,18046071,0,Fetal goiter and bilateral ovarian cysts.,"A unique case of fetal goiter accompanied by bilateral ovarian cysts in a mother treated with methimazole for Graves'disease is reported. The abnormal findings were detected by ultrasound at 31 weeks of gestation. Umbilical fetal blood sampling revealed elevated serum TSH, normal concentrations of free T 4 , normal FSH and LH and high concentrations of E 2 . A series of weekly amniocenteses and intra-amniotic injections of levothyroxine was initiated, along with a reduction of the mother's methimazole dosage. The level of TSH in amniotic fluid was initially high, but was considerably reduced by each injection and followed by a gradual reduction of fetal goiter as well as the left ovarian cyst. The right cyst ruptured spontaneously. At 36 weeks + 4 days, the patient underwent elective caesarean section and gave birth to a female, weighing 2,880 g with 1- and 5-min Apgar scores of 10. The thyroid gland appeared normal in size, and cord blood TSH and free T 4 were both within normal limits. At ultrasound control 6 days later, the right ovarian cyst was not visible, while the left cyst was still present. Thus, our report supports previous findings that fetal goiter can be treated successfully with intra-amniotic injection of levothyroxine.More importantly, it shows that fetal hypothyroidism with elevated levels of TSH can be accompanied by ovarian cysts,suggesting interference between thyreotropic and gonadotropic hormones."

Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging can assist in pre-operative diagnosis. A 60 year old post-menopausal woman presented with a mass per abdomen. Ultrasound revealed fibroid uterus with lipomatous areas. The hysterectomy specimen showed a pure intramural lipoma of the uterus. As clinical symptoms and signs of uterine lipoma are indistinguishable from uterine leiomyoma, various imaging techniques can aid in pre-operative diagnosis. The diagnosis of pure lipoma of the uterus should only be made when any smooth muscle if present is confined to the periphery of the tumor."
CD011126,0,21071280,0,The pitfalls of BladderScan™ PVR in evaluating bladder volume in adolescent females.,"Post-void residual (PVR) determination is an integral part of the evaluation of children presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms. Historically the PVR volume has been obtained by urinary catheterization after the child has voided, however, with the advent of ultrasound technology, PVR was determined in a noninvasive fashion by radiology personnel. Currently, PVR determinations may be obtained by healthcare personnel (without specialized training) using a portable, self calculating ultrasound; the BladderScan. While BladderScan PVR has been shown to be accurate and reproducible, it cannot differentiate between a distended bladder and other cystic pelvic structures. Several case reports have been published illustrating falsely elevated PVRs by bladder scan in adults with cystic pelvic structures. We present two adolescent females with LUTS who had falsely elevated PVRs by bladder scan, who, subsequently, underwent formal imaging to identify ovarian cystic pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first report of falsely elevated bladder scan PVR in children related to cystic pelvic organ pathology."

CD011126,0,17419039,0,Fibromatosis: benign by name but not necessarily by nature.,"Aggressive fibromatoses, also known as desmoid tumours, are rare fibrous tissue proliferations with a tendency for slow, local infiltrative growth. There is an association with Gardner's syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. Histologically they are fairly bland with no abnormal mitoses or necrosis. They do not metastasize, but can cause significant morbidity through their locally destructive effects. Magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice for diagnosis, pre-treatment planning and post-treatment follow-up. Surgical excision with a wide margin is the treatment of choice. However, there is a tendency for local recurrence and repeated excision may result in a poor functional or cosmetic outcome. Radiotherapy is used to reduce local recurrence rates after excision and is also used to treat inoperable tumours. Long-lasting remissions can be obtained. Treatment is now planned using modern three-dimensional conformal techniques, similar to those used in soft tissue sarcoma management. There is no definite dose-response relationship, but doses of 50-60 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions are recommended. Systemic therapy has been used for lesions not controlled by surgery or radiotherapy, or less commonly, as a primary treatment. Tamoxifen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used most often as they are relatively non-toxic, but there is limited experience with cytotoxic chemotherapy and biological agents. There are no randomised trials to help guide the management of this locally aggressive 'benign' tumour and treatment decisions are best made by the local soft tissue sarcoma multidisciplinary team."

Pregnant women after adenomyomectomy sometimes suffer some adverse events, among which uterine rupture has been widely acknowledged. We describe a post-abortive woman who had uterine artery pseudoaneurysm occupying the entire uterine cavity. She underwent adenomyomectomy and became pregnant. She experienced a missed abortion and underwent evacuation and curettage, which caused bleeding. Several days later, ultrasound revealed an intrauterine mass with marked blood flow. Angiography revealed the un-ruptured left uterine artery pseudoaneurysm, with arterial embolization stopping the flow within the pseudoaneurysm. Adenomyomectomy with subsequent curettage was considered to have caused the pseudoaneurysm. We must be cautious that pseudoaneurysm may occur in post-abortive women after adenomyomectomy."

Technical modalities have evolved during the last decades: stepping source technology, imaging modalities development, specially IMN, treatment planning system integrating 3D images. Images from CT-Scan and MRI have contributed to a better knowledge of tumoral extension and critical organs. CT and/or MRI compatible applicators allow a sectional image based approach with a better definition of tumour volume compared to traditional approaches. The introduction of 3D image based approach for GTV and CTV requires new definitions and a common language. In 2000, a working group within GEC-ESTRO was created to support 3D image based 3D treatment planning approach in cervix cancer BT. The task was to determine a common terminology enabling various groups to use a common language. Recommendations were described and proposed based on clinical experience and dosimetric concepts of different institutions. Two CTVs were described en relation to the risk for recurrence: high-risk CTV and intermediate risk CTV. In order to better define the role of such definitions and their potential impact on the complication incidence in patients with cervical cancer, a special French programme was developed. The aim of this programme is to study the incidence of the severe 2-year complication rate in two comparable patient populations: one population is treated using PDR brachytherapy with CT-Scan or MRI with the applicators in place allowing a 3D dosimetry with optimization, the second population is treated using standard X-rays radiographs without any delineation of the target nor optimisation. Each population arm includes 425 patients. A medicoeconomic assessment is performed, allowing a real cost of the most sophisticated approach compared to a historical dosimetric system."

Seventy-two patients received a low-fibre diet with oral iodine before CT-colonography. Six novices and two experienced observers reviewed both cleansed and uncleansed examinations in randomized order. Mean per-polyp sensitivity was compared between the methods by using generalized estimating equations. Mean per-patient sensitivity, and specificity were compared using the McNemar test. Results were stratified for experience (experienced observers versus novice observers). Mean per-polyp sensitivity for polyps 6 mm or larger was significantly higher for novices using cleansed 3D (65%; 95%CI 57-73%) compared with uncleansed 2D (51%; 95%CI 44-59%).

Twenty CTC datasets were reviewed at standard 90-degree and ""wide"" 140-degree viewing angles using customised viewing software (V3D colon; Viatronix), which listed number and size of missed mucosal areas (""missed regions tool"") and percentage mucosal visualisation. We compared: (1) unidirectional and bidirectional flythrough using 140- versus 90-degree viewing angles; (2) reader analysis time comparing unidirectional 140-degree flythrough versus bidirectional 90-degree flythrough; (3) paired image snapshots of 12 polyps taken at each field of view were reviewed to assess conspicuity. All patients underwent conventional colonoscopy. Bidirectional 140-degree review reduced the numbers of missed areas by between eight- and 40-fold depending on size category, including those >1,000 mm(2), compared with standard 90-degree bidirectional flythrough (P < 0.001). Combined prone-supine unidirectional 140-degree flythrough and missed area review was 3.8 min faster than 90-degree bidirectional review (9.3 versus 5.5 min, P < 0.0001) for the same surface visualisation. When viewed as pairs, polyps were rated more conspicuous with a 90-degree field of view, P = 0.03. Wide-angle (140-degree) CTC can reduce both numbers of missed areas and review times.

Approximately 100 cases of splenosis have been reported but only a minority of them have been published in the gynecological literature. Our case indicates that those involved in pelvic scanning (even of asymptomatic women) and/or treating those complaining of lower abdominal pain or presenting with pelvic tumors should be aware of splenosis as a possible diagnosis."

CD011126,0,15953871,0,Selected adnexal cystic masses in postmenopausal women can be safely managed by laparoscopy.,"The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic treatment for adnexal cystic masses that were predicted to be benign in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women found to have an adnexal cystic mass were retrospectively evaluated with transvaginal ultrasonography, and serum CA-125 levels. The selection criteria were adnexal cystic masses greater than 3 cm but less than 10 cm, the masses were in the benign range (4-8) of Sassone's scoring system for transvaginal ultrasonography, and the patients had serum CA-125 levels less than 65 IU/mL. Two hundred nineteen women fulfilled the criteria and underwent operative laparoscopy. Almost all the masses (99.5%) were accurately predicted to be benign except for one borderline ovarian tumor. Two hundreds thirteen (97.3%) women were successfully managed by operative laparoscopy and six (2.7%) required laparotomy. For the patients managed by laparoscopy, the mean operative time was 51.3 min; the mean hospital stay was 2.5 days. There was no significant morbidity and surgery-related mortality. The combination of the Sassone's scoring system for transvaginal ultrasonography and serum CA-125 level can accurately predict benign cystic masses, and operative laparoscopy is technically feasible and safe for the management of adnexal mass in postmenopausal women."

A 27-year-old pregnant woman with this disease underwent laparotomy and oophorectomy to remove a multilocular ovarian tumor at 14 weeks of pregnancy. This proved to be a mucinous cystadenoma. Toward the third trimester, she presented with marked elevations of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and plasma renin activity.

This case illustrates endocrinological parameters during pregnancy in a woman with classical salt-wasting CAH."
CD011126,0,19484142,0,Inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha confers precancerous phenotype in an organoid model of normal human ovarian surface epithelial cells.,"In this study, we established an in vitro organoid model of normal human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells. The spheroids of these normal HOSE cells resembled epithelial inclusion cysts in human ovarian cortex, which are the cells of origin of ovarian epithelial tumor. Because there are strong correlations between chronic inflammation and the incidence of ovarian cancer, we used the organoid model to test whether protumor inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha would induce malignant phenotype in normal HOSE cells. Prolonged treatment of tumor necrosis factor alpha induced phenotypic changes of the HOSE spheroids, which exhibited the characteristics of precancerous lesions of ovarian epithelial tumors, including reinitiation of cell proliferation, structural disorganization, epithelial stratification, loss of epithelial polarity, degradation of basement membrane, cell invasion, and overexpression of ovarian cancer markers. The result of this study provides not only an evidence supporting the link between chronic inflammation and ovarian cancer formation but also a relevant and novel in vitro model for studying of early events of ovarian cancer."

If the intrabiliary rupture is the most frequent complication encountered, rupture in the peritoneum is rare, with exact data not available. Between 1993-2002 160 patients with hepatic hydatid cysts were operated. Six of them had an intraperitoneal ruptured cyst. Ultrasound raised the suspicion of hepatic hydatid cyst ruptured in the peritoneum in 4 cases, in one case the intact cyst migrated in the lower abdomen were it was mistaken for an ovarian cyst. After a thorough lavage with hypertonic serum, the parasite was evacuated, the pericyst partially removed and the cavity collapsed with non-absorbable sutures. The postoperative course was uneventful. Prophylaxis with benzimidazolic drugs started days 2-3 PO. At a follow-up between 1-4 years no peritoneal hydatidosis was detected.

In this case, a young female presented with cyclic pelvic pain that continued after previous surgical resection of an ovarian cyst. Further investigation with clinical examinations and multimodality imaging demonstrated ipsilateral renal agenesis and a Class III Mullerian duct anomaly (MDA) requiring a second operative procedure. It is believed that this case is a variant of the described obstructed hemi-vagina with ipsilateral renal agenesis (OVIRA) anomaly as pathologically there was ipsilateral renal agenesis and complete vaginal agenesis in our case. It is imperative to have a high clinical suspicion of mullerian duct abnormalities when encountering a patient with other urogenital anomalies. This will decrease the amount of misdiagnoses, guide appropriate surgical intervention, and decrease the risk of future reproductive complications."

In our hospital, the procedure is performed routinely for cases with suspected gross lesions. We performed 3D CT enteroclysis for three cases with enteroenteric intussusception bowel. The lesions associated with intussusception were identified, single-incision laparoscopic surgery was performed, and diagnoses of lipoma and Peutz-Jeghers polyp were made in two cases. 3D CT enteroclysis did not reveal any associated lesion in the third case. This was followed by an intraoperative exploration during gastrectomy for stomach cancer, but no intestinal lesion was found.

In the majority of cases, in the initial phase, symptoms are nonspecific for neoplastic disease, which is a sig-nificant factor delaying the final diagnosis. At the moment of diagnosis, most tumors are so large in size that removing the whole mass carries a risk related to the extent of surgery and maintaining the stability of pelvic girdle and sacro-lumbar junction. In this publication we present a case of a 38-year-old female patient with primary sacral tumor (S2-S4) undergoing surgical treatment at the Spinal Surgery, Oncological Orthopedics and Traumatology Clinic at Poznan University of Medical Sciences. The patient was referred to an orthopedic outpatient clinic following gynecological surgery for removal of a suspected tumor of the uterus confirmed in an ultrasound examination. In a control magnetic resonance examination (MRI) there was a pathological mass visualized within the sacral bone infiltrating the presacral region and compressing the distal part of the colon. The patient underwent subtotal sacrectomy from a posterior approach. In order to reconstruct the posterior pelvic wall, biological material Permacol™ was used. There was a transient anal sphincter atony and urinary bladder paresis as well as sensory disturbances in S3-S5 dermatomes after the surgery. Several days after surgery, the patient was diagnosed with a deep cutaneous fistula and a significant volume of fluid in the postoperative cavity (in control CT). VAC treatment was implemented following a few days of passive drainage and significant improvement as well as secondary closing of the fistula were observed within a short period of time."

However, considering the heterogeneously vascular distribution inside the uterine fibroids especially with hyper vascularity, it is not easy to choose the correct therapy acoustic power for every part inside fibroids. In our study, we presented two cases of fibroids with hyper vascularity, to show the differences between them with different outcomes. Selecting higher therapy acoustic powers to ablate high-perfused areas efficiently inside fibroids might help achieving good ablation results. Volume transfer constant (K(trans)) maps from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging at baseline helps visualizing perfusion state inside the fibroids and locating areas with higher-perfusion. In addition, with the help of K(trans) maps, appropriate therapy acoustic power could be selected by the result of initial test and therapy sonications at different areas with significantly different perfusion state inside fibroids."

She had hundreds of adenomas inside the entire colon and a congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium (CHRPE). The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and a central compartment neck node dissection. Gross examination of the thyroid identified two solid and cystic lesions.

The patient's brother had undergone a total colectomy due to FAP at the age of 25. Genetic analyses of the patient's family members revealed that she and her brother had the same germline mutation, in which five nucleotides (AAAGA) were deleted from codon 1309 of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene exon 15. Strong and frequent immunoreactivities of beta-catenin and p53 were evident in the tumor tissue. At the time of writing, a preventive colectomy was still under consideration for the patient.

This is a systematic review of the range of values for the uterine cavity and the practical implications of these measurements, Following a review of multiple data bases & a QUORUM analysis. Only articles with clearly defined quantitative measurements were included. Mechanical cavity measurements with a variety of instruments gave a mean endometrial cavity length (ECL) of 33.73 mm (18-22.1) and a mean endometrial cavity width (ECW) of 25.1 mm (17.8-32.2) for nulliparae. The values for multiparae were mean ECL 38.6mm(20.61-40.3) and mean ECW 34.9 mm (23.4-53). Imaging measurements for the uterine cavity by hysterography and ultrasound were mean ECL 44.3 mm (29-64) for multiparae and ECL 37 mm for nulliparae. Mean ECW was 28.2 mm (21-33) for nulliparae and 32.1 mm (26-38) for multiparae. There were wide variations due to parity, ethnicity and gestational states.

CD011126,0,19352298,0,"Androgen dependence of hirsutism, acne, and alopecia in women: retrospective analysis of 228 patients investigated for hyperandrogenism.","Hirsutism, acne, alopecia, and oligo-amenorrhea are clinical expressions of hyperandrogenism, one of the most frequent endocrine disorders in women of reproductive age. Women referred to our endocrine clinics for skin symptoms of hyperandrogenism underwent a laboratory workup to evaluate hormone measurements and received antiandrogen therapy. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 228 consecutive patients investigated over 6 years.Patients with hirsutism had higher levels of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and salivary testosterone; lower levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG); and a higher prevalence of oligo-amenorrhea than patients with alopecia, while patients with acne showed intermediate values. Hirsutism score correlated positively with androstenedione, DHEAS, and salivary testosterone, and correlated negatively with SHBG; salivary testosterone showed the highest correlation coefficient. Total testosterone was not significantly different among patients with hirsutism, alopecia, or acne, and did not significantly correlate with hirsutism score. Hirsutism and oligo-amenorrhea were the most sensitive symptoms of hyperandrogenism, and no androgenic parameter alone allowed us to identify all cases of hyperandrogenism.Patients of central European origin sought consultation with milder hirsutism scores than patients of southern European origin. There was, however, no difference in the clinical-biological correlation between these groups, arguing against differences in skin sensitivity to androgens.Polycystic ovary syndrome, defined as hyperandrogenism (hirsutism or elevated androgens) and oligo-amenorrhea, was diagnosed in 63 patients (27.6%), an underestimate compared with other reports that include systematic ovarian ultrasound studies. Neither pelvic ultrasound, used in a limited number of cases, nor the luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio helped to distinguish patients with polycystic ovary syndrome from the other diagnostic groups. These included hyperandrogenism (hirsutism or elevated androgens) and eumenorrhea (101 patients; 44.3%); normal androgens (acne or alopecia and eumenorrhea) (51 patients; 22.4%); isolated low SHBG (7 patients; 3.1%); nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (4 patients; 1.8% of total, 4.9% of patients undergoing cosyntropin stimulation tests); and ovarian tumor (2 patients; 0.9%).Ethinylestradiol and high-dose cyproterone acetate treatment lowered the hirsutism score to 53.5% of baseline at 1 year, and was also effective in treating acne and alopecia. The clinical benefit is ascribed to the peripheral antiandrogenic effect of cyproterone acetate as well as the hormone-suppressive effect of this combination.

CD011126,0,23372646,0,Imaging CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in ovarian cancer therapy.,"Chemokine CXCL12 and receptor CXCR4 have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer, a disease that continues to have a dismal prognosis. CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling drives proliferation, survival, and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, leading to tumor growth and metastasis. Pleiotropic effects of CXCR4 in multiple key steps in ovarian cancer suggest that blocking this pathway will improve outcomes for patients with this disease. To quantify CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in cell-based assays and living mouse models of ovarian cancer, we developed a click beetle red luciferase complementation reporter that detects activation of CXCR4 based on recruitment of the cytosolic adapter protein β-arrestin 2. Both in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell cultures, we established that bioluminescence from this reporter measures CXCL12-dependent activation of CXCR4 and inhibition of this pathway with AMD3100, a clinically-approved small molecule that blocks CXCL12-CXCR4 binding. We used this imaging system to quantify CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in a mouse model of metastatic ovarian cancer and showed that treatment with AMD3100 interrupted this pathway in vivo. Combination therapy with AMD3100 and cisplatin significantly decreased tumor burden in mice, although differences in overall survival were not significantly greater than treatment with either agent as monotherapy. These studies establish a molecular imaging reporter system for analyzing CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in ovarian cancer, which can be used to investigate biology and therapeutic targeting of this pathway in cell-based assays and living mice."

CD011126,0,23608881,0,4D imaging of protein aggregation in live cells.,"One of the key tasks of any living cell is maintaining the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins in the face of ever-changing environmental conditions and an intracellular environment that is tightly packed, sticky, and hazardous to protein stability. The ability to dynamically balance protein production, folding and degradation demands highly-specialized quality control machinery, whose absolute necessity is observed best when it malfunctions. Diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and certain forms of Cystic Fibrosis have a direct link to protein folding quality control components, and therefore future therapeutic development requires a basic understanding of underlying processes. Our experimental challenge is to understand how cells integrate damage signals and mount responses that are tailored to diverse circumstances. The primary reason why protein misfolding represents an existential threat to the cell is the propensity of incorrectly folded proteins to aggregate, thus causing a global perturbation of the crowded and delicate intracellular folding environment. The folding health, or ""proteostasis,"" of the cellular proteome is maintained, even under the duress of aging, stress and oxidative damage, by the coordinated action of different mechanistic units in an elaborate quality control system. A specialized machinery of molecular chaperones can bind non-native polypeptides and promote their folding into the native state, target them for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, or direct them to protective aggregation inclusions. In eukaryotes, the cytosolic aggregation quality control load is partitioned between two compartments: the juxtanuclear quality control compartment (JUNQ) and the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) (Figure 1 - model). Proteins that are ubiquitinated by the protein folding quality control machinery are delivered to the JUNQ, where they are processed for degradation by the proteasome. Misfolded proteins that are not ubiquitinated are diverted to the IPOD, where they are actively aggregated in a protective compartment. Up until this point, the methodological paradigm of live-cell fluorescence microscopy has largely been to label proteins and track their locations in the cell at specific time-points and usually in two dimensions. As new technologies have begun to grant experimenters unprecedented access to the submicron scale in living cells, the dynamic architecture of the cytosol has come into view as a challenging new frontier for experimental characterization. We present a method for rapidly monitoring the 3D spatial distributions of multiple fluorescently labeled proteins in the yeast cytosol over time. 3D timelapse (4D imaging) is not merely a technical challenge; rather, it also facilitates a dramatic shift in the conceptual framework used to analyze cellular structure. We utilize a cytosolic folding sensor protein in live yeast to visualize distinct fates for misfolded proteins in cellular aggregation quality control, using rapid 4D fluorescent imaging. The temperature sensitive mutant of the Ubc9 protein (Ubc9(ts)) is extremely effective both as a sensor of cellular proteostasis, and a physiological model for tracking aggregation quality control. As with most ts proteins, Ubc9(ts) is fully folded and functional at permissive temperatures due to active cellular chaperones. Above 30 ° C, or when the cell faces misfolding stress, Ubc9(ts) misfolds and follows the fate of a native globular protein that has been misfolded due to mutation, heat denaturation, or oxidative damage. By fusing it to GFP or other fluorophores, it can be tracked in 3D as it forms Stress Foci, or is directed to JUNQ or IPOD."

Phase imaging of objects with optical height variation greater than the wavelength of light is ambiguous and causes phase wrapping. By comparing two phase images recorded at different wavelengths, the images can be accurately unwrapped. The unwrapping method is computationally fast and straightforward, and it can process complex topologies. Additionally, the limitations on the total optical height are significantly relaxed.

CD011126,0,14986055,0,Supine/left decubitus scanning: a valuable alternative to supine/prone scanning in CT colonography.,"The purpose was to evaluate supine/left decubitus as an alternative to supine/prone scanning in computed tomographic colonography (CT colonography). Fifty patients were randomised to supine/prone, another 50 to supine/left decubitus scanning. Patients were scanned using a single-slice CT scanner. The colon was divided into eight segments. Comparisons of distension, breathing artefacts, residus and polyp detection were made between the two groups as well as between the different positions. Adequate distension was found in approximately 85, 97 and 95% of segments in the supine, prone and left decubitus positions, respectively. Combined scanning increased the percentage of adequate distension to 98.5% for prone-supine and 97.7% for left decubitus-supine scanning ( P<0.0005 compared to supine, P=0.001 compared to left decubitus and P=0.046 compared to prone scanning). Absence of residual material was found in approximately 62.7, 69.7 and 64% of segments in the supine, prone and left decubitus positions, respectively. Combined scanning increased this percentage to approximately 99% for both groups. No significant differences towards distension or residual material were found between combined supine-prone or supine-left decubitus scanning. In the supine-prone group, combined scanning additionally revealed four lesions and improved conspicuity in two cases of stalked polyps. In the supine-left decubitus group, combined scanning additionally revealed two lesions and improved conspicuity in one stalked polyp. There were significantly fewer breathing artefacts with left decubitus scanning than prone scanning ( P=0.005). A strong positive correlation was found between breathing artefacts and the age of patients in both patient groups. Colonic distension and preparation is improved by using supine and prone or supine and left decubitus scanning in combination, with a subsequent improved polyp detection. There were no significant differences between the two scanning protocols. Prone scanning, however, is hampered by breathing artefacts, especially in the elderly. Therefore, supine-left decubitus scanning is considered a valuable alternative to supine-prone scanning for the elderly."
CD011126,0,14986051,0,Colonic surveillance by CT colonography using axial images only.,"Patients at increased risk of colon cancer require strict colon surveillance. Our objective was to establish the efficacy of 2D axial CT colonography as a surveillance test when performed in routine clinical practice. Eighty-two patients at increased risk of colon cancer underwent CT colonography followed by conventional colonoscopy on the same morning. CT colonography studies were performed on a four-ring multidetector CT scanner (100 mAs, 120 kVp, 4 x 2.5 collimation) and were interpreted by two radiologists using 2D axial images only. Results were correlated with findings at colonoscopy. Note was made of subsequent histology reports from polypectomy specimens. A total of 52 polyps were detected at colonoscopy. Using 2D axial images alone, with no recourse to 2D multiplanar or 3D views, the sensitivity of CT colonography was 100, 33 and 19% for polyps larger than 9, 6-9 and smaller than 6 mm, respectively. Per-patient specificities were 98.8, 96 and 81.5%, respectively. Twenty-nine percent of polyps smaller than 1 cm were adenomatous and there were no histological features of severe dysplasia. CT colonography is a useful colon surveillance tool for patients at increased risk of colon cancer. It has a high specificity for identifying patients who should proceed to colonoscopy and polypectomy, while allowing further colon examination to be deferred in patients with normal studies. Using 2D axial images only, CT colonography can be performed as part of the daily CT workload, with a very low rate of referral for unnecessary colonoscopy."

CD011126,0,15668608,0,The case for less-than-monthly progestogen in women on HT: is transvaginal ultrasound the key?,"Unopposed estrogen (previously called ERT, now referred to as ET) increases a patient's risk of endometrial cancer. The addition of a progestogen to estrogen (previously called HRT, now referred to as HT) will decrease that additional risk of endometrial cancer although it will not eliminate it. Initially this was always done in a sequential fashion. More recently, continuous-combined HT, utilizing daily progestogen, has been popularized. Increasingly, published data points to progestogen and estrogen together causing an increase in the risk of breast cancer two to three times above that of estrogen alone. In the past, less-than-monthly progestogen has been attempted. It results in less bleeding, as well as some simple hyperplasia. Transvaginal ultrasound has a very poor positive predictive value (4% for serious endometrial disease and 9% for any endometrial disease) but a very high negative predictive value (99%) when the echo is distinct, and thin (<5 mm). Thus, patients with an initial thin distinct endometrial echo can begin with unopposed estrogen. At 3 months, they get a progestogen withdrawal of 12 days and the endometrial echo is measured again. If thin and distinct (<5 mm), the interval between progestogen withdrawals can be further increased and in some women potentially eliminated. If the echo is not sufficiently thin, although this does not necessarily indicate anything more than proliferative endometrium, those patients may require either monthly progestogen or continuous-combined HT. The advantage for the successful patient is less progestogen exposure, as little as 24 days per year in most patients, and less bleeding (although because the majority will bleed, the patient has to be willing to accept a withdrawal bleed that she has planned and can control the timing of by when she chooses to take the progestogen). The patient should have an easily visible thin endometrial echo before initiation. Some women will not lend themselves to a reliable assessment of the endometrial echo (at least not without saline infusion enhancement). Examples of such patients are those with an axial uterus, coexisting fibroids, marked obesity, and previous endometrial ablation. Such an approach will allow a large number of patients whose initial endometrial echo is easily visualized to minimize their progestogen dose."

These may need surgical correction which could restore fertility. This review aim to determine which examinations should be performed first. Hysterosalpingography shows sensitivity of only 65% but it increases the achievement of spontaneous pregnancy by three times. Office hysteroscopy has an excellent sensitivity (>95%) for diagnosing intra-uterine lesions. Pelvic ultrasound, whose good sensitivity is improved by adding 3D imaging and hysterosonography, seems as efficient as office hysteroscopy in diagnosing uterine cavity abnormalities. Moreover, it also efficiently diagnoses pelvic diseases such as hydrosalpinx or endometrioma without laparoscopy. A first line laparoscopy is indicated in for woman suspected of endometriosis or tubal pathology (history of complicated appendicitis, previous pelvic surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease). For the others straight forward cases, the majority of patients, hysterosalpingography and pelvic ultrasound seem to be sufficient as primary diagnostic tool."
CD011126,0,15053246,0,Adrenal adenoma and normal androgen levels in a young woman with polycystic ovaries: a case of idiopathic hirsutism?,"A case of unusual combination of polycystic ovaries (PCO), adrenal non-functioning adenoma and severe hirsutism in a young woman from Southern Italy is reported here. A 18-yr-old woman was referred to our Department because of oligomenhorrea, acne and severe hirsutism. During evaluation of the cause of her symptoms, PCO and small left adrenal adenoma were revealed. Although adrenal androgen excess has been shown to dysregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, causing PCO-like syndrome, normal circulating androgen values were found. Androgens and cortisol levels were completely suppressed by low-dose dexamethasone test, excluding autonomous steroid secretion by the adrenal mass. Normal response of cortisol and adrenal androgens to corticotropin stimulation test permitted the exclusion of functional adrenal hyperandrogenism. Despite normal LH/FSH ratio, anovulatory cycles were revealed by persistently low progesterone values. Glucose and insulin response to oral glucose tolerance test did not differ from those of normal population. The patient showed an improvement of acne and hirsutism on therapy with estro-progestins (EP). In conclusion, despite normal pattern of serum androgens and LH/FSH ratio, this patient had anovulatory cycles and good response to the EP treatment. These findings suggest that ultrasonography evidence of PCO together with anovulatory cycles contributed to her clinical picture whereas adrenal adenoma seemed to have no relevant role. This case report underlines the need of cautious interpretation of imaging results and clinical signs of severe hirsutism, reminding one that the true cause of a medical problem may not be the most evident."

CD011126,0,19940658,0,Deformable registration of supine and prone colons for computed tomographic colonography.,"Computed tomographic colonography is a minimally invasive technique for detecting colorectal polyps and colon cancer. Most computed tomographic colonography protocols acquire both prone and supine images to improve the visualization of the lumen wall, reduce false-positives, and improve sensitivity. Comparisons between the prone and supine images can be improved by registration between the scans. In this paper, we propose registering colon lumens, segmented from prone and supine images, using feature matching of the colon centerline and nonrigid registration of the lumen shapes represented as distance functions. Experimental registration results (n = 21 subjects) show a correspondence accuracy of 13.77 +/- 6.20 mm for a range of polyp sizes. The overlap in the registered lumen segmentations show an average Jaccard similarity coefficient of 0.915 +/- 0.07."

However, the significantly large amount of β-hCG in molar pregnancy may paradoxically lead to a false-negative result due to a phenomenon known as the 'high dose hook effect'.

CD011126,0,17459935,0,Highly conserved configuration of catalytic amino acid residues among calicivirus-encoded proteases.,"A common feature of caliciviruses is the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein catalyzed by the viral 3C-like protease encoded in open reading frame 1 (ORF1). Here we report the identification and structural characterization of the protease domains and amino acid residues in sapovirus (SaV) and feline calicivirus (FCV). The in vitro expression and processing of a panel of truncated ORF1 polyproteins and corresponding mutant forms showed that the functional protease domain is 146 amino acids (aa) in SaV and 154 aa in FCV. Site-directed mutagenesis of the protease domains identified four amino acid residues essential to protease activities: H(31), E(52), C(116), and H(131) in SaV and H(39), E(60), C(122), and H(137) in FCV. A computer-assisted structural analysis showed that despite high levels of diversity in the primary structures of the protease domains in the family Caliciviridae, the configurations of the H, E, C, and H residues are highly conserved, with these residues positioned closely along the inner surface of the potential binding cleft for the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the H, E, C, and H residues are involved in the formation of a conserved catalytic surface of the SaV and FCV 3C-like proteases."
CD011126,0,18081941,0,Cervical cerclage: a review of the evidence.,"Cervical insufficiency is a difficult and confusing diagnosis. Its diagnostic criteria, etiology, and treatment are all debated. Cervical cerclage has been a common practice in obstetrics since it was first described by Shirodker and then McDonald in the 1950s. Cerclages have been placed because of a patient's obstetrical history, physical examination, ultrasound, or a combination of the above. However, the data supporting cerclage placement is limited. There has never been a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of cerclage versus no cerclage in patients with a classic history of cervical insufficiency (multiple painless second trimester losses occurring at progressively earlier gestational ages). This article attempts to review the relevant studies regarding cerclage placement for the treatment of cervical insufficiency. Based on the current literature, there is evidence supporting cervical cerclage in the following limited circumstances: a history of 3 or more spontaneous preterm births or second trimester losses; a high-risk patient with a singleton pregnancy who has a short cervix in the second trimester. Because the majority of patients with risk factors for preterm birth and second trimester loss (poor obstetric history, short cervix) will still deliver at term or near-term, studies on the effectiveness of cervical cerclage would need many patients to be powered appropriately."
CD011126,0,19081685,0,[Hygiene in endovaginal gynecologic and obstetrical ultrasound in 2008].,"Hygiene of ultrasound probes is a hot topic in obstetric and gynecologic ultrasound. The issue concerns mainly the risk of contamination and the need for specific procedures to ensure a high degree of protection against infectious diseases, even if a disposable barrier cover is used. As there are no referenced quality criteria for these disposable probe covers, it is crucial to verify that they are CE marked. The use of condoms as probe covers is not recommended even though they present a lower rate of disruption compared to commercial probe covers. The global rate of probe cover perforation is of 1 to 9%. To date, there are no case reports of contamination by ultrasound examination, be it vaginal or abdominal. Nevertheless, every patient must be regarded as a potential source of infection. The French recommendations consider endovaginal ultrasound probes as semi-critical instruments and thus require intermediate-level disinfection. Because of the risk of disruption, American as well as Canadian and Australian recommendations insist on high-level disinfection of the probe. Every operator should follow reasonable hygiene rules and appropriate precautions should be taken in order to reassure the patients about the risks of contamination during any ultrasound examination."

Concomitant development of endometrial adenocarcinoma in APA remains infrequent. We report a case of the coexistence of endometrioid adenocarcinoma in APA. A 41-year-old patient presented with abnormal genital bleeding. A polypoid mass was extruded from the external cervical os. She underwent transcervical resection of the polypoid mass arising from the lower uterine segment. Pathological examination revealed APA with the foci of well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Subsequently, she underwent total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. No residual malignant lesions were found. Awareness of the close association of APA with the development of endometrial cancer is warranted.

However, while its potential as a screening test is undoubted, there are several current limitations that will need to be overcome before it can be considered seriously by health policy makers. These revolve around issues of generalisability, which is inhibited most by a lack of trained observers and access to CT scanners, and a paucity of data relating to cost-effectiveness.

CD011126,0,20160682,0,Comparison of a 3-D multi-group SN particle transport code with Monte Carlo for intracavitary brachytherapy of the cervix uteri.,"A patient dose distribution was calculated by a 3D multi-group S N particle transport code for intracavitary brachytherapy of the cervix uteri and compared to previously published Monte Carlo results. A Cs-137 LDR intracavitary brachytherapy CT data set was chosen from our clinical database. MCNPX version 2.5.c, was used to calculate the dose distribution. A 3D multi-group S N particle transport code, Attila version 6.1.1 was used to simulate the same patient. Each patient applicator was built in SolidWorks, a mechanical design package, and then assembled with a coordinate transformation and rotation for the patient. The SolidWorks exported applicator geometry was imported into Attila for calculation. Dose matrices were overlaid on the patient CT data set. Dose volume histograms and point doses were compared. The MCNPX calculation required 14.8 hours, whereas the Attila calculation required 22.2 minutes on a 1.8 GHz AMD Opteron CPU. Agreement between Attila and MCNPX dose calculations at the ICRU 38 points was within +/- 3%. Calculated doses to the 2 cc and 5 cc volumes of highest dose differed by not more than +/- 1.1% between the two codes. Dose and DVH overlays agreed well qualitatively. Attila can calculate dose accurately and efficiently for this Cs-137 CT-based patient geometry. Our data showed that a three-group cross-section set is adequate for Cs-137 computations. Future work is aimed at implementing an optimized version of Attila for radiotherapy calculations."

Secondary aims were to correlate flow volume to placental site and to UtA Pulsatility Index (PI). Women with singleton, low-risk pregnancies were examined at mid and late gestation. The structure and course of the uterine artery (UtA) was studied in each patient by means of 3D-angio-Doppler and included vessel diameter D, blood flow velocity and PI (measured along the UtA). Fetal weight estimation and placental insertion site were assessed by ultrasound. A robust fluid-dynamic modeling was applied to calculate absolute flow and flow per unit fetal weight. Mean UtA diameter and blood flow velocity increased significantly (p < 0.0001) from mid-gestation to late gestation from 2.6 mm and 67.5 cm/s, to 3.0 mm and 85.3 cm/s, respectively, yielding an increasing absolute flow troughout gestation. h coefficient, derived by fluid-dynamic modeling to calculate mean velocity, increased significantly from 0.52 at mid-gestation to 0.57 at late gestation. UtA blood flow volume ml/min/kg-fetal weight was significantly higher at mid-gestation than at late gestation (535 ml/min/kg vs 193 ml/min/kg; p < 0.0001). In cases with strictly lateral placentas the ipsilateral UtA accommodates at mid and late gestation 63% and 67% of the total UtA flow. In central placentas UtA flow was evenly distributed between the two vessels. An inverse correlation was observed between PI and blood flow volume ml/min/kg (Pearson's coefficient r = -0.54). Our work confirms the technological and methodological limitations in the measurement of uterine artery blood flow. However, Doppler measurements supported by three-dimensional angio imaging of the uterine vessel, high resolution imaging and diameter measurement, and a robust mathematical model of local circulation adds a genuine new area of investigation into human uterine circulation during pregnancy."

As a result of their low prevalence, the occurrence of CSP and a UAP in the same patient is extremely rare. The authors describe a patient who was initially misdiagnosed with trophoblastic disease by ultrasonography. The lesion had a blood-rich area of 75 x 65 x 61 mm on ultrasonography. Pelvic angiography revealed a UAP in the right side of the uterus. The patient underwent uterine artery embolization (UAE) immediately after the correct diagnosis was confirmed. Curettage was undertaken under ultrasound guidance one week postoperatively.

Arteriovenous malformation of the uterus may be congenital, associated with early pregnancy loss, trophoblastic disease, or surgical procedures. We describe a case of uterine arteriovenous malformation as a consequence of a scar pregnancy, complicated by recurrent, serious bleeding. The condition was diagnosed using three-dimensional ultrasound with color Doppler and magnetic resonance imaging and appears not to have been described before. Selective embolization was performed, but eventually surgical intervention with resection of the affected uterine segment was necessary, and the patient recovered.

CD011126,0,22411936,0,Migration of intrauterine devices: radiologic findings and implications for patient care.,"Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are a commonly used form of contraception worldwide. However, migration of the IUD from its normal position in the uterine fundus is a frequently encountered complication, varying from uterine expulsion to displacement into the endometrial canal to uterine perforation. Different sites of IUD translocation vary in terms of their clinical significance and subsequent management, and the urgency of communicating IUD migration to the clinician is likewise variable. Expulsion or intrauterine displacement of the IUD leads to decreased contraceptive efficacy and should be clearly communicated, since it warrants IUD replacement to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Embedment of the IUD into the myometrium can usually be managed in the outpatient clinical setting but occasionally requires hysteroscopic removal. Complete uterine perforation, in which the IUD is partially or completely within the peritoneal cavity, requires surgical management, and timely and direct communication with the clinician is essential in such cases. Careful evaluation for intraabdominal complications is also important, since they may warrant urgent or emergent surgical intervention. The radiologist plays an important role in the diagnosis of IUD migration and should be familiar with its appearance at multiple imaging modalities."

Diagnosis is based on endoscopy (identifies the lesion, permits histological sample under visual control, and minimally invasive treatment for polypoid benign tumors). Ultrasonography, being non-invasive and very accessible, is often used as the initial imaging procedure to detect or exclude digestive pathology with similar symptoms. Understanding digestive ultrasound is conditioned by the image quality which can be achieved by removing air and food debris. Even so, the characteristics of the inflammatory diseases and the detection of tumors, particularly those with endoluminal development, can be difficult. In recent years transabdominal ultrasound examination of the digestive tract was supplemented with more precise methods of investigation of the lumen and circulation of the intestinal wall. These methods are represented by the administration of oral or ano-rectal homogenous substances (hydrosonography) and the by intravenous administration of agents containing stabilized microbubbles (CEUS). With these methods useful information are being obtained, high in sensitivity and specificity of lesions characterization.

CD011126,0,19631481,0,Testing ovarian reserve to predict age at menopause.,"In modern society with women delaying pregnancy, predicting the age of the natural menopause with its preceding infertility will allow making informed choices about when to try starting to have children. Also if premature menopause could be predicted in young women, strategies could be instigated to reduce the long term health risks of early estrogen deficiency. This review examines the physiology of ovarian ageing, with the menopause being the final outcome. Long and short term predictive markers of the age of the menopause and the preceding natural infertility are evaluated. Many subtle changes in the endocrine regulation of ovarian function with advancing age may seem interesting but currently are not clinically useful as a predictive test. Examples are changes in concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and activin, as well as follicle dynamics. Other features hold more promise. Among these are chronological age, family history, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), poor response to in vitro fertilization (IVF), basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and the antral follicle count for long term prediction. For short term prediction, cycle shortening and occurrence of vasomotor symptoms may prove useful. To date, none of these markers has been found to have sufficient predictive accuracy in individual women. Results of new and ongoing longitudinal studies may provide better predictive models. In particular, use of genetic profiles may add to the accuracy of currently known markers."

This was a retrospective study of women with renal impairment seen at the University of the West Indies Hospital, Jamaica, between 2000 and 2004, looking at aetiology and severity (group 1). We also evaluated patients, in the same hospital, with fibroids who had ultrasonography during a later period (2006-2011), comparing those who had hydronephrosis and those without (group 2). In group 1, 274 women were coded as renal impairment. Case notes for 160 patients (59%) were analysed. Uterine fibroids accounted for 13/160 (8.1%) of cases. Comparing cases with and without fibroids, none of those with fibroids were over 50 years old compared with 59.3% of the others, OR 0.02 (CI 0.00-0.35) p = 0.0001. Hospital data for renal failure showed that most mean values were significantly better for those with fibroids. Urea, 8.59 mmol/l (SD 9.89) vs 17.00 mmol/l (SD 13.41) p = 0.003; Creatinine 300.15 μmol/l (SD490.92) vs 424.05 μmol/l (SD553.29) p = 0.022 and Creatinine clearance 73.21 ml/min (SD 38.92) vs 44.25 ml/min (SD 49.71) p = 0.017. However, mean potassium values were similar, 4.52 mmol/l (SD 0.61) vs 4.85 mmol/l (SD1.03) p = 0.2. In group 2, there were 216 patients and we found 31 (14.35%) patients at ultrasonography with hydronephrosis from fibroids. These patients had significantly larger uteri than those without hydronephrosis but renal function was similar, with only urea values significantly worse. Leiomyomas can cause renal impairment, however the prognosis appears good."

We retrospectively reviewed 200 patients treated for gonadotroph cell adenoma in our institute and identified 26 women of reproductive age. Two of these 26 patients had a history of ovarian cysts. One patient was considered to have had typical ovarian hyperstimulation, successfully treated by transsphenoidal surgery.

CD011126,0,22183184,0,Female pelvic floor dysfunction--an imaging perspective.,"Female pelvic floor dysfunction encompasses a range of morbidities, including urinary incontinence, female pelvic organ prolapse, anal incontinence and obstructed defecation. Patients often present with symptoms covered by several specialties including gastroenterology, colorectal surgery, urology and gynecology. Imaging can therefore bring clinicians from multiple specialties together by revealing that we frequently deal with different aspects of one underlying problem or pathophysiological process. This article provides an interdisciplinary imaging perspective on the pelvic floor. Modern pelvic floor imaging comprises defecation proctography, translabial and endorectal ultrasound, and static and dynamic MRI. This Perspectives focuses on the potential use of translabial ultrasound, including 3D and 4D applications, for diagnosis of pelvic floor disorders. Over the next decade, pelvic floor imaging will most likely be integrated into mainstream diagnostics in obstetrics and gynecology and colorectal surgery. Using imaging to facilitate communication between different specialties has the potential to greatly improve the multidisciplinary management of complex pelvic floor disorders."

Germline mutations in the FH gene encoding fumarate hydratase cause autosomal dominant syndromes multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomata and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). Few data have been published on the role of FH gene mutation in development of uterine fibroids outside the context of multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomata /HLRCC. We report two FH gene mutations, one novel and one previously described, in two young patients with sporadic uterine fibroids and decreased fumarate hydratase activity in lymphocytes. In patient 1, a novel heterozygous mutation c.892G>C was found. In patient 2 we detected heterozygous mutation c.584T>C. Both the patients had a negative family history for renal cancer and cutaneous leiomyomatosis. None of the relatives, however, underwent renal imaging at the time of writing. FH mutation carriers may be easily identified by analysis of fumarate hydratase activity in blood lymphocytes.

Digital transvaginal ultrasound endometrial images were acquired from 65 perimenopausal and post-menopausal women prior to gynaecological operations; histology revealed 15 malignant and 50 benign cases. Images were processed with a wavelet-based contrast enhancement technique. Three regions of interest (ROIs) were identified (endometrium, endometrium plus adjacent myometrium, layer containing endometrial-myometrial interface) on each original and processed image. 32 textural features were extracted from each ROI employing first and second order statistics texture analysis algorithms. Textural features-based models were generated for differentiating benign from malignant endometrial tissue using stepwise logistic regression analysis. Models' performance was evaluated by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The best logistic regression model comprised seven textural features extracted from the ROIs determined on the processed images; three features were extracted from the endometrium, while four features were extracted from the layer containing the endometrial-myometrial interface. The area under the ROC curve (A(z)) was 0.956+/-0.038, providing 86.0% specificity at 93.3% sensitivity using the cut-off level of 0.5 for probability of malignancy. Texture analysis of 2D grayscale transvaginal ultrasound images can effectively differentiate malignant from benign endometrial tissue and may contribute to computer-aided diagnosis of endometrial cancer."

This percentage is fivefold higher than that registered in the 1970s. Since 1970 there has been a two-fold increase in the ratio of ectopic pregnancies to all reported pregnancies in Hungary and in 2012 7.4 ectopic pregnancies per thousand registered pregnancies were reported. Recently, the majority (80%) of cases can be diagnosed in early stage, and the related mortality objectively decreased in the past few decades to 3.8/10,000 ectopic pregnancies. If a woman with positive pregnancy test has abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding the physician should perform a work-up to safely exclude the possibility of ectopic pregnancy. The basis of diagnosis is ultrasonography, especially vaginal ultrasound examination and measurement of the β-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin. The ultrasound diagnosis is based on the visualization of an ectopic mass rather than the inability to visualize an intrauterine pregnancy. In some questionable cases the diagnostic uterine curettage or laparoscopy may be useful. The actuality of this topic is justified by practical difficulties in obtaining correct diagnosis, especially in the early gestational time."

Each group recommended that the outflow tracts of the fetal heart be examined if technically feasible. One method to accomplish this task is to perform a free-hand sweep of the transducer beam directed in a transverse plane from the 4-chamber view to the fetal neck. One problem with this approach is that the examiner may not direct the beam transversely and, therefore, may not accurately identify the outflow tract anatomy."

CD011126,0,20870363,0,[Which is the method of choice for evaluating uterine cavity in infertility workup?].,"Uterine factors represent only 2 to 3 % of infertility, but intra-uterine lesions are much more common in infertile women (40-50 %). These lesions can interfere with spontaneous fertility and can compromise pregnancy rates in assisted reproduction. Exploration of the uterine cavity is actually one of the basic explorations in infertility workup. Classically, hysterosalpingography and transvaginal sonography are most communally used for this purpose. Hysteroscopy, with the development and miniaturization of equipment, is currently simple, outpatient cost-effective exploration and it is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of intrauterine lesions. However, the benefit of the systematic use of hysteroscopy in the initial assessment of infertility remains unclear and the exploration of the uterine cavity in the initial assessment of infertility should be based on hysterosalpingography or hysterosonography. Systematic hysteroscopy before IVF is widely accepted practice that is supposed to improve pregnancy rates but still lacks scientific evidence. After repeated implantation failure in IVF cycles, uterine cavity should be reevaluated by hysteroscopy and this practice has been demonstrated to improve pregnancy rates."

Forty-two patients suffering CC at different stages were enrolled in this study. Firstly, we proposed a new tumor segmentation method by combining the intensity and gradient field information in a level set framework. Secondly, fifty-four 3D texture features were studied besides of SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV). Through correlation analysis, receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves analysis, some independent indices showed statistically significant differences between the early stage (ES, stages I and II) and the advanced stage (AS, stages III and IV). Then the tumors represented by those independent indices could be automatically classified into ES and AS, and the most discriminative feature could be chosen. Finally, the robustness of the optimal index with respect to sampling schemes and the quality of the PET images were validated. Using the proposed segmentation method, the dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance were 91.78   ±   1.66% and 7.94   ±   1.99 mm, respectively. According to the correlation analysis, all the fifty-eight indices could be divided into 20 groups. Six independent indices were selected for their highest areas under the ROC curves (AUROC), and showed significant differences between ES and AS (P  <  0.05). Through automatic classification with the support vector machine (SVM) Classifier, run percentage (RP) was the most discriminative index with the higher accuracy (88.10%) and larger AUROC (0.88). The Pearson correlation of RP under different sampling schemes is 0.9991   ±   0.0011. RP is a highly stable feature and well correlated with tumor stage in CC, which suggests it could differentiate ES and AS with high accuracy."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now widely used as a problem-solving tool in these circumstances. The purpose of this review is to provide the discriminative MRI features of Fallopian tube masses and illustrate the key signs that establish their origin and nature. Familiarity with these characteristics enables distinction of tubal disease from malignant adnexal disease with major impact on management. On MRI, Fallopian tube disease exhibits features that parallel the classical sonographic findings, but which can be more reliably recognized due to improved contrast and spatial resolution, multiplanar capacity, effective field of view, and tissue characterization. Recognition of these characteristic morphological features and specific MRI signal patterns are key to a specific diagnosis. The anatomical and histopathological basis of these MRI signs is emphasized, covering also the differential diagnosis and pitfalls. Two new signs, ""synechiae"" and ""amorphous shading"", are also described that have not been well described previously in MRI of tubal disease."

CD011126,0,21213512,0,Modern management of preterm labour.,"Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Cervical insufficiency is not an all or nothing phenomenon but a continuous variable which can lead to preterm deliveries at different gestational ages. The relationship between shortened cervical length and spontaneous preterm birth is consistent in several studies. Shortened cervical length can be diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonography and treated by transvaginal cervical cerclage (TCC). A nomenclature to the different stages of prevention, as primary, secondary and tertiary was suggested to facilitate comparison of studies. Apart from cervical cerclage, the most widely used tocolytics are betamimetics. Although they have been shown to delay delivery, betamimetics have not been shown to improve perinatal outcome, and they have a high frequency of unpleasant and even fatal and maternal side effects. There is growing interest in calcium channel blockers which appear to be more effective than beta-sympathomimetic drugs and have few side-effects."
CD011126,0,24338249,0,Portal vein thrombosis after laparoscopic splenectomy during childhood.,"Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) and can lead to bowel ischemia or portal hypertension. In childhood, this complication is reported in 5-10 % of the cases whereas it can be up to 50 % in adult population. Our aim was to evaluate PVT incidence after LS and associated risks factors. A retrospective chart review identified 37 children who underwent elective LS from 2005 to 2013. The main indications were spherocytosis or sickle cell disease. Median age and weight were respectively 7.4 years and 25.1 kg. Thromboembolic prophylaxis was not routinely given. Duration of surgery was 129 min and hospital length of stay 4 days. Doppler ultrasound scan (USS) was performed post-operatively in 26 cases. Post-operative course was uneventful in all but one patient. She was a 17 year-old girl previously operated for an ovarian tumor with hyperandrogenism. Histopathology revealed a splenic lymphoma. At day 4, a systematic USS showed a PVT extending in the portal branches. Therapeutic low molecular weight heparin was used and then transitioned to fluindione for 3 months. Follow-up USS performed at 1 and 4 months demonstrated complete resolution of the PVT. PVT after pediatric LS is a rare event in our series. Clinician should be cautious in oncologic cases and if very large spleen or if thrombocythemia >650.10(9)/L is present. If detected early, PVT can be treated efficiently. We therefore recommend a systematic USS during the first postoperative week."

Uterine and umbilical artery blood flow velocity waveforms were determined in 21 pregnancies complicated by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): 12 with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), 9 without aPL. We also studied 7 pregnancies with APS. This retrospective study was running from January 1st 1986 to July 31st 1991, at the Port-Royal Maternity, Paris, France. Abnormal uterine artery blood flow velocity waveforms were found in 10 out of 28 pregnancies at the first examination performed between 20 and 30 weeks gestational age. All the later adverse fetal and neonatal events were predicted by an abnormal uterine artery blood flow velocity waveform. From the 7 cases of fetal distress diagnosed during pregnancy, 6 were predicted by abnormal uterine waveforms and all of these pregnancies resulted in induced delivery before 32 weeks of gestational age. Twelve pregnancies with aPL and normal uterine artery waveforms were uncomplicated. Only 1 out of 7 pregnancies with abnormal uterine artery waveform and aPL ended without complication. Determination of uterine artery flow velocity waveform is a good adjunct to the management of pregnancies complicated by SLE or aPL. This determination has a better predictive value than the presence of aPL."

The diagnosis is often delayed because of the non-specific nature of symptoms and a lack of specific and accurate diagnostic tests, that is, CA125 and ultrasound. In premenopausal women these issues are compounded, further reducing the likelihood of an accurate and early diagnosis.

CD011126,0,24961675,0,Hysteroscopy- and laparoscopy-based diagnosis and treatment of girls with unbroken hymen with an obstructing uterine septum: two case reports.,"Obstructing uterine septum is a rare uterine malformation. Patients with obstructing uterine septum are usually treated with laparouterotomy, causing obvious injury to both the uterus and body of the patients. Therefore, using the natural channel of the vagina is undoubtedly the best way to carry out the surgery. However, obstructing uterine septum usually occurs in puberty in girls without a history of sexual intercourse, thus iatrogenic damage to the hymen during the diagnosis and treatment cannot probably be avoided. However, Chinese people traditionally tend to use hymen intactness as a standard to judge whether an unmarried woman is chaste. Therefore, in China, to protect the hymen from damage during hysteroscopic diagnosis and treatment is of special significance for girls and women with unbroken hymens. None of the previously reported cases were treated with electrosurgical obstructing uterine septum excision based on B-ultrasound-guided hymen-protecting hysteroscopy and laparoscopy."

CD011126,0,21147593,0,Three-dimensional reconstruction of the digestive wall in capsule endoscopy videos using elastic video interpolation.,"Wireless capsule endoscopy is a revolutionary technology that allows physicians to examine the digestive tract of a human body in the minimum invasive way. Physicians can detect diseases such as blood-based abnormalities, polyps, ulcers, and Crohn's disease. Although this technology is really a marvel of our modern times, currently it suffers from two serious drawbacks: 1) frame rate is low (3 frames/s) and 2) no 3-D representation of the objects is captured from the camera of the capsule. In this paper we offer solutions (methodologies) that deal with each of the above issues improving the current technology without forcing hardware upgrades. These methodologies work synergistically to create smooth and visually friendly interpolated images from consecutive frames, while preserving the structure of the observed objects. They also extract and represent the texture of the surface of the digestive tract in 3-D. Thus the purpose of our methodology is not to reduce the time that the gastroenterologists need to spend to examine the video. On the contrary, the purpose is to enhance the video and therefore improve the viewing of the digestive tract leading to a more qualitative and efficient examination. The proposed work introduces 3-D capsule endoscopy textured results that have been welcomed by Digestive Specialists, Inc., Dayton, OH. Finally, illustrative results are given at the end of the paper."

CD011126,0,22246932,0,Fractal dimension of chromatin texture of squamous intraepithelial lesions of cervix.,"The aim of this study was to explore the role of fractal dimension (FD) of chromatin texture in routinely stained Papanicolaou's smears and to distinguish the different grades of cervical intraepithelial lesions and normal cervical cells. We selected 14 each cases of normal, low grade cervical intra epithelial lesions (LSIL), and high-grade cervical intra epithelial lesions (HSIL) of Papanicolaou's stained cervical smears. Fractal dimension of the pseudo three-dimensional grey image of the nuclear chromatin was measured in 140 nuclei of each group. Mean FD of the normal cases, LSIL cases, and HSIL cases were 2.4225 ± 0.06410, 2.5159 ± 0.03291, and 2.5905 ± 0.06840, respectively. ANOVA test showed significant differences of mean FD in all these three groups (P < 0.000). Fractal dimension of the chromatin texture is easy to perform and can be done in routinely stained Papanicolaou's smear. It is reproducible and gives valuable information about the chromatin texture of the nucleus. In future, this promising variable can be incorporated along with other image morphometric features for accurate classification of dysplastic cells in cervical smear."

During anastrazole administration for 12 months, the endometrial thickness decreased from 9.8 mm to 2.4 mm and the control endometrial histology showed an atrophic endometrium. Uterine bleeding did not occur in the post-treatment, 3-year follow-up period. The endometrial thicknesses measured yearly by ultrasonography were 2.9, 3.5 and 3.3 mm. The plasma estradiol levels increased from < 73 pmol/l post-treatment to 112, 98 and 103 pmol/l. This case demonstrates that long-term aromatase inhibitor treatment can result in a refractory status of the endometrium and the estradiol produced in the adipose tissue does not exert a proliferative effect."

The current process involves clinical examination that can be subjective and prone to sampling errors. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for differentiation of normal and dysplastic oral epithelial samples, with a view to developing an objective and reproducible approach for biopsy site selection. Biopsy samples from patients with fibro-epithelial polyps (n = 13), mild dysplasia (n = 2), and moderate/severe dysplasia (n = 4) were scanned at 5-μm intervals using an OCT microscope and subsequently processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Epithelial differentiation was measured from the rate of change (gradient) of the backscattered light intensity in the OCT signal as a function of depth. This parameter is directly related to the density of optical scattering from the cell nuclei. OCT images of normal oral epithelium showed a clear delineation of the mucosal layers observed in the matching histology. However, OCT images of oral dysplasia did not clearly identify the individual mucosal layers because of the increased density of abnormal cell nuclei, which impeded light penetration. Quantitative analysis on 2D-OCT and histology images differentiated dysplasia from normal control samples. Similar analysis on 3D-OCT datasets resulted in the reclassification of biopsy samples into the normal/mild and moderate/severe groups. Quantitative differentiation of normal and dysplastic lesions using OCT offers a non-invasive objective approach for localizing the most representative site to biopsy, particularly in oral lesions with similar clinical features."

CD011126,0,23629476,0,"Endometrial surveillance in tamoxifen users: role, timing and accuracy of hysteroscopic investigation: observational longitudinal cohort study.","To determine the role, timing and indications for endometrial hysteroscopic investigation in relation to the clinical, ultrasound and histological features of the endometrium during tamoxifen (TAM) use. We performed an observational longitudinal cohort study (years 2007-2012) that investigated the endometria of 151 TAM users with hysteroscopy and histology. For all patients, gynaecological history, years of adjuvant treatment, ultrasound endometrial thickness measurement and indications for hysteroscopy were recorded. Hysteroscopic findings showed that 100% of patients referred for simple follow-up had no evidence of endometrial disease. We found a strong correlation between previous history of abnormal uterine bleeding (with or without endometrial thickening) and hysteroscopic suspicion of endometrial atypia that was confirmed by histology. Hysteroscopy had 83.3% sensitivity, 99% specificity, 83.3% positive predictive value (PPV) and 99% negative predictive value (NPV) in detecting endometrial atypia. No significant correlation was found between endometrial thickening to >5 mm without bleeding and histological atypia. Similarly, the duration of treatment was not related to endometrial thickening and histological atypia. Endometrial stromal hyperplasia was detected by histology in 70.5% of patients with endometrial thickness measurements ranging from 5 to 10 mm. In contrast, no atypia was detected when endometrial thickness was <5 mm. Ultrasound performed using a 5-mm cut-off threshold for endometrial thickness resulted in 100% sensitivity, 15% specificity, 4% PPV and 100% NPV in detecting endometrial atypia, while a 10-mm cut-off threshold resulted in 84% sensitivity, 69% specificity, 10% PPV and 99% NPV. Low-risk TAM users do not require different endometrial surveillance than the general population. Hysteroscopy could play a fundamental role in determining the endometrial status of patients before the initiation of TAM treatment and in assessing the endometrial status of patients when bleeding occurs."

CD011126,0,24914396,0,Solitary schwannoma of the gallbladder: a case report and literature review.,"Schwannomas occurring in the gallbladder are extremely rare. Preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder schwannomas appears to be very difficult because they are normally asymptomatic and are often found incidentally. Until now, only five cases have been reported in the literature. To our knowledge, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) features of gallbladder schwannomas have not been reported before in other studies. We treated a 55-year-old male patient with gallbladder schwannoma in China. He had no symptoms, and the lesion was incidentally found by conventional ultrasound (US) when performing a health examination. The patient had normal liver function; moreover, serum carcinoembryonic antigen and alpha-fetoprotein were within the normal ranges. The lesion showed no blood flow signals on color Doppler US, and the wall beneath the lesion was intact on CEUS. The lesion was believed to be a benign entity; in addition, gallbladder adenomyomatosis was suspected. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed to remove the mass. Pathological examination revealed that the tumor was mainly composed of spindle-shaped cells; neither atypical cells nor signs of malignancy were found. Immunohistochemical staining showed a strong positive S-100 protein reaction. Vimentin and CD56 staining were also positive, whereas CD34 and CD117 were negative. Finally, the lesion was diagnosed as schwannoma. Herein, we report the case; the associated literature is also reviewed."

CD011126,0,19060689,0,Adnexal masses in the pregnant patient: a diagnostic and management challenge.,"Ultrasound is a valuable diagnostic tool, which can be used to stratify pregnant women with adnexal masses into a conservative management protocol versus those that require further diagnostic and management decisions. Familiarity with the natural history and sonographic features of common adnexal lesions, such as simple cysts, hemorrhagic cysts, endometriomas, mature cystic teratomas, and ovarian conditions specific to pregnancy, may permit stratification of patients into management protocols. The goal of ultrasound evaluation in the pregnant patient with an adnexal mass is to identify those patients in whom conservative management is appropriate versus those who require more immediate interventions such as surgery. The risk of surgical interventions needs to be balanced against the potential risks of nonintervention, which may include torsion, rupture, hemorrhage, or the rare spread of a malignant cancer. Atypical features or persistent large lesions should initiate a multidisciplinary team approach to optimize diagnostic and management strategy. Acute symptoms may precipitate emergency intervention at any point in the pregnancy. We will present a diagnostic and management algorithm based on clinical symptoms, timing of detection, natural history, and sonographic features of adnexal masses in pregnancy."

CD011126,0,16485411,0,Multiparametric fit method in reconstruction of Fletcher-Suit-Delclos applicator.,In our institution we have introduced the variable angle reconstruction method with a nonisocentric C-arm as brachytherapy localizer in gynecological treatments. The main advantage of this method is that on the posterior oblique images the ovoids of the Fletcher-Suit-Delclos (FSD) applicator are clearly separated. The main problem with the nonisocentric machine is that the magnification factor is not known exactly and varies with the C-arm angle. For generation of treatment plans with a commercial brachytherapy planning system the magnification factors of the reconstruction images have to be determined previously. We present a multiparametric fit method (MPF) that is suitable for reconstruction of FSD applicators and that utilizes pairs of posterior-anterior and lateral or preferably posterior oblique reconstruction images obtained by a C-arm. The MPF reconstruction relies on the known geometry of the tandem and the ovoid. The actual FSD insertion is reconstructed by adaptation of the geometry of tandem and ovoid by translations and rotations. The fixation mechanism limits the possible excursions of the FSD applicator's parts. The limited freedom of excursions and the determination of the magnification factors are also incorporated.

CD011126,0,18297861,0,[Urolithiasis and pregnancy].,"Urolithiasis disease during pregnancy fortunately is a relatively rare disease; nevertheless many times it complicates the diagnosis and treatment. This paper reviews the safety and efficacy of both and their relationships with mother and fetus and proposes different options for the urologist, gynecologist, and urogynecologist for the attention of pregnant women with suspicion of urolithiasis. The ultrasound seems to be the first-choice method during the pregnancy; it is available in many health centers and does not require too much experience for its interpretation. Intravenous urography, simple X-ray and magnetic resonance image with its limitations aid support to our clinical suspicion; additionally the uretheroscopy is the diagnostic and therapeutic method and can be used safely during the pregnancy; thus first-choice study is the ultrasound with changes in vascular resistance rates. Once diagnosis is established, conservative treatment is applied because the majority of patients has spontaneous elimination of stones (70 to 80%). Surgical intervention can be an option and when is needed, placement of an uretheral catheter JJ, percutaneous nephrostomy and uretheroscopy may be an option to definitive treatment."
CD011126,0,15056683,0,A functional connection between inferior frontal gyrus and orofacial motor cortex in human.,"The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) of humans is known to play a critical role in speech production. The IFG is a highly convoluted and cytoarchitectonically diverse structure, classically forming 3 subgyri. It is reasonable to speculate that during speaking the IFG, or some portion of it, influences by corticocortical connections the orofacial representational area of primary motor cortex. To test the hypothesis that such corticocortical connections exist, electrical-stimulation tract tracing experiments were performed intraoperatively on 14 human subjects undergoing surgical treatment of medically intractable epilepsy. Bipolar electrical stimulation was applied to sites on the IFG, while the resulting evoked potentials were recorded from orofacial motor cortex, using a multichannel recording array. Stimulation of the IFG evoked polyphasic waveforms on motor cortex of both language-dominant and -nondominant hemispheres. The evoked waveforms had consistent features across subjects. The responses were seen in discrete regions on precentral cortex. Stimulation of motor cortex also evoked responses on portions of IFG. The data provide evidence for a functional connection between the human IFG and orofacial motor cortex."

CD011126,0,9359646,0,Sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness as a predictor of vaginal bleeding in women using continuous combined hormone replacement therapy.,"The development of unpredictable vaginal bleeding is one of the main reasons for the discontinuation of treatment in users of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT). There is no accurate method of predicting which women will develop bleeding on this regimen. The aim of this study was to determine whether sonographic assessment of the endometrium could be used as a predictor of bleeding after the commencement of this treatment. Sonographic measurements of the endometrium were performed before treatment and then every 3 months for 1 year. Measurements of the endometrium were taken in both the transverse and sagittal planes and a record of the frequency of bleeding was maintained. Pretreatment measurements tended to be greater in those who developed bleeding within 1 month of the commencement of treatment, but the difference in measurements between those who developed bleeding and those who did not was not statistically significant. Endometrial thickness tended to be greater at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of treatment in those who had bleeding compared with those who did not, but again the difference was not statistically significant. It is concluded that whilst bleeding on continuous combined HRT is more common in women with a thicker endometrium, sonographic assessment of the endometrium is not an accurate enough predictor of bleeding to be used in this clinical setting."

CD011126,0,25520396,0,Wide-field computational imaging of pathology slides using lens-free on-chip microscopy.,"Optical examination of microscale features in pathology slides is one of the gold standards to diagnose disease. However, the use of conventional light microscopes is partially limited owing to their relatively high cost, bulkiness of lens-based optics, small field of view (FOV), and requirements for lateral scanning and three-dimensional (3D) focus adjustment. We illustrate the performance of a computational lens-free, holographic on-chip microscope that uses the transport-of-intensity equation, multi-height iterative phase retrieval, and rotational field transformations to perform wide-FOV imaging of pathology samples with comparable image quality to a traditional transmission lens-based microscope. The holographically reconstructed image can be digitally focused at any depth within the object FOV (after image capture) without the need for mechanical focus adjustment and is also digitally corrected for artifacts arising from uncontrolled tilting and height variations between the sample and sensor planes. Using this lens-free on-chip microscope, we successfully imaged invasive carcinoma cells within human breast sections, Papanicolaou smears revealing a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and sickle cell anemia blood smears over a FOV of 20.5 mm(2). The resulting wide-field lens-free images had sufficient image resolution and contrast for clinical evaluation, as demonstrated by a pathologist's blinded diagnosis of breast cancer tissue samples, achieving an overall accuracy of ~99%. By providing high-resolution images of large-area pathology samples with 3D digital focus adjustment, lens-free on-chip microscopy can be useful in resource-limited and point-of-care settings."

In a prospective blind study, two examiners measured the endometrial thickness in 48 patients presenting with PMB by transvaginal sonography on two separate occasions, 30 min apart. The analysis of variance performed at each endometrial thickness measured by the two examiners revealed no statistical difference. However, it was shown that the most accurate measurements are up to the level of 4 mm (mean deviation of 0.1 +/- 0.2 mm, range 0.7). Once the endometrial thickness reaches 5-6 mm the mean deviation becomes 0.3 +/- 1.2 mm with a range of variation of 4 mm. In conclusion, measurements of endometrial thickness in patients presenting with PMB can be repeated quite accurately up to a level of 4 mm thickness."

On testicular ultrasound examination, the presence of a testicular tumour was suspected in nine men. Of these, seven underwent an orchidectomy. A malignant tumour (seminomata) was present in five of these seven men, representing a malignancy incidence of 0.7% (5/749). In these five men, the semen was abnormal in three and normally fertile in the remaining two. In the two other men who underwent an orchidectomy, a benign Leydig cell tumour and an area of Sertoli cell-only were discovered, respectively. A watch was kept on the apparent tumour sites in the remaining two men, revealing no change in ultrasonic appearance over a period of 2-12 months. These data demonstrate that testicular tumours can present in an infertility clinic among men with normal as well as an abnormal semen analysis. A plea is made for the greater use of diagnostic ultrasound among infertile men."

Ninety-five per cent investigate women on tamoxifen only if they are symptomatic. Pelvic ultrasound and endometrial sampling are used for first-line investigation by 68.7%. Interpreting ultrasound findings, endometrial thickness is the parameter regarded as most important. An endometrial thickness of greater than 5 mm is regarded abnormal by 47.8% of respondents and of 4 mm by 23.6%. As there is no consensus of opinion regarding normal values for endometrial thickness, further data are required to ensure consistency when interpreting ultrasound reports of women on tamoxifen."

CD011126,0,24110188,0,Virtual colon flattening based on colonic outer surface.,"Virtual colon flattening (VF) is a non-invasive procedure to inspect the colonic inner surface for detecting colorectal polyps. Unfortunately, the performance of VF is impeded by deformation distortions of colonic inner surface. Conventionally, the colonic inner surface itself is used to correct deformation distortions. In this paper, we propose a colonic outer surface based VF method to correct distortions instead of colonic inner surface. The proposed method was validated with 60 cases and 200 annotated polyps. Visual inspections were carried out by three operators independently and were compared with three existing VF methods which are based on colonic inner surface. The correct detection rate of the proposed method and the three existing methods were 88.0%, 76.5%, 80.0% and 81.5% respectively. False positives per case were 0.16, 0.32, 0.21, and 0.26 respectively. The proposed method has higher correct detection rate and less false positives than the other three VF methods, demonstrating the usefulness of colonic outer surface as a correction tool for VF results."

When used as a screening test TV ultrasound has provided sensitivity rates of up to 100% about uterine anomalies. Improved depiction has been achieved with the development of hysterosalpingosonography (HSSG). The anechoic interface provided by the saline solution allows the examiner to determine whether an abnormality is intracavitary, endometrial, or submucosal.

Four hundred and ten women with PCOS were evaluated, while 97 healthy women served as controls. PCOS were defined by oligo-anovulation (OA), hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (PCO). Patients were subdivided into four phenotypes: OA + HA + PCO (phenotype 1), OA + HA (phenotype 2), HA + PCO (phenotype 3), OA + PCO (phenotype 4). Phenotypes 1-4 were present in 47.1%, 13.2%, 21.2% and 18.5% of patients, respectively. They were also divided into three groups according to the BMI (<25 kg/m(2); 25≤ and ≤30 kg/m(2); and >30 kg/m(2)). ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc HSD tests were used. The LH levels and LH/FSH ratio were higher in phenotype 1 and 2 than phenotype 3. The LDL-C levels were higher in women with phenotype 1 and 4 than in women with phenotype 2. Women with BMI <25 kg/m(2) had higher levels of LH, LH/FSH ratio, and the HDL-C than other two groups. The levels of TG, LDL, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR increased with increasing BMI in four phenotypes.

CD011126,0,21567140,0,Imaging of pediatric ovarian neoplasms.,"We review the clinical and imaging characteristics of the most common ovarian neoplasms in children and adolescents. Because of the widespread use of diagnostic imaging, incidental ovarian neoplasms might be encountered during the evaluation of abdominal pain, trauma or other indications and might pose a diagnostic dilemma. Conducting adequate imaging studies under these conditions is important, as management strategies differ according to the size and appearance of the lesion as well as the age of the patient. US dominates in gynecological imaging because of its excellent visualization, absence of ionizing radiation and sedation risks and comparatively low cost. For further examination of indeterminate lesions found using US, MRI is being used more progressively in this field, particularly for the evaluation of complex pelvic masses with the aim of distinguishing benign and malignant conditions and conditions requiring surgical intervention. CT is reserved primarily for tumor staging and follow-up and for emergency situations."
CD011126,0,18443326,0,Ovarian reserve.,"As a result of temporary social trends, many women elect to postpone their first pregnancy to a later stage in life. A large part of this population will be infertile by the time they opt to conceive, mainly because of a decreasing ovarian reserve and low oocyte quality resulting from age. Aging oocytes have been widely suggested to be the major cause for the decline in fertility. In a subfertile population, the availability of an accurate screening test of ovarian reserve would provide a valuable means of predicting the chances of pregnancy and live birth with or without treatment and selecting an optimal dose of ovarian stimulation where treatment using ovarian stimulation is planned. The following hormonal markers and ultrasound parameters have been used to attempt to estimate ovarian reserve and predict those with a poor chance of success in assisted reproductive techniques: age; concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, inhibin, anti-Müllerian hormone; ovarian volume, ovarian antral follicle count; and ovarian biopsy. Further studies have introduced the use of dynamic tests-using gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, FSH, or clomiphene citrate-to assess ovarian function. The use of a wide range of tests suggests that no single test provides a sufficiently accurate result. But the simultaneous evaluation of a combination of tests could be used as a marker of diminished ovarian reserve and a sensitive predictor of response to ovarian stimulation in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment."
CD011126,0,15653360,0,Electron capture dissociation of polypeptides in a three-dimensional quadrupole ion trap: Implementation and first results.,"The adverse influence of the radio frequency (RF) voltage on electrons has been the main obstacle for the implementation of electron capture dissociation (ECD) in three-dimensional quadrupole ion traps (3D QITs). Here we demonstrate that the use of axial magnetic field, together with the injection of low-energy (<5 eV) electrons, in the beginning of the positive RF semi-period achieves trapping of electrons for a period of time comparable with the semi-period duration. Importantly, the energy of the electrons remains low during most of the trapping period. With this technique, which we call ""magnetized electrons, in-phase injection"" (MEPhI), ECD and other ion-electron reactions have become possible in a 3D QIT. Initial ECD results, including single-scan data, were obtained with dications of Substance P. The observed secondary fragmentation of ECD fragments indicates that the trapped electrons are still somewhat hotter than desired."
CD011126,0,20078517,0,Polyorchidism: a three-case report and review of the literature.,"The presence of more than two testes confirmed by histology is called polyorchidism. Polyorchidism is an extremely rare congenital anomaly with a few more than 100 cases reported in the literature. The majority of reported cases are asymptomatic patients, others present with cryptorchidism, hydrocele, varicocele, epididymitis, infertility, testicular malignancy and testicular torsion. Over a 2-year period, we encountered three patients who were found to have polyorchidism; two men presented with cryptorchidism and one with chronic scrotal pain. Physical examination of the first and the third patient revealed normal testes in the scrotal sac, the other scrotal sac was empty and small solid mass (atrophic left testes) was palpated in the inguinal canal. Ultrasonographic examination of the scrotum and inguinal region confirmed the findings of the physical examination. Ultrasonographic examination of the second patient revealed supernumerary testes within the scrotum. Orchiectomy was made on the first and third patients' supernumerary testes and ipsilateral inguinal high ligation was applied for herniorrhaphy. A conservative approach was preferred for the second patient, maybe preserving a potentially functional supernumerary testis to improve the capacity for spermatogenesis. The risk of malignancy justifies the removal of an atrophic and ectopic testis in polyorchidism. However, it would appear safe to preserve a viable intrascrotal supernumerary testis found incidentally at surgery, provided that the patient is followed-up in the long term."

The majority of analyzed fibrils form a range of morphologies that show almost continuously altering structural properties. The observed fibril polymorphism implies that amyloid formation can lead, for the same polypeptide sequence, to many different patterns of inter- or intra-residue interactions.

The prognostic value of an ultrasonographic examination is higher in combination with the patient history and clinical findings. In order to achieve high diagnostic accuracy certain requirements are mandatory. Firstly a high level of expertise, meticulousness and patience of the examiner is crucial. Secondly the use of a high-end ultrasound machine is essential. Thirdly a thorough evaluation and interpretation of sonomorphologic findings are necessary. Furthermore, these skills have to be trained continuously. This is fundamental for subjective, sonographic pattern recognition and the successful use of tumor scores resulting in a correct classification of adnexal tumors. Most adnexal tumors (approximately 75%) can be correctly (sensitivity 95% and specificity 91%) classified as benign or malignant using a set of simple rules.

CD011126,0,18597921,0,Uterine ultrasonographic changes during endometriosis treatment: a comparison between levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.,"We compared the effects of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (LNG-IUD) and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) on uterine volume, uterine arteries pulsatility index (PI) and endometrial thickness before and after six months of endometriosis treatment. Sixty women aged 18-40 y were allocated randomly to one of two groups: LNG-IUDs were inserted in 30 women, and GnRHa monthly injections were performed on the other 30. All 60 women were submitted to transvaginal 2-D ultrasound scans on the day that the treatment started and then six months later. Measurements of uterine arteries PI, uterine volume and endometrial thickness were performed at both evaluations. The use of LNG-IUDs significantly decreased endometrial thickness (pre = 6.08 +/- 3.00 mm, post = 2.7 +/- 0.98 mm; mean +/- SD), as did the use of GnRHa (pre = 6.96 +/- 3.82 mm, post = 3.23 +/- 2.32 mm). The uterine volume decreased in the GnRHa group (pre = 86.67 +/- 28.38 cm(3), post = 55.27 +/- 25.52 cm(3)), but not in the LNG-IUD group (pre = 75.77 +/- 20.88 cm(3), post = 75.97 +/- 26.62 cm(3)). Uterine arteries PI increased for both groups; however, the increase was higher in the GnRHa group (0.99 +/- 0.84 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.84, p = 0.007; PI increase in GnRHa and in LNG-IUD groups, respectively). In conclusion, levonorgestrel released directly onto the endometrium by the LNG-IUD induced smaller uterine changes than did the hypoestrogenism induced by GnRHa. Nevertheless, both promoted similar effects on endometrial thickness."

CD011126,0,19235388,0,Optimizing computer-aided colonic polyp detection for CT colonography by evolving the Pareto fronta.,"A multiobjective genetic algorithm is designed to optimize a computer-aided detection (CAD) system for identifying colonic polyps. Colonic polyps appear as elliptical protrusions on the inner surface of the colon. Curvature-based features for colonic polyp detection have proved to be successful in several CT colonography (CTC) CAD systems. Our CTC CAD program uses a sequential classifier to form initial polyp detections on the colon surface. The classifier utilizes a set of thresholds on curvature-based features to cluster suspicious colon surface regions into polyp candidates. The thresholds were previously chosen experimentally by using feature histograms. The chosen thresholds were effective for detecting polyps sized 10 mm or larger in diameter. However, many medium-sized polyps, 6-9 mm in diameter, were missed in the initial detection procedure. In this paper, the task of finding optimal thresholds as a multiobjective optimization problem was formulated, and a genetic algorithm to solve it was utilized by evolving the Pareto front of the Pareto optimal set. The new CTC CAD system was tested on 792 patients. The sensitivities of the optimized system improved significantly, from 61.68% to 74.71% with an increase of 13.03% (95% CI [6.57%, 19.5%], p = 7.78 x 10(-5)) for the size category of 6-9 mm polyps, from 65.02% to 77.4% with an increase of 12.38% (95% CI [6.23%, 18.53%], p = 7.95 x 10(-5)) for polyps 6 mm or larger, and from 82.2% to 90.58% with an increase of 8.38% (95% CI [0.75%, 16%], p = 0.03) for polyps 8 mm or larger at comparable false positive rates. The sensitivities of the optimized system are nearly equivalent to those of expert radiologists."

CD011126,0,25509981,0,Retention of fetal bones 8 years following termination of pregnancy.,"Foreign bodies; in particular, fetal bones may present with a variety of clinical symptoms and signs including infertility, vaginal discharge, disparonia, pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding. Many case reports were described post- abortal removal of retained fetal bone at varying time intervals from the previous (D&E), ranging from weeks to years. In our case, a 34-year-old woman presented with abnormal uterine bleeding and secondary infertility, her only pregnancy being a termination 8 years previously at 15 weeks' gestation. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized, normal-shaped uterus with an echogenic scarred endometrium. After then office hysterescopy revealed fragments of the immature bone. All the immature bones were removed by operative hysterescopy. Significant numbers of patients may have endometrial pathology; the differential diagnosis of such unusual findings on ultrasound examination includes intrauterine contraceptive devices, foreign bodies, calcified submucous fibroids and Asherman's syndrome, as well as rarities such as heterotopic bone. The presence of this pathology may be a causal or contributory factor to subfertilty, and will remain undetected if the endometrium is not routinely evaluated. Indeed, these cases highlight the advantage of performing a hysteroscopy at the same time as the more invasive laparoscopy and dye insufflation, in selected cases."

The ultimate aim and purpose of this study was to establish ultrasound methods, standards and protocols for determining the volume of any gynecologic organ or tumor. The study included 31 women in reproductive age and postmenopause. All patients were examined with a RIC 5-9 3D-endovaginal probe (4.3-7.5 MHz) on a Voluson 730 Pro ultrasound device. The volume of myomas was measured by using the existing 2D and 3D ultrasound methods on the above mentioned device. All patients underwent myomectomy or hysterectomy due to clinically and ultrasonographically diagnosed uterine myomas indicating operative intervention. After the operation, the pathologist determined the volume of removed myomas by measuring them in a gauge bowl containing water, i.e. using Archimedes' principle (lift), serving as the control group with histopathologic diagnosis. A total of 155 myoma volumes were processed on 2D display, 31 myoma volumes were preoperatively measured on 3D display and 31 myoma volumes were measured by the pathologist. The values of US measurements for each US method were expressed as mean value of all measurements of myoma volumes. Statistical processing of the results and Student's t-test for independent samples revealed that the 2nd examined US method (measuring of myoma by using an ellipse and the longer tumor diameter) and 4th examined US method (measuring of myoma by using the longer and shorter tumor diameters together with establishing their mean values) in 2D US technique, as well as the 6th examined US method in 3D US technique showed no significant measurement differences in comparison with control measurement in a gauge bowl containing water (p < 0.05), indicating acceptability of the US methods for verifying tumor volumes. The standard error in determining the volume of myomas by the above US methods varied between 15% and 25%, so it is concluded that these three methods can be used in clinical practice to determine tumor volumes, in this case uterine myomas. The 3D MultiPlane method proved to be the most reliable method of determining the volume of uterine myomas."
CD011126,0,15467530,0,A practical approach to the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome.,"The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is primarily achieved through clinical history and physical findings. The principle features are hirsutism or biochemical evidence of excess androgen production and irregular menstrual bleeding caused by the chronic anovulation. Associated findings include insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia and obesity. Ultrasound imaging of the ovary has facilitated the diagnosis. It is important to exclude conditions that may mimic PCOS, such as hyperthecosis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, Cushing's syndrome, and androgen-producing neoplasms. These disorders are usually revealed by appropriate laboratory assessment. Screening tests include measurement of serum total testosterone, DHEA sulfate, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. In addition, in the obese individual, determinations of glucose and insulin levels, as well as a lipid profile, are highly recommended."

CD011126,0,20100052,0,Optimisation-based thermal treatment planning for catheter-based ultrasound hyperthermia.,"A patient-specific optimisation-based hyperthermia treatment planning program for catheter-based ultrasound technology was developed for a priori evaluation of proposed applicator implant strategies and determination of initial applied power settings. The interstitial and endocavity heating applicators, designed for delivering 3-D controllable hyperthermia within High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy implants, consist of linear and sectored arrays of ultrasound transducers with variable power control in both length and angle. A 3D biothermal model, which incorporates relevant anatomical structures and implant geometries based upon HDR treatment planning, has been developed to simulate the temperature distributions induced by these ultrasound applicators within the catheter implants. A temperature-based constrained optimisation algorithm was devised and integrated within the finite-element thermal solver to determine the optimal applied power levels. A temperature-expressed objective function and constraints were employed to limit maximum temperature (T(max)), maximise target coverage (T(target)), and minimise thermal exposure to normal tissue and surrounding organs. The optimisation-based treatment planning was applied on representative examples of clinical HDR implants for endocavity treatment of cervix (n = 3) and interstitial treatment of prostate (n = 3). Applicator positioning and orientation, T(max), and T(target), were varied, and temperature volume and thermal dose volume histograms calculated for each plan. The optimisation approach provided optimal applied power levels (4-24 independent transducer sections) leading to conforming or tailored temperature distributions for all cases, as indicated with improved temperature index T(90) in the target volume and negligible temperature and thermal dose (t(43,max) < 1 min) exposure in surrounding non-targeted tissues, such as bladder and rectum. The precision of the optimised power estimates was shown to be within <5% for a range of starting levels and were similarly convergent. The execution times of this optimisation (<16 min) and forward thermal treatment planning (<22 min) is sufficiently fast to be integrated into the clinical setting. This optimisation-based treatment planning platform for catheter-based ultrasound applicators is a useful tool to provide feedback for applicator selection (sector angle, number of transducer sections along length), positioning (angle or orientation), optimal initial power settings, and has potential to significantly improve the delivery of hyperthermia in conjunction with HDR brachytherapy."

In the conventional technique, we used posterioanterior (PA) instead of an anterioposterior (AP) projection normally used according to the international literature. All information concerning exposure conditions for each patient, were recorded. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were attached on the skin of each patient over the ovaries. In conventional HSGs, average values were for Dose Area Product (DAP) 0.41 Gycm(2), for Effective Dose (E) 0.15 mSv and for Ovarian Dose (OD) 0.24 mGy. In 3D-HSGs, they were 14.4 Gycm(2), 2.29 mSv and 3.96 mGy correspondingly. Patient doses in 3D-HSGs are of the same order of magnitude with those reported in the literature for conventional technique. However, they are larger compared to the conventional HSG performed with the technique we use in this specific X-ray system. E and OD are much lower with our technique where PA projection and the specific C-arm system are used in comparison with the corresponding values published in the literature for the conventional technique where the AP projection is used."

Mature oocytes were collected from regularly cycling, female cynomolgus monkeys subjected to ovarian superovulation using recombinant human FSH and hCG. Oocytes fertilized in vitro were cultured to the 4- to 8-cell stage, slow-cooled, and stored in liquid nitrogen before thawing and embryo transfer. Regularly cycling recipients were administered recombinant human relaxin or vehicle for 21 days through the peri-implantation period (Day 0 = pump implantation), during which time the thawed embryos were transferred (Day 7). Endometrial thickness and the number of gestational sacs were monitored by ultrasound at three time points (Days 7, 21, and 28). The number of days of placental sign (implantation bleeding) in pregnant females and menses in nonpregnant females were also recorded. Implantation (gestational sacs/embryo transferred) and multiple pregnancy (multiple gestations/ pregnant recipient) rates were slightly higher in relaxin-treated recipients compared to vehicle-treated recipients. Administration of relaxin was associated with increased implantation bleeding in pregnant females. Endometrial thickness was increased in relaxin-treated recipients at Days 7 and 28 compared to Day 0, but these differences were not observed at the same time points in vehicle-treated females. Systemic administration of recombinant human relaxin in an in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer setting was associated with effects consistent with a role for this hormone in endometrial physiology in primates."
CD011126,0,20095264,0,Development of prototype shielded cervical intracavitary brachytherapy applicators compatible with CT and MR imaging.,"Intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) is an integral part of the treatment regimen for cervical cancer and, generally, outcome in terms of local disease control and complications is a function of dose to the disease bed and critical structures, respectively. Therefore, it is paramount to accurately determine the dose given via ICBT to the tumor bed as well as critical structures. This is greatly facilitated through the use of advanced three-dimensional imaging modalities, such as CT and MR, to delineate critical and target structures with an ICBT applicator inserted in vivo. These methods are not possible when using a shielded applicator due to the image artifacts generated by interovoid shielding. The authors present two prototype shielded ICBT applicators that can be utilized for artifact-free CT image acquisition. They also investigate the MR amenability and dosimetry of a novel tungsten-alloy shielding material to extend the functionality of these devices."

She developed hydronephrosis as a result of retroperitoneal lymphocele after total abdominal hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer. Laparoscopic marsupialization under transvaginal ultrasonographic guidance was chosen because conservative therapy including percutaneous or transvaginal drainage ran the risk of bowel perforation.

CD011126,0,18602053,0,Ovarian remnant syndrome at the port site.,"Ovarian remnant syndrome is a rare gynecologic complication, mostly induced by difficult salpingo-oophorectomy with the residual ovarian tissue on the pelvic side wall. This is a report of a rare case of ovarian remnant syndrome at a port site after laparoscopic oophorectomy and a review of the related literature. A 22-year-old virgin had a laparoscopic oophorectomy for an endometrioma 5 years earlier. Postoperatively, she visited gynecologic clinics for a frequent painful sensation at the left port site. After sonographic examination and under the impression of a recurrent endometrioma, laparotomy and cyst excision were performed. Surprisingly, ectopic ovary was diagnosed by the pathologist. Review of the literature revealed ovarian remnant implantation at a port site as a very rare type of ovarian remnant syndrome. During laparoscopic oophorectomy in a woman without sexual exposure who is not a good candidate for culdotomy, the removal of the excised ovary through the port site is sometimes difficult and residual ovarian tissue implantation may occur. There are many methods to reduce the risk of port-site seeding, which we must keep in mind and execute to prevent such a complication."

In the tamoxifen-treated patients 14 (8.0%) developed endometrial polyps. Of 14 patients, 8 (57.2%) each displayed atrophic endometrium in the same histologic specimen, 5 (35.7%) each had coexisting simple hyperplasia, and 1 (7.1%) other had complex hyperplasia. Another 21 (12.0%) developed simple or complex hyperplasia. The endometrial hyperplasia coexisted with atrophic endometrium in all these patients. All these lesions were selectively identified by hysteroscopic examination prior to the endometrial biopsy. In the control group 3 (11.0%) had simple hyperplasia and 2 (7.4%) had endometrial polyps. The above results support the hypothesis that the endometrium of postmenopausal breast cancer patients on tamoxifen treatment may possess different responses to tamoxifen exposure."

CD011126,0,15984679,0,Focal beam distortion and treatment planning in abdominal focused ultrasound surgery.,"Recent clinical trials show promising results in using MRI and MRI-based thermometry to guide focused ultrasound surgery to treat uterine fibroids. During treatment, large variation in the focal temperature distribution has been observed. It is possible that some of this variation is due to abdominal tissue inhomogeneity, which might be causing focal beam distortion, and might largely decrease the focusing ability in deep-seated tissues. The purpose of this study was to numerically demonstrate this effect and also show the feasibility of restoring the focal beam patterns by employing the phase correction procedure for phased arrays. Abdominal MR data from four uterine fibroid patients were obtained to reconstruct the three-dimensional meshes of interfaces used in simulations, and one patient was selected to perform the analysis of key parameters in focused ultrasound surgery. Results show that, without phase correction, the focused beam can be severely distorted while using a frequency above 1 MHz or delivering ring-shape focal patterns. Different focal positions at the same depth may require a different power to induce the same ultrasonic intensity level (up to 179% among the different focal patterns). After adding a phase correction procedure, the distorted focal beams can be restored, and the peak intensity can be largely recovered (up to 85% among the different focal patterns). This study may offer important implications and information for treatment planning toward optimizing focused ultrasound surgery in uterine fibroid or other abdominal tumor treatments."

An isolated cyst in the pelvic cavity is considered as primary only when there are no other hydatid cysts. Herein, we report an isolated pelvic-cervical hydatid cyst which presented without any involvement of the other abdominal organs or lungs. Our patient, a 27-year-old woman with the primary complaints of dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain, had thin-walled large cystic mass originating from the cervix, diagnosed by ultrasonography. She underwent surgery with the most likely initial diagnosis of exophytic fibroid with cystic degeneration.

CD011126,0,18383691,0,Mixture of expert 3D massive-training ANNs for reduction of multiple types of false positives in CAD for detection of polyps in CT colonography.,"One of the major challenges in computer-aided detection (CAD) of polyps in CT colonography (CTC) is the reduction of false-positive detections (FPs) without a concomitant reduction in sensitivity. A large number of FPs is likely to confound the radiologist's task of image interpretation, lower the radiologist's efficiency, and cause radiologists to lose their confidence in CAD as a useful tool. Major sources of FPs generated by CAD schemes include haustral folds, residual stool, rectal tubes, the ileocecal valve, and extra-colonic structures such as the small bowel and stomach. Our purpose in this study was to develop a method for the removal of various types of FPs in CAD of polyps while maintaining a high sensitivity. To achieve this, we developed a ""mixture of expert"" three-dimensional (3D) massive-training artificial neural networks (MTANNs) consisting of four 3D MTANNs that were designed to differentiate between polyps and four categories of FPs: (1) rectal tubes, (2) stool with bubbles, (3) colonic walls with haustral folds, and (4) solid stool. Each expert 3D MTANN was trained with examples from a specific non-polyp category along with typical polyps. The four expert 3D MTANNs were combined with a mixing artificial neural network (ANN) such that different types of FPs could be removed. Our database consisted of 146 CTC datasets obtained from 73 patients whose colons were prepared by standard pre-colonoscopy cleansing. Each patient was scanned in both supine and prone positions. Radiologists established the locations of polyps through the use of optical-colonoscopy reports. Fifteen patients had 28 polyps, 15 of which were 5-9 mm and 13 were 10-25 mm in size. The CTC cases were subjected to our previously reported CAD method consisting of centerline-based extraction of the colon, shape-based detection of polyp candidates, and a Bayesian-ANN-based classification of polyps. The original CAD method yielded 96.4% (27/28) by-polyp sensitivity with an average of 3.1 (224/73) FPs per patient. The mixture of expert 3D MTANNs removed 63% (142/224) of the FPs without the loss of any true positive; thus, the FP rate of our CAD scheme was improved to 1.1 (82/73) FPs per patient while the original sensitivity was maintained. By use of the mixture of expert 3D MTANNs, the specificity of a CAD scheme for detection of polyps in CTC was substantially improved while a high sensitivity was maintained."

The diagnosis of cervical incompetence is mostly based on the measurement of the shortened cervical length from transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) images. We investigated the cervical dynamic response to spontaneous or imposed variations of intrauterine pressure, which may induce cervical shortening. The TVUS images of the cervix sagittal cross-sections were recorded from six women in mid pregnancy. The cervical dynamics was observed while the subject was either in a supine position, kneeling, or had undergone transfundal pressure in a supine position. Each subject was tested in all three positions, but the dynamic response was observed in only one of them. The time-dependent analysis was performed on consecutive TVUS images at time intervals of 1 s to extract the dynamic response of the funneling geometry and the closed cervical length. The internal os was considered as being a point on the uterine wall and characterized by a sharp gradient of the inner wall of the uterine cavity. Dynamic evaluation of TVUS images revealed that shortening of the cervical length was greater than 30% and that the funneling percentage was greater than 40%.

Positron emission tomography is not discussed. Imaging in infertility, in the diagnosis of Mullerian duct anomalies and in gynecological oncology (staging of gynecological cancers, diagnosis of recurrence of gynecological cancer, diagnosis of trophoblastic tumors) is not dealt with. Ultrasound is the first-line imaging method for discrimination between viable intrauterine pregnancy, miscarriage and tubal pregnancy in women with bleeding and/or pain in early pregnancy, for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses and for making a specific diagnosis in adnexal tumors (e.g. dermoid cyst, endometrioma, hemorrhagic corpus luteum, etc.), for diagnosing intracavitary uterine pathology in women with bleeding problems, and for confirming or refuting pelvic pathology in women with pelvic pain. Magnetic resonance imaging can have a role as a secondary test in the diagnosis of adenomyosis, 'deep endometriosis' (e.g. endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum or in the uterosacral ligaments), and in the diagnosis of extremely rare types of ectopic pregnancy (e.g. in the spleen, liver or retroperitoneum)."

Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) displays of the CT data are employed, both of which are critical for proper evaluation. Although many radiologists continue to use the 2D images for polyp detection, more emphasis on the 3D images for primary detection of polyps has yielded the best results for screening detection. The primary target lesion for colorectal screening is the adenomatous polyp, since detection and removal of all larger or advanced lesions could potentially prevent approximately 95% or more of all colon cancers. Frankly invasive adenocarcinoma is rarely encountered in an average-risk asymptomatic screening population, but it is of course another important target. In addition to these clinically significant epithelial neoplasms, however, a host of additional lesions and pseudolesions may be encountered that appear polypoid at CT colonography. A subset of ""don't touch"" lesions, which should not be confused with potential neoplasms, can also be recognized at CT colonography. A variety of useful techniques and observations can be used to increase the specificity of CT colonography for distinguishing false polyps from true polyps."

The incidence of symptoms and their resolution after hysteroscopic surgery were evaluated prospectively in 120 consecutive isthmocele patients. Patients included only symptomatic premenopausal women. Transvaginal ultrasound and office hysteroscopy were used to diagnose isthmocele. Operative hysteroscopy was performed to correct the cesarean scar defect, and histologic findings were evaluated. Correction of an isthmocele via operative hysteroscopy was successful in all cases evaluated. Isthmoplasty resulted in the resolution of postmenstrual abnormal uterine bleeding and suprapubic pelvic pain in 80% of patients. In the remaining cases, 7% of patients had an improvement of symptoms, whereas 13% did not obtain any relief. Considering the recent diagnostic recognition of isthmoceles, we conclude that surgical treatment of this pathology by operative hysteroscopy may represent the best choice in symptomatic women because of its minimal invasiveness and beneficial therapeutic results."

CD011126,0,21657996,0,Possibilities and limits of ovarian reserve testing in ART.,"Markers of ovarian reserve are associated with ovarian aging as they decline with chronologic age, and hence may predict stages of reproductive aging including the menopause transition. Assessment of ovarian reserve include measurement of serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), anti-M�llerian hormone (AMH), and inhibin-B. Ultrasound determination of antral follicle count (AFC), ovarian vascularity and ovarian volume also can have a role. The clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT), exogenous FSH ovarian reserve test (EFORT), and GnRH-agonist stimulation test (GAST) are dynamic methods that have been used in the past to assess ovarian reserve. In infertile women, ovarian reserve markers can be used to predict low and high oocyte yield and treatment failure in women undergoing in vitro fertilization. However the markers may have limitations when an in depth analysis of their accuracy, cost, convenience, and utility is performed. As ovarian reserve markers may permit the identification of both the extremes of ovarian stimulation, a possible role for their measurement may be in the individualization of treatment strategies in order to reduce the clinical risk of ART along with optimized treatment burden. It is fundamental to clarify the cost/benefit of its use in the ovarian reserve testing before initiation of an IVF cycle and whether the ovarian reserve markers-determined strategy of ovarian stimulation for assisted conception may be associated to improved live birth rate."

The role of irradiation is crucial to ensure a better local control. It has been shown that the more the delivered dose is important, the better the local results are. In order to preserve the maximum of organs at risk and to allow this dose escalation, brachytherapy (intracavitary and/or interstitial) has been progressively introduced. Its evolution and its progressive improvement have led to the development of high dose rate brachytherapy, the advantages of which are especially based on the possibility of outpatient treatment while maintaining the effectiveness of other brachytherapy forms (i.e., low dose rate or pulsed dose rate). Numerous innovations have also been completed in the field of imaging, leading to a progress in treatment planning systems by switching from two-dimensional form to a three-dimensional one. Image-guided brachytherapy allows more precise target volume delineation as well as an optimized dosimetry permitting a better coverage of target volumes."

CD011126,0,15927511,0,[Ovarian endometrioma and infertility: when not to treat?].,"Ovarian endometrioma is not infrequently encountered in infertile patients. Its etiopathogeny, its relations with attributed symptoms and the recommanded treatment to apply, are still debated. Various therapeutic tools are available, such as abstention, ultrasonographically guided aspiration and drainage, and surgery. Each option carries specific advantages and disadvantages. Ultrasonographically guided aspiration bears infectious risks. Among various proposed surgical procedures, cystectomy appears to offer the best performances. Results of IVF are slightly or not altered, neither by an ovarian endometrioma, nor by previous surgery, except in case of iterative surgery or if operated lesions were very severe. Laparoscopic surgery is still the first line treatment in many cases. Abstention can be applied in particular circumstances. Ultrasonographically guided aspiration needs to be further evaluated."
CD011126,0,1388132,0,Pelviscopic treatment of ovarian cysts in premenopausal women.,"Between 1984 and 1989, 773 patients less than or equal to 45 years of age, presenting with a total of 809 ovarian cysts, underwent pelviscopy at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Kiel University. In 36 cases, cysts were bilateral. 678 cysts (84%) were treated by pelviscopy alone. Organ-preserving treatment was performed in 83%, oophorectomy or adnexectomy in only 17% of cases. Two stage Ia ovarian carcinomas (0.26% of all cysts) were operated on by pelviscopy before laparotomy. Sonography is particularly important in determining whether a pelviscopic approach is appropriate. Pelviscopic procedures are unacceptable in multilocular cysts measuring greater than or equal to 7 cm in diameter with echo-dense components. Special caution is required for any cyst measuring greater than 9 cm in diameter. The risk of opening a malignant cyst must be weighed against the advantages of pelviscopic surgery: minimal physical strain, better postoperative quality of life, and organ conservation. In doubtful cases, laparotomy is recommended."
CD011126,0,16242938,0,Observing three-dimensional human microvascular and myogenic architecture using conventional fluorescence microscopy.,"Microangiography and vascular casting have previously been used to demonstrate the three-dimensional architecture of human uterine microvasculature. However, a limitation of these perfusion-dependent techniques is the difficulty in identifying surrounding tissue components. We have previously shown that it is possible to visualise microvascular networks on the cut surfaces of fresh tissue specimens by diffusive labelling of vascular endothelium with fluorescently conjugated UEA-1 lectin. Unlike perfusion methods that are limited to accessible vascular networks, diffusive fluorescence labelling (DFL) allows additional visualisation of extravascular cellular components, such as smooth muscle. Following UEA-1 DFL, smooth muscle-myosin and -actin were then visualised by immunolocalisation on the acetone-fixed tissue pieces. This allowed clear three-dimensional distinction between the vascular and muscle architecture of the myometrium and endometrium. This method can also be applied for studying the relative distribution of microvascular and muscle architecture in leiomyomas (fibroids). The techniques described in this methodological study provide a simple way of directly examining the uterine vasculature in three dimensions using conventional microscopy, while also distinguishing myometrial from endometrial parts of the network."

CD011126,0,22417666,0,No clinical relevance of the height of fundal indentation in subseptate or arcuate uterus: a prospective study.,"The American Fertility Society has classified the arcuate uterus as a minor malformation with a benign clinical behaviour. The aim of this prospective study was to verify whether there is any scientific basis for this differentiation. Patients with at least one early miscarriage and a subseptate or arcuate uterus were admitted for hysteroscopic metroplasty. Patients were allocated to a subseptate uterus group, with an indentation of 1.5 cm or more, or an arcuate uterus group, with a smaller indentation. The miscarriage rates after metroplasty were similar between the two groups (14.0% in the subseptate uterus group versus 11.1% in the arcuate uterus group). Before metroplasty, the miscarriage rates were significantly higher in subseptate uterus group, as well as in the arcuate uterus group (both P<0.001). According to these results, there is no evidence to support that the arcuate uterus has a different effect on the reproductive outcome in comparison to the subseptate uterus, neither before nor after surgical correction of the anomaly. Since there is no scientific basis for a separate classification of the arcuate uterus, a review of the classifications of uterine congenital anomalies should be considered as necessary. Congenital uterine malformations have been classified by the American Fertility Society (AFS) since 1988. Although the AFS classification received wide acceptance and is still the most broadly used system, it is associated with various limitations in effective categorization of the anomalies. It is interesting that, until now, none of the other available options have been able to effectively replace the AFS system. Numerous papers indicate septate or subseptate (partial septate) uterus (AFS class V) is a possible cause of an unfavourable pregnancy outcome. Arcuate uterus (AFS class VI), a slight malformation similar to septate uterus, should differ from septate or subseptate uterus, because this 'minor' malformation should behave benignly with respect to the septate uterus. The aim of this study was to scientifically validate the difference between the arcuate and subseptate uterus in their effect on reproductive outcome through the results of a metroplasty in both groups of patients. A group of 96 patients, who underwent metroplasty after at least one early miscarriage, was divided into two groups according to the severity of the congenital uterine malformation. Our results indicate that there are no differences in pregnancy outcome after metroplasty either in patients with septate or arcuate utera. The poor pregnancy outcome in women with septate uterus seems not to be correlated to the dimension of the septum itself. There are no scientific bases for a separate classification of the arcuate uterus and it is proposed that a review of the classification of uterine congenital anomalies is necessary."

CD011126,0,19268619,0,[Management of the first trimester miscarriages].,"A first trimester miscarriage is most often painfully experienced by the patients. The practitioner should be able to offer appropriate, timely, efficient and safe medical management, allowing a shorter convalescence without effect on subsequent fertility. Each step of the process of the miscarriage results in clinical and ultrasonographic characteristics, and requires a specific therapeutic strategy. Vaginal ultrasound allows confirmation of early pregnancy failure (missed miscarriage) diagnosis and to estimate the complete or incomplete removal of trophoblastic material. However, the endometrial thickness does not appear to be predictive for the risk of persistent bleeding or secondary surgery. Surgical evacuation of the product of conception remains the most effective and the quickest method of treatment. Depending on the clinical situation, medical treatment with misoprostol (missed miscarriage) or expectative attitude (incomplete miscarriage) do not increase the risk of complications, particularly the infectious one. However, these alternatives generally require more prolonged outpatient follow-up leading to more frequent consultations and surgical emergencies."

We undertook a study to find out what proportions of polyps are malignant or pre-malignant, and of those, what proportion could be identified on outpatient endometrial sampling. A consecutive series of 102 women were identified from theatre records and a cancer registry. The results suggest that about 10% of women with benign polyps get a further lesion. Overall, 11 (10.8%) had cancer and two (1.9%) had severe pre-malignant changes (complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia).

However, how the translational machinery is organized spatially in native cellular environments is not yet well understood. Here we have mapped individual ribosomes in electron tomograms of intact human cells by template matching and determined the average structure of the ribosome in situ. Characteristic features of active ribosomes in the cellular environment were assigned to the tRNA channel, elongation factors, and additional densities near the peptide tunnel. Importantly, the relative spatial configuration of neighboring ribosomes in the cell is clearly nonrandom. The preferred configurations are specific for active polysomes and were largely abrogated in puromycin-treated control cells. The distinct neighbor orientations found in situ resemble configurations of bacterial polysomes in vitro, indicating a conserved supramolecular organization with implications for nascent polypeptide folding."

Two sets of CT scans were obtained for ten patients to evaluate the effect of bladder distention. After the first CT scan, with an empty bladder, a second set of CT scans was obtained with the bladder filled. The clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, rectum, and small bowel were delineated on each image set. The AICBT and 3D-ICBT plans were generated, and we compared the different planning techniques with respect to the dose characteristics of CTV and organs at risk. As a result of bladder distention, the mean dose (D50) was decreased significantly and geometrical variations were observed in the bladder and small bowel, with acceptable minor changes in the CTV and rectum. The average D2 cm(3)and D1 cm(3)showed a significant change in the bladder and small bowel with AICBT; however, no change was detected with the 3D-ICBT planning. No significant dose change in the CTV or rectum was observed with either the AICBT or the 3D-ICBT plan.

However, no widely accepted model of the fiber architecture of the myometrium could be acquired. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the uterus by magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a 3D macroscopic approach. Ex vivo MR DTI measurements were performed on five uteri from nonpregnant patients. The main diffusion directions reflecting the orientation of directional structures in the examined tissues were determined from diffusion-weighted spin-echo measurements. A fiber tracking algorithm was used to extrapolate the fiber architecture. The method was validated against histological slides and indirectly through the analysis of leiomyomas, which exhibit less anisotropy than normal myometrium. Significant anisotropy was found in most regions of all examined nonpregnant human uteri. But only two systems of fibers were found running circularly along the intramural part of the uterine tubes. They merged caudally and built a close fitting envelope of circular layers around the uterine cavity. On the cervix, circular fibers were observed in the outer part as well as mostly longitudinal fibers in the inner part. These results confirm the existence of directional structures in the complex fiber architecture of the human uterus. They also indicate that MR DTI is a beneficial and complementary tool to standard microscopic techniques to determine the intrinsic fiber architecture in human organs."

The current study was performed to introduce the classical (C(C)) and discrete compactness (C(D)) as new morphometric parameters for quantification of this pattern. A retrospective analysis of 76 surgically treated patients with cervical carcinoma was conducted and the pattern of invasion was qualitatively classified as closed, finger-like or diffuse, respectively, by two pathologists. After digitization of the histological slides with a field of view of 10.4 mm x 8.3mm, tumor areas were labeled and C(C) and C(D) were computed based on the drawings (binary images). Additionally, intraindividual variation of compactness was evaluated for 12 selected tumors. The qualitative pattern assessment by the pathologists was moderately reproducible with an interobserver agreement of 72% and a kappa coefficient of 0.44. The values of C(C) and C(D) referring to the invasion front patterns assigned by both pathologists were significantly different between the three classified groups (p< or =0.01 and p< or =0.0001), so that, both theoretically and in practice, compactness regards the same morphological feature. In due consideration of the analysis of the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves and the variation coefficient of different tumor regions, C(D) is more suitable for practical use than C(C). Tumors with a microscopic invasion into the parametria and with lymph-vascular space invasion were found to have a lower value of C(D), which indicates a more diffuse pattern of invasion (p=0.028 and p=0.033). We conclude that the discrete compactness C(D) is a new and reproducible parameter for a computer assisted quantification of the invasion front pattern and, thus, defines a further phenotypic feature of SCC of the uterine cervix."

CD011126,0,15157643,0,Diagnosis of endometriosis: pelvic endoscopy and imaging techniques.,"Although laparoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, the need for this invasive diagnostic tool is a major stumbling-block in both effective clinical management and for research into this common and debilitating disease. As visual inspection of the pelvis has also major limitations, particularly for the diagnosis of posterior pelvis, bowel and bladder endometriosis, it is not surprising that considerable efforts are being made to improve the diagnosis by imaging techniques. Peritoneal endometriosis and ovarian endometriomata are predominantly haemorrhagic lesions. During laparoscopy, these lesions are readily identified by the presence of old or recent bleeding. Both transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have a low sensitivity for the diagnosis of peritoneal and ovarian implants and adhesions. Transvaginal sonography is useful in the diagnosis of ovarian endometriomata, providing the diameter is larger than 2 cm. As transvaginal sonography costs less than MR imaging, transvaginal sonography might be the preferred method of confirming a sizeable endometrioma. Posterior pelvis endometriosis is an infiltrating adenomyotic lesion with microendometriomata. High-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography, and in particular MR imaging, are increasingly used to diagnose the presence and extent of infiltrating lesions and the involvement of rectosigmoid and ureters."

CD011126,0,21636174,0,[Granular cell tumor of the esophagus: description of an infrequent benign tumor].,"Granular cell tumors (GCT) are infrequent tumors first described by Abrikossoff in 1926. Gastrointestinal involvement occurs in about 6% of GCT, the esophagus being the most frequent location. These tumors are usually benign and asymptomatic and are usually found incidentally when an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is carried out for another reason, showing an isolated polyp or sessile submucosal nodule, covered by intact yellowish mucosa and with firm consistency. Endoscopic ultrasonography has significantly improved the diagnosis of these lesions. Nowadays endoscopic mucosectomy is the treatment of choice of esophageal GCT with a low frequency of complications. Histologic analysis of the surgical specimen shows specific characteristics such as positivity for S-100 protein. We present two new cases of esophageal GCT that were diagnosed recently and discuss the most relevant features of this infrequent disease."

Exposure to hormonally active chemicals may play an etiologic role. The authors investigated the risk of uterine leiomyoma associated with exposure to 2,3,7,8,-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) for women who resided near Seveso, Italy, in 1976 at the time of a chemical explosion. Twenty years later, women enrolled in the Seveso Women's Health Study were asked about history of fibroids, medical records were obtained, and vaginal ultrasonography was performed for a subset. Serum collected soon after the explosion was analyzed for TCDD. A likelihood-based method that combines both historical and current status (ultrasound) data was adapted to estimate the hazard ratio. Of 956 eligible women, 251 (26.3%) had fibroids. Compared with that for women with TCDD levels of < or = 20 parts per trillion, the age-adjusted hazard ratios were 0.58 (95% confidence interval: 0.41, 0.81) for women with levels of 20.1-75.0 parts per trillion and 0.62 (95% confidence interval: 0.44, 0.89) for women with levels of >75.0 parts per trillion. This finding suggests that TCDD may have antiestrogenic effects in the uterine myometrium, in contrast to apparently estrogenic effects previously found in the breast of Seveso Women's Health Study women."

CD011126,0,19909600,0,How common is polycystic ovary syndrome in recurrent miscarriage?,"The association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and recurrent miscarriage (RM) has been long established, but the relative importance of this condition as a cause of RM is far from clear. Previous studies on the prevalence of PCOS in RM have been hampered by a lack of objective and universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS, resulting in considerable controversy. However, the Rotterdam criteria have since been accepted as the gold standard for diagnosis of PCOS, and therefore these criteria have been used to produce a much clearer and more objective assessment of the prevalence of PCOS in RM. Three hundred women with recurrent miscarriage were studied. A diagnosis of PCOS was established via measurement of cycle length and day 21 serum progesterone, determination of the free androgen index and pelvic ultrasonography. All ultrasound reports prior to publication of the Rotterdam criteria were reviewed, ensuring consistency in the diagnosis of a polycystic ovary. Ultrasound scans of 27 patients confirmed polycystic ovaries with a further 10 scans suggestive of polycystic ovaries, but with insufficient information for the Rotterdam criteria to be applied. Hence, 27-37 (9.0-12%) patients presented with ultrasonographic polycystic ovaries. Using the Rotterdam criteria, 25-30 (8.3-10%) patients had PCOS. It is concluded that the prevalence of PCOS in RM is considerably lower than has previously been accepted."

CD011126,0,21720472,0,Resection of left ventricular fibroma with subacute papillary muscle rupture.,"Cardiac fibroma is a rare, benign tumor that occurs chiefly in children and rarely in adults. Most fibromas occur in the ventricles and may reach a very large size that complicates surgical removal. Herein, we report the case of a 38-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath, fatigue, and lightheadedness and was found to have a 6 × 8-cm fibroma of the left ventricle. Surgical resection was successful, but 7 days later she developed sudden-onset severe mitral regurgitation due to partial disruption of the posterolateral papillary muscle. Mitral valve replacement with a 27-mm mechanical valve was performed. Five years later, the patient remained well, without evident tumor recurrence or cardiac dysfunction.Mitral valve dysfunction with regurgitation has been reported to occur before, immediately after, and late after the resection of left ventricular fibromas. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of subacute papillary muscle rupture after the resection of a left ventricular fibroma. This case highlights the need to evaluate mitral valve function by carefully inspecting the resection margins after surgery and interpreting the echocardiographic results during the acute, subacute, and late time frames."

CD011126,0,24153188,0,Structure of the SecY channel during initiation of protein translocation.,"Many secretory proteins are targeted by signal sequences to a protein-conducting channel, formed by prokaryotic SecY or eukaryotic Sec61 complexes, and are translocated across the membrane during their synthesis. Crystal structures of the inactive channel show that the SecY subunit of the heterotrimeric complex consists of two halves that form an hourglass-shaped pore with a constriction in the middle of the membrane and a lateral gate that faces the lipid phase. The closed channel has an empty cytoplasmic funnel and an extracellular funnel that is filled with a small helical domain, called the plug. During initiation of translocation, a ribosome-nascent chain complex binds to the SecY (or Sec61) complex, resulting in insertion of the nascent chain. However, the mechanism of channel opening during translocation is unclear. Here we have addressed this question by determining structures of inactive and active ribosome-channel complexes with cryo-electron microscopy. Non-translating ribosome-SecY channel complexes derived from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii or Escherichia coli show the channel in its closed state, and indicate that ribosome binding per se causes only minor changes. The structure of an active E. coli ribosome-channel complex demonstrates that the nascent chain opens the channel, causing mostly rigid body movements of the amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of SecY. In this early translocation intermediate, the polypeptide inserts as a loop into the SecY channel with the hydrophobic signal sequence intercalated into the open lateral gate. The nascent chain also forms a loop on the cytoplasmic surface of SecY rather than entering the channel directly."

CD011126,0,15201204,0,Effect of anatomy on human nasal air flow and odorant transport patterns: implications for olfaction.,"Recent studies that have compared CT or MRI images of an individual's nasal anatomy and measures of their olfactory sensitivity have found a correlation between specific anatomical areas and performance on olfactory assessments. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, we have developed a method to quickly (<few days) convert nasal CT scans from an individual patient into an anatomically accurate 3-D numerical nasal model that can be used to predict airflow and odorant transport, which may ultimately determine olfactory sensitivity. The 3-D model can be also be rapidly modified to depict various anatomical deviations, such as polyps and their removal, that may alter nasal airflow and impair olfactory ability. To evaluate the degree to which variations in critical nasal areas such as the olfactory slit and nasal valve can alter airflow and odorant transport, inspiratory and expiratory airflow with odorants were simulated using numerical finite volume methods. Results suggest that anatomical changes in the olfactory region (upper meatus below the cribriform plate) and the nasal valve region will strongly affect airflow patterns and odorant transport through the olfactory region, with subsequent effects on olfactory function. The ability to model odorant transport through individualized models of the nasal passages holds promise for relating anatomical deviations to generalized or selective disturbances in olfactory perception and may provide important guidance for treatments for nasal-sinus disease, occupational rhinitis and surgical interventions that seek to optimize airflow and improve deficient olfactory function."

In young girls, symptoms may be vague, with patients complaining of non-specific gastro-intestinal problems. Combination with other complications such as pyelonephritis makes the diagnosis of adnexal torsion even more difficult as in the present case. To preserve future reproductive function, early surgical intervention is required. Although the impact on menarchal development of oophorectomy or partial removal of ovarian tissue before menarche remains to be evaluated, timely recognition and treatment of adnexal torsion clearly increases the possibility of retaining the ovary. Therefore, to decrease the time between the onset of symptoms and the identification of patients at risk, sonography should be considered as a first imaging modality for evaluating children with any degree of abdominal pain accompanied by non-specific symptoms."

Based on these premises the aim of the present study was to investigate possible ultrasound SV changes in infertile patients with DM and diabetic neuropathy (DN), after prolonged administration of tadalafil (TAD) (a specific phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor). To accomplish this, 20 infertile patients with symptomatic DN and erectile dysfunction were selected and arbitrarily divided into two groups which were assigned to: daily administration of 5 mg TAD for 3 months (Group A) (n = 10) and administration of placebo (Group B) (n = 10). All patients underwent to scrotal and prostate-vesicular transrectal ultrasound evaluation and semen analysis (Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen, WHO, 2010) before and after treatment. The following SV US parameters were recorded: (i) body APD; (ii) fundus APD; (iii) parietal thickness of the right and left SVs; and (iv) number of polycyclic areas within both SVs. We then calculated the following parameters: (i) fundus/body (F/B) ratio; (ii) difference of the parietal thickness between the right and the left SV and (iii) pre- and post-ejaculatory APD difference. In addition, we also evaluated the SV ejection fraction. Group A patients showed a significant reduction in F/B ratio and higher pre- and post-ejaculatory body SV APD difference compared with baseline or Group B after 3 months. These patients showed also a significant increase in SV ejection fraction and a significant improvement of the total sperm count, progressive motility, seminal levels of fructose, leucocytes and ejaculate volume. In conclusion, these results suggest that infertile DM patients with DN and erectile dysfunction had an improvement of ultrasound features suggestive of diabetic neuropathy after daily treatment with low doses of TAD."

CD011126,0,18360989,0,[Ultrasound tissue modifications after polypropylene prosthesis apposition in inguinal hernia].,"Few studies have addressed the use of ultrasonography in the evaluation of abdominal hernia. In the present study ultrasonography was used to assess tissue modifications after apposition of a polypropylene prosthesis for inguinal hernia. Seventy-two patients submitted to calibrated inguinal hernioplasty (mesh and plugs) in local anaesthesia for inguinal hernia were studied by ultrasonography at 5 days, 1 and 3 months, and 1 year after the surgical intervention. The mesh presented as a small hyperechoic layer. In 50 patients (69.4%) a seroma was present above the mesh. The seroma was < 5 cc in 33 patients, between 5 and 10 cc in 6 patients, and > 10 cc in 11 patients. During the ultrasound examinations no recurrences were found and the mesh was not displaced. The seroma disappeared spontaneously between postoperative days 30 and 90 and was probably related to the size of the hernia and the number of plugs."

CD011126,0,12942842,0,[Efficiency of saline contrast hysterosonography for evaluating the uterine cavity].,"Diagnostic hysteroscopy is the standard investigation performed in the case of abnormal vaginal blood loss. More recently there has been increasing interest for minimal invasive saline contrast hysterosonography (SCHS) as this technique is less painful and less expensive. SCHS is indicated in case of abnormal uterine bleeding (premenopausal and postmenopausal), bleeding while using tamoxifen, suspicion of a congenital uterine abnormality and Asherman's syndrome. As well as intracavity abnormalities (polyps and myomas) SCHS can also be used to evaluate the intramural extension of myomas, which is necessary to assess whether hysteroscopic resection is possible. The sensitivity and specificity of SCHS for demonstrating intracavity abnormalities (with a prevalence of 54%) are 94% (95%-CI; 91-97) and 89% (95%-CI: 85-94) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values are 91% (95%-CI: 87-95) and 92% (95%-CI: 89-97) respectively. SCHS has a short learning curve and can be performed in an outpatient setting. SCHS fails more frequently in postmenopausal women than premenopausal women (12.5% vs. 4.7%; p = 0.03). The chance of a non-conclusive SCHS is 7.6% and is higher if the uterine volume is greater than 600 cm3 (relative risk: 2.63; 95%-CI: 1.05-6.60) and if two or more myomas are present: (RR 2.65; 95%-CI: 1.16-6.10). SCHS is 2 to 9 times cheaper than diagnostic hysteroscopy. It can replace 84% of the diagnostic hysteroscopies. SCHS, in combination with endometrial sampling, whenever indicated, might be able to replace diagnostic hysteroscopy as gold standard in the evaluation of the uterine cavity."
CD011126,0,8586311,0,Comparison between transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography for identifying endometrial malignancies.,"Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is generally considered superior to transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) in the estimation of endometrial abnormalities. A disadvantage of TVS is the limited field of view. The purpose of this study is a comparison between TAS and TVS for endometrial cancer screening. Ninety-one postmenopausal women were included. They were evaluated by TAS, TVS, and endometrial tissue sampling. The mean endometrial thickness estimated by TVS was larger than that obtained by TAS (p < 0.0001). Sensitivity and specificity of TAS were 83.3 and 58.8% and of TVS 100 and 54.1%, respectively. We conclude that TVS might be superior to TAS, especially in patients with a retroflexed uterus."
CD011126,0,24770909,0,Elastic shape analysis of cylindrical surfaces for 3D/2D registration in endometrial tissue characterization.,"We study the problem of joint registration and deformation analysis of endometrial tissue using 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 2D trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVUS) measurements. In addition to the different imaging techniques involved in the two modalities, this problem is complicated due to: 1) different patient pose during MRI and TVUS observations, 2) the 3D nature of MRI and 2D nature of TVUS measurements, 3) the unknown intersecting plane for TVUS in MRI volume, and 4) the potential deformation of endometrial tissue during TVUS measurement process. Focusing on the shape of the tissue, we use expert manual segmentation of its boundaries in the two modalities and apply, with modification, recent developments in shape analysis of parametric surfaces to this problem. First, we extend the 2D TVUS curves to generalized cylindrical surfaces through replication, and then we compare them with MRI surfaces using elastic shape analysis. This shape analysis provides a simultaneous registration (optimal reparameterization) and deformation (geodesic) between any two parametrized surfaces. Specifically, it provides optimal curves on MRI surfaces that match with the original TVUS curves. This framework results in an accurate quantification and localization of the deformable endometrial cells for radiologists, and growth characterization for gynecologists and obstetricians. We present experimental results using semi-synthetic data and real data from patients to illustrate these ideas."
CD011126,0,18504700,0,"Pelvic pain, adnexal masses, and ultrasound.","Pelvic pain, acute or chronic, accounts for more than 10% of referrals to gynecologists. Pain accounts for more than 40% of gynecologic diagnostic laparoscopies.

Ultrasound is useful in preoperative evaluation and in predicting surgical findings. This section reviews the use of various ultrasound modalities in evaluating adnexal masses and associated pelvic pain. Morphologic assessment with two-dimensional (2-D) ultrasound is the foundation for adnexal evaluation. The ultrasound morphology of common ovarian and adnexal masses is reviewed. The application and reliability of Doppler assessment is also reviewed. New advances, such as three-dimensional (3-D) sonography, 3-D vascular assessment, and contrast imaging, augment diagnostic accuracy.

CD011126,0,19265205,0,The utility of pelvic coil SNR testing in the quality assurance of a clinical MRgFUS system.,"During MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatments of uterine fibroids using ExAblate 2000, tissue ablations are delivered by a FUS transducer while MR imaging is performed with a pelvic receiver coil. The consistency of the pelvic coil performance is crucial for reliable MR temperature measurements as well as detailed anatomic imaging in patients. Test sonications in a gel phantom combined with MR thermometry are used to test the performance of the FUS transducer prior to each treatment. As we show, however, these tests do not adequately evaluate receiver coil performance prior to clinical use. This could become a problem since the posterior part of the coil is frequently moved and can malfunction. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the utility of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a reliable indicator of pelvic coil performance. Slight modification of the vendor-provided coil support was accomplished to assure reproducible coil positioning. The SNR was measured in a gel phantom using axial acquisitions from the 3D-localizer scan. MR temperature and SNR measurements were obtained using a degraded receiver coil (with posterior element removed) and a known faulty coil, and compared to those obtained with a fully functioning coil. While the MR temperature-based tests were insensitive to change in pelvic coil performance, (degraded, p = 0.24; faulty, p = 0.28), the SNR tests were highly sensitive to coil performance, (degraded, p < 0.001; faulty, p < 0.001). Additional clinical data illustrate the utility of SNR testing of the receiver coil. These tests require minimal (or possibly no) additional scan time and have proven to be effective in our clinical practice."

CD011126,0,26117981,0,Placenta accreta: review and 3 case reports.,"Placenta accreta is characterized by excessive penetration of the villi into the myometrium, which obstructs its correct separation during stage III of labor. That in turn leads to a potentially life-threatening maternal hemorrhage. Until recently this pathology has been a rare occurrence but currently it is fifty times more prevalent. Placenta accreta is associated with high morbidity and the risk of maternal death, even despite advances in ultrasonographic diagnostics, well-established surgical treatment, and multi-disciplinary medical care. A dramatic rise in the rates of Cesarean section and intrauterine surgical procedure is considered to be the main factor responsible for the growing incidence of placenta accreta. It is especially frequent in women after a Cesarean section and with placenta previa covering the lower segment. A Cesarean section, combined with hysterectomy and application of various techniques to limit massive bleeding, is usually performed between 34-36 weeks of pregnancy before the onset of labor. Three cases of placenta accreta are presented."

CD011126,0,19830642,0,[Atrial tumors in cardiac MRI].,"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important tool for the diagnosis of cardiac masses. Various cardiac tumors are predisposed to occurring in atrial structures. The aim of this review article is the description of atrial tumors and their morphological features in MRI. In general, cardiac tumors are rare: approximately 0.001 - 0.03 % in autopsy studies. About 75 % of them are benign. The most common cardiac tumor is the myxoma. They are predisposed to occur in the atria and show a characteristically strong hyperintense signal on T 2-wieghted images in MRI. In other sequences a heterogeneous pattern reflects its variable histological appearance. Lipomas exhibit a signal behavior identical to fatty tissue with a typical passive movement in cine imaging. Fibroelastomas are the most common tumors of the cardiac valves. Consisting of avascular fibrous tissue, they often present with hypointense signal intensities. Thrombi attached to their surface can cause severe emboli even in small tumors. Amongst primary cardiac malignancies, sarcomas are most common and favor the atria. Secondary malignancies of the heart are far more common than primary ones (20 - 40 times). In case of known malignancies, approximately 10 % of patients develop cardiac metastasis at the end of their disease. Lymphogenic metastases favor the pericardium, while hematogenic spread prefers the myocardium. Since they are not real atrial tumors, thrombi and anatomical structures of the atria have to be differentiated from other pathologies."

Well-ordered and three-dimensional porous conductive structures have been obtained by the electrochemical deposition of the aqueous biotin-pyrrole monomer mixture into particle arrays, followed by subsequent removal of the colloidal particles. Advantageously, direct incorporation of biotin molecules enhances the versatility by modifying surfaces through site-directed conjugate formation, thus facilitating further reactions. In addition, the porosity of the surfaces provides a significant impact on enhanced immobilization and efficient release of streptavidin-tagged gold nanoparticles. Biotinylated porous polypyrrole (Ppy) films were characterized by several techniques: (1) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate surface topography, (2) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to assess the potential-dependent chemical composition of the films, (3) four-point probe evaluation to measure the conductivity, cyclic voltammetry to observe surface eletroactivity, and contact angle measurement to evaluate the surface wettability, and (4) fluorescence microscopy to image and quantify the adsorption and release of gold nanoparticles. Overall, our results demonstrate that these biotinylated porous Ppy films, combined with electrical stimulation, permit a programmable release of gold nanoparticles by altering the chemical strength of the Ppy-biotin interaction."

CD011126,0,16185721,0,An application of Lacker's mathematical model for the prediction of ovarian response to superstimulation.,"Introduction. A mathematical model of ovarian follicular growth is applied to the problem of predicting ovarian response in a superstimulation protocol. Methods. Fifty-four women enrolled in an ovarian superstimulation program of therapy for the amelioration of idiopathic infertility had their ovarian cycles synchronized by taking Demulen 30 for two weeks prior to the study. Daily ultrasonographic imaging, measurements of serum estradiol and doses of hMG began on day 5 after the patients stopped taking Demulen. The diameters of individual follicles were measured and followed daily. When the largest follicle attained a diameter of 19 mm, hCG was given to induce ovulation. Individual follicle growth data were fit to a mathematical model of ovarian follicle maturation and the resulting parameters were used to classify patients into low and high ovarian response groups. Results. The parameters computed from the mathematical model fit were found to be predictive of ovarian response with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 70%. The parameters were also meaningful within the context of the original mathematical model and have value for determining how doses of hMG may be adjusted during the course therapy to increase the ovarian response in individuals. Conclusion. Mathematical modeling of ultrasonographically derived follicular growth data has significant potential for clinical application in ovarian superstimulation protocols. The method of fitting follicular growth data to a mathematical follicle maturation surface furthermore provides a straightforward approach for the characterization of ovarian follicular dynamics in general."

Sequential indicator simulation (SIS) was adopted to reproduce As exposure distributions in groundwater based on their three-dimensional variability. A target cancer risk (TR) associated with ingesting As in aquacultural smeltfish was employed to evaluate the potential risk to human health. The probabilistic risk assessment determined by Monte Carlo simulation and SIS is used to propagate properly the uncertainty of parameters. Safe and hazardous aquacultural regions were mapped to elucidate the safety of groundwater use. The TRs determined from the risks at the 95th percentiles exceed one millionth, indicating that ingesting smeltfish that are farmed in the highly As-affected regions represents a potential cancer threat to human health.

This retrospective study included 212 PCOS patients (mean age 28 years) diagnosed by the NIH-criteria and consecutively recruited since 2003. Clinical features including anthropometric variables and the degree of hirsutism, family history, menstrual cyclicity as well as endocrine biochemical parameters were recorded. In addition, 3-h oral glucose tolerance testing for indices of insulin resistance and glucose metabolism was performed in each patient. Transvaginal ultrasound was used to detect polcystic ovaries, defined as the presence of at least one ovary > 10 ml or with at least 12 follicles of 2-9 mm diameter. In this German PCOS cohort, PCO were identified in 166 women (78%). Women with PCO (PXO+) had significantly higher LH/FSH ratios (median 2.1 vs. 1.7) and IGF-1 levels (median 182.5 vs. 160.5 ng/ml) compared to patients without PCO (PCO-). In addition, a significantly higher prevalence of acne (50% vs. 33%) and higher hirsutism scores (median 9 vs. 7) were found in PCO+ patients. Testosterone levels and the free androgen index (FAI) correlated significantly with ovarian volume and the number of ovarian follicles. Also, a subgroup of PCO+ women with a combination of increased ovarian volume and follicle number had higher testosterone levels (median 3.1 vs. 2.1 nmol/l) and FAI (median 7.6 vs. 4.5) compared to women with increased follicle count but normal volume.

CD011126,0,15875241,0,Updated recommendations on ultrasonography in urogynecology.,"Ultrasound is a supplementary, indispensable diagnostic procedure in urogynecology; perineal, introital, and endoanal ultrasound are the most recommended techniques. The position and mobility of the bladder neck can be demonstrated. In patients undergoing diagnostic work-up for urge symptoms, ultrasound occasionally demonstrates urethral diverticula, leiomyomas, and cysts in the vaginal wall. These findings will lead to further diagnostic assessment. The same applies to the demonstration of bladder diverticula, foreign bodies in the bladder, and bullous edema. With endoanal ultrasound, different parts of the sphincter ani muscle can be evaluated. Recommendations for the standardized use of urogenital ultrasound are given."

CD011126,0,24464063,0,[Computed tomography colonography image assessment using colon phantom-effects of reconstructed slice thickness].,"Computed tomography colonography (CTC) is a robust and reliable imaging test of the colon. Recent studies show good sensitivity for the identification of nonpolypoid (flat) lesions as well. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy and reproducibility of a volume-rendering (VR) and virtual gross pathology (VGP) technique for detecting a polypoid lesion phantom by varying slice thickness. The scan of a simulated house-made phantom was performed using a 16-slice CT scanner with varying combinations of tube voltage (120 kVp), effective exposure (100 mAs), detector configuration (16×0.75 mm), rotation time (0.75 s), helical pitch (0.688, 0.938, 1.066 and 1.188), reconstruction kernel (A, B and C), and section thickness/reconstruction interval (0.8/0.4, 1.0/0.5 and 1.5/0.75 mm). All image data were transferred to a three-dimensional workstation to assess multi-planar reformation (MPR), VR and VGP. Accuracy of volume measurement using the VR technique for quantitative analysis was compared using a paired t-test. Four radiological technologists also independently evaluated the visual score using the VGP technique for qualitative analysis, and their evaluations were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Fisher's protected least significant difference post-hoc test. There was a statistically significant difference in reproducibility between the three different slice thicknesses as to volume measurement and observer performance test (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). Furthermore, the reproducibility improved when using thinner slices. In conclusion, VR and VGP techniques using a slice thickness of 0.8 mm made it possible to maintain accuracy and reproducibility when using CTC to detect polypoid lesions."

CD011126,0,19072774,0,Sonographic features of primary ovarian fibrosarcoma: a report of two cases.,"Two cases of primary cellular fibroblastic tumor of the ovary are described, which presented a challenging clinical and histopathological differential diagnosis of primary ovarian fibrosarcoma and mitotically active cellular fibroma. On sonographic evaluation they both appeared as solid lesions with irregular margins, and on histological analysis both showed a count of 5-7 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields. Histopathological examination of the first case was characterized by the presence of hemorrhage, necrosis and severe nuclear atypia, with a metastatic peritoneal lesion, and the eventual diagnosis was primary ovarian fibrosarcoma. The second case, however, was diagnosed as a 'mitotically active cellular fibroma' owing to the lack of substantial severe cellular atypia, hemorrhage or necrosis. We speculate that ovarian fibrosarcoma at the preoperative examination might be considered in the differential diagnosis whenever a unilateral, heterogeneous, largely round solid ovarian lesion is detected."
CD011126,0,15480191,0,Sonographic diagnosis of primary malignant tumors of the fallopian tube.,"The purpose of this study is to illustrate the sonographic features of primary malignant tumors of the fallopian tube and to heighten awareness of their existence. This is a retrospective review of the imaging and clinical files of 7 patients with a primary malignant tumor of the fallopian tube found in the medical records of 4500 patients with primary gynecologic malignancies seen during the last 6 years at the authors' institution. All patients had transvaginal sonography before surgery. Images were reviewed to determine common features of this rarely encountered pathology. Transvaginal sonography showed normal ovaries in 5 patients in association with a discrete solid adnexal mass in 4. The fallopian tube origin of the mass was shown directly in 2 of these 4 patients and was inferred in the other 2 on the basis of a mass in the expected location of the fallopian tube. In the 3 patients without a discrete adnexal mass, there were more extensive changes, including large, solid adnexal masses of unknown origin (n = 2) and gross peritoneal carcinomatosis (n = 1). Fallopian tube malignancies should be considered when unexplained solid masses corresponding with the expected location of the fallopian tubes are seen in association with normal ovaries. Disease dissemination may show carcinomatosis or more extensive pelvic disease."

A randomised controlled trial.,"In in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment a large drop is present between embryo transfer and occurrence of pregnancy. The implantation rate per embryo transferred is only 30%. Studies have shown that minor intrauterine abnormalities can be found in 11-45% of infertile women with a normal transvaginal sonography or hysterosalpingography. Two randomised controlled trials have indicated that detection and treatment of these abnormalities by office hysteroscopy after two failed IVF cycles leads to a 9-13% increase in pregnancy rate. Therefore, screening of all infertile women for intracavitary pathology prior to the start of IVF/ICSI is increasingly advocated. In absence of a scientific basis for such a policy, this study will assess the effects and costs of screening for and treatment of unsuspected intrauterine abnormalities by routine office hysteroscopy, with or without saline infusion sonography (SIS), prior to a first IVF/ICSI cycle."

For millennia, manual palpation has been used to assist in diagnosis, but it is subjective and restricted to larger and more superficial structures. Following an introduction to the subject of elasticity, the elasticity of biological soft tissues is discussed and published data are presented. The basic physical principles of pulse-echo and Doppler ultrasonic techniques are explained. The history of ultrasonic imaging of soft tissue strain and elasticity is summarized, together with a brief critique of previously published reviews. The relevant techniques-low-frequency vibration, step, freehand and physiological displacement, and radiation force (displacement, impulse, shear wave and acoustic emission)-are described. Tissue-mimicking materials are indispensible for the assessment of these techniques and their characteristics are reported. Emerging clinical applications in breast disease, cardiology, dermatology, gastroenterology, gynaecology, minimally invasive surgery, musculoskeletal studies, radiotherapy, tissue engineering, urology and vascular disease are critically discussed. It is concluded that ultrasonic imaging of soft tissue strain and elasticity is now sufficiently well developed to have clinical utility. The potential for further research is examined and it is anticipated that the technology will become a powerful mainstream investigative tool."

In cases of solid or solid/cystic lesions a US guided FNB for histology as well as cytology was proposed. All 35 primary ovarian cancers, 6 of 7 secondary ovarian cancers, and 3 of 4 non-ovarian cancers were demonstrated on US. Among 17 cases with normal palpation and an ovarian mass on US, operation disclosed 3 ovarian cancers. FNB identified 24 of 27 primary ovarian cancers and 7 of 7 cancers of extra-ovarian origin. The use of US, in this study, increased the detection of masses in the pelvis and FNB provided a reliable verification."

CD011126,0,24456441,0,Use of ultrasound in emergency gynaecology.,"Ultrasound scan (USS) is an important tool for assessing and diagnosing early pregnancy and gynaecological emergencies. Providing an ultrasound scanning service at all hours would enable and ease prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. It would also help hospitals in reducing costs secondary to unnecessary admissions due to lack of ultrasound out of hours. We have conducted a retrospective observational study that looked into the out of hours admissions to a busy early pregnancy unit in a general district hospital, over a 3-month period. Our results highlight the important role and possible benefits of using ultrasound out of hours and prove it is a cost-effective approach. However, providing ultrasound scanning out of hours is affected by limitations of staff and resources at each unit. This could be avoided by following a multidisciplinary approach in acute services and providing more training for medical staff in ultrasound scanning."

Since primary tumours of the omentum are rare, there is a paucity of information about the biology of such tumors in the basic texts and literature. An ultrasound examination of the patient revealed a mass, likely of ovarian origin, which consisted of liquid and solid components. It was suspected to be a malignant ovarian tumor. However, laparotomy demonstrated it was an omental tumor. This case shows that it can be difficult to pre-operatively diagnose omental fibromas because of their close resemblance to ovarian tumors."
CD011126,0,15202836,0,Correlation between endocrinological parameters and acne severity in adult women.,"Many studies demonstrate increased androgen levels and high prevalence of polycystic ovaries in women affected by acne. We evaluated the relationship between clinical features, ultrasonographic data on polycystic ovaries and hormonal parameters in 129 women >17 years of age with acne. Serum levels of androgens of ovarian and adrenal origin were measured. Menstrual cycle regularity, hirsutism, body mass index and ultrasonographic evaluation of ovaries were recorded. Raised levels of at least one androgen were evident in a majority of our patients. Only 19% of them had polycystic ovary syndrome. Hirsutism and acne severity correlated negatively with serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels (p<0.05). No correlation between acne severity and hirsutism was found. In post-pubertal women, severity of acne seems to depend on peripheral hyperandrogenism, with a negative relationship between the acne severity and serum SHBG levels. We strongly recommend the evaluation of serum SHBG levels in women with acne in order to select patients who can have a better response to appropriate hormonal regimes."

By following patients who had come for routine check ups, prompted by a positive family history for malignant processes, resistant indexes of blood vessels in the adnexal region and vascularisation pattern were determined. Out of 78 women observed in the postmenopausal period with diagnosed adnexal masses, we found two cases of fallopian tube cancer. Resistance indexes ranged between 0.20 and 0.30 during a one-month period. Hystopathological analysis pointed to fallopian tube cancer. Besides Doppler flow, only patient history of amber extract use was significant. By CA 125 marker analysis, we found an increased value but not signifiant enough. Both patients had a positive family history according to the female hereditary line."

Ultrasonographical examinations revealed a 15X14 cm heterogenous pelvic mass with calcific foci in the left adnexal area. Macroscopically, the resected mass was oval and measured 18X15X15 cm and weighed 3150 gm. Histological examination showed both gonadoblastic and YST areas. There were many gonadoblastic nests in the subcapsular areas of the tumor. The gonadoblastic nests were composed of large and small cells. The YST areas showed enteric differentiation and numerous hyaline globules. Immunohistochemical examination may help in the diagnosis of these gonadoblastoma with YST."

Such malformations have been proven to be associated with poor reproductive performance. A prospective observational study was conducted with 30 infertile women with dysmorphic uterus who underwent the novel Hysteroscopic Outpatient Metroplasty to Expand Dysmorphic Uteri (HOME-DU ) technique. Incisions are made on the uterine walls with a 5 Fr bipolar electrode. The procedure was conducted in outpatients under conscious sedation, using a 5-mm office hysteroscope. The technique was successful in all cases without complications. A net increase of uterine volume was found, as measured at hysteroscopy and three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (P < 0.001). Uterine morphology improved in all patients but one. At mean follow-up of 15 months, clinical pregnancy rate was 57% and term delivery rate 65%. These early data support HOME-DU as safe and effective in expanding the volume and normalizing the appearance of the uterine cavity of dysmorphic uteri. Although the cohort was small, pregnancy and live births outcomes were favourable in this poor-prognosis group, implying desirable benefits, which should be compared with other techniques."

The study group was composed of 41 patients who underwent chemotherapy during pre-menarche (subgroup A; n = 15) and after menarche (subgroup B; n = 26); the control group was composed of 44 patients admitted with non-cancer related diseases (in total n = 85). Mean total ovarian volume and total antral follicle counts on ultrasound examination were significantly lower in the study group compared with the control group (3.5 ± 2.3 versus 5.2 ± 2.4 ml; P = 0.001; and 3.4 ± 3.3 versus 8.6 ± 3.5; P < 0.001, respectively). Mean FSH level was significantly higher in the study group (13.5 ± 16.2 versus 7.3 ± 2.7 mIU/ml; P = 0.017). Anti-Müllerian hormone levels in subgroup A were significantly higher than in subgroup B (1.8 ± 0.1 versus 1.5 ± 0.08 pg/dl; P = 0.034). In conclusion ovarian volume, antral follicle count and FSH can be used for evaluating the harmful effect of cancer chemotherapy on ovarian follicles. Post-menarche, Anti-Müllerian values reveal that ovarian follicles are more sensitive to the devastating effects of cytotoxic treatment."

The present case is of an ovarian torsion in a pregnant woman at 6.5 weeks with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome due to in vitro fertilization. Gray-scale images of endovaginal two-dimensional ultrasonography revealed enlargement of the right ovary and multiple peripheral follicles. Two-dimensional ultrasonography in color Doppler mode revealed the absence of venous flow and reduction in arterial flow to the impaired ovary. 3D power Doppler allowed the appropriate quantitative assessment of tissue vessel density of the impaired ovary, which greatly influenced the decision for conservative surgical treatment. The 3D power Doppler assessment performed after the surgery confirmed the integrity of the ovarian tissue. 3D power Doppler can help in the selection of patients with ovarian torsion for conservative surgical treatment."

Unexplained, heavy vaginal bleeding in a reproductive age woman should raise suspicion for an AVM. Here a 37-year-old woman had increasingly severe vaginal bleeding for 15 days. Serum β-hCG was elevated. Two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound suggested retained products of conception. Before dilation and curettage (D&C), color Doppler and three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler demonstrated findings indicative of uterine AVM. A bilateral uterine artery embolization was performed without complications. Three months after uterine artery embolization, 3D power Doppler ultrasonography found complete resolution of the AVM. This case illustrates the importance of assessing both gray-scale and 3D power Doppler, and the ability of postprocedure Doppler to assess resolution."

Herein is reported a case of supernumerary ovary detected in a 31-year-old woman who complained of lower abdominal pain on her left side. Ultrasonography indicated a cystic mass in the pelvis, the size of which fluctuated periodically. A laparotomy was performed and indicated two normal ovaries in addition to a cystic mass in the cul-de-sac. Histology of the mass confirmed the presence of both normal ovarian tissue and cystic corpus luteal tissue consistent with the presence of a supernumerary ovary. Examination of the patient's medical history suggested that the supernumerary ovary was likely to be of embryonic origin, and not caused by surgical treatment or inflammation. This is the first report of a supernumerary ovary that was associated with periodic episodes of pain and changes in size, and a giant corpus luteal cyst near the rectum."

CD011126,0,18957615,0,Anti-Mullerian hormone levels reflect severity of PCOS but are negatively influenced by obesity: relationship with increased luteinizing hormone levels.,"The objective of the study was the comparison of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels among obese or overweight and normal-weight women with the four different polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes and healthy control subjects. AMH levels were evaluated in four age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched groups of 25 normal-weight and 25 obese or overweight women each, belonging to the four main subsets of the syndrome resulting from combinations of the three diagnostic criteria [group 1: oligo- and/or anovulation (ANOV), hyperandrogenemia (HA), and polycystic ovaries (PCO) on ultrasonographic evaluation; group 2: ANOV and HA; group 3: HA and PCO, group 4: ANOV and PCO], and in 50 (25 obese or overweight and 25 normal weight) age- and BMI-matched healthy control subjects. Age, BMI, waist circumference, FSH, LH, prolactin, testosterone, Delta(4)-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, 17alpha-OH-progesterone, fasting insulin, glucose, AMH, free androgen index, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance index were analyzed. AMH levels were significantly higher in PCOS groups 1 and 2 compared with groups 3 and 4 and the control group and higher in PCOS groups 3 and 4 compared with the control group. AMH levels were significantly increased in normal-weight compared with obese and overweight women. AMH concentrations were independently predicted, in order of significance, by LH and testosterone levels, BMI (negatively), and the total number of follicles 2-9 mm in diameter. The differences in circulating AMH levels between the main phenotypic groups of PCOS women appear to reflect the severity of the syndrome, but are negatively affected by obesity. Increased LH levels might be the most significant independent link between PCOS-associated disorders of ovulation and the observed increase in circulating AMH concentration."

CD011126,0,12899491,0,Ultrasonographic evaluation of the endometrium in postmenopausal vaginal bleeding.,"Transvaginal ultrasound with SIS is a cost-minimizing screening tool for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding. Its use decreases the need for invasive diagnostic procedures for women without abnormalities, and ultrasound increases the sensitivity of detecting abnormalities in women with pathologic conditions. Vaginal sonography is preferred over uniform biopsy of postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding because it (1) is a less invasive procedure, (2) is generally painless, (3) has no complications, and (4) may be more sensitive for detecting carcinoma than blind biopsy. Transvaginal sonography is rarely nondiagnostic. Endometrial sampling is less successful in women with a thin endometrial stripe on ultrasound than in women with real endometrial pathologic condition. A limitation of ultrasound is that an abnormal finding is not specific: ultrasound cannot always reliably distinguish between benign proliferation, hyperplasia, polyps, and cancer. Although ultrasound may not be able to distinguish between hyperplasia and malignancy, the next step in the clinical treatment requires tissue sampling. Because of the risk of progression of complex hyperplasia to carcinoma, patients with this finding may benefit from hormonal suppression, dilatation and curettage, endometrial ablation, or hysterectomy, depending on the clinical scenario. The inability to distinguish these two entities based on ultrasound alone should not be seen as a limitation because tissue sampling is required in either case. Occasionally (in 5% to 10% of cases), a woman's endometrium cannot be identified on ultrasound, and these women also need further evaluation. Ultrasonography also may be used as a first-line investigation in other populations with abnormal uterine bleeding. In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of 400 women with abnormal uterine bleeding, the investigators found that transvaginal sonography combined with Pipelle endometrial biopsy and outpatient hysteroscopy was as effective as inpatient hysteroscopy and curettage. The subject, included women older than 35 years with PMB, menorrhagia, intermenstrual bleeding, postcoital bleeding, or irregular menses. Transvaginal sonography may be a cost-effective. sensitive, and well-tolerated method to evaluate most women with abnormal bleeding in combination with physical examination and endometrial biopsy and hysteroscopy us indicated. Hysteroscopy is likely to become the new gold standard in the future because of its ability to visualize directly the endometrium and perform directed biopsies as indicated. As office-based hysteroscopy becomes more practical and widespread, the technique may become more cost effective. An evaluation plan using transvaginal sonography as the initial screening evaluation followed by endometrial biopsy or, more likely, hysteroscopy is likely to become the standard of care (Fig. 12). It remains unproven whether certain patients at higher risk for carcinoma should proceed directly to invasive evaluation. Women on tamoxifen with persistent recurrent bleeding, women with significant risk factors for carcinoma, and women with life-threatening hemorrhage comprise this group. Further studies are still necessary to evaluate high-risk patients and determine whether ultrasound or biopsy is really the most cost-effective initial test."

CD011126,0,24786841,0,A novel method to quantify and compare anatomical shape: application in cervix cancer radiotherapy.,"Adaptive radiation therapy (ART) had been proposed to restore dosimetric deficiencies during treatment delivery. In this paper, we developed a technique of Geometric reLocation for analyzing anatomical OBjects' Evolution (GLOBE) for a numerical model of tumor evolution under radiation therapy and characterized geometric changes of the target using GLOBE. A total of 174 clinical target volumes (CTVs) obtained from 32 cervical cancer patients were analyzed. GLOBE consists of three main steps; step (1) deforming a 3D surface object to a sphere by parametric active contour (PAC), step (2) sampling a deformed PAC on 642 nodes of icosahedron geodesic dome for reference frame, and step (3) unfolding 3D data to 2D plane for convenient visualization and analysis. The performance was evaluated with respect to (1) convergence of deformation (iteration number and computation time) and (2) accuracy of deformation (residual deformation). Based on deformation vectors from planning CTV to weekly CTVs, target specific (TS) margins were calculated on each sampled node of GLOBE and the systematic (Σ) and random (σ) variations of the vectors were calculated. Population based anisotropic (PBA) margins were generated using van Herk's margin recipe. GLOBE successfully modeled 152 CTVs from 28 patients. Fast convergence was observed for most cases (137/152) with the iteration number of 65 ± 74 (average ± STD) and the computation time of 13.7 ± 18.6 min. Residual deformation of PAC was 0.9 ± 0.7 mm and more than 97% was less than 3 mm. Margin analysis showed random nature of TS-margin. As a consequence, PBA-margins perform similarly to ISO-margins. For example, PBA-margins for 90% patients' coverage with 95% dose level is close to 13 mm ISO-margins in the aspect of target coverage and OAR sparing. GLOBE demonstrates a systematic analysis of tumor motion and deformation of patients with cervix cancer during radiation therapy and numerical modeling of PBA-margin on 642 locations of CTV surface."

CD011126,0,16984764,0,Impact of ovarian endometrioma on assisted reproduction outcomes.,"The effects of ovarian endometrioma on fertility outcomes with IVF and embryo transfer have been causally related to poor outcomes. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the ovarian reserve and ovarian responsiveness to ovarian stimulation and assisted reproduction outcomes in patients with ovarian endometrioma. The odds for clinical pregnancy were not affected significantly in patients with ovarian endometrioma compared with controls, with an overall odds ratio of 1.07 from three studies [95% CI: (0.63, 1.81), P = 0.79]. The overall pregnancy rate was similar with an estimated odds ratio of 1.17 [95% CI: (0.85, 1.60), P = 0.34]. Decreased ovarian responsiveness to ovarian stimulation in patients with ovarian endometrioma may be due to a reduced number of follicles in these patients compared with controls (P = 0.002). Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to assess whether surgical treatment versus no surgical treatment improves pregnancy outcomes in patients with ovarian endometrioma undergoing assisted reproduction cycles."
CD011126,0,23246186,0,An update on adenomyosis.,"Adenomyosis is a common benign uterine pathology that is defined by the presence of islands of ectopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium. It is asymptomatic in one third of cases, but when there are clinical signs they remain non-specific. It can often be misdiagnosed on sonography as it may be taken to be multiple uterine leiomyomata or endometrial thickening, both of which have a different prognosis and treatment. Adenomyosis is often associated with hormone-dependent pelvic lesions (myoma, endometriosis, or endometrial hyperplasia). It is less commonly connected to infertility or obstetrical complications and indeed any direct relationship remains controversial. The purpose of imaging is to make the diagnosis, to determine the extent of spread (focal or diffuse, superficial or deep adenomyosis, adenomyoma), and to check whether there is any associated disease, in particular endometriosis. The aim of this article is to provide assistance in recognising adenomyosis on imaging and to identify the pathologies that are commonly associated with it in order to guide the therapeutic management of symptomatic patients. Pelvic ultrasonography is the first line investigation. Sonohysterography can assist with diagnosis in some cases (pseudothickening of the endometrium seen on sonography). MRI may be used in addition to sonography to back up the diagnosis and to look for any associated disease."

Both have been prepared with wide consultation within and outside the BSCC and have been endorsed by the Royal College of Pathologists. A separate code of practice for gynaecological cytopathology is in preparation. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is an accepted first line investigation for mass lesions, which may be targeted by palpation or a variety of imaging methods. Although FNA cytology has been shown to be a cost-effective, reliable technique its accurate interpretation depends on obtaining adequately cellular samples prepared to a high standard. Its accuracy and cost-effectiveness can be seriously compromised by inadequate samples. Although cytopathologists, radiologists, nurses or clinicians may take FNAs, they must be adequately trained, experienced and subject to regular audit. The best results are obtained when a pathologist or an experienced and trained biomedical scientist (cytotechnologist) provides immediate on-site assessment of sample adequacy whether or not the FNA requires image-guidance. This COP provides evidence-based recommendations for setting up FNA services, managing the patients, taking the samples, preparing the slides, collecting material for ancillary tests, providing rapid on-site assessment, classifying the diagnosis and providing a final report. Costs, cost-effectiveness and rare complications are taken into account as well as the time and resources required for quality control, audit and correlation of cytology with histology and outcome. Laboratories are expected to have an effective quality management system conforming to the requirements of a recognised accreditation scheme such as Clinical Pathology Accreditation (UK) Ltd."
CD011126,0,18955753,0,Microvessel density assessment in benign and malignant endometrial changes.,"Tumor angiogenesis is believed to be a prognostic indicator associated with tumor growth and metastasis. Microvessel density (MVD) assessment with common endothelial markers such as CD34 has been found to influence prognosis among endometrial carcinoma patients. The CD105/endoglin antibody has been reported to preferentially bind to proliferated endothelial cells in tissues participating in angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantification of angiogenesis by assessing MVD in endometrial lesions when comparing the performance of anti-CD34 and anti-CD105 in women with benign and malignant endometrial changes. The study included 58 women (37 postmenopausal) with normal, hyperplastic and malignant endometrium in which preoperative transvaginal sonography was performed. Histological results of the removed endometrium were correlated with MVD assessed in ""hot areas"" where high densities of microvessels were detected within tumoral tissue. Endometrial cancer was confirmed in 37 women (3 premenopausal). Benign hyperplasia (14 cases), secretory or proliferative endometrium (5 cases) or endometrial atrophy (2 cases) was found in the remaining women. Malignant changes were mostly noted as FIGO stage I and II (28 cases) and had a low (1 or 2) histological grade (29 cases). Median MVD's assessed with CD105 and CD34 were 10.4 and 32.3, respectively. Median MVD assessed with CD34 was almost twice higher in women with endometrial cancer than in women with benign endometrium (CD34 MVD = 41.8 vs. 27.6, p=0.004). In cases of CD105 MVD significant differences between women with benign and malignant endometrial changes were also found (CD105 MVD = 11.8, vs. 6.4; p=0.00007). The menopausal status, but not the clinical stage or histological grading was significantly correlated with both CD34 MVD (p=0.02) and CD105 MVD (p=0.0003). A significant correlation was also found between CD34 and CD105 measured MVD (p=0.000001). In conclusion, transition from endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer appears to be accompanied by microvessel density changes. MVD assessed with both CD34 and CD105 antibodies could be used as a potential prognostic factor in women with endometrial cancer. Our study showed that endoglin, by staining the proliferating microvessels could be more specific and sensitive marker for tumor neoangiogenesis than the more commonly used marker, CD34."

CD011126,0,14698334,0,Accuracy of three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound in uterus volume measurements; comparison with two-dimensional ultrasound.,"The purpose of this study was to document the accuracy of 3-D uterus volume and to compare it with 2-D measurements. Transvaginal ultrasound (US) examinations were performed in 48 consecutive patients before hysterectomy. The examinations were stored digitally on an internal disk drive for subsequent measurements in virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL) program. Immediately after the hysterectomy, the true volume was measured in a water bath. A total of 5 patients were excluded due to difficulty of identifying the borders of their uterus; 8 patients were excluded because of too large fibroids or diffuse hypertrophic enlargement of uterus (volume > 220 mL). Although the volumes estimated by the 3-D method were not significantly different (p = 0.126 first measurement, p = 0.561 second measurement), the volumes estimated by the 2-D method were significantly different (p = 0.005 first measurement, p = 0.012 second measurement). The mean error rates of the two 3-D volume measurements by the same observer were 7.4% and 7.9%, and they were 22.2% and 21.0% for the 2-D volume measurements. It may be concluded that the volume of the uterus can be measured more accurately by 3-D US than by 2-D US."

CD011126,0,19673184,0,A novel flexible framework with automatic feature correspondence optimization for nonrigid registration in radiotherapy.,"Technical improvements in planning and dose delivery and in verification of patient positioning have substantially widened the therapeutic window for radiation treatment of cancer. However, changes in patient anatomy during the treatment limit the exploitation of these new techniques. To further improve radiation treatments, anatomical changes need to be modeled and accounted for Nonrigid registration can be used for this purpose. This article describes the design, the implementation, and the validation of a new framework for nonrigid registration for radiotherapy applications. The core of this framework is an improved version of the thin plate spline robust point matching (TPS-RPM) algorithm. The TPS-RPM algorithm estimates a global correspondence and a transformation between the points that represent organs of interest belonging to two image sets. However, the algorithm does not allow for the inclusion of prior knowledge on the correspondence of subset of points, and therefore, it can lead to inconsistent anatomical solutions. In this article TPS-RPM was improved by employing a novel correspondence filter that supports simultaneous registration of multiple structures. The improved method allows for coherent organ registration and for the inclusion of user-defined landmarks, lines, and surfaces inside and outside of structures of interest. A procedure to generate control points from segmented organs is described. The framework parameters r and lambda, which control the number of points and the nonrigidness of the transformation, respectively, were optimized for three sites with different degrees of deformation (head and neck, prostate, and cervix) using two cases per site. For the head and neck cases, the salivary glands were manually contoured on CT scans, for the prostate cases the prostate and the vesicles, and for the cervix cases the cervix uterus, the bladder, and the rectum. The transformation error obtained using the best set of parameters was below 1 mm for all the studied cases. The lengths of the deformation vectors were on average (+/- 1 standard deviation) 5.8 +/- 2.5 and 2.6 +/- 1.1 mm for the head and neck cases, 7.2 +/- 4.5 and 8.6 +/- 1.9 mm for the prostate cases, and 19.0 +/- 11.6 and 14.5 +/- 9.3 mm for the cervix cases. Distinguishable anatomical features were identified for each case and were used to validate the registration by calculating residual distances after transformation: 1.5 +/- 0.8, 2.3 +/- 1.0, and 6.3 +/- 2.9 mm for the head and neck, prostate, and cervix sites, respectively. Finally, the authors demonstrated how the inclusion of these anatomical features in the registration process reduced the residual distances to 0.8 +/- 0.5, 0.6 +/- 0.5, and 1.3 +/- 0.7 mm for the head and neck, prostate, and cervix sites, respectively. The inclusion of additional anatomical features produced more anatomically coherent transformations without compromising the transformation error. The authors concluded that the presented nonrigid registration framework is a powerful tool to simultaneously register multiple segmented organs with very different complexities."

CD011126,0,24131970,0,Alternatives to risk-reducing surgery for ovarian cancer.,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have an 18%-60% and 11%-27% lifetime risk of developing ovarian carcinoma, respectively. Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy reduces the risk of this malignancy by up to 96%. Gynecological screening programs with periodical trans-vaginal ultrasound and serum CA125 assay have been widely used in women at hereditary high risk of ovarian carcinoma, but clinical results have been conflicting. These surveillance protocols have often fallen short of expectations because of the advanced stage of ovarian carcinoma in the identified screened women. Several investigations have been addressed to the detection of additional tumor markers able to generate more reliable screening tools. The combined serum assay of leptin, prolactin, osteopontin, CA125, macrophage inhibiting factor and insulin-like growth factor-II appears to have a significant better diagnostic reliability compared with serum CA125 alone in discriminating healthy individuals from ovarian carcinoma patients, and therefore, it could have a role in the screening of women at high risk for this malignancy. As far as chemoprevention is concerned, oral contraceptives significantly reduce the ovarian carcinoma risk also in BRCA mutation carriers, whereas the efficacy of fenretinide is still under investigation."

CD011126,0,20671355,0,Interactive multiobjective optimization for anatomy-based three-dimensional HDR brachytherapy.,"In this paper, we present an anatomy-based three-dimensional dose optimization approach for HDR brachytherapy using interactive multiobjective optimization (IMOO). In brachytherapy, the goals are to irradiate a tumor without causing damage to healthy tissue. These goals are often conflicting, i.e. when one target is optimized the other will suffer, and the solution is a compromise between them. IMOO is capable of handling multiple and strongly conflicting objectives in a convenient way. With the IMOO approach, a treatment planner's knowledge is used to direct the optimization process. Thus, the weaknesses of widely used optimization techniques (e.g. defining weights, computational burden and trial-and-error planning) can be avoided, planning times can be shortened and the number of solutions to be calculated is small. Further, plan quality can be improved by finding advantageous trade-offs between the solutions. In addition, our approach offers an easy way to navigate among the obtained Pareto optimal solutions (i.e. different treatment plans). When considering a simulation model of clinical 3D HDR brachytherapy, the number of variables is significantly smaller compared to IMRT, for example. Thus, when solving the model, the CPU time is relatively short. This makes it possible to exploit IMOO to solve a 3D HDR brachytherapy optimization problem. To demonstrate the advantages of IMOO, two clinical examples of optimizing a gynecologic cervix cancer treatment plan are presented."

CD011126,0,24780415,0,Imaging techniques for the pre-surgical diagnosis of adnexal tumours.,"A correct diagnosis of any adnexal mass is essential to triage women to appropriate treatment pathways. Several imaging techniques are available that may be used to provide an assessment of a mass before treatment, such as transvaginal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography. In this chapter, we focus in depth on the role of transvaginal ultrasonography, as current evidence suggests it is the most appropriate initial imaging investigation to identify and characterise any mass if present in women suspected of having adnexal pathology. Subjective assessment by an experienced ultrasound examiner is the optimal approach to diagnose masses, followed by risk models and rules developed by the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis study. A group of tumours has proven difficult to classify with transvaginal ultrasound, and remain a diagnostic challenge for which accurate second-stage tests would be of value. Some studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with other imaging modalities, may play a role in the assessment of this cohort of 'difficult to classify' adnexal masses. These studies, however, did not report quality of transvaginal ultrasonography (i.e. experience level of the examiner) and lacked uniformity in describing the criteria used to define such 'difficult' masses. On the basis of standardised terminology developed by the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis study to describe adnexal masses, as well as prediction models and rules developed in the course of the study, we propose new criteria that we can use to clearly define complex or 'difficult to classify' adnexal masses to focus the role for second-line imaging tests, such as conventional magnetic resonance imaging combined with dynamic contrast-enhanced or diffusion-weighted sequences on masses where further tests other than ultrasonography would be of value."

CD011126,0,25963680,0,The impact of goal-directed transvaginal ultrasonography on clinical decision-making for emergency physicians.,"The aim of study was to determine the impact of ""goal-directed transvaginal ultrasonography"" (TVUSG) on real-time clinical decision making of attending emergency physicians evaluating their level of certainty for preliminary diagnosis, admission, surgery, treatment, additional laboratory, and discharge in patients presenting with acute pelvic pain to the emergency department (ED). This prospective cross-sectional clinical study was conducted on sexually active female patients older than 18 years who presented with acute pelvic pain in the ED. The level of certainty of clinical decision making as mentioned above was measured by a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 mm with 100 mm being most certain before and after TVUSG. Statistical analysis was performed on 88 patients. The mean age was 31.7 ±8.3 years with a median of 30 years. Among clinical decisions, there was a significant difference between pre-TVUSG and post-TVUSG certainty of the decision to perform preliminary diagnoses derived from patient's history and physical examination but not in the other outcomes (treatment, admission, surgery, and discharge). (P = .05). Of the patients included in the study, 11 (12.5%) were admitted to hospital, and 2 (2.3%) of them were operated on. The remaining 75 (85.2%) patients were discharged from the ED; of the patients that had been discharged, 18 (20.5%) patients later consulted another physician, and no further pathology could be discovered. In conclusion, US performed by attending emergency physicians may affect the certainty of their decisions in patients presenting with acute pelvic pain. This effect statistically significantly on the decision to determine preliminary diagnosis."
CD011126,0,21680807,0,"Physician knowledge and awareness of CA-125 as a screen for ovarian cancer in the asymptomatic, average-risk population.","Effective early detection strategies for ovarian cancer do not exist. Current screening guidelines recommend against routine screening using CA-125 alone or in combination with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS). In this study, the authors used the 2008 DocStyles survey to measure clinician beliefs about the effectiveness of CA-125 and TVS in the asymptomatic, average-risk population in the United States. To assess the need for provider education, the authors used the 2008 HealthStyles survey to examine public awareness of CA-125. Of 1,250 physician respondents, 40.4% said both CA-125 and TVS were effective screens, and 28.3% said neither was an effective ovarian cancer screen in the asymptomatic, average-risk population. Obstetrician/gynecologists [OB/GYNs] more often had responses consistent with current guidelines: 56.5% of OB/GYNs, compared with 34.4% and 29.8% of family/general practitioners and internists, respectively, said neither CA-125 nor TVS was an effective screen. Almost one third of women surveyed reported having heard of CA-125, and about one tenth said they had the CA-125 test. These findings support the need for additional provider education. Educational efforts should include lack of evidence for, as well as the potential harms of, screening for ovarian cancer with CA-125."

CD011126,0,8365514,0,Replacing diagnostic curettage by vaginal ultrasound.,"Dilatation and curettage has for many years been the method of choice for diagnosing endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. However, less than 10% of women with postmenopausal bleeding have an endometrial cancer. Vaginal sonography for measuring endometrial thickness, has in several studies proved to be a sensitive diagnostic method for diagnosing endometrial pathology. Our studies as well as others have shown that an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less (including both endometrial layers) indicates a very low risk for endometrial carcinoma as well as any other major endometrial pathology in women with postmenopausal bleeding. Since vaginal sonography is such a simple and a non-invasive diagnostic method, it thus seems reasonable that vaginal sonographic assessment of the endometrium should be the primary method for excluding any endometrial abnormality in a woman with postmenopausal bleeding."

The final diagnosis was made following pathological examination. Tumoral arterial blood flow was detected in all (26) patients with endometrial cancer. The blood flow analysis showed a significantly lower (P < 0.05) resistance index (RI = 0.37 +/- 0.07) in the cases of endometrial cancer than in patients with benign uterine lesions (0.54 +/- 0.09). Central vessels within endometrial carcinoma tended to have lower velocity and impedance compared to peripheral ones. Significant difference in the impedance of uterine artery blood flow, represented with RI between mentioned groups occurred (P < 0.05). There is a downward trend in the uterine artery RI in patients with endometrial cancer (mean RI = 0.64, ranged from 0.53 to 0.72) regarding benign lesions (mean RI 0.74, ranged from 0.64 to 0.82)."

Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of a comprehensive 60-min MR-based screening examination in healthy volunteers and a limited number of patients with known target disease. In ten healthy volunteers (7 men, 3 women; mean age, 32.4 years) and five patients (4 men, 1 woman; mean age, 56.2 years) with proven target disease we evaluated the performance of a comprehensive MR screening strategy by combining well-established organ-based MR examination components encompassing the brain, the arterial system, the heart, the lungs, and the colon. All ten volunteers and five patients tolerated the comprehensive MR examination well. The mean in-room time was 63 min. In one volunteer, insufficient colonic cleansing on the part of the volunteer diminished the diagnostic reliability of MR colonography. All remaining components of the comprehensive MR examination were considered diagnostic in all volunteers and patients. In the five patients, the examination revealed the known pathologies [aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery ( n=1), renal artery stenosis ( n=1), myocardial infarct ( n=1), and colonic polyp ( n=2)]. The outlined MR screening strategy encompassing the brain, the arterial system, the heart, the lung, and the colon is feasible.

Although a mimic of molar pregnancies and other entities, it can be distinguished from them by its association with intrauterine growth restriction or death of a relatively normal fetus and its characteristic histopathology. We report the case of a 20-year-old primigravida who presented at 16 weeks with heavy clotty vaginal bleeding and subsequent miscarriage. The placenta was grossly abnormal and resembled a partial molar pregnancy. PMD was confirmed by microscopic examination. Postmiscarriage, ultrasound revealed enlarged and multicystic ovaries similar to those seen in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which returned to normal a few weeks after miscarriage. This is the first report of PMD associated with OHSS, and we hypothesise that the most likely pathogenesis is ovarian stimulation from PMD-derived vascular endothelial growth factor."

All women with infertility attending the GOPD from 11th September 2006 to 15th February 2007 were recruited to the study. Information on socio-demographic, obstetric and menstrual characteristics was collected. Anthropometric measurement, clinical examination of acne and hirsutism, vaginal ultrasonography for PCO and biochemical analysis of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone were performed. All 102 women who attended the GOPD during the study period due to infertility were recruited. Two women were excluded after diagnosis of pregnancy made by hormonal assay and ultrasonography thus remaining with 100 women for analysis. Oligomenorrhoea and acne were significantly higher in a group of women with PCO than among women with normal ovaries. The mean hirsutism score though was not significant, was higher in women with PCO than in women with normal ovaries (5.1 +/- 2.7 vs. 4 +/- 2.4, P < 0.057). Using the Rotterdam criteria 32 (32%) women were diagnosed to have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Among these women 25 (78.1%) had PCO, 24 (75%) had signs of oligoanovulation, and 18 (56.3%) had hirsutism. Among 68 women with no PCOS, 7 (10.3%) had polycystic ovaries, 15 (22.1%) had signs of oligoanovulation and 6 (8.8%) had hirsutism. In conclusion, polycystic ovaries are common among women with infertility, however are not necessarily associated with polycystic ovary syndrome. Doctors should investigate their clients for PCOS and offer appropriate treatment."

The objective of this study is to estimate the frequency, to analyze the clinicopathologic features, to explore the possible pathogenetic factors, and to discuss the differential diagnosis of this entity. We reviewed the pathology reports of 379 patients who underwent surgery for leiomyomas at our institution, from 1999 until 2003, and we identified five cases of leiomyomas with massive lymphocytic infiltration. Thereafter, we reviewed the records of these five patients to identify the clinical, ultrasonographic, and surgical findings they had presented. Leiomyomas with lymphocytic infiltration were characterized by the presence of small lymphocytes, few plasma cells, and occasional germinal lymphocytes such as lymphoblasts confined into the leiomyoma. Immunohistochemistry was positive for desmin and leukocyte common antigen and showed a positive reaction to kappa and lambda light chains that is consistent with the polyclonal nature of an inflammatory infiltration. Gross appearance and ultrasonographic and color Doppler findings were the same as of a typical leiomyoma. Lymphocytic infiltration of leiomyomas is a rare histological entity. Although an inflammatory process seems to be the pathogenetic factor, other mechanisms such as an immunological or autoimmune response, a specific human leukocyte antigen alteration, or a viral infection could also be the cause of this entity. Differential diagnosis must be made from malignant lymphoma, pyomyoma, and inflammatory pseudotumor of the uterus, based on their special histological characteristics."
CD011126,0,20709417,0,Clinical evidence on PET-CT for radiation therapy planning in cervix and endometrial cancers.,"PET-CT plays an increasing role in the diagnosis and treatment of gynaecological cancers. In cervix cancer, whilst MRI remains the best imaging technique for initial primary tumor staging, PET-CT has been showed to be a highly sensitive method to determine lymph node status, except in patients with early-stage cervical cancer where PET-CT cannot replace surgical exploration of pelvic lymph nodes. In patients with advanced cervical cancer, PET-CT has the potential of showing lymph node metastasis not only within the pelvis, but also outside the pelvis, more particularly in the para-aortic area. PET-CT has also been described as a useful tool in 3-D-based adaptative brachytherapy. In endometrial cancer, the issues are different, as the recent decade has seen a therapeutic decrease in early-stage disease, especially in postoperative radiation therapy, whilst more advanced disease have been approached with more aggressive treatments, integrating chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. Lymph node status is also an important issue and PET-Scan may replace lymph node surgical procedure particularly in obese patients."

During the past 3 decades, ultrasound technology has been extended to clinical dermatology. High-frequency ultrasound systems with 20- to 50-MHz probes are used for the assessment of tumoral and inflammatory processes of the skin, providing information about their axial and lateral extension. They are of special interest in preoperative situations and for the monitoring of skin conditions under therapy. In contrast to high-frequency ultrasound systems, the value of ultrasound technology with the use of 7.5- to 15-MHz probes generally is not accepted worldwide, although it can be used easily and without significant side effects. Promising results have been reported from specialized diagnostic centers, especially for the assessment of peripheral lymph nodes and soft-tissue tumors. Although it is unable to provide malignancy specific information, ultrasound is nonetheless helpful in the follow-up of patients undergoing, for example, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The 3-dimensional size and outline of a tumor as well as its relation to surrounding structures like vessels can be described. Moreover, information about the tumor quality (solid, cyst, complex) and the inner structure of a tumor (hypoechoic, hyperechoic, homogenous, inhomogenous, calcification foci, necroses) can be provided.

MEDLINE and PubMed were searched using the keywords adenomyosis and adenomyosis diagnosis. Reviews, case-controlled studies and reports published from 1949 through March 2005 and written, or at least abstracted, in English were analyzed. Transvaginal sonography is superior to the transabdominal route, but its diagnostic sensitivity is still suboptimal, ranging from 50% to 87%. Magnetic resonance imaging is most effective for both diffuse and focal adenomyosis, with sensitivity and specificity that are comparable to or even better than those of sonography as it depicts contrasts between low-intensity lesions and surrounding tissue. Computed tomography has poor diagnostic value due to similar images portrayed by foci and normal myometrium. Myometrial biopsy of the posterior uterine wall, as pursued by some authorities in recent years, is superior to sonography, but its routine use is not recommended. Although various methods were added to the clinician's armamentarium over the last 2 decades, the preoperative diagnosis of adenomyosis remains challenging."

CD011126,0,24852312,0,Algorithmic approach to solid adnexal masses and their mimics: utilization of anatomic relationships and imaging features to facilitate diagnosis.,"Solid adnexal masses, while less common than their cystic counterparts, may present a challenge for radiologists given the wide range of histologic entities that occur in this region. Pelvic masses, especially when large, can seem overwhelming at first but application of an algorithmic approach allows for more confident assessment. This approach focuses first on the use of anatomic relationships and interactions of various pelvic structures to localize the mass' origin. For instance, the directionality of ureteral displacement can suggest if a mass is intra or extraperitoneal. Then, key discriminating imaging features, such as the presence of fat, hypervascularity, or low T2 signal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be applied to further narrow the list of diagnostic possibilities. Entities such as leiomyomas, nerve sheath tumors, congenital uterine anomalies, and vascular abnormalities (ovarian torsion or iliac vessel aneurysm) in particular are often accurately characterized with sonography and/or MRI. For solid adnexal masses in which a definitive diagnosis by imaging is not reached, information germane to clinicians regarding further management can still be provided, principally with regard to surgical vs. nonsurgical treatment."

CD011126,0,20638908,0,IVF and embryo development subsequent to ovarian torsion occurring during the resumption of meiosis.,"This report describes an unusual case of ovarian torsion during an IVF cycle prior to vaginal oocyte retrieval and the subsequent embryo development. A 27-year-old, whose husband carries a balanced translocation, presented on stimulation day 11 (day after human chorionic gonadotrophin administration) with signs of right ovarian torsion. Transvaginal ultrasound identified decreased right ovarian venous flow but preservation of right ovarian arterial flow. She underwent emergency laparoscopic right ovarian detorsion followed by vaginal oocyte retrieval on postoperative day 1. Ten oocytes were retrieved from the right detorted ovary, 4/10 (40%) were fertilized and 3/4 (75%) became blastocysts. Fifteen oocytes were retrieved from the left ovary, 14/15 (93%) were fertilized and 9/14 (64%) became blastocysts. All 18 embryos biopsied for preimplantation genetic diagnosis carried unbalanced translocations and none were transferred. The markedly reduced fertilization rate of the oocytes from the previously torted ovary is similar to the rate described in a prior report and likely related to decreased but maintained ovarian arterial flow. This report is unique because not only was the patient's ovarian torsion surgically corrected prior to oocyte retrieval but also the embryos originating from the previously torted ovary had excellent development with 75% progressing to the blastocyst stage."

Infertility and recurrent miscarriage are relatively common problems in the female population. Diagnostic algorithms in such cases include the evaluation of uterine anatomy Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate technique for visualizing the female genitourinary tract anatomy but as it is expensive and not readily available, it is not useful in everyday practice. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a frequently performed procedure that plays an important role in evaluating the uterus and fallopian tubes. The most typical indication for HSG is infertility and recurrent miscarriage, which are common problems in the female population. However this procedure is invasive, exposes the patient to ionizing radiation, carries a risk of complications and does not show the external contour of the uterus, which is essential for differentiating uterine anomalies. Three dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (3D TV USG) is a noninvasive and quick, imaging method that may be used in diagnosing uterine anomalies. This method allows evaluate the external contours of the uterus, making it comparable to MRI."

There is no consensus about the management of patients diagnosed with endometrial polyp in IVF cycles. In this study, nine patients who underwent assisted reproduction treatment cycles were diagnosed with endometrial polyps less than 1.5 cm by transvaginal ultrasonography. Eight patients were treated by long protocol and one patient was the recipient of an egg donation cycle. In all patients, polyp resection was performed through hysteroscopic polypectomy. Polypectomy was done during ovarian stimulation in the standard treatment cycles, and during hormone replacement therapy in the recipient of the egg donation cycle. The interval between polyp resection and embryo transfer was 2-16 days. Four patients achieved pregnancy (two twins, two singletons), four patients were unsuccessful, and one pregnancy was a blighted ovum. All of the successful pregnancies are still ongoing. There is a dilemma regarding the management of patients diagnosed with endometrial polyps in assisted reproduction treatment cycles. If polypectomy before embryo transfer in an IVF cycle is proven to be safe, then embryos will be transferred without cycle cancellation. This study included nine patients; further studies with more patients are required to confirm these findings."

C-Reactive protein (CRP) has been implicated as a vascular disease risk factor. The objective of this study was to determine whether elevated CRP is associated with increased carotid intima-media wall thickness (IMT) in PCOS women. Forty-seven PCOS patients and 59 similarly aged controls were screened for cardiovascular risk factors and concurrently underwent carotid ultrasonography (1996-1999). The main outcome measure was carotid IMT. CRP was significantly higher in PCOS patients than in controls (3.4 vs. 2.1 mg/dl; P = 0.002). In regression modeling, PCOS associated with IMT independently of CRP and age (P = 0.019). Body mass index reduced the association of PCOS and CRP with IMT and was also associated with IMT (P = 0.029). The CRP-IMT relationship was attenuated when either insulin or visceral fat was included in the PCOS-age-CRP model (P = 0.197 and P = 0.550, respectively). PCOS remained associated with IMT independent of insulin (P = 0.033) or visceral fat (P = 0.040). CRP does not appreciably mediate the effect of PCOS on IMT. Obesity partially explained the influence of PCOS and CRP on IMT. The effect of body mass index on the PCOS-IMT relationship was not completely determined by hyperinsulinemia or visceral fat, and might be mediated by other aspects of PCOS-related adiposity."

Little data exist on the accuracy of imaging studies in the diagnosis of appendicitis in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the probability of ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan in diagnosing appendicitis in pregnancy, as reflected in the negative appendectomy rate. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 86 pregnant women who underwent an appendectomy between January 1, 1997 and January 1, 2006. Patients were divided into three groups: clinical evaluation, ultrasound, and ultrasound followed by a CT scan. The clinical evaluation group had 13 patients, with a negative appendectomy rate of 54% (7/13). Fifty-five patients underwent an ultrasound alone, with a negative appendectomy rate 36% (20/55). In the ultrasound/CT group (n=13), the negative appendectomy rate was 8% (1/13). There was a significant reduction in the negative appendectomy rate in the ultrasound/CT scan group compared to clinical evaluation group (54 vs 8%, p<0.05).

Although some women with bowel endometriosis may be asymptomatic, the majority of them develop a variety of gastrointestinal complains. No clear guideline exists for the evaluation of patients with suspected bowel endometriosis. Given the fact that, besides rectal nodules, bowel endometriosis can not be diagnosed by physical examination, imaging techniques should be used. Several techniques have been proposed for the diagnosis of bowel endometriosis including double-contrast barium enema, transvaginal ultrasonography, rectal endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and multislice computed tomography enteroclysis. Medical management of bowel endometriosis is currently speculative; expectant management should be carefully balanced with the severity of symptoms and the feasibility of prolonged follow-up. Several studies demonstrated an improvement in quality of life after extensive surgical excision of the disease. Bowel endometriotic nodules can be removed by various techniques: mucosal skinning, nodulectomy, full thickness disc resection, and segmental resection.

The pathogenesis of this condition is likely to be multifactorial. The aim of the retrospective study was to present management in moderate and severe iatrogenic ovarian hyperstymulation syndrome (OHSS) in clinical material. The study group was 19 women, admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Central Clinical Hospital of Ministry of Interior and Administration in Warsaw from large outpatient infertility center ""Novum"" in Warsaw with moderate and severe OHSS between 14.07.2004 and 8.11.2005. Laboratory tests and ultrasound examination of the ovarian size and ascites were performed, abdominal circumference was measured. Patients were treated with rehydration with intravenous crystalloids and colloids, diuretics, antibiotics, anticoagulants and ultrasound-guided paracentesis if symptoms of ascites become severe (ascites causes pain and compromised pulmonary function). Oral intake of water was restricted, monitoring of fluid intake and output, and daily monitoring of body weight was performed. During treatment controlled laboratory tests were done. In one patient occurred intra-abdominal hemorrhage from ovarian rupture and laparotomy with oophorectomy was performed. The ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is still a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic problem and more studies are required to elucidate pathophysiology of OHSS. Because of still unknown etiology treatment is empirical and in most of cases bases on experience of medical team.

Since silent uterine rupture has potential risk for complete uterine rupture, which leads to acute life-threatening complications for both the mother and baby, it is difficult to determine whether to manage expectantly or surgically, including repair of the uterine wall or termination of the pregnancy, especially in the early second trimester. We present here a case of a herniated amniotic sac with overstretched uterine wall of the fundus presenting as silent uterine rupture, which was incidentally detected on routine ultrasonography at 18 weeks' gestation in a 38-year-old primigravida with a history of myomectomy for diffuse uterine leiomyomatosis. Magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed that the myometrium thickness was fully maintained at the site of the foetal membranes ballooning. The pregnancy was therefore managed expectantly and continued to successful delivery at 30 weeks' gestation. The precise assessment of the uterine wall may be essential to manage a herniated amniotic sac presenting as silent uterine rupture and to optimise the outcome of the pregnancy. We review all cases of a herniated amniotic sac out of focally overstretched uterine wall before 34 weeks' gestation."

The existing data cannot be easily compared due to the heterogeneity of the research design and methodology and the number of prospective randomized trials of sufficient sample size is limited. In addition, more research in the identification and understanding of underlying factors is needed together with a better understanding of the patho-physiological basis of ovarian ageing and of the progressive reduction in ovarian reserve. This paper provides an overview on the identification, prediction and management of poor responders undergoing medicated assisted reproduction treatment."

CD011126,0,19175147,0,Multiphasic contrast injection for improved precision of parameter estimates in functional CT.,"Contrast injection protocol is known to affect the estimation of kinetic parameters in functional CT. A novel method is proposed to maximize the precision of parameter estimates by modulating the contrast injection scheme. The method models the intravenous contrast bolus to be dispersed by a ""patient function"" to give rise to the arterial input function, which, in turn, carries the contrast agent to tissue leading to contrast enhancement. The covariance matrix analysis was applied to calculate the uncertainty of parameter estimates as the coefficients of variation (CV) in the adiabatic tissue homogeneity (ATH), two-compartment, and the modified Kety model in which tumor pathophysiology is modeled. An optimization scheme was used to determine the optimal injection protocol which would minimize the CV of a particular kinetic parameter. For clinical utility, a recommended injection protocol was suggested from a statistical analysis with the optimal injection protocols obtained from the first group of 12 patients with cervix cancer. The efficacy of the recommended injection protocol was tested with a second group of 12 patients. In addition, the robustness of the recommended injection protocol to longitudinal study has been investigated in the presence of variations in arterial input function and tumor pathophysiology. Based on the data of the second group of patients, and using the ATH model, the recommended biphasic injection of two boluses improves the precision in the estimation of blood flow and mean transit time (MTT), by 36.9% and 38.4%, respectively, compared to the standard uniphasic injection protocol in the CV. However, measurement of the permeability surface area product and extravascular extracellular space volume favors a single fast bolus of the same contrast amount. The two-compartment model and the modified Kety model also benefited from the single fast bolus. The effect of variation in the arterial input function and tumor pathophysiology on the applicability of the recommended injection was also investigated. Based on computer simulation for a range of variations in the arterial input function and pathophysiology, the recommended biphasic injection was found to improve the precision in blood flow and MTT estimates by 31.4% and 36.5% on average, respectively, compared to the uniphasic injection."
CD011126,0,20647776,0,Polyploid megakaryocytes can complete cytokinesis.,"Megakaryocytes (MK) undergo polyploidization through endomitosis, a mitotic process that ends prematurely due to aborted cytokinesis. To better understand this and other events associated with MK differentiation, we performed long-term and large-field live cell imaging of human MKs derived in cord blood (CB) and bone marrow (BM) CD34(+) cell cultures. Polyploid level of imaged cells was evaluated using three complementary approaches; cell history, cell size and ploidy correlation and nuclei staining. This system and strategy enabled the direct observation of the development of a large number of MKs (n=4865) and to quantify their fates. The most significant finding of this study is that a considerable proportion of polyploid MKs could complete cytokinesis. This unexpected process gave rise to polyploid daughter cell(s) with normal fates and contributed significantly to the expansion of polyploid MKs. Further analyses revealed that the proliferation rate amongst polyploid MKs was inversely correlated to their ploidy level, and that this phenomenon was much more frequent in CB- than BM-derived MKs. Accordingly, endomitosis was identified as the dominant fate of polyploid BM-MKs, while this was less accentuated for polyploid CB-MKs. These findings explain partially why CB-derived MKs remain in lower ploidy class. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the development of polyploid MK results from the failure and/or success of cytokinesis and brings a new paradigm to the field of megakaryopoiesis."

CD011126,0,17304035,0,Polycystic ovary syndrome: early detection in the adolescent.,"The primary clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are hirsutism and irregular menstrual bleeding due to ovarian androgen excess and chronic anovulation. Historically, these features emerge late in puberty or shortly thereafter. The presence of insulin resistance or obesity, both commonly associated with this disorder, seems to further amplify the severity of the presentation. Perhaps, the most important finding is that of progressive hirsutism. Irregular menstrual bleeding is less reliable unless the duration of menstrual irregularity is persistent. However, mild hair growth and chronic anovulation are also regarded as normal components of the late stages of puberty and early adolescence and may persist for several years. It is for this reason that the diagnosis is often not made until later in life when endocrine and metabolic dysfunctions have been firmly established. The evolution of PCOS during early adolescence is not well-understood, but seems to involve abnormal activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian-adrenal axis accompanied by specific morphologic changes of the ovary. Efforts to minimize the clinical features of PCOS in young adolescent girls depend on early diagnosis and timely suppression of excess ovarian androgen production."
CD011126,0,23258642,0,Ultrasonographic determination of caput epididymis diameter is strongly predictive of obstruction in the genital tract in azoospermic men with normal serum FSH.,"The relationship between epididymis ultrasonography (US) and infertility is poorly defined probably owing to lack of objective and reproducible criteria of US evaluation. Here, we evaluated US size of testes, caput and of corpus epididymis in infertile men: 165 with total sperm count ≥39 × 10(6) , 187 with total sperm count <39 × 10(6) and 75 azoospermic men. Blood levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and of total testosterone were also evaluated. US measures obtained using a high-frequency (12 MHz) linear array transducer, included the mean value of bilateral testicular volumes (mL) (Testes-M), of bilateral longitudinal diameter of caput epididymis (mm) (Caput-M) and of the bilateral antero-posterior diameter of the corpus measured on a longitudinal scan (mm) (Corpus-M). Testicular histology of azoospermic men was obtained and the percentage of seminiferous tubules with elongated spermatids (%T) was used to classify cases with normal spermatogenesis (obstructive azoospermia) (n = 17; %T ≥ 80), or with deranged spermatogenesis (n = 58; %T ≤ 33). Caput-M was correlated with Testes-M (p = 0.0003; r = 0.17) and with FSH serum levels (p = 0.024; r = -0.14) but not with semen parameters. Caput-M but not Corpus-M values resulted greater in obstructive azoospermia compared with other groups, but difference was not significant. Cut-off values of Testes-M, Caput-M and of FSH correctly classified cases of obstructive azoospermia (AUC > 0.5). A patient with FSH < 7.8 IU/mL had a 63.6% chance (CI 40.1-83.2%) of being affected by obstructive azoospermia. US Caput-M ≥10.85 mm, which represented the cut-off value with the highest combination of sensitivity (58.8%, CI 32.9-81.6%) and specificity (91.4%, CI 81.0-97.1%) applied in cases with FSH < 7.8 IU/mL increased the probability for obstructive azoospermia from 63.6% up to 92.3% (CI 76.5-98.8%). US evaluation of the caput epididymis diameter helped in predicting the obstructive origin of azoospermia when FSH was not increased, whereas it was not relevant in non-azoospermic men."
CD011126,0,16092328,0,A new path planning algorithm for maximizing visibility in computed tomography colonography.,"In virtual colonoscopy, minimizing the blind areas is important for accurate diagnosis of colonic polyps. Although useful for describing the shape of an object, the centerline is not always the optimal camera path for observing the object. Hence, conventional methods in which the centerline is directly used as a path produce considerable blind areas, especially in areas of high curvature. Our proposed algorithm first approximates the surface of the object by estimating the overall shape and cross-sectional thicknesses. View positions and their corresponding view directions are then jointly determined to enable us to maximally observe the approximated surface. Moreover, by adopting bidirectional navigations, we may reduce the blind area blocked by haustral folds. For comfortable navigation, we carefully smoothen the obtained path and minimize the amount of rotation between consecutive rendered images. For the evaluation, we quantified the overall observable area on the basis of the temporal visibility that reflects the minimum interpretation time of a human observer. The experimental results show that our algorithm improves visibility coverage and also significantly reduces the number of blind areas that have a clinically meaningful size.

CD011126,0,7959338,0,Studies on the influence of ovarian small cysts on endocrine in patients with polycystic ovaries.,"To clarify the influence of small follicular cysts in ovaries on endocrine in ovulatory patients with multifollicular ovaries (MFO), the comparative study of endocrine among ovulatory patients with MFO and anovulatory patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) were examined. In ovulatory patients with MFO, there was no significant correlation between the increase in the number of ovarian cysts and gonadotropin levels, however, estrone and androgen levels tended to increase as the number of cysts increased. LH levels in PCOS were significantly higher than those in patients with more than 10 small cysts; however, there was no significant difference in androgen levels between the two. It was suggested that MFO is a progressive disease and that the presence of more than 10 small follicular cysts in each ovary in ovulatory women may be latent PCOS."

We reviewed the medical records of 19 girls with TS and premature ovarian failure (POF), aged 13 to 17 years, who were referred to our adolescent gynecology clinic for ERT. Nine patients were treated with 0.5 mg estradiol valerate (EV) and 10 patients were treated with 1 mg EV as an initial estrogen dose for 1 year. Breast development, changes in uterine size and bone mineral density were measured before and after 1 year of ERT. All patients showed breast budding after 1 year of ERT regardless of estrogen dosage. Uterine development in patients treated with 1 mg EV advanced farther in 1 year of treatment than in patients given 0.5 mg EV. In patients treated with 1 mg EV, uterine length increased by 39.8% and AP fundal diameter by 46%, increments greater than in patients receiving 0.5 mg EV. After 1 year of ERT, bone mineral densities (BMD) increased significantly in both groups, although BMD did not differ significantly between the groups. In conclusion, ERT with 1mg of EV, as a starting dose induced better uterine development than 0.5 mg in prepubertal girls with TS."

CD011126,0,15860113,0,Ovarian follicular development stimulated by leuprorelin acetate plus human menopausal gonadotropin in chimpanzees.,"We attempted ovarian stimulation using gonadotropins in 14 chimpanzees. Subjects were given a single administration of leuprorelin acetate, followed by repeated administration of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) for 16-21 days. During the dosing period, the ovarian follicle diameter and count were measured by transvaginal ultrasonography. The hormone administration induced the development of multiple follicles, and multiple oocytes were subsequently retrieved. However, the follicle count was decreased, suggesting atresia, in some subjects. Statistically, the final follicle diameter was dependent on the dosing duration and the hMG dose in the late stage, while the maximum follicle count during hMG administration was dependent on age and the hMG dose in the early stage. Five subjects showed mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)-like symptoms with a high serum estradiol (E2) concentration. These results suggest that leuprorelin acetate plus hMG administration successfully stimulates the development of multiple ovarian follicles for oocyte retrieval and that the serum E2 concentration is predictive of OHSS-like symptoms in chimpanzees."

Hematoperitoneum as a complication of gynecologic diseases represents acute condition which is usually caused by the hemorrhagic corpus luteum or a rupture of either ectopic pregnancy or a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. The authors present a unique case of conservatively managed massive hematoperitoneum caused by ovulation in a patient with severe form of von Willebrand disease who had right adnexectomy due to hemorrhagic corpus luteum four months prior. This conservative management by blood product and factor concentrate support could be a method of choice in selected hemodynamically stable patients.

However, nonstandardized formation and limited downstream adaptability of 3D cultures have hindered mainstream adoption of these systems for biological applications, especially for low- and moderate-throughput assays commonly used in biomedical research. Here we build on our recent development of a 384-well hanging drop plate for spheroid culture to design a complementary spheroid transfer and imaging (TRIM) plate. The low-aspect ratio wells of the TRIM plate facilitated high-fidelity, user-independent, contact-based collection of hanging drop spheroids. Using the TRIM plate, we demonstrated several downstream analyses, including bulk tissue collection for flow cytometry, high-resolution low working-distance immersion imaging, and timely reagent delivery for enzymatic studies. Low working-distance multiphoton imaging revealed a cell type-dependent, macroscopic spheroid structure. Unlike ovarian cancer spheroids, which formed loose, disk-shaped spheroids, human mammary fibroblasts formed tight, spherical, and nutrient-limited spheroids. Beyond the applications we describe here, we expect the hanging drop spheroid plate and complementary TRIM plate to facilitate analyses of spheroids across the spectrum of throughput, particularly for bulk collection of spheroids and high-content imaging."
CD011126,0,23366914,0,Ovarian tumor characterization and classification: a class of GyneScan™ systems.,"In this work, we have developed an adjunct Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique that uses 3D acquired ultrasound images of the ovary and data mining algorithms to accurately characterize and classify benign and malignant ovarian tumors. In this technique, we extracted image-texture based and Higher Order Spectra (HOS) based features from the images. The significant features were then selected and used to train and test the Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The proposed technique was validated using 1000 benign and 1000 malignant images, obtained from 10 patients with benign and 10 with malignant disease, respectively. On evaluating the classifier with 10-fold stratified cross validation, we observed that the DT classifier presented a high accuracy of 95.1%, sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 97.7%. Thus, the four significant features could adequately quantify the subtle changes and nonlinearities in the pixel intensities. The preliminary results presented in this paper indicate that the proposed technique can be reliably used as an adjunct tool for ovarian tumor classification since the system is accurate, completely automated, cost-effective, and can be easily written as a software application for use in any computer."

The authors report two cases of RHP which were diagnosed at the time of labor induction following fetal death diagnosis. Although the failure of prostaglandin induction to initiate labor could suggest that an additional obstructive Müllerian uterine anomaly is present, a directed investigation of such anomaly is more acceptable in cases of antepartum fetal death or atypical mid-trimester abdominal pain. Therefore, a high index of suspicion combined with clinical and imagiological findings are important to establish a correct diagnosis of pre-rupture RHP."

CD011126,0,17372244,0,Validity of self-reports of return for routine repeat screening in an ovarian cancer screening program.,"Cancer screening research relies on reliable and valid measurement of cancer screening behavior. Self-reports of screening constitute a cost-effective approach to measuring screening behavior; however, demonstration of suitable validity of these self-reports is critical. We evaluated the validity of self-report of return for repeat, routine, annual transvaginal sonography (TVS) screening for ovarian cancer. Participants (n = 535) in a university-based ovarian cancer screening program for asymptomatic, average risk women completed a telephone interview 18 months following an initial, baseline TVS screening test. Self-reports of return for a repeat, routine ovarian cancer screening test since baseline were obtained and compared with objective records of repeat screening from the screening program database. Overall agreement of self-reports and objective records of ovarian cancer screening was 97.57% (kappa = 0.94). Sensitivity was 0.98, specificity was 0.96, positive predictive value was 0.98, and negative predictive value was 0.96. The month of last screening was accurately identified by 80% of participants. It was concluded the validity of self-reports of TVS screening for ovarian cancer is very high and may even exceed the validity of self-reports of participation in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening over similar recall periods. Consequently, self-reports of TVS screening may serve as a cost-effective substitute for more objective methods of assessing TVS screening behavior."
CD011126,0,16390709,0,Ovarian cancer death reduction for women at high risk: workload implications for gynaecology services.,"Ovarian cancer spreads early, presents late and is difficult to cure. Reducing death rates from ovarian malignancy has focussed on the unaffected females of families with a high chance of a mutant gene such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. We set up a familial ovarian cancer service in a district general hospital in the UK, serving a population of 330,000. The clinical genetics team acted as gatekeepers to the service. Risk assessment, ultrasound and biochemical screening and prophylactic oophorectomy were discussed. Gene testing was offered when appropriate. This study reviews the levels of activity for the first 8 years of the service. In all, 153 women were referred, of whom 34 (16%) did not have significant clinical histories. Of the 114 who fulfilled the UKFOCSS criteria for family history and age, four were quickly found to be gene mutation negative and 20 (17%) declined intervention. A total of 29 (25%) chose prophylactic oophorectomy and 61 (54%) chose ultrasound screening."

There is not sufficient data about prognostic value of ultrasound scanning of structure of endometrium before or after the day of HCG administration in IVF cycles. Several authors have revealed differences in endometrial structure between the women with or without pregnancy. According to the results of our studies, the endometrium thickness has a rather positive prognostic index for evaluating the possibility of the occurrence of pregnancy. Therefore, it is a highly informative ultrasound criterion for making a decision of the completion of superovulation induction and introduction of the embryo transfer and, consequently, makes an important contribution to the in vitro fertilization procedure optimization."

The authors describe the successful operative treatment of a patient with, to the best of their knowledge, the largest perineural cyst reported to date. A 29-year-old woman had been suffering from long-standing constipation and low-back pain. During an obstetric investigation for infertility, the clinician discovered a huge presacral cystic mass. Computed tomography myelography showed the lesion to be a huge Tarlov cyst arising from the left S-3 nerve root and compressing the ipsilateral S-2 nerve. The cyst was successfully treated by ligation of the cyst neck together with sectioning of the S-3 nerve root. Postoperative improvement in her symptoms and MR imaging findings were noted. Identification of the nerve root involved by the cyst wall, operative indication, operative procedure, and treatment of multiple cysts are important preoperative considerations."
CD011126,0,16529108,0,Annular phased-array high-intensity focused ultrasound device for image-guided therapy of uterine fibroids.,"An ultrasound (US), image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device was developed for noninvasive ablation of uterine fibroids. The HIFU device was an annular phased array, with a focal depth range of 30-60 mm, a natural focus of 50 mm, and a resonant frequency of 3 MHz. The in-house control software was developed to operate the HIFU electronics drive system for inducing tissue coagulation at different distances from the array. A novel imaging algorithm was developed to minimize the HIFU-induced noise in the US images. The device was able to produce lesions in bovine serum albumin-embedded polyacrylamide gels and excised pig liver. The lesions could be seen on the US images as hyperechoic regions. Depths ranging from 30 to 60 mm were sonicated at acoustic intensities of 4100 and 6100 W/cm2 for 15 s each, with the latter producing average lesion volumes at least 63% larger than the former. Tissue sonication patterns that began distal to the transducer produced longer lesions than those that began proximally. The variation in lesion dimensions indicates the possible development of HIFU protocols that increase HIFU throughput and shorten tumor treatment times."

Non-specific symptoms such as lower abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, and genital bleeding sometimes occur with congenital uterine anomalies such as this. It is very difficult to diagnose OHVIRA syndrome accurately without ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, and patients can develop severe complications as a result of delays in diagnosis: endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, or infertility can occur through backflow of genital bleeding because of vaginal septum.
